"Cesar Azpilicueta is the standout stopper in the Premier League, according to Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher. The Spain defender has helped Chelsea get off to a near-perfect start to the season, with the unbeaten Blues four points clear at the top of the table after 10 games. Azpilicueta has made the left-back berth his own and was named as the best defender by the Monday Night Football pundits. Cesar Azpilicueta has been named as the best defender in the Premier League . John Terry closely follows his Chelsea team-mate, according to Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher . 'I'd say, for consistency of performances, it would be one of the Chelsea lads – and I'd probably say Azpilicueta,' Neville told Monday Night Football. 'For technical defending, not making a mistake, not being in the wrong position, not getting caught out… I don't see him making a mistake. And I have to say the Chelsea defenders aren't far behind him; Gary Cahill, John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic. 'But Azpilicueta, when I watch him, he's as near to perfect as possible when it comes to defending; he's immaculate.' Neville believes Azpilcueta has produced 'near to perfect' performances for Chelsea this season . Carragher added: 'I totally agree. I think those Chelsea players, all of them, they defend properly. 'We see that in terms of the number of goals they've conceded, the clean sheets they keep. 'Azpilicueta is an out-and-out defender. You very rarely see anybody get the better of him. He'd be my number one.'","Monday Night Football pundits pick Chelsea star has standout stopper .

"It was one of those unavoidably surreal moments in broadcasting history. BBC presenters Julian Worricker and Sophie . Long were delivering the news from one side of a glass-screen studio . when a small figure in a turquoise coat loomed into view on the newsroom . behind them. The Queen was shown surrounded and all but mobbed by . dozens of staff, apparently ignoring instructions to remain in their . seats as the monarch toured the building. Newsflash: Presenters Julian Worricker and Sophie Long turn round to find the Queen has turned up during one their bulletins . Caught unawares: The newsreaders appeared a little flustered as their celebrity guest appeared in the background . Earlier she had sat motionless as she . listened to a special performance in the ‘Live Lounge’. Just for a moment, she seemed somewhat alone. Pensive: The Queen on a visit to the BBC yesterday, as Prince Philip underwent abdominal surgery . The cameras fleetingly caught her . looking reflective, the briefest of expressions to confirm there was a . great deal on the Queen’s mind yesterday. In . different circumstances the Duke of Edinburgh would have been at her . side for this, one of hundreds of engagements they carry out together . throughout a busy working year. But yesterday – not for the first time – she found herself unexpectedly on a solo mission to maintain business as usual . The Queen is . known to be a fan of classical music but she was treated to a rendition . of David Bowie’s ‘Heroes’ – which became a theme song for the Olympics – . by Irish band The Script. At . the end she chatted briefly to Script lead singer and Voice host Danny . O’Donoghue and when she learnt he was playing the Glastonbury festival, . joked about the mud. She said: ‘Glastonbury, the place you get covered . in mud? The singer replied with a laugh: ‘You’ve got to bring good . wellies.’ The Queen was at the BBC’s new . £1billion Broadcasting House headquarters on the fringes of the West . End, a tour that had been on each of their diaries for months. A . thousand yards away, the Duke was preparing to go under anaesthetic for . an operation at The London Clinic. For . each of these two most senior royals, at a time when they are gently . being advised to pull back from the most arduous engagements they . undertake, more lone appearances such as this could easily be a taste of . the future. He will not be alongside her for two key events next week, Beating Retreat, and Trooping the Colour. Guided tour: The Queen visited the BBC to officially open the new £1 billion studios in Portland Place, central London . Joining in: Radio 4 presenters Sian Williams (left) and James Naughtie sit alongside the Queen . Speech: Speaking on Radio 4 and the World Service she said how she had been to the original Broadcasting House with her parents before the war and then later before her Coronation, with Prince Philip . Happy: The Queen looked relaxed as Buckingham Palace said Prince Philip is 'progressing satisfactorily' after his operation . Not . that you would otherwise have detected any sign of easing off . yesterday, despite the last-minute logistical difficulties of turning a . two-person tour into one. Prince . Philip (‘Do I look bloody ill?’, as he angrily once put it) might not . have been cracking as many jokes as he had done at a Palace garden party . some 24 hours earlier, but even from his hospital bed, it is safe to . assume he would have wondered what all the fuss was about. The Queen, meanwhile, maintained her . usual calm, although she did have to unveil a yet-to-be corrected plaque . that declared she was accompanied by Prince Philip. Showstopper: Presenters on BBC Radio 4 do their best to maintain their cool despite their star guest . Drawing a crowd: The Queen maintained her usual calm as her appearance caused quite a stir at the BBC . On set: Her Majesty looking pleased as she walks past the Tardis during her tour . Stoic: The Queen remained utterly composed, despite not having Prince Philip by her side . Queen of the screen: Actress Jenny Agutter introduces herself to Her Majesty in front of a huge mural of Morecambe and Wise . Dutiful: Newsreader Huw Edwards bows as he shakes Her Majesty's hand . Greetings: Grinning Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw makes his introduction . Then she had to fend off a question . from fearless veteran broadcaster John Humphrys, apparently the only BBC . soul bold enough to ask how her husband was. ‘I have no idea,’ she . said, looking slightly displeased. ‘He’s only just gone in.’ Her . Majesty was escorted around the recently revamped building on a day . when she and the Duke were making headlines around the world. ‘Is that . me?’ she enquired, watching herself on the news screens. All smiles: The presenters turned around and laughed when they realised Britain's monarch was standing behind them in the studio . Chat: She spoke to lead singer  Danny O'Donoghue of The Script, and they briefly discussed Glastonbury, with her Majesty saying he should be careful of the mud . Royal performance: The Script played a cover of David Bowie's track 'Heroes' which became a theme song for the Olympics . Reflection: Only on once occasion did the Queen look to have something on her mind as she sat in the BBC's Live Lounge . Famous fan: The Queen is known to be a fan of classical music but appeared to be listening intently to The Script . Stars: Strictly Come Dancing presenter Tess . Daley was joined by Doctor Who actress Jenna-Louise Coleman also came to . Portland Place in Central London to see Her Majesty . Brave: The Queen still managed to  smile despite being forced to visit BBC  Broadcasting House without her beloved husband Prince Philip, who is in hospital nearby . She seemed unimpressed by the modern music (although she did volunteer later she was a big fan of EastEnders). Two more familiar icons of entertainment – Sir Bruce Forsyth and a Dalek – were among those who paid their respects. Brucie said afterwards it was ‘a great shame’ the Duke could not attend the opening. Her encounter with Humphrys came before the Today Programme stalwart presented her with a special edition digital radio. He wished her many happy hours of listening to the radio, only to be told rather waspishly: ‘Well I don’t get a lot of (time)...to listen to the radio.’ She was later shown an original television camera used during the Coronation broadcast, and was introduced to Sylvia Peters, the BBC announcer who introduced the coverage back in 1953. Miss Peters spoke to her about how people’s voices tend to get lower over the years. ‘I hadn’t noticed that,’ said the Queen, adding: ‘Maybe one’s been getting deaf.’ Aside from her reflective moment, the . Queen looked relaxed and at ease, appearing to enjoy meeting famous . faces from television and radio. Hundreds of BBC staff lined the . approach to the new building yesterday, many waving Union Jacks. Meet and greet: Sir Bruce Forsyth and his wife, . former Miss World Wilnelia Merced, as well as veteran broadcaster David . Dimbleby also met the Queen . Nice to meet you: The Queen says hello to Sir Bruce Forsyth with Dvid Dimbleby, Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman . Scores of office workers and shoppers also paused to watch the Queen arrive and depart, following the BBC journalists’ lead to take souvenir snapshots on their mobile phone cameras. Outside in the crowd, Iris McIntosh carried a ‘Get Well Soon’ card she planned to deliver to the clinic afterwards. ‘I’ve always liked the Duke,’ the 66-year-old charity worker said. ‘Of all the older royals, he seems to be the most down to earth.’ For all the proud history of Broadcasting House, possibly one of the most familiar addresses in the land, the Queen was still able to put it all into context. She was already six when the building was opened in 1932. She first visited it in 1939, when she was still princess Elizabeth, accompanying her father King George VI, and subsequently made four more visits, not including this one. In a live broadcast yesterday she said it was ‘a great pleasure’ to come again, adding: ‘I hope this new building will serve you well in the future.’ Guest of honour: The Queen was already six when Broadcasting House first opened in 1932 . Royal welcome: Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust (centre) and the BBC's new director general Tony Hall are ecstatic to meet Her Majesty on the red carpet . Royal arrival: Crowds turned out to greet Her Majesty as she arrived at Broadcasting House, five minutes away from where Prince Philip is in hospital . Pleased to see her: Flag-waving crowds turned out to wish Her Majesty well as she came to visit the BBC's £1bn home . Goodbye: Her Majesty smiles and waves to the crowds outside Broadcasting House as she heads back to the Palace . Together: Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip arrive to attend a garden party yesterday at the Palace . Guards: Police stand outside The London Clinic this morning, where Prince Philip has been brought for an operation . All smiles: The Queen presents the Duke with New Zealand's highest honour, the Order of New Zealand, in the presence of Sir Lockwood Smith, High Commissioner for New Zealand, at Buckingham Palace yesterday .

"Chelsey Davy's revealing, figure-hugging outfit will most certainly have turned heads at the society wedding of Lady Melissa Percy and Thomas van Straubenzee. And her appearance can even be compared to Pippa Middleton's scene-stealing display at the nuptials of Prince William and Kate. Prince Harry's ex, who was one of Lady Melissa's bridesmaids, arrived at St Michael's Church in Northumberland wearing a very revealing, scoop-neck taupe-coloured full-length dress that perhaps gave away more than she bargained for. Scroll down for video . Looking good: Chelsy Davy, the ex of Prince Harry, wore a figure-hugging dress designed by Bruce Oldfield, that emphasised her fabulous figure . Chelsy Davy looked in good spirits as she attended the society wedding . The dress was designed by Bruce Oldfield with flowers she was pictured carrying by local florist Caro Dickinson, who has also decorated the church and castle. It brings a flashback to the wedding of William and Kate, where it was the bride's sister Pippa who stole the show with a dress that emphasised her figure, and made her derrière world famous. And Chelsy similarly showed off her fabulous figure in this outfit. Helping hand: Chelsy Davy, along with a fellow bridesmaid, help keep the bride's train under control outside St Michael's Church . Remember this? Pippa Middleton raised plenty of eyebrows at the wedding of her sister Kate to Prince William, with her derrière making the headlines . Lady Melissa is a 26-year-old tennis coach while the groom is a chartered-surveyor and long-time friend of both William and Harry. The brothers were at the 30-year-old's London stag do earlier this month. Mr van Straubenzee travelled to New Zealand with William on a gap year and was reportedly on the phone to Harry when he was mugged in London last year. It was said that Harry alerted police and went out to find his friend after the ordeal. Lady Melissa is the Duke of Northumberland's second daughter. When her sister Lady Katie, a motorbike mechanic, married at St Michael's Church two years ago, Pippa Middleton was a guest. She is friends with Earl George Percy, the Duke's elder son. Having fun?

"Struggling French side Bastia have fired Claude Makelele after less than six months in charge. The former midfield general, who was part of the France team that lost the 2006 World Cup final to Italy, took over this season after a two-and-half year spell as assistant coach at Paris Saint-Germain. But after just 12 games in charge of the French side and them lying second bottom of Ligue 1, Makelele has been relieved of his duties. An anxious Claude Makelele looks on during his final game in charge of Bastia - a 1-0 defeat to Guingamp . Makelele and assistant Didier Tholot walk away from Bastia's training ground after being alerted of the news . Makelele talks to reporters after leaving Bastia's training ground after being sacked on Monday . The midfield general was a hugely popular figure for Chelsea during his time at the club . Makelele oversaw just two league victories in charge of Bastia, with their sixth defeat of the campaign against Guingamp on Saturday the final nail in the coffin of the former Chelsea midfielder's reign. An official statement on the club's official website read: 'Bastia board advise all supporters and partners that Mr Claude Makelele is no longer the coach of Sporting Club de Bastia.'

"Jose Mourinho should look to himself and his bosses rather than supporters if he wants to fix the atmosphere problem at Stamford Bridge. It’s true, the expectation of a comfortable win can breed complacency amongst supporters — but the club’s hierarchy have made it as hard as possible to arrest that slide. The prices — a problem across English football — have excluded a large number of Chelsea’s traditional fanbase from attending games regularly. Eden Hazard celebrates what turned out to be Chelsea's winning goal against QPR on Saturday . A single Chelsea fan before the match - but Mourinho claimed the whole match felt like the stadium was empty . For those who can shell out, anyone believed to be ‘persistently standing’ risks ejection from over-zealous stewards and letters threatening the removal of their season ticket. No cauldron of noise has ever been created by fans being forced to sit down. The travelling Chelsea support is far more vocal. Away games attract a younger crowd, with a high concentration of people who want to stand and sing. In SW6 those people are dotted all around the ground, making it hard to get an atmosphere going. It’s a great shame, because when the mood is right Stamford Bridge can really rock, with the crowd so close to the pitch. Chelsea fans were more vocal in the past - and away from home the support is always louder than the Bridge . Hazard (left) and Oscar (right) scored a goal apiece to secure three points for Chelsea . Chelsea fans carry a banner in support of Frank Lampard at their away match at Man City . Every plea fans have made to the powers that be for standing sections, greater concessions or unreserved seating has fallen on deaf ears.

Opposition supporters are now housed on the other side of the ground to the vocal Matthew Harding Stand, removing opportunity for the back-and-forth so often a catalyst for a lively atmosphere.","Jose Mourinho blasted the home atmosphere at Chelsea on Saturday .

"A former Chelsea academy footballer and lifelong supporter of the London club has died after being hit by taxi. Joe Reay, who played in the same Chelsea youth side as sprinter Adam Gemili, was struck by the car on Saturday evening and pronounced dead at the scene. After leaving his boyhood club, the 20-year-old moved to Conference Premier side Woking FC where his father is a director. Joe Reay (centre left) played alongside Adam Gemili (centre right) a Chelsea's academy .

'The club offers its deepest condolences to the Reay family at this difficult time. Joe was a respected member of Woking's Academy.' Tributes have since poured in for Reay. Gemili tweeted: 'Gutted to hear about a former team mate who died yesterday. R.I.P. Joe Reay. My thoughts are with his family.' Chelsea also took to social media to say: 'All at Chelsea FC are saddened by the death of former Academy player Joe Reay last weekend.

"Yann Kermorgant's penalty sent Bournemouth into second place in the Sky Bet Championship table after their pulsating 3-2 derby win over Brighton. Substitute Kermorgant fired the Cherries to their fifth league win on the spin after Lewis Dunk had fouled Callum Wilson in the box in the 75th minute. The French striker's effort came after Sam Baldock looked to have grabbed a point for the Seagulls with his first goal since signing from Bristol City. Substitute Yann Kermorgant stepped up to slot in the winning penalty for Bournemouth against Brighton . Sami Hyypia's men, who had twice got themselves back in the game after going behind, remain just above the relegation spots after one win from 12 league matches. The visitors started strongest in blustery conditions with a Gary Gardner free-kick being deflected just past a post. Eddie Howe's Cherries were making uncharacteristically sloppy passes in possession but did force the first real chance after 15 minutes. Matt Ritchie jinked his way into the box and forced a low save from Ali Al-Habsi, who was making his first league start of the season after signing from Wigan on Friday. Both teams had contrasting results against Barclays Premier League opposition in the Capital One Cup in midweek, with the home side knocking out West Brom and reaching the quarter-finals for the first time in their history. And things got worse for the Seagulls, who were knocked out by Tottenham, when captain Gordon Greer headed a fizzing Simon Francis cross into his own net to gift a 24th-minute opener. If Bournemouth did not deserve their goal, Brighton definitely did when it came three minutes later through Adrian Colunga's first of the campaign. Marc Pugh also scored as Bournemouth recorded a 3-2 victory in the derby against Brighton & Hove Albion . The Spaniard picked up on a defence-splitting pass from Joao Teixeira to round Artur Boruc and score only a second goal from one of the club's strikers this season. But the lead did not last long as Marc Pugh, fresh from his hat-trick last Saturday, saw his acrobatic volley fly past Al-Habsi via a deflection off the unlucky Dunk. After the break Hyypia's men continued to create opportunities to force the leveller and Dunk was inches away from heading a Jake Forster-Caskey free-kick past Boruc. Steve Cook, playing against his former club, then had to make a diving interception to block Teixeira's shot after a swooping break sent him through on goal. When Baldock's tidy finish from a ball forward from Al-Habsi made it 2-2 on the hour, Howe responded by hauling off the ineffective Brett Pitman and Matt Ritchie for Ryan Fraser and Kermorgant. And despite not showing the form which has seen them talked about as potential automatic promotion candidates, they pushed forward in search of the three points. Craig Mackail-Smith came on to try and rescue a draw but brave defending from Tommy Elphick denied him late on. Sam Baldock equalised for the second time for Brighton but they could not hold on and eventually lost .","Bournemouth won a pulsating south coast derby 3-2 on Saturday .

"Enough is enough. The suffering has to stop. Sam Warburton and his Wales team-mates will square up to their southern tormentors this month hell-bent on improving the record that haunts them. For all the achievements during Warren Gatland's tenure – two Grand Slams, a third championship title last year and coming so close to a place in the last World Cup Final – the roll-call of failure against the leading nations from the far side of the equator has become a cause for grave concern. Year after year after frustrating year, the SANZAR nations come to Cardiff, storm the barricades and make off with the silver. Wales skipper Sam Warburton is determined for his side to compete consistently at the top level . The results column is brutal. In these blue riband matches, under the current regime, Wales have played 25, won one, lost 24. That sole victory, against Australia in 2008, has been followed by nine consecutive defeats – eight of which have come by a single-figure margin. It has been a sporting death by a thousand tiny cuts. No wonder Warburton, as captain, is weary of the annual routine; the agony of optimism being expressed and then swiftly crushed. As he prepares to lead his country into their latest tussle with the Wallaby escape-artists, the Cardiff Blues flanker urgently craves an end to the waiting for a watershed win. 'I'm tired of talking about it,' he said. 'It's the same every year; the same questions and we always say, 'This is our year, this is our year'. 'People are always asking, 'What do you have to do differently to get the results?'. If I knew that, we would have done it four years ago. As long as we keep believing in ourselves and training hard, it definitely will happen one day. I'm very confident that we can get at least one win in those matches against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.' Unusually for a Welshman, Warburton admits to taking a certain amount of inspiration from the superior November exploits of the bitter rivals from across the Severn Bridge. Warburton is relishing the opportunity for Wales to put the record straight in the autumn Test Series . He added: 'You've got to respect England because, every year, they turn someone over in their autumn series and they deserve a lot of credit for that. All the Wales players are aware of how long it has gone on for and it would be a career highlight if we could beat a southern-hemisphere team. 'It would be a massive occasion for every Welsh player and there would be a massive celebration after it, because it's been such a big hurdle for so long. It builds more and more every year, the longer and longer it goes on.' When attempting to understand the reasons for the Welsh drought against the southern elite, Warburton identifies factors involving the mind and the lungs. In his view, the physical aspect is that the SANZAR teams operate better under extreme fatigue because they are more used to it due to the high-speed intensity of their rugby week after week. The mental aspect comes down to the simple issue of positive precedent creating belief. That's what England have in their favour. 'England have done it in the past,' said the 26-year-old. VIDEO Guinness tribute to Sam Warburton's hero and Wales legend, Shane Williams . Warburton says England's World Cup success in 2003 was crucial for their long-term future . 'That 2003 side gave England a massive boost for probably a decade after, because you know that players who are in that changing-room have gone out for those games and come back in with a win. It has happened. 'That's why it's so important to get over that first hurdle and when you've done it once, it's so much easier psychologically to do it again. It's like a high jumper who has jumped 2.30m before – they are much more likely to approach it differently the next time. 'I think that's the same for England; they play against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and they can refer back to five years ago, six years ago, eight years ago, when they won. Psychologically that does have a massively positive effect on you.' Setting his stall out for the autumn series at the Millennium Stadium, Warburton naturally insists that the initial objective is to win all four games. When he considers the backdrop of persistent Welsh defeat at this time of year, he concedes that a solitary big scalp would suffice to prove that Gatland's team are on an upward curve, but only if it is the start of a trend, not a glorious blip. Warburton (centre) will be hoping that Wales ca build on their Six Nations successes' in the Test series . 'When it does happen for us, I really do think it will start snowballing,' he said. 'But if it does happen for us, we can't get carried away. We can't think, 'Right, we've beaten Australia, we're a top-three side in the world'. Australia have beaten us nine times in a row so if we beat them once, we have to do it again and again and again. 'It's all very well us doing it once, but we have to keep backing it up. No disrespect, but if Dagenham & Redbridge beat Man United tomorrow, it doesn't mean they're good enough to play in the Premier League, they have to do it again and again. That has to be the long-term target for Wales.' The football references don't end there. Warburton is a keen follower of the game and he takes inspiration from two recent England players when it comes to putting loyalty at the heart of his career plan. Warburton says Wales need to beat teams like Australia on a regular basis at the highest level to be labelled a top side in the future . He decided to stay at Cardiff Blues, on a dual contract with the WRU, despite interest from France and he said: 'For me, there would be nothing more satisfying than staying at Cardiff and achieving success with the team I grew up watching. 'I have a lot of respect for someone like Steven Gerrard because he's been a one-club man. I would like to finish my career as a one-club man. 'I just quite like that idea. My football hero is Ledley King – everyone knows I'm a Tottenham fan – and he stayed at Spurs for his whole career. Those sort of guys are role models to me. That's why I have so much admiration for Brian O' Driscoll, because he stayed at Leinster and believed in them.' So far, the Blues revival has yet to ignite but for now, Warburton's focus has shifted to Test business, starting with the Wallabies on Saturday. He recognises that there would be a 'massive psychological boost' to be gained from beating opponents who will join the same onerous, three-way fight for qualification from World Cup, Pool A next year. Warburton hopes to end his career as a one-club man with Cardiff Blues - just like Steven Gerrard at Liverpool . There will be a major round-robin casualty. 'The fact is that a big side with the potential to reach a semi-final will go out at the pool stage,' said Warburton. 'It's exciting for the neutrals but from a Welsh, English and Australian perspective, it's a nightmare! The only advantage is that if you can get through that group, you will be battle-hardened going into the quarter-finals.' Before that time comes, Wales need to add their own extra layer of armour, in the form of at least one significant victory against the southern raiders. This will be a momentous month. Warburton is sick of talking about ending the drought – it's time for results, not rhetoric. Sam Warburton is an Ambassador for GUINNESS.

"Bournemouth's Capital One Cup hero - who scored a late winner to see the Cherries reach the quarter finals at the expense of West Brom - talks to Sportsmail about everything from his sporting heroes to who would play him in a movie of his life... Who is your sporting hero? Thierry Henry. I’d always watch him play and try to base my game around him. We’re similar in that he was very pacy. Callum Wilson (C) scores against West Brom to send Bournemouth into the Capital One Cup quarter finals . Wilson spent five years with Coventry before signing for Bournemouth in the summer . What would you be if you weren’t a sportsman? I like watching the renovation shows on television and wouldn’t mind smashing a kitchen out and fitting new ones. Which other sportsman would you like to be? LeBron James. He’s an unbelievable basketballer to watch. And he’s making a fair amount of money too! Career highlight? Scoring my first professional goal for Coventry. As a kid growing up in the city that’s something you dream about. Arsenal legend Thierry Henry is Wilson's sporting hero as they share a similar playing style . ... And the worst moment? Temporarily moving to Northampton’s ground Sixfields is up there. It wasn’t what any of us wanted but you’ve just got to get on with it. If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save? My mobile phone. Favourite karaoke song? I Believe I Can Fly by R Kelly. When I joined Bournemouth I sang it as my initiation. It went down well to be fair. Basketball superstar LeBron James is another of Wilson's sporting role models . Most-listened to song on your ipod? Lifestyle by a guy called Rich Homie — I’ve played that 1,000 times in a few weeks. Last film you saw? Paid in Full, an old-school film, on the way home from a game. Last book you read? I’m reading Bounce by Matthew Syed about sports psychology. I’m trying to get through it but it’s taking a while. I’m not the brightest spark. Wilson chose to sing R Kelly's I Believe I Can Fly as his initiation song at Bournemouth . Favourite pre-match meal? Chicken pasta before every game. Can you cook? Best dish? I can cook up a storm when I need to. Chicken, rice and peas — I’ve given it to my partner and her parents and they loved it. I was king for the day.

"Joe Launchbury has been ruled out for up to eight weeks with a neck injury, plunging England’s preparations for the autumn Tests at Twickenham into turmoil. The 23-year-old Wasps lock has been suffering from a persistent neck problem, caused by a nerve irritation, and England have reluctantly had to accept that he will miss the four-match series. Uncapped Leicester second row Graham Kitchener has been called into the squad to replace Launchbury, while Bath’s Dave Attwood is on course to start alongside Courtney Lawes against New Zealand on Saturday. England and Wasps lock Joe Launchbury has been ruled out of his country's entire autumn series . Launchbury, pictured in action for his club side Wasps, has picked up a neck injury . The loss of Launchbury was not the only setback ahead of England’s showdown with the world champions. Head coach Stuart Lancaster has also lost Northampton pair Luther Burrell and Stephen Myler with hand and hamstring injuries respectively. While the impressive form of Attwood is a consolation, the absence of Launchbury will be keenly felt. He has established himself as a stalwart of the pack while starting his country’s last 20 Tests. When England demolished the All Blacks 38-21 at Twickenham two years ago, the rookie lock was at the vanguard of the breakdown onslaught which paved the way for a historic win. Lancaster attempted to strike a philosophical note, saying: ‘It’s obviously disappointing but it’s important for Joe, England and Wasps that he has the appropriate rest and recovery period, and we are confident that he will be back in the New Year.’ Launchbury (left) in action catching the ball from a line-out in England's match against France in February . The absence of Launchbury (left) is a big blow to Stuart Lancaster's autumn plans . His injury has lengthened the casualty list among the front-five forwards. England must take on New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia in the coming weeks without Alex Corbisiero, Dan Cole, Tom Youngs, Mako Vunipola, Geoff Parling, Ed Slater and now Launchbury. The other area of primary concern is midfield, where Lancaster was already without the heavy-duty threat posed by Manu Tuilagi. Now he will be denied the imposing presence of Burrell, too. ‘Luther has seen the specialist and, while the news is positive that he could be available later in the series, he will stay with the Saints’ medical team this week,’ said the head coach. ‘We will look to bring him into camp further down the line.’ But Burrell is unlikely to come into selection contention until England face Samoa on November 22. Lancaster is preparing to go into the series opener with Brad Barritt of Saracens restored to the starting XV, in the less-familiar No 13 shirt, and Bath’s Kyle Eastmond at inside centre — as long as he can prove he has fully overcome a rib injury. Out wide, another of Bath’s turbo-charged back-line, Fijian-born Semesa Rokoduguni, is poised to make his England Test debut against the All Blacks.","England and Wasps lock Joe Launchbury has picked up a neck injury .

"Click here to read Matt Lawton's match report from Stamford Bridge . His assessment - that the atmosphere at Stamford Bridge ‘is getting worse’ - was brutal, but Jose Mourinho has a knack of hitting upon issues Chelsea fans want addressing. Despite sitting top and unbeaten, these supporters aren't all a merry bunch. Going to home games wasn't what it once was. The place is flat and the club don't seem sure how to fix the problems. To suggest this is down to apathy or complacency is lazy - there is more to it than that. Mourinho has clearly noticed it. ‘Playing here is like playing in an empty stadium,’ was his damning verdict after a relatively soulless afternoon in which the leaders picked up another three points in their pursuit of regaining the Premier League crown. Jose Mourinho was unhappy with the crowd as Chelsea fought their way past QPR at Stamford Bridge . A single Chelsea fan before the match - but Mourinho claimed the whole match felt like the stadium was empty . Eden Hazard scored his fifth penalty since January. Only Frank Lampard (six) has scored more for Chelsea in a Premier League calendar year . The dig wasn’t so thinly-veiled - the manager clearly stated he believes the Blues are the worst supported club at home in the division. Chelsea supporters are, quite rightly, insulted by that. But they also realise travelling to SW6 is intimidating because of the team Mourinho sends out and not a lot else. Pricing strategies and the way in which this club’s image has transformed since Roman Abramovich’s arrival are obvious contributive factors to a damp environment. The clientele is unrecognisable to those who witnessed a goalless draw against West Ham here 15 years ago this week. ‘I think it’s getting worse,’ Mourinho said, shaking his head. ‘When comparing to my previous time I think it’s getting worse. ‘I can clearly say we are the team to get less support in home matches. I don’t question the passion and the love - I’m nobody to question that and I know clearly that’s not true. ‘Chelsea fans show us their passion for this club every day, but there is a certain line of living (way of behaving) at the matches at Stamford Bridge.’ Mourinho definitely struck upon something there. Now a day at the Bridge has an almost West End feel to it. Those paying their extortionate amounts of money expect to be entertained in the same way a theatre lover would be in the evening. Eden Hazard scored the winning Chelsea goal from the penalty spot - his fifth since January . The issue of money is never far away. 'It's £50-plus to go,' said Chelsea Supporters' Trust chairman Tim Rolls. 'And young people - who are the most likely to sing and make noise - have been priced out of the game.' The most expensive adult ticket on general sale this weekend was £75, with the cheapest at £46. The BBC's recent Price of Football survey found that Chelsea's cheapest match-day ticket was the costliest in the country; only London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham sell season tickets that are more exorbitant than Abramovich's club. Chelsea supporters want this issue tackling. Mourinho refused to go into detail as to why he felt the atmosphere had subsided, but fans believe it can be rectified by new policies surrounding pricing, stewarding, singing sections and safe standing. ‘The team then starts playing like it’s a quiet, soft game at home,’ added Mourinho. The manager himself must, however, take on some of the blame. It was the Portuguese’s decision back in 2005 to move away fans from behind his dugout in the East Stand Lower to the Shed End. That divided the raucous section behind the goal and it’s never recovered. One disgruntled fan wrote an impassioned letter to John Terry on instagram on Sunday to relay his anger at Mourinho’s comments. The captain vowed to get back in touch with answers. Those at the club know what’s going on but appear powerless to stop it. And their team were flat on Saturday. It was the first time of a season that bares all the hallmarks of a procession to the title that they didn’t have it all their own way at home. Harry Redknapp’s QPR showed the sort of  steel they’ll need as we head into the new year; they were set up to stifle and did so admirably for large parts. Redknapp will also be pleased that Nedum Onuoha, Joey Barton and Jordon Mutch return to training this week and Charlie Austin continues to find the net. Hazard (left) and Oscar (right) scored a goal apiece to secure three points for Chelsea . But Mourinho was visibly agitated throughout. First he wasn’t happy with the lack of floodlights on a gloomy afternoon in west London, then his players were handed a dressing down at the break - despite leading. ‘At half-time he was not happy and told us we hadn't played well and had to do better, Willian said. ‘It was dangerous for us, to be only 1-0 up. So we had to improve. He was right because even then QPR came on to the pitch for the second half and scored their goal to get level. ‘But at least we reacted. We had to. We had to run more, keep the ball better, get at them more.’ Mourinho’s scathing attack on his own supporters may have been unwitting, but it’s amplified a growing unrest of a group whose lack of voice has drawn attention to their ongoing plight.","Chelsea beat QPR 2-1 in a hard-fought match at Stamford Bridge .

"Alan Irvine has refused to rethink his strategy of protecting fast-rising star Saido Berahino in the wake of West Brom's Capital One Cup capitulation at Bournemouth. The Albion boss defended making 10 changes to the side that scrambled a 2-2 Barclays Premier League draw with Crystal Palace on Saturday in spite of the 2-1 defeat at Dean Court three days later. Irvine left star striker Berahino, Stephane Sessegnon and Georgios Samaras on the bench on Tuesday night, and paid the price as Bournemouth booked their first-ever League Cup quarter-final. West Brom's Saido Berahino was left on the bench as West Brom were knocked out the Cup by Bournemouth . Baggies manager Alan Irvine defended his decision to rest Berahino despite the loss at Dean Court . The Baggies manager is determined not to overuse Berahino, especially through the hectic Christmas schedule, and risk leaving the 21-year-old physically and mentally spent come the new year. 'Saido's getting a lot of attention at the moment, he's being asked to do a lot as well,' said Irvine. 'They are away playing international games as well, and it's a big ask. 'I'm sure Albion fans would be bitterly disappointed if Saido Berahino were to be suddenly injured because we weren't looking after him. 'It's managing the whole situation, we have a squad of players who will need to be ready and will be used over the coming weeks. Berahino has stated the season in excellent form, scoring eight times for West Brom in 12 appearances . Berahino also played a vital part in England Under 21's qualification for next summer's European Championship . 'We've got an extremely busy period not too far from now, and must handle that very carefully. 'We went Monday and then Saturday, and then to ask them to go Tuesday and Saturday would have been a big ask.' England boss Roy Hodgson launched a long-running storm by revealing Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling had complained of tiredness during recent Euro 2016 qualifiers. Albion boss Irvine had no qualms admitting his own players have voiced troubles with top-flight schedules though, vowing not to put any of his squad at risk. West Brom take on Leicester at the King Power Stadium in a return to Premier League action on Saturday, with Irvine bound to recall all his big guns. Despite missing out on a League Cup quarter-final he insisted he had been right to change his line-up, criticising his fringe players for failing to play their way into his regular selection plans. Bournemouth's Callum Wilson (centre) scores the winning goal against West Brom at Dean Court . Eunan O'Kane celebrates scoring Bournemouth's opening goal after 49 minutes . 'I've had players coming to me and saying they were tired, and these are guys who want to play and want to win things,' said Irvine. 'They are right to say how they feel and they are right to raise it with me. 'When you have senior, committed and focused players telling you they are feeling the schedule, then you have to listen and respond. 'We will need to use all our squad over the coming weeks and months, and you need to have as many people fit and fresh as possible. 'Players had chances out there and some didn't take them, but we have to keep pushing on. 'When players come in and play well the squad looks like it has depth, but when they come in and don't play well it starts to look a bit thin. 'They are all capable, but some of them didn't show it at Bournemouth.'","Saido Berahino started on the bench as West Brom lost at Bournemouth .

"On an afternoon when Chelsea enjoyed an absurd amount of possession and again collected another three points in what appears a monopolistic title race, it’d be easy to overlook one man. He sits in front of John Terry and Gary Cahill with a sole purpose: to patrol the width of Stamford Bridge and not give an inch. Nemanja Matic performs this role so effectively that Jose Mourinho needn’t worry about teams travelling to west London in pursuit of catching the Blues cold.

Matic's heat map in midfield for Chelsea against Queens Park Rangers via Match Zone . Yes, Charlie Austin brilliantly equalised here with the sort of improvised flick only a poacher knows how, but the way in which Chelsea set up means they won’t drop many points in front of their own fans. Not many at all. Matic sits alongside Cesc Fabregas - who has now managed as many assists this campaign than Mesut Ozil registered in the entirety of last - and allows the Spaniard to flourish. There had been question marks in August as to how the pair work together. Fabregas is the sort of central midfielder insistent on hunting down causes - lost or otherwise. Therein lay a problem. Matic was also tasked with going and affecting the game higher up the pitch and Mourinho’s side were, on occasion, left bare. The manager spotted that quickly. The solution has been to afford Fabregas the chance to do his thing while Matic sits a little deeper. Matic pursues opposition midfielder Karl Henry of QPR (right) in the centre of the park .

He has flourished, again laying on for Oscar to score a sumptuous opener with the outside of his right foot against Queens Park Rangers. You’ll struggle to see a better goal up and down the country this weekend. That’s thanks in no small part to the Serbian, who is the master of retaining possession but also with the quickness of thought to notice runners around him. Graeme Souness said in a newspaper column last week that Matic is already better than Claude Makelele. That may be premature at this stage, but all the signs are that the 26-year-old come become just as important. After all, every title-winning side needs one. To just highlight his intelligence, Matic made sure he fouled the breaking Charlie Austin on halfway as we crept into stoppage time at 2-1. QPR looked dangerous, but the destroyer hauled Austin down. A crucial break in play ensued and the resulting free-kick came to nothing. There may be Fabregas, Eden Hazard, Diego Costa and Oscar ahead of him, but it’s the finer details to Matic’s game that may prove decisive in games much bigger than this.

"Jose Mourinho is master-minding another ‘15 or 20 years’ as one of the world’s top managers. The Chelsea manager is still only 51-years-old but is already one of the most decorated coaches to grace the game, having won titles in England, Italy, Spain and Portugal. His latest project, returning to Chelsea for a second spell, is beginning to bear fruit in its second season with the side already storming ahead at the top of the Barclays Premier League, leading their Champions League group, yet to be knocked out of a competition and unbeaten in 14 games. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is master-minding another ‘15 or 20 years’ as one of the world’s top managers . Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa clicked instantly but Mourinho insists his side isn't as good as that of 2005 . Mourinho said: ‘For me the situation is clear: I want to work, 15 or 20 more years. If, during this time, I do well enough to stay in a top level club, I will. 'If I don’t do well enough, and my market changes and I only have smaller clubs waiting for me, I will. Because I repeat, I want to work if I’m physically and mentally strong enough – which I expect to be – for another 15 to 20 years.’ The Portuguese claims that this team he has put together is still not comparable to the Chelsea side who he first won the title with back in 2005. According to Mourinho, his current team take more work than the side from a decade ago because the players are not yet finished products. Ivorian striker Didier Drogba (foreground) has flourished for Mourinho's Blues in recent weeks . ‘Back then it was a new team with almost all of them final products, top players,’ he added. ‘This team is giving me more work, if we can use that word, to bring them to that level. Because, end products are one thing and players with great talents are another thing.’ The next step in that process is facing Queens Park Rangers on Saturday. Chelsea will be boosted by the return of top-scorer Diego Costa to the side. The striker has not played since he aggravated his problematic hamstrings away on international duty with Spain. He has missed the past four games and Didier Drogba has flourished in his absence, scoring three goals in the last three matches.","Jose Mourinho is already one of the most decorated managers around .

"Click HERE to see more of our brilliant Match Zone, including Oscar's opening goal . An encounter that began in relative darkness left Jose Mourinho in one of his darker moods on Saturday. He might have seen his side strengthen their grip on this Barclays Premier League title race with a second-half penalty from Eden Hazard but Chelsea’s manager seemed far from satisfied when he eventually appeared for his post-match press conference. For a start, he accused the man in charge of the floodlights of being asleep, and he did have a point.

It was so gloomy Rob Green complained to the officials and when the lights did come on, 20 minutes into this absorbing contest, QPR’s goalkeeper was more than vindicated given the difference they made. It was like someone had just opened the curtains. But Mourinho said it was another 10 minutes or so, with the arrival of a quite brilliant goal from Oscar, before he realised ‘the ground was not empty’ and the point he was making was obvious. He was fighting against a sense of complacency that he clearly believes is spreading among the supporters, as well his players; this sense that the victories will simply come because they are so much better than everyone else. He seemed to regard Charlie Austin’s marvellous 62nd-minute equaliser as a product of that complacency, even if he did then praise his team for the manner in which they responded to take all three points. For the first half of this contest they were vastly superior to a QPR side who were only a single goal down because of the sheer defiance and determination of Green and his colleagues in defence, in particular the courageous Richard Dunne. Mourinho (below) would probably see criticism in any comparison with his first championship-winning Chelsea team but there were periods of this game, as there have been in other performances this season, when this side has looked like an improvement on its all-conquering predecessor. That first team was terrific. Powerful, as well potent, Sir Alex Ferguson marvelled at their machine-like consumption of consecutive Premier League titles. But there is something about this current crop of players that demands more attention, even if they are not delivering their best with the consistency their manager demands. They are certainly easier on the eye, while maintaining a ruthless quality that is enabling them to maintain this impressive unbeaten run. There is a nice blend of craft and hard graft, making them a real joy to watch. Oscar opened the scoring in the 32nd minute after an impressive passing move by Chelsea.

Filipe Luis congratulated his fellow countryman and Chelsea team-mate after Oscar scored past QPR goalkeeper Rob Green . Redknapp greets his opposite number Jose Mourinho before the encounter at Stamford Bridge . Cesc Fabregas now has as many assists this season as Mesut Ozil managed during the whole of last season . Clearly, the acquisition of Cesc Fabregas has made an enormous difference, his poise, precision and vision giving them something in midfield Chelsea could not even claim to have had when Frank Lampard was driving them towards trophy after trophy. But it is not just Fabregas. It is players with the flair and invention of Hazard, Willian and Oscar, as well as those with the power and strength of Diego Costa and a brilliantly drilled back four. Oscar’s goal was a combination of both qualities. It might have been the finesse of Fabregas that saw the ball delivered into the path of Oscar but it owed much to Costa’s strength to hold the ball up for what was a terrific one-two between the Spaniards. The finish that then followed from Oscar in the 32nd minute was just extraordinary, the Brazilian using the outside of his right foot to curl the ball across the face of the QPR goal and beyond the reach of a diving Green via the inside of the far post. The fact that Oscar also had to squeeze the ball in front of Dunne demanded even more precision. But it was the bend of the ball that was most staggering; a shot that almost challenged the laws of physics. QPR's Vargas brought down Chelsea playmaker Hazard to concede a second half penalty .

On Saturday's evidence, plenty. Having seen his side leak a late equaliser to Manchester United last Sunday, he was distinctly unimpressed to see a spirited QPR side battle their way back into this game. If Austin was once so in awe of John Terry he asked to have his picture taken with Chelsea’s captain, there were no signs of any enduring inferiority complex here. He produced a quite brilliant equaliser to add another chapter to the remarkable story of his rise from non-League to the Premier League, diverting Leroy Fer’s scuffed volley beyond the reach of Thibaut Courtois with a delightful heel-flick after the Chelsea goalkeeper had punched clear a cross from Eduardo Vargas. The vigour of Chelsea’s response did, however, please Mourinho. They moved up through the gears again and when Hazard burst into the QPR penalty area in the 75th minute, a reckless shoulder barge from Vargas left referee Mike Jones with little option but to point to the spot. Hazard, so composed in such situations, comfortably converted, and Mourinho noted with some pleasure the fact that Green then had to make another couple of decent saves. The Chelsea manager also praised opposite number Harry Redknapp for his ‘fantastic work’ in the way he had ‘organised his team defensively’. Such generosity did not extend to his players, though, even if the mark of a championship-winning team is the ability to secure victories when they fail to perform at their best. That said, there were also spells here on Saturday when they were absolutely mesmerising. Chelsea players pause for a minute's silence in respect for Remembrance Day .

"Andy Murray has come a long way over the past six weeks but the final frontier remains tantalisingly out of reach. There have been three ATP titles and some courageous wins but beating one of the world's very best players is still beyond him, as Novak Djokovic showed in dismissing him from the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters 7-5 6-2. Having competed on almost equal terms and even gone ahead in the second set, Murray completely unravelled without warning to lose 20 of the last 25 points and make it more likely that the Serb will hold off Roger Federer's challenge for the world No 1 ranking this year.

Murray hasnot beaten Djokovic this year, despite overcoming him in the final of his two Grand Slam wins . The Serbian is favourite to retain his world No 1 ranking at the end of the year . The British No 1 reacts after losing his serve to see Djokovic take the first set 7-5 . At the 02 Arena event – the draw for which will take place on Monday – you could see him beating anyone in the field but it looks a stretch against the world No 1. The impression is that Murray has to push all the way into the red line on the dial to compete with Djokovic right now, and he did that up until the unexpected denouement, when he collapsed from leading 2-1 with a break in the second. Coming in on an eleven-match winning streak he often got the better of the longer rallies but his erratic first serve made life difficult throughout the first set, and he had to fend off five break points before succumbing to the sixth at 5-6. With Djokovic getting increasingly agitated after missing three early break points in the second Murray broke for 2-1, only to concede his own serve straightaway. In fact it turned out to be the last game he won of the match, and he went behind 2-4 with a game of eyewatering ineptitude that included two double faults. But six weeks on the road, and the relentless pressure that Djokovic exerts, can do that to a man and the last fifteen minutes of this encounter should not be allowed to blight a fine effort since the US Open.

"Click here for all the facts and heat maps from the match at the Etihad Stadium . Marouane Fellaini was everyone's first or thereabouts on the list to leave Manchester United in the summer. How quickly football changes. Within a game-and-a-half, the Belgian midfielder was lauded as a huge player for Louis van Gaal. Some said he'd found his confidence, his brain and most importantly his power. Before the Manchester derby, Graeme Souness played down Fellaini's influence in the last fortnight, saying he sees plenty of power in the midfielder but not enough 'football'. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM MAILONLINE'S MATCH ZONE SERVICE . Marouane Fellaini was in the United starting XI again for the trip down the road to Manchester City . Fellaini has his head in his hands after missing a glorious chance late on at the Etihad . Fellaini's spread of influence was evident, but his performance wasn't spectacular in a dogged United display . After just two minutes, Fellaini's first touch was to pirouette away from James Milner under pressure and offload the ball, a figurative two fingers up to the former Liverpool midfielder. Click here to read former Manchester United manager David Moyes' thoughts on the Belgian midfielder, and the story of how he signed him.. twice! But Souness isn't necessarily wrong. Fellaini's key attribute is not his footballing ability and never has been. Breaking clear when United were on the ball in the opening stages, the visitors put two or three aerial deliveries into the corner of the penalty area for Fellaini and Robin van Persie to compete with. It's a 'way out' for United if little is on, and that is Van Gaal actively playing to Fellaini's strength in mid-air. Fellaini's aerial presence is one of his great qualities, with some doubting his footballing ability . Man City goalkeeper Joe Hart gets to the ball just ahead of Fellaini in the second-half at the Etihad . Fellaini won five tackles during the first half, two more than any player. But United's game plan changed soon after Chris Smalling's silly sending off. In the five minutes Fellaini replaced Smalling at centre-half before Michael Carrick arrived, he showed the good and bad of his game. A good tackle and interception in the middle of the park to release Van Persie was followed swiftly by an even better Manchester City penalty appeal after Fellaini kicked the back of Sergio Aguero's heel. The second-half started quieter for Fellaini, hardly on the ball and muscled out of a duel with man of the match Yaya Toure all too easily. United went behind and it was very much a case of the midfielder chasing shadows. Then, with 12 minutes remaining, Fellaini got in front of Kompany from a superb Angel di Maria centre. A huge chance to get an unexpected equaliser, the Belgian was way off target, the ball coming off his shoulder and trickling wide. Fellaini clumsily brings Sergio Aguero down in the penalty area with the Argentine moving away from goal . Referee Michael Oliver didn't give the penalty, but replays show Fellaini did catch Aguero . Fellaini reacted angrily to Aguero going down, shouting something in his ear after the incident . Jamie Redknapp also had his say on Fellaini before kick-off, the former midfielder stating he had had a 'good game-and-a-half', earning his place back in the side. An impressive second-half appearance against West Brom transformed the way United played, and his good show at home to Chelsea repaid Van Gaal's decision to start him. Two moments of play were key to his restoration to the starting line-up; his goal against West Brom and his header for Van Persie's equaliser against Chelsea. But behind those highlights were two effective performances, covering vast areas of the pitch. He ran a kilometre more than any other United man against Chelsea. He was top of the distance ran standings for both sides again on Sunday. On Sunday, Fellaini missed his chance to turn a decent showing into another headline-grabbing performance again.

"Nico Rosberg lit up the world title contest by putting himself on pole for the American Grand Prix, a race beset by what seems to be a fanciful threat of a boycott. The Circuit of the Americas was meant to suit championship leader Lewis Hamilton, but his Mercedes team-mate Rosberg was nearly four-tenths faster, giving the German hope of closing his 17-point deficit. It was Rosberg’s ninth pole of the season — against Hamilton’s seventh — yet the Brit has shown again and again this season how he can rise beyond his starting position with bravura race drives. Nico Rosberg (centre) will start in pole position ahead of Lewis Hamilton (left) and Valtteri Bottas (right) Rosberg (left) shakes hands with his Mercedes team-mate Hamilton after Saturday's qualifying . Mercedes' Rosberg speeds his way to claiming pole position in the United States Grand Prix in Austin . Rosberg was fastest in the second qualifying session before reinforcing his position in Q3 . World Championship leader Lewis Hamilton finished second in Q2 and Q3 at the Circuit of the Americas . ‘Great day,’ said Rosberg. ‘It was quite a challenge because the wind was changing. The weather was changing. The start will be important.’ Sitting next to him on the stage as he will on the grid was Hamilton, who had been fastest for most of the weekend. ‘I struggled with brake balance,’ he said. ‘It is potentially a problem in the race.’ The on-track action was a merciful relief amid a febrile paddock in which Force India, Lotus and Sauber postured about staging a boycott in protest at how little, as they see it, of the sport’s revenues they get. But can we take them seriously? It is doubtful in the extreme that they would defy Bernie Ecclestone in front of a TV audience of 350 million and a crowd of 100,000 in the most important marketplace in the sport. Ecclestone said: ‘Forget all that crap. I promise you they will be racing.’ Formula One has found it hard to crack America, especially after the 2005 boycott at Indianapolis over safety concerns left a lingering resentment among the public towards what they see as a distinctly European series. Hamilton rounds a bend at the Austin circuit where he struggled with his brake balance Saturday . Hamilton takes a 17-point lead ahead of Rosberg into Sunday's race in Texas .

It was put to Bob Fernley, of Force India, that not to race would be a further, perhaps fatal, blow to the sport in the States. He said: ‘That’s the last thing we want to do. There are three owners here who are passionate about racing, who have supported Formula One for many years in different formats. The last thing they want to do is damage it, but at the moment Formula One is damaging them big time.’ Part of their reasoning is valid: they deserve an equitable basic share of the sport’s revenue. Even Ecclestone admitted: ‘The problem is that there is too much money being distributed badly. That’s probably my fault. Frankly, I know what’s wrong but don’t know how to fix it.’ But the rebels would do well to remember that Formula One is about survival of the fittest; it is not the welfare state. There is something strange about millionaires, in some cases alleged billionaires, acting like beardy beggars. As with everyone else, they should operate within their means rather than spend money they have not got. That is one lesson to be taken from Marussia and Caterham, the two teams who went into administration between the last race in Russia and this one, whose plight is the catalyst for rebellion.

Jenson Button (left) will start in 12th after being handed a five-place penalty for changing his gearbox . Button finished a decent seventh on time but will have his work cut out chasing the 11 in front on Sunday . Fernley added: ‘The silence is deafening from people reaching out to help. It would be good for dialogue to start, for somebody to actually talk to us. We went through all the cost-control system with the FIA, but at the end of the day they couldn’t deliver it because they were out-voted by the Strategy Group [comprising McLaren, Red Bull, Mercedes, Ferrari, Williams, Lotus], and they know that. It is CVC [the equity firm that owns the sport] and the Strategy Group who are going to have to resolve it.’ Romain Grosjean of Lotus was the slowest of the 16 drivers, sitting out the action once the first session was over. Did he start the boycott early? Sebastian Vetted withdrew after going through the motions for two laps. The world champion took a sixth engine of the season, condemning him to start from the back of the grid, so he merely needed to get out there to qualify and that’s all he did, keeping the miles down and his power unit fresh.

"Host commentator . Thanks for following Sportsmail's live coverage of Lewis Hamilton's victory at the US Gran Prix. 24 points ahead with two races to go! See you next time... Hamilton: 'This is an incredible place. Huge thanks to the fans. We've got an incredible team. I'm really excited and it's such a privilege to represent my country here. ' So, we hear the National Anthem and Hamilton is presented with his well-earned trophy. It was the 32nd victory of Hamilton's career, making him the most successful Briton in F1 in terms of race wins, edging him ahead of 1992 champion Nigel Mansell. Hamilton also becomes the first non-German to win 10 races in a season, with Sebastian Vettel and Michael Schumacher both having won 11 and 13 apiece in past years. 'Get in there Lewis, get in there, mate,' shouts his engineer.  'Epic drive, mate, epic.' How it finished - 1.Hamilton, 2.Rosberg, 3.Ricciardo, 4.Massa, 5.Bottas, 6.Alonso, 7.Vettel, 8.Magnussen, 9.Maldonado, 10.Vergne. He's done it! Hamilton wins the US grand Prix to move further ahead of Mercedes team-mate Rosberg who follows him in second place. Hamilton stretches his Championship lead to 24 points. It's another Mercesed one-two as Ricciardo finishes in third. A brilliant race from the Australian, who had started in fifth on the grid. We're into the final stages and it looks as though Hamilton will break Nigel Mansell's record of 31 F1 wins. Button has been caught late on as Vettel surges through the field. He's in ninth place which is good going considering his terrible start. 2.4seconds is the gap between Hamilton and Rosberg, while Ricciardo continues to fight off Massa in third. Lap 50 - Massa hasn't given up on a podium position as he chases down Ricciardo. The Brazilian's team have just told him that they suspect Ricciardo has a problem. Maldonado almost touches Grosjean as he overtakes the Frenchman and heads into ninth. Rosberg reduces the gap behind Hamilton and the German is now just 1.9 seconds away. How they stand after lap 47 . 1. Ham 2. Ros 3. Ric 4. Mas 5. Bot 6. Vet 7. Alo 8. Mag 9. But 10. Mag . Lap 44 - Vettel takes Alonso to move up into sixth place. Alonso was ahead in the hairpin but the German got the better of him on the straight. Hulkenberg's reason for retirement was down to an engine failure. He told his team that he could smell oil and they told him to stop immediately. The Mercedes team tell Rosberg that he is 2.6seconds behind Hamilton, but his tyres are in good shape. Elsewhere, Ricciardo is now 1.8seconds clear of Massa in third. 1. Ham 2. Ros 3. Ric 4. Mas 5. Bot 6. Alo 7. Mal 8. Rai 9. Kvy 10. Mag . Rosberg isn't giving up yet - He's just recorded the fastest lap of the day - 1:42.38. Hamilton is currently 2.3secs ahead of Mercedes rival Rosberg. Ricciardo moves up once again as the Australian takes advantage of a pit stop from Massa. It's been a brilliant race from Ricciardo so far. He also records the fastest lap of the day - 1.42.8. Lap 29 - Alonso moves up to sixth as he continues his charge and overtakes Magnussen. Elsewhere, Grosjean and passed Vettel for ninth place. Vettel is having a torrid time - he's three pit stops in already. He's done it! The crowd, who seem to be behind Hamilton, go mad as the Brit manages to squeeze past Rosberg. Hamilton shot down the inside, forcing Rosberg to yield and give Hamilton the lead. Hamilton is getting closer and closer to Rosberg. Separated by just a couple of car lengths. The German seems to be struggling for one reason or another. Meanwhile, Alonso and Button continue their battle towards turn one. Definitely one to keep an eye on. Lap 21 - Rosberg's lead is getting cut by Hamilton and the Brit was four tenths of a second behind his team-mate on lap 20. Alonso and Button battle it out for 8th place. The Spaniard takes Button before the English driver regains the position as Alonso fails to take advantage of his original move. Here's a look at how they stand after the first batch of pit stops. 1. Ros 2. Ham 3. Mas 4. Ric 5. Bot 6. Kvy 7. Mag 8. But 9. Alo 10. Vet . Nico Hulkenberg is OUT as the Force India driver seems to have stopped just past the home straight. Strange one as there doesn't seem to have been any sort of collision... That's both Force India's out of the race. Ricciardo takes Bottas as his decision to pit works perfectly. The Australian moves up to seventh. Lap 16 - Hamilton has a poor 14th lap and is clearly struggling for grip as the Briton falls two seconds behind Rosberg. His seem to be suffering as his Mercedes team ask him for a grip update. Rosberg pits and gets the medium tyres on. Massa, in third, pits while Ricciardo follows closely behind. This could put Ricciardo ahead of Bottas. The Australian goes onto the medium tyre. 'Front left is finished', says Rosberg as it looks like the German will have to pit soon. This could play into Hamilton's hands, who looks to have more laps in his tyres. Hamilton has slipped out of the DRS zone, however. Is he struggling with his tyres as well? Hamilton is told he's safe on fuel and has started to put the pressure on Rosberg. He's closed in to within 0.8 seconds of the leader. Both Rosberg and Hamilton record their fastest laps of the afternoon so far as we enter lap 8. Vettel, who has already pitted twice, moved up from last place to 15th. Meanwhile, Hamilton is currently 1.1 seconds behind Rosberg. We're back underway at the end of lap 4 as the safety car leaves the track. Ricciardo makes up for a poor start with a brilliant move past Alonso to move up to fifth. Fantastic driving from the Australian. Adrian Sutil's race is over as the Sauber driver clashes with Perez. The safety car is out and as the replays are shown it's clear there can be no one to blame other than Perez. The Mexican shunted Sutil as he seemed to lose control on the corner. Lots of debris and damage to both cars. That's Perez and Sutil out of the race. And they're off! Rosberg gets away brilliantly but so does Hamilton. Bottas struggles to stay in third after pressure from Massa and Alonso. Massa takes Bottas to move up to third! Rosberg has established as good a lead as he could hope for at this early stage. We're just moments away from the lights go off here as the Circuit of the Americas welcomes a full house of race fans. Can Hamilton grabs his 32nd Formula One win to overtake Nigel Mansell? No doubt that record won't be in his mind as he concentrates solely on chasing down Rosberg in pole. Keanu Reeves and Pamela Anderson have just sauntered through the starting grid.

Hamilton tells Sky Sports: 'It's incredible (the atmosphere). We've got a great crowd here today. I'm hoping my breaks will be OK. I'm excited about actually doing some racing.' 'The priority is always for the team, but we obviously we want to finish ahead of each other.' Rosberg adds: 'The team come first but it's time to focus on myself a little bit. Our battle has always been aggressive and that's not going to change.' Before we get going, let's take a look at where we stand the the Drivers' Championship. As we've mentioned, Hamilton leads, but only by 17 points. It's a big day for his closest challenger Rosberg.

"It was a momentous day celebrating 60 years since the Queen's Coronation. And today, the monarch, resplendent in a pale gold silk coat and dress with beautiful flower-trimmed hat, was dressed to befit the occasion. Wearing a pale gold coat of a delicate silk brocade, she added a flash of colour at the lapel with an eye-wateringly large aquamarine brooch from the Brazil Parure collection of jewels. Her hat was trimmed on the underside of the brim with a clutch of five silk chiffon blooms in a complementary pale blue tone. Scroll down for video . Blooming!

Picture . of health: The Duke of Edinburgh, who has recently suffered ill health, . looked well as he arrived at the Abbey this morning . National figures gathered at Westminster Abbey ahead of the Queen's 11am arrival for the service celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Queen's coronation. It was a day to reflect and remember, with a thanksgiving service designed to echo the original Coronation service held within these same ancient walls on 2 June 1953. Today the monarch marked the milestone with her family, 2,000 invited guests and the nation. The Duke of Edinburgh missed a royal engagement with the Queen on Monday night because he was feeling 'under the weather', but was well enough to attend the service today. The service has been divided into the Recognition, Anointing, Homage and Thanksgiving, reflecting parts of the original Coronation ceremony. The Queen arrives with Prince Philip at Westminster  coronation on Tuesday to mark a reign that has weathered six decades of social transformation and the end of her country's global empire.

The majestic St Edward's Crown - with which the Queen was crowned - will rest on the High Altar - the first time the heavy, solid gold, jewel encrusted crown has left the Tower of London since the 1953 coronation. The Ampulla, the gold, eagle shaped bottle from which the holy oil was poured for the anointing - the most sacred part of the coronation - also stood on the altar. The Coronation chair from 1953 had been restored to its former glory for the occasion. Landmark: The Dean of the Abbey said this was to be a happy occasion, but the service was nevertheless a solemn affair . Solemn: The senior royals heard a speech by PM David Cameron and enjoyed music from some of the choristors who performed at the original Coronation .

A flask of aromatic oil - taken from the same batch made for the Queen's coronation - was processed through the Abbey, carried by 11 representatives of the people of the United Kingdom to the Sacrarium, received by the Archbishop of Canterbury and placed by the Dean of Westminster on the High Altar. Prime Minister David Cameron gave a reading, as will the Secretary General of the Commonwealth Kamalesh Sharma. Actress Claire Skinner, who stars in the BBC sitcom Outnumbered, read a poem written for the anniversary by the Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy. One of her favourites: The Queen wore a large aquamarine brooch from the Brazil Parure collection . The Brazil Parure collection, presented to the Queen in 1953 by the President and people of Brazil, is one of the most modern in the Queen's extensive collection. The set consists of a necklace with nine large aquamarine stones - one of which is a pendant that the Queen had embellished with yet more diamonds and made detachable so that she could wear it as a brooch, as she chose to do today. The large aquamarine stone, which the Queen has worn as a brooch on many occasions, is matched to a bracelet set with large aquamarines in the same tone. It took over a year for jewellers of Brazil to collect enough stones of the correct size and hue to make the set. It is said that the Queen adored the set so much that in 1957 she commissioned royal jewellers Garrard & Co to make her a tiara made to match with three vertically set oblong aquamarines. As well as wearing the brooch as a separate piece - the Queen wore it on the lapel of a blue coat for Ascot recently - she frequently wears the entire set together, making for a dazzling display. One memorable occasion was in 2006, when the Queen hosted the President of Brazil and his wife at a state banquet at Buckingham Palace - and honoured the President by wearing the spectacular jewels his country had bestowed upon her some 53 years earlier.

"Sussex have snapped up England Lions paceman Tymal Mills following his departure from Essex. The 22-year-old left-arm seamer has signed a two-year contract at Hove, with Sussex claiming to have beaten a number of rivals to his signature. Mills rejected a new offer from Essex after suffering an injury-plagued 2014 in which he played in only 12 games. Tymal Mills' raw pace and undoubted potential has led to a battle for his signature, which Sussex have won . The left-armer is capable of bowling at over 90mph, and will hope to develop his game at Sussex . However, his potential is clear thanks to deliveries which can top 90mph, and he left Essex after taking 76 wickets in 59 first-team matches. 'I'm really pleased to be on board,' Mills said of his move. 'As soon as Sussex came in for me, I knew it was a county that I wanted to join. I'm really glad it is all finalised. 'The injuries look to be behind me now and I'm really looking forward to moving down here, getting stuck in this winter and going strong next year.' The former Essex bowler's pace and form earned him an England Lions call-up earlier this year . Mills, who toured Sri Lanka with the Lions in February, also spent time with the senior England side last winter ahead of the Ashes tour to give England's batsmen practice against left-arm pace bowling. Sussex's professional cricket manager Mark Robinson, who has worked with Mills in his role with the Lions, said: 'We're hugely excited by the arrival of Tymal. 'He's a player of enormous potential who is blessed with great pace and a true fast bowler's frame, and we can't wait to see him bowl next season.'","Sussex claim Tymal Mills' signature ahead of several other counties .

"If and when Leicestershire finally win a game of four-day cricket, there will be no bunting, no champagne and definitely no complacency. So says Wasim Khan, who in January will become the club’s new chief executive after nine years in charge of the Cricket Foundation charity. Let no one accuse him of taking the easy option. You have to go back to September 2012 for the last time Leicestershire won a match in the County Championship – a tense two-wicket triumph over Gloucestershire which spared them a third wooden spoon in four years. Wasim Khan, posing with his trophy during the Asian Cricket Awards at Lord's earlier this month (left) and with his MBE last year, is the new chief executive of Leicestershire . Wasim Khan is made an MBE by the Queen . What a heady memory that seems now. In the past two summers Leicestershire have played 32 Championship winless matches, becoming the first team since Northamptonshire in the 1930s to go through successive seasons without a single victory. The unkind view is that Khan will be able to use the latest batch of spoons to mix the poison in the chalice. But Leicestershire need not be a laughing-stock: as recently as the late 1990s, they were one of the best teams in the country, and they have won three Twenty20 Cups – more than anyone. Equally, Khan has not risen to the heights of chief executive at the relatively tender age of 43 without suggesting he has something about him. When he first broke into the highly successful Warwickshire side of the mid-1990s, averaging 46 in a team that included Nick Knight, Dermot Reeve, Ashley Giles and Allan Donald, he did so as the first British-born Asian cricketer to play for a county. Now, he is the first non-white county chief executive, and there are many within the game who believe he can go all the way. Regardless of what happens next, he has already proved himself capable of defying expectation. And he has not set the bar low. ‘I see three main elements to my job,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘We have to make Leicestershire more sustainable financially. We have to do a lot more to establish an emotional connect with the local community, which hasn’t always happened before. And we need to improve standards on the field. Poor performances are not acceptable.’ Leicestershire has developed an unfortunate reputation as a feeder club for more prosperous rivals, particularly Nottinghamshire, who over the past few years have gobbled up the likes of Stuart Broad, James Taylor and Harry Gurney. In recent weeks, others have followed suit: Josh Cobb (to Northamptonshire), Nathan Buck (Lancashire) and Shiv Thakor (Derbyshire). Khan (right) in his previous role of chief executive of the Cricket Foundation, with Lord's Taverners CEO Paul Robin (left) and Professional Cricketers' Association chief Angus Porter .

Post cricket . CEO Cricket Foundation (2005-13) Leicestershire CEO (2014-) But Khan believes the process can be reversed – to the extent of turning Leicestershire into the leading county outside the Test venues within five years. ‘It’s massively ambitious,’ he admits. ‘But why not? ‘If we become more commercially viable – through increasing our membership, hosting more events and encouraging people to use our facilities – then we can attract better players. There are passionate people at the club who don’t want to settle for mediocrity. My job is to galvanise them and create the right environment for success.’ The former Australian Test all-rounder Andrew McDonald is set to take over as coach, while the highly regarded Australian seamer Clint McKay has joined the club for 2015. There is also talk of signing Australian batsman Mark Cosgrove. One way or another, there will be little shortage of Aussie grit. Khan, pictured as a player for Warwickshire in 1996, is now CEO st struggling Leicestershire (right) A different demographic, however, could prove more crucial to Leicestershire’s long-term success – not to mention the club’s viability as one of 18 first-class counties who receive money each year from the ECB to sustain them. Leicester was one of the first towns in the UK in which the non-white community became the majority, and Khan regards it as his job to find out why more of the large south Asian population has not been snapped up by the cricket team. ‘We have to create an emotional connection with them,’ he says. ‘Lots of county age-group sides all round the country contain a high percentage of non-white players, yet there is a relatively low percentage of them in first-class cricket. There is clearly some blockage somewhere, and that is not specific to Leicestershire. Wasim Khan (middle row, third left) in Warwickshire's 1996 team photo with Ashley Giles (back centre) and Co . ‘But hopefully, as someone who grew up within that community if you like, I can help break those down. When you speak to the south Asian community, the message is that they don’t feel welcome, that Leicestershire is not their club. There has been some truth in that, but it to be a two-way process. It can’t all be take, take, take. ‘I want to get into Leicester and find out what exactly the issues have been. Hopefully they might look at me and think that there is an opportunity in cricket for British-born Asians.’ It is an area in which Leicestershire have the potential to lead the way. If Khan gets it right, the whole of English cricket will be in his debt.","Leicestershire have not won a Championship match for two years .

"Jonathan Trott has been named in an England Lions squad to tour South Africa in January as he takes his first tentative steps back into Test cricket. The 33-year-old batsman who came home from last winter's Ashes tour after suffering a stress related illness has not played international cricket since. But his success with Warwickshire, where he scored three centuries in the last month of the season, has encouraged him and the ECB to believe he is capable of touring again. Jonathan Trott is expected to be named in an England Lions squad to tour South Africa in January . First-class squad to face South Africa A . Jonny Bairstow (Yorkshire), Gary Ballance (Yorkshire), Sam Billings (Kent), Jack Brooks (Yorkshire), Alex Lees (Yorkshire), Adam Lyth (Yorkshire), Craig Overton (Somerset), Liam Plunkett (Yorkshire), Boyd Rankin (Warwickshire), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Adam Riley (Kent), Sam Robson (Middlesex), Jonathan Trott (Warwickshire), James Vince (Hampshire).

He tweeted: 'Delighted to be included in Lions trip and looking forward to being part of the England set up again.' England selector James Whitaker said: 'Jonathan Trott’s exceptional form and run scoring exploits for Warwickshire at the end of the summer has resulted in his selection for the First Class fixtures at the beginning of the tour. Congratulations to him and to all of the players selected.' Trott signed a new three-year contract with Warwickshire last Thursday after enjoying a revival in form. He made a delayed start to the campaign after a recurrence of the illness in April, but found form quickly after making his return for his county. 'Warwickshire CCC is a very special club for me and my family and I would like to thank everyone associated with the club for their support,' said Trott.

"South Africa have returned to the top of the Reliance ICC ODI Team Rankings for the first time in five years. The Proteas' 72-run victory in their second ODI against New Zealand on Friday was enough to see them reclaim top spot, despite the third and final ODI being washed out on Monday. South Africa were one point behind Australia in the rankings before the series in New Zealand and they have now done enough to move in front. Hamish Amla (left) celebrates reaching his century as Imran Tahair (right) takes the wicket of Tim Southee against New Zealand on Friday . The last time South Africa topped the list was in September 2009, but their first-round elimination from the ICC Champions Trophy that year saw Australia overtake them. There was further good news for the Proteas in the Reliance ICC ODI Player Rankings, with one-day skipper AB de Villiers and Hashim Amla occupying the top two places in the batting table after the 2-0 series win in New Zealand.

"By the standards of what has been a year of extremes, the past week has been among the better ones for Jonathan Trott. First a new contract with Warwickshire and now a call-up to tour this winter with the England Lions. ‘Back in May, as you know, my only focus was playing second-team cricket,’ he told me on Tuesday. ‘It just shows how quickly things can change in sport.’ Trott was buzzing and understandably so. But not because he sees a tour of South Africa as an opportunity to secure a spot for next year’s Ashes. ‘One step at a time,’ he insisted cheerfully. Jonathan Trott has been named in the England Lions squad to tour South Africa in January and February . The players travelling to South Africa with Trott and their schedule for the January-February tour . No, what matters more to Trott right now is the fact that people still believe in him; that his country, as well as his county, think he has a future in the game after the difficulties he endured with a stress-related illness that forced him to leave the last Ashes tour. ‘At 33 it would have been easy for the ECB to simply discard me,’ he said. ‘But they’ve been very supportive all along and I appreciate being given this chance. 'It’s been the same with Warwickshire. I had a year left on my contract and they’ve given me another three. I have to say I was really pleased they had that confidence with regard to my future.’ Trott earned his selection with some outstanding performances for Warwickshire towards the end of the summer. He joined the other England players two weeks ago for a screening session at Loughborough and then met with England selector James Whitaker and Warwickshire boss Dougie Brown last week. Trott spoke with Sportsmail's Matt Lawton at his home in Birmingham - the batsman is excited about his return to the England fold via the Lions in South Africa but insists he is keen to keep his Ashes ambitions in check . By the end of that process the ECB were only too happy to welcome Trott back into the fold, with Whitaker on Tuesday citing his ‘exceptional form and run-scoring exploits for Warwickshire’. ‘I wasn’t playing thinking about an England recall,’ said Trott, who was relaxing at home with his family. ‘After taking that second break from the game in April my only focus was just playing for Warwickshire. ‘But it feels just like it did in 07/08 when I was called into the Lions. I did two tours back then and it aided my development hugely. I spent six weeks in three-star hotels in India but that’s how you earn your stripes.’ Trott's England Lions call-up follows his securing of a contract extension with county side Warwickshire . Trott has been named in the provisional 14-man squad that will play two first-class matches against South Africa in January, but will not feature in the five one-day matches that follow. That has led to speculation that he is being considered more for the Test side and possibly the Ashes. Trott, however, urges a bit of caution there. ‘With regards to the one-dayers, because I’ve not been around the set-up for a while I guess I wouldn’t be looked at as someone they could bring in for the World Cup if there was an injury,’ he says. ‘That’s my reading of that one. And I don’t see this particularly as me being on the comeback trail. Everyone who is involved with the Lions will want to play for England and I’ll be no different. ‘Of course I’d like to play in the Ashes. But I also know I’ll have to be in good form to earn that right, and even then the decision still rests with the selectors. ‘Let’s just see how I go. There is no point in setting those goals at the moment. It’s just a case of taking one step at a time. If you think where I was in May, my only focus was on playing second-team cricket again. It’s really important not to get too far ahead and I hope everyone, you guys included, can do the same. I’m just very happy to be where I am right now; looking forward to three more years with Warwickshire and a tour with the Lions.’ Six months ago, as he revealed in a moving interview with this newspaper last month, Trott was in a much darker place. He would go to bed not wanting the night to end, so much did he dread returning to work at Edgbaston the following day. Trott admits he has come a long way in recent months: 'It just shows how quickly things can change in sport’ On Tuesday he was cracking jokes; full of enthusiasm, excited. Such is his modesty, however, he was actually a little stunned by all the fuss over his recall. ‘Is it a slow news day or something?’ he said teasingly. ‘All it will take is Mourinho to say something or Kevin (Pietersen) to tweet something. You see, I’ll be back off the news agenda soon enough.’ It would probably be unwise for him to one day pursue a career as a news editor but in his own mind it would also be a mistake to put too much emphasis on his international recall. It is not the stuff of dreams in his view. ‘It was a dream when I played my first Test for England,’ he said. ‘But, as I’ve said, I don’t really even want to think about the Ashes at this stage. Trott's selection follows a number of impressive performances for Warwickshire this season . ‘I’m really looking forward to going to South Africa. I love touring and I’m looking forward to playing in Soweto. I’ve not played there before. And I’ll go in with my eyes open, just like I did seven years ago. There will be some training before Christmas but I’ll do some training with Warwickshire before then to make sure I’m ready.’ He will also continue to consult with Dr Steve Peters, the leading sports psychiatrist who has played such an important role in Trott’s return to top-level cricket. Peters told him he was suffering from ‘situational anxiety’, with Trott relieved to have found someone who finally understood the difficulties he was enduring. With a far more positive outlook, Trott is also now able to maintain his keen interest in other sports. Last week he took a close friend from the Warwickshire backroom staff to watch the American football at Wembley. Next week he hopes to see Liverpool play against Real Madrid at The Bernabeu. For a man who only a few months ago wasn’t sure if he wanted to play cricket any more, life would appear to be good. November 25, 2013: The ECB announces Trott has left the Ashes tour of Australia with a stress-related illness. March 6, 2014: After a lengthy absence, including missing Warwickshire’s pre-season tour of Barbados, Trott confirms he will return in the pre-season match the following month against Gloucestershire. March 14, 2014: Speaks publicly for the first time and denies he was suffering from depression. Trott stated he was ‘burnt out’ following the first Ashes Test. The comments attracts the ire of former captain Michael Vaughan, who says that he feels ‘conned’ by Trott’s version of events. April 1, 2014: Can only muster four runs off 19 balls in his comeback innings at Edgbaston against Gloucestershire. April 8, 2014: Makes eight from 22 balls against Oxford MCCU in a friendly as he struggles for form. Trott also plays in the opening LV= County Championship match against Sussex, scoring 37 and 26. April 18, 2014: Steps away from cricket for a second time due to a recurrence of stress-related illness. May 16, 2014: Returns to training with Warwickshire. June 19, 2014: Makes his comeback in the Birmingham Bears’ NatWest T20 Blast win against Northamptonshire, where he makes one off seven balls. June 29, 2014: Returns to championship action at home to Nottinghamshire and contributes 23 and 19 in the Bears’ three-wicket win. July 23, 2014: Follows up his first 50 of the season against Durham at Chester-le-Street by cracking first ton with 106 against Sussex at Horsham. July 31, 2014: Scores another century in Royal London One-Day Cup match against Durham at Gosforth. September 20, 2014: Registers two off 15 balls in loss to Durham in the Royal London One-Day Cup final at Lord’s. Trott still finishes as the second highest run-scorer in the tournament with 488 in 10 innings at an average of more than 50. He ends the season having scored 1,156 runs across all three formats.

"It is dilapidated, dark and not even deceptively spacious - measuring just 11ft by 7ft. But a one-car garage off the King's Road in Chelsea, central London, is set to become the most expensive in the UK - by selling for more than £550,000. Tucked at the end of an alleyway behind a row of terraced houses, the outbuilding is described as being on an 'irregular shaped, broadly level site' which extends to  538 sq ft, or just 0.013 acres. Despite the size and awkward location, the Lamont Road garage is set to attract interest from investors after planning permission was granted for it to be converted into an unusual home. Scroll down for video . The garage, measuring just 11ft by 7ft, is set to become the most expensive in the UK when it goes up for auction in two weeks . It is now going to auction with an incredible guide price of around £500,000 to £550,000 - which would make it the most expensive garage ever sold in the UK. This is twice the average value of a home in the UK and three times the average price paid for a property in England and Wales last month. On top of the price, the buyer would then have to pay £700 + VAT in auction house fees as well as four per cent stamp duty before beginning the conversion. Planning permission was granted last year for the garage to be demolished, and replaced with a single storey plus basement dwelling. It is tucked at the end of an alleyway between Lamont Road and the King's Road in Chelsea, one of London's most desirable areas . The outbuilding is described as being on an 'irregular shaped, broadly level site' which extends to 538 sq ft, or just 0.013 acres . When completed, it will have two bedrooms, one with en-suite, living room, kitchen/ diner, toilet, guest shower room and patio. The garage will be sold on October 30 at Allsop's auction in The Cumberland Hotel near Marble Arch. It could be the latest outrageous price paid in London for a garage or small area of space as the capital deals with its housing crisis. The garage will be sold to potential developers on October 30 at Allsop's auction in The Cumberland Hotel near Marble Arch . Planning permission was granted last year for the garage to be demolished, and replaced with a single storey plus basement dwelling . A row of three garages in Wandsworth were sold for £500,000 in July while six garages in Parsons Green sold for £700,000 in May. Also in May, a courtyard garden in Chelsea which had no planning permission was sold for £84,000. The price guide for the Chelsea garage is only slightly less than Category A listed Galloway House, Dumfries and Galloway, which boasts  36 bedrooms, 20 acres of land and will go on the market for £595,000. Gary Murphy, an auctioneer at Allsop, said: 'This could be the highest price paid for a single garage in the capital, but then again it does have planning permission for a house. 'And what a great opportunity to build your own home just off Chelsea's, King's Road - one of the most desirable locations in London.' When completed, it will have two bedrooms, one with en-suite, living room, kitchen/ diner, toilet, guest shower room and patio .

It could be the latest outrageous price paid in London for a garage or small area of space as the capital deals with its housing crisis .

Zoopla, the property website, says the average house price on Lamont Road next to the garage, is now £3.5 million - up £507,000 on the past 12 months and £1.1 million in the past five years. A report from National Housing Federation, also released this week, claim only Londoners earning more than £100,000 can afford a typical mortgage. A row of three garages in Wandsworth were sold for £500,000 in July, even though they came without planning permission . This garage located near the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's home at Kensington Palace was put up for sale for £500,000 . This is more than three times the average salary. When told about the garage, Dave Smith, external affairs manager for London at the NHF, reiterated the need to combat the crisis. He said: 'The effects of London's housing crisis are being felt by millions of hard working people every day and action must be taken now to tackle the capital's out of control housing costs. 'We urgently need an ambitious, long term plan and for politicians from all sides to commit to ending the housing crisis within a generation.' With 36 bedrooms, 20 acres of land and stunning views out to the Irish Sea, Galloway House in Sorbie, Dumfries and Galloway, will go on the market for just £595,000 – only slightly more than the garage in Chelsea . This four-bedroom property in Skipton, North Yorkshire, is now on the market for £500,000, significantly less than the garage in Chelsea . With a budget of £550,000 you could also buy this sprawling four-bedroom detached house in Dunfermline, Fife .","Dilapidated garage is set to become the most expensive in the UK when it goes up for auction with a guide of £500,000 .
Measuring just 11ft by 7ft, the outbuilding is tucked behind the King's Road in Chelsea, prime location in London .
The ramshackle shed is on an 'irregular shaped, broadly level site' which extends to 538 sq ft, or just 0.013 acres .
Planning permission was granted last year for the garage to be replaced with a single storey plus basement dwelling ."

"Click here for Martin Samuel's match report from Old Trafford . Search through the thousands of pages written about Louis van Gaal over the years and you won't find much about the value of running and jumping. Manchester United's manager has always preferred to talk about rather sophisticated facets of the game. As he reflects on perhaps the first significant result of his time at Old Trafford, though, Van Gaal and his sports science team will have noticed the remarkable numbers attached to Marouane Fellaini's stand-out performance against Chelsea on Sunday. Fellaini is never going to be invisible. Not when he looks like he does. Nevertheless anyone who left Old Trafford on Sunday sensing that the big Belgian had been 'everywhere' will be interested to know that he pretty much was. Marouane Fellaini put in one of his best performances for Manchester United against Chelsea . The Belgian midfielder was signed by former manager David Moyes for £27.5million last summer . Fellaini's touch map against Chelsea on Sunday . According to the statistics, Fellaini covered 12.17km during the course of the game, almost a kilometre more than United's Daley Blind, the man next in the list. More significantly, Fellaini also completed 70 sprints, a remarkable number for a holding midfield player and more than two United full backs encouraged by their coach to overlap. Numbers can be over-used and over-analysed in football. Some may say that the only statistic that really matters from Sunday's engrossing clash was the 1-1 scoreline. Nevertheless, Fellaini's efforts say everything for his return to physical fitness after a difficult first year at United and go some way to indicate just why Chelsea's primary playmaker had such a relatively minimal impact on this game. Clearly designated to shadow Cesc Fabregas, Fellaini ensured that the Spain midfielder made only three passes in the first 20 minutes and eleven in the whole of the first half. Prior to the game, Fabregas was the most successful and regular passer of a football in the Barclays Premier League. 'He was fantastic,' said Robin van Persie of Fellaini. 'He did a great job on Fabregas for us. 'It was incredibly helpful when you are trying to stay in a game.' Fellaini endured an awful first season at United. Fellaini (left, pictured on Sunday) compared to a look of despair away at Real Sociedad in 2013 . Fellaini (close to Toni Kroos against Bayern Munich in April) went missing in the big games last season . He failed to produce the sort of performances for United that had made him famous at Everton previously . Alexander Buttner (left), Fellaini and Shinji Kagawa (right) weren't deemed 'United players' in the summer . Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero comfortably skips past Fellaini at the Etihad Stadium . The foreign press gave Fellaini no score when United lost to Bayern Munich in the Champions League . David Moyes' big summer signing of 2013, unfortunately for him he became rather synonymous with the former United manager's difficult time at Old Trafford. In the summer, Van Gaal suggested to the club's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward that Fellaini be sold. 'He is not a United type of player,' Van Gaal told Woodward. Had injury not intervened, Fellaini would probably be playing his football on loan at Napoli right now. He may never have been seen again in a United shirt. With some belated and overdue fitness, however, has arrived something of the player we used to see at Everton. Fellaini was always technically good enough but it was the energy and physicality of his football that stood out during his time on Merseyside, as well as his habit of scoring important goals. Last season at Old Trafford the Belgian looked desperately short of confidence. It must be said, he rarely looked of the required standard. Moyes perhaps didn't help by talking of the 'best chest trap I have ever seen' - faint praise, that - but with hindsight maybe it was the debilitating effect of a succession of injuries that prevented Fellaini from reaching the levels of fitness required to play his natural game. After the draw at West Brom, Van Gaal conceded that he may have to adapt his own philosophy a little as he continues to learn about English football. 'We have to look also for physical talents and maybe that's our problem,' said Van Gaal in explaining his decision to leave out Ander Herrera. 'I'm a coach who is always thinking about creative players but in England you also need physical bodies in your team and Fellaini is one of these.' Fellaini is perhaps slightly more than that but the fact is he may not have played on Sunday had others been available yet the way that United conceded a goal to Chelsea from a set-piece showed just how valuable the 26-year-old may prove to be. United are not a particularly tall side, especially when players like Michael Carrick and Darren Fletcher are not in it. If you look at the physical attributes of Chelsea and Manchester City, for example, that certainly becomes clear. Robin van Persie wheels away after thundering home Fellaini's parried header equaliser against Chelsea . Fellaini scored a super goal breaking from midfield away at West Bromwich Albion on Monday night . Fellaini has Chelsea defender Gary Cahill turning the wrong way during the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford on Sunday . Louis van Gaal has conceded he may need to change his methods as manager of Manchester United . Fellaini brings muscle and aerial threat at both ends of the field. Van Persie may have scored the equaliser  but it was Fellaini's header from a set-piece that served as the vital assist. Former United captain Gary Neville said: 'For 25 years, Manchester United as an option, not as a rule, would lump the ball forward. There's no doubt. 'People say it's not the Manchester United way, but I don't get that. 'So Fellaini could come in handy. Carrick is 6ft 1in and there might be an option there. 'You've got to think about those things going into a game and I'm sure Louis van Gaal will this season.'","Marouane Fellaini was superb for Manchester United against Chelsea .

"A police officer who almost died when a fleeing burglar crushed him with his getaway car has returned to work. Pc Pete McGinn suffered devastating injuries while tackling criminal Carl Anderson, 51, who 'used the car as a weapon' against the police officer, on June 7 last year. He was pinned against a lamppost as he clung to the door of the blue Honda Stream as Anderson fled, leaving the 45-year-old lying in the road in Erdington, Birmingham with horrific fractures to his legs and pelvis. Scroll down for video . PC Pete McGinn suffered devastating injuries while tackling criminal Carl Anderson, 51, who 'used his getaway car as a weapon' against the police officer. But, against the odds, he has now returned to work . He was pinned against a lamppost as he clung to the door of the blue Honda Stream while Anderson fled, leaving the 45-year-old lying in the road in Erdington, Birmingham with horrific fractures to his legs and pelvis . Dramatic footage taken on a mobile phone shows Anderson desperately wrestling with Pc McGinn as another police van tries to ram the car off the road. Fearing the worst he even asked colleagues to tell his family he loved them as they administered first aid. They called for medics who rushed him into a six hour operation to pin his broken body together. This week he returned to work as part of an investigation team based at Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. The constable, who has served with West Midlands Police since 2002, has also been given a bravery award to commend his heroic actions. He said: 'I was starting to go stir crazy at home, not to mention driving my wife mad. 'I'm only doing three hours a day at the moment and juggling shifts around hospital appointments and physio, but it's just great to be back. Anderson, from Aston, Birmingham, was jailed for 12 years in September last year at Birmingham Crown Court . 'I've got another major operation pencilled in for later this year so I'm preparing for another extended period of rehab. 'I'd always said I wanted to return to front-line policing but in light of the injury I'm looking at moving into a detective role, and hopefully next year I can return full-time. 'It's a great honour, but every officer at that awards ceremony will tell you the same: that they were just doing their job. 'People sign-up as police officers knowing they are likely to get into potentially dangerous situations in order to protect the public, that's what I did and what I'm determined to do for the rest of my police career.' Anderson, from Aston, Birmingham, was jailed for 12 years in September last year at Birmingham Crown Court. He pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent, burglary, dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, and driving without insurance. The court was told he used the car 'as a weapon' slamming it into reverse and pinning the helpless officer between the passenger door and the metal pole. He went the wrong way around a roundabout at 70mph before forcing another police car to swerve to avoid a head-on collision. He abandoned the car near the scene but was arrested at his home later the same day. Immediately after the crash surgeons inserted pins and plates into Pc McGinn's left leg and hip and transferred an artificial ligament into his shattered knee. Months later he underwent another gruelling 'nerve transfer' operation to try and bring back the feeling. He faces going under the knife once again to replace the tendons in his cruciate ligament and has lost all feeling in his right foot. Dramatic footage taken on a mobile phone shows Anderson desperately wrestling with Pc McGinn as another police van tries to ram the car off the road . Fearing the worst after the accident, PC McGinn (pictured outside court) asked colleagues administering first aid to tell his family he loved them . Pc McGinn  has now returned to work.

"Erik Lamela loves a 'rabona' goal. In fact, the Tottenham midfielder has been doing it for years. Long before the 22-year-old moved to White Hart Lane for a club-record £30million, Lamela was using his go-to trick in Argentina for the youth team of River Plate. If it works, you're a God. If it doesn't, you're a fool. But Lamela appears to have the art of the 'rabona' down after his audacious outside-of-the-box strike against Asteras Tripolis on Thursday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch both of Erik Lamela's incredible 'rabona' goals . An even younger Erik Lamela for River Plate's youth team runs through with just the goalkeeper to beat .

Lamela's goal for River Plate was one-on-one, on the move and finished with a cheeky chip over the approaching goalkeeper. His 'rabona' against Asteras, however, will take some beating as it glided into the far corner beyond goalkeeper Tomas Kosicky from more than 18 yards out. The man nicknamed 'Coco' may not have total confidence in his right foot but, when capable of that with the left, little can be done to criticise the Argentina international. Lamela wraps his left foot around his right to score an outrageous 'rabona' goal on Thursday night . Lamela's incredible strike doubled Tottenham's lead against the visitors as they went on to win 5-1 . It prompted Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino to say afterwards: 'Was it the best goal scored by one of my teams in my career? Probably, yes. 'He practises it every day in training. It’s a goal only a player with his skill can score.'

"Roy Hodgson worst fears were realised on Sunday as NFL sides the Jacksonville Jaguars and Dallas Cowboys dug up the Wembley pitch less than a week before England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia. The Cowboys beat the Jaguars 31-17 in front of a packed crowd but mud was seen flying up on a regular basis as the gridiron stars pounded their way around the turf just six days before Hodgson's men are due to play.

"A convicted killer was chosen to promote the new hotel owned by Manchester United heroes Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs, it was revealed today. Kevin O'Dea, 28, was jailed for seven years in 2008 for the manslaughter of student Sion Hardy.

His trial heard he was 'central' to the attack that killed him . It appears the millionaire former footballers were unaware he was a killer but the hotel refused to comment today. Sion's victim's father Robin Hardy, who along with his son is a Manchester United fan, believes it is an insult. 'I guess they must think he's served his time but I'll never forgive him for taking my son away,' he told The Sun. 'He's been released but I feel I have a life sentence'. O’Dea, who was 22 and a sports science student, was found guilty of manslaughter at Liverpool Crown Court in May 2008 along with his friend Simon Taylor. Their victim, Sion, from Bangor, Gwynedd was described as a 'special, unique and happy person' by his family. He had been at Nation nightclub in Liverpool with friends and was later attacked when he left   after receiving a fatal blow to the neck. He was attacked as he walked through a nearby underpass where O'Dea and his gang pounced, and the model was described as 'central' to the attack. The Liverpool University student suffered a brain haemorrhage and was pronounced dead at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. After the attack, O’Dea and his pals were seen 'celebrating' after the brawl, but despite his protests that he was acting in self-defence it was dismissed by a jury who convicted him in 2008.

"They're often regarded as supermen, but the sporting world has been reminded in no uncertain terms this week that footballers are as heartbreakingly human and fragile as the rest of us. The news that Newcastle United winger Jonas Gutierrez is battling testicular cancer, and cried when he received the diagnosis, will have touched even the toughest of souls these past few days. None will have understood more what he is going through than Hibs manager Alan Stubbs. He survived the same condition twice, having first been diagnosed following a routine medical check when he was a Celtic player in the late 1990s. Newcastle United's Jonas Gutierrez revealed that he has been battling testicular cancer this week . While his thoughts naturally go out to Guiterrez, who is back in his native Argentina following emergency surgery, Stubbs has also been giving more direct assistance to a young man recovering from cancer closer to home this week. The Easter Road boss is an advocate of keeping positive in such trying circumstances, and revealed yesterday that he has been offering help and advice to Dundee United player Jordan Moore following the Tannadice youngster’s own battle for survival. Moore, still just 20, was told he was suffering from melanoma skin cancer during a loan spell with Dunfermline and has shown remarkable maturity and courage to fight back, mercifully being given the all-clear several months ago. However, with mental and physical scars that would unsettle a man twice his age, it was encouraging to hear he has been benefitting from an understanding ear and some sage wisdom. Stubbs, a close friend of United boss Jackie McNamara, said: ‘I got a phone-call from Dundee United and they have a young lad [Moore] who was diagnosed with skin cancer. I was asked to go through and speak to him. ‘From that point of view he will be fine, however he is having to deal with a lot at such a young age and being open and speaking to people can be difficult. ‘The diagnosis will take you to dark places and the mind-set will be: you think you are going to die. Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs survived cancer while a professional footballer . ‘It gives you a real vulnerability and you do think: “What if?” When you are by yourself you do think: “Is this the end?” When you feel a different pain you imagine it to be somewhere else. ‘He needs to be as positive as he can,’ added 42-year-old Stubbs, who has become an inspiration to many sportspeople after writing candidly on the topic in his autobiography, How Football Saved My Life. ‘The boy is going through a tough time at the moment and we had a chat and it was good for him psychologically just to bounce off someone and speak abut things.’ Moore, thankfully, is at the end of his journey back to full health and he continues to do admirable work in the field of raising awareness regarding the illness, belying his tender years. However, Newcastle United stalwart Gutierrez is at the start of his own battle with cancer. The 31-year-old fans’ favourite, who has been at St James’ Park for six years, has had his left testicle removed after the discovery of a tumour and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. Although not acquainted with him personally, Stubbs knows the man by reputation and admires his tireless playing style and character. And he is certain that tenacity will serve Gutierrez well as he embarks on a bid to survive an increasingly beatable illness. ‘We have made giant strides since I was diagnosed with testicular cancer,’ Stubbs continued. ‘If you are going to get cancer then testicular cancer is the one you want because of the high success rate. Dundee United's Jordan Moore fought back after suffering from melanoma skin cancer . ‘There is a 95 per cent success rate and if anybody gave you those odds in whatever battle you were facing you would grab it with both hands. ‘Negative thoughts will go through Gutierrez’ head, but he will have the best care and he needs to stay close and have his family around him and stay strong. ‘You only have to look at other people who have gone through similar situations - there is light at the end of the tunnel. If the diagnosis is good then the outcome will be positive for him. ‘Hopefully they will have found out quick enough and it won’t be long before we see Gutierrez back on the pitch fighting fit. He looks a tough character and determined guy. ‘He is the sort of guy you can kick but will get up and keep coming back at you! If he takes that mentality with the illness I have no doubt he will beat it.’ Amid an admirably candid discussion with Stubbs, it was easy to forget that his Hibernian side have a big game this weekend as they try to keep pace with Hearts and Rangers in the bid to return to the Premiership. Thankfully Jordon Forster was on hand to emphasise the importance - albeit one that was given a new sense of perspective by the week’s events - of their trip to face Queen of the South this afternoon. ‘We have been too easy to score against and we are working on that as a team,’ added the young defender following last week’s thrilling 3-2 win over Cowdenbeath. ‘But we are scoring goals, so you take the good with the bad and try to find the right balance.’","Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs issues message of hope .

'He's made his Premier League bow for West Ham and we will give him further Championship experience. I am grateful that the Club has demonstrated a willingness to enhance the squad and move quickly to get the move done.

"Male culture: Cressida Dick, Britain's most senior female officer, says women are put off armed units because they do not want to carry 'big guns' Fewer women  want to be armed police officers because they do not want to carry 'great big guns', Scotland Yard's most senior policewoman has said. Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick says that there is an overwhelming male 'culture' in armed units despite more women 'flooding in' to other departments. Women had in the past been forced to adopt 'manly' traits to get ahead, including dressing like men, not using make-up and having to 'swear more', 'drink more' and 'drive faster', she said. But the senior officer says that has 'completely gone' at the Met, but a macho-culture remains in firearms. 'I have to say, and it hurts me to say it as an old-school feminist, I do believe in our society and our culture, fewer women who join the police actually want to be armed,' she told a City of London meeting. 'I wouldn’t put it down to genes necessarily – I’d put it down to culture. In my lifetime it will always be more men using police firearms than women. 'We find it easier to have women in some of the areas like personal protection — where you happen to carry a firearm but it's all about other skills, surveillance, you happen to carry a gun in certain departments but it's all about other skills — than we do to get women interested in standing outside the embassy with a great big gun'. Mrs Dick, who joined the force in 1983, said the Met has changed for the better. There are more women but the figure still stands at eight to 10 per cent of the total number of officers, she said. 'A lot of the pioneers had to force themselves to be very manly,' she said according to the Telegraph. 'They even dressed all like men, they wore grey charcoal suits and nobody would wear a lot of make-up or clothes that were feminine. 'Some of them took on quite excessive traits, they would swear more, drink more, and drive a heavy car faster. And all that’s just completely gone'. Scotland Yard is currently being sued by its 'poster girl' firearms officer who claimed her career was held back because of her race and sex. Carol Howard, 34, says  she was intimidated by an 'aggressive' inspector who gad once 'scolded' her in front of other senior officers while he was armed with a Taser and a handgun, reducing her to tears. Row: Carol Howard, was the poster girl for the Met at London 2012, but is suing the Met for racial and sexual discrimination, right at the tribunal . The elite Diplomatic Protection Group officer, who helped safeguard London from terror attacks during the 2012 Games, claims she was picked on by a supervisor who monitored her Facebook account where she had posted images of herself in a bikini. Only authorised armed units are allowed to carry guns.

Meanwhile in February two ‘petite’ firearms officers were told to expect a pay-out of £70,000 after winning a sex discrimination case over the size of their big guns. The weapons were too large for their small hands and as a result they could not reach the trigger, their employment tribunal against the Civil Nuclear Constabulary heard. Victoria Wheatley and Rachael Giles also struggled with the grip of the pistols they were using – a Glock 17 – and they also claimed their heads and legs were too small for their protective gear. A female marksman was involved in disarming the murderers of Lee Rigby last year. The officer involved in the Woolwich shooting is one of only a handful of women in Scotland Yard’s elite CO19 unit. In London, although women fill about one in five police roles, they represent only a tiny proportion of firearms officers. The markswomen are highly trained and treated as equals in their units – if it falls to them to shoot at a suspect, so be it. Their skills are prized by police commanders, who desperately want to increase their number. They believe the presence of female officers at highly charged confrontations can often help defuse violence. In recent years the Met has held women-only recruitment days for its firearms units and appointed existing female officers  as mentors.Senior officers even considered running training sessions for women with childcare responsibilities – and investing in lighter firearms.In a recent interview, one woman firearms officer said: ‘Men and women have a different viewpoint.

"Andy Murray has said he has no regrets about declaring his support for a Yes vote on the eve of the Scottish independence referendum but does have reservations about the way he did it. The British number one made a late intervention into the debate by posting a supportive message on Twitter just hours before the polls opened last Thursday.

"The sombre rumours have stalked him down the decades, but now they are acquiring greater urgency. Muhammad Ali is gravely ill. Parkinson’s Syndrome, the brutal legacy of his 21 years in the professional ring, has tightened its hold and, at 72, there are signs that his battle may soon be over. In time, many will attempt to assess the career of the most dramatically gifted and socially significant sportsman who ever lived. But in the week ahead, we shall concentrate on the 40th anniversary of his most extraordinary achievement. ‘The Rumble in the Jungle’ sounds like one of those promotional slogans which emerge from a three-bottle lunch. Yet somehow it captured the swaggering audacity of the project which saw the two most celebrated athletes on the planet fight for the richest prize in sport in the small hours of a Kinshasa morning. Muhammad Ali looks on after knocking down George Foreman in the so-called Rumble in the Jungle . October 30, 1974: Muhammad Ali versus George Foreman. The heavyweight title was at stake, and the world was captivated. The fight was made possible by the President of Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko, a deeply corrupt human rights abuser, who systematically exploited the nation formerly known as the Congo for more than 30 years. Mobutu paid more than $10million to promote his own image. It was then an unimaginable sum, far more than fighters had ever commanded. But then, he was hiring the very best. Ali was 32 years old and was attempting to regain the title he had lost to Ken Norton more than a year earlier. Although many shared his own opinion that he was the greatest ‘of ahhhhhl tahm!’, they also suspected that he was past his peak, that after 46 fights his talents were eroding. Ali was brought to Zaire for the fight by the infamous President of Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko . Ali trains in front of a captive audience in Kinshasa before a cut to Foreman's eye delayed the fight . Above and beyond all this lay a widespread conviction that the 25-year-old Foreman was genuinely invincible, a monster, one of the most terrifying punchers the sport had known. He had won the title with a murderous dismantling of Joe Frazier, and he saw Ali as his lucrative victim. ‘My opponents don’t worry about losing,’ he said. ‘They worry about getting hurt.’ It was as near as this malevolent, taciturn presence ever came to humour. By dazzling contrast, Ali was a force of nature; bright, funny, endlessly personable and dauntingly handsome. Somebody once wrote of a fabled heavyweight: ‘Joe Louis was a newspaperman’s champion. He always finished in time for the first edition, so the guys could get to the bar before closing.’ Ali will forever be remembered as the greatest heavyweight boxer in history, but the sport took its toll . Ali took a lot of punishment by methodically drawing Foreman in to waste the younger fighter's energy . 60,000 roaring fans packed Kinshasa’s outdoor Stade du 20 Mai for the fight. 32 -year-old Ali was seven years older than his opponent and a fading former champ not expected to last more than three rounds. It is said that in the dressing room, Foreman and his ringside crew had knelt to pray that he did not kill Ali. 450 locations in the United States and Canada — and in some cinemas in the United Kingdom — screened the fight on closed-circuit television. 100 countries were estimated to have taken the fight, which was scheduled to start at 4.0am in Zaire to accommodate audiences in the US. 10 million dollars was split between the two — $5m each — paid for by President Mobutu. 45 Foreman first quit in 1977 and returned in the early Nineties — winning the world title again at 45, becoming the oldest heavyweight champion in history. Perhaps so. But when Ali started to paint his word-pictures, he made the bar seem a poor alternative. Before the Foreman fight, he ran through his repertoire. He was contemptuous: ‘Foreman’s a big old bully from Texas who used to beat up people on the streets.’ He was dismissive: ‘Foreman hits hard, sure. But hitting power don’t mean nothing if you can’t find nothing to hit.’ He spouted yards of his terrible poetry: ‘You think the world was shocked when Nixon resigned?/Wait till I whup George Foreman’s behind.’ And, right across the world, the public lapped it up. There was a false start when a sparring partner’s elbow cut Foreman’s eye and both fighters were required to remain in Zaire for a month while Foreman recovered. Ali spent much of the time storming around town and leading the locals in chants of ‘Ali, bomaye!’ (Ali, kill him!). Finally, on October 30, 1974, in the Stade du 20 Mai, before 60,000 people, a bell sounded and a fight began. Ali had the locals in Zaire chanting 'Ali, bomaye', which translated means 'Ali, kill him!' Ali begins returning the heavyweight champion of the world's blows with interest . The legend has grown, these past 40 years, that Ali offered himself as a target, that he simply lay on the ropes and allowed Foreman to punch himself out. The promotional poster for the Rumble in the Jungle . Well, up to a point. Watching the fight through once again this week, it could be seen that for calculated spells, Ali encouraged Foreman to throw those scything punches, most of which were deflected by arms and gloves. But time and again he would cut loose from the ropes with bewildering combinations to the head. Foreman grew increasingly confused, unbearably weary. And all the time, Ali talked to him: ‘You was sp’osed to be bad, George! Show me something! That all you got, sucker? An’ you gettin’ tired, George. Ain’t no place to get tired ...’ And then, in the dying seconds of round eight, Ali found the energy and strength to throw the conclusive combination, and Foreman simply crumpled, exhausted, to the floor. I recall the London cinema erupting in joy and relief as the count finished and the aisles were awash with dancing, jostling figures. Ali had that effect; neutrality was not an option. I remember walking out into the Leicester Square dawn, and thinking I should never see anything quite like that again. And I never did. He would have a third fight with Frazier, a vicious battle in which both men inflicted enduring mental and physical damage. Then, as his resistance began to dissolve, every contest became an ordeal. Foreman puts up his guard as Ali surges forward in what has been described as 'The Match of the Century' Referee Zack Clayton counts out foreman after Ali puts him on the canvass in the 8th round . On October 2, 1980, in a casino car park in Las Vegas, I squirmed at ringside as Ali, old beyond his 38 years, was cruelly punished by Larry Holmes. He took punch after pounding punch to his unprotected head, but his perverse pride would not allow him to fall. So he stood and accepted his punishment, and the odious leeches who had taken his money and bathed in his glory simply shrugged and moved on. The illness which would ultimately devour him took hold. The speech grew slower and thicker, the reactions ponderous, the decline precipitous. As his condition became more distressing, it provoked serious moral questions about our readiness to condone such licensed barbarity. After all, if the very best of them could suffer such an excruciating fate, how can boxing hope to protect those who have only their courage to commend them? For many of us, the answer was all too obvious. Ali staged three fights with the legendary Joe Frazier, which left both men physically and mentally damaged . Ali's brash style changed the way that sportsmen behaved, although few have backed their arrogance with genius . Ali left a tangled legacy. Effectively, he legitimised boasting and strident self-praise. Before Ali, sporting modesty was mandatory; you were diffident in victory, gracious in defeat. After Ali, across all our major sports, the old rules fell into disuse. We now see an ordinary footballer celebrate a goal, or a journeyman cricketer a wicket, and all too easily we summon up a vision of a brash young man from Louisville, Kentucky. But the fact that routinely escapes the capering imposters is that the young man happened to be a genius. For once, it is not too inflated a term to describe what he did and how he did it. In this anniversary week, as Ali’s condition grows increasingly hazardous, I shall recall the words of George Foreman, when he made a visit to London two or three years ago. Foreman had escaped the fate which befell Ali. He was in robust health, and he was enjoying unprecedented riches, having lent his name to a hugely successful fat-free grill. Ali was stubbornly punished by Larry Holmes in his final fight in Las Vegas, 1980 . Despite losing the most memorable fight in history, Foreman still holds the highest respect for his tormentor . But he remembered his old opponent, warmly and without rancour. ‘People think they know about him, but they don’t appreciate just what a fighter he was’, he said. ‘I mean, I was pretty good. But Muhammad, he was something else.’ Foolishly, I asked if he could imagine another Ali emerging in this generation or the next. ‘You mean, will we ever see anybody like that guy again? he asked. He gave a small, pitying smile and said nothing. Some questions really don’t deserve an answer.","Muhammad Ali will be remembered as the greatest heavyweight of all time .

"Harry Redknapp has been gainfully involved in football management for more than 30 years. His successes have been few but his employment has been regular. This is because he understands how the game works. In particular, he understands the art of self-preservation. His performance after QPR’s latest defeat was taken straight from the play-book he helped to write. QPR are a desperately poor side and two years of Harry’s stewardship has not improved them. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Harry Redknapp at the press conference in which he hit out at Adel Taarabt for being unfit to play . Taarabt, about three stones overweight said Redknapp, wears gloves and a hat in QPR training . They were unfortunate to lose to Liverpool but the reality is that they are bottom of the Premier League with just four points from 24. It was time for a desperate manager to seek a diversion and Redknapp found it in an innocent query about his non-selection of Adel Taarabt. The resulting rant deserves to be enshrined in Gothic script. ‘I can’t protect people who don’t want to run and train and are about three stone overweight,’ declared Redknapp. ‘Taarabt’s not injured. He’s not fit to play football, unfortunately. What am I supposed to keep saying? Keep getting your £60,000, £70,000 and don’t train? What’s the game coming to?’ There was more in that populist vein but we sensed, not for the first time, that reality might shortly raise its voice. And Taarabt’s response was devastating. Far from being ‘three stone overweight,’ he was athletically trim. He stepped on the scales and posed for pictures to make his point. He also added a fascinating insight into Redknapp’s managerial methods: ‘He spends most of the time in his office but, when he gets off the phone, he comes down to watch for five or 10 minutes — he never takes a session. The training sessions aren’t the same standard as Milan, or what I would expect under another manager.’ Taarabt shows off his physique to Sportsmail photographer Andy Hooper in response to Redknapp's insults . Now if you were seeking a standard bearer for the ideal professional, then the unpredictable Adel Taarabt may not be your man. But he does not deserve to have his reputation spitefully smeared by a panicking manager. By now, Redknapp was pinned to the ropes, yet managed to prattle: ‘The only reason he has lost weight is because he has had tonsillitis — even I could suck my stomach in for a picture and look OK’. Tonsillitis! Even by Harry’s standards, it was preposterous. Either he had discovered the ultimate slimming aid, or he had been caught out in a fantasy. Judging by the derisive laughter, the public had made up its mind. QPR chairman Tony Fernandes apologised to fans for the ‘embarrassment’ caused by the ludicrous spat and spoke of his ‘disappointment’ with both manager and player. And we sensed that Fernandes may have found the episode strangely revealing. As the entrepreneurial driving force behind the successful AirAsia budget airline, he clearly has some awareness of the importance of tranquil relationships between employer and employees. Certainly, he will not have been familiar with the 19th-century approach to industrial relations which English football has unthinkingly embraced. Taarabt posted this image on his Instagram showing himself working hard on a bike during training . Taarabt attacks the Burton defence during QPR's Capital One Cup second round match in August . Ever since Redknapp came into the game, more than half a century ago, he has learned to regard the manager as the ultimate autocrat. His word is law, his authority is absolute. Privately, a player may think him wrong, foolish or simply incompetent, but such thoughts are never voiced. For he is the manager, the ‘boss’, the ‘gaffer’, ordained by custom and practice. And if that gaffer should decide to hurl a few public insults at a player who may have displeased him, well, that is his God-given right. Those employees are rather better rewarded these days; ‘£60,000, £70,000’, as Redknapp resentfully revealed. But the essential relationship is unchanged; they are still expected to doff their metaphorical cloth caps to the mill-owner, who can make or break them with a single, vengeful phrase. And they are expected to accept this Dickensian code without a whisper of protest. In truth, it is a feudal system which demeans the players and deludes the managers. But football at large has known no other way and managers like Redknapp are patently content with that situation. Redknapp's style subscribes to an outdated Dickensian management model that demeans players . Mercifully, the worm is starting to turn. The players’ sense of self respect is beginning to match their professional status. The Taarabt case is a poor example, since he has no future with QPR and therefore has little to lose. But other, more reflective, footballers increasingly deplore a system which demands such archaic deference. It is said that, in the closing years of his time at Old Trafford, Sir Alex Ferguson was steadily moving away from the old methods. Tea cups no longer flew, boots were no longer kicked and the hair-dryer was returned to its case. Players, in particular foreign players, were not prepared to be routinely insulted in that fashion. And Ferguson was a brilliantly talented, overwhelmingly successful football manager. If stars such as Ferguson could see the way the game was changing, then functionaries like Redknapp have no excuse for their insulting ignorance. ‘What’s the game coming to?’, he blustered. Perhaps it is time that somebody told him... How did Rodgers think he’d tame a £16m turkey? It is a truth universally acknowledged that football managers know more about the game than football fans. It is just possible that some managers may know even more about the game than football writers. So how on earth can an enormously accomplished manager like Brendan Rodgers make the kind of error that comes complete with neon lights and a government health warning? Brendan Rodgers is an astute and accomplished manager, but then he signed £16m turkey Mario Balotelli... The list of Mario Balotelli’s misdemeanours would fill a charge sheet. Managers of the stature of Jose Mourinho and Roberto Mancini repeatedly tried and ultimately failed to harness his fitful talent, Mourinho declaring him ‘unmanageable’. And yet, just a week before the close of the last transfer window, Rodgers convinced himself that he could handle the player. So he handed Milan £16million, and bought himself a turkey. Now in the real world, £16m is regarded as rather a lot of money. But in the Neverland of the Premier League, it may be seen as no more than a punt, a throw of the dice. Balotelli, during another bad day out for Liverpool against Hull on Saturday, has been dubbed 'unmanageable' If Balotelli comes off, it’s a coup. If not, well, we can always move him on. And yet, when the signing was made, there was something in Rodgers’ remarks which hinted at uncertainty. ‘I do not have any concerns,’ he said. ‘He comes in with a reputation but we hope we can curb that behaviour… He knows his flaws … It is a calculated risk but I hope we can improve him as a player and mature him as a young man. We think he can do very well for us.’ When Liverpool went three goals down to Real Madrid the other evening, the coldly disdainful reaction of Balotelli’s colleagues told us precisely how well the experiment was going. Balotelli failed to finish from three yards as Liverpool drew a blank against Hull City . He wore his indolence like a uniform, and that pantomime piece of shirt-swapping at half-time told us just how much he cared. So abject was his performance that, in his club’s biggest match of the season so far, he could not be risked for the second half. Obviously, Balotelli is not the only reason for the current problems at Anfield. But he was the avoidable error, the misguided hunch, the £16m mistake which should never have been made. We are not wise after the event, because everyone from fans to scribblers to the dogs in the street sensed it when he was signed. Yet Brendan Rodgers went ahead with the deal. And now he must cope with the consequences. PS .

"A Minnesota judge signed off on a settlement today in a groundbreaking case that accused Catholic church leaders in Minnesota of creating a public nuisance by failing to warn parishioners about an abusive priest. Ramsey County Judge James Van De North approved the settlement after meeting with both sides Monday, said Jeff Anderson, an attorney for the plaintiffs. Neither Anderson nor church officials would give details ahead of a 1 p.m. news conference. The case against the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis and the Diocese of Winona (pictured) is believed to be the first clergy sexual abuse case nationwide to use the public nuisance theory at trial . A statement from Anderson's firm said church officials in St. Paul and Winona had agreed to 17 child protection protocols. 'This is a landmark case,' Anderson said. 'It's monumental in a lot of ways.' The case against the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis and the Diocese of Winona is believed to be the first clergy sexual abuse case nationwide to use the public nuisance theory at trial. That claim allowed victims' attorneys to seek evidence of sexual abuse across the archdiocese, rather than focus on allegations against one individual. It forced the unprecedented disclosure of tens of thousands of church documents and the names of dozens of accused priests. The flood of information, which included the public release of court-ordered depositions of Archbishop John Nienstedt and other church leaders, revealed how top officials handled allegations of misconduct by priests. The disclosures compounded an already difficult year for church leaders. Last fall, a former archdiocese employee went public with allegations that church leaders had mishandled several cases in which priests were accused of abuse. Thomas Adamson (pictured) said in a deposition earlier this year that he molested around 12 teens from the 1960s to the mid-1980s . Police began investigating several allegations, and Nienstedt himself was accused of sexual misconduct, which he denied and resulted in no criminal charges. Nienstedt has apologized for any mistakes, but despite public calls for his resignation he told the AP in July that he wouldn't step down, and that he doesn't believe he mishandled the situation. Lawyers for the church had asked that the case be dismissed, saying the public nuisance claim didn't stand up, but Van de North allowed it to proceed. The case was filed in May 2013 under a law that opened up a three-year window for victims of past sexual abuse to file claims that were otherwise barred under the statute of limitations. Similar windows for lawsuits in other states have resulted in payouts in the tens of millions of dollars or more. The plaintiff, identified in court documents as Doe 1, claims he was abused by Thomas Adamson in 1976 and 1977, when the victim was an altar boy in St. Paul Park. The complaint also alleged the archdiocese and diocese were negligent in allowing Adamson continued access to children, even though leaders knew he had behaved inappropriately with young boys. Adamson said in a deposition earlier this year that he molested around 12 teens from the 1960s to the mid-1980s. He was removed from active ministry in 1985 and defrocked in 2009. He was never criminally charged. Adamson has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached.","Catholic church leaders in Minnesota are accused of creating a public nuisance by failing to warn parishioners about an abusive priest .

"Claim: Experienced teacher Perena Polius-Curran took Basildon Academies to a tribunal after the job she wanted went to a newly-qualified candidate . An experienced maths teacher has won her claim for racial discrimination - after the job she wanted went to a newly-qualified candidate. Perena Polius-Curran, 42, of Eaton Socon, Cambridgeshire - who is of Black Caribbean origin - took Basildon Academies in Pitsea, Essex, to an employment tribunal. She claimed the school had failed to interview her properly for a head of department role - despite her 10 years’ experience - and instead gave the job to a newly-qualified teacher. Judge Julia Jones upheld her discrimination claim, and found Mrs Polius-Curran was treated unfairly ‘not because of her lack of qualifications or lack of ability, but the difference in her race.’ Mrs Polius-Curran said: ‘I’m very pleased with the judgement, but sitting though the hearing and reading the verdict has bought it all back. ‘I’m not sure I will ever teach again, and it’s made me think what I’m going to do with my life. It was an awful experience, and one which I’m terrified of going through again.’ The hearing, which took place at East London Tribunal Hearing Centre in Poplar, heard Mrs Polius-Curran first applied for a job at the Basildon Upper Academy through an agency at the end of 2011. She stated she wanted a more senior role and was particularly interested in the head of maths vacancy, but went on to accept a job as a £40,000-a-year teacher in April 2012. Bosses at the Basildon Academies felt she was unsuitable for a management role because she had taken a five-year break to have a child, but failed to give her any formal feedback. The senior team also promised to give her training to become an advanced skills teacher but later back-tracked on this, saying her performance was not good enough. But it turned out there was no funding available for the role. Discrimination: A judge found Mrs Polius-Curran was treated unfairly by Basildon Academies in Pitsea, Essex . The tribunal heard the head of department job went to Will Coombs, a newly-qualified teacher of white British origin, who did not have to go through the formal application procedure. Another junior teacher, whom Mrs Polius-Curran had helped mentor, went on to become deputy head of department. She handed in her notice at the end of February 2013, and left the next month. Judge Jones said: ‘It is our judgement that Mr Coombs was appointed without interview, without any objective assessment of his suitability for this post and without responding to an advert. ‘Mr Coombs was effectively “tapped on the shoulder” and invited to apply. This is totally different from the claimant’s situation where her agency had put her CV forward and asked that she be considered for the post.’ The judge stated that because of these differences, 'we can infer less favourable treatment on the grounds of race'. Claim: Mrs Polius-Curran first applied for a job at the Basildon Upper Academy through an agency in 2011 . Mrs Polius-Curra - who gave up a job at Westcliff High School for Boys, a grammar school 12 miles away in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, to join the Upper Academy - is set to be awarded compensation, but a date has not yet been scheduled for a further hearing. Despite being offered jobs at schools in Cambridgeshire, Mrs Polius-Curran has struggled to face work since. Basildon Academies is planning to appeal the decision. Mrs Polius-Curran, who was born and bred in Dagenham but moved to the Basildon area while working at the Upper Academy, also made a complaint of harassment but this was thrown out. She felt her bosses failed to support her, and even undermined her in front of a class by failing to help her discipline pupils. During her time at the £50million Basildon Academies, which opened in 2009, it was put in special measures. This came after an Ofsted report in March 2012 that graded both Academies as 'inadequate' for pupils' achievement, behaviour and safety, the quality of teaching and leadership and management. The Academies said in February this year that they had both been taken out of special measures. An Academies spokesman could not immediately comment when contacted by MailOnline today.","Perena Polius-Curran was £40,000-a-year teacher at Basildon Academies .

"The family of a woman who went on a huge shopping spree after £52,000 was accidentally transferred into her account yesterday sprang to her defence, claiming she was just ‘making hay while the sun shines’. She simply ‘seized a good opportunity’ and did what any other young person would have done in her situation, they claimed. Michaela Hutchings, 23, spent £9,000 on expensive designer shoes, handbags and sunglasses in a two-day spending splurge after finding the transfer from her council. Cheers: Michaela Hutchings went on a spending spree after she found her £52,000 in her bank account. She was on Monday found guilty of dishonesty and retaining a wrongly credited bank transfer . Instead of reporting the error – as the law requires – she also gave her mother £1,000 in cash, and put £40,000 into a savings account, before she was caught by police on April 24 last year. Her grandmother, Phyllis Hutchings, 67, blamed the council, insisting that Hutchings was a ‘good girl’ who ‘doesn’t deserve’ to be punished. ‘Michaela’s not to blame,’ she added. ‘She’s just done what a lot of other people would have done. A lot of youngsters would think, wow-wee, make hay while the sun shines.’ Her grandfather, Roy Hutchings, 71, who lives with his wife in Lichfield in Staffordshire, added: ‘She didn’t think what she was doing was illegal.’ Dozens of friends and family also supported the mother of one on Facebook yesterday. A friend, Emma Armstrong, said she would have withdrawn all the cash then ran away, adding ‘that’s not dishonest, it’s seizing the moment!’. Another, Abiegayle Keisha Warburton, said: ‘Its only the councils fault not yours i know a few people thats had random money and spent it.’ [sic] . Others said they would have done ‘exactly the same’. 'Seizing a good opportunity': Hutchings in self-shot pictures posted online. The 23-year-old spent £9,000 on designer shoes, handbags and sunglasses in a two-day splurge after finding the transfer from her council . Hutchings’ mother Elaine last night blamed her daughter’s crime on her ex-partner, who cannot be named for legal reasons. She said Hutchings had been pressurised into spending the windfall by her ‘money-grabbing’ ex who is now in custody over a drugs-related offence. ‘He was the one behind this, but . Michaela is the one left with the bad reputation,’ she said. ‘He wanted . to spend it all – he wanted all these expensive jeans and belts and . spent some of the money when she wasn’t even with him.’ Under the 1968 Theft Act, if you realise money has been paid into your bank account by mistake, you must repay it. Keeping the unexpected windfall could lead to a charge of ‘dishonestly retaining wrongful credit’ and to a prison sentence of up to  ten years. In rare cases defendants have successfully argued that they did not realise they had been paid the money in error and have not had to return it. Mrs Hutchings, who lives in a large country home in Lichfield with her husband and Michaela’s father, Sean, said their daughter has ‘gone into hiding’. She added: ‘He left her terrified. Even though he’s in prison, we are worried about what he could do to her.’ Hutchings was found guilty of dishonesty and retaining a wrongly credited bank transfer when she appeared at Stafford Crown Court on Monday. Recorder Derek Desmond accepted she had been encouraged to spend by her boyfriend. Hutchings, who works part-time at her parents’ vehicle hire company, was given a 12-month community order and told to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. The court heard an administrative error meant Lichfield District Council accidentally transferred £52,000 into her account. Hutchings allegedly ignored repeated phone calls and visits and claimed she thought the money was an inheritance. She will face a further investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act relating to the £40,000 she invested.","Michaela Hutchings simply 'seized a good opportunity,' her family claim .

"Aya, five, from Idlib in northwestern Syria, is a happy little girl who loves playing with her sisters and is doted on by her mother Sihan and father Ayman. But the future is bleak for little Aya because, having been forced to flee to Lebanon in the face of the IS advance through Syria, she has no access to the medical care she desperately needs. 'She can’t cope with the cold weather,' says her worried mother. 'She has almost no chance of surviving if she doesn’t get care or a warm house.' Happy little girl: Aya, left, plays with her sister Iman and her mother Sihan in the refugee camp they call home . And, as a heartbreaking new documentary makes clear, Aya, who suffers from spina bifida and is paralysed from the waist down, is by no means unique. More than a million Syrian refugees currently live in Lebanon, eking out a living in the makeshift camps that dot the countryside. Making the problem worse is the Islamic State advance, as refugees fleeing the jihadis add to pressure on camp clinics and food supplies. Although agencies such as UNHCR are attempting to deal with the influx, life for disabled refugees, among them those who have lost limbs thanks to the bloody civil war, is particularly difficult. Aya, who suffers from spinal bifida, has a shunt that drains fluid from her brain, although it hasn't been replaced since she arrived at the camp. Scarce: With more refugees flooding in, in the face of the IS advance, finding doctors to treat Aya is impossible . Desperate times: Aya's father Ayman has been unable to find work in the camp and says he feels useless . She is also prone to pressure sores, which are now being treated by her mother, albeit with a wadded up old t-shirt instead of the dressings she needs. The situation is far from ideal and her father, the manager of a soap factory in their old life in Syria, knows it. 'It’s very difficult,' he admits. 'I feel useless. When I’m sitting at home without work [to pay for medical care] I might as well be a chair.' The family do get some help from UNHCR in the form of food coupons worth $140 a month but doctors require money that Sihan, a former school teacher, and Ayman just don't have. 'You need money to go to hospital, but I have to borrow money just to buy bread for my children,' says Sihan. 'That’s all I can do . Big cuddle: Aya, who her mother describes as being 'like sunshine', reaches over to give Sihan a hug . Help: Aya's older sister Iman was the one who carried her into Lebanon as the family fled the IS advance . Limited: Although the family are given money to buy food by UNHCR, funds for medical care are nonexistent . 'You can see our humiliation,' she adds. 'You see your daughter dying and no-one helps. In this camp no-one helps anyone. 'We didn’t live like this in Syria. My children went to the best schools. We lived a happy life in Syria.' But help, it seems, is not likely to be forthcoming any time soon. 'I would be the first to tell you that what refugees are able to receive does not meet all their needs,' admits UNHCR's Ninette Kelly. 'With 30 per cent of our budget funded, it’s simply impossible for us to cover all the basic needs that we need to cover. 'I feel so sad for them, so sad for their families, and also very sad for the frontline workers that have to be able to say I’m so sorry, we feel your need but we’re just unable to do anything about it because we don’t have the resources to do it. Deadly: As IS advance, more and more refugees are flocking across the border to Lebanon . Horror: Although air strikes have been launched against IS, they still hold several towns, including Raqqah . 'And it all comes back to where is the source of this problem? The source of this problem is the on-going conflict in Syria that is wreaking havoc in this region, and that has torn apart so many lives with devastating consequences to Aya and to others.' In the meantime, Sihan and Ayman are hoping for a miracle. 'She makes me feel that life is beautiful no matter what,' says Sihan of her youngest child. 'She’s stronger than she looks. When she was born, the doctors said there was no chance for her to survive and yet she’s still alive . 'Aya doesn’t want to die. Aya wants to live.'","Aya, five, has spina bifida and lives in a refugee camp near Tripoli .

"Nothing has stopped Nathan Charles from fulfilling his lifelong dream of starting with the Wallabies tonight– not even taking 28 tablets each day to manage his Cystic Fibrosis. The Western Force hooker’s parents were told when Charles was just three months-old that he would be lucky to live until he was 10. But the 25-year-old’s positive attitude and sheer determination has seen him prove the medical professionals wrong as he gears up for the biggest day of his life when he faces the New Zealand All Blacks in the Bledisloe Cup clash on Saturday night.

Nathan (far right) credits his parents David and Heike Charles (seated centre) for instilling him with a 'can do' attitude . Charles’ blatant refusal to allow his condition to impact on his life, including taking large amounts medication daily, has paid off immeasurably. ‘I just manage it on the side and not let it affect my on field performance,’ he said. He credits his parents for instilling in him that there was no reason why he couldn’t live a normal life when growing up in Glenhaven in northwest Sydney. ‘You’re always influenced by the way you are grown up - my parents brought me up like that’ he said. ‘They always said I could do whatever I want and not let anything get in the way so that’s the attitude I’ve adopted.’ Not one to shy away from the occasional beer or takeaway meal, Charles insists that his diet is no different to any other professional rugby player. ‘I have everything in moderation with food and with drinking as well - I’m not extremely anal about what I have and I still enjoy myself,’ he said. ‘I’m a very healthy active person – I don’t smoke and don’t drink a hell of a lot and I’m just always making sure I'm quite hygenic so I don’t pick up any other bug or infections.’ Charles has the same diet as any other professional rugby player with moderation being the key .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced that the Australian government will donate $20 million to help staff a 100-bed Ebola response clinic in Sierra Leone. Mr Abbott said that the government would be contracting an external company to deploy staff to the region. The clinic will be built by the UK and over 200 staff will be needed to run it, comprising mostly of locals. However, Australian volunteers and international medics will also be needed. The mission follows a deal struck between the governments of Australia and the UK and healthcare provider Aspen Medical to manage services in a British military field hospital in Sierra Leone. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced that the Australian government will donate $20 million to help staff a 100-bed Ebola response clinic in Sierra Leone. Mr Abbott said that he has received assurances the 100-bed clinic would treat Australians who contract the disease overseas as if they were British citizens. He also revealed that  a further $2 million will  be sent to Sierra Leone to enhance the regional preparedness for Ebola. Another $2 million will go to Australian logisticians working with UN agencies such as the World Health Organisation in West Africa. Mr Abbott stated that the chances of an outbreak of Ebola in Australia are still very low, but he said that the government recognises that this is a global problem.

As of October 31, 13,500 clinical cases of Ebola had been detected in West Africa. While there have been no confirmed cases of Ebola in Australia, almost 5,000 people have died from the disease in Africa. The Prime Minister also stated that the chances of an outbreak of Ebola in Australia are still very low. However, the government has been taking no chances and they have been ramping up security in preparation for the disease going global. Screening at airports has been installed for people arriving from west Africa. Mr Abbott said that while he acknowledges the impact Ebola is having internationally, he would like to keep the upcoming G20 summit focused on economic issues.

"Older people are more fearful of developing dementia than they are of cancer, a new poll suggests. Two thirds of people over the age of 50 fear that they will develop the condition while just one in 10 said they were frightened about getting cancer. When 500 adults aged over 50 from across the UK were asked which condition they feared the most, 68% said dementia and 9.44% said cancer. Fearful: Kate Owens pictured with her mother Ann Owens who has Alzheimers (File photo) Meanwhile just 3.88% said they were frightened about getting a heart condition and 0.73% were concerned about developing diabetes. There are around 800,000 people with dementia in the UK but as the population ages this figure is expected to soar in coming years. Symptoms can include memory loss and difficulties with thinking, problem-solving or language. It occurs when the brain is damaged by diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or a series of strokes. 'As an increasing number of people are diagnosed with dementia more people are seeing the profound impact that it can have on both the individual as well as the wider family,' said Paul Green, director of communications at over-50s company Saga, which conducted the survey. Choreographer Arlene Phillips's father Abraham (unset with a younger Arlene) suffered from dementia . 'However whilst these fears are completely understandable, it's important that education around the condition is enhanced to give a greater understanding of the benefits of early diagnosis - and how this can help those living with the condition continue to lead fulfilling lives.' Commenting on the poll Hilary Evans, director of external affairs at charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'It's no surprise to learn that fear of dementia in people over 50 is high: dementia affects over 820,000 people in the UK and we currently lack treatments to tackle the condition. 'The challenge is to find new ways to treat and prevent dementia to show there is hope of taking on dementia and beating it. Research holds the answer to this devastating condition and with the number of people affected set to grow as the population ages, the need for investment in research has never been more urgent.' Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden, 43, supports the Dementia Friends campaign to help highlight that people with dementia can still live fulfilling and rewarding lives with a little help from their friends . Prime Minister David Cameron listens to TV presenter Fiona Phillips during a reception in Downing Street . Alison Cook, the director of external affairs at the Alzheimer's Society charity, added: 'The possibility of losing the very essence of what makes you the individual that you are is a frightening prospect. 'But fear can mean people don't get a diagnosis and can often miss the opportunity to access treatments (which are only effective for people in the earlier stages of the condition) and the time to make important decisions about their future. We urge anyone concerned about dementia to speak to their GP and get in touch with Alzheimer's Society as there are lots of ways we can help.'","Only one in ten of 500 adults surveyed fear they will get cancer .

"What starts out as a serene video of the peaceful Utah terrain quickly takes a nose-dive in this hilarious clip. After taking a brand new Go Pro 4 camera out to film some of the stunning canyons near Price, Utah, the videographer got more than he bargained for. That helicopter attempted to zoom in on the stunning Pinnacle Peak - only to crash into the side of the rock and plummet to the ground. Scroll down for video . What starts as a stunningly serene video of the Utah landscape, quickly takes a dive (literally!) The amateur helicopter controller and videographer sent his brand new Go Pro 4 up to capture the vistas . 'My hometown has been experiencing some awesome sunrises and sunsets the last few weeks and I'd been taking still shots,' says the videographer and helicopter handler. 'On Friday, October 10, I received the Go Pro 4 in the mail and decided to try it out in my helicopter - a DJI F550 with a zenmuse H3-3D gimbal. 'I drove out to Pinnacle Peak, the spire in the shot, and started flying.' Soon after, however, the videographer lost sight of - and contact with - the helicopter. The Go Pro camera picks up speed as it heads towards the cliff face . Before disaster happens and the camera collides with the rock . Unfortunately, the controller lost contact with the helicopter when it flew behind a rock . 'The helicopter tries to fly back to you if it loses contact - it's a safety feature. 'I flew it behind the rock and lost contact, and when the helicopter tried to fly back to me, it flew directly into the rock. 'I tried to find it that night but it got too dark. I went the next day and couldn't see it at the base of the rock, so I gave up. 'I went up again on Monday and finally found it - clear down the mountain. It rolled quite a way.' When that happened, the helicopter attempted to circle back to reestablish a connection - and crashed directly into Pinnacle Peak . Several days later, the camera's owner did manage to salvage the footage, though the Go Pro was beyond repair . While the Go Pro obviously still records - even after colliding with a massive rock and tumbling down the mountain - the lens was scratched, the camera cracked, and the USB charging port bent, making it impossible to ever recharge. The moral of the story, you may ask? 'When you fly these Go Pros with a gimbal, you can't use the protective case,' says the amateur controller. 'And then the camera isn't protected in any way.'

"Transplanting new brain cells into patients diagnosed with Alzheimers could help reverse their memory loss, experts claim. A new study by U.S. scientists revealed a way to alleviate the learning and memory deficits caused by a gene linked to the disease. Their research saw improved brain activity, restoring cognition to normal levels in elderly mice. The transplants helped to replenish the brain, replacing the cells lost to the apoE4 gene, regulating brain activity and improving learning and memory abilities. Scientists in the U.S. believe transplanting new brain cells into patients suffering Alzheimer's could have reverse memory loss . The research was done by scientists at the Gladstone Institutes and the University of California. First author Leslie Tong, said: 'This is the first time transplantation of inhibitory neuron progenitors has been used in aged Alzheimer's disease models. 'Working with older animals can be challenging from a technical standpoint, and it was amazing to see that the cells not only survived but affected activity and behaviour.' The team behind the study said the success of the treatment in older mice, was particularly important given their age corresponds to humans in late adulthood. That is the age at which any treatment derived from the study, would be used therapeutically in Alzheimer's patients. Senior researcher Yadong Huang siad: This is a very important proof of concept study. The new study targeted cells that were lost due to the apoE4 gene, which is linked with the disease . 'The fact that we see a functional integration of these cells into the hippocampal circuitry and a complete rescue of learning and memory deficits in an aged model of Alzheimer's disease is very exciting.' Dr Huang said the potential implications for the findings are far reaching, and could pave the way for new treatments in the future. He said: 'Stem cell therapy in humans is still a long way off. However, this . study tells us that if there is any way we can enhance inhibitory neuron . function in the hippocampus, like through the development of small . molecule compounds, it may be beneficial for Alzheimer disease . patients.' The apoE4 gene, carried by around 25 per cent of the population and is involved in 60 to 75 per cent of Alzheimer's cases, disrupts the balance of the brain. It causes the decline of cells essential to maintain normal brain activity, particularly in the hippocampus - an important memory centre in the brain. Scientists carrying out the latest study hoped that by grafting those cells essential to normal brain activity into the hippocampus of elderly mice carrying the apoE4 gene, would replace the lost cells and restoring normal brain function. The new cells, transplanted into the brains, survived, enhancing the brain's ability to learn and remember.","The new brain cells could help reverse memory deficit and learning difficulty .

Mr Kumeroa's facebook page indicated he got engaged in March 2012 but it's believed he is now separated, with a young daughter. It was reported the New Zealander was sacked from his job on an oil rig in 2008, regarding a drunken incident and has struggled ever since, including financially . During the siege, police tried to negotiate with him for several hours, hoping for a 'peaceful outcome', but the incident which unfolded at around 4pm that afternoon, took a turn for the worst. Reports are he was threatening police before he suddenly jumped from his vehicle and pointed a gun at officers as he charged at them. Instantly police reacted, firing their weapons, and Mr Kumeroa is then sprayed with bullets and is seen slumping to the ground. Live footage then shows the police, who are fully decked out in protection gear, rush towards him, drag him from beside the vehicle and handcuff him. Aerial news footage then showed the riot police gathering around the man on a stretcher in the car park of the apartment complex. The Queensland police union say officers had no choice but to shoot a gunman after the lengthy stand-off. Reports that he'd pointed his weapon at officers are expected to form part of an investigation by the ethical standards command and a report is also being prepared for the coroner. Police are trying to negotiate with the man who locked himself inside a car at a block of units in Brisbane's south west . Police didn't get the 'peaceful outcome' they were hoping for when the gunman jumped out of his vehicle and he was sprayed with bullets. The action is all captured live online by TV choppers . The gunman is on the ground surrounded by officers after he was shot down . Union president Ian Leavers said the officers appeared to have no choice and were acting in self defence. 'That is the difficult and dangerous nature of police work. Things happen so quickly. You have to make instantaneous decisions, there are no other options,' he told ABC radio. He said the officers involved would be having a difficult time, and the union would support them, including through the investigation. 'I can say when you've used force, and things have changed dramatically, you never get over it. You have to learn to live with it and it is not easy.' Mr Leavers said the officers involved would receive ongoing counselling and legal support. 'These events, regardless of what the outcome is, are very traumatic for everyone involved,' he told AAP. Paramedics are called to assist the gunman who is shot several times by police after jumping out of the vehicle he was in pointing a weapon at officers. But he is pronounced dead . Man shot dead by police during stand off in Brisbane's south west on Monday. All action captured live online by TV choppers . He said he didn't want to comment on assertions from criminal lawyer Bill Potts that police had been provoked into engaging in 'suicide by cops'. 'It's too hard for me to comment on that issue ... it is what it is, and that will be determined by the coroner,' said Mr Leavers. 'I have full confidence in the police.' The Courier Mail reported police were called to a 'drug deal gone wrong', but police have not confirmed why they were called to the area, saying it was for an unrelated matter. A black armoured vehicle had been parked directly in front of the car with the man inside, while armed SERT officers monitored the situation and tried to talk him down. Brisbane regional duty officer, Inspector Richard Kroon, confirmed that police had been conducting an investigation at the units when they began speaking to the man. 'At about 3,45 further interactions had occurred and as a result of that a number of shots were fired and a 42-year-old man was subsequently pronounced deceased,' Insp. Kroon said. 'The matter is being investigated by the Police Ethical Standards Command and they will be preparing a report for the state coroner.' SERT Police attended the scene of a standoff with a gunman in the south-west Brisbane suburb of Inala . NSW police media reported of the siege: 'they've sent in the big guns' A home in Inala in Brisbane's south west, was surrounded by armed officers where a man armed with a gun hid in a parked car . Police surrounded him and were attempting a negotiation before the shoot-out . A resident from the Gannet St apartment block told the Courier Mail he was working on his car when he saw police arrive. 'Four policemen got out, went in, went around to where the car was sitting,' he said. 'They saw a gun and said ‘gun, gun, gun, drop the gun, drop the gun, drop the gun’.' Earlier in the day, Insp. Kroon said: 'There's no real threat. I don't believe he is a resident, and no one has been evacuated. 'They are speaking to him by phone that was given to him by police and police will take as long as it takes to negotiate a peaceful outcome. 'The best outcome is that the man comes out the vehicle, unarmed, and surrenders.' A police media spokesman also added: 'Officers are behind him, he's not going anywhere.' 'The man was being investigated for something, he came to the attention of police who found him in a car with a gun, he pointed it at them so they’ve sent in the big guns, a negotiator and the heavy duty cops in black,' he said.

"Jimmy Savile may have sexually abused patients at more than 40 NHS hospitals, the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt revealed this morning. Mr Hunt said the number of hospitals investigating allegations of abuse by the late DJ and TV star had been extended amid a slew of new sex abuse allegations. In a Parliamentary statement today Mr Hunt revealed that since the NHS Savile Legacy Unit was established in June, new allegations had been made about alleged abuse at 12 hospitals - including nine which had not previously been caught up in the scandal. Disgraced late broadcaster Jimmy Savile may have abused NHS patients at 41 hospitals, the Government revealed today . Savile is thought to have abused patients aged from just five to 75. The nine  hospitals which have not previously been embroiled in the scandal include: Birch Hill Hospital, Rochdale, Scott House Hospital, Rochdale, Bethlem Royal Hospital, South London, Shenley Hospital, North West London, West Yorkshire Ambulance Service, St Martin's Hospital, Canterbury, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, Meanwood Park Hospital, Leeds and Calderdale Royal Hospital, Huddersfield. Investigations were already ongoing regarding similar claims concerning three of the 12; Leeds Infirmary, Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire and the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle. The Legacy Unit has passed information from victims and the Metropolitan Police to the relevant NHS trusts. The fresh claims have emerged since 28 investigation reports into Savile's activities on NHS premises were published in June, Mr Hunt said in a written statement. Outstanding reports, including an investigation into Stoke Mandeville Hospital, have been delayed until later in the year at the request of prosecutors, the Health Secretary added. Earlier this week, the High Court heard the number of people intending to make claims after being sexually abused by the disgraced DJ has risen to more than 200. Savile – who worked at the BBC, where he presented Top of the Pops and was a Radio 1 DJ – was disclosed to have been a predatory paedophile after his death at 84 in October 2011. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said new allegations of abuse at 12 hospitals had emerged . There have been indications of legal claims against other organisations Savile had been associated with – the BBC, a number of NHS hospital trusts and the charities Barnardo's and Mind. In a written ministerial statement, Mr Hunt said: ‘At the request of the Crown Prosecution Service, the publication of the NHS investigations into Jimmy Savile is being delayed until the conclusion of ongoing legal proceedings. ‘Therefore, I wish to advise the House that there will be a delay in the publication of the outstanding NHS investigation reports. We now hope trusts will publish their reports in January 2015.’","Number of hospitals investigating allegations of abuse by late DJ extended .

"Hidden risks: Women who end their first pregnancy with abortion are 37 per cent more likely to give birth prematurely in the future (posed by model) Having just one abortion could raise the risk of potentially life-threatening problems in future pregnancies, young women were warned last night. Those who terminate their first pregnancy could be risking not only their own health but that of their next baby, a study has found. They are at higher risk of a range of problems, from their next child being born prematurely to pre-eclampsia, a complication of pregnancy that can be fatal to mother and baby. Crucially, just one abortion appeared to be enough to do the damage, with subsequent terminations not being any more dangerous. This differs from previous studies that found the risks rise with each abortion. Most of the risks were linked to surgical abortions and not those that use pills, which are becoming increasingly common. Almost 200,000 abortions are carried out in England and Wales each year, with the highest rates among women in their late teens and early 20s. In Scotland, 40 per cent of around 13,000 abortions are carried out in the under-25s. Abortion has been linked to premature births before but some previous studies have been small and the results have been mixed. To build a clearer picture, researchers at Aberdeen University analysed the medical records of more than 600,000 Scottish women, including many who had aborted their first baby. The data, spanning three decades, showed a woman who had an abortion the first time she conceived was 37 per cent more likely to give birth prematurely the next time she became pregnant, compared with one who was having her first child. Dangerous: Premature birth before 37 weeks is linked to several health conditions including lung disease, cerebral palsy, jaundice and mental health problems in later life . She was also 67 per cent more likely to give birth early than a woman who had already started her family. However, the risks were still lower . than those faced by a woman who had suffered a miscarriage, the British . Science Festival in Aberdeen heard. A woman who aborted her first . pregnancy was also at higher risk of having a baby of low weight and of . developing pre-eclampsia than one who was pregnant for the first time or . already had a child. Pre-eclampsia causes high blood . pressure, blood clots and kidney damage, and leads to the deaths of up . to 1,000 babies and at least six mothers a year. Medical abortions using pills are . normally used early in pregnancy and account for almost half of . terminations in England and Wales, and 70 per cent in Scotland. Researcher Professor Siladitya . Bhattacharya said surgical abortions may be more likely to damage the . womb, leading to later problems. He added women seeking abortions . should be made aware of the potential risks and medical terminations . should be available to all who would benefit from them. The British Pregnancy Advisory . Service, which carries out almost a third of abortions in the UK, says . the leaflets it gives to patients mention the link with premature birth. But they do not say abortion is the . cause because some of the reasons women choose to terminate a pregnancy – . such as unemployment, smoking or poor diet – are also linked to early . births. However, Philippa Taylor of the . Christian Medical Fellowship said: 'This study confirms many previous . findings... that all show a clear link between abortion and an increased . risk of a later pre-term birth.'","Aborting first-time pregnancies increases the future risk of premature births by 37 per cent .

"The husband of Brittany Maynard, who chose to end her life rather than suffer with terminal cancer, has said she was a 'beautiful person on the inside'. Dan Diaz, who was holding the 29-year-old in his arms when she took a lethal prescription of drugs in the bedroom of her Portland, Oregon, home on Sunday, said she had a 'personality you really get attracted to'. Talking to People.com, the 43-year-old described how they first met saying at first glance she was beautiful, but as they grew closer he realized she was also beautiful on the inside. Scroll down for video . Tribute; Dan Diaz (right), who was holding the Brittany Maynard (left) in his arms when she passed away on Sunday, said his wife was 'special' and had a 'personality you really get attracted to' Connection: He described how they first met saying at first glance she was beautiful, but as they grew closer he realized she was also beautiful on the inside. They are pictured on their weeding day at Beltane Ranch, California, in 2012 . Memories: The couple shared one of the last items on Brittany's bucket list - a trip to the Grand Canyon . In the October phone interview, that was published for the first time today, he added that she was 'attractive, energetic and outgoing'. 'For me it was meeting the person I fell in love with and that was Brittany. Jokingly, she would say I'd certainly been single long enough because there was an age difference between us. 'And ""What's taken me so long?"" and my answer was, honestly, that I hadn't met the girl for me until Brittany.' He said that he quickly realized that she was the woman he wanted to spend the rest of his life with.  They met when he was 35 and she was 23. After a five-year romance Mr Diaz proposed in May 2012, and the pair decided to get married that December. They tied the knot in the romantic setting of Beltane Ranch, California. 'Friends have told me our wedding was the best wedding they'd ever been to,' he told the magazine. Their honeymoon was their choice and, like a host of items on her bucket list, she wanted to adventure. They travelled to Patagonia, Argentina, for a trip that Diaz said turned out to be 'amazing' It was the best of both worlds,' Diaz told People. 'We'd go out to glaciers, go see nature, go for a hike and then come back and get pampered. 'So I'd say we really did it right where we had a lot of what she wanted – the outdoors, hiking and trekking and seeing the beautiful sights in nature – but then we'd also come back to the hotel and relax. Tribute: Brittany Maynard's mother Debbie Ziegler (pictured) described how her daughter would cartwheel for hours on end until she could do it perfectly. It was a sign of the love and effort she put into everything, she said . On Monday Debbie Ziegler, 56, Brittany's mother also paid tribute to her late daughter. She described everything from cartwheels as a child to volunteering in Nepalese orphanages that made her only child 'smart', 'charismatic', and 'driven'. A single mom, Ziegler raised Maynard alone in Orange County, California, where she worked as a science teacher. Last week Maynard cried in a parting message, describing the painful prospect of leaving her mother childless. But Ziegler insists she feels blessed to have the shared 29 years before her daughter contracted Glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive tumor in her brain. 'Early on, I told her, 'It would be my honor to take care of you, whichever way; if you need to be fed or diapered, it would be my honor,'' she said. 'And that was important for me, for her to know.' 'She was a smart, pretty and charismatic little girl, so she asked to do a lot of things and she generally excelled at all of them,' Ziegler reminisced to the People. 'If she took ice skating, she'd excel at ice skating,' she said. 'I can remember her doing cartwheels and my telling her, 'I could never do cartwheels,' but she just worked and worked and worked until she perfected it,' she said. She describes doing everything she could to give Maynard a vibrant childhood without siblings or a father. Love: She respected Brittany's decision to take her own life, saying it was her job to 'love her through it' Enriched: Ziegler describes how Maynard, pictured between her mother and husband, felt so strongly about the orphanages she worked in. Even suffering from cancer, she understood she had a high quality of life . Promise: She has promised to go to Machu Picchu on her daughter's behalf after her passing on Sunday . Plenty of their holidays were camping trips spent in Oregon, where Maynard - who married and took the last name Diaz - moved to end her life by taking advantage of the state's dignity with dying laws. On Sunday, she administered her lethal medicine and died in her bed at home in Portland surrounded by family. Twenty years earlier, she was just miles away dreaming of weddings and playing with her friend. 'She had a girlfriend, and she'd make clubhouses in these shrubs – dig under the shrubs and make little chairs and take out my silver-plated wedding gifts and bury them in the dirt,' Ziegler said. In the years that followed, Maynard went on to become a straight-A student at high school before enrolling at UC Berkeley then working in orphanages across south east Asia. Ziegler said the prospect of her daughter traveling to Asia was frightening, and she was astounded by the way Brittany dealt with the horrific situations she witnessed. Even after contracting terminal cancer, Brittany maintained . Ziegler said: 'She'd call me and say, 'Oh mom, it's awful.'' Debilitating: A scan shows the Glioblastoma multiforme that would claim her life slowly within 14 months . Tearful: Brittany wept days before her passing as she described the pain of leaving her mother childless . 'She'd try to get supplies and she'd take them to the orphanage, but the supplies never got distributed, so my daughter went in there and demanded to see where her supplies were. 'She said, 'I want you to show me where you put the supplies I gave you yesterday. They are for the children.'' 'She made them give them all back to her, and she took them into the room and gave them to the kids.' Maynard said, in the weeks before her passing, her biggest regret is that she never got to have a family, having worked extensively with children. 'I'd say most of my sadness centers around how much I wanted a family,' Maynard told CBS This Morning. However, the experience in Asia had a dramatic effect on Maynard's perspective on life: 'She knows that even with her brain tumor, she's still surrounded by love,' Ziegler said. 'She's still surrounded by comfort and care, and there are societies where that it not at all ever the case.' Now mourning the loss of her child, Ziegler said she will one day travel to Machu Picchu in Peru. She made a deal with her daughter that, after her passing, Brittany's spirit will meet her up there among the breathtaking Inca ruins.","Dan Diaz, 43, said his wife was 'special' and a 'good person to know'

"A mother and father are staging an early Christmas for their two-year-old daughter who has such aggressive cancer she may not make it to December. Calianna Griggs was diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome and adrenocortical carcinoma last spring. The genetic syndrome, which affects fewer than 500 people in the world, has created the rare cancer and given her more than 30 tumors on her lungs, one on her adrenal gland, another in her belly and one on her spine. Tragic: Calianna Griggs, aged two, has been given one month to live after contracting adrenal gland cancer . Last wish: Her parents Greg Griggs and Ashley Gonzalez hope to make her last Christmas the most special . Diagnosed: This is Cali in the early stage of her cancer last spring went she grew three dress sizes in 10 days . Despite undergoing intense chemotherapy twice and multiple surgeries, doctors at the hospital in West Valley, Arizona, have told her parents, childhood sweethearts Greg Griggs and Ashley Gonzalez, that she has between one and three months left. 'Calianna is our precious little angel, she is so sweet and deserves a chance to be with us a little longer,' her mother said. But Greg added that it is unlikely she will live out the full three months: 'We want her last Christmas to be the best and we also want for her funeral service to be very special.' And yesterday, they were delivered the painful news that she could have as little as a day left. Greg was tearful as he told MailOnline: 'She is in a world of pain that I couldn't even imagine. 'It is just getting harder and harder and harder.' The couple noticed something was wrong when Cali ballooned from aged two clothes to aged five clothes in just 10 days. She is now continuing to swell up and is becoming increasingly lethargic. Devastated: Her mother Ashley Gonzalez (pictured with Cali) said she cannot contemplate losing her daughter . Fun: Cali loves dressing up but she is finding it harder to breathe and play as her cancer gets worse . In a recent local TV interview, Greg broke down in tears as he could hear the microphone picking up Cali struggling to breathe. 'It was just too much. She finds it so difficult. Sometimes now she just sleeps for hours at a time.' Her mother updated family and friends on their GoFundMe page: 'She is so swollen now and her tummy is as hard as a rock. But the saddest part is she is struggling to breathe now. 'I am scared to fall asleep every night because I'm afraid she will stop breathing in the middle of the night.' Struggling to pay for groceries on top of the extortionate medical bills, Greg and Ashley are now trying to raise money for a final attempt at treatment to cure her or ease the pain. Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a disorder that affects a handful of people worldwide. It stems from mutations of either the TP53 gene or CHEK2 gene, which normally act as tumor suppressors by controlling the growth and division of cells. When mutated, it allows cells to multiply, grow and divide in and out-of-control nature, making sufferers more susceptible to cancer, especially leukaemia, brain and breast cancer. In many cases, one of the sufferer's relatives will have had a cancer that displays similar characteristics. Cali's LFS prompted adrenocortical carcinoma, a rare cancer that forms in the outer layer of tissue of the adrenal gland. The gland is a small organ on top of each kidney that makes steroid hormones, adrenaline, and noradrenaline to control heart rate, blood pressure and other body functions. The disease, which affects up to just two million people a year, has a five-year survival rate of 20-35 per cent. Symptoms include hair growth, weight gain, a lump in the stomach or back of the head, muscle weakness and high blood pressure. But with the understanding that it is unlikely to work, the funds will also go towards staging an early Christmas for Cali as well as a funeral. 'If nothing else this medicine could possibly make her more comfortable while she is here,' said Ashley. 'We also would like to celebrate Christmas with Calianna and are probably going to have to do it early now.' Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a disorder that affects a handful of people worldwide.

"A Connecticut man who went to great lengths to prevent police from seeing the test results of his DWI breathalyser has found himself in even more trouble. Charged: Authorities said Kenneth Desormes was arrested about 5:30 a.m. Sunday . Kenneth Desormes, 40, of Greenwich, was pulled over for speeding on Interstate 95 in Port Chester, north of New York City at 5:30 a.m. Sunday. He was quickly arrested on suspicion of being drunk, NBC New York reported. But when it came time to do some paperwork at the state police barracks in Tarrytown, Desormes allegedly became apprehensive. Police say that as his breathalyzer tests results were processing, Desormes grabbed the printout and quickly tried to eat it. However he wasn't quite fast enough. The results that hadn't been chewed through revealed Desormes had a blood alcohol content of 0.13 percent, police said. In Connecticut you are considered to be legally intoxicated if you have a BAC (blood alcohol concentration) of .08 or higher. Desormes was charged with the misdemeanors driving while intoxicated, second-degree obstructing governmental administration and third-degree criminal tampering. It is unclear whether Desormes was remanded to jail, released with an appearance ticket, or released on bail or bond.

"Jenny Winder, head teacher at Elstow School near Bedford, who is under fire for booking a Caribbean holiday during term time . An under fire headmistress has refused to apologise for arranging a Caribbean holiday during term time saying her 'private life is private'. Last week it emerged that Jenny Winder, 53, head of Elstow School, a primary school near Bedford, is taking a week off after the Christmas holidays for the break even though it will be the start of the school term. This is despite parents who take their children out of school during term time facing fines of £60 per child for unauthorised absences, with Mrs Winder being described as a 'hypocrite' for booking the holiday. But now the head, who has been in charge of the school for 14 years, has refused to give an explanation or apologise for taking time off. She said: 'My private life is exactly what it says - private.' The website for the school, which caters for four to 11-year-olds reminds parents  to book breaks ‘only in holiday time’ and encourages pupils to achieve ‘highest possible levels of attendance’. It adds that the school 'will not authorise' such absences and parents are fined £60 per parent per child per period of absence, which rises to £120 if not paid within 21 days. However, chair of governors Kevin Hunter defended Mrs Winder's holiday and said: 'She made what we have judged to be a request for a week off during term time for personal reasons which we have judged appropriate.' He added that Mrs Winder was 'devoted, well-liked, extremely hardworking and effective' but would not say why she was granted the leave. Bedford Borough Council said term-time leave for teachers was 'at the discretion' of governors. A spokesman said the head told the council she had never previously taken holiday during term time during her 14 years at the school. However, an insider told a local newspaper: 'Mr Hunter told the governors he … had agreed it and that they had to pass it … Three governors have since resigned, stating other reasons … the chairman now needs to take responsibility and resign himself.' In its last Ofsted inspection in 2009, Elstow School was rated as outstanding and Mrs Winder  is thought to be paid around £45,000 a year. Governors at Elstow School, pictured, approved Mrs Winder's holiday despite the fact their website reminds parents to only book breaks during the school holidays . On her Friends Reunited page, she describes herself as a former PE teacher now ‘too old, fat and unfit’ to teach the subject so has become a head instead. The mother-of-one, who is separated from her son’s father, is understood to be travelling to the Caribbean, where average daytime temperatures in January are around 28C, with her partner. However, one parent of children at the school said: 'Mrs Winder is taking a week off in the New Year after the children have gone back. 'This is so unfair as teachers already get so many holidays and yet we wouldn't be allowed to take our children out of school for even a day.' Some parents, whose children attend the school, pictured, have branded Mrs Winder 'a hypocrite' for booking the holiday . Another branded the decision as 'disgusting' and added: 'I've been fined twice for taking my children out of school and I put in a request to take them out next year and it's been refused. 'I think she should either give us an explanation why she is taking time off or at least grant people holiday to do it themselves.' Another mother, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It is disgraceful. [Mrs Winder] is a hypocrite. We can’t take holidays in term-time so why should she? The school is fast enough threatening parents with fines if they take their children out.’ It comes after families were told they were only allowed to take children out of school in ‘exceptional circumstances’ under measures brought in by the last Education Secretary, Michael Gove. The Sutherland family who took a holiday to the Greek island of Rhodes during term time. They are (left to right) Sian, mother Natasha, Keane, father Stewart and Rhiannon . Previously, heads had the discretion to allow pupils up to 10 days’ leave each year. Parents wanted the flexibility of term-time holidays to avoid the punishing premiums holiday firms add in peak periods. Parents who have branded Mrs Winder a 'hypocrite' for taking a holiday during school time have pointed to new measures, which mean they can be fined for taking their children on a term-time holiday. Previously, head teachers had the discretion to allow pupils up to 10 days of leave from school each year. However, under new measures brought in by former Education Secretary Michael Gove, children can only be taken out of school in 'exceptional circumstances'. Parents who take their children out of school without authorisation, they can face a fine of £60 for every child. Those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted, fined £2,500 and even face jail. Now they face a £60 fine each for every child who fails to attend school without permission – meaning a two-parent two-child family would be charged £240. Those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted, jailed for up to three months and fined £2,500. In the Bedford Borough Council area, where Elstow School is located, 432 parents were issued with a fixed penalty notice for taking their children out of school, when their absence was not authorised between September 2013 and July 2014. This compares to just 39 fixed penalty notices, which were issued between September 2012 and July 2013. Earlier this year, one of the first couples to be prosecuted for taking their family on holiday during term time were Stewart and Natasha Sutherland from Shropshire. The couple took their three children Keane, six, Sian, 13, and Rhiannan, 15, to the Greek island of Rhodes last September. Mr Sutherland, who works for the Ministry of Defence Guard Service said at the time that it was the first family holiday in five years as the couple had struggled to get time off work together. After refusing to pay the fines, they were prosecuted at Telford Magistrates Court and fined £630. Speaking at the time Mr Sutherland said: 'I know education is important but there's a bigger picture. Family time is important too.' It has been estimated that more than 24,000 children skip school every day to go on family holidays as parents ignore the threat of fines to escape peak-time price hikes.","Jenny Winder, 53, is to fly to the Caribbean after the Christmas holidays .

"Friends and family of a young black man shot dead by police in Utah last week have paid tribute to him as a shy and gentle arts lover at his funeral. 200 people gathered inside a Mormon church in Saratoga Springs yesterday  to remember 22-year-old Darrien Hunt, who police say was shot dead after he lunged at officers with a samurai-type sword. Mr Hunt was shot dead at a mall in Saratoga Springs last Wednesday, in an incident that has sparked intense debate over whether race played a role. His death came just one month after the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri sparked huge protests across the U.S. Grief: 200 people gathered inside a Mormon church in Saratoga Springs yesterday to remember 22-year-old Darrien Hunt, who police say was shot dead after he lunged at officers with a samurai-type sword. Upset: Darrien Hunt (left) was shot dead at a mall in Saratoga Springs last Wednesday, in an incident that has sparked debate over whether race played a role. After his death, Mr Hunt's mother Susan (right) asked: Would they have done that to any white boy? She was among 200 mourners at the 22-year-old's funeral yesterday . At yesterday's funeral, family friend Andrew Scivally said Hunt was trying to figure out how to be a responsible adult and was tackling challenges that were making him a better person, including participating in an all-night team running race. 'That's a tough part of life: you're one foot in this adulthood and your other foot is still over here being a kid,' Scivally said. 'Did Darrien make all the right moves and choices and steps? No. And neither did we, neither will we.' The fatal shooting didn't get much attention until Hunt's mother came out days later and said she believed her son was shot because he was black. A family attorney said an independent autopsy showed Hunt was shot six times from the rear, which he says shows Hunt was fleeing and casts doubt on the police version of the events. Authorities, however, say race played no role in the shooting. They say officers went on a call about a suspicious man walking near businesses in a strip mall while carrying a sword. He was shot after lunging at the officers with a sword that had a 2.5-foot steel blade, authorities said.

Susan Hunt, center, the mother of Darrien Hunt, walks behind his casket following funeral service yesterday afternoon (right). In the image on the left, an unidentified couple hugs following funeral services for Mr Hunt . The details of the shooting and the role race played weren't mentioned during the 90-minute funeral at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints meetinghouse. Afterward, Tamu Smith, a family friend from Provo, said she doesn't think a young white man with a sword would have been deemed suspicious. 'It's easy sometimes to look at a brown kid that is out of place in Utah, which is a lot of time, and say they look suspicious,' said Smith, a black woman who has two sons, 14 and 11. She called it 'heartbreaking' to see empty seats in the church, saying the absence of community leaders showed a lack of support for the family. This shooting, on the heels of others around the country of young black men by police, has her worried about her own sons. Saratoga Springs, a city of 23,000 people is 93 percent white and less than 1 percent black, U.S. Census figures show. Hunt had a white mother and black father. The shooting is under review by local authorities. Minutes to live: This photo of Darrien Nathaniel Hunt being confronted by two officers was taken shortly before they shot and killed him . Famiy: After her son's death, Susan Hunt, middle, said Darrien had been going through some tough times emotionally since she left an abusive relationship three years ago . Online court records show Hunt had a couple of previous encounters with Saratoga Springs police for a domestic violence dispute with a sibling and marijuana possession. Hunt's parents didn't speak during the funeral, but his father, Curtis Hunt, sang a tearful and emotional rendition of the song, 'My Soul Hungered.' Friend Duane Domino said there's not enough information yet to determine if race factored into the shooting, but he said Hunt's death has at least spurred Utah officials to reassess appropriate policing techniques. 'I have no idea what Darrien's doing now, but I'm sure he's loving deeper, caring more, and I'm almost sure there's some music is playing somewhere,' Domino said.","Crowd of 200 gathered at Mormon Church in Saratoga Springs for service .

"A daredevil attempting a 6,500ft paragliding jump narrowly cheated death after his parachute became tangled in mid-air. Justin Clarke, a 43-year-old IT consultant from Norfolk, had launched himself off the 6,200ft-high Mount Babadag in Turkey. Shortly afterwards, the lines of the thrillseeker's parachute became twisted, causing him to lose control of the glider. Mr Clarke is then seen trying to pull in the tangled glider in order to stop it dragging him off-course and into a nearby beach resort packed with holidaymakers . A small camera strapped to Mr Clarke's body captured the moment he began hurtling towards the sea. Despite remaining calm, he is shown desperately trying to re-gain control of the glider before opening up his reserve parachute. He is then seen trying to pull in the tangled glider in order to stop it dragging him off-course and into a nearby beach resort packed with holidaymakers. During his ordeal the lines of his glider also wrapped around his arms, resulting in painful burns as he attempted to land safely. After a couple of minutes, Mr Clarke is shown landing into the sea below before being rescued by a nearby safety boat. A small camera strapped to Justin Clarke's body captured the moment he began hurtling towards the sea . Justin Clarke had launched himself off the 6,200ft-high Mount Babadag in Turkey before the incident . Mr Clarke explained that he was an experienced paraglider, having completed around 65 flights previously. He had joined up with the Free Flight Academy where he was receiving training from instructor Lee Tryhorn about how to deal with emergency situations. It was the last flight on the training course, and Justin was learning how to carry out a full stall – a tricky safety procedure employed by paragliders to regain control and balance the glider in extreme weather conditions. He had already completed the manoeuvre perfectly twice before, but made a mistake on his third and final attempt which caused his lines to become tangled. Despite remaining calm, Justin is shown desperately trying to re-gain control of the glider b . Asked what was going through his mind as he realised he was in trouble, Justin said: ‘I had done two full stalls already and just did not complete the last one correctly. 'I lost control and the wing shot underneath me, which can be very very dangerous. 'If you fall into the wing cloth when it is below you, you end up “gift wrapped” and cannot throw your reserve parachute – being gift wrapped is a likely end of life experience. ‘Once I realised I had lost control of my glider, there were a few four letter words that ran through my head. ‘But we do it over water, with a safety boat below for the very reason things can go wrong, as was my case. After a couple of minutes, Justin is shown plummeting into the sea before being rescued by a safety boat . ‘Once I had thrown my reserve ‘chute, the main aim was to get my glider in, as it was down pulling me down wind, meaning I was heading towards the beach and the town of Oludeniz. ‘My instructor Lee Tryhorn was a diamond and it was with his instructions that I was able to learn to fly and to do stuff like this.' In 2010, 70-year-old grandfather-of-two Roger Parker escaped death after breaking his shoulder, elbow and foot when his tandem paraglider pilot crashed into the side of a mountain near to Mount Babadag in Turkey. Mount Babdag is hugely popular with tourists who pay around £50 to do a paragliding jump. The mountain’s height and proximity of its summit to the sea makes it particularly suitable for such extreme sports.","Justin Clarke, a 43-year-old IT consultant, was paragliding in Turkey .

"Abdul Murshid, 46, claimed more than £55,000 in housing benefit that he was not entitled to over more than six years . A petrol station worker who illegally claimed more than £55,000 in housing benefit and blew it all on holidays and parties has been jailed. Abdul Murshid, 46, claimed £700 a month in state handouts that he was not entitled while working at a Welcome Break service station on the M1. The father-of-four fraudulently claimed the benefits for more than six years before he was finally caught. Willesden Magistrates' Court heard how Murshid, who worked at the services near Edgware, North London, claimed £55,597.31 in benefits for rent on a property he part-owned. Murshid, from Harrow, north-west London, was jailed for 11 weeks for the 'severe' fraud over a 'substantial period of time'. The married man, who has two boys, aged 12 and nine, and two girls, aged six and two, was also ordered to repay all of the money. A Harrow Council spokesman said: 'Petrol station attendant Abdul Murshid was jailed for 11 weeks after a court heard how he lied about his arrangements to falsely claim £55,000 in housing benefits. 'The court heard that [he] used the £700 to spend on his family in a fraud that extended over more than six years. 'Magistrates said a jail term was justified because of the severity and duration of the fraud. 'In total, £55,957.31 was claimed fraudulently from October 2005 to March 2012 and Harrow Council will now seek to recoup the money.' Harrow councillor Sachin Shah said: 'People defrauding the benefit system take attention away from its real purpose. 'That purpose is to provide a vital safety net that catches people when they need it the most. 'A jail term sends a signal of just how seriously the courts take benefit fraud - it is not a harmless paperwork fiddle. 'We are going to pursue the defendant to recover money which belongs to the people of Harrow.'

She told Harper’s Bazaar: ‘When my brother was a soldier in Afghanistan, he was at a base around the corner from a girls’ school that had to be shut down because of the Taliban. They had poisoned the water source. The only way it could reopen was if a new well was built. So my brother took up the initiative, amazingly, and started raising money for this school.’ She continued: ‘War Child was a charity that responded immediately. Since then, my brother has been a big fan, and when he left the Army… we met with them and started talking about working together… War Child is just extraordinary.

"Julie Beattie, 24, was on fire when her sister Lucie arrived at the south London home, the Old Bailey heard. Julie's 49-year-old lover Ashley Williams allegedly doused her in petrol and set her alight . A young mother burned to death after telling her older lover she was leaving to be with his 18-year-old son. Julie Beattie, 24, was allegedly doused in petrol, set alight and hit over the head with a hammer by father-of-twelve Ashley Williams, 49, as she tried to run off with Ashley Williams Jnr. Sobbing in the witness box, her sister Lucie Beattie described arriving at their south London home to see groundsman Mr Williams put on his coat and walk out as Miss Beattie burned, screaming, behind him. She told the Old Bailey: ‘I pushed open the kitchen door and a lot of smoke came out. ‘I saw Julie. She was in flames.' At that point she fell to her knees in the witness box, as relatives and court officials sobbed in the gallery. Resuming evidence, Miss Beattie added: ‘I was scared to touch her. ‘I saw Ashley go back inside the house. ‘He put a jacket on and walked off, while Julie was on fire. ‘When . Julie was following me out of the house, the children were there and . they were screaming, so I took the children and I took them to the other . side of the car-park. ‘She kept saying: ""Hurry, call the ambulance"". ‘She kept saying she is hot and needs a drink and I didn’t know what to do. ‘Everyone was shouting at me not to put water on her and I didn’t know what to do. ‘I was so scared.’ The victim had suffered 90 per cent burns and died in hospital. The court has heard Mr Williams, who denies murder, had fathered four children with the victim, who first became pregnant by him when she was just 16. Her sister said the victim wanted to ‘wear vest tops, have a tattoo and have fun’ but Mr Williams would not let her.

Lucie, who was staying at their Walworth home, claims she arrived to find smoke billowing out of a window and ran in screaming: 'Where's Julie.' Mr Williams answered the door and told her to ‘come back in a minute,' she said. ‘Then Julie started screaming. ‘She said: “Please help me, call the police, he’s going to kill us. He’s got a hammer.""' The Old Bailey paused proceedings when Lucie Beattie fell to her knees in tears in the witness box . ‘Ashley kept saying “Go for a walk, its OK.” ‘Julie was trying to get out the house and he wouldn’t let her out.’ Lucie headed to the police station but turned back when she called the home and nobody picked up. 'Something made me go back,’ she told the court. ‘Julie had been screaming all that time and when I called Ashley it was silent. I turned round and I went back to the house.’ Mr Williams, who was also set on fire in the incident allegedly tried to slit his own wrists after the incident and told police he killed his partner ‘for a dare.’ He denies murder.

"A murderer who has spent nearly half a century behind bars is back on Britain's streets today. Alan Houchin, 75, was jailed in 1965 for strangling teenage waitress Shona Berry in Margate, Kent. After being released on licence 11 years later, he was again jailed for life in 1979 for the rape of a 19-year-old shop assistant. Alan Houchin, following his escape from custody in 1993, and the Daily Mail's headline from a report of the murder of Shona Berry in 1965 . After spending 46 of the last 49 . years behind bars, Houchin was released this week and is now planning to . get married to his former partner Mary Griggs, 54. There was anger at his release yesterday, with members of victim Miss Berry's family hitting out at the parole board's decision. A . relative, who asked not to be named, told the Daily Mirror: 'I am in a . state of shock. No one told me he had been let out. I am horrified. 'I had been told all along he was too dangerous to be let out of prison and he would never be freed.' Houchin's partner Mrs Griggs has said she plans to marry the former-convict at a ceremony later this year. The . couple are now living in a council house in Swanley, Kent, . but local residents have said they do not want him in the area. Neighbours say Houchin has been a . regular visitor to the house over the last couple of years as he was . allowed out of prison on day release. A Daily Mail report of the hunt for Houchin, who escaped from guards when he visited his dying father in 1993 . One said: 'He's always out there tinkering with his car. Mary told me he used to be in prison and she used to go and visit him and he would come and see her on day release too. 'Of course I've heard rumours about what he did. I've heard he killed a young girl and raped another girl. 'I've never asked him about it though - you just wouldn't. Mary keeps to herself, most of the time, which is something we all do around here. 'If he is a convicted murderer and rapist I definitely don't want him living round here.' Houchin's . victim Shona Berry was found dead in a park in the seaside resort of . Margate in August 1965 after staying in the town with friends. A photo of Houchin released by police after he went on the run in 1993 . Houchin narrowly avoided a death sentence for the murder, because he was sentenced just seven days after capital punishment was abolished. Following his release from his first prison stretch on licence, his life sentence was reimposed in 1979 for the rape. His sentence was increased after he went on the run . in 1993, when he escaped from guards while visiting his sickly father in a south London hospice. Houchin convinced officers to leave him alone and remove his handcuffs so he could have one last 'intimate moment' with his father, before disappearing. During his two weeks at large police warned Houchin was 'charming but dangerous' and 'should not be approached'. On his recapture he was sent to Belmarsh Prison, where he was beaten by three prisoners with a battery in a sock after they discovered he was a sex offender. In April 2006, he was transferred to open conditions at HMP North Sea Camp in Lincolnshire after the risk he posed to the public was assessed as 'medium'. In 2010 he won a controversial High Court battle to be switched to a more comfortable prison with less security. But a senior officer later decided he remained 'high risk' and he was moved back to a more secure jail. Houchin then sought damages from Lincolnshire probation service, claiming he became 'stressed and anxious' after being taken back into stricter conditions. He claimed his liberty was restricted, he was forced to share a cell with a smoker and lost his appetite. Victim's . charity Support After Murder and Manslaughter have expressed concerns that he may still . be dangerous because of his history of crime. Chief Executive Rose Dixon said: 'I cannot believe they are letting this guy out with the history of violence he has. 'I understand prison staff had concerns about him in the past and I cannot understand why he has been released.' Among Britain's longest-serving prisoners are Moors murderer Ian Brady, 76, who is still serving the three life sentences he was given in 1966, and Harry Roberts, 77, who was also locked up in 1966 for the murder of three policemen in London.","Alan Houchin was jailed for life after killing one teenager and raping another .

"State police were trying to calculate the exact weight of a too-heavy water tanker that caused the deck of a historic bridge to partially collapse in Pittsburgh. The tanker truck owned by Bucccaneer Enterprises of Buckhannon, W.Va., partially fell through the 136-year-old Pollocks Mills Bridge in Greene County on Sunday night. The bridge spans Ten Mile Creek between Morgan and Jefferson townships. The driver, identified as Jason Wayne Strawderman, 38, of Beverly, W.Va., told police he didn’t see a weight limit when his GPS led him across the bridge, which has a 4-ton weight limit. A representative of Buccaneer told a trooper the water tank itself holds a maximum of 4,200 gallons, though a company representative does not believe the truck was filled to capacity, according to the Washington Observer-Reporter. Too heavy: This water tanker could have weighed up to 17,500 tons. The Pollocks Mills Bridge in Greene County, Pittsburgh, can only carry 4 tons . Lucky escape: The driver managed to dump the load of fresh water the truck was carrying, potentially stopping it from crashing into the creek below . Historic: The truss bridge was built in 1878 and spans the Ten Mile Creek near Clarksville . The truck was hauling water to a natural gas drilling site owned by EQT, for whom Buccaneer is a subcontractor. The tanker holds up to 4,200 gallons — which alone would weigh more than 17 tons — though the company has said the tractor-tanker wasn’t completely full. The truck was removed Monday. A 65-ton tow truck and 45-ton Peterbilt Slider tow had to be used in tandem to pull the truck off the bridge, according to the Washington Observer-Reporter. The removal required a temporary gas shut off by People’s Natural Gas Co. to a line that crossed the bridge and supplies gas to about 4,500 residents, a gas company spokesman said. Greene County Chief Clerk Jeffrey Marshall told the Observer-Reporter that inspectors will determine whether the bridge can be repaired, and that the county will seek damages from Buccaneer Enterprises Inc. of Buckhannon, W.Va., owners of the truck, for reimbursement of repair costs. Damage: A gas line that runs alongside the bridge had to be turned off as a result of the incident . Steel beams were welded to the ends of the bridge Monday afternoon as a safety precaution to prevent anyone from entering it. Mr. Strawderman, 38, of Beverly, W.Va., told the Observer-Reporter that his GPS led him to the 136-year-old bridge and he did not see any weight restriction signs for the bridge. Mr. Strawderman said the truck, bound for the Nicoloff, EQT well site on Pollocks Mill Road, was loaded with fresh water. Buccaneer is a subcontractor of EQT. It is not known how long it will take to repair the major damage done to the bridge.

"Paul Miller, 57, was suspended by his NHS trust  after dozens of cancer patients 'came to harm' Dozens of cancer patients, including five who have since died, ‘came to harm’ after alleged mistreatment by a hospital doctor. Now 1,200 more people treated by the consultant have been sent letters asking if they have concerns about their care. Paul Miller, 57, was suspended by his NHS trust in December and has now been dismissed. The surgeon remains on suspension from a private hospital and the General Medical Council has temporarily banned him from treating urology cancer patients, pending further investigations. A panel of experts found that 27 patients, many of them elderly, ‘came to harm because of the treatment they received under [Mr Miller’s] care’ between 2006 and 2013, including five who have since died, Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust said. The trust runs the East Surrey Hospital in Redhill, where Mr Miller worked. A ‘small number of patients’ there received treatment below the hospital’s standards but were not harmed, it added. The NHS trust has written to 1,200 further prostate and bladder cancer patients treated by Mr Miller following a clinical review by the Royal College of Surgeons. Mr Miller refused to comment on the allegations ‘due to patient confidentiality’. But he added: ‘I am extremely disappointed that the trust has decided to dismiss me. I strongly do not believe this is justified. ‘I welcome the opportunity to cooperate with any investigation into my practice. My priority as a consultant for the last 21 years has always been to protect patients’ best interests and safety.’ The General Medical Council has banned Mr Miller from seeing cancer patients. He must notify the GMC of any medical work he undertakes and inform any new employer of the allegations against him. Des Holden, Surrey and Sussex NHS Trust’s medical director, said: ‘On behalf of the trust, I apologise unreservedly for the errors in these patients’ treatment . . . The outcome of the clinical review and the content of the letters will be deeply distressing to our patients and their families and I am very sorry.’ Mr Holden told BBC Radio Surrey that concerns were first raised by a doctor and a group of nurses last November. Surrey and Sussex NHS Trust which runs East Surrey Hospital, where Mr Miller worked, said 27 patients, many of them elderly, 'came to harm' under his care . He said: ‘There have been five deaths in the 27 patients . . . This is a cancer that predominantly affects very elderly people. ‘It’s a factor, but it wouldn’t be correct to say they died as a consequence of the mismanagement.’ Michael Wilson, the trust’s chief executive, said that Mr Miller had not ‘followed the advice of multi- disciplinary teams in carrying out established and recognised cancer treatments’. Mr Miller also worked at the private Spire Gatwick Park Hospital in Horley, Surrey. Its director, John Crisp, said: ‘Spire suspended Mr Miller in December 2013 as soon as the trust notified us of their investigation into Mr Miller. We are reviewing the notes of Mr Miller’s patients.’ The NHS trust has written to 1,200 further prostate and bladder cancer patients treated by Mr Miller following a clinical review by the Royal College of Surgeons . Mr Miller, who qualified in 1983, has won ‘numerous awards’ and taught at the Royal College of Surgeons and the Institute of Urology. He worked in Adelaide, Australia, and in Los Angeles before becoming clinical director of surgery at East Surrey Hospital from 1995 to 1997, then specialising in urology. He is also a director of five private health companies. Spire Gatwick Park, the NHS trust and the Royal College of Surgeons are carrying out a clinical review of his practice.","Paul Miller, 59, was suspended by Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust .

"A small, finely carved stone female head has been unearthed by archaeologists in South Shields. The face is said to represent Roman goddess Brigantia -  who was once worshipped on the banks of the Tyne - and has been buried for more than 1,800 years. It was discovered by a volunteer on the community archaeology project WallQuest at Arbeia Roman fort in the north eastern town. The face (pictured) is said to represent Roman goddess Brigantia - who was worshipped on the banks of the Tyne -  and has been buried for more than 1,800 years. The eyes, nose, mouth and hairstyle are all delicately carved, and traces of pink paint still survive on the statue’s face, and red on her lips . The eyes, nose, mouth and hairstyle are all delicately carved, and traces of pink paint still survive on the statue’s face. There are also traces of red paint on the lips. On the stone's head is a mural crown, carved into the form of a town wall with battlements, symbolising that Brigantia was a so-called ‘protecting goddess’. Brigantia was goddess of the Brigantes - a tribe whose territory included what is now the North East. A statue of Brigantia was found near Dumfries in southern Scotland in 1731, and also wears a mural crown. Evidence that this northern goddess was worshipped at South Shields was also found when an altar dedicated to her was discovered in 1895 - only 328ft (100 metres) away from where the current discovery was made.

The head will go on display at Arbeia Museum in the spring, following conservation work. There will also be an opportunity for volunteers to join the WallQuest project at Arbeia and help look for the other missing parts of the statue. Alex Croom, keeper of archaeology at Tyne Wear Archives and Museums, said: ‘The Romans believed that every place had a deity which looked after that location and perhaps they thought Brigantia must be the one. ‘The statue would have been painted and part of a shrine.’ Other representations of gods found at South Shields include Mercury and Mars. Archaeologist Dr Clive Waddington will give two lectures on 19 October, at the Jubilee Hall in Rothbury. He will discuss recent excavation he led at Low Hauxley overlooking Druridge Bay near Amble. The dig came about because cliff face erosion at Low Hauxley meant that a Bronze Age burial site was in danger of being lost. The dig revealed evidence of what may have been an early prehistoric tsunami event, burial cists and an Iron Age house rebuilt in Roman times.","The stone head was discovered at Arbeia Roman Fort in South Shields .

"Fashion stores like Marks & Spencer and Next have been unable to shift winter coats and boots because of an Indian summer that has stretched into October. M&S is expected to report worse than expected clothing and footwear sales next month after it was caught out by one of the warmest autumns in a century. The pattern follows similar warnings issued by Next and the N Brown Group, which is an online retailer, while both John Lewis and H&M said the warmer weather has had an impact on sales. Honor Westnedge, lead analyst at Verdict, a retail consultancy, said fashion giants have lost out because they failed to have sufficient stocks of T-shirts and warm weather dresses to match the hotter than expected temperatures. Scroll down for video . Marks & Spencer and Next have been unable to shift winter coats and boots because of an Indian summer that has stretched into October . She said they need to watch the weather more carefully to tailor what they put on their shelves, rather than stick rigidly to seasonal traditions. The problem this year is that many retailers began putting winter coats and knitwear in their windows and on their shelves in September at a time when much of the country was bathed in sunshine. Miss Westnedge said: ‘We've known an Indian summer was coming since June, yet the high-street retailers did not react quickly enough. ‘The retailers need to think about pre-empting this weather with transitional stock to carry them through until the consumer wants that heavier garment.’ September was among the warmest Britain has seen over the last 100 years and the temperature gauge in central England hit an average of 15.3C, which was higher than August. It was the warmest September since 2006 and also the driest since records began in 1910, which hit sales of wet weather gear, such as macs, trench coats and boots. The warm weather continued into early October, forcing retailers, including M&S, to make significant price cuts on autumn and winter ranges. Current deals at M&S include a 58per cent price cut on the Per Una Pure Cotton Bodysensor Coated Herringbone Mac with Stormwear, which is down to £35.99, and a Buttonsafe Pure Cotton Trench Mac with Stormwear, which is half price at £42.99. Among the savings on woollens, is the Per Una Speziale Wool Rich Kimono Jumper with Cashmere, which is down almost 60per cent to £52.99. M&S is expected to report worse than expected clothing and footwear sales next month after it was caught out by one of the warmest autumns in a century (Roundhay Park in Leeds on Saturday) It was the warmest September since 2006 and also the driest since records began in 1910, which hit sales of wet weather gear, such as macs, trench coats and boots . Retail analyst, Richard Hyman, said: ‘Trying to sell coats and warmer autumn and winter clothing to people who are in T-shirts and enjoying the sunshine has clearly been extremely challenging.’ Analysts at stockbrokers Citi say they expect general merchandise sales at M&S in the three months to September 29 to be down by four per cent on the same period last year, which is worse than the one per cent previously expected. As a result, it has cut its forecast for the company’s full-year profit by 1.5per cent to £650m. Next recently warned that if the warm weather continued into October – as it has – this would inevitably have an impact on its profits. This would take them below the previously expected prediction of £775m-£815m. Retailers are praying for a return to real autumn weather, however it seems that after some wind and rain across England and Wales in the next few days, temperatures will climb again by the weekend. A warm air flow from Southern Spain is expected to provide three days of balmy weather for much of Britain late next week. An autumnal mini-heatwave is set to kick off next Friday and temperatures could climb to around 21C in much of Southern England, the Midlands, East Anglia and South and East Wales. Highs in the South East may hit 22C (71.6F) next weekend, which is way above the 16C average maximum for London in October. The mild weather will also extend to the North East where the mercury could touch 20C (68F) compared to a monthly average high of just 13C in Newcastle.","Retail giants have seen profits damaged by never-ending summer .

"A pensioner whose car mounted the pavement and killed a woman out walking her dog claims she was suffering a diabetic episode at the time, a court heard. Anne Cole, 69, denied causing the death of pedestrian Hazel I'Anson by careless driving, and says the sudden onset of hypoglycemia had left her incapable of controlling her car. As Cole approached a mini-roundabout, her vehicle failed to give way to a tipper truck on her right and then accelerated, swerving up on to the pavement and knocking Mrs I'Anson high into the air, a jury was told. Anne Cole denies causing death by dangerous driving claiming she suffered a 'diabetic episode' A witness said the 51-year-old crashed down on to the windscreen before being thrown face first into a wall. Jeremy Grout-Smith, prosecuting, said Cole was involved in a 'near-miss' at another mini-roundabout moments earlier when she also failed to give way. The driver in that incident, who was brake heavily, said she was just staring straight ahead and did not make any eye contact. At the second roundabout in Leyland, Lancashire the tipper truck driver also had to brake suddenly as Cole drove across in front of him. Witness Sean Smith, who had his wife and daughter in the car with him, saw the vehicle swerve off to the left and up on to the pavement where Mrs I'Anson had no chance to get out of the way. 'It was like the roundabout wasn't there. 'We got out of the car and ran over. 'Mrs I'Anson was breathing, but only shallow. Another man came along and started CPR.' Preston Crown Court, pictured, heard that the pensioner 'was totally incapable due to lack of blood sugar' Mr Grout-Smith told the jury at Preston Crown Court: 'Mrs Cole's defence is that she suffers from diabetes and she was having a hypoglycemic episode at the time. 'She was totally incapable due to a lack of blood sugar.' The trial continues.

"Four suspected illegal immigrants have been detained after reportedly hanging on to the top of a lorry as it drove along a motorway. Kent Police were called to the London-bound carriageway of the M20 at 12.15pm today following reports of suspected migrants on the vehicle. It is understood the driver pulled over after seeing an arm hanging down from the roof of his lorry as he drove along the motorway. Police were notified and the lorry parked up on the hard shoulder to await their arrival. Police were called to the M20 in Kent after four men suspected of being illegal immigrants were seen sitting on top of a lorry . The men have been detained and Kent Police say they will now be handed over to immigration authorities . The motorway - the main route between the Channel Tunnel and London - was closed near Ashford while police removed the men, said to be of 'Middle Eastern appearance'. The lorry stopped 12 miles from the exit of the Channel Tunnel and around 15 miles from the Port of Dover, where ferries arrive from France. A Kent Police spokesman said: 'Kent Police was called at 12.15pm today to a report of some suspected illegal immigrants on the M20. 'Officers attended the London-bound carriageway at junction 9 and four people have been detained. The immigration authorities will duly be informed.' Last month, 13 suspected illegal immigrants, believed to be from Ethiopia, were detained after being spotted running from the back of a lorry on a busy motorway. Rush-hour traffic had to be slowed between junctions 12 and 13 of the M25 as Surrey Police dealt with the incident on September 22. Just four days earlier, a man was arrested for alleged 'facilitation offences' after 24 Eritrean nationals were discovered in the rear of an HGV in Whitfield, near Dover, Kent. Police arrived at the scene and closed the motorway but had to wait for firemen to arrive to remove the men . The incident caused huge tailbacks on the motorway, which runs from the Channel Tunnel to London . The latest discovery comes a day after riot police were called to the French port of Calais as more than 400 immigrants tried to storm lorries bound for the UK. French police used tear gas and batons to disperse the crowd but chiefs admitted some illegal immigrants may have got onto lorries during the disturbance. A Home Office spokesman said: 'We work closely with the police to tackle illegal immigration and continue to strengthen the security of our border to stop those who have no right to enter the UK. 'If people have a genuine need of protection they should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. 'If they are just seeking to evade immigration control they need to know that they are risking their lives and that they will get caught. 'The new Immigration Act makes it harder for people to live in the UK illegally. 'It makes it harder for illegal immigrants to abuse our benefits and public services, and makes it easier for us to remove them by reducing the number of appeals.'","Police called to M20 in Kent shortly after midday after men seen on lorry .

"A man lost at sea for two days was found clinging to a foam cooler in the Pacific Ocean. Discovered just off the coast of Colombia, the man had apparently gone out fishing with a companion on the Friday, October 31. Two days later, they had capsized and the man was sent drifting into the open ocean for two days. Colombian Navy found 47-year-old missing fisherman Solano Salazar floating on a portable icebox . The man had set out on with a companion on October 31 and two days later, their boat had capsized . This video from the Colombian Navy shows the exact moment when coast guard sailors, who were running drills in the area, found the man floating in the water. They managed to rescue the castaway, soon identified as Solano Salazar, and transfer him to hospital. He is expected to make a full recovery. The man was sent adrift for 48 hours, before the Coast Guard found him while running routine drills . Thankfully, they were able to rescue the dehydrated man and take him to Malaga Hospital . 'The person was rescued and taken to Malaga Hospital,' the commander of Colombia's Pacific Coast Guard, Captain Andres Mejia, said in the video. 'He was given first aide. He was dehydrated and according to what he said, they left (port) on Friday from the Guapi area to fish with another person and they were turned over in bad weather. 'He drifted tied to a portable cooler.' According to the man, the pair had set out from the Guapi area, but had turned over when they hit bad weather .

"A woman who lured a school girl into prostitution was back in jail today after she was captured following a nationwide hunt. Leanne Gilder, 28, formerly of Chadderton in Manchester, was jailed for five years for selling the sexual services of the 14-year-old from the back of a van. Ms Gilder, who forced the girl to take cocaine before bringing her into Manchester's red light area, was freed last month after serving just two and a half years of her sentence. Leanne Gilder failed to tell police of her whereabouts under the terms of a Sex Offenders Prevention Order . She checked into a hostel in Preston, Lancs, and was obliged to notify the police of any change of address under the terms of a Sex Offenders Prevention Order (SOPO). But within 24 hours Ms Gilder left the premises and failed to tell officers of her whereabouts. Police had been hunting for her since the weekend and tracked her down last night in Peaches massage parlour on Cookson Street, Blackpool. Ms Gilder today admitted breaching the terms of her release before a sitting of Blackpool Magistrates. District Judge Alexandra Simmons said: 'You may have had problems at the hostel but you ran knowing you were going to be in breach of the SOPO which is there to protect the public after you committed an extremely serious offence for which you were jailed.' 'You showed a complete disregard for your obligations.' Patrick Nelligan, defending, said: 'Some of the rules of the hostel in Preston caused her problems. She was not allowed alcohol.' Police last night tracked down the Ms Gilder in Peaches massage parlour (pictured on right) in Blackpool . 'She has a great fear of going back to prison and she failed to tell police where she was going and just dug herself into a serious position where the only thing that was going to happen was going back to prison - the very thing she fears the most.' Ms Gilder was convicted of the child prostitution offence in May 2012. Manchester Crown Court had heard how she forced the 14-year-old girl to take cocaine before taking her into Manchester city centre to sell her for sex. After she was released last month, she had tried to evade officers by dying her blonde hair black. Judge Simmons today ordered Ms Guilder back into custody and added eight weeks to her five-year sentence.","Leanne Gilder, 28, was freed after serving half of a five year jail term .

"Max Clifford arranged for two topless models to greet Morecambe and Wise producer Ernest Maxim when he arrived at his office, a court has heard. Celebrity agent Alan Field said Clifford had arranged the prank as 'a bit of fun', adding that Mr Maxim - who rented central London office space from the publicist in the early 1980s - was used to Clifford's 'strong and robust sense of humour.' Earlier the court heard a former employee who had a year-long affair with Clifford say she had never seen him behaving inappropriately with women. Clifford, 70, is standing trial at . Southwark Crown Court accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against . seven girls and women - all of which he denies. Claims: Agent Alan Field said Max Clifford (pictured outside Southwark Crown Court this morning) arranged for two topless models to greet Morecambe and Wise producer Ernest Maxim when he arrived at his office . Mr Field, who represented the late . comedian Lennie Bennett, described how Clifford arranged for the topless . women to greet Mr Maxim. 'Max . found the women to do that... The arrangement was made that we would . have a bit of fun with Ernest Maxim when he arrived,' he said. 'When . he arrived, he was very nonchalant and casually walked in over to the . ladies... In a very English manner, he picked up their hands and kissed . them and told them what a pleasure it was to meet them,' Mr Field added. Describing Mr Maxim as 'one of the chaps' and 'very good fun', he added: 'He completely ignored the situation that was in front of him.' Mr Field said both he and Clifford had a 'strong and robust sense of humour' and would play jokes on each other. Stars: Alan Field said Mr Maxim, who worked with comedy legends Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise (pictured here with singer Barbara Law) reacted nonchalantly to being greeted by two topless women . He . told how he encouraged the publicist to use random words including . 'tiddles' and 'Fatty Arbuckle' when he appeared on Newsnight to discuss . the supermodel Naomi Campbell. But he denied that the jokes were 'dares'. Appearing . for the defence, Mr Field described how the atmosphere a Clifford's New . Bond Street HQ was 'quite funny and light', but insisted he had never . seen the publicist do anything 'inappropriate or untoward'. The . agent also said he had never witnessed Clifford behave inappropriately . towards a female, and when asked to describe his character said: 'I . would say you wouldn't want for a better friend... He was a kind and . very generous man. 'I knew . him to be very charitable which he didn't want to be known for, he did . it all in his own private way, and a good father,' he added. Joke: Alan Field said he once encouraged Max Clifford (left) to use random words including 'tiddles' and 'Fatty Arbuckle' when he appeared on Newsnight to discuss the supermodel Naomi Campbell (right) Earlier . a former lover of Clifford told the court she was 'not comfortable' about their relationship as the publicist had made it clear he was . already married and had no intention of leaving his wife. The . former personal assistant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said . that although she was having an affair with Clifford, she always found . him to be 'kind, caring, very funny' and never saw him acting . inappropriately with women. The witness, who used to work at Clifford’s New Bond Street office in central London, said she had been in love with the publicist, but added that the year-long relationship ended when she left the company. She says she was in her late teens when she started a relationship with Clifford a year after she began working at his office. The witness said the office atmosphere was 'jokey' and 'light hearted' but she never saw him behave inappropriately towards women. She added that a host of famous celebrities - including the late TV presenter Paula Yates, The Boomtown Rats and comedian Lennie Bennett - would often drop into the offices. Mr Field denied he had 'dared' Clifford to use the random words on television in reference to Naomi Campbell, saying he had simply 'encouraged' the publicist . Asked by defence barrister Richard Horwell QC if the relationship had been sexual, the woman replied: 'Yes... My memory is we went to a hotel on occasions.' 'I can only speak from professional experience how he was with me - kind, caring, thoughtful and generous,' she added. 'He . told me right at the beginning he was married and he would not leave . his wife. He also asked if I was sure... that I wanted to enter this . relationship.' The woman said she went to Clifford’s . home on occasions and once babysat his daughter shortly after she . started working with him. Asked . by the prosecution if she was embarrassed meeting . Clifford’s wife when she came to the office, the woman paused for a few moments before replying: 'Clearly I’m not comfortable about . the fact I had a relationship with Max.' Max Clifford arrives at Southwark Crown Court today. He is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault . But . the woman added that the relationship had been 'very important' to her, . adding that the couple had gone on holiday together to Paris. Asked about the nature of their relationship, she replied: 'We would go out for dinner and he would take me out for lunch a couple of times during the week and perhaps go to a film... Just very normal in, I suppose, unusual circumstances.' The relationship ended when she stopped working at Clifford’s office, the witness said. 'We . both realised it was perhaps best I leave and work somewhere else... It took me quite a long time to get over my feelings for Max Clifford.' The witness was questioned about the size of Clifford’s penis. The . court has heard claims that Clifford has a 'micro-penis' measuring two . and half inches, while one woman told the court it was 'enormous'. A doctor had measured Clifford’s penis at five and a quarter inches long when flaccid, the jury has been told. The woman said: 'I can only say it was normal. It was such a long time ago.' She told the court she never attended any 'sex parties' with Clifford and she did not have sex with him in his office. Asked why she never had sex with Clifford in the office, she said: 'It . was never suggested to me and it wouldn't have been something that I . wanted to do.' The woman also rubbished claims Clifford's HQ was his own personal 'sexual . fiefdom' - insisting she never saw him or anyone else naked or having . sex there. The . witness said she kept in contact with Clifford after she stopped . working at his office, adding: 'I think the fondness just remained.' Wearing . a grey blazer and pink shirt, Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, . listened to the proceedings from with the dock with the aid of a hearing . loop. Busy: The witness said a host of famous celebrities - including the late TV presenter Paula Yates (left), The Boomtown Rats, and the late comedian Lennie Bennett (right) - would often drop into the offices . Jurors earlier heard that married father-of-one Clifford had cheated on his first wife Liz with at least four women. He had an affair with another one of his secretaries, a French model named as Anne Marie, and a TV dancer named Vicky. The witness said she knew about some but not all of the affairs. She also revealed that Clifford called once her using the alias 'Terry Denton' to check she was trustworthy. 'Shortly after I started work for Max Clifford I received a phone call from somebody named Terry Denton,' she said. 'I can't remember exactly how the phone call worked out, but I discovered it was to make sure that I could be relied upon to be discrete... The client information was confidential, and this was a way of Max checking. 'Max told me it was him and that client confidentiality was crucial and it was his way of making sure that I could be relied upon.' The trial continues.

"Hannah: The Robinson family who's one-year-old daughter Hannah (above) suffers many life-threatening diseases claim thieves stole their baby's story and began a phony fundraising page to raise $10,000 . Sick thieves stole photos of a seriously-ill baby to set up fake fundraiser page to receive $10,000, according to the child's family. In May, the Robinson family created a GoFundMe page called 'Hannah's Fight' with the goal of raising $250,000 for their baby, Hannah Robinson. Hannah was born seven weeks premature and suffers from Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, bowel disease, and other health issues involving her skin and heart, according to their GoFundMe page. So far, their campaign has raised more than $13,000, but took a hit when the family discovered that someone had been running a phony 'Hannah's Fight' campaign on Kickstarter -- another fundraising website -- and raised $10,000, the family reported. The family posted the news Saturday on their GoFundMe page as well as the campaign's Facebook profile. The page has since been taken down.

The family says that Hannah will be on medication for the rest of her life and those medications cost more than $800 per month. She will need between seven and nine surgeries to 'fix her issues,' according to the family, and will have to undergo plastic surgery when she is older.

Collins only retweeted a tweet on Twitter in an effort to gain support for the sick child, but many of the campaign's supporters attacked the campaign for associating with an accused child molester, TMZ reports. TMZ reports that Denver said that he deleted Collins' tweet after being bombarded by angry Hannah supporters who hated that Collins had any involvement in the campaign.","The Robinson family who's one-year-old daughter Hannah suffers many life-threatenening diseases claim thieves stole their baby's story and began a phony fundraising page where they raised $10,000 .

"Allegations: Eric Schneiderman, 59, has admitted to using marijuana and cocaine during his youth but denied taking any illegal drug since he entered the Senate in 1999 . New York's Attorney General is facing fresh questions over his alleged partying lifestyle after a political activist claimed he snorted cocaine in the backroom of a bar while serving as a state senator. Eric Schneiderman, 59, has admitted to using marijuana and cocaine during his youth but denied taking any illegal drug since he entered the Senate in 1999. However, Democratic activist and comedian Randy Credico has claimed in his memoir that he witnessed Schneiderman snort 'bumps' of cocaine during a party at Manhattan's Siberia nightclub in 2005. 'I saw him, Schneiderman, put it up his nose, a white powder' insisted Credico in a memoir he hopes to publish, according to the New York Post. The pair worked together during the 2000s in successfully reforming The Rockefeller Drug Laws - state statutes that deal with the sale and possession of 'narcotic' drugs. The alleged incident happened, Credico claimed, during a reception for politicians and their supporters. Siberia has since shut down. 'Schneiderman was there, and everybody was using like a bump or two bumps of cocaine . . . We were all snorting there, everyone was in the back room using white powder,' contended Credico, who received more than 20,000 votes as a long-shot candidate in the Democratic primary for governor last month. He claimed there were about a dozen other people in the room but could not recall who they were, the Post stated. Credico, who was such good friends with Scheiderman at the time that he even MC'd his 50th birthday party. But he says he decided to make his accusations public after seeing a recent re-election campaign advert in which Schneiderman lauds his role in 'breaking up statewide drug-trafficking rings.' He went on: 'The AG is going after Mickey Mouse drug offenders . . . when he was once totally opposed to the drug laws,' Credico allegedly wrote. Claims: However, Democratic activist and comedian Randy Credico has claimed in his memoir that he witnessed Schneiderman snort 'bumps' of cocaine during a party at Manhattan's Siberia nightclub in 2005 . Peter Adjemian, a spokesman for Schneiderman, called the allegation 'categorically false.' 'The attorney general and Mr. Credico crossed paths a number of times during 2005, when they were both supporting [Manhattan] District Attorney [Robert] Morgenthau's re-election campaign, and Mr. Credico performed stand-up comedy at the attorney general's 50th birthday party,' the rep said. 'But what's truly laughable — and absolutely, unequivocally false — is the notion that these two individuals ever did drugs together.'","Eric Schneiderman has admitted drug use in youth but denied any since .

"A Texas couple believe they've captured the legendary 'goat sucker' beast el chupacabra. Jackie Stock and her husband Bubba discovered the hairless, growling creature eating corn outside their Ratcliffe home on Sunday and decided it could be but one thing. 'He called me to come and look, and I said ""Bubba that looks like a baby chupacabra,”' Stock said. Scroll down for video . Is this El Chupacabra? A Texas couple found this mysterious creature in their yard on Sunday and believe it is a legendary chupacabra . 'He called me to come and look, and I said ""Bubba that looks like a baby chupacabra,¿' said Jackie Stock after her husband first happened on the creature . Indeed, the animal is not very large--perhaps the size of a house cat. But its wrinkly black skin and bulbous eyes still lend it a look of menace. The couple have kept the thing in a cage and have been feeding it and making sure it has water to drink. They've also given friends and neighbors the opportunity to come take a peek. Neighbor Arlen Parma spoke from experience when he concluded it's likely the blood sucking chupacabra. 'I hunted coons for 20 years with dogs and I ain’t ever seen anything that looks like that right there,' Parma told KAVU. 'We've never seen anything like it before': The couple has kept the animal around in order to show it around in hopes someone can ID it . Jackie Stock shows where she first happened on the animal she thinks is a chupacabra . 'I hunted coons for 20 years with dogs and I ain’t ever seen anything that looks like that right there,' said the Stocks' neighbor Arlen Parma . And his identification wasn't just based on looks: . 'A coon doesn’t make that noise, or a possum. What makes that noise? I guess a chupacabra does,' Parma said. Stock and her husband say they have kept the animal in a cage, not to harm it, but out of curiosity. 'We were just trying to figure out what it is because we've never seen anything like it before,' Stock said. No chupacabra has ever been positively identified, of course, and if the Stock's find is ever ID'd, it will likely be as a mammal, possibly with a parasitic infestation that has caused its hair to fall out. The Stocks are feeding the animal and making sure it has plenty of water . Mangy? Many believe chupacabra sightings are nothing more than mammals like foxes or raccoons with hair loss caused by mange . LEGEND OF EL CHUPACABRA . The word comes from two Spanish words - 'chupar', to suck, and 'cabra', goat. The first reported sighting was In 1995, when eight sheep were found dead in Puerto Rico with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood. Thus, the legend of the livestock killing, vampire-like chupacabra was born. Since then, the legendary beast has been spotted across the Americas and even the world. A Mexican incident where 35 sheep were found mysteriously dead was blamed on El Chupacabra in 2012. Earlier this year, yet another Mississippi sighting came when a Leake County man actually shot and killed what he claimed was El Chupacabra. Even a Belarusian town had a Chupacabra sighting this past July . SCIENCE ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN . Scientists often speculate that hairless creatures believed to be El Chupacabra are actually wildlife like coyotes, foxes, and stray dogs infested with parasites. Most commonly pointed to is the parasite Sarcoptes scabiei, which causes mange. Mange is a painful, potentially life threatening condition which can cause complete hair loss in mammals and can also cause their skin to shrivel, making for an even more ghoulish looking beast. In humans, Sarcoptes scabiei causes scabies and a consequent itchy, painful rash as the parasites burrow around, leaving their feces under the skin. 'Goat . sucker': The legend of El Chupacabra likely originates from a 1995 case . in Puerto Rico where 8 sheep were found dead with puncture wounds. It . has been described as hairless, or as having spines along its back, and . as having blue or red eyes .","A man in Ratcliffe, Texas has caught a smallish, black critter that he believes is the legendary beast .

"Traumatised: Michelle Goodhall, 35, who has just 12 months to live, was targeted by teenage home-raiders twice in three days . A terminally-ill mother has been targeted twice in three days by teenage burglars - who stole £7,000 cash she had been saving to pay for her funeral. Michelle Goodhall, 35, was left traumatised after the two boys stormed into her home and took the money, which was hidden in her bedroom. Less than 48 hours later, the thugs broke into the property again, slamming Mrs Goodall's head against a wall during the raid before fleeing when she called for her daughter Laura, 14, who was upstairs. The wheelchair-bound mother-of-two, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, has just 12 months left to live as her respiratory system is shutting down. She was given the dire prognosis six months ago after an unsuccessful double lung transplant to treat her emphysema. On hearing the the news from doctors, she decided she would keep some money away so that she could be given a proper send-off. She said: 'My husband John had just popped out to pick up a takeaway and I thought it was my daughter and a friend. 'Suddenly I heard this tremendous crashing and banging. 'I was scared it was a burglar and I heard them come back down and head to the kitchen, then I heard plates being smashed on the floor. 'I was terrified as I was home alone. 'Later we found out that £7,000 we've saved for my funeral was taken - I haven't got longer than 12 months.' Her husband John said that since his wife's operation went wrong - her airways have been slowly shutting down - leaving her almost entirely wheelchair-bound and in need of an oxygen supply. Mr Goodall, 61, who is her full-time carer, added: 'On Thursday night I went out to pick some food up from a local takaway. 'Michelle had been in the toilet under the stairs when she heard people come in. She heard banging before they came downstairs and threw plates and a bowl of fruit in the kitchen before leaving. 'They were in and out within a few minutes but it was a terrifying ordeal. She rang me and my daughter and we alerted the police straight away. Tragic: The young mother was given her dire prognosis after having a double lung transplant six months ago . 'I later noticed that a case I kept on top of my wardrobe in our room had been opened and the cash we kept inside was gone. 'We were saving it for future arrangements - Michelle has just 12 months to live and has to be on oxygen when we go out.' A camcorder was also taken in the raid on the Goodhalls' family home. The couple, who also have a daughter called Nicola, 16, were still recovering from the shock of the first break-in when they were targeted again by the two teenagers on Saturday morning. Mrs Gooddall said they grabbed her head and slammed it against the wall before leaving empty- handed. Her husband added: 'We couldn't say if it was the same people, but if it was I presume they were returning to take more of our possessions. 'It all happened so quickly but she was left shocked and terrified.' The thieves have been described as male and wearing black hooded-tops. The first was described as 16-17 years, of chubby build and wearing black tracksuit bottoms and white trainers. The second was described as 14, slim and wearing grey tracksuit bottoms and white trainers. Detective Sergeant Paul Keitch, from West Yorkshire Police, said: 'It is clearly concerning that this vulnerable woman's home has been targeted twice in a short period of time, with the intruders in this latest incident also using violence against her. 'Thankfully she was not seriously hurt but nonetheless this was a frightening experience for her and it is vitally important that we identify those involved. 'We are supporting the victim and her family, which includes advising on how the property can be made more secure. 'Additional patrols are also being put in place to provide reassurance and deter any further offending.' Anyone who knows anyone about the two attacks is urged to contact the force.","Michelle Goodhall, 35, traumatised after teenagers raided home stealing cash .

"Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper empire ‘shopped their own staff’ to police in a bid to avoid corporate prosecution for phone hacking and corrupt payments, a court heard yesterday. A top lawyer at the US parent company of the News of the World and Sun newspapers described the prospect of a corporate charge as ‘apocalyptic’, threatening 46,000 jobs in America if it went bust. Yesterday Kingston Crown Court heard News Corporation’s management standards committee (MSC), set up internally to investigate business practices, believed that by handing material on individual employees to police it would save the company. But police denied any deal was done. Kingston Crown Court heard News Corporation management standards committee believed that by handing material on employees to police it would save the company . The revelation came in the trial of six senior Sun journalists accused of ‘corruption on a grand scale’ paying police, soldiers, prison and hospital staff for stories over a decade. Head of news, Chris Pharo, 45, picture editor John Edwards, 50, managing editor Graham Dudman, 51, deputy news editor Ben O’Driscoll, 38, and reporters Jamie Pyatt, 51, and John Troup, 49, are accused of conspiring to corrupt public officials, paying for information about celebrities, murderers and royals. All six deny the charges. Nigel Rumfitt QC, defending Pharo, said: ‘They (MSC) were keen to be seen to co-operate with the police.’ Detective Superintendent Mark Kandiah agreed: ‘They certainly were co-operative.’ Mr Rumfitt said: ‘In slang, they were shopping their own staff.’ The company received a letter in May 2012 from the CPS informing them a corporate liability charge was a possibility. Minutes of a meeting a month later between the MSC and police indicated committee chairman Lord Grabiner was not sure the firm would have assisted ‘if they had been told this last year’. Six senior Sun journalists are accused of ‘corruption on a grand scale’ paying police, soldiers, prison and hospital staff for stories over a decade and are on trial at Kingston Crown Court, pictured . In another meeting News Corporation lawyer Gerson Zweifach said 46,000 jobs were at risk. The minutes read: ‘It [a prosecution] could kill the corporation. This job [co-operating with police] was to defend the company... The downstream effect of a prosecution would be devastating and apocalyptic.’ Mr Rumfitt said: ‘The point he was making was if the company was charged, rather than individual employees...the company could go bust.’ The trial continues.

"gone too soon: Dammion Heard, 20, a student at Western State Colorado University, was found dead not far from from campus five days after his disappearance . A brief search for a missing collegiate wrestler ended on a tragic note Wednesday when he was found dead not far from his Colorado college campus five days after his disappearance. The body of 20-year-old Dammion Heard was discovered on Bureau of Land Management property 8 miles east of Gunnison, Colorado. His 2004 Saturn Vue was found nearby. Heard was last seen alive last Saturday in the vicinity of Western State Colorado University, where he was a freshman studying petroleum geology. The Gunnison Police Department said that no suspects are being pursued, and that the circumstances surrounding Heard's death do not pose a threat to the Western State campus. During his senior year at Fossil Ridge High School in Texas, Heard won the 2013 state wrestling title in the 113-pound weight class, The Star-Telegram reported. His high school wrestling coach Tony Lopez told the paper that Heard had been a wrestler since childhood, and that his father, Gary Heard, helped train him. Western State Colorado interim president Brad Baca released a statement Wednesday reacting to Heard's passing. 'Dammion was a vibrant and beloved member of the campus community, a great student and an accomplished athlete,' the statement read. 'Our hearts and thoughts are with his family and friends.' Triumph: Heard won a state championship title last year while competing in 113-pound weight class for his Texas school . The college held a prayer circle in Heard's honor Wednesday night, and a candle vigil will take place Monday night at Fossil Ridge High School. Those who knew the 20-year-old student athlete from Azle, Texas, were left wondering about what may have led to the tragedy. On his Facebook page, the handsome, 5-foot-7, 125-pound student appeared well-liked and popular, with dozens of photos depicting him laughing and hanging out with friends. Coach Lopez said Heard had always struck him as smart and 'calm-headed.' No foul play: Police say no suspects are being pursued, and that the circumstances surrounding Heard's death do not pose a threat to the Western State campus . Popular: Those who knew Dammion Heard described him as a well-liked, calm and intelligent young man who loved wrestling . ‘He understood wrestling,’ Lopez said. ‘He had his goals set and he knew what he had to do.’ Meanwhile, Heard's current and former classmates and wrestling partners took to Twitter to express their grief at his untimely passing. 'RIP to Dammion Heard,' tweeted Oliver Pierce. ‘Have had some awesome memories with you and your dad since the youth days! I feel sick to my stomach!’ Another friend Lorenzo Padron wrote: 'R.I.P to one of the best wrestlers I knew Dammion Heard 2x state finalist 2013 state Champ at 113.'

"Not satisfied with simply beating up a 16-year-old for his cell phone Tuesday, a group of robbers then used the stolen device to text 'I'm gay' to the victim's mother. Seattle police said the unidentified victim was waiting for his bus on Southwest Barton Street at about 4 p.m. when he was suddenly assaulted. KATU reports that the teen dropped his phone and backpack trying to defend himself. Not satisfied with simply beating up a 16-year-old for his cell phone Tuesday, a group of robbers then used the stolen device to text 'I'm gay' to the victim's mother . The group of attackers left with those items when someone yelled at them to stop the fight. The battered victim returned home to his mother who had gotten a text from his missing phone reading: 'I'm gay you know that.' The victim told authorities one attacker was a former classmate, but he was unable to identify the rest of the gang. Besides a cut on his face and a hurt tooth, he was uninjured. It could have been worse. In one case in September a stolen cell phone was used to rack up more than $500,000 in charges on one Australian man's account. Yahoo Finance reports that the cellphone carrier waived those charges after some argument from the victim. Cell phone theft has become so prevalent and potentially hurtful that The New York Daily News reported that New York State Attorney General Eric Scheiderman met with reps from Apple, Google, Motorola, Samsung, and Microsoft in 2013 to ask them to make it easier for victims to make their phones inoperable if stolen.

"The White House has insisted that the creation of its 'Cuban Twitter' programme was not a covert operation. The Obama administration defended the communications network called Zunzuneo, which drew 40,000 users in Cuba in two years, saying the programme was 'invested and debated' in Congress. But two senior Democrats on congressional and judiciary committees said they knew nothing about the effort, with one of them describing it as 'dumb, dumb, dumb.' Scroll down for video . More than 40,000 Cubans were using Zunzuneo but the White House say it was not a covert operation . It was reported that the social network, partly funded by the US Agency for International Aid (USAID), aimed to build a Cuban audience of mostly young people and sought to evade Cuba's stranglehold on the internet with a primitive social media platform. But the users were neither aware it was created by an US agency with ties to the State Department, nor that American contractors were gathering personal data about them for political purposes. Chairman of the Senate Appropriations State Department and Foreign Operations subcommittee, Senator Partick Leahy said he had no knowledge of the social media network. And he called the project 'dumb, dumb, dumb' during an appearance on MSNBC yesterday. Senator Patrick Leahy, left, said the project was 'dumb, dumb, dumb'. Zunzuneo ended abruptly in Cuba in 2012 . He added: 'I know they said we were. We were notified in the most oblique way that nobody could understand it. 'I'm going to ask two basic questions: Why weren't we specifically told about this if you're asking us for money? And secondly, whose bright idea was this anyway?' Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he too was unaware of Zunzuneo. It is unclear whether the Zunzuneo scheme was legal under U.S. law, which requires written authorization of covert action by the president as well as congressional notification. Zunzuneo was partly funded by the US Agency for International Aid and was said to be aimed at young Cubans . White House spokesman Jay Carney said he was not aware of individuals in the White House who had known about the programme. But hours later the narrative had shifted to say that the administration had offered to discuss funding for it with the congressional committees that approve federal programs and budgets. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf described the Zunzuneo scheme as 'discreet' but in no way classified or covert. She added that the project did not rise to the level that required the either the current or former secretary of state, to be informed. In his prior position as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State John Kerry had asked congressional investigators to examine whether or not U.S. democracy promotion programs in Cuba were operated according to U.S. laws, among other issues. Zunzuneo, which is slang for a Cuban hummingbird's tweet was launched in the country in 2009 . The resulting report, released by the Government Accountability Office in January 2013, does not examine whether or not the programs were covert. It does not say that any U.S. laws were broken. The GAO report does not specifically refer to Zunzuneo, but does note that USAID programs included 'support for the development of independent social networking platforms.' But the Republican chairman of a House oversight subcommittee said his panel will be looking into the project too. 'That is not what USAID should be doing,"" said Congressman Jason Chaffetz. 'USAID is flying the American flag and should be recognized around the globe as an honest broker of doing good. If they start participating in covert, subversive activities, the credibility of the United States is diminished.' It is said that the US Agency for International Aid, pictured, went to extensive lengths to conceal Washington's ties to the project . In a statement, Josefina Vidal, director of U.S. affairs at Cuba's Foreign Ministry, also criticised the latest revelations. He said 'This shows once again that the United States government has not renounced its plans of subversion against Cuba, which have as their aim the creation of situations of destabilization in our country to create changes in the public order and toward which it continues to devote multimillion-dollar budgets each year. 'The government of the United States must respect international law and the goals and principles of the United Nations charter and, therefore, cease its illegal and clandestine actions against Cuba, which are rejected by the Cuban people and international public opinion.' But several other lawmakers voiced their support for Zunzuneo, which is slang for a Cuban hummingbird's tweet. But chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said USAID should be applauded for giving people in Cuba a less-controlled platform to talk to each other . Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said USAID should be applauded for giving people in Cuba a less-controlled platform to talk to each other. Mr Menendez added: 'The whole purpose of our democracy programs, whether it be in Cuba or other parts of the world, is in part to create a free flow of information in closed societies.' USAID and its contractors went to extensive lengths to conceal Washington's ties to the project, according to interviews and documents obtained by the AP. They set up front companies in Spain and the Cayman Islands to hide the money trail, and recruited CEOs without telling them they would be working on a U.S. taxpayer-funded project. The estimated $1.6 million spent on ZunZuneo was publicly earmarked for an unspecified project in Pakistan, public government data show, but those documents don't reveal where the funds were actually spent, according to AP. Zunzuneo was launched in 2009, shortly after the arrest of Alan Gross, left. Cuban Ernesto Guerra, right described the abrupt end of the network as 'like a vacuum.' Zunzuneo was publicly launched shortly after the 2009 arrest in Cuba of American contractor Alan Gross. He was imprisoned after travelling repeatedly to the country on a separate, clandestine USAID mission to expand Internet access using sensitive technology that only governments use. USAID told the AP that ZunZuneo stopped in September 2012 when a government grant ended. 'The moment when ZunZuneo disappeared, (it) was like a vacuum,"" said Ernesto Guerra, a Cuban user who never suspected his beloved network had ties to Washington. 'In the end, we never learned what happened. We never learned where it came from.'","Administration say Zunzuneo was 'invested and debated' in Congress .

"Perhaps it was nerves before being serenaded by cross-dressing Eurovision singer Conchita Wurst, but UN chief Ban Ki-moon today fell into the trap of confusing Austria with Australia during a visit to Vienna. 'I thank in particular (Austrian) President (Heinz) Fischer and the government of Australia,' Ban told reporters at a UN conference of developing landlocked countries hosted by the Austrian capital. He later corrected himself and apologised in the news conference, saying: 'There are no kangaroos in Austria. Sometimes this happens, I hope you understand.' UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon (left) and Austrian transvestite singer Conchita Wurst pose at the United Nations headquarters in Vienna. Ki-moon today confused Austria with Australia during a speech . Later, Wurst raised the roof for Ban and several hundred UN staff, belting out Cher's 'Believe' and 'Rise Like a Phoenix', the song the bearded drag queen sang to win the Eurovision Song Contest earlier this year. Wurst has used her Eurovision fame to promote a message of tolerance, with performances in front of the European Parliament and at LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) events around Europe. Ban paid tribute to her efforts, saying: 'I will continue to fight against transphobia and homophobia. I will stand strong for equality. I hope more of you join our global 'Free and Equal' campaign.' In an ankle-length blue dress and black high heels, Wurst, 25, said to cheers: 'I dream of a future where we won't have to talk about sexual orientation, the colour of your skin, your religious beliefs.' Wurst raised the roof for Ban and several hundred UN staff, belting out Cher's 'Believe' and 'Rise Like a Phoenix', the song the bearded drag queen sang to win the Eurovision Song Contest . This week's UN conference of landlocked developing countries brings together 32 nations with a combined population of 450 million people looking at improving transportation networks and access to markets. Among those present was Robert Mugabe, the 90-year-old president of Zimbabwe, and Bolivian President Evo Morales. Neither attended Wurst's performance. Wurst, whose real name is Tom Neuwirth, won the 2014 song contest for Austria in May. Ban said she had turned the event, often derided for its kitsch performances, into a 'moment of human rights education' fighting for diversity and tolerance. Wurst returned home to a heroine's welcome after her song contest victory before a TV audience of about 180 million in 45 countries. At the time, she said: 'I share the opinion that this was not a victory just for me but for the people who believe in a future that works without discrimination and is based on tolerance and respect. This transcends borders.' But her victory was condemned by some social conservatives as promoting gay rights. A confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the West of trying to impose decadent values on other countries, saying Wurst symbolised its 'ethno-fascism'.","The South Korean made the gaffe when thanking the nation's president .

"Imagine plunging off an 876-foot-high bridge with only a parachute as a lifeline. Now imagine doing it in a wheelchair. That's what Lonnie Bissonnette will be doing Saturday for a second time. He even manages to stay in the wheel chair during the landing. Daredevil: Lonnie Bissonnette was left paralysed following a previous base jumping accident but still enjoys the extreme sport. The 48-year-old is pictured throwing himself off a bridge in China . Passionate: Mr Bissonnette can be seen in his wheelchair jumping from the New River Gorge. The Canadian has travelled to Norway, China and America to enjoy his hobby . Last October, Lonnie Bissonnette landed his wheelchair after going off the 876-foot-high New River Gorge Bridge during the Bridge Day festival in Fayetteville, West Virginia. He is going to repeat his feat this weekend . Tumbling: As well as base jumping, Mr Bissonnette enjoys bungee jumping.He can be seen bungee jumping off Whistler in British Columbia, Canada . Paralyzed below the waist since a 2004 parachuting accident, Bissonnette will return to southern West Virginia for another chance to launch himself on wheels from the New River Gorge Bridge. Tens of thousands of people will watch him and scores of other parachutists, zip liners and rappellers Saturday during the annual Bridge Day festival in Fayetteville. 'It's scary every single time for me,' Bissonnette said. 'And I think that's part of the lure, is the exhilaration after the jump. If I didn't have that fear before the jump, I think then the jump wouldn't be so exhilarating.' The New River Gorge Bridge, the third-highest bridge in the United States, opened in 1977. Bridge Day started three years later. BASE jumpers from around the world flock there the third Saturday of every October, the only day of the year that the bridge is open to pedestrian traffic. BASE stands for building, antenna, span and Earth, the fixed objects from which jumpers leap. Passion: Mr Bissonnette says base jumping is his life . Damaged: This shows an X-Ray of Lonnie Bissonnette's neck, right, after the accident that left him paralyzed. This X-Ray image, left, shows his knee held together with a metal plate following the accident . Fun: Mr Bissonnette can be seen on the back of another man wing suit flying off Kjerag mountain in Norway . Bissonnette, 49, has been a BASE jumper for 20 years and doesn't let anything stop him from enjoying his beloved hobby -- not even a terrible accident 10 years ago at a bridge in Twin Falls, Idaho, that left him permanently paralyzed . Matthew Kaye is a University of Vermont chemist and served with the National Guard in Afghanistan. He's made more than 300 skydives and 100 BASE jumps. And he's scared of heights. 'Horrified,' Kaye said. 'I've been shot at. I've been rocketed. Nothing spooks me more than staring over the edge of an abyss.' He's one of about 450 BASE jumpers signed up to participate. For experienced BASE jumpers looking for an extra kick, a steel catapult equipped with a seat will send some of them hurtling backward to start their journey. 'It allows them to relive their first jump all over again,' said Bridge Day jump organizer and catapult designer Jason Bell. 'You can see the fear in their eyes before launching.' Bissonnette found a way to adapt existing BASE jumping technology to his wheelchair, with a strap system that keeps the wheelchair next to him when he jumps, but allows a quick release if he has to ditch it during the fall . Taking the plunge: The extreme sports fanatic can be seen skydiving in Ontario, Canada . Extreme: Mr Bissonnette says he knows the risks involved in base jumping but carries on because it's his passion . Life on the inside: A rare moment captures Mr Bissonnette when he is on the inside of a plane and not jumping out of it! Bissonnette is making his 19th trip to Bridge Day. Ten years ago while BASE jumping in Twin Falls, Idaho, his parachute lines tangled around his foot as he was doing a flip. Despite being left paralyzed, he was BASE jumping again a year later. He began using a standard wheelchair for BASE jumping in 2010. He's made about a dozen jumps with it — some at Bridge Day and others in Austria, China, Malaysia, Spain, and Twin Falls. About half of his landings have sent him tumbling — his front wheels tend to dig into the ground and stop his momentum. Last year's Bridge Day landing, though, was perfect. 'The chair's not designed for what I put it through,' he said. 'Landing on all fours and not flipping over and crashing is difficult.' Bissonnette has added larger front wheels to help with the landing, but he'd like to find a sponsor to get a custom-made chair to withstand the punishment. 'It's pretty amazing what he does,' said Bell, adding that watching Bissonnette land safely in 2013 'was pretty neat and a lot of emotion for a lot of people.' Head for heights: The 48-year-old can be seen base jumping off Skylon Tower in Niagra Falls, Canada . Base jumpers jump off the New River Gorge Bridge in Fayetteville, West Virginia during Bridge Day . Tens of thousands of people will watch scores of parachutists, zip liners and rappellers during the annual Bridge Day festival, this Saturday in Fayetteville . Bissonnette may be an inspiration to others, but he doesn't see himself that way. In fact, the label doesn't sit well with him. 'That's never been my motive,' he said. 'For many years I would tell people that I'm nobody for anybody to be inspired by or to be looked up at. I see myself as just someone who's really passionate about what I do — and literally too stupid to quit. Because a smart guy would have given up after my accident.' Not only did Bissonnette refuse to quit, he is a daredevil on multiple levels. The resident of St. Catherines, Ontario, plans to leave after Bridge Day for Calgary to start training for competitive bobsled racing, which might become a demonstration sport at the 2018 Winter Paralympics.","Lonnie Bissonnette has jumped from bridges and cliffs .

"There was torrential rain in Swansea, a goal by Alexis Sanchez and the collapse of Arsenal’s painfully fragile defensive unit. Stop me if you’ve heard it before. Five days after his team surrendered a 3-0 lead in Europe against Anderlecht, Arsene Wenger saw another lead washed away. Only these lost points will perhaps prove even more damaging as defeat leaves Arsenal trailing a dozen points behind Barclays Premier League pacesetters Chelsea. Alexis Sanchez's (left) goal was as good as it got for Arsenal on a miserable afternoon in Wales . What a weekend it has been for Jose Mourinho and how Wenger must wonder if it would have been better to bid farewell in the afterglow of an FA Cup win at Wembley. His side struggle with familiar problems: the inability to defend a lead and the character to resist setbacks. Two clean sheets have been followed by two lost leads. For every step or two forward there is one back. The squad lacks depth in defence and the back four is being held together with sticking plaster. Regardless, Wenger maintains his footballing principles. As the Premier League breaks for international football, 11 games into the campaign, Arsenal feel too far off the pace. They are a point behind Swansea, who responded brilliantly after going behind in the 63rd minute. Garry Monk’s side were behind for 12 minutes before Gylfi Sigurdsson levelled with a superb free-kick and Bafetimbi Gomis scored in the winner, his first in the Premier League, seconds after coming on to replace Wilfried Bony. Swansea midfielder Jefferson Montero (right), seen battling with Santi Cazorla, impressed for the hosts . Swansea survived a chaotic finish and a desperate penalty appeal when a header from Yaya Sanogo skidded into Neil Taylor’s arm and, without injured wingers Nathan Dyer and Wayne Routledge and with Jonjo Shelvey suspended, they deserved their win. How they celebrated at the end, no-one more so than former Arsenal duo: goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski and centre back Kyle Bartley, starting his first Premier League game of the season. Arsenal have won just four Premier League matches this season and those have come against teams currently in the bottom seven of the table. For an hour it had been a tense struggle, littered by fouls, cautions and treatment for injuries, contrary to expectations from two fluent passing teams. Swansea had started well, Arsenal fought back and, ultimately, Wenger’s team paid the price again for their inability to close ranks and protect a lead. Ecuadorian winger Jefferson Montero tormented Calum Chambers, who has the look of a talented teenager in need of a break. Montero was too quick and direct for Chambers and created the winner with a burst of acceleration down the left wing and a perfect cross for Gomis to head in. Gylfi Sigurdsson (left) curls in a superb free-kick for Swansea's equaliser against the Gunners . Sigurdsson is congratulated by Kyle Bartley (left) and Montero (right) after his equalising goal . Monk was rewarded for refusing to flinch. Gomis was stripped and ready to come on when Sigurdsson curled his free-kick over the defensive wall and into the top corner from 25 yards, beyond the dive of Wojciech Szczesny. Wenger disputed the free-kick but it was awarded after a cynical trip by Kieran Gibbs to halt a swift counter-attack by Modou Barrow, a Gambian striker. Monk went for the kill rather than attempt to protect the point. On went Gomis as planned and he had scored within seconds, after winning the ball and linking in with his midfield. Play was swept out to the Swansea left, where Montero tore past Chambers and clipped an inviting cross towards Gomis, who climbed above Aaron Ramsey and Nacho Monreal to thump his header inside the post. Arsenal had been 15 minutes from victory but were rarely comfortable and it is hard to escape the feeling that Swansea’s refusal to give up was motivated at least in part by the fact Wenger’s team are so brittle. They can be got at. It is not a new theory but there is, it seems, a psychological weakness within a superbly gifted team, and it is costing them in the toughest competitions. Gomis rises to the occasion by leaping above the Arsenal defenders and powering a header into the net . Monk felt his team should have had an early penalty when Chambers barged into Bony as the Ivorian controlled a ball on his chest. Bony fell in a heap and there was exaggerated disbelief inside the Liberty Stadium as referee Phil Dowd ignored calls for a foul. It was the sort of reaction commonly found at the Emirates, but Monk has generated a similar feeling in South Wales, after an extended public whinge about poor decisions costing his team. Szczesny saved from Marvin Emnes, but Arsenal grew stronger as the first half progressed and their best moments revolved around Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, and his desire to run at defenders. Neil Taylor and Ki Sung-Yeung were cautioned for fouls on him and Dowd’s yellow card count was in double figures by the end. Arsene Wenger looks far from happy at the final whistle after seeing his Arsenal side surrender their lead . The top six in the Premier League, with Swansea leapfrogging Arsenal into fifth after their 2-1 win on Sunday . Fabianski thwarted Danny Welbeck, Ramsey lashed a volley close and Per Mertesacker beat Bartley to a corner only to head wide. The Polish goalkeeper, who left Arsenal after winning the FA Cup in May, also saved a skiddy drive by Santi Cazorla — but was unable to keep Sanchez at bay. Oxlade-Chamberlain broke out of defence, rode an attempted trip by Tom Carroll and found Cazorla. He released Welbeck who pulled his cross deep to Sanchez. The Chilean swept the ball into the net. It was his 12th in 14 games, but that is not where Wenger has problems. It is at the other end, where it always has been. The heavens opened and Arsenal went under. Match Zone by Riath Al-Samarrai . 1. Calum Chambers needs a rest. He’s played in 20 games this season and let Jefferson Montero — the 25-year-old Ecuador winger, who joined Swansea for £4m in July — dominate the flank. Calum Chambers had a torrid afternoon up against Swansea winger Montero . 2. Since Garry Monk’s rant about bad refereeing, Federico Fernandez’s red card was rescinded, a clear penalty wasn’t given at Everton, and it appeared Wilfried Bony was also denied one yesterday. 3. Aaron Ramsey is still showing wonderful incision, but his tally of two goals is four down on this stage last season. Arsene Wenger’s demeanour has also suggested some frustration at the player. Aaron Ramsey has struggled to recapture his form from last season for Arsenal so far this term . 4. So much for a pass-fest. Two of the most eye-catching sides in the division were involved in a fierce battle, managing 26 fouls and five bookings apiece.","Arsenal lost from a winning position for the second consecutive game .

"Two British jihadists are thought to have been among scores of prisoners handed back to Islamic State by Turkey in return for the release of diplomats. Former grammar school pupil Shabazz Suleman, 18, and Hisham Folkard, 26, are understood to be among as many as 180 fighters exchanged by Turkey in the deal. In return, the terror group has released 46 Turkish citizens and three local Iraqi staff who were captured when IS stormed the Iraqi city of Mosul five months ago. Scroll down for video . Shabazz Suleman, 18, (right) a former pupil at the Royal Grammar School in High Wycombe, and Hisham Folkardis, 26, (left) are said to be the two British jihadists who have been handed back to ISIS by Turkey . The Times has seen a leaked list of names, including the two Britons, that has been confirmed by IS sources. It is not known whether the two British men were captured by Turkish forces during fighting or whether they had been trying to escape Islamic State. Shabazz Suleman, 18, a pupil at the Royal Grammar School in High Wycombe, had reportedly given his parents the slip to cross the border while on holiday in Turkey. He had a place lined up at a top university after achieving good A-level results this summer. He had previously travelled to the Syrian border with an aid convoy last summer. The deal is understood to have been brokered through complex talks with tribes and rebel militia. Three French citizens, two Swedes, two Macedonians, one Swiss, and one Belgian are also believed to have been part of the exchange. British teacher David Bolam, 63, who has been held by militants in Libya since May has been released . The devout Roman Catholic father of Hisham Folkard, who asked not to be named, said he last had contact with his son in early August, after officers from the north-east counter-terrorism unit inquired about his elder son Omar. He told The Times: ‘I’m not surprised. I see the stories about these boys on TV every week. Of course it’s different [that it’s my son], but I hardly knew either of them. 'Their mother took them away. When she let them go to Yemen to study Islam I cut them off completely.’ It is reported that Hisham’s older brother Omar Folkard is known the security services and his passport surfaced in Mali. Detectives looking for Hisham have not ruled out that his elder brother was using his passport in Turkey. It also emerged yesterday that a British teacher held hostage by militants in Libya was released after a ransom was paid. David Bolam, 63, was abducted in May while out shopping. Last month he appeared in a harrowing video begging David Cameron to help save him but his identity was not revealed at the request of the Government. The release of Mr Bolam, from Shropshire, who is principal at the International School in Benghazi, on Thursday follows months of negotiations with the help of local political factions. Last night the Foreign Office said it did not support the payment of ransoms and was not involved in the negotiations.","Shabazz Suleman, 18, and Hisham Folkard, 36, thought to have been traded .

"Nick Griffin, the former chairman of the British National Party, has been expelled from the far right group. The BNP last night confirmed that Mr Griffin, 55, had been 'expelled from membership' amid claims that he had attempted to cause 'disunity' within the party. In a damning letter, Adam Walker, the current BNP chairman, alleged that Mr Griffin had attempted to spread 'lies' about the party and had 'harrass[ed]' current members. Scroll down for video . Expelled: Nick Griffin has been thrown out of the British National Party, which he led for several years . Chairman Adam Walker (right with Nick Griffin in 2008) said his predecessor had spread 'lies' about the party . An hour and a half after the statement was released on the party’s website, the former politician, who had led the BNP for 15 years, took to Twitter to speak out against the decision. He wrote: 'Breaking news! I’ve just been ""expelled"" without trial from the #BNP! That’ll teach me to tell a member of staff he’s a “useless, lazy t***”.' Moments later, he compared the BNP to the former Sovet Union tweeting: 'Only thing is that the ruling Wigton Soviet are operating outside the constitution so I shall ignore their plastic gangster games.' Mr Griffin stepped down from his leadership of the BNP in July this year, after losing his seat as an MEP, but was given an honorary title of President. He had declared bankruptcy months before leaving the group. Rant: The former party leader, who was declared bankrupt and lost his seat this year, broke the news online . The politician has often hit headlines following controversial comments. In May, he described the Holocaust as a 'moral club' which had been 'exploited' to block criticism of immigration. In 1997 he was handed a suspended prison sentence after being convicted of inciting racial hatred. Mr Griffin was ousted from the party following a review by its conduct committee. Mr Jefferson, a member of the committee who did not provide his first name, said: 'This has been a difficult decision to make and not one taken lightly. 'Although we all appreciate that Nick has achieved a lot for our Party in the past, we must also remember that the Party is bigger than any individual. 'Nick did not adjust well to being given the honourary title of President and it soon became obvious that he was unable to work as an equal member of the team and alarmingly his behaviour became more erratic and disruptive.'","Party claimed its honorary president, 55, became 'erratic and disruptive'

"A jury has been shown intimate photographs of murderer Jodi Arias that were taken by Travis Alexander in the hours leading up to his death. While prosecutors have now closed their case in the sentencing retrial of Arias - convicted of murdering her ex-boyfriend - their evidence required jurors to sit through several days of lurid evidence involving intimate photos and phone-sex recordings. Arias was convicted of the murder of her ex-boyfriend last year, but a retrial was ordered after the jury was deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty or life in prison. Scroll down for video . Calls for her head: Jody Arias was already looking exhausted as opening statements began in her lurid sentencing retrial where prosecutors were swift to tell jurors that only a death sentence befits her crime . Following a prosecution claim that Alexander was afraid of 'stalker' Arias, defence attorney Kirk Nurmi responded by displaying to jurors pornographic images of Arias' private parts, AZ Central reported. The photos were taken by Alexander in the hours leading up to his death - Mr Nurmi then asked the jury if they suggested Alexander was afraid of Arias as the prosecution had claimed. Mr Nurmi then spent time going through photos showing Alexander in the shower - before replaying in full a 40-minute long phone sex conversation in which the two moan as if they were having orgasms. The 34-year-old Arias was convicted of murder last year but the first jury was deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty or life in prison . The retrial opened a week ago with prosecutors telling jurors the Arizona murderer deserves the harshest sentence of them all. 'The only just punishment in this case is death,' Juan Martinez told the Maricopa County Superior Court. Mentally ill: Jodi Arias' defense attorney Kirk Nurmi argued his client is mentally ill and should not, therefore, be executed . Arias had her hair cut to shoulder-length for her return to the courtroom and appeared to have it dyed darker. She has also been wearing a new pair of nude-framed glasses - perhaps because earlier this month, a Phoenix food bank auctioned off the glasses she wore at the original trial and raised close to $1,000 for charity. Last week defense lawyer Kirk Nurmi began opening statements, telling jurors it was up to them to write the final chapter to the story. The jury had been warned that it would see graphic evidence about the killing and relationship between Arias and victim Travis Alexander - but he said she should not be executed because she is mentally ill. Prosecutor  Martinez proved his point by showing jurors a picture of Arias' victim, ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander, with his throat slit. 'This is how much she loved him,' Martinez told the jury, according to ABC. The victims' siblings were in court today along with Arias' parents and brother. Arias was convicted of murder last year but the first jury was deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty or life in prison. That required a new jury and trial to decide her punishment. A new jury that was picked over the past several weeks will listen as the former waitress tries to make another case that her life should be spared. Four hundred people were called as prospective jurors. Many of them were cut after they said they either made up their minds about the case or knew too much to be impartial. Some jurors cited their objection to the death penalty. They won't consider whether or not she's guilty - that's already been decided. The retrial is expected to last into December. Arias stabbed and slashed Alexander nearly 30 times, slit his throat so deeply she nearly decapitated him and shot him in the forehead. Judge Sherry Stephens has shut the media and public out of nearly every hearing in the case and drawn complaints from First Amendment lawyers that she has gone too far . Arias was found guilty of first degree murder in the death of former boyfriend Travis Alexander, but the jury deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty or life in prison. Now defense attorney Kirk Numi (pictured) is facing off against prosecutors in a battle where Arias' life, and fate, hang in the balance . She left his body in his shower where friends found him about five days later at his suburban Phoenix home. She acknowledged she killed Alexander, but claimed it was self-defense after he attacked her. Prosecutors said it was premeditated murder carried out in a jealous rage after the victim wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to Mexico with another woman. Weeks after Arias was convicted, the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on her punishment. Her attorneys have since sought, unsuccessfully, to dismiss the death penalty as an option. If another deadlock occurs, the death penalty would automatically be removed as an option, leaving a judge to sentence Arias to one of two options: life in prison or life in prison with the possibility of release after 25 years. Jodi Arias was found guilty of the murder of Travis Alexander in 2008 after slitting his throat so deeply she nearly decapitated him and shooting him in the forehead . Arias left the body of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander in his shower where friends found him days later at his suburban Phoenix home. Crime scene pictures from the first trial (pictured) revealed the brutal nature of the killing . Left for days: Alexander was left in this shower, for around five days before friends found his decaying body . The sentencing retrial will be a mini-trial of sorts to get a fresh jury - of 12 women and six men, including six alternates - up to speed on the case. At her last trial, she testified for 18 days, describing for jurors an abusive childhood, cheating boyfriends, dead-end jobs, a shocking sexual relationship with Alexander, and her contention that he was physically abusive. Her first trial drew a global following and inspired spectators to wait in line in the middle of the night to get a coveted seat in the courtroom. This time around, the judge has ruled that cameras can record the proceedings, but nothing can be broadcast until after the verdict. Judge Sherry Stephens has shut the media and public out of nearly every hearing in the case and drawn complaints from First Amendment lawyers that she has gone too far. Judge Stephens said the hearing closures are intended to protect Arias' right to an impartial jury. Attorney David Bodney, who represents several media outlets fighting for transparency in the case, said there have been repeated violations of the public's constitutional right to attend proceedings in the case. The costs of defending Arias have topped $2.5 million and will mount during a second penalty phase. Prosecutors have declined to provide their costs to try the case.","Arias, 34, was convicted of murder last year but the first jury was deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty or life in prison .

"A conman who defrauded Harrods out of luxury goods worth £245,000 was berated for his expensive tastes by  a judge who asked why  he didn’t just shop at Marks & Spencer. Philip Buffett used dud cheques to pay for a £216,000 Hublot watch, a second one costing £20,000 and other  luxury items. Yesterday the serial fraudster wore a red Ralph Lauren polo shirt when he appeared before Judge Simon Oliver who asked him: ‘Why the Ralph Lauren clothing? I’m assuming it’s not the real brand.’ 'Fantasist': Serial conman Phillip Buffett was told off by a judge for wearing a red Ralph Lauren polo shirt in the dock as he stood trial for cheating Harrods out of a £216,000 watch . Buffett, 49, confirmed it was genuine, to which the judge replied: ‘Well I’m glad you can afford it. What’s wrong with M&S?’ Judge Oliver said: ‘How you ever thought you could buy a watch worth £216,000 absolutely stuns me. Why anyone would want a watch worth £216,000 also stuns me.’ The judge compared Buffett to the fictional Walter Mitty, who  created a fantasy world to escape his real life. He went on: ‘You may well think it important to be perceived as important, successful and wealthy. You are neither rich nor successful. You are completely unsuccessful in all that you do.’ Buffett, of Croydon, South London, has served time for 45 previous fraud offences. But Judge Oliver spared him jail, saying prison would be a waste of taxpayers’ money because it had failed to stop him reoffending. Giving Buffett a two-year suspended sentence, the judge said: ‘We are trying to stop you reoffending. ‘I will impose a sentence that will appear to be light, but will give you the focus you need.’ Scam: Buffet used a cheque from a closed bank account to fleece the Knightsbridge store out of the £216,000 watch as well as other luxury items worth £28,000 .

"The world's fastest woman has been revealed as a British mother-of-two who smashed the land speed record by going 264mph on a motorbike her husband built. IT analyst Becci Ellis set the record on her modified Suzuki bike, smashing the existing fastest land speed by 20mph. Mrs Ellis, from Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire, bought the off-the-shelf bike second hand in 2008 to use as spares but after testing it on a track she realised it had potential to be a record-breaker. Scroll down for video . Becci Ellis, who has been named the fastest woman in the world after breaking the existing land speed record . Mrs Ellis set the record on a modified Suzuki bike, smashing the existing fastest land speed by 20mph . The 46-year-old has been riding motorbikes since she was a youngster and says it give her an adrenalin rush . Her husband Mick has spent the last two years tweaking the 1300cc bike and developing a one-of-a-kind turbo system so his wife can reach break-neck speeds. And his hard work finally paid off when Mrs Ellis blasted down the mile-long course at Elvington airfield in North Yorkshire on her beloved 500bhp Suzuki Hayabusa bike at 264.1mph, destroying American rider Jennifer Robertson's existing record of 243.6mph. The lightning-quick speed is the equivalent of travelling at a 118 metres a second and it took her just over 20 seconds to complete the course. It also makes her the fourth fastest rider in the world, just 30mph behind the overall world record set by the late American rider Bill Warner who died in a crash during the record attempt. The 46-year-old has been riding motorbikes since she was a youngster but it wasn't until she met her husband, who was a motorbike drag racer in the early 1990s that she started racing. Mrs Ellis with her husband Mike, who built the bike she used to break the land speed record in their garage . Mrs Ellis says Mick, pictured had been building the bike's boost system for a number of years to allow her to reach such fast speeds . She started attempting speed records and soon set her sights on becoming the fastest woman in the world on two wheels. She explained: 'I've had a passion for bikes since I was nine years old and I knew that was what was going to help me live my dream. 'I met Mick when I was 25 and working as a bike instructor. He had been drag racing since the 1970s and got me into it. 'I've always had a passion to be the best at something and it became obvious to me that I was going to try to be the fastest woman on two wheels. 'In 2008 I bought a second-hand Suzuki Hayabusa for spares but after testing it on the track I realised it was quick enough to set records on. The second hand Suzuki, with 25,000 miles on the clock, which Mrs Ellis was riding when she broke the record . 'Mick has been building my bike's boost system for a number of years and we're the only people in the world using it.

"A man on a flight from Singapore to Brisbane was restrained after exploding 'in a rage', damaging a seat and biting the arm of a fellow passenger. Passengers aboard Etihad Airways  470 held the man down, while the flight was forced to return to Singapore so the man could be escorted from the plane. Following the incident, the flight has since arrived safely in Brisbane. Passenger, Rob, was bitten by the man on board Etihad Airways flight 470 . The flight that was travelling to Brisbane was forced to return back to Singapore, where it had taken off . According to Tracey Mewis, a passenger who was aboard the Etihad flight, the man's behaviour before taking off from Singapore was noticeably odd, the ABC reports. 'We thought he was just off his face - he hassled two lots of couples', Ms Mewis said. She said airport workers pulled the man aside and spoke to him before boarding. Ms Mewis said for the first 40 minutes on the flight he was fine. Ms Mewis describes him ripping out the TV screen from the seat in front before assaulting people on board. 'He assaulted one of the male flight attendants and then guys on the plane just pinned him down and held him down and restrained him,' she said. Another passenger, Rob, was one of the men to restrain the man 'in a rage'. 'I had to apprehend him and in doing so just got a bit of a bite on the arm,' he said. Rob arrived in Brisbane airport on his birthday with a bandaged arm. He believes the man was drunk and may have abused substances. David Bradbury, who was on board and helped hold down the man, said while in a rage he was 'quoting religious quotes'. Mr Bradbury feared the plane was being hijacked before realising what was actually happening. An Etihad Airways spokesman confirmed that the incident  occurred and apologised for the inconvenience. The spokesman said when the plane arrived back in Singapore authorities detained the passenger, who is believed to be in his early 30s. Etihad Airways insisted they have a zero tolerance policy towards such incidents.

"Three million motorists  face being caught on camera and fined as Britain’s busiest toll road dispenses with traditional toll-booths. From the end of this month, the Dartford crossing over the M25 – used by up to 50 million vehicles a year at a rate of up to 170,000 a day - will operate a ‘free flow’ system without barriers. Instead of handing over the fee in case, motorists must pay online or by phone before they use the crossing or on an electronic system - similar to that used for the London Congestion Charge - after. Scroll down for video . Three million motorists face being caught on camera and fined as Britain’s busiest toll road - the Dartford crossing - starts asking drivers to pay the toll fee online or over the phone . Vehicles passing north through the two tolled tunnels – or south across the Queen Elizabeth Bridge – will have their number plates filmed by up to 18 ‘ANPR’ cameras which will police the system. If a car driver fails in time to pay the new £2.50 toll – up 50p the current cost of £2.00– he or she will be fined automatically up to £105. Failure to pay online or by phone by midnight of the following day will, when ‘free-flow’ goes live, result in a penalty charge of £35 if paid within 14 days, £70 up to 28 days and £105 thereafter. Up to one in 14  of vehicles using the crossing are expected not to pay, according to an impact assessment carried out last year. The AA fears many unwitting drivers will be caught out, especially if they are only occasional users. Mistakes on the ANPR number plate recognition system could also mean many drivers unfairly penalised. The tolled crossing is used by millions of families from across Britain as they head on holiday or to the Continent. But a recent AA poll showed that 85 per cent of members were unaware that they will have to pay by phone or online. The road will dispense with traditional toll booths and instead use a vehicle recognition system to check motorists have paid (file picture) Even locally, 16per cent of drivers directly affected by the new charging system are unaware of it. French company Sanef has a 10-year contract worth up to £367million to run the system for the Government, which retains ownership of the tolled crossing across the Thames which opened originally in 1991. The Highways Agency says all profits from tolling will go to the Treasury but must, by law, be spent on transport-related projects. However the AA says motorists are furious because the cost of the tolled crossing was paid off by motorists in 2003. The toll continued because the Government said a continued charge was necessary to ‘restrict demand’ for it. The Highways Agency says, of the 50million vehicles using the crossing each year, 43 million will be within the 6am to 10pm charging period. With up to 7 per cent of these likely to be fined, that means around 3 million a year face a ticket. The Highways Agency says changes in the way payments are made will come into effect on Sunday November 30 – just as the new higher charges come into effect. AA head of roads policy Paul Watters said: ‘Our worry is that this will all end in chaos. Motorists will be very annoyed. ‘They may welcome less congestion and queuing, but they won’t be happy if a penalty charge notice drops through their letterbox because they forgot to pay the one time they used it.’ He said: ‘We’ve had lots of calls from members who are very concerned. We’ve had people who want to book ahead now for the first day of operation, but say they can’t unless they sign up for the pre-pay system.’ Highways Agency project manager Nigel Gray said: ‘Dart Charge will help speed up journeys so it’s great news for the tens of thousands of drivers who use the crossing every day and for the economy.’","Dartford crossing over M25 will have a 'free flow' system without barriers .

"The Premier League may give up yet more of their traditional Saturday 3pm kick-offs to satisfy bidders in the next TV rights tender. They will want to keep both Sky and BT happy with the next three-year agreement from the 2016-17 season, with the packages on offer expected to be launched around the new year. BT Sport, who have taken the Champions League from Sky, will want at least three packages out of the current seven, and Sky cannot afford to lose any Premier League football. Jamie Carragher (centre) and Gary Neville (right) appear on Sky Sports Monday Night Football . So one option being looked at by the league and mooted in ongoing talks with broadcast partners is increasing the number of live matches to be sold. That went up from 138 to 154 in the last auction but is still less than half the 380 games in a PL season. An extra Sunday night slot — like Spain’s La Liga — could be shoehorned into the TV schedule to give BT the opportunity to screen more games, while Sky would at least retain their current share. BT chief executive Gavin Patterson has made no secret of their support for this option, saying: ‘It is a very interesting point. If there were more games available we would be very interested.’ Michael Owen (second left), Steve McManaman (centre) and David James (right) appear on BT Sport last year . There is continued upset among football agents about the FA allowing David Beckham’s former personal manager Terry Byrne to oversee the 1966 agency which represents England players’ commercial interests while also setting up management company Ten10.

The word within boxing is that Sky Sports overlord Barney Francis has been personally ringing fighters George Groves and David Haye, encouraging them to be part of the Sky pay-per-view bill at Liverpool’s Echo Arena on November 22. The main attraction that night is the rematch between Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew, a non-major title fight. It is unusual for Sky to demand extra money from subscribers for such a bout — hence the alleged involvement of Francis in beefing up the undercard. Sky made no comment.

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore donated nearly £30,000 to the Nordoff Robbins charity at the HMV Football Extravaganza tribute to Ryan Giggs. The sum was the result of a complex formula involving Giggs’s goals, appearances and medals — minus £50 for each of the United legend’s 36 bookings. Giggs paid the £1,800 himself to round the donation up to £30,000. Meanwhile, Manchester United’s senior press officer Karen Shotbolt paid £1,000 for a kiss from Stereophonics lead singer Kelly Jones.

"'Jolly': Two-year-old Kacey Hambleton, pictured, was found unresponsive when police were called to the family home in Blackpool on 10 April this year . A violent killer who shook his girlfriend's two-year-old daughter with such ferocity that her fatal injuries resembled those of a car crash victim was jailed for nine years today. Connor Gibson, 23, was said to have had a violent 'flare up' during which he grabbed and battered Kacey Hambleton in an assault which left her crying in pain. Kacey, who was described as a 'happy, jolly child' was later found unresponsive when police were called to her family home in Blackpool at around 10am on 10 April this year. When paramedics arrived, Gibson said that the little girl had slipped in the shower. His lies led to Kacey's mother Louise Hambleton, 23, being wrongly arrested as she waited at her daughter's hospital bedside. Miss Hambleton, who was at work when the incident took place, was detained in custody and only released on bail to see her daughter die in her arms, two days after the assault took place. Gibson, who has no history of violence towards children, later confessed to carrying out the killing during an 'outburst of anger' but has failed to say why. Miss Hambleton, from Blackpool, wept as a statement from her was read out condemning Gibson for his betrayal. He admitted manslaughter at Preston Crown Court  earlier this week after his not guilty plea to murder was accepted. The statement read: 'I left my daughter with someone I could trust not knowing it would be the last time I would see her alive. 'In hospital I saw bruises to Kacey's legs and couldn't understand what was going on and couldn't get anything out of Connor. I just wanted to know what happened.' She told how she was subsequently arrested and said: 'I remember thinking hurry up and ask me questions let me go. I knew I had not done anything wrong - I was being kept away from Kacey. 'Why did Connor not tell the truth.. When will I be released from this? I never will.' Miss Hambleton said that she had wrongly been branded a murderer on social networking sites and asked why Gibson had still not explained why he had done it. Kasey's father Russell Hambleton, 27, said: 'The whole family has been left absolutely devastated and heartbroken by Kacey's death. 'My little princess is gone and I feel like my heart has been ripped out. Kacey was a beautiful little girl with so much to live for; she has been taken from us far too soon.' At around 9am on the morning of the attack, Gibson, who had been put in charge of Kacey, text Miss Hambleton to tell her that her daughter was still in bed. Devastated: Kacey's father Russell Hambleton, pictured outside court today, said: 'My little princess is gone and I feel like my heart has been ripped out'. Her mother, left, said that she had yet to grieve for her daughter . Lies: Gibson's claims that Kacey had slipped led to Louise Hambleton being wrongly arrested in connection to the incident as she waited at her daughter's bedside. Above, Gibson with Kacey and Louise Hambleton . Less than an hour later, Gibson called the emergency services and said that the two-year-old had 'slipped' after he put her in the shower. According to prosecutor Francis McEntee, Gibson told the operator: 'She's breathing, she's just not responding. I heard a bang, ran in and she was on the floor. She has got like red marks on her near her private parts and stomach. So that might be it.' Paramedics arrived at 9.57am and there was a 20 second delay before he answered the door with Kacey in his arms. The medics noted that she did not feel wet as if she had been in a shower cubicle. 'Thunp': A CT scan revealed that Gibson, pictured, had left Kacey with bleeding to the surface of the brain and lacerations to the liver . She described by paramedics as 'critically ill' with pale skin, a low level of consciousness and dilated pupils and it was noted she did not feel wet as if she had been in a shower cubicle, the court heard. Gibson continued to claim that he had heard a 'thump' after leaving her in the shower and returned to find her unresponsive. After being taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Blackpool, Kacey was taken by air ambulance to the Alder Hey Children's Hospital with significant bruising to her back, buttocks legs and pelvic area as well as bruising to her face, temple and eye. A CT scan showed bleeding to the surface of the brain and lacerations to the liver. Mr  McEntee said: 'For some unknown reason the defendant flew into a rage and carried out the fatal attack. He must have spent some minutes inventing a plausible explanation. He added: 'This was an assault committed on a child by a man over 6ft and particularly heavy built. 'He was capable of causing significant damage when striking out in anger. The pain and distress would have been immediate and painful. 'It is impossible to conceive that a two-year-old could have caused such a reaction. His intent was an intent just short of that necessary for murder. In striking Kacey he would have instinctively known he would have caused her pain and harm. 'The injuries would normally be consisting with punching kicking and stamping, throwing against a hard surface. The brain injuries were as a result of a violent shake.' In mitigation David Fish QC said: 'There must have been a build up of tension and pressure at some stage lost control and assaulted Kacey. The defendant is unclear as to how or why these events unfolded.' Trusted: Miss Hambleton, pictured with Gibson, left her daughter in her boyfriend's care when she went to work on 10 April this year. Gibson, right, has never explained the reason behind the ferocious assault . Sentencing, Justice Susan Carr told Gibson: 'You subjected Kacey to very severe abuse and it implicated her mother who has suffered significantly as a result. 'She was detained in custody as her daughter was dying and she feels judged every time she goes out. The court takes this opportunity to record her dignity - neither she nor anyone else is in anyway to blame. 'This was an extreme abuse of trust. You were in sole trust of Kacey and this was a violent assault probably in anger during which you must of caused such terrible pain and such terrible fear. 'No sentence can be long enough. I think the fact you lost your temper looking after a child it's unforgivable.' Innocent: Following the incident, Miss Hambleton, pictured, was wrongly branded a murderer on social networking sites. She said that she went 'numb' when Gibson confessed to beating her daughter .","Connor Gibson, 23, battered and shook two-year-old Kacey Hambleton .

"Doug Wortham used a Defense Department giveaway program for law enforcement to stock his office with an assault rifle, a handgun and a Humvee — even though the people in his custody are in no condition to put up a fight. They're dead. Wortham is the Sharp County, Arkansas, coroner. He says the Humvee helps him navigate the rugged terrain of the Ozarks foothills, but he struggled to explain why he needs the surplus military weapons he acquired more than two years ago. 'I just wanted to protect myself,' he said. Settled for handguns: Unlike Arkansas coroner Doug Wortham, Kim Clark of the Wyoming Livestock Board settled for just a lot of .45 semi-automatic handguns for his agency when he applied to the Pentagon's 1033 surplus program . 'I just wanted to protect myself': Sharp County, Arkansas coroner Doug Wortham was given a humvee, handgun and assault rifle by the federal government (FILE) His office isn't the only government agency with limited policing powers and a questionable need for high-powered weaponry to take advantage of the program. While most of the surplus weapons go to municipal police departments and county sheriffs, an Associated Press review shows that a diverse array of other state and local agencies also have been scooping up guns and other tactical equipment no longer needed by the military. Military-grade weapons have gone to government agencies that enforce gaming laws at Kansas tribal casinos and weigh 18-wheelers in Mississippi, to the Wyoming Livestock Board and the Cumberland County Alcoholic Beverage Control Board in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Other military surplus items have been bestowed on an animal control department in Cullman County, Alabama; a harbormaster in Dartmouth, Massachusetts; and the California Assembly's Sergeant-at-Arms. The Pentagon's 1033 Program has been controversial; the White House ordered a review of it and similar programs in August after a deadly police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, led to clashes between protesters and officers decked out in combat gear. Under the 1033 Program, thousands of law-enforcement agencies have acquired hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and other military castoffs. Among them were dozens of fire departments, district attorneys, prisons, parks departments and wildlife agencies that were eligible to join the program because they have officers or investigators with arrest powers. Guns, armored vehicles and aircraft only account for a fraction of the equipment up for grabs. Several agencies surveyed by the AP said they never asked for any weapons and only enrolled in the program to get free office equipment and other common items that wouldn't be deployed on any battlefield. The agencies receiving firearms are difficult to pinpoint because the federal agency overseeing the program only releases county-level data on weapons transfers, citing security concerns. But some participating agencies — or state officials who coordinate the program — were willing to disclose their inventories. Wortham was qualified to enroll in the 1033 Program because Arkansas coroners have arrest powers. Elected to his first term as coroner in 2010, he obtained a .45-caliber pistol and an M-16 rifle in 2012 after getting a Humvee the previous year. He said he is trying to arrange for a local police department to take the two weapons. State program officials said they couldn't find Wortham's written justification for requesting the weapons. An official from the federal office that oversees the program approved both transactions. 'What does a coroner need a big gun for?' asked Marshall County, Illinois, coroner Davey Lenz, who used the program to obtain body bags. 'I have never carried a weapon in my 20 years on the job.' 'I can't stand Glocks': Like Wortham, Kim Clark armed his agency with the help of the Pentagon's 1033 Program. Clark said he participated in the program to get weapons other than the Glocks his agency issues to protect Wyoming cattle from theft . Steve Melo, the harbormaster in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, said he hasn't received any weapons but acquired a Humvee for driving in marshy areas and a night-vision scope to spot boaters in the dark. The Humvee was stripped of weapon holders and the scope isn't attached to a gun, he said. 'We have looked at it as saving this town big money,' he said. 'We're not out there in tanks. We're not dressing in battle uniform-type stuff.' The Arkansas Tobacco Control agency obtained five 12-gauge shotguns for its agents, who help regulate tobacco retailers and wholesalers. 'A lot of the convenience store owners who are involved in (tobacco) smuggling are also on the terrorist watch list, have connections to organized crime, etc.,' said Roland Darrow, an agency attorney. Darrow said his agency's law-enforcement officers have arrested at least one person whose name was on Homeland Security's terrorist watch list, but he declined to provide details, saying the information was classified. The Wyoming Livestock Board's law-enforcement unit issues Glock-made handguns to its officers, who investigate cattle thefts and other industry-related crimes. But the board also obtained seven .45-caliber handguns from the military surplus program roughly three years ago. 'I guess primarily because I can't stand Glocks,' said senior investigator Kim Clark. Similarly, Kansas State Gaming Agency enforcement director Jamie Nickoley said its 10 surplus M-16 rifles are 'just another tool' for its law-enforcement agents, who also have agency-issued handguns. The Mississippi Department of Transportation, which has an office that enforces laws governing commercial vehicles, obtained seven M-14 rifles through the program. Kayaking coroner: While so many firearms going to an agency that protects cattle may seem outrageous, Clark's requests are typical of the 1033 Program. Another surplus program through the Army gave coroner Doug Wortham's office a kayaklast year . 'We don't actually shoot them or anything. They're basically used as props during our ceremonies,' said department spokesman Kenny Foote. The 1033 Program isn't the only source of surplus property for law-enforcement agencies. They also can purchase equipment at discounted prices through the separate 1122 Program, which is overseen by the Army. State and local government agencies of all stripes can acquire other types of non-military surplus property through a program overseen by the U.S. General Services Administration. Wortham's office also obtained property through the GSA-run program but lost its privileges last year after state officials learned of concerns about some of its acquisitions, including a kayak, according to Tina Owens, deputy director of the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management. 'Why would a coroner's office need a kayak?' Owens asked. Owens' department referred the matter last year to the GSA inspector general's office, which is investigating. Neither agency would elaborate. Wortham, who is running for re-election and recently defeated a primary challenger who stars on a reality TV show about the Ozarks, denies any wrongdoing. 'This has been a political thing from the word go,' he said.","'I just wanted to protect myself': Doug Wortham from Sharp County, Arkansas made no apologies for his suspicious acquisition .

"Residents of a New York City neighborhood can count a cult among their many neighbors, according to a report. The Congregation for the Light calls Manhattan's Murray Hill area home and preaches the impending end of days and the power of karmic retribution to  men and women who believe they descend from an Aryan super race that once populated Atlantis, reports the New York Post. With all the hallmarks of a cult, it's no surprise 'the Light,' as its 200 members call it, also has some disenchanted former members spreading tales of its sinister side. Cult next door? This brownstone in Manhattan's Murray Hill neighborhood houses the Congregation of the Light, a group some ex-members say is a cult with some extremely odd beliefs . Former member Paul Arthur Miller described to the Post a young adulthood full of indentured servitude in leader Tom Baer's furniture factory, physical training for a doomsday that never seemed to come and a culture of homophobia. 'The belief is that Planet Earth will be ending soon and we would have to defend our people and safeguard our food and supplies,' 58-year-old Miller recalled to the Post. 'They changed the doomsday date at least twice,' he said. 'We were told it was imminent, weeks or months. People in the cult wouldn't have dental work done because they thought, 'Why bother?'' Symbols: The group speaks much of symbolism and, according to an ex-member, will not allow members to have any decor in their home that does not include an owl or a cross with an x . Miller said the group believed that once that doomsday did finally come, group members would ascend to a planet called Nay where they'd live blissfully and without gender or stomachs. But only those who did as they were told. Women, for instance, are not allowed to seek out higher education and must in most cases be married off in their teens in order to stay a part of the group. Miller said he was repeatedly singled out for his homosexuality, which the group's leaders called 'a hangover from the Roman Empire.' He was forced to leave his boyfriend and date women. The group, Miller said, bans all decor in a home that doesn't contain its symbols: the owl and a cross with an 'x.' 'You were always told if you leave the Light, you're subjected to evil . . . because you don't have protection,' Miller said. 'I didn’t start living until I left the Light,' he said. Among the group's other purported strange beliefs involve where they think they have their roots. 'They believe in a master Aryan race . . . that lived on Atlantis,' another former member, this one anonymous, told the Post. The Light meets in a brownstone on 35th Street once per week where Baer preaches to a few dozen men and women, who aren't allowed to take notes or read from a text. In the group's defense, Baer says he doesn't categorize it as a religion. 'We’re what a church should be,' he told the Post. 'The principles are to have a decent, sane and healthy life.' Ex-members say 'the Light' believes members descend from an Aryan super race who once populated Atlantis, shuns homosexuality as 'a hangover from the Roman Empire' and that once the doomsday comes the group will resurrect to a planet called Nay as a genderless race with no stomachs = .","The Congregation for the Light has operated its New York City headquarters on Manhattan's East Side since the 1970s .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists his side have learned from last season's crushing defeat by Chelsea and will go looking for the victory he hopes will kick-start their season. Last April Jose Mourinho, under whom Rodgers worked first time around at Stamford Bridge, came to Anfield with a tactical plan to stifle and frustrate and take advantage of any weakness. It worked perfectly as the then free-scoring home side failed to break down a disciplined defence and were caught twice on the counter-attack - the first coming, now famously, after Steven Gerrard's slip allowed Demba Ba to race through to score. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard walks off dejected to be consoled by his manager Brendan Rodgers (left) after his mistake led to their 2-0 defeat by Chelsea that ended their Premier League title hopes last season .

Jose Mourinho (left) and Chelsea ruined Liverpool's title dream last season in a spiky encounter . The defeat was the beginning of the end of Liverpool's title dream but now the tables have turned and it is Chelsea who are in top spot, unbeaten in their opening 10 matches. Mourinho will have adapted his game plan for Saturday but Rodgers insists his team are ready for the considerable challenge which awaits them, having already lost at home to Aston Villa and been held by Everton and Hull. 'We will have learned from that. This is a new challenge and it will be a tough game,' said Rodgers. 'Chelsea were obviously strong last year and they have big experience in their squad and know the league and that helps them massively. Brendan Rodgers looked relaxed in training on Thursday, despite Liverpool's poor start to the season . Rodgers will been keen to get striker Mario Balotelli firing on all cylinders as soon as possible . 'Add to that the players who have come in and Diego Costa, one of Europe's top strikers, and Cesc Fabregas, who knows the league and is a real creative force, and add (Eden) Hazard to that who is one of the best young players in the world and they are a strong outfit. 'This offers us a great chance at home to get a great result and then hopefully that can kick-start the season for us. 'I can see the improvements in us day-by-day. 'We've had injuries and in patches we have shown the level of our game is okay but it is not consistent enough and we haven't scored as many goals as last season. 'We are trying to find that solution and balance but that is something which is ongoing.' Part of Rodgers' problem is that few of his players are operating at the level they were in the second half of last season when they seemed destined to end their 24-year wait for the title.

It means he does not really know what his strongest team is, which is why all the furore over his team selection against Real Madrid in midweek needed to be viewed with some degree of perspective.

With defence being such a problem again this season the performance of Kolo Toure, who had not started anything other a Capital One Cup match since mid-February, has put £20million summer signing Dejan Lovren under threat. The 33-year-old Ivory Coast international had come to be viewed as a centre-back always likely to make a mistake but he barely put a foot wrong against the world-class talent of Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema. Manager Rodgers issues instructions to his captain during training at Melwood on Thursday . Kolo Toure turned in an impressive performance against Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday . 'Kolo was outstanding on the night and it is a great mark of his professionalism that he can come in and play as well as he did,' said Rodgers. 'One of the reasons we wanted to bring him in was because he was the right type of character. 'He knew that he may not play as many games as he has done in the past but his influence off the field and his character is contagious. 'He loves football and has a wonderful enthusiasm for the game and whether he's in the team or not, he's always the same: supporting the players. 'When called upon he can do a good job, as we saw the other night with his leadership qualities and organisation. 'Overall, I thought he and Martin Skrtel were outstanding.'","Liverpool welcome Premier League leaders Chelsea to Anfield on Saturday .

"Fierce speculation is surrounding the new season of The Simpsons when creators claim a lead character will be killed off - and religion will play a part. The killing is rumoured to take place in the first week of the 26th season, which premieres on Sunday night. But impatient fan sites across the world have been analyzing cryptic remarks by the writers for a hint of the explosive storyline as it approaches. Major storyline: Fans have been waiting for months for the 26th season which will kill off a major character . Creators announced the planned death in October last year, sparking almost a year of theories. Last week, a reporter asked executive producer Al Jean if religion plays a part in the death, to which he replied 'yes'. According to Yahoo TV, the character in question cannot be played by an actor that voices any other role in the show, since the creators said in April: 'What we told the performer is, 'This does not mean the end of your participation in The Simpsons'' - suggesting they needed reassurance of that fact. And Jean also revealed it is not an 'iconic character', saying: 'I'd like to say it's a great character, but I never used the word ""iconic"".' He added that the actor who plays the character has won an Emmy award - but that applies to all six members of the main cast: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer. Refusing to confirm or deny any of the suggested victims, he added: 'Some people have guessed it correctly, and some are really, really off.' Cryptic: The show's executive producer Al Jean has said the death will involve religion in some respect . One detail that has been revealed about the episode titled Clown in the Dumps is that Krusty the Clown decides to retire after a celebrity roast goes bad. 'I think it's an emotionally resonant episode and people will really like it,' says Jean. The Simpsons, now the longest-running prime-time TV series of all time, has become a $12 billion franchise, with merchandise lines selling everything from toys to clothes. Cast deals expire at the end of this year, but Jean says he anticipates more Simpsons seasons to come. The series averaged 5.8 million viewers for original episodes last season. 'Nobody has said anything to me about ending it or doing a finale. My guess is at least two more years or maybe four or maybe more,' Jean says. 'We're doing pretty well right now.'","Executive producer Al Jean revealed last year a lead character will die .

"A student who was just 15 when he had sex with his school's 23-year-old female security officer has said he is distraught that she did not receive prison time. Patience Perez, now 24, was last week sentenced to two years in prison with all but seven months suspended - and the judge said she could remain free if she undergoes counseling. She had sex with the teenager, who has not been named, before authorities say she tried to recruit him to kill her abusive husband. Charges relating to these claims were dropped. 'This has basically ruined me,' the boy told WTKR from his Virginia Beach, Virginia home on Tuesday. 'This has not physically hurt me, but mentally it's hurt me a lot.' Hurt: The unnamed 15-year-old boy who had sex with his school's 23-year-old security officer last year said he had been 'mentally hurt a lot' by her actions . He said Perez saw him in the hallways at . Renaissance Academy last March, approached him and gave him her . telephone number and email address. 'Like any other teenager, you would think that you're the man,' he said. 'You got this older female that's giving you her contact information.' He said they had sex and he thought it was just casual, but it turned into a month-long relationship. She would often take him to her home after school and they would drink alcohol or smoke marijuana, he said. She also confirmed the claims in court documents, WTKR reported. The boy said that Perez claimed about her husband, who was often away from home with his work as a sailor, was emotionally and physically abusive, and she joked about wanting him dead. Freed: Patience Perez, left in court and right in her mug shot, was only given a suspended sentence . United front: She left court hand-in-hand with her husband, Gilbert, after the sentencing . The affair came to a stop when the boy's mother discovered a nude photo of Perez on her son's phone and alerted authorities. He said he was shocked that she was not locked up. 'If it was a dude, if it was an older man and a younger female about my age, that dude would be locked up for rest of his life,' he said. He and his mother have now started a petition demanding Virginia judges hand out harsher sentences for such crimes. The boy's mother also lashed out at the lenient sentence saying it was like 'an arrow to the heart'. Anger: The boy and his mother, pictured, are now pushing for tougher sentences for similar crimes . 'We haven't wrapped our brain around it,' she said. 'It doesn't make sense. It's like we endured all this pain all this stress and for this to happen.' In an earlier interview, the mother had claimed Perez 'preyed on my baby'. 'She took advantage of teenage boy that had depression issues, anger issues,' she said. Perez left Norfolk County Court hand in hand with her husband, Gilbert, who stood by her after she was arrested last April. Charges that Perez conspired with the teen to have him killed were dropped at an earlier hearing. Facebook messages between the pair allegedly detailed the murder for hire plot, but police in Norfolk dropped the charges. Scene: The boy said Perez had walked up to him and given him her number in the hallway of the school . The judge told her she will have to register as a sex offender and stay away from her victim. If she completes a counseling course she will not have to go to jail. Perez still faces child sex charges in Virginia Beach and the victim's mum said she hopes that court will not be as lenient. 'I hope that that prosecutor cares more about my family than Norfolk did,' the boy's mother said. See below for video .","A judge told Patience Perez she can remain free if she has counseling .

"A house-sized asteroid has been spotted heading for Earth - and will pass just 160,000km from us today. Called asteroid 2014 UFC56, it is around 15m wide - and was only spotted for the first time yesterday. Experts say there is no risk from the flyby, which will happen at around 4:12pm EST. Called asteroid 2014 UFC56, it is around 15m wide - and was only spotted for the first time yesterday. The asteroid is the brightest object in the image. Experts say there is no risk from the flyby, which will happen at around 9:12pm UTC. The 15 meter wide space rock will miss our planet at a distance of about 160,000 km (0.4 lunar distances) at 9:12 p.m. UTC. The asteroid was discovered Saturday and despite passing so close to Earth, few if any of us will see the flyby with our eyes in a telescope. The house-sized asteroid 2014 UF56 will pass between the Earth and the Moon. The 15 meter wide space rock will miss our planet at a distance of about 160,000 km (0.4 lunar distances) at 9:12 p.m. UTC. The asteroid was discovered Saturday. Despite passing so close to Earth, few if any of us will see the flyby - even with a telescope. Experts say it was no surprise the asteroid was not spotted until now. 'With 90% of near-Earth asteroids larger than 0.6 miles (1 km) discovered, surveys are now focusing on finding 90% of objects larger than 460 feet (140-m),' amateur astronomer Bob King wroes on his blog. 'We have to take it a step at a time because the total number of near-Earth asteroids is in the millions. 'That's why objects like 2014 UF56 pop up regularly in surveys each month.' At brightest, 2014 UF56 will only reach magnitude +16, as it zips from Scutum constellation through Capricornus. The asteroid, back in 2012 visited Mars at a distance of about 8 mln km, and will again approach the Earth on Feb. 12, 2018. The Virtual Telescope Project will offer a live, online event sharing real-time images of 2014 UF56 with live commentary by their scientific staff. The stream, starting at 7:00 p.m. UTC, will be available at: virtualtelescope.eu. None of the known potentially hazardous asteroids is on a collision course with our planet, although astronomers are finding new ones all the time. These images were taken of comet C/2013 A1 Siding Spring by Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on 19 October 2014 during the comet's close flyby of Mars and the spacecraft. It is the highest-resolution image of a comet that heralds from the Oort Cloud at the edge of the solar system ever taken . It comes just says after a remarkable once-in-a-million-year event saw a comet hurtle past Mars. After Opportunity snapped an image from the surface, an image from one of the Martian orbiters has been released. And astronomers on Earth also managed to capture the extremely rare cosmic event. The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) was used to capture views of comet C/2013 A1 Siding Spring. The amazing images are the highest-resolution views ever acquired of a comet coming from the Oort Cloud at the fringes of the solar system. And the images have been used to estimate that the nucleus of the comet is roughly half the size originally thought, making it about a quarter of a mile (0.4km) wide. This image of Comet Siding Spring was taken by astronomers Nick Howes and Ron Wodaski using the Tzec Muan Observatory in Australia. The comet is the blue-ish object towards the middle of the picture, with its tail seen streaking backwards. Mars is the bright sun-like object in the middle, overexposed to reveal the comet . The HiRise camera on the MRO acquired images of this comet from a minimum distance of about 86,000 miles (138,000 kilometers), yielding a scale of about 453 feet (138 meters) per pixel. Another image taken by Nick Howes using the Tzec Muan Observatory in Australia reveals the comet and its tail as it approaches Mars. The amazing picture sees Mars look almost as bright as the sun as the image had to be overexposed in order to reveal the comet. 'We'd planned our observations for weeks in advance, scripting telescope code and setting up observation plans,' Mr Howes told MailOnline. 'We shot hundreds of images of the comet and Mars with different exposure times, and had some technical challenges to overcome, but we're delighted with the end result, which was part of a global collaboration with both professional and amateur observers. 'Tzec Muan is an educational outreach observatory, so this is great motivation also for the students' Comet C/2013 A1, also known as Siding Spring, passed within about 87,000 miles (140,000 km) of Mars, equivalent to about one-third of the distance between Earth and our moon. Nasa confirmed yesterday that all three of its Mars orbiters survived the event unscathed, while Esa and India's spacecraft were also unaffected.","15m wide space rock will pass at around 9:12pm UTC (4:12pm EST)

"An Australian man is the first to be convicted in an online sting, where charity workers went undercover as a 10 year old girl from the Philippines called 'Sweetie'. In just two months, the programme which aims to stop the webcam child sex tourism, tracked down and identified 1,000 paedophiles and in November their information was passed on to interpol and then to police all over the globe. 'Sweetie' created by a child exploitation organisation in the Netherlands, Terre Des Hommes, is a computer model who looks and moves like a real girl. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Computer generated 'Sweetie'. Charity workers posed as the 10 year old Filipino girl to catch out predators online . The online sting, which used a virtual 10 year old Filipino girl, 'Sweetie' identified 1,000 paedophiles in just two months, one Australian man has been convicted . Four operators worked in teams to take on the role of becoming 'Sweetie' in a 10 week period in June and July last year. When 'Sweetie' was online, men were tracked down using bits of information which allowed them to collect names and addresses, phone numbers, pictures and video footage. The names of 46 Australian men were thought to be among those involved. 110 of those who made contact are also believed to be British, with their names and information sent to the UK's National Crime Agency - although so far no arrests have been made. These men requested 'Sweetie' perform sex acts in front of a webcam for money. In an online campaign video against the webcam child sex tourism, the virtual image of 'Sweetie' can be seen and details what operators are forced to deal with when the virtual child logs online. The computer image says, 'every day I have to sit in front of the webcam and talk to men, just like tens of thousands of other kids. The men ask me to take off my clothes, they undress.' 'They play with themselves, they want me to play with myself. As soon as I go online they come to me. Ten, hundred, every hour, so many.'

Head of programme 'Sweetie' Hans Guyt says the children they are dealing with suffer from depression, anxiety and aggression . It said once 'Sweetie' is online they (men) swarm her, they contact kids on dating sites, social network sites and public chat rooms. Head of the programme, Hans Guyt says the children they are dealing with suffer from depression, anxiety and aggression. 'They have no idea about normal relationships, they have no idea about sexuality and what makes it worse is that it is on the increase, therefore we have sifted our attention to the demand side,' he said. 'If nothing is being done about the source of the problem this phenomenon will only increase even further.' While the organisation has only ever found six men that have ever been charged, in just two months 1,000 were implicated and now one man convicted from Australia. Scott Robert Hansen, who is a registered sex offender, pleaded guilty to three charges in Brisbane District Court. Those charges were using a carriage service to transmit indecent communications to a child under 16. Also failure to comply with a sex offenders order because of an earlier conviction of child abuse and possession of child pornography. He was sentenced to two years in prison, but is not expected to go to jail because of he has already served time in custody.

He was sentenced to an intensive corrections order for 12 months where he must not commit another offence, report to officers and receive counselling. Hansen also agreed to participate in a sexual offenders program, suggested by the judge. The BBC News obtained the chat logs of Hansen's conversations. Hansen started by asking: 'hi u really 9yo' The operator replied: 'Yes,' to which he wrote: 'wanna chat or cam with older?' He went on: 'I like asian chicks, are you... for action' His comments became more explicit: 'I'm naked, ever seen a guy naked?' He then turned on his webcam and performed a sex act in front of what he believed was a nine-year-old girl. 'We do think its a breakthrough,' said Paul Wolters from Terre Des Hommes. 'The judge actually convicted him of indecent contact with an avatar, virtual account,' he said. 'The judge said 'if you believe that it is a nine year old girl, it is law and that is good enough'.'

Every day 750,000 are online trying to achieve this sexual contact with minors, victimising minors from poorer countries like the Philippines,' he said. 'The traditional investigative operation is they (police) wait for victims to file a complaint and obviously these minors, they're never going to file a complaint.' 'It's not enough, you have to pro-actively catch the offenders.' 'We've proved that it's relatively easy to identify people and bring them to court.' Mr Wolters says the four operators who posed as 'Sweetie' have also received counselling following the operation. 'It was very distressing for them, they received very disturbing material, proposals, questions and content of conversation.' Terre Des Hommes, a charity organisation, conducted the 'Sweetie programme and had workers posing as a 10 year old Filipino girl. Most men would come from rich countries and pray on children from poor countries . 'Every day 750,000 are online trying to achieve this sexual contact with minors, victimising minors from poorer countries like the Philippines,' said Paul Wolters from Terre Des Hommes . There is a petition by charity organisation Terre Des Hommes to stop webcam child sex tourism. They are also campaigning for authorities to take a more pro-active approach to the problem which is growing worldwide . 'This one guy said the guy who got convicted (the Australian man) was not among the worse.' The programme 'Sweetie' has been halted but Terre Des Hommes is working on a continuation of the project, although have been vague on its details. The organisation hopes many more convictions will follow and it serves as a message to authorities that they need to actively try to stop what is happening on webcams all around the globe. The UK's National Crime Agency's, Director General recently made a comment that a wider debate is needed on how the UK manages offenders accessing indecent images of children online, with indications around 50,000 people in the UK are viewing indecent images. 'I personally, and my colleagues across law enforcement, find this behaviour abhorrent. All of us would like to see these people in court and we are determined to bring as many to justice as we possibly can,' said Keith Bristol.

"Sick: The weather might make us miserable, but it could also be making us ill, according to scientists . It's not unusual for the inclement British weather to make us feel a little miserable, but it could also be making us ill, say scientists. More rain and bigger storms could be the cause of more stomach bugs in certain corners of Europe, according to new research. Torrential rain leads drains to overflow, releasing germ and virus riddled water into our waterways. If this water is swallowed while engaging in watersports for example, it can make people sick. According to research, it is more likely to be viruses that cause us to be ill rather than the germs. The research was carried out as part of a project called Viroclime which aims to improve tools for tracking harmful viruses from human sewage in European waters. It has looked at viruses from five European sites including Spain, Hungary, Sweden, and Greece and one site in Brazil. There are two types of virus which could act as a signal to more serious water-based diseases - one belongs to the winter vomiting bug family, the other to noroviruses. Scientific knowledge on waterborne diseases has been a little sparse until now. Mark Sobsey, a virologist from the University of North Carolina, told Sciencedaily.com: 'If we had better data, which EU project Viroclime can gather, and we analyse the data using a health risk-based approach, we could get better estimated disease burdens from recreational water exposures. Flooding: Heavy rains and storms causes drains and rivers to overflow, spreading virus and infection riddled water which can make us ill . Research: Viroclime, a project shared by a group of universities across Europe and Brazil is looking at the link between climate change and waterborne viruses . However, he added that testing water for viruses is still difficult and costly. Scientists believe that being able to monitor viruses in water could help them predict the effects of climate change and to develop new health protection measures to suit such change. It could also help predict a rise in the number of stomach illnesses by exploiting the link to rainfall. Viroclime is a shared project between universities in the UK, Spain, Greece, Sweden, Brazil and Hungary. A case study of the projects findings will be put together after 18 months research.","Torrential rain leads to drains overflowing which spreads bacteria .

"A celebrity-loved beauty brand is helping combat the opium trade in Afghanistan by offering heroin suppliers alternative and better paid jobs. Dr. Hauschka manufacturer WALA Heilmittel founds and supports initiatives in developing parts of the world to encourage organic farming and economic self-sufficiency. With 80 percent of the world's heroin supply coming from Afghanistan, WALA believe it is essential to offer the people an alternative means of securing a livelihood. Full of roses: Organic beauty brand Dr Hauschka is helping combat the opium trade in Afghanistan by offering heroin suppliers alternative jobs as rose oil farmers . This project comes as it was revealed that opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan grew to an all-time high despite America spending more than $7bn (£4.3m) to fight it over the past decade. An Afghan government official says that Taliban and opium smugglers are fighting for the income of opium in different parts of the country, while cultivation takes place mostly in the south and southwest where insurgents are highly active and the government has little influence. In October 2004, a project for producing rose oil was established by German Agro Action and now 400 farmers are growing Damask roses on 60 hectares of land as an alternative to growing opium poppy. The idea sprung from an initiative in Burkina Faso, Africa, where WALA helped local women establish sustainable agriculture cooperatives to produce shea butter. On the farm: The projects employs 400 farmers, who are now growing Damask roses on 60 hectares of land as an alternative to growing opium poppy . Go organic: The production of rose oil is an ancient tradition in Afghanistan and the rose oil is used in products loved by A-listers . Those cooperatives now provide all the certified organic shea butter WALA needs to manufacture its Dr. Hauschka skincare products. After the success of that, they did the same with roses and chose Afghanistan because the production of rose oil is an ancient  tradition there. Dr. Hauschka, whose products are loved by Gwyneth Palrow, Madonna, Kate Upton and Jessica Alba, swears by the power of plants to renew and help maintain health. Organic beauty is big business right now. Elaine Robinson, Dr.Hauschka Head of Training and Esthetics, believes so. She said: 'Natural skincare is the essential partner to a healthy lifestyle. If you are conscious about your diet and what you put inside your body, then it goes without saying that you would only want to put the very best products, made of the highest quality natural ingredients on your skin.' Margo Marrone, Co-Founder of The Organic Pharmacy, added: ‘We are what we eat and we should all know how poisonous pesticides are so not eating them is easy to understand but our skin is also a living organ and just like the digestive system - it absorbs molecules in skincare that can be potentially harmful. 'That’s why we choose organic herbs and plant extracts in our skincare; going organic for skincare is so important because it not only is healthier but also the skin looks more healthy and beautiful.' The celebrities are catching on too. Miranda Kerr has a successful organic skincare line called Kora Oragnics full of rosehip oil and noni fruit, while Louise Redknapp's Wild About Beauty range is paraben-free and packed with German chamomile and organic rose water. Emma Reinhold from the Soil Association said: 'We believe that organic beauty products are better for people and the planet. It's as simple as that. Certified organic beauty products contain an incredible wealth of plant extracts which have amazing skin caring benefits and do not contain harsh synthetic ingredients which can be damaging to the skin. 'Organic beauty is not just about choosing products that are better for your skin, it’s about making a choice to care for the world around you. The ingredients such as rose, lavender and chamomile that are used in your pot of moisturiser or your body wash were grown without pesticides, which is better for wildlife and also protects the farmers and workers who come into contact with those ingredients. 'Buying organic also means farmers get a better deal and workers are paid a fair wage, helping them look after themselves and their families (many ingredients are grown in developing countries where poverty is a daily problem). The saying miracle in a bottle is overused in the beauty industry but organic beauty really is that -not just in terms of product performance but the way the bigger picture is part of every product you buy.'

"As he crawls around and babbles his first words, Lucas Moore is an exhilarating bundle of joy. But, remarkably, he could easily have not been here – if he had weighed just an ounce less at birth. He was born prematurely at 23 weeks weighing 520g, just 0.7 of an ounce over the hospital’s 500g cut-off point for intervention. Bundle of joy: Lucas Moore pictured with his parents Sylvia, 30, and Tom, 33, at home in Rugby, Warwickshire . Tiny: Born at 23 weeks - a week before the abortion cut-off limit - weighing a tiny 1lb 1oz, Lucas was so small and unwell that his parents claim they were advised to turn off his life-support machine . With severe health problems – including a bleed on the brain and a hole in his heart – Lucas’s chances seemed dire, and doctors warned there was a high chance of him suffering disabilities as a result. However, he defied predictions and has now celebrated his first birthday. The case will fuel the debate over guidelines governing whether hospitals try to save the lives of extremely premature babies. It will also raise fresh questions about abortion laws, which allow terminations up to 24 weeks. Proud: A year on, Lucas has no long-term health problems, his parents claim, calling him their 'miracle' baby . Lucas: The case will fuel the debate over guidelines governing whether hospitals try to save the lives of extremely premature babies . Lucas’s mother Sylvia Moore, 30, described her son as a ‘little fighter’, adding: ‘We know premature babies can make it. While the final decision of whether to help an extremely premature baby to survive is a decision primarily for doctors, in consultation with the parents, guidelines are set by the British Association of Perinatal Medicine. These state: . Less than 23 weeks: ‘It would be considered in the best interests of the baby, and standard practice, for resuscitation not to be carried out’. 23 weeks to 23 weeks and six days: ‘If… the foetal heart is heard during labour, a professional experienced in resuscitation should be available to attend the birth’. 24 weeks to 24 weeks and six days: ‘Resuscitation should be commenced unless the parents and clinicians have considered that the baby will be born severely compromised’. 25 weeks and greater: ‘It is appropriate to resuscitate babies at this gestation and, if the response is encouraging, to start intensive care’. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics has also issued guidance, which covers interventions in the case of even more premature babies. It suggests: . Between 22 weeks and 22 weeks and six days: ‘Standard practice should not be to resuscitate the baby’. It should only be considered if the parents insist and ‘the clinicians agree that it is in the baby’s best interests’. Before 22 weeks: ‘Attempts to resuscitate should only take place within a clinical research study that has been assessed and approved by a research ethics committee’. ‘If you say you will support a child that is 500g then what is the difference with one that is 495g? I think abortions are morally wrong after 22 weeks.’ Mrs Moore, from Rugby in Warwickshire, started experiencing complications with her pregnancy when her waters broke at 22 weeks. She and her husband Tom, 33, a car designer for Tata Motors, were told she would need bed rest in hospital to try and extend the pregnancy. Doctors at Coventry University Hospital warned that her baby faced being stillborn unless he had more time to develop – but she went into labour just nine days later, on August 28 last year. Lucas was unable to breathe for the first six minutes of his life as attempts were made to open his immature lungs. He was rushed to intensive care immediately – ending up spending 109 days in hospital. He had severe bleeding on both sides of the brain and [doctors] said it was worth thinking about whether we wanted to put Lucas through all this, added Mrs Moore, who is originally from Brazil. ‘I asked what they meant and they said there was a 99 per cent chance he would have cerebral palsy. He would be deaf and could be blind.’ But after ten weeks the bleeds had gone altogether, and by the time he left hospital he was overcoming the hole in his heart. Now the only signs of his ordeal are that he is small for his age and short-sighted because of a condition associated with his long-term use of an oxygen machine. Mr Moore added: ‘We said that if he started fighting we would fight for him and that’s what he did.’ A hospital spokesman said that medics had discussed the possibility of switching off Lucas’s life support simply to ‘prepare’ his parents in case he deteriorated. He added: ‘There was no sense of “giving up easily”.’","Lucas Moore from Rugby was born last summer weighing a tiny 1lb 1oz .

"Steven Naismith has revealed Samuel Eto’o’s arrival has been key to his development and helped him become Everton’s most improved player. The Scotland international has thrived since Roberto Martinez has been at Goodison Park and he produced another accomplished display against Lille on Thursday, scoring the final goal in a 3-0 win. Naismith has been on a hot streak in this campaign – that was his fifth in 12 appearances – but his all-round play has been just as striking as his goal scoring and he puts that down to being able to play and train alongside Eto’o. Former Rangers man Steven Naismith has already scored five goals in 12 appearances for Everton this season . Naismith said being able to watch Samuel Eto'o in training has been a huge boost to his development . Goal 1: Scored in 2-2 draw with Leicester . Goal 2: Scored in 2-2 draw with Arsenal . Goal 3: Scored in 6-3 defeat by Chelsea . Goal 4: Scored in 2-1 defeat by Man Utd . Goal 5: Scored in 3-0 win against Lille . Eto’o has made a big impression on Everton’s squad, most notably with how he approaches training every day, and Naismith says he and Romelu Lukaku are certainly feeling the benefits. Naismith said: ‘The two of them work closely in training and so every day he is seeing him, the way he moves, and seeing where he takes his touches and it is definitely going to help him. It is not as if they go and do specific things together, it is just general, off – the – cuff stuff that Samuel does that Rom will be catching onto and hopefully taking into his game. ‘But without a doubt it does help watching someone like Samuel. It’s not like you are sitting down chatting to him and analysing the whole way he has played throughout his career. ‘It’s just watching what they do on a day-to-day basis. There might be some sessions when Samuel is scoring a lot of goals, so you are picking up on how he is getting into the positions to score those goals. Naismith was signed by David Moyes but has really flourished since Roberto Martinez took charge at Goodison . Naismith said that £28million summer signing Romelu Lukaku also feels the benefit of training with Eto'o . ‘Watching him is definitely helping me and with Big Duncan (Ferguson) helping with the squad as well giving you pointers we have great people around us that are going to make us better players.’ Naismith took time to find his feet after he arrived as a free agent in June 2012 but he has not looked back since Martinez arrived. He has 19 months left on his current contract and it is highly likely he will stay beyond that. Martinez said: 'I love watching Steven play. I think the way he is adapting in different positions, even during games, he has an incredible intelligence. The football intelligence that he has is quite refreshing and important in our squad. ‘But it is important we keep focusing on the games and as I say behind the scenes we always keep an eye on every individual situation.’","Steven Naismith has scored five goals in 12 appearances this season .

"A mysterious hero in an LA Dodgers cap who carried an elderly man from the flames of his burning house has been unmasked as a local truck driver. Thomas Artiaga carried 73-year-old Robert Wells from his flaming home in Fresno, California on Saturday. Video of the dramatic rescue showed bystanders panicking outside the house, as flames stream from the building. Scroll down for video . Elderly: The hero emerged from the duplex with an elderly man over his shoulder as the duplex continued to burn . Rescued: The mystery man is then seen placing the elderly man -- who had been hooked up to an oxygen tank due to respiratory issues -- in an upright position as witnesses rush to make sure the man is okay . As Mr Wells's family shouted desperately for help, Artiaga was pictured emerged from the apartment building with Mr Wells slung over his shoulder - but left the scene soon after to avoid attention. But his heroism caught up with him when he was honored last night on the Jimmy Kimmel show, and given the chance to make the first pitch for his beloved Dodgers at a game this weekend. Sat in the audience with his wife Hannah, the father-of-three was surprised to be hauled onstage and presented with an LA Dodgers Jersey and a signed baseball by former manager Tommy Lasorda. Rewarded: Artiaga met legendary LA Dodgers managed Tommy Lasorda on the Jimmy Kimmel show, and will throw the first pitch at a Dodgers game this weekend . Family: Thomas Artiaga is pictured above with his wife Hannah, right, and one of his sons, left . The Dodgers legend praised Artiaga's 'selfless heroism' as he shook his hand and offered him the chance to open the game this weekend. Speaking to local news earlier in the week, Artiaga described his actions as 'instinct'. He revealed that he was passing by in his truck when he saw the blaze, leaped out and plucked the stricken Mr Wells from his backyard and carried him to safety. He told ABC News: 'It's just an instinct - you see something and you help out people.' On Kimmel's show last night, Artiaga elaborated, telling how he could feel the heat from the blaze as he carried Wells away. He laughed off suggestions that he was a serial do-gooder who wears a cape at weekends. Unassuming: Artiaga batted away labels of heroism, referring to his actions as 'instinct' Reunion: Days after the destructive blaze, Artiaga met with Wells again, who thanked him . Describing Mr Wells's reaction to the rescue, Artiaga simply said: 'Yeah's he's happy about it.' The two met in calmer circumstances earlier this week when Artiaga made a visit to the hotel where Wells is staying with his family after their home was destroyed. He said: 'I'm glad you was there. I don't know where you were coming from or what, but I'm glad.' Firefighters say the Saturday morning blaze started in the garage of the Fresno apartment, where Wells lived with his daughter, granddaughter and great-grandson. Aftermath: The apartment was destroyed by the powerful fire on Saturday . Flames quickly spread. Wells is frail and relies on oxygen tank to breathe. Wells' daughter, Roberta Francis, 51, escaped to the street, where she shouted for anyone to help her father still inside. Meza, 40, was working on a nearby apartment and heard her cries. Artiaga was in the neighborhood helping an elderly friend with yard work when he saw the commotion. Firefighters arrived soon after the rescue and put out the flames that caused an estimated $100,000 in damage. Wells was taken to a local hospital for treatment and later released. Frail: Wells, pictured above with his daughter Robert Francis, needs an oxygen tank to breathe, and struggles to walk. He was trapped in his back yard by the flames .","Unnamed hero plucked Robert Wells, 73, from burning home Saturday .

"No one would much like the idea of eating 6lb of tomatoes a day. But if their goodness was popped in an easy-to-swallow pill that you were told might prevent strokes and heart attacks you would probably be putting in an order tomorrow. Researchers believe they may have come up with just that after trials on the supplement Ateronon. Health secret: The Ateronon pill contains the lycopene chemical found in tomato skin . The daily pill contains a chemical . called lycopene which makes tomatoes red and is known to break down . fatty deposits in the arteries. A Cambridge University study found . taking the capsule boosted blood flow and improved the lining of vessels . in patients with pre-existing heart conditions. It also increased the . flexibility of their arteries by 50 per cent. The scientists believe it could limit . the damage caused by heart disease – responsible for 180,000 deaths a . year – and help cut the 49,000 deaths a year from strokes. Breakthrough: Scientists believe the new pill will save millions of lives around the world. Dr Ian Wilkinson, right, is the director of Cambridge University's clinical trials unit . Natural remedy: The pill incorporates a newly developed version of modified lycopene compound . They also . hope it could benefit those with arthritis, diabetes and even slow the . progress of cancer. Each pill provides the equivalent of eating around . 6lb of ripe tomatoes. Studies have shown eating a Mediterranean-style . diet rich in tomatoes, fish, vegetables, nuts and olive oil can . significantly reduce cholesterol and help prevent cardiovascular . disease. Preliminary results from a two-month . trial, in which the pill was given to 36 heart disease patients and 36 . healthy volunteers with an average age of 67, were presented at a . meeting of the American Heart Association. It was shown to improve the function . of the endothelium – the layer of cells lining blood vessels. It also . boosted their sensitivity to nitric oxide, the gas which triggers the . dilation of the arteries in response to exercise. Ian Wilkinson, of Cambridge . University’s clinical trials unit, said: ‘These results are potentially . very significant, but we need more trials to see if they translate into . fewer heart attacks and strokes.’ Peter Kirkpatrick, a leading . neurosurgeon and medical adviser to CamNutra, which has developed . Ateronon, said: ‘It is too early to come to firm conclusions, but the . results from this trial are far better than anything we could have hoped . for.’ Further studies are planned, with . researchers hoping it could offer an alternative to statins for heart . disease sufferers who cannot take the cholesterol-lowering drugs. Mike Knapton, of the British Heart . Foundation, said: ‘Although this showed lycopene improved blood flow in . people with heart disease, that’s a long way from demonstrating that . taking it could improve outcomes for people with heart disease. The best . way to get the benefits of a Mediterranean diet is to eat plenty of . fresh fruit and vegetables.’ Trial: Ateronon was shown to dramatically improve the function of the cells lining blood vessels .

"They once bustled to the soundtrack of thousands of soldiers working towards establishing security in a war zone. But U.S. military bases in Iraq are fast becoming ghost towns as America continues to withdraw virtually all of its troops by December 31. Only 6,000 troops remain in the country - down from a peak of 170,000 at the height of the war in 2007. And of the 505 military bases set up during the eight-year mission, only four continue to have a handful of personnel. Ghost town: Camp Cooke, 20 miles north of Baghdad in Taji, has become deserted in recent days following the mass exodus of American troops . Empty: Buildings lie empty and vacant housing units are marked with ribbons as the drawdown continues, illustrated here at Camp Cooke . Kalsu, in Iskandariya; Echo in Diwaniya; Camp Adder near Nasiriya; and Camp Bravo in Basra are all shadows of their former selves. Adder, once the largest base in southern Iraq, will be the last to close when control is formally passed on to Iraq’s Receivership Secretariat. But it is expected to spring back into life when the Iraqi military begins operating a major air base there. The U.S. is donating its seven-story control tower to the cause, along with equipment too worn down or too expensive to ship out. In Basra, Camp Bravo is now also barely inhabited. The hard-shelled tents constructed by the British and later used by Americans are empty, rows of commercial generators remain silent and the only tracks in the mud belong to animals. And Camp Cooke, 20 miles north of Baghdad in Taji, has only a few dwellers left. Ribbons mark vacant housing units, and tanks lie discarded on dusty fields. The ending of the cyclical deployment of almost one million troops will today see U.S. President Barack Obama meeting Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri-al Maliki at the White House. The pair, who have pledged to maintain strong ties after the troop withdrawal, will discuss the next phase of the relationship between their countries. Hand me downs: Equipment which is worn down or too expensive to ship back to the U.S. will be given to the Iraqis . Derelict: Soldiers left messages on discarded tanks at Camp Cooke, which will remain in Iraq . But the contours of the partnership between Washington and Baghdad remain murky, especially with Iran eager to assert influence over its neighbouring country. Serious questions also remain about Iraq's capacity to stabilise both its politics and security. The end of the war marks a promise kept for Obama, which is one the White House is eager to promote. The meeting is expected to focus heavily on how the U.S. and Iraq will continue to cooperate on security issues without the presence of American troops. Iraqi leaders have said they want U.S. military training help for their security forces but have been unable to agree on what type of help they would like, or what protections they would be willing to give American trainers. The White House said Obama and al-Maliki would also discuss cooperation on energy, trade and education. They will hold a joint news conference at the White House, before laying wreaths at Arlington National Cemetery, where some of the nearly 4,500 Americans killed in the Iraq war are buried. Empty: Camp Cooke consists of 1,000 buildings, with only a handful of them now inhabited by a very small group of soldiers . Shadow: Camp Cooke used to hum to the sounds of humvees, now only a few cars take to its dusty streets each day . Looming over the talks are concerns among U.S. officials over how Iraq's relationship with Iran will develop with a significantly smaller U.S. presence in the region. Al-Maliki has insisted that Iraq will chart its future according to its own national interests, not the dictates of Iran or any other country. But some U.S. officials have suggested that Iranian influence in Iraq would inevitably grow once American troops depart. Both countries have Shiite majorities and are dominated by Shiite political groups. Many Iraqi politicians spent time in exile in Iran under Saddam Hussein's repressive regime, and one of al-Maliki's main allies - anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr - is believed to spend most of his time in Iran. Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said how Baghdad chooses to orient itself will significantly influence the future of Iraq's relationship with the U.S. Drawdown: U.S. navy crew fold their national flag as they prepare to hand over their base to Iraqi forces in Basra on December 1 . Loading up: Troops getting ready to move out of Camp Adder, near Nasiriyia, earlier this month . He said: 'A lot of this really comes down to, what kind of role is Iraq going to play in regional security? 'Is it going to be a place where bad people come and go, or is it going to play a role in calming down a region that needs some calming down?' The first hints as to how Iraq will assert itself in the region may come from how it handles the troubles in Syria, where a bloody government crackdown on protesters has killed more than 4,000 people, according to the United Nations. The Obama administration has called for Syrian President Bashar Assad to step down. But Iraq has been much more circumspect, with al-Maliki warning of civil war if Assad falls and abstaining from Arab League votes suspending Syria's membership an imposing sanctions. Those positions align Iraq more closely with Iran, a key Syrian ally. The U.S. has warned Iraq's neighbors that even though American troops are leaving, the U.S. will maintain a significant presence there. Even though the war is ending, the U.S. will maintain a large presence in Iraq. About 16,000 people are working at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, making it America's largest mission around the world.

"Qantas has unveiled its new business suites featuring seats that allow customers to fully recline and sleep during take-off and landing. The new seats will be available on A330 aircraft that fly domestically and to Asia and Hawaii. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, celebrity chef Neil Perry and Qantas ambassador Lindy Klim announced the changes at an event in Sydney on Tuesday, showcasing a mock-up of the new business class configuration. Scroll down for video . Qantas CEO Alan Joyce unveiled new business suites featuring seats that will allow customers to fully recline and sleep during take-off and landing . Qantas CEO Alan Joyce (far right), celebrity chef Neil Perry (second from right) and Qantas ambassador Lindy Klim (front) announced the changes at an event in Sydney on Tuesday . Mr Joyce said the upgrade would improve more than 15 international and domestic routes. 'There's enough space to eat while continuing to work, which is something our business customers said was very important to them, and plenty of storage room to keep the range of electronic devices that people now travel with,' he said. 'A key point of difference from all other carriers is that the seat can be in recline and fitted with the mattress from take-off right through to landing. 'With many Business passengers enjoying a meal in the lounge prior to travelling, this means more time to rest and sleep.' But the airline will have to wait for approval from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority before passengers will be able to lie down during take-off. Mr Joyce said the upgrade would improve more than 15 international and domestic routes . The suites, which have fully-flat beds and direct aisle access, were designed in collaboration with designer Marc Newson . CASA spokesman Peter Gibson said current rules require seats to be upright during take-off and landing. 'They've got to get an engineering approval for these seats which are a different type of seat,' Mr Gibson told Daily Mail Australia. 'They need special approval to be partially reclined. 'These seats are already approved and used in Europe, it's a matter of us reviewing the engineering data which is expected to be in time for them to launch this in December.' The suites, which have fully-flat beds and direct aisle access, were designed in collaboration with designer Marc Newson. Economy seats on international A330s are also getting an upgrade, with cabins set to be fitted with an updated model of the 'Recaro' seat, an earlier version of which is already installed on Qantas A380 and B747 aircraft. Economy seats on the A330-200s for Qantas Domestic will also be refreshed.

"There's a common perception among Australians that the seafood served up to consumers is local produce. But the reality is that Australia imports more than 70 per cent of its seafood. In a shocking revelation, former chef and food critic Matthew Evans has revealed that the flathead, barramundi, Pacific dory and prawns sold to Australians are sourced from South America or Asia. This is all to meet the growing appetite for seafood and the demand for cheaper produce. Not only is this taking a toll on the Australian seafood industry but it is also putting the consumers' health at risk, according to Mr Evans. He says lax labelling of seafood allows businesses to sell their produce while consumers are completely unaware that they are condoning poor practices in some fisheries, placing particular species under threat, destroying habitats and accepting working conditions that violate human rights. Scroll down for video . Former chef and food critic Matthew Evans unveils the truth behind the seafood Australians eat and has also initiated a senate inquiry into seafood labelling . In a three part documentary series, Mr Evans goes to Thailand (pictured) to investigate how they farm the prawns which are then sold in Australia . Mr Evans says up until now, consumers have been kept in the dark about what seafood they are buying and eating. 'When we eat near the coast or in Australia, we tend to presume that it comes from nearby when the reality is that it often isn't,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'But roughly 72 per cent of seafood that we eat is imported. 'We're a net importer of seafood and have been for a long time and that will probably increase. We are eating more seafood than we did say 20 to 30 years ago. 'I don't have a problem with imported seafood if it's produced sustainably.' This is the motivation behind his campaign to push for clearer seafood labelling, as Mr Evans uncovers the truth behind some of Australia's favourite dishes in SBS three-part documentary 'What's the Catch?'. However the most distressing discovery for Mr Evans was that most of the fish or flake at local fish and chips shops are from South America. 'A lot of what we eat is flake and that means we could be eating any one of 400 species of shark,' he said. 'But then I met a guy who represents the fisherman from southeast of Australia. They catch heaps of flat head in his local area but 9 out of 10 fish and chips shops don't sell the true flat head and sell the South American import. 'So you'll be in a town next to fishing boats eating fish and chips that has come from South America rather than the flat head that comes from the boats you can see at the end of the jetty.' Lax regulations on seafood labelling in Australia allows businesses to sell their produce without telling consumers what's really underneath the batter . Oceans campaigner of Greenpeace Australia, Nathaniel Pelle, supports this claim. 'The Australian fish we all know and think we're eating is in fact a completely unrelated species called stick fish,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's a fish from South America that's from a different family but is sold to us as flat head.' Mr Pelle adds this is a similar case for basa, a native to Vietnam's Mekong Delta, which is often deceptively labelled as 'pacific dory'. 'Basa is a cat fish and isn't part of the dory family,' he said. 'But it's commonly marketed as Pacific dory because businesses aren't obliged to abide by the fish name standards.' A Greenpeace report shows this has a greater health issue as for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers who are recommended to limit their intake of catfish, sharks and orange roughy due to its high content of mercury. 'Without correct labelling we won't know what we're eating,' Mr Pelle said. Further research in the report reveals 68 per cent of barramundi sold in Australia is imported from Asian countries such as Taiwan and Indonesia. A fisherman casts his net from a boat in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam . Fisherman catch catfish in Vietnam which is then exported and sold in Australia . As for the prawns sold in Australian eateries, such as our sushi or pizzas, it is most likely they are from Thailand. 'Sadly the poorly managed countries through South-East Asia don't have the resources to police and manage their fisheries properly,' Mr Evans said. 'Our fisheries and fish farms are at a disadvantage because they have to meet much more stringent regulations. 'Antibiotics in prawn farms are used overseas but can't be used in Australian prawn farms because they are considered dangerous within the Australian market. But then we can buy prawns from a system which allows that. 'Part of the problem from my perspective is that massive amounts of seafood has been ripped out of our system, just so we can have cheap prawns in our pizzas and sushi.' Even local fish and chips stores are sourcing cheaper imported produce trying to keep up with the demands. 'A local told me that they have to pay $3 more to put Australian flat head rather than South American flat head on their menu for a serve of fish and chips,' Mr Evans said. 'And I know that South American fisheries are not well regulated.' Mr Evans says Australia imports more than 70% of its seafood and this will only continue to increase . Mr Evans says South-East Asian countries don't have the resources to police and manage their fisheries properly . Mr Evans is backed by Greenpeace and the Australian Marine Conservation Society, who also launched the Label My Fish campaign on Thursday. They are calling for Australia to follow the European Union's example of proper seafood labelling. This means Australians will know what species they're eating, where it was caught and how it was produced. Mr Evans believes this will help consumers make a sustainable choice before they buy their seafood. His prime concern is that Australians aren't aware of where their produce is coming from, which prompted him to initiate a senate inquiry into seafood labelling. Mr Evans says lack of seafood labelling on sushi prevents Australians from making sustainable choices about seafood . 'The only way we can make a conscious decision to choose sustainable seafood, is by knowing for a start, what we're eating,' Mr Evans said. 'I want people to know what they're eating so that they think about their seafood and they don't see the ocean as this bottomless pit that will provide seafood forever. 'Our choices can make a difference and all we need to do is ask what's on our plate. 'Some people won't care. They will always buy the lowest price. But until we have that information, we have no power to make that choice.' And if we don't act now, Mr Evans says this will continue to damage our marine environment. 'It will impact us like the fisheries all over that world that are at capacity or over-fished,' he said. 'The oceans need our help. They've reached their limit.' 'So until we know what we're eating, we can't make that conscious decision because we don't know what actually is on our plate with the way the system currently stands.'

"An 'obsessively jealous' former police officer who brutally stabbed his pregnant girlfriend to death has been jailed for a minimum of 28 years. Jonathan Sutton, 40, wrongly believed Emma Siswick was cheating on him when he stabbed her 81 times in 'anger and possessive rage' at the home they shared in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. Sutton also stabbed two boys, aged nine and 11, in an attack that was described as 'little short of torture'. Brutal: Jonathan Sutton, 40, left, wrongly believed Emma Siswick, right, was cheating on him when he stabbed her 81 times in 'anger and possessive rage' at the home they shared in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire . 'Horrific': Three of the rooms in the home that Ms Siswick and Jonathan Sutton shared in Huddersfield, pictured above,  were covered in blood following the attack in May this year . The defendant pleaded guilty to Ms Siswick's murder and the grievous bodily harm of the two boys at Leeds Crown Court today. The court heard that Sutton initially attacked his partner with a glass after discovering a text message on her phone and deciding that she was being unfaithful to him. He then stabbed her with a knife in the basement kitchen before attacking the two boys in other parts of the house. Miss Siswick called for help and the older boy heard her cries, the court heard. It was then Sutton turned his attention to him. The elder of the two boys was able to attract the attention of neighbours - who called the police - when he ran from the house screaming and bleeding profusely. Three rooms of the house on Reinwood Road, Huddersfield, where the attack took place, were left covered in blood. 'Possessive': Blood is seen on one of the windows of the house where Ms Siswick was murdered, left. And right, Ms Siswick, who had worked in a school for disabled children before she was killed . Violent: Sutton initially attacked his partner with a glass after discovering a text message on her phone. He then went on to stab Ms Siswick, who was pregnant at the time. Above, the home they shared in Huddersfield . In the hours before the attack he had consumed seven or eight beers, some wine amphetamine and M-Cat. Mr Justice Edis told Sutton: 'You have committed three offences which are as serious as it's possible to imagine.' The judge continued: 'Looking at the photographs of the house where all this happened ... is a truly horrific experience. 'Jealous': Sentencing Sutton, pictured, Mr Justic Edis said that he was 'an obsessively jealous man' who had lost his temper . 'There are three different sites in that property where very serious assaults with knives were carried out. There's blood everywhere. 'You inflicted 81 separate cut injuries to Emma. She fought you to try to save herself.' Mr Justice Edis said Ms Siswick, 37, was pregnant at the time of her murder but the couple, who had been together just over three years, had discussed terminating the pregnancy. He said there had been no previous assaults in the relationship, despite frequent arguments. The murder happened after Sutton discovered a 'harmless' text message and decided Ms Siswick, who had worked in a school for disabled children for a decade, was being unfaithful to him, which she was not. 'Your motive was anger and possessive rage,' Mr Justice Edis said. 'In all of your relationships, you have been obsessively jealous of the women you lived with, checking them and their conduct in ways which were demeaning and humiliating and no doubt, to them, deeply unsettling. 'Because of your weakness in that regard, it appears that you simply lost your temper and in anger, without pre-mediation, killed her.' He added: 'You were an obsessively jealous man who lost his temper.' Mr Justice Edis described the attacks on the children as 'truly horrific' and told Sutton he had caused them 'irreparable harm'. He said: 'Exactly what you intended to do to them may never really be known. What you certainly did was to inflict painful, if not life-threatening, injuries. If that's what you intended to do it was little short of torture.' He added: 'You have left them with physical scars which they will see every day of their lives to remind them of what happened that day. 'We can only speculate about the mental scars which you have left with them as well.' Crime scene: The elder of the two boys was able to attract the attention of neighbours - who called the police - when he ran from the house screaming and bleeding profusely. Above, police officers at the scene in May . Sutton received concurrent life sentences for each of the three counts he admitted. He was told he would serve a minimum of eight years for the two charges of wounding with intent and a minimum of 28 years for Ms Siswick's murder. West Yorkshire Police welcomed the outcome of today's hearing. Detective Chief Inspector Adrian Taylor, senior investigating officer, said: 'At 9.30pm on the night of May 18 this year we were called to a property in Huddersfield to reports of an ongoing domestic incident. Torture: The court heard that Sutton inflicted painful injuries on the two boys. Above left, an officer outside the house in Hudfdersfield and, right, officers enter the property . 'What we found there was much worse - a 37-year-old woman had been killed and two children had suffered serious stab wounds. 'Following a short investigation, Jonathan Sutton was arrested and charged with the murder of Emma Siswick and the grievous bodily harm of the two children. 'We may never know the reasons why he carried out this brutal attack, but we welcome this guilty plea for Emma and the two young children he seriously assaulted. 'We hope that her family can now start to rebuild their lives and move on from this horrific incident.' A spokesperson for Ms Siswick's family thanked 'all her family and friends for their unwavering support throughout this devastating time'.","Jonathan Sutton, 40, stabbed his pregnant girlfriend to death in May .

"California has passed a law which will ban single-use plastic bags throughout the state, and bring in a 10cents charge to use disposal paper bags instead. The legislation, which will come into effect in 2016, is the nation's first statewide ban on the bags, which will affect grocery stores, convenience stores as pharmacies. New rules, signed into law today by Governor Jerry Brown will let grocers charge a minimum of 10cents to use paper bags instead. Banned: By 2016, single-use plastic bags will be banned throughout California. Above, a man carries two bags past the state Capitol in Sacramento . The bill, SB270, is a response to rising levels of litter - particularly in the Pacific ocean. But it has outraged plastic bag manufacturers, who claim the bill will destroy jobs and drive up prices for the poor. A national coalition of plastic bag manufacturers immediately said it would seek a voter referendum to repeal the law, which is scheduled to take effect in July 2015. State Senator Alex Padilla (D-Los Angeles), who proposed the law, said that the will was already there because so many cities and counties - including LA and San Francisco - already have their own bans. The measure marks a major milestone for environmental activists who have successfully pushed plastic bag bans in cities across the U.S., including Chicago, Austin and Seattle. In a signing statement, Governor Brown said: 'This bill is a step in the right direction - it reduces the torrent of plastic polluting our beaches, parks and even the vast ocean itself. We're the first to ban these bags, and we won't be the last.' Ocean trash: Governor Jerry Brown said the bill will help clean up the oceans in California . Under threat: It is hoped reusable bags will become more widespread thanks to the bill - but manufacturers oppose it . Plastic bag manufacturers have aggressively pushed back through their trade group, the American Progressive Bag Alliance. The group aired commercials in California blasting the ban as a cash-giveaway to grocers that would lead to a loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs. Lee Califf, the alliance's director, said: 'If this law were allowed to go into effect, it would jeopardize thousands of California manufacturing jobs, hurt the environment, and fleece consumers for billions so grocery store shareholders and their union partners can line their pockets.' Paper bag manufacturers also opposed the bill. The American Forest and Paper Association, a trade group, says it unfairly treats their commonly recycled products like plastic, while holding reusable plastic bags to a lower standard for recyclable content. Responding to the concerns about job losses, the bill includes $2million in loans for plastic bag manufacturers to shift their operations to make reusable bags. That provision won the support of Los Angeles Democratic Senators Kevin De Leon and Ricardo Lara, who blocked earlier versions of the legislation. Lawmakers of both parties who opposed SB270 said it would penalize lower-income residents by charging them for bags they once received for free. The bill was amended to waive fees for customers who are on public assistance and limit how grocers can spend the proceeds from the fees. Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico also have pending legislation to ban single-use bags.","Bill, signed into law by California's Governor today, is first of its kind .

"A grandmother who was prematurely declared dead later awoke in a hospital's freezer and desperately struggled to get out before eventually freezing to death, according to court documents. The family of Maria de Jesus Arroyo, 80, can go forward with a lawsuit against the California hospital that prematurely declared her dead in July 2010, an appeals court ruled on Wednesday. The California 2nd District Court of . Appeal overturned a lower court ruling that the lawsuit against Boyle Heights' White . Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles was filed too late. The appeals court ruled that the family had no way of knowing Arroyo, a married mother-of-eight, had later awoken and died in the freezer before a pathologist revealed his findings in 2011.

Missed: Maria de Jesus Arroyo, pictured with her husband of 63 years, was prematurely declared dead after a heart attack in 2010 and frozen alive in the hospital freezer, according to court documents . Mrs Arroyo, who had just celebrated her 80th birthday with relatives, suffered a heart attack on July 26, 2010 and was declared dead by staff at White Memorial, where she was placed in a freezer. Morticians who received her body a few days later discovered that it was face down and that she had a broken nose and disfiguring cuts and bruises to her face, court papers said. The injuries to her face were so bad that they could not be covered with makeup, the Los Angeles Times reported. Arroyo's family filed a lawsuit that claimed her body was mishandled soon after.

The grandmother was left with a broken nose and bruises after she tried to get out of the freezer . Family: She is pictured, center, with just a third of her grandchildren, according to her memorial website . At a hearing in December 2011, a pathologist said she had been 'frozen alive', 'eventually woke up' and caused the injuries herself as she tried to escape the 'frozen tomb,' court records said. The family withdrew the lawsuit and in May 2012 filed a medical-malpractice lawsuit, claiming the hospital mistakenly declared her dead and froze her while she was still alive. A judge in Los Angeles County Superior Court threw out the lawsuit, ruling that it was filed past the one-year statute of limitations after her injuries were discovered. But the appellate court said the family had 'absolutely no reason' to suspect that the woman was alive until the pathologist gave his expert opinion. The case will now return to the lower court. Lawsuit: White Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles now faces a medical malpractice lawsuit from the family . The hospital has not addressed the allegation that Arroyo was prematurely declared dead, the Times said, citing court records. A hospital representative has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment.

'It is still early in the investigation and unknown if criminal charges will be filed.' Tinidad asked anyone in the neighbourhood who may have known the woman to come forward. 'Anyone who knows of someone who has been pregnant and is no longer pregnant, but has no baby – that’s something we’d like them to contact the detectives about,' Trindad said. Jimmy Alvarez who lives near the complex where the baby was found heard Jorge Miranda crying for help after Miranda made the horrific discovery. Alvarez told reporters that the discovery made Miranda feel, 'very bad.' He described Miranda as being in shock. 'He was shocked, he was scared,' Alvarez said of Miranda.

"Bill Gates has bought an $18 million horse farm in San Diego from weight-loss guru Jenny Craig. The 200-acre ranch features a guest house, office, four barns, a mile-long racetrack, and sprawling fields. It is likely to be a second home for the Microsoft billionaire, and a second racing track for his 18-year-old daughter Jennifer, an avid horse rider. But it comes amid outrage over Gates's first equestrian estate in Florida where he allegedly pays $250 a day in fines for illegally dumping manure. Scroll down for video . Sprawling: The billionaire Gates family will enjoy 200 acres of fields and racing tracks on Jenny Craig's San Diego ranch after buying it for $18 million . Bespoke: Guests will be treated to panoramic views of the racing track with floor-to-ceiling windows in the study, which comes complete with trophy cupboards . Town inspectors in Wellington, Florida, claim the livestock manure dump on Gates' $8.7 million sprawling property is only 18.75 feet from a narrow pond, while Wellington's code mandates that it be at least 100 feet away. According to Page Six, the businessman - who is worth around $80 billion - has racked up $40,000 in daily fines so far. A second code violation apparently relates to Gates not having a proper permit for the storage bin in the first place. However, he appears unfazed by the furor as he sealed a multi-million deal for a second ranch just days after the allegations emerged. Paseana Ranch - named after the first champion horse owned by Craig and her late husband - is lined with palm trees, with floor-to-ceiling windows looking out onto the landscape. It is being sold by real estate agents Catherine and Jason Barry of Barry Estates who deal in opulent properties for the extremely rich and famous. Inside, the Gates family will enjoy bespoke wooden surfacing, wooden eaves on sloped ceilings, and numerous trophy cabinets. In the vast outdoors, Gates plans to build a grand prix track for hunters and jumpers. Craig first put the property up for sale in 2010 for $30 million, but was forced to revise the price to $25 million before taking it off the market in fall 2012. Delighted: Jenny Craig would not reveal Gates (right) bought her ranch but said she was delighted a family with enough wealth to transform it . Extensive: There is space for 34 horses in the stables at Paseana Ranch, named after Craig's first champion mule. But the Gates already have another ranch . Plans: Bill Gates plans to build a grand prix track for hunters and jumpers to visit the center which is lined with palm trees and has a mile-long racing track . Horse-riding fans: Craig, like the Gates family, is an avid horse rider - made plain by the numerous framed photos and paintings and statues of racing horses . Old fashioned: The living room, decorated with horse-themed curtains and pillows, has a heavy oak table, wooden eaves, and polished flooring . Rise and shine: With small wood-paneled windows letting the San Diego sun shine in every morning, the Gates family will enjoy a sunlit breakfast at this kitchen bar . Luscious: Craig said she is delighted her ranch has been bought by a family with the wealth to maintain the impeccable grounds and elevate it even more . Community: Craig has used the racing track as a facility for horse riders across San Diego and hopes the Gates family will do the same . Towering: The property's buildings are shrouded by trees on the California hills with rambling mountains in the background . Finally, the Gates snapped up the ranch for $18 million - despite it not being listed with any real estates agents. 'I was happy that the buyer is someone who can afford to turn it into the showplace it was meant to be,' Craig said, refusing to name the buyer. 'It will be kept as a horse barn so the neighbors will be thrilled... the person who bought it will make it like it can and should be.' A spokesman for the Gates family told the San Diego Tribune: 'The family has enjoyed visiting the San Diego area with friends and family for many years and has purchased the Rancho Paseana property in Rancho Santa Fe, California.'","Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates paid $18 million for the San Diego ranch that wasn't even on the market .

"Firefighters in a small New Jersey town have come under attack from officials and residents after hanging a banner reading: 'Show us your t**s.' The all-volunteer team displayed the lewd sign below the Williamstown Fire Company's emblem at the state's Fireman's Convention in Wildwood last weekend. Former EMT Shawn Rutter saw the sign at the event and sent a photo to the South Jersey Times. Scroll down for video . Offensive: The Williamstown Fire Company posted this sign asking women to show them their breasts at a firefighters' convention at the weekend. Residents have expressed their shock at the poor choice . 'I think it's demoralizing to women,' Rutter told the paper. 'I think it's insulting. A lot of young kids idolize that type of work. Every little kid wants to be a firefighter. A lot of parents drive their kids to that parade. That's not a conducive learning environment.' The mayor of the South Jersey town, who has called for suspensions of those responsible for the poor choice, said it did not represent the Gloucester County town the right way. 'We're investigating,' Monroe Township Mayor Michael Gabbianelli told NBC4. 'Somebody will be suspended when we find out all the answers. It's embarrassing for everybody.' Residents said they were horrified when they saw the sign. Not impressed: Monroe Township Mayor Michael Gabbianelli, pictured, said an investigation was underway to determine who was responsible and that there would be suspensions once they got to the bottom of it . 'I thought it was completely inappropriate and distasteful and I was shocked,' Rebecca Budney, a Williamstown resident, told the channel. Others said the firefighters had set a terrible example. 'When kids see it and they pick it up and they go around saying it to girls - it's not good,' said another resident, Heather Camperchioli. Rutter, who snapped the photo, added: 'I commend everybody that's a policeman or fireman or EMT. But I think somebody made a bad call and it needs to not happen again.' After the outcry, President Joseph Kurz and Chief Michael Jacobi from the fire company posted an apology on its website beneath a picture of the words 'So Sorry' written in sand. 'We would like to offer the fire company's sincere apologies to those who were offended by the inappropriate banner,' their statement read.

"The first TV commercials showing electronic cigarettes will be shown from November 10, it was announced yesterday. However, the adverts will not be allowed to target young people and no actor in an ad may look as if they are aged under 25. The guidance set down by the advertising regulator clears the way for e-cigarette manufacturers to market their product as openly as drinks producers, who are also banned from linking alcohol with youth or youth culture. The first TV commercials showing electronic cigarettes will be shown from November 10 . While the advertising of e-cigarettes on TV is currently allowed, the device itself must not appear on screen. Under the new rules the Committee of Advertising Practice will allow e-cigarettes to be promoted by association with glamour and sexual success – themes off-limits to drinks advertisers. The CAP report said the rules for e-cigarettes should be more liberal because they 'present only some of the same concerns as alcohol and gambling and crucially there are strong arguments for the public health benefits of e-cigarettes'. Health campaigners gave a cautious welcome but said the long-term effects of e-smoking remain unknown and further restrictions may be necessary in future. More than two million Britons regularly use e-cigarettes. E-cig firm challenges EU directive because of regulation fears . A leading UK electronic cigarette company has launched a legal battle over a European Union directive it fears will lead to stringent new regulations and stifle the market. A High Court judge has agreed to Totally Wicked taking its case to the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) in Luxembourg. The company argues the EU Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) breaches EU law in seeking to regulate e-cigarettes, despite the fact they contain no tobacco. E-cigarette company Totally Wicked has launched a legal battle over a European Union directive it fears will lead to stringent new regulations and stifle the market . Mr Justice Green, sitting in London, said the case should be sent to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling on the legality of the directive. A hearing is expected next year. Totally Wicked's managing director Fraser Cropper said Article 20 of the directive would result in e-cigarettes being subjected to a stricter regulatory regime than some tobacco products. He said: 'Not only is this article therefore disproportionate, we believe it is also contrary to established EU law. 'It is therefore vitally important that the UK court has decided that the CJEU should make a ruling on the lawfulness of Article 20. 'For the sake of e-cigarette users and potential users, it is vital that our industry is allowed to mature within a proportionate regulatory framework, which supports appropriate controls and safety requirements, and necessary social responsibility and continues to provide consumer choice to maximise the enormous potential of these products. 'Article 20 of this directive patently will not deliver this environment.' Susan Garrett, partner with law firm Addleshaw Goddard, which is mounting the challenge, said: 'Totally Wicked believes that the Tobacco Products Directive is a misconceived and disproportionate attempt to regulate electronic cigarettes. 'Today's decision is a key milestone for our client, given the impact it believes the directive will have in stifling this emerging market.'","Commercials showing electronic cigarettes will be shown from November 10 .

"MMA fighter Cody Gibson told a man to Google his name before being punched in the face and knocked to the ground at a Las Vegas bar. The 27-year-old, nicknamed 'The Renegade', was captured on video in an altercation with another man, wagging his fists after the man had pushed him to the floor. Gibson had already lost a fight that night, to Manny Gamburyan at UFC 178, and he found himself on the floor again after saying: 'Google me, b****'.

Record: 12 wins, five defeats . He was caught with a right hook before attempting to lift the assailant to the floor. The two grappled but the fight was broken up before the situation got out of hand and Gibson had a chance to use full force. Gibson spoke of his regret about the incident the next day on Sherdog Radio. He said: 'When I woke up this morning, I definitely had that pit in the bottom of my stomach, like, ""Holy c***. Could I be that guy?"" You know, who gets fired over some stupid stuff. Gibson was floored, but then got up and lifted the man from the floor and took him down . A few onlookers got involved before the fight was broken up before any real damage was done . 'This guy was being a typical kind of bro and started saying some stuff to me. At first, I told him I did not want to fight, two or three times. 'He was definitely egging on the situation, and then he started to irritate me,' said Gibson, who said he was intoxicated. 'Then I told him who I was, which was probably the worst idea, because then, after that, I feel like he really wanted to fight.'

"Bumper crop: Warm weather has led to a huge harvest of blackberries this year . Blackberry farmers are expecting a bumper crop of super-sweet fruits this year thanks to the warm weather. Growers have harvested 1,123 tonnes already compared to 808 this time last year and expect to net 2,000 tonnes by the end of the season, nearly double more than last autumn. Experts say the abundant harvest is due to ideal growing conditions during mild weather last winter and a long and settled summer. Industry body British Summer Fruits said blackberries emerged around a month earlier than expected with an abundance of large, succulent fruit still to be picked. Chairman Laurence Olins said growers are also using new technology to breed sweeter varieties. He said: ‘British consumers are some of the luckiest in the world when it comes to blackberries as the UK is at the forefront of new technologies and breeding methods, resulting in exceptional quality, flavourful fruit. ‘Our growers have seen the market grow substantially in recent years, by more than 70 per cent in the last decade.’ The remarkable autumn weather is set to run and run, with a glorious weekend in store. Temperatures in the south could hit 23C (73F) tomorrow (Sunday) with highs of 21C (70F) elsewhere, forecasters said. The temperatures are way above the 16C (61F) daytime average for September. There will be a misty start today and tomorrow - but the fogs will clear to leave a glorious, sunny and dry weekend for most parts of the country. High temperatures all around the country (pictured: Cambridge) have led to the high blackberry numbers . Warm weather is due to set in tomorrow, and should stay dry into October apart from a brief storm on Monday. Pictured here: Trebah Gardens near Falmouth, Cornwall, where the garden is still in wonderful bloom thanks to the warm weather . A storm will blow in on Monday in southern parts - the result of the warm weather on Sunday - but it will quickly clear. Matt Dobson, forecaster at MeteoGroup, said: ‘This is pretty amazing weather for September. ‘After a really warm weekend we will have some storms in the south on Monday - but once we get past that we will have a lot more fine and dry weather. ‘It is looking like it will last until the beginning of October, which is quite remarkable.’ Met Office spokeswoman Laura Young said: ‘Temperatures will be above average for the next week thanks to high pressure prevailing over the south. ‘There cold be some fog around on Saturday morning mainly in the south east and across the West Country sand maybe Wales.’ Leon Brown, forecaster for The Weather Channel UK, added: ‘There is a fine and mainly dry weekend ahead, away from the far north, and becoming quite warm in the south.’","Warmer than average weather expected to lead to huge blackberry crop .

"A rookie New York cop attacked by a hatchet-wielding maniac has taken his first steps unassisted as he continues a slow but steady recovery from his hospital bed. Officer Kenneth Healey, 25, is believed to have taken a few steps around his hospital room without the aid of a walker. The rookie NYPD officer was rushed to hospital after being bludgeoned in the back of the head by Zale Thompson last Thursday, in an unprovoked attack targeting himself and three other officers he was with. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . Police sources have said Officer Kenneth Healey is now improving and his condition 'progressing nicely' The New York Post cited police sources as saying his condition was now improving. The source said: 'He’s progressing nicely. He’s getting stronger and better. Every day he has a better frame of mind — and his spirits are getting higher. 'He wants to get better so he can go back to being a police officer like his dad.' A number of fundraising sites have also emerged online for visitors to donate or simply pass on messages of goodwill. Meanwhile, a chilling picture has been released showing Officer Healey and his three colleagues in Queens, taken seconds before they were ambushed. Officer Kenneth Healey, 25, and his three comrades are all smiles in a portrait taken by Dominick Williams last Thursday afternoon. Mr Williams spotted the officers and asked them to stand for a picture.

The other officers opened fire, killing Thompson but also accidentally shooting and gravely wounding a bystander who was caught in the crossfire. Mr Williams' camera captured the frantic aftermath of the attack. Officer Healey - who had just four months on the job - can be seen laying face down on the sidewalk - a bloody gash in his head. Another officer can be seen tending to his fallen comrade, holding a cloth over the gushing wound in his head.

"It seems when it comes to problems faced on a daily basis, Australians have quite a unique collection to complain about. From spiders popping up in all sorts of unexpected spots around the house, snakes setting up camp in the backyard to kangaroos battling it out in boxing matches in the streets many strange things happen in the land Down Under.

Many social media users expressed their disbelief over the wild Australian weather, following this spring snowstorm in the NSW Blue Mountains last week . The fact that the country is very expensive also pops up a lot, with many people venting over the fact that shipping something to the 'island' can be more expensive that the goods purchased. Quinn shared their angst writing: '#Aussieproblems ordering something online and paying more for shipping than the item cost'. Overcook Aussie meals, the cost of interstate travel, the lack of Netflix and the omnipresence of wildlife also got many users going.

Wacky weather was another common complaint, with posts about the fact that one day the country can be battered with torrential rain while the next it could be sunny again.

"A farmer who was offered £1million to put a wind turbine on his land turned it down because he said it would blight the 'beautiful and unspoilt' countryside. But now Tony Dallyn, 54, who farms in a Devon valley made famous by Michael Morpugo's smash hit, War Horse, faces having to see the towering device anyway, because his neighbour has agreed to host the 251ft turbine instead. And while it wouldn't have been visible to Mr Dallyn if he'd agreed to site it on his land, the proposed device will now be just 450ft away and highly visible from his house if neighbouring farmer, Martin Goddard, wins planning permission for it. Devon farmer Tony Dallyn, 54, of Loosedown Barton, near Winkleigh, turned down £1million for wind turbine . Filming War Horse: Mr Dallyn said it was a 'life-changing amount' but he didn't want to 'blight the landscape' Mr Dallyn, who inherited his 1,800-acre farm from his parents in 1961, says he received offers from companies Murex and MI Grid to allow them to site a 500kW turbine on his Loosedon Barton farm. He said he was told the device could earn him between £35,000 and £50,000 a year, or up to £1million over 20 years, but decided to say no as he would not be able to 'look people in the eye' if he destroyed the land near the Okement Valley, where War Horse author, Michael Morpugo, set his book. He said: 'The papers were on the table ready to be signed to give a company a two-year option, but we decided we just could not inflict such a turbine upon our neighbours and wider community. 'It would have been a life-changing amount of money which could have financed the next step of the business, but the turbine would have towered above the hillside and been a huge blight on the landscape. 'I didn't want to be responsible - our farm is visible from everywhere north of Dartmoor and Okehampton into North Devon.' Then Mr Dallyn discovered Mr Goddard's plans for a near-identical 250ft turbine on his land next door. Around 100 local residents are objecting . to the proposed turbine, including Mr Dallyn and Mr Morpurgo, 70, who . has become the public figurehead for the valley's battle against . turbines, describing them as a threat to its 'oasis of peace and . wonder'. Spielberg hit: The 2011 War Horse film was shot near around the Okement Valley, near Mr Dallyn's land . Rolling hills: Michael Morpugo's book, which became a theatre production and a movie, was filmed in Devon . Mr Morpugo wrote in a letter to the local authority: 'We will have a random scattering of thousands of these huge wind turbines all over Devon, all over our countryside... 'If our democracy means anything, this should not and must not be allowed.' The plans are currently under appeal after being rejected unanimously by Winkleigh Parish Council and refused planning permission by Torridge District Council. Mr Dallyn, who grows wheat and barley on his farm and hopes to pass the business on to his son, added: 'It is a lot of money to turn down, and I can understand why some people would take it. 'I just feel I would like to leave my small patch of England as beautiful and unspoilt as it was when I inherited it.' Mr Dallyn inherited the farm near Winkleigh from his parents in 1961, and hopes to pass it on to his son . Property developers began eyeing the Devon landscape last year after identifying it as a good location for a battery of new turbines, but campaigners warned the projects could ruin the scenery and wreck the tourist industry which inspired by War Horse. A recent map drawn up by the Campaign to Protect Rural England revealed 11 turbines are currently in planning, with another nine in the pipeline.","Devon landowner Tony Dallyn, 54, says he had offers from two companies .

"She's the darling of the French film scene, a successful model and the brains behind her own philanthropic foundation. Now Elisa Sednaoui has revealed that she's determined to ensure that poverty-stricken Egyptian girls get the education they deserve - and has teamed up with shoe supremo Christian Louboutin to make it happen. But there's more to Sednaoui than acting and charity campaigns. A self-confessed nerd, she says that the current trend for teenage girls to value looks over brains is worrying and she hopes that they will realise that in life, intelligence is just as important as good looks. Values: French actress Elisa Sednaoui says it's time to stop obsessing about looks and start valuing brains . 'Life always ends up teaching us, one way or another, that without depth, beauty is worth very little,' she explains in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'It's much better to start being curious and asking questions about the world early on. Education is everything.' The mother of a one-year-old son Jack, Sednaoui is outspoken about raising her son to respect women - and would even describe herself a feminist. 'I am a feminist in the sense that I believe that women are entitled the same rights and opportunities as men and are of equal value,' she says firmly. 'I will always be grateful to those women who fought for this, as I feel completely equal and I will do all I can to help women around the world to achieve the same.' Successful: Self-confessed nerd Elisa says that much of her success is down to using her brain . Passion: The Elisa Sednaoui Foundation aims to provide supplementary education for Egypt's poorest people . To that end, she has set up the Elisa Sednaoui Foundation, which provides after-school tuition to girls and boys in Egypt - a country close to the part-Egyptian Sednaoui's heart. 'In Egypt, women can work outside the home, go to school and university, and are free to vote or run in elections,' she explains. 'But in education and the labour market, women still lag behind. Women are four times more likely to be unemployed than men.' Keeping track of women's progress in the country is difficult because, as Sednaoui points out, the majority either work at home or have an informal role in the work place. This is something that she hopes to fix and to that end, she is currently working on a campaign to raise awareness of their plight and funds to support her foundation's work - all with a little help from Louboutin. Helpful friends: Christian Louboutin has joined Elisa in her latest campaign to boost the profile of her charity . Exciting stuff: Elisa hopes that her charity will be able to help more children go to school like this group . Together, the pair are running a social media campaign which encourages women to post pictures of themselves and their shoes on Instagram and make a donation at the same time. Those with the most exciting pair of shoes will be entered into a competition to win an all-expenses paid trip to Paris to tour Louboutin's studio, escorted by Sednaoui. Her charitable ambitions, always bubbling under the surface, have become more urgent since becoming a mother in part, she says, because of the way parenthood has turned her into a more empathetic person. 'Becoming a mother has given me more empathy,' she beams. 'More understanding, more tolerance with myself and others. Its a thrilling experience to rediscover the world through his eyes' Nevertheless, despite being a good example of a woman who has used her brains as well as her beauty to get ahead, she remains concerned about the way celebrity is fetishised and seen as an end in itself by today's teenagers. 'Celebrity is by no means a goal in itself,' she says. 'Unfortunately I feel young people are confused about this today. 'The most important is being able to do what makes you happy - not having a paparazzi chasing you.' Big plans: Elisa, who says becoming a mother made her more empathetic, says celebrity is not a real goal . Set up to provide creative after-school activities to deprived Egyptian children, the Elisa Sednaoui Foundation is now an important part of the actress' life. Focusing on cultural exchange and life skills, the charity aims to give girls' education a boost in a country where many women still lack the life chances of their male counterparts. Celebrity supporters include Christian Louboutin, who has teamed up with Elisa for a new campaign to raise funds for the charity, and is offering a prize of an all-expenses paid trip to his Paris atelier, a signed pair of stilettos and a luxury spa experience for one lucky winner.

"A pensioner who has spent years verbally abusing staff at her local Post Office has finally been banned - after she was dubbed the 'rudest woman they have ever met'. Angry Elizabeth Smith, 70, can no longer pick up her pension from her branch after she was barred for life her regular tirades. Workers at the rural Post Office say Elizabeth has been using the shop since 2007 - and is always rude to counter staff. They say she is 'unpleasant' and regularly 'shouts and screams' and subjects customers and postal employees to 'unfounded abuse'. Elizabeth Smith, 70, has been banned from her local post office for life in Porthleven, Cornwall, after staff say she spent years verbally abusing them . Elizabeth has been using the shop since 2007 and regularly complains about a number of issues including prices and her pension . Paul Edwards, the postmaster in Porthleven, Cornwall, says she is 'very, very rude' and has finally tired of her antics - and banned her for life. But the decision won’t come as much of a surprise to Elizabeth - she’s already barred from four local shops, including the cafe and the garden centre. Mr Edwards said: 'She is very, very rude woman. She comes in and shouts and abuses my staff and they don’t need it.'She’s the sort of woman you can’t reason with. I don’t want her in the store upsetting the staff. I’m afraid it’s gone on too long. 'She even said she would never set foot in here ever again but every other day she was back in here shouting and screaming. 'We have worked really hard to make the store friendly and I think it was for the best that we banned her. 'She is the rudest woman we have ever come across, and I stand by that. She is quite a well-known person. The 70-year-old was banned after a row over a £10 phone top-up . Elizabeth has been using the shop since 2007 and regularly complains about a number of issues including prices and her pension. But things finally came to head last week after she launched a tirade of verbal abuse over a failed mobile phone top-up. She became embroiled in a row at the store when she realised a £10 phone credit top-up had failed. But despite phone company EE accepting it was at fault and even double her money as a goodwill gesture, the pensioner continued to blame the Post Office. Paul said: 'She was shouting at . everyone that we had conned her and were rip-off merchants. It’s just . not good for staff or our customers. Lizzie says it's 'ridiculous' to find herself banned from the post office, but admits she 'did get a bit cross' 'She . staged various sit ins and shouted abuse at everybody. She came back . and shouted unfounded abuse when we have explained to her that it was . Orange that were at fault. 'The last straw was when she started telling everybody who came into the store we were rip-off merchants and conmen.' Mrs Smith admits she 'gets a bit cross' but says the ban is unnecessary. She said: 'I was told I must not walk across the floor from the door to the post office counter as I’m ‘trespassing’. I’m barred from the shop. 'They said, ‘If you don’t get out we’ll call the police’. I’m 70, with a stick and a dodgy ticker - I wouldn’t take a lot of evicting would I? 'I did get a bit cross I must admit. The following week I went in to get my pension in the normal way and the postmaster started shouting at me. All this over £10 - it’s ridiculous.'","Elizabeth Smith 70, has been banned for life from the post office in Porthleven, Cornwall .

Instead of which she still looks better than most women half her age, even when she's at her roughest. Following Kate's lead: The model manages to look good the morning after the night before . Those of us who aren't species supermodel have to try a little harder. I have a friend who swears by a mouthful of ice cubes first thing in the morning: wakes you up and de-puffs, apparently. My dentist, meanwhile, has some rather more scientific advice: always use ibuprofen for a hangover, never paracetamol: apparently the latter is processed via the liver, which has enough on its plate breaking down the excess alcohol. The ibuprofen, by contrast, leaves via the kidneys. So it's true: the best way of preventing a hangover is a large glass of water and two Nurofen before bed. Personally, I swear by milk thistle. I take a course of it twice a year, once in the summer and once at Christmas, and I'm convinced it makes a difference. Well, it must do, because I had my liver function checked recently and it's tip top - despite the fact that I'm 2st overweight and partial to the odd G&T. A happy liver is key to most things. It will clear up dark circles under the eyes, and also stop your skin from taking on that grey-ish tinge that’s associated with the occasional bout of excess. It also helps things enormously if you choose your poison. Did you know, for example, that the paler the drink, the gentler the hangover? That's because dark-coloured drinks - red wine, whisky, rum - contain higher levels of congeners, which are the natural by-products of fermentation, and give you hangovers. Nutritionist Amelia Freer takes the sensible holistic approach. Her response is to work on building up reserves from within through sustained healthy eating before, after and during your vacation. Make sure your holiday diet doesn't just consist of a packet of salt and vinegar crips and a slice of pizza. Eat plenty of dark greens (spinach, kale, broccoli etc), onions, garlic, tomatoes and peppers. All these encourage the production of glutathione in the body, a powerful antioxidant that helps support the liver. The other problem with having that extra tipple is that it increases inflammation in the body. So avoid inflammatory foods such as wheat and sugar, and fill up on things like avocado, oily fish and nuts. As to make-up, my biggest problem is usually bleariness from not taking off my mascara properly, sleeping in my contact lenses (I always know it's been a good night when I wake up able to see properly) or stabbing myself in the eye with the cotton wool. For this there is really no better remedy than Optrex straight from the fridge. Cucumbers work, of course; but if that's not practical, try Boots Cucumber Eye Gel (£1): very effective and quite possibly cheaper in the long run. If you've got time, a little lie-down with an Alka-Seltzer and a cooling eye mask works wonders (also for hay fever sufferers): try the Aqua Eye Mask (£6) from Body Shop. If you're beach-bound, you probably won't feel like caking much on the day after - Kate certainly doesn't bother. A quick slap in the chops with something invigorating always helps, though, to wit Liz Earle's Cleanse & Polish Hot Cloth Cleanser (from £8.50). It's the eucalyptus in this that does it for me. Finally, for those with deep pockets, Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Cream (£70) is the actual product that the actual Kate Moss uses. Tilbury being Moss's go-to make-up artist, she has plenty of experience of being handed a weary, worn-out party girl and transforming her into a hot-to-trot supermodel. Then it's just a case of a large pair of sunnies, a slick of lippie, a truck-load of attitude - and off you go. Mind that step, now. The all-in-one hair wash is back . 12-in-one: Grow Gorgeous is a cleanser and conditioner with a host of other effects . 'Take two bottles into the shower? Not me... I just want to Wash And Go!' Remember that? You must be as old as me then. Vidal Sassoon's all-in-one shampoo and conditioner was the archetypal product for the yuppie decade. After all, if Gordon Gekko thought lunch was for wimps, imagine what he would have made of hair conditioner? Thirty years on, and the one-bottle hair trend is back. Only this time it's known as co-washing. Sounds like one of those Gwyneth Paltrow-style euphemisms; in fact it's just short for conditioning wash. Essentially, it's washing your hair in a souped-up conditioner in order to remove dirt and grease without stripping the hair of its natural oils. African and Afro-Caribbean women will probably already be familiar with it, as will those with very curly hair. But in this age of straighteners and curlers and rainbow colours, co-washing has become more mainstream, as it offers the ideal solution to the difficulties of caring for over-treated hair. Nevertheless, it's best suited to thick or curly hair, although if your mop is colour treated, or if it's had a lot of sun exposure this year, you may also want to give it a go. If you like that audible feeling of squeaky cleanliness, though, avoid. And if you suffer from dandruff or psoriasis, check with your dermatologist beforehand. CRUSH... Words like 'miracle' and 'flawless' are often bandied around in the beauty industry, but in the case of Yves Saint Laurent Fusion Ink Foundation, they're justified. £30.50, www.yslbeauty.co.uk. FAIL... Do we really need to see reality star Millie Mackintosh's facemask, below? Enough already with the selfies! If you're one of those sporty types who washes their hair daily, try to limit your co-washes to three a week, and use a gentle, sulphate-free shampoo in-between. And be careful if you have hair-extensions: the added oils may loosen the connections. Needless to say, the number of co-washing products on the market is growing almost hourly. Here's the pick of the current crop... Grow Gorgeous: A new 12-in-one cleanser/conditioner, no less, promising volume as well as shine, softness, smoothness and a host of other miraculous effects. £19.29, Boots.

"An 18-year-old man has been arrested and charged for dressing up as a police officer three times to question a couple about an alleged domestic abuse case. Max Sapirman was called upon by his girlfriend's mother, who asked him to dress as a cop and interrogate her friend's allegedly abusive husband. He donned a navy shirt and baseball cap emblazoned with Suffolk County Police Department badges, plus a gun strap to call at the home in Deer Park, Long Island. Busted: Max Sapirman, 18, is pictured in his makeshift police gear which he wore to interrogate a couple . Both the husband and the wife, who have not been named, claim they believed him to be a bonafide officer, despite the fact that his makeshift uniform does not match that worn by the SCPD. He arrived on the doorstep at 8.30pm on September 15 and again on September 16, ordering the husband to leave the property on both occasions for a night. On a third visit, on September 20, he dropped by again but did not order the husband to leave, the force said in a statement. Each time, he asked the woman if she wanted him to arrest her husband but she declined. Arrested: He now faces the charge of second-degree criminal impersonation and will be arraigned on Friday . This Tuesday, more than a month later, the wife discovered Sapirman was an impostor and called 911. He was arrested at home in Deer Park on Thursday at around 8.05pm. He has been charged with second-degree criminal impersonation and will appear in court on Friday. Police have also issued an appeal for anyone else that believes Sapirman contacted them to come forward.","Max Sapirman, 18, asked by girlfriend's mother to interrogate her friends .

"French comedian Remi Gaillard has been accused of glorifying sex attacks with a video he posted online in which he appears to be simulating sex with unsuspecting women . A French comedian has been accused of glorifying sex attacks after posting a video online in which he appears to be simulating sex with unsuspecting women. Remi Gaillard, 39, has provoked criticism for the 'air sex' video in which he uses careful camera angles to make it appear he is miming intercourse with women without their knowledge. The online comedian however has defended the film, insisting all of the women involved gave their consent for the footage to be published and pointing out how the media is 'feasting' on the video. The film has so far gained more than 4.5million views on YouTube, but former health minister Roselyne Bachelot described it as 'glorifying rape', The Independent reported. Writer Dom Bochel Guegan wrote on the website of French magazine Nouvel Observateur that the video is a 'trivialisation of the sexual violence of which we have been or will be one day the victim of.' She noted the response on Gaillard's Facebook page was mixed, with his defenders being 'very, very much guys, which is to say people who have never been solely considered as being a sexual object.' Another viewer wrote in a tweet: 'Dear Remi Gaillard, keeping up rape culture is not funny. It's deplorable.' French TV presenter Audrey Pulvar meanwhile called Mr Gaillard a 'miserable jerk' and said his film exploited the 'constant sexual aggression' faced by women in public.

He also points out one of the 'victims' in the video is a male police officer and pleads: 'Please let these women have the right to freedom of thought and the right to make use of their image as they see fit.' He goes on to write: 'Women are not objects, and yet, the media is feasting on this humourous video.'

"A devastated mother has revealed her daughters' school threatened her with court after the girls missed class to spend time with their terminally ill father. Teenagers Lydia and Leah Vaughan were last week at the bedside of their dying father, Martin, 40, after he was rushed to hospital after his cancer spread. But their mother Nicolette was then sent a letter by their school threatening legal action for unauthorised absences. Shocking: A school threatened Nicolette Vaughan with legal action after children Leah and Lydia missed classes to be with their terminally ill father . Bereft:  Lydia and Leah with their father Martin who has been battling cancer, which's now spread to his liver . She had kept Bispham High School in Blackpool, Lancashire, informed of her husband's illness since his first diagnosis in 2010 and had told them it had spread to his liver and was terminal. But the school still sent out the threatening letter and have since apologised for their heavy-handed approach. Mother-of-three Nicolette, 37, said: 'Martin has been battling cancer and it has been diagnosed as terminal - the school is fully aware of all this. 'On March 24 he was rushed by ambulance into hospital in absolute agony, a disturbing and upsetting sight the girls both bravely witnessed. 'I rang the school and left a message explaining everything that had happened and I didn't know when the girls would be back as everything was up in the air. 'Despite this I was sent a text asking where they were. I was furious. 'The school states that unless the circumstances are exceptional poor attendance is not tolerated - what is more exceptional than your father dying of cancer? 'I can't emphasise enough how thoroughly disgusted I am with the schools complete lack of support or even empathy for my girls.' Apology: The headteacher at Bispham has said sorry to the family but said it is trying to drive up attendance . She said she has been contacted on a number of other occasions to query  absences. Last month Ashbrook Junior School in Derbyshire,has been accused of imposing a Victorian punishment regime after it secretly forced its pupils to wear a humiliating ‘I am going to the toilet' sign. Staff at  made ten and 11-year-olds march to the lavatory with a label round their necks to improve discipline. Riley Pearson, six, from near Slough, was suspended from his school after he took a bag of Mini Cheddars in his packed lunch before later being expelled for more food related problems. Colnbrook C of E Primary School insisted he was not excluded 'for just having Mini Cheddars in their lunchbox' but because there had been a 'persistent and deliberate breach of school policy, such as bringing in crisps, biscuits, sausage rolls, mini sausages, scotch eggs and similar'. Jordan Cobby, from Nuneaton, was diagnosed with a tumour behind his eye in 2008 and died aged 14. Tribute wristbands in his memory were sold at his school, the Nuneaton Academy, following his death, with all proceeds donated charity. But the school banned pupils from wearing them saying they are not part of the uniform. The school - which was placed in special measures last year - has now apologised and said the letter was sent out in error. They accepted that Lydia should never have been on their attendance initiative list. Martin, a panel beater, was diagnosed with cancer four years ago when doctors discovered a tumour the size of a golf ball behind his eye. In 2012 he was told the tragic news the cancer had spread to his liver and was terminal. The couple's son Caleb, 17, also attended the school. Acting school head Deborah Hanlon-Catlow said: 'I am very sorry Mrs Vaughan received this letter, which was sent out in error. 'The school is committed to helping families whose children have poor attendance, and has targeted support for a number of children. 'As part of our drive to improve attendance, letters were sent out to specific parents - unfortunately, Mrs Vaughan has received this letter as well when it did not apply to her or her family. 'As soon as we realised the mistake, the letter was rescinded and the school has apologised directly to the family for any distress caused. 'I am well aware of the difficult situation the family is facing and the school is supporting the pupils through what must be a very upsetting time.' The school has had a troubled year after being placed in special measures by Ofsted inspectors.","Lydia and Leah Vaughan missed class to be with their dying father Martin .

"They may be forged in a pina colada-fuelled, sun-drenched atmosphere but holiday friendships rarely last beyond the end of the trip, according to new research. Some holidaymakers even give fake phone numbers to avoid being pestered by their newfound friends once back home, reveals the survey. Of 2,000 people surveyed, 58 per cent said they regularly made friends when away but only 6 per cent managed to keep the friendships going for as long as a month after returning home. Best friends forever? A new survey has revealed that while 58 per cent of holidaymakers regularly make friends when they're away, only 6 per cent keep in touch with them . Also, 59 per cent admitted to contacting their new friends just the once after the trip. Around 22 per cent gave out false phone numbers to deter further contact. But 38 per cent said they went on holidays especially to form new friendships, with 1 per cent even eventually marrying their new friend. Will they stay in touch? The survey also found that 59 per cent of holidaymakers admitted to contacting their new friends just the once after the trip . The poll showed Londoners are the most pally when on a trip, with 83 per cent making friends every time they go away. Next most-matey are the Welsh, followed by West Midlanders.

"This is the moment a pet dog catches a giant rat in his mouth, amid warnings the disease-carrying rodents are surging in numbers around the UK. Jack Russell, Max, grabbed one of the extra-large rats during a walk in a park in the Kent town of Royal Tunbridge Wells. Pest controllers around the country have reported increasing numbers of the over-sized vermin, which are growing as big as cats on fatty foods and developing an immunity to traditional poisons. Jack Russell, Max, owned by Royal Tunbridge Wells resident Mark Willmott, caught one of the large rats whose numbers are increasing around the country . The problem had been mainly confined to large cities, but Royal Tunbridge Wells resident Mark Willmott was shocked to see his dog Max emerge from bushes with one the creatures in his mouth during a walk in local park, Southborough Common. Mr Wilmott, 50, said: 'I've never seen a rat that big in my life. When I saw my dog come out of the bushes with it I was shocked that something like that was living so close to where people live.' His daughter, Lexie O'Hara, 20, described the rat as 'terrifyingly big'. It comes as residents in the town report an increase in sightings of the extra-large rodents, with some fearing their numbers could lead to a spread in disease. Peter Vincent told local paper, The Kent and Sussex Courier: 'It’s disease. Rats carry everything, absolutely everything. Residents in Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent have reported a surge in the numbers of over-sized rats . He added: 'This was the cause of the plague. They killed half the population in Medieval times. We need to get to grips with responsibility with this.' It has been suggested the rats are using the disused ABC cinema in the town as a breeding ground. A spokesman for Tunbridge Wells Borough Council played down the claims of an increase in numbers today. But she insisted the council has moved to tackle any rodents living in the former cinema. The spokesman said: 'The empty cinema site in the town centre is due to be demolished and we have imposed strict conditions on the owners about how they must use specialist contractors to eradicate, not displace, any vermin before demolition.' The picturesque spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells, near the border between Kent and Sussex, is a popular retreat for wealthy Londoners and is famous for its 'Pantiles' Georgian walkway. Pest controllers have seen an increase in the numbers of huge rats, which experts say are growing fat on junk food thrown away by humans . The town's rat fears come just days after pest controllers in Birmingham reported more than 5,000 sightings of large rats, some as big as cats, in the past year. Dr Robin Allaby, professor in evolutionary genetics at Warwick University, has said the increase in size is probably down to high-sugar and fatty foods now thrown away by humans . He said: 'Humans have got bigger with nutrition and it's a quite likely explanation for rats as well.' Earlier this year, pest control experts warned that rats are mutating and developing an immunity to tradition poisons. The pesticides wipe out weaker animals, meaning that those that survive are able to withstand increasing amounts of poison. David Cross, from pest control firm Rentokil, said the biggest rats still live in rural environments and grow large by eating animal feed meant for bulking-up livestock. He added: 'Rats, much like the rest of us, are focused on finding food and shelter. 'Once they find a good supply of food and the environment is favourable, they'll end up staying there and can grow to a decent size. 'One way to control the spread of these creatures is to go back to basics and not give them the ideal conditions in which to thrive. 'Simple things like ensuring that food waste is properly disposed of can make a big difference in cutting their food supply, while sealing any obvious holes in the exterior of your property with wire wool or caulk should stop them entering your home.'","Jack Russell, Max, caught one of the huge rats spotted around Britain .

"An Ohio mother was jailed Tuesday night after allegedly forcing her way into her daughter's middle school and attacking a student she believed was bullying her child. Irea Nall, 29, has been charged with assault in connection to an incident that took place last week at Groveport Madison Middle School South in Franklin County. According to police, Nall marched down to the school and slipped through the front door equipped with a camera and buzzer as another visitor was leaving. Out of control: Irea Nall, 29, has been charged with assault for allegedly storming into her daughter's middle school and attacking her suspected bully . Emergency: Staffers at Groveport Madison Middle School South refused to buzz Nall in after she declined to show her ID, but the woman was able to slip in as another visitor was leaving the building . Bad role model: Police say the mother of two jumped on a cafeteria table, kicked at food and struck a student on the head with a bottle . The mother proceeded to scream at school staff and allegedly pushed away a dean who confronted her about her conduct, Columbus Dispatch reported. The school has a system in place that requires all visitors to show an ID and speak with a security guard before being escorted to the main office, but Nall reportedly disregarded all the safety procedures. As teachers began to evacuate the building in accordance with the school safety protocol, Nall made her way to the cafeteria, police said. Once in the lunchroom, Nall jumped on a table, kicked some of the children's meals to the floor and walked to a girl that her daughter had accused of being a bully. But the mother ended up hitting another student on the head with a bottle. The confrontation also left an administrator injured after he fell trying to stop Nall. Behind bars: Nall, who also has a younger son (right), turned herself in over the weekend . The mother eventually left the building with her daughter in tow. According to the school, the girl has not been subjected to any bullying. Nall turned herself in last Sunday and was charged with assault, inciting panic and aggravated trespassing. Her young daughter also faces one count of disorderly conduct. The 29-year-old woman, who also has a younger son, has been documenting her ordeal on her Facebook page, where she shared her mugshot, lamenting that police had not used a more attractive photo of her.

Nall's neighbor Sandy Pack told NBC4i she was stunned by the charges against the mother of two, whom she described as a good parent. ‘I am just wondering what really made her trigger go off,’ Miss Pack said. ‘There has to be some reason why, because she is very protective of her children.’","Irea Nall, 29, charged with assault, inciting panic and aggravated trespassing on Groveport Madison Middle School South property .

"Pastor and father-of-two Alan Martin set the bar high when he was bestowed with a 'Never-Ending-Pasta-Pass' six weeks ago: He planned to eat at the restaurant each day, twice a day. It's a challenge that might have defeated even the most voracious eaters but Mr Martin, from North Carolina, is on track - eating 95 meals at Olive Garden over the past six weeks. And with the pass costing just $100, the Olive Garden fan has already made his money back 15 times over - but insisted he has not gained any weight. Scroll down for video .

Alan Martin (pictured on Tuesday) has been eating Olive Garden for the past six weeks on the never-ending-pasta-pass at a restaurant in Burlington, North Carolina . With the pass costing just $100, the Olive Garden fan has made his money back 15 times over - but insisted he has not gained any weight (pictured here before the challenge) Now nothing will put him off his plan to continue eating Olive Garden twice a day until the deal runs out on November 9. Mr Martin considers himself something of a celebrity at his local Olive Garden in Burlington, where he chows down a bowl of pasta for lunch and dinner - with extra cheese - each day. He greets those steaming pasta entrees with the words: 'Hello friend.' But the pastor dreams big, telling Fox 8: 'I would love to be the person that ate the most of the 1,000 people. That would be a good contest to win. Because that means I got the most value out of the card of anyone in the United States.' When he bought the pass back in September, he told the news station that he didn't mind if he put on weight because of the money he would have saved. Mr Martin said that he hadn't had enough of pasta yet but by the end of the seven weeks, he would probably want a burger or pizza. Only 1,000 of the passes were made available and covered a 150 combinations of pasta and sauce at the Italian food chain . Mr Martin knows exactly how many bowls of pasta he has consumed over six weeks as he has kept every receipt from the challenge . It was a carb-loading dream when Olive Garden announced the 'never-ending pasta pass' in September - which sold out in 45 minutes. The $100 golden ticket has allowed Olive Garden fans to fill up on as much of the chain's signature dishes as they can eat. Fans of the chain were able to buy a ticket to eat as much pasta as possible for seven weeks between September 22 and November 9. Only 1,000 of the passes were sold and covered the 150 combinations of pasta and sauce available at Olive Garden. The deal also includes unlimited soft drinks for the pass-holder and those at their table - but no alcohol. The pass can be used as many times as the user wants throughout the seven-week period at Olive Garden locations across the U.S. The pastor tucks into another bowl at his local Olive Garden with the words: 'Hello, friend' The attention-grabbing promo has come at a tricky time for the chain. In July, the CEO and Chairman Clarence Otis stepped down as the Darden Restaurants company fights to fix its flagship Olive Garden chain following its contested sale of Red Lobster. The company, based in Orlando, Florida, has been pressured to turn around declining sales at Olive Garden and Red Lobster. Customers had begun turning away from those chains as they cut back on spending during the recession. Darden Restaurants Inc. completed the sale of Red Lobster to investment firm Golden Gate Capital in July. There has also been concern from diners over the calorie contents of those bottomless pasta bowls. Olive Garden boasts a significant amount of meals that have more calories, saturated fat and sodium than is recommended - and even more than a McDonald's value meal, according to a Drexel University-University of Pennsylvania study in January.

"McDonald's has closed down its franchises in Crimea, it was reported today. The U.S. fast-food giant has suspended work for ‘manufacturing reasons' in Simferopol, Sevastopol and Yalta. McDonald’s is the second international company to cease operations in Crimea this week, following the peninsula’s hasty annexation by Russia last month. Not lovin it: A man signals that the McDonald's restaurant in Simferopol is closed after McDonald's suspend all work on the Crimean peninsula for 'manufacturing reasons' The Crimean instability, and the recent invalidation of the referendum to reunite with Russia by the United Nation, means as it is unclear how the change may impact business in the Black Sea region. McDonald's, which operates three restaurants in Crimea, said it hoped to resume work as soon as possible, but offered to help relocate staff to Ukraine, even offering three months housing paid for by the company. This signals the multi-national fast-food chain does not expect its Crimean business to reopen in the near future. ‘The company has provided an opportunity to all employees ... to transfer to any other McDonald's restaurants in Ukraine preserving their positions, salaries and fees and paying to relocate employees and their families,’ it said in a statement. The closures follow Geneva-based Universal Postal Deutsche Post's announcement that it was no longer accepting letters bound for Crimea as delivery to the region was no longer guaranteed. UnHappy Meal: Despite saying the closure is only temporary, McDonald's offered staff working at their three Crimea franchises in Simferopol, Sevastopol and Yalta to relocate to Ukraine with three months paid housing for their families . McDone: A woman speaks on her phone inside a McDonald's restaurant displaying an announcement on the door informing clients that the restaurant is out of service . The news of the business exodus comes as British Foreign Secretary William Hague urged the EU to press on with tough sanctions against Russia over the developments in Crimea. Ahead of a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Athens, today, he said as Russian forces still remain on Ukraine's eastern border, the EU cannot be fooled to think the issue has been solved. Not relaxing: British Foreign Secretary William Hague . ‘We haven't seen real de-escalation by Russia and therefore Europe must not relax in preparing a third tier of sanctions and making sure we continue to have a strong and united response,’ he said. Hague was referring to tough trade and economic measures that the EU has threatened to take against Russia if it moves beyond Crimea into southern and eastern Ukraine. At the meeting in the Greek capital, Hague and his EU counterparts will discuss new ways the European Union can help Ukraine overcome its conflict with Russia, and discuss how the bloc can approach its neighbours to the east and south more effectively. They are not expected to make any decisions but could look at possible new sanctions against Russia and how the EU can help Kiev benefit from the EU's 11-billion-euro ($15 billion) aid package announced in recent weeks. Hague said it was too early for the EU's 28 governments to bolster sanctions against Moscow for now. ‘But they have to be ready because the situation remains very dangerous,’ he said. Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea has greatly strained its relations with Europe and is raising questions about the bloc's long-term policy towards Moscow and as well as about the EU's ability to support stability in the region.","McDonald's closing stores in Simferopol, Sevastopol and Yalta .

"Police and paramedics failed to notice that a 14-month-old boy was dead as they checked over his mother, who had smothered him a day before, after a car crash. Kayelisa Martin, 20, spoke calmly to the emergency services after the crash in Canton, Ohio - even carrying the lifeless body of her son as she went into a police station to fill in an accident report.

Martin spoke to paramedics and police officers while swaddling her son in a blanket - even visiting a police station with officers - but no one noticed that the young mother had smothered the boy a day earlier, the Canton Repository reported. Police and grandparents discovered Omoyele dead in a bed at the family home in Canton just after 7.30pm that day. Officers were called to the home because the child's mother was threatening suicide, police said. Around the same time, a family member went to the nearby Canton Fire Station No. 7 to report that the toddler was dead. When law enforcement arrived, however, Martin wasn't there. They tried to locate her, but soon received word that the  mother had killed herself. Omoyele Gonzalez was 14 months old when he was killed by his mother, and was found a day after he died . Officers were called to the home because the child's mother was threatening suicide, police said . Martin 'committed suicide by walking in front of a moving vehicle on I-77 at Milepost 115', near Akron-Canton Airport, police said. A Summit County sheriff's office statement said that she was struck when she stepped in front of a semi-trailer. Stark County Coroner P.S. Murthy said: 'After an extensive investigation by my office and detectives from the Canton Police Department, we believe that this baby died from probable smothering at the hands of his mother, Kayelisa Martin, during the early hours of August 7. 'We believe that, given what we saw at the scene, that the child had been dead 12 to 18 hours or more.' Captain Dave Davis, from Canton Police, said: 'Immediately after the child was killed, his mother was looking for ways to end her own life. We have evidence that she called several other family members trying to obtain a firearm and was asking people if it would be fatal to jump off a bridge.' var p = new anv_pl_def(); p.config = {}; p.config.width = 636; p.config.height = 400; p.loadVideoExpressV3('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|1000011|SPS'); .","Kayelisa Martin spoke to the police while holding baby son after car crash .

"One of the men charged is Tarik Hassane, 21, of Ladbroke Grove, west London . A gang of British terror suspects laughed in the dock yesterday as they were charged with plotting to kill policemen and soldiers in London drive-by shootings. Tarik Hassane, 21, Suhaib Majeed, 20, Nyall Hamlett, 24, and Momen Motasim, 21, appeared amid extraordinary security as they were charged with an Islamic State-inspired gun plot. It was alleged to have been formulated in response to a fatwa by a senior IS terrorist who called for followers to kill ‘disbelievers’ in their home countries. The gang is accused of swearing allegiance to IS and acquiring a handgun, silencer and ammunition in preparation for a mission to tour London on mopeds looking for targets. Prosecutor Mark Dawson told Westminster magistrates’ court yesterday: ‘It is a plot in essence, not fully formulated, to shoot to kill a police officer, police officers or soldiers on the streets of London in accordance with the fatwa that was issued.’ The gang is accused of scouting Shepherd’s Bush police station and White City Territorial Army barracks in a ‘hostile reconnaissance’ mission using Google Street View. They were said to have kept Instagram images of two Scotland Yard police officers and two community support officers. The group is also charged with amassing jihadist material, including videos of beheadings. It is the first alleged terrorist plot in Britain directly linked to the IS terrorists responsible for the murders of British hostages Alan Henning and David Haines. The young men, some of whom attended Westminster City School in London, were all born in Britain. Yesterday, when they appeared in court for the first time charged with intending to commit acts of terrorism, they were surrounded by 14 policemen and security officers, many wearing stab vests. Tarik Hassane, 21, known to friends as 'The Surgeon',  top of pic, has been charged with plotting to kill policemen and soldiers in London drive-by shootings along with Suhaib Majeed (bottom middle) The five men were brought to Westminster Magistrates Court this afternoon to the face charges . The group arrived at court under heavy police protection with a police helicopter overhead, while two vans and several marked cars encircled the building. One of the alleged plotters, medical student Hassane, who had been studying at the University of Medical Sciences and Technology in Sudan until recently, couldn’t stop giggling. Co-accused Majeed also smirked as details of the plot were read out. According to a lengthy charge sheet, the gang is said to have sworn an oath of allegiance to IS and downloaded the ‘fatwa of al-Adnani’ on mobile phones. IS official spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani al-Shami has called for retribution against the coalition of countries fighting the terrorists in Iraq and Syria. He instructed followers to kill by any means necessary civilians and soldiers in countries across Europe, Australia, Canada and the US. Police found copies of jihadi magazines that contained graphic images including the beheading of Steven Sotloff, an American journalist murdered by IS. Two police vans drove into the courthouse's back entrance after Scotland Yard announced the charges . The charges come after Metropolitan Police raids in the Ladbroke Grove area of central London last week . The men were said to have set up methods of secret communications and entered into covert discussions using code words for money, mopeds and firearms. Police recovered a Russian-made Baikal handgun, silencer and six rounds of ammunition. Yesterday the defendants were uncuffed before they entered the dock, where they spoke only to confirm their names, dates of birth and addresses during the brief hearing. A fifth man said to be the gang’s armourer also appeared. Nathan Cuffy, 25, is charged with the transfer of a converted Baikal handgun with a silencer and a magazine containing six rounds of ammunition. District Judge Emma Arbuthnot refused bail and all five were remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on October 27. Three other men arrested during Scotland Yard’s investigation earlier this month were released without charge. A 19-year-old woman was released on bail until next week pending further inquiries. Details of the charges emerged as Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, Britain’s counter-terrorism chief, warned that officers were grappling with ‘exceptionally high’ numbers of investigations.

"When Lady Diana Spencer asked up-and-coming fashion talent Elizabeth Emanuel to create a dress for her big day in 1981, the designer seemed set for stardom. But 32 years on from Princess Diana's wedding, Emanuel has turned to crowdfunding as she relaunches her fashion career with a brand new label. In a post on crowdfunding website, Crowdcube, the designer has asked investors to help her raise £750,000, with £28,000 raised within hours of Ms Emanuel's post on the site. Scroll down for video . New venture: Elizabeth Emanuel is hoping to raise £750,000 through crowdfunding website, Crowdcube . 'Recognised for dressing some of the world's most glamorous and influential women including Princess Diana's royal wedding dress, Elizabeth Emanuel is now embarking on a new venture.' reads the accompanying post. 'Art of Being will be the commercial vehicle bringing Elizabeth’s new and exciting [sic] design concepts to market through direct and indirect retailing, franchising and licencing agreements.' The designer is not the first A-lister to turn to Crowdcube with Easyjet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou and interior designer Kevin McCloud among those to launch new ventures with the help of the site. Ms Emanuel, who has also seen Elizabeth Taylor and Joan Collins - among many others - step out her designs, struggled to maintain the momentum built up by Princess Diana's wedding gown and lost the right to trade under her own name in the mid-1990s. Spectacular: With her husband David, Emanuel was responsible for creating Princess Diana's wedding gown . Big fan: TV presenter Charlie Webster is a big fan of Emanuel's new label and wore it twice last week . Since then, Ms Emanuel has battled back with a series of colourful collections, including 2013's Chocolate Collection, which proved a hit with celebrities and critics alike. Her new label, Art of Being, has already had some success, with TV presenter Charlie Webster stepping out in Emanuel-designed frocks on two separate occasions last week. Webster, 31, who is currently dating Downton Abbey star Allen Leech, 33, wore a black crystal embellished cocktail dress for the IWC gala in honour of the British Film Institute at Battersea Evolution last Tuesday. A second black cocktail dress, this time minus the crystals, was chosen for the premiere of The Imitation Game the following night. According to reports in the Telegraph, the designer's new output will start at £20,000 for a couture gown, while pieces from her ready-to-wear collection will cost a minimum of £1,500.","Elizabeth Emanuel is the designer behind Princess Diana's wedding dress .

"While all attention at Westminster was focused on whether to allow gay marriage, this Coalition Government did something furtive – something that is not only much less liberal, but coldly terrifying. Under the cover of the furore, it quietly disinterred the corpse of its ‘Secret Justice’ Bill. This Bill creates extraordinary new legal powers to keep official dealings hidden from us. It changes all the comforting certainties about the rule of law in Britain. Most of us have some kind of grasp of what is officially called the Justice and Security Bill. Scroll down for video . Focus: While the attention was on MPs voting on gay marriage in the House of Commons the Government revived work on the 'Secret Justice Bill' But it can be hard to imagine what it would actually mean  in practice. The Government wants us to think its scope is limited to rare and arcane disputes, perhaps born of foreign battlefields. Or ones that sound as if they belong in spy novels, involving CIA ‘black ops’ and ‘dark jails’. But if it becomes law, the effects will be felt much closer to home. The shocking outcome of the recent Hillsborough Inquiry, bringing justice at last to 97 families? If similar circumstances were to arise again, it is likely that justice would never be delivered: if the families tried to sue, alleging a bungled police operation and a subsequent cover-up, the Bill would give the authorities the ability to keep the truth concealed. Decider: Ulster Democratic Unionist Ian Paisley Jnr cast the critical vote on the revised draft of the Bill . A case brought against the Ministry of Defence by families of soldiers killed in a foreign deployment, alleging their loved ones’ equipment was defective? This is not mere hypothesis. Many argue now that the British death toll in Afghanistan has been higher than it should have been because some of our military vehicles were too vulnerable to roadside bombs. With this law enshrined, the Government could insist on a closed, secret hearing. There, it could present evidence denying such claims. No one could challenge it, because no one directly affected by the case would ever know what it was. Or take the very real, current scandal of the women green activists who unknowingly entered sexual relationships with undercover police officers. Those defending such a case could be entitled to a secret hearing, at which they could claim that such tactics were entirely justified, on the basis that the women posed some kind of threat to national security. This is the reality of a society regulated by secret justice:  a legal system weighted irredeemably in favour of those in power. The legislation had previously been watered down considerably, and wisely, by the House of Lords. Now, it is not just as bad as it was when introduced last year. It’s even worse. Under the resuscitated Bill, matters . involving State security will usually be heard at secret ‘closed . material procedure’ hearings. They will be attended only by . security-vetted ‘special advocates’. Those involved in cases against . official bodies will be permanently unable to know about the evidence . deployed against them. The . new revised draft, the product of the final session of the Bill’s . committee stage, was forced through by a majority of one. The Ulster . Democratic Unionist Ian Paisley Jnr cast the critical vote. This . took place at precisely the same time as the same-sex marriage debate . was happening in the main Commons chamber, which is why all this went . virtually unnoticed. Justice: Under the new powers information revealed by the recent Hillsborough inquiry could have remained concealed by the authorities . The consequences are draconian. The Government’s actions, prompted by intense lobbying from MI5 and MI6 security chiefs, mean there is now less than three weeks to stop the enactment of a ruthless measure that amounts to a charter for cover-ups. A real recent example of a case that will be affected is that of Abdelhakim Belhadj. He is the Libyan opposition leader abducted with his family from Bangkok with the help of British intelligence, then  tortured by Gaddafi’s brutal regime for years. Like other victims of ‘extraordinary rendition’, Mr Belhadj,  who has never been alleged to have committed a single hostile act against Britain, its citizens or its allies, is suing the UK Government. But the official evidence of what was done in our name will be deemed far too ‘sensitive’ to be aired in open court. Once the Bill becomes law, his chances of success are remote. And the prospects for enforcing the merest whiff of accountability on the agencies responsible for torture cases, and, indeed, a vast range of official activity from national security to the country’s ‘economic wellbeing’, will be just as distant. Safeguards: Conservative backbencher David Davies said it was 'appalling' that the Government reneged on its promise to allow full judicial discretion . Previously, the Lords had passed two crucial safeguards to stop this. The first said judges could grant the Government a secret hearing only if other alternatives had already been considered, like, for example, asking permission from the judge in a case to withhold sensitive evidence altogether, under the longstanding system of ‘public interest immunity’. The second Lords safeguard was more fundamental. It stated that judges could allow a secret hearing only after balancing the Government’s demand for one against the historic legal principle that justice must always be open. Last week, with the passage of Amendment 55, moved by the junior Justice Minister James Brokenshire, both these safeguards were swept away. ‘In practice, it will now be very difficult for a judge to resist a closed hearing,’ one legal analyst said yesterday. Under this Bill, it is now possible a prisoner in a British jail who tried to challenge his detention in the courts would remain incarcerated without hearing the evidence against him. The battle is not over. Pending is a High Court action by The Mail on Sunday which seeks to make public a secret judgment issued in an Afghan alleged torture case two years ago, which resulted from an earlier form of secret hearing, now deemed illegal by the Supreme Court. As this newspaper has pointed out, the Bill will inevitably lead to a body of secret law and secret legal precedents. Our case also asks the court to issue guidelines on how such secret judgments should be reviewed, and whenever possible, published. Meanwhile both Labour and several influential Tories are determined to try to reinstate the Lords’ safeguards when the Bill returns to the full House of Commons later this month. David Davis, the leading Conservative backbencher, said: ‘It is appalling that the Government has reneged on its promise to allow full judicial discretion as enacted by the Lords.’ Andrew Tyrie, the Tory who campaigned for years against torture and rendition, says: ‘Not only must all of the Lords’ amendments remain in the Bill, they need to be underpinned by further improvements.’ Mr Davis added: ‘What the Government did last week is a massive dilution of the protections put in place by the Lords. I can only hope they will summon up the courage to reinstate them.’ It is a hope anyone with even the vaguest interest in open justice would surely share.","Vote on Bill took place at same time as gay marriage vote .

"Under fire: The figures will put even more pressure on NHS Chief Executive Sir David Nicholson in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire scandal . The NHS spent £15million in three years on gagging whistleblowers, the Mail can reveal today. The shocking figures pile the pressure on NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson, who has clung to his £270,000 role despite presiding over the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal that cost the lives of 1,200 patients. In just three years there were 598 ‘special severance payments’, almost all of which carried draconian confidentiality clauses aimed at silencing whistleblowers. They cost the taxpayer £14.7million, the equivalent of almost 750 nurses’ salaries. Yet only last week, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned the NHS against silencing internal dissent. He said for too long there had been a culture of celebrating success in the NHS, but ‘not being honest about failure’. He added: ‘We must have a culture where people are not afraid to speak out.’ Last night Steve Barclay, the Tory MP who uncovered the figures, demanded that Sir David be recalled to give evidence to the influential Commons public accounts committee to justify the £14.7million bill. The publication of the figures for the three years up until 2011 comes after a two-year battle by Mr Barclay, who is a member of the public accounts committee. The Department of Health and the Treasury, which are notified of the cost of the agreements by the relevant NHS bodies, had steadfastly refused to publish the costs. The figures were finally released after Mr Barclay tabled a series of parliamentary questions. On three occasions, Mr Barclay raised concerns with Sir David, a former card-carrying Communist, about why whistleblowers were not being excluded from the confidentiality clauses. Each time he was assured action had been taken. On the last occasion, at the public accounts committee meeting in September last year, Sir David said: ‘I thought we had done it.’ Mr Barclay, MP for North East Cambridgeshire, has written to committee chairman Margaret Hodge, demanding that Sir David is recalled to discuss the use of gagging clauses across the NHS. Silenced: The 'special severance payments' would stop whistleblowers speaking out if they saw poor treatment of patients such as that which occurred in Mid Staffordshire . Warning: Just last week health secretary Jeremy Hunt warned the NHS against silencing internal dissent . Headlines: From Monday's Mail . He told the Daily Mail: ‘There is a clear value-for-money implication here, both in ensuring the best possible outcomes in the health service, and the cost of the payments. 'I am requesting the committee recalls Sir David Nicholson to examine the use of gagging clauses across the NHS. ‘These gagging clauses are having a chilling effect on whistleblowers. It is shocking that over a three-year period an estimated 90 per cent of the 598 compromise agreements entered into by the NHS included gagging clauses. Whistleblowers: Both Gary Walker, left, and David Bowles, right, were hounded out of their jobs for raising concerns with Sir David Nicholson . ‘It means that hundreds of potential whistleblowers may have been prevented from speaking out for fear of legal action, at a total cost to the taxpayer of almost £15million. Sacked: Heart surgeon Raj Mattu lost his job after speaking out about his hospital . ‘It begs the question: Were NHS officials genuinely in the dark about the use of gagging clauses – in which case why were executives like Sir David Nicholson not aware it was going on? – or were they actually the ones turning off the lights when the gag went on? ‘It is glaringly obvious that many NHS employees feel they are being silenced by non-disclosure clauses in their contracts. ‘It is now clear that a whistleblower who has reported concerns internally, but has not seen improvements take place, is induced, with taxpayers’ money, to agree to sign away their rights to not take them any further.’ Some of the highest ‘special severance payouts’ were at Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which paid £224,000 in 2011. South Staffordshire and Shropshire Health Care Trust, which borders Mid Staffordshire, made payments of £90,000, £190,000 and £35,000 in 2010/11. A Department of Health spokesman said the number of confidentiality clause payouts was falling sharply and that in 2011/12, there were just 20 cases in NHS Trusts at a cost of just over £500,000. However, this figure did not include costs for the 105 Foundation Trusts, which in 2010/11 racked up a bill of £2.5million on gagging clauses.","The figures pile more pressure on NHS boss Sir David Nicholson .

"When Austin Wayne Underwood proposed to his girlfriend Jessica Smith, it marked a celebratory milestone for the Texas couple, who both have Down syndrome.

But their friendship soon developed into something stronger and the couple, now in their mid-30s, are busily planning their wedding. Scroll down for video . Sweethearts: Austin and Jessica are fitted for boots as they prepare for their wedding . The couple's romance is a cause of celebration for their families, who had fought to give Austin and Jessica a regular childhood at a time when many people who have their condition were kept separate. Austin's mother, Jan Underwood, had to battle the Fort Worth school system to send him to the regular high school, and even found a New Mexico college that takes in Down students, so her son could experience student life. 'People usually hide people with . disabilities. We always treated him as a little boy first and his . disability second. He has a normal life,' Mrs Underwood told Fort Worth Texas Magazine. Her determination that Austin would lead a normal life has paid off, with him set to marry his fiancée, Jessica, at a Western-themed wedding at a Dallas vineyard.

"A woman police chief has come under fire for seeming to defend a colleague who described a shooting victim’s fiancee as ‘some bit of skirt’. Colette Paul, Bedfordshire’s chief constable, said the comment – made by an investigation during a fly-on-the-wall TV documentary about Luton Police Station – was ‘forgivable’. The first episode follows the arrest and questioning of a suspect in the shooting of accountant Atif Ali. Scroll down for video . Detective Constable Gary Hales is filmed referring to the fiancee of shotgun shooting victim Atif Ali as ‘some bit of skirt’ during an episode of 24 Hours in Police Custody . The 20-part Channel 4 fly-on-the-wall series shows life behind the scenes at Bedfordshire Police, run by Chief Constable Colette Paul and Police Commissioner Olly Martins . Mr Ali, who was blasted with a sawn-off shotgun by a hitman hired by a love rival, said the comments made him feel 'sick' and that they were 'disrespectful' Mr Ali, who was innocent of any wrongdoing, was blasted with a sawn-off shotgun by a hitman hired by a love rival. In the Channel 4 programme, Detective Constable Gary Hales is shown referring to Mr Ali’s then fiancee as ‘some bit of skirt’. He is later filmed saying to colleagues: ‘What’s this girl like then? Is she a bit of a looker? Why would you want to do 15 years in prison?’ Mrs Paul admitted ‘wincing’ when she watched the footage, but insisted: ‘It’s forgivable but not what I would want someone to say. ‘I made it clear when I was asked about some of the language used by officers and staff at the advanced press screening that there are things shown in the series which I do not enjoy seeing. Swearing and off-hand comments about others in the office environment is not what I want to see from my staff. But I do accept that the round-the-clock filming over six weeks in a tough and tiring environment was always going to produce a few moments where officers would express their frustrations and it would make me wince – they are only human.' Mr Ali, who needed surgery after being shot in the leg, told the Mail he felt ‘sick’ at the comments. He added: ‘If this is true, then I don’t accept it is banter. It is highly disrespectful from someone who is supposed to uphold the highest morals and ethics.’ Detective Constable Martin Hart has been compared to the Office's David Brent for his cringeworthy role in the documentary series, including a moment where he shows a colleague pictures of cheese sauce on a burger that he ate . Mr Hales is also shown squeezing a squeaking rubber chicken when the suspect is charged, saying: ‘It gets squeezed when we get a good result.’ Mrs Paul confirmed that she had spoken to DC Hales about his insensitive remark. She said he had tole her there was no intention to cause offence to Mr Ali or his fiancee, merely a desire to gather evidence. At the same press conference when Mrs Paul made her comments, it emerged some officers had refused to appear in the programme because they were paying child maintenance and did not want ex-partners to know they had been promoted. The first episode also shows a female desk sergeant saying she needs to get home ‘before I punch somebody’, while booking in a man who smashed a door at his mother’s home because his games console was broken. Another officer involved in Mr Ali’s case, Detective Constable Martin Hart, has been compared to The Office’s hapless David Brent following his appearance on the documentary. He talks incessantly about a recent holiday to Las Vegas and shows a bored-looking colleague pictures of some cheese sauce he had on a burger. The 20-part series, 24 Hours in Police Custody, starts at 9pm tonight. It was filmed in April and May by The Garden Productions, which was behind Channel 4’s 24 Hours in A&E. Future episodes will cover issues such as child sex abuse, domestic violence and drugs. The force waived any control over content except in two cases because of ‘family and legal reasons’. Last week it emerged Bedfordshire’s deputy police and crime commissioner, Tafheen Sharif, 32, was forced to step down after she attempted to gag the court in Mr Ali’s case. She tried to prevent his ex-fiancee – a distant cousin of hers – being named in coverage.","Detective Constable Martin Gale was caught on camera making the remark .

"CCTV footage at the Costcutter store in Essex captured the would-be thief who was wearing the Rod Stewart style mask . A shop worker was left terrified after a man wearing a Rod Stewart mask pulled a gun out on her during a daylight robbery – but ended up leaving empty handed after botching the raid. Trina Arthur, 31, was working alone in the Costcutter store when the man walked in wearing a mask in likeness to the famous blonde rocker. The mother-of-two, who was cashing up behind the counter when she felt someone lean over and ruffle her hair, looked up to find the man pointing a handgun at her. He then attempted to lean over the counter and grab cash from the till but was spooked when Miss Arthur screamed and hit the panic button. The would-be thief ended up fleeing empty handed and police believe he may have run off towards a nearby alleyway in Maldon, Essex. A police helicopter, armed officers and dog units were scrambled to the scene in a bid to find the masked man following the incident on March 27. Miss Arthur, who has worked at the Costcutter store for three years, said: ‘I initially thought it was one of the regular customers having a joke when I looked up and saw the Rod Stewart mask. ‘Then I saw he had a gun and I just started screaming. ‘As soon as he saw me hit the panic button, he ran out of the shop.’ The terrifying incident has left the shop worker on edge. She said: ‘I am petrified now. I have not been able to sleep. I keep seeing him with the gun. It felt like forever until the police arrived - I have never been so scared. ‘It’s not something that you think will ever happen to you.’ Trina Arthur, 31, was working alone in the Costcutter store when the man walked in wearing a mask in the likeness of rocker Rod Stewart, pictured . The would-be thief, pictured, pointed a handgun at shop worker Miss Arthur but ended up fleeing empty handed after she pressed the panic alarm . The shop’s owner Mustafa Demirci, 34, said: ‘Luckily no-one was hurt and he did not get any money. ‘As soon as Trina called me, I knew it was serious from the tone of her voice but I never expected it to be an armed robbery.’ The store was able to provide police with CCTV of the incident which shows the man in his bizarre mask. Essex Police said the suspect was around 5ft 8ins tall, of medium build and was wearing a grey and white top and black coat. A police helicopter, armed officers and dog units were scrambled to the scene in a bid to find the masked man following the incident on March 27 . He was also wearing work-style trousers with reflective stripes on them during the raid which occurred at around 9.45am. Officers today arrested a 51 year-old man from Maldon, Essex, in connection with the attempted armed robbery. He was questioned by police before being released on bail until May 19 pending further enquiries.

"Four men have been jailed for a Match.com dating scam which saw vulnerable single women duped out of £220,000. Monty Emu, Emmanuel Oko, Chukwuka Ugwu and Adewunmi Nusi were sentenced at Winchester Crown Court today after using fake profiles to con women out of their life savings. They posed as middle-aged men under the names James Richards and Melvyn Binion to develop a relationship and then start asking for cash. Scroll down for video . Monty Emu (left) and Emmanuel Oko (right) were  handed prison sentences at Winchester Crown Court today . Chukwuka Ugwu (left) and Adewunmi Nusi (right) were also sent to jail after the scam, which duped 14 women . A total of 14 women fell for the scam after they were fed gushing messages that claimed the father of the man – ‘a widower’ – had died and left £1.5million in his will. But the bachelor said he would need £700 to go to India to access the money, funded by the victims, and then would say he had hit problems on the trip and beg for more money to release inheritance. The cash was paid into bank accounts and transferred to others before it was withdrawn around Portsmouth, Hampshire. Divorcee Suzanne Hardman, 56, lost a staggering £174,000 after being pursued by a man she believed to be 48-year-old Mr Richards. Mrs Hardman, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, said in a victim impact statement read to the court the ordeal made her feel 'sick to her stomach', robbed her of all self-respect and left her unable to eat or sleep. Suzanne Hardman, who was conned out of £174,000 after she was duped on the dating website . The court heard the scam 'constantly plays' on her mind and she has had to take time off work through stress. The statement said: ‘I felt very vulnerable, sick to my stomach and ashamed. ‘I felt no one could ever get to me in this way and have lost self-respect because of it. ‘I feel that it is my fault. I was the one caught up in this and feel it was my own undoing. ‘Looking back I ask myself why I did not realise what was going on and warn others about the dangers of online dating. ‘I have tried to put the incident to the back of my mind but cannot. ‘One of the worst things is that through this I have never seen or heard this “James”.’ Another victim was Michelle Sparham, who gave away money saved to help her son through university, today told the packed court her life was wrecked after she was approached by Mr Binion. She described herself becoming a 'selective mute' who struggles to talk to adults and even refused to go into hospital after being diagnosed with pleurisy and pneumonia last October. She said she tried to throw herself into work, clocking up 14 hour days in a bid to prove herself. Fighting back tears in the witness box today, Mrs Sparham said: ‘I no longer trust any adults, male or female. ‘I just do not believe what they tell me and do not pick out the positive or good people are telling me. Suzanne Hardman said the ordeal made her feel 'sick to her stomach' and robbed her of all her self-respect . The picture of 'James Richards' on the fake profile, which shows a man with hazel eyes and dark hair . ‘Before this incident I was a trusting person and this organisation has affected my daily life. ‘Now I tend not to trust anyone and this can make my life very confusing and hard work.’ She added: ‘For about 12 years I was a marathon runner and weighed about 10 and a half stone but since this I have gained weight. ‘Since this deceit against me I do not believe I deserve anything good and feel the need to constantly punish myself.’ Sylvia Choi, another of the group’s duped women, said she ‘hit rock bottom’, did not want to leave the house, suffered nightmares and was too scared to answer the phone. One message sent to the women from the fake profile read: ‘You make me feel important, you make me feel safe and wanted, something I have not felt for a very long time. The group targeted the women through dating site Match.com were they developed a relationship before asking for cash . ‘I knew our friendship would grow from the first time we spoke but neither one of us could have begun to imagine the love thundering into our hearts that only we can understand. ‘You are my soulmate, my best friend, my life, my inspiration - my everything.’ Sentencing at Winchester Crown Court today, Judge Susan Evans said the 'large scale' scam had an enormous effect on the 'lonely and emotionally vulnerable' victims. She said: ‘This was a sophisticated conspiracy to defraud. It played upon the trusting, the lonely and the emotionally vulnerable. ‘The amount of planning involved in this scam was substantial and would have required a number of people. ‘Fake profiles had to be set up - they had to be convincing, they had to be detailed, listing things like their religion and what they were looking for in a partner. ‘A fake passport was set up for James Richards and legal looking documents were created. ‘Someone had to write all those emails - some were repeats but some had to be “fact specific”, and a number of people must also have been involved in phone calls with the victims. This email reveals how the women were bombarded with messages where 'James' declared his love for them but also mentioned problems that would be solved by their cash . A fake passport for 'James Richards' - the name used to swindle cash from 14 vulnerable women . ‘The characters had to be played by individual people on the telephone and they had to keep track of the plot so the calls made sense to the victim and were believable. ‘They were orchestrated, detailed and plainly rehearsed to perfection. ‘This was a large scale fraud and a very unpleasant one. ‘The distressed victims speak of depression, sleepless nights, loss of confidence, an inability to trust others and feelings of humiliation, embarrassment and shame. ‘Some of those targeted were utterly taken in. Adewunmu Nusi who was today sentenced to 18-months in prison . ‘That is unsurprising. They believed themselves to be in a relationship with these people and the hurt and distress you caused them was enormous. ‘As many of them say, it is not even about the money, it is about the emotional hurt that you caused them. ‘Some of them lost substantial amounts of money they could ill afford to lose. ‘For Mrs Hardman it was her life savings and for another it was the money she saved for her son to go to university.’ Detective Constable Darrin Carey, from Hampshire Police, said the 'devious' group constructed a 'web of lies' to exploit the emotionally vulnerable. DC Carey added the case should act as a warning to con artists that they will be caught, and thanked victims for their 'courage' in reporting their 'distressing' ordeals. The Crown Prosecution Service has applied for all assets from the crimes to be confiscated. Oko, 29, from Southsea, Hampshire was given eight years in prison for the fraud charge and four years for money laundering, to be served concurrently. Emu, 28, from Southsea, Hampshire, was handed three years and six months, and Ugwu, 28, from Portsmouth, Hampshire, was sentenced to 46 weeks in prison. They attended the University of Portsmouth at the time of the scam. Fashion designer Nusi, 37, from Hermitage in Berkshire, who has previous convictions for alcohol and driving offences, received an 18 month jail term. Two others - Brooke Boston, 29, of Southsea, Hampshire, was cleared of charges of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering and Eberechi Ekpo, 26, also of Southsea was also cleared of money laundering and fraud by false representation part way through the trial.","Four men sentenced to 13 years in prison at Winchester Crown Court .

"A senior Russian diplomat has advised U.S. policymakers to calm down and 'practice yoga' following their response to the annexation of Crimea. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov accused the U.S. of 'tantrums, weeping and hysteria' following last month's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. The West has imposed sanctions on officials and businessmen believed to be close to President Vladimir Putin in response to the move. A senior Russian diplomat has told U.S. policymakers to calm down following their response to the annexation of Crimea. Pictured are Russian soldiers unloading the new modified Russian T-72 tanks from railway platforms in the village of Gvardeyskoe, near Simferopol, Crimea . The West has imposed sanctions on officials and businessmen believed to be close to President Vladimir Putin in response to the move . While many of those blacklisted have mocked the sanctions, wearing them as a badge of honour, they have also rankled Moscow, with officials warning the West was only doing damage to itself. Ryabkov has now told the Interfax news agency: 'What can one advise our U.S. colleagues to do? Spend more time in the open, practice yoga, stick to food-combining diets, maybe watch some comedy sketch shows on TV. 'This would be better than winding oneself up and winding up others, knowing that the ship has already sailed ... Tantrums, weeping and hysteria won't help.' His remarks followed disclosure by U.S. officials that Washington had added space agency NASA to a list of U.S. entities banned from contacting Russian government envoys, a largely symbolic gesture to raise pressure on Russia. Ryabkov said such a freeze in . bilateral contacts had caused 'ridiculous situations' when meetings . between meteorologists from both countries had to be cancelled. 'Oh well, that's the Americans' choice,' he said.

'One can see that the U.S. leadership is ""fixated"", and they fail to accept the situation which has been shaped largely by the line (pursued) by the United States and their European allies to bring anti-Russian forces into power in Ukraine.' A referendum held in Crimea last month after Russian troops seized control of the Russian-majority region overwhelmingly backed union with Russia, but was denounced by Washington and the European Union as a sham amounting to a land grab. The vote opened the way for annexation within a week. Russia intervened in Crimea after the toppling of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich following deadly clashes between riot police and protesters trying to overturn his decision to spurn a trade and cooperation deal with the EU in favour of cultivating closer relations with old Soviet master Moscow. Russia accused the West of orchestrating the 'coup' against Yanukovich, and some analysts say the Crimea annexation was Putin's punishment of the West for ignoring Moscow's interest in the former Soviet republic that it considers to be its backyard. The Kremlin has also demanded NATO explain its activities in eastern Europe, not far from old Soviet borders, after the Western military alliance pledged to improve defences for its eastern members following Russia's takeover of Crimea.","Russian Deputy Foreign Minister accuses U.S. of 'hysteria' over Crimea .

"Rather than simply - and cheaply - cleaning a dirty roundabout warning sign, a bumbling council instead decided to install a brand new sign just two foot in front of the old one. Council contractors then left the dirty old sign on Rundle Road, Sheffield in place. The staggering waste of taxpayer money has left residents of Sheffield City Council seeing red as well as double, with one man accusing the council of ‘squandering money’. Seeing double: Sheffield Council install a brand new roundabout sign, directly in front of the old one . ‘Typical of Sheffield City Council. Experts at squandering money. Our money!’ Tweeted furious resident Pete Flynn. Another resident, Mark Hope, said the council could ‘add it to the list of failures and the millions they waste.' The furore has forced Sheffield Council to explain itself. The council is blaming ‘cutbacks’ for the double up, with Councillor Jack Scott claiming ‘Because of massive cuts to Sheffield by the coalition, we need to cut back. Waste of money: Furious residents want to know why the council didn't just clean the old sign . ‘We will remove the old sign and pole and use the value of the metal to reduce the cost of the new sign. This change is a small one-off expense for an ongoing saving, so it's worth doing. 'There’s no point having lights on in the middle of the night when nobody is there, just wasting electricity.' But Mr Flynn isn't convinced, claiming that the council's sums don't add up. 'So do you buy a new car when it gets dirty to save money? I can't wait to vote these geniuses out,' he said.","Sheffield City Council decided the existing roundabout sign was too dirty and difficult to read .

"When Fleur East took to the stage in the first live X Factor show on Saturday, it wasn't just her performance that impressed. She also drew admiration for her defined abs, with judge Mel B complimenting the singer for her toned muscles during her appraisal. So what's the secret to Fleur's enviable figure? Abs factor: Fleur revealed her toned tummy as she performed on on the first live show . The 26-year-old from East London told Women's Health that there are no quick fixes - it's all down to exercising regularly and eating well. She said: 'I normally hit the gym five times a week. I tend to do half an hour of cardio – on the treadmill or a spin class – then head for the weights. I do a lot of core work, obviously!' Core work refers to exercises to strengthen the core muscles around the abdomen. These act like a corset, pulling the stomach in and improving posture. Exercises Fleur said she does to strengthen her core include the plank - which she boosts she can hold for two minutes. Works out: The singer does exercises like the plank and mountain climbers to get her flat stomach . Appreciation: The judges were impressed with Fleur's performance as well as her figure . Beginners should start by trying to hold the position for 30 seconds. It involves lying face down on the floor, positioning your arms under your shoulders, and then lifting your body up so you're balanced on your toes and forearms. The stomach should be held it and beginners may be feel wobbly - it's certainly a move that's harder than it looks. Variations include doing the plank side on, balancing on one forearm and the outside of the foot. Personal trainer and author of the Fat Burn Revolution Julia Buckley told MailOnline that Fleur is wise to do the plank for a toned tummy. She said: 'The plank is one of the best exercises for tightening the tummy because it works the whole midsection of your body, including the deep abdominal muscles. It is also great for improving posture and balance and will build core strength to help you perform better many other exercises.' Now Fleur is strong enough to hold the position for two minutes, Julia recommends she takes it further by adding some movement. Keeps fit: Fleur said she's always loved exercising and is making the most of the gym in The X Factor house . Healthy eater: The singer snacks on fruit and nuts when rehearsing . She explains: 'I'm a big fan of adding movement to planks once you're able to hold the position with good form, adding motion does much more to strengthen and shape the abdominal area than simply staying in the pose for ever longer periods of time, so I get clients to raise alternate arms and legs or doing things like palm-to-elbow planks where then alternate between having their hands and elbows on the mat.' Other moves Fleur does to get her toned stomach include mountain climbers and press-ups. Speaking of the latter, she told the magazine: 'Yes, they're an upper body move but your core's engaged all the way through.' Julia agrees. She said: 'Press ups are an awesome all-body move, again you're bracing the core and engaging the abdominal muscles to maintain a straight position, which is great for shredding the belly and at the same time you're sculpting the chest and arms.' Mountain climbers involves bending down on the floor with the hands down and arms straight and then moving your legs in a running motion bringing alternative knees up to the chest and straightening the leg again. 'Mountain climbers are fantastic exercise, offering a total body workout in single “do anywhere” move. The core is activated to keep the body in position while you power the legs out behind you. They are hardcore, but if you want to burn body fat these will definitely get you ignited!' Julia said. Fleur isn't afraid to lift weights or use exercise machines at the gym. Her figure proves doing so achieves a slim, muscular figure - not one of a bulky body builder which some women fear they will get if they lift weights. The X Factor finalist, who is mentored by Simon Cowell, said she uses the leg press machine and does squats with a barbell. Julia said this is a great move: 'Squats are among the best exercises you can do to firm up and sculpt the legs and bum and they also work the core and back muscles. Using a loaded barbell for these is an excellent idea once you've cracked the right technique because they fire up some large muscles which makes them great for fat burning - and no one wants their ripped abs hiding under a layer of flab.' For Fleur, exercise is a pleasure and not a chore. She said: 'I've always loved working out. When I was little my dad used to make me and my sister do 10 press-ups every day, before we brushed our teeth in the morning. It was like a boot camp! Then I did a lot of athletics at school, and was a dancer.' She added that she eats healthily rather than following a strict diet. She'll opt for brown bread and rice other white varieties because they have a lower Glycemic Index and avoids fizzy drinks and sweets. For a snack to keep her energy up when rehearsing, she favours fresh fruit and mixed nuts. She admitted sticking to her rule of 'everything in moderation' can be difficult now she's currently outside her usual routine. 'There's a lot of temptation in the X Factor house,' she said. 'All the girls have a sweet tooth – they love sweets and chocolate. So I'm trying to convert people!' But she revealed the finalists are all being encouraged to take care of themselves thanks to an in-house chef who cooks healthy meals and a gym within their plush shared mansion. After an understated start to the competition - where she fared to stand out hugely from the crowd in the audition and boot camp stages - Fleur impressed Cowell at the judges' houses stage seeing her through to the live shows. After her performance on Saturday, she's now tipped to go far, so we'll be seeing a lot more of those abs.","X Factor finalist has enviable abs .

"California has become the first state in the US to pass a law designed to define when 'yes means yes' to prevent sexual assaults. The bill was signed by California Governor Jerry Brown yesterday and will adopt requirements for colleges to follow when investigating sexual assault reports. The legislation says silence or lack of resistance do not constitute consent, and that someone who is drunk, drugged, unconscious or asleep cannot grant consent. The bill designed to define when 'yes means yes' to prevent sexual assaults was signed by California Governor Jerry Brown (pictured) yesterday . States and universities across the US are under pressure to change how they deal with sexual assault reports. Campus sexual assault victims and women's advocacy groups delivered petitions to Gov Brown's office a fortnight ago urging him to sign the bill. Senator Kevin de Leon, who represents Los Angeles, said the legislation will change how college campuses in California look in to sexual assaults. Rather than using the refrain 'no means no,' the definition of consent under the bill requires 'an affirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity.' He said: 'With one in five women on college campuses experiencing sexual assault, it is high time the conversation regarding sexual assault be shifted to one of prevention, justice, and healing.' Lawmakers say consent can be nonverbal, and universities with similar policies have outlined examples as a nod of the head or moving in closer to the person. Advocates for victims of sexual assault supported the change as one that will provide consistency across campuses and challenge the notion that victims must have resisted assault to have valid complaints. The bill requires training for faculty reviewing complaints so victims are not asked inappropriate questions when filing complaints. The bill also requires access to counselling, health care services and other resources. Speaking out: Handmade signs decrying rape decorate tents set at an evening to raise awareness of sexual assault at Occidental College in Los Angeles, which is one of the colleges affected by the bill . When lawmakers were considering the bill, critics said it was overreaching and could put universities in murky legal waters. Some Republicans in the Assembly questioned whether statewide legislation was an appropriate venue to define sexual consent between two people. There was no opposition from Republicans in the state Senate. Gordon Finley, an adviser to the National Coalition for Men, wrote an editorial asking Gov Brown not to sign the bill. He argued that 'this campus rape crusade bill' presumed the guilt of the accused. The bill, called SB967, applies to all California post-secondary schools, public and private, that receive state money for student financial aid. The California State University and University of California systems are backing the legislation after adopting similar consent standards this year. University of California President Janet Napolitano recently announced the system will voluntarily establish an independent advocate to support sexual assault victims on every campus.","California is the first state to pass a law that aims to prevent sexual assaults .

"A new artwork by elusive street artist Banksy based on a famous painting from 1665 has been spotted on a wall in his home town. The piece - which is a parody of Girl with a Pearl Earring by Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer - incorporates a burglar alarm as the earring. Banksy entitled the work Girl with a Pierced Eardrum, and painted it on a building near Bristol's docks before posting it on his website. The artist made a joke about a burger van opposite the painting, with the caption ‘Gallery café open Monday to Sunday 8am to 2pm’. The original painting inspired a historical novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier in 1999, and a 2003 film starring Scarlett Johansson. The last Banksy work seen in Bristol was Mobile Lovers - stencilled outside a youth club, and sold to a collector for £403,000 in August. And the most recent Banksy art anywhere was Art Buff, seen in Folkestone, Kent, on September 28. It has since been vandalised twice. What’s that doing ear?

"A nameless soldier who became an emblem of the bravery and suffering of British soldiers sent to die in the brutal Battle of the Somme may finally have been identified. The young man, who was captured on film carrying the body of a wounded comrade on his soldiers, featured in a 1916 film which showed thousands the true horrors of the First World War for the first time. He was widely suspected to have died during the war, but a striking photograph has emerged of an army private - Frederick Darkes - who could have been the mysterious figure, and in fact lived until the 1960s. Scroll down for video . Suffering: The 1916 film, The Battle of the Somme, showed many the horrors of war for the first time . Similarities: The two images, digitally combined above, show a similarity between the soldier from the film (left) and a later photograph of Private Frederick Darkes - whose surviving family believe that he was the man from the footage . The 77-minute footage - released to the . public under the title The Battle of the Somme - showed shocking images . of the front lines, including the mud-splattered trenches and images of . wounded men. The film was an unprecedented success. Around 20million people are thought to have seen it within six weeks of its release, and although many found the vivid images of war disturbing, seeing British soldiers in action provided a massive boost in support for the war. However, the man featured bearing his fellow soldier on his back wore no identifying . information - and the producers of the film did not keep any records of . who appeared in it. The only note accompanying the scene says that the . wounded man died half an hour after the footage was taken. But now the mystery could have been solved after claims emerged that the son of a stretcher bearer who served in the battle says that he recognises his father from the footage. Potential match: This photograph shows Private Darkes with his wife after the war, and bears a resemblance to the figure in the 1916 footage . Generations: Raymond Darkes (right) poses with a photograph of his parents alongside his son Paul (left) War relics: Pictured are a war medal and notebook which belonged to Private Darkes . According to 83-year-old Raymond . Darkes, the mysterious and heroic figure is in fact Private Frederick . Darkes, a member of the 11th Battalion Royal Warwickshire Regiment. A . comparison between images from the footage and a later photograph of . Private Darkes are strikingly similar - and now the Darkes family are . seeking help from experts at the Imperial War Museum to see whether the . identity can be confirmed after 98 years. Paul Darkes, Private Darkes's grandson, said: 'We have papers to prove that granddad was in France, and we can prove he got discharged in 1917, after he lost the use of in one arm. 'My dad always says ""I know my own father"" and he is happy with that, but to have it confirmed would be marvellous for him. 'The War Office say that his regiment was in that area at the time - I believe there are face recognition techniques that are available today. As the centenary of the First World War approaches, Private Darkes is not the possible match for the nameless soldier. Just weeks ago it was suggested that Tom Wright, a stretcher bearer in the Royal Army Medical Corps, could be the man. His son Edward Wright told the Scarborough News: 'When I saw the picture on the television I immediately thought ""that’s my dad."" 'I am appealing to anyone who has the expertise to help us -we have an old photo of granddad and if anyone could help by comparing the two photographs, I would be delighted.' The footage is used in The Battle of the Somme, a 1916 British documentary and propaganda film, depicting the British Army in the preliminary and early days of the great battle. Generals hoped would prove decisive in breaking through the German lines, but turned out to be one of the greatest disasters in British military history. Mr Darkes Snr said: 'I first saw dad’s picture in a war programme I was watching about ten years ago. I just thought: ""That’s my dad!"", but I couldn’t get a video in quick enough to record it. 'Dad was born on November 19, 1888. He joined the Army in 1914 and died in 1960. 'He never mentioned the war much. He was wounded - he got blown up and lay half-buried in mud for three days until he was discovered. 'His arm was badly injured, but they said that he was saved from bleeding to death by the mud that congealed over the wound. 'They saved his arm, but it was never much use to him after that. He always worked though. He always said that the Government promised them each an acre of land and a cow - but it never happened.' However, a spokesman from the Imperial War Museum said it has yet to be convinced by any claims to have solved the mystery. A spokesman said: 'We have never been able formally to confirm any of the suggestions made to us of the identity of the soldier in the photograph and as far as we are concerned, the question remains officially open. 'It appears that there were three men who carried the wounded soldier – the man who approaches the camera was seemingly the third soldier to bear the strain of a fallen comrade. 'Geoffrey Malins, the cameraman who filmed the scene later described how “a trench mortar man” and another volunteer made the rescue, but does not say which of them actually carried the wounded man in; neither does he provide a name for either of them. 'There are no official records that we have so far been able to trace which offer any more detail than this unofficial account. 'Malins is known to have been filming in the early morning of 1 July in the sector of the front line occupied by the 1st Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, part of 29th Division, facing German positions at Beaumont Hamel. It is generally assumed that this was also filmed in or close to the same location.' As the footage of The Battle of the Somme was prepared to be shown around Britain - just four weeks after it was filmed on the battlefield. It was a huge success, and 20million people had flocked to cinemas to see the footage just six weeks after it was released. A single film would not reach so many viewers again until Star Wars in 1977. Photographs and descriptions of life on the front had been available previously, but this was the first time a moving picture of modern warfare was widely shown. Many audience members would never have seen a film before. At first was feared that the graphic depiction of war might damage morale, but instead the images of brave British soldiers struggling on the front line brought about a huge swell of support. A newspaper report at the time says: 'Crowded audiences ... were interested and thrilled to have the realities of war brought so vividly before them, and if women had sometimes to shut their eyes to escape for a moment from the tragedy of the toll of battle which the film presents, opinion seems to be general that it was wise that the people at home should have this glimpse of what our soldiers are doing and daring and suffering in Picardy.'","Unknown figure from 1916 footage was serving in the Battle of the Somme .

"Amber Vinson's family rushed to her defense today saying the Ebola-stricken nurse would not have boarded flights with symptoms of the deadly virus and put anyone else at risk. The nurse told her uncle, Lawrence Vinson, that she didn't feel ill until Tuesday morning when she went to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital - hours after disembarking her return flight from Cleveland to Dallas, according to a GMA report. He said on Friday: 'Absolutely not. Amber is one of the most conscientious individuals I know.' Mr Vinson said that 29-year-old Amber didn't contact the CDC, despite reports from the agency that she had, because she was not told  to. He added that she had followed the guidelines of self-monitoring her temperature. Scroll down for video . Amber Vinson's uncle, Lawrence Vinson said on Friday that his niece Amber Joy Vinson (pictured) would 'absolutely not' have put other travelers at risk from Ebola . Lawrence Vinson (pictured right), said on Friday that his niece (left) was given assurances by Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital that she would be safe while caring for Ebola patients . Miss Vinson, 29, was taken by chartered plane from Dallas to Atlanta Wednesday night, where she is currently being treated at Emory University Hospital . Miss Vinson did contact Texas health officials as she had been told to do, who contacted the CDC on her behalf and relayed the information back that she was safe to travel on Monday as her 99.5F fever was beneath the 100.4 threshold. Miss Vinson, 29, may have been showing symptoms of the deadly virus as early as last Friday - before she flew to Ohio for the weekend and then back to Texas, the CDC claimed on Thursday. CDC Dr Chris Braden said: 'We had started to look at the possibility that she had symptoms going back as far as Saturday.... Some more information that has come through recently says we can't rule out that she might have had the start of her symptoms on Friday.' Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital has a Film Array device, a medical machine that could have detected Ebola in less than an hour. However, doctors were barred from using the device to check for the disease because it wasn't approved by the Food and Drug Administration. US military doctors sent to West Africa to combat Ebola are already using the Film Array, which has more than 90percent accuracy. The maker of the machine, Utah-based BioFire Diagnostics has received a $240million grant from the Defense Department's Joint Program Office for Chemical and Biological Defense to hone the device to detect Ebola and other deadly pathogens. The device costs $39,000 - a pittance by the standards of medical devices in hospitals - and was developed by Utah-based BioFire Diagnostics to test the genetic markers of a slew of gastrointestinal and respiratory viruses. It can use blood or saliva samples and it's proven adept at quickly detecting Ebola, as well. The CDC made the shocking announcement after Miss Vinson was revealed as the second nurse in Dallas to contract Ebola from the U.S.'s 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan. On October 10, Miss Vinson may have had Ebola symptoms when she flew out of Dallas-Fort Worth Airport on Frontier Airlines Flight 1142 to Cleveland to plan her upcoming wedding. However her mother, Debra Berry, also spoke out to defend Amber saying that much criticism had been thrown at her daughter but that she wasn't sick when she flew to Cleveland. Her uncle added that his niece had been given assurances by her employer, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, that she would be protected while caring for Mr Duncan. He said: 'They [medical staff] were given gear that was supposed to provide isolation, and protocols to follow that they believed would protect them.' Miss Vinson's family released a statement on Thursday which thanked well-wishers for their prayers and support but also made clear that the 29-year-old nurse had done nothing wrong. It read: 'Our family has been overwhelmed with support and love for Amber and our extended family over the last 72 hours, and we thank you for those prayers and well wishes. Amber is stable, and we are continuing to work with her doctors as her treatment progresses. 'Amber is a respected professional and has always had a strong passion for nursing. She followed all of the protocols necessary when treating a patient in Dallas, and right now, she's trusting in her doctors and nurses as she is now the patient.' Nina Pham, 26, was the first nurse diagnosed with Ebola this weekend. She spoke on camera from her hospital bed on Thursday to show gratitude to those caring for her after being moved to National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland . Miss Vinson is being treated at Emory in Atlanta, Georgia where she was described as being in a stable condition. Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan, 42, was treated by two nurses who have since contracted the virus . Chief of Texas Health defended his hospital's protection of their own nurses again on Friday. Dr Daniel Varga said he wished he could have 'hermetically-sealed' those on the frontline of care for Thomas Duncan - but once again pointed out the hospital had 'been in compliance with CDC guidelines' in protective clothing for their staff. However he admitted that the hospital was not ready for the challenge of diagnosing Ebola when Mr Duncan first presented with symptoms on September 25. Dr Varga told GMA:  'We were well-prepared to take care of a patient who walked in holding a sign that says, ''I have Ebola.'' 'And a couple weeks ago it was a gentleman walking in off the street with nonspecific symptoms who happened to have Ebola. It's a different concept diagnosing Ebola than being able to treat Ebola, and being prepared to diagnose it.' The first nurse diagnosed with Ebola, 26-year-old Nina Pham, was the first caregiver to accept Thomas Duncan when he came up from the ER on September 28, after he was initially sent home. Miss Vinson was also one of the nurses to treat Duncan when he was admitted the second time in the first 'high-risk' days when there is a high volume of bodily fluids from projectile vomiting, bleeding and explosive diarrhea. Dr Varga said there had been no break in protocol from either of the nurses. Miss Pham, who was diagnosed with Ebola this weekend, was flown on Thursday to National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland after initially being treated at Texas Health. She is reportedly in a good condition. The Frontier Airlines plane that Amber Vinson flew from Cleveland to Dallas on Monday, flies out of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on Wednesday. It emerged today that Miss Vinson may have been showing symptoms on her inbound flight to Cleveland .

"A Cincinnati man who pleaded guilty in the accidental shooting death of his 11-year-old daughter has been sentenced to six years in prison. Prosecutors say 34-year-old Deandre Kelley was drunk on January 12 when he fought with his longtime girlfriend and fired two gunshots into the air. One bullet hit their daughter Shanti Lanza, who had been hiding in an upstairs bedroom. Guilty: Deandre Kelley, the man accused of killing his 11-year-old daughter during a drunken shooting spree at their home will spend the next six years behind bars. Here he is pictured at a court appearance in January . Jailed also: Tina Lanza (center), the victim's mother, was one of several people who physically erupted with emotion and vocal outbursts when the judge read the length of the prison sentence. Here she is pictured at a court appearance in January . Accidental: Shanti hid in her bedroom as her parents argued and a stray bullet accidentally hit her . Character: Shanti was planning to attend the School of Performing Arts next year, and loved singing and dancing . Kelley pleaded guilty to one count of reckless homicide in an emotional hearing Wednesday in Hamilton County court. In exchange, prosecutors dropped charges of involuntary manslaughter and endangering children, and a weapons count. Hamilton County prosecutor Joe Deters argued that Kelley arrived home intoxicated after 2 a.m. and Shanti's mother and his longtime girlfriend, Tina Lanza, forced him out of the house. Kelley then fired four shots into the air, Deters argued, one of which ended up in a second-story bedroom of the house where Shanti was hiding. The bullet struck her in the chest. 'This is the end of the road for this enabling,' Deters said after an earlier court appearance. 'He needs to be in jail and the rest of them should be looking in the mirror for the reason this little girl is dead.' Bad egg: Kelley has a lengthy arrest record and has been arrested for drug and alcohol charges . Reckless: Kelley drunkenly fired gunshots into the air, once of which hit his precious daughter . How it happened: Police say the 34-year-old Kelley fired shots into the air outside the house in January while arguing with the girl's mother and that one of the shots hit his daughters bedroom . Kelley has a lengthy arrest record and has been arrested for drug and alcohol charges. He also has been charged 3 times in 12 years with domestic violence against Kristina Lanza - with each charge later dropped. Kelley was convicted in 2003 for assault of two other people, . Kelley's attorney, Hugh McCloskey Jr., says that after talking the case over with the judge, his client realized that a six-year sentence was the best deal he was going to get. Kelley fired several gunshots with a brown revolver into the air, one of which entered the bedroom window of little Shanti Lanza, killing her. She died at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Lanza's three siblings were also in the home at the time of the incident along with some friends who were sleeping over. Violence in his blood: Kelley has been charged three times in 12 years with domestic violence against his long-time girlfrfiend and mother of his child Kristina Lanza . Antwone Kelley said his brother had left the family's home unaware that his daughter had been shot. 'He might drink a little bit but that was his child, that was his baby. He didn't mean to do this at all. He's more heartbroken than anybody,' he said. Shanti was found bleeding in her bedroom. She had been hit in the chest. She was the second of Kelley's children to be shot and killed. His son, David Gill, 16, died after a 2012 triple shooting. Their parents had been together for about 15 years, but had a troubled relationship, family members said. Kelley had been arrested for a domestic disturbance involving Shanti's mother in 2007. Vince Lanza, Shanti’s uncle, said: 'It was one of those relationships that they can't be together but they can't be without each other.' Kelley, facing more than 20 years in prison on the original manslaughter charge and other charges, was balking on a plea deal offering a six-year sentence, the minimum possible. Assistant Hamilton County Prosecutor Mark Piepmeier said prosecutors only offered the minimum because Kristina Lanza demanded the most lenient sentence possible for her boyfriend. During a break for Kelley to consider the offer, family members and friends of Kelley and Lanza argued aggressively with Piepmeier, saying the proposed six-year sentence for killing the girl was too harsh. Killed by a stray: Shanti was hiding in an upstairs bedroom whilst her parents argued. The bullet struck her in the chest and she bled to death . One husband and wife were kicked out of court; the wife, who created an uproar in the hall, was arrested. Tina Lanza was one of several people who physically erupted with emotion and vocal outbursts when Allen read the length of the prison sentence. She and Danielle Lott, who identified herself as Shanti's aunt, were held in contempt of court after ignoring multiple requests to tone down their behavior, Allen said. Both women will appear in court on Thursday for a contempt hearing. 'I've handled dozens and dozens of child murders in my career,' prosecutor Piepmeier said. ""This is the first time I've ever had the mother of a murder victim tell me we're treating the person that killed her child too harshly. 'It just makes you scratch your head sometimes, makes you wonder where people are coming from.'","Deandre Kelley pleaded guilty to manslaughter over Shanti Lanza's death .

"Jailed: Joseph Collier, 72, from Dulwich, has been sentenced to 15 months in prison after being found guilty of taking in stolen metal from cemeteries . A scrap metal dealer who bought hundreds of bronze memorial plaques that were stolen from cemeteries has been jailed for 15 months. Joseph Collier, 72, was found guilty last month of taking the stolen metal and cutting it up in to unidentifiable pieces that he sold on. Some of the plaques were still screwed to the stakes used to plant them at cemeteries across south London including Croydon, Teddington, Putney Vale and Beckenham. And footage shown to the jury during Collier's six-day trial at Croydon Crown Court showed some of the pieces were still caked with fresh mud and grass. Today he was told that the worth of the plaques 'can't be valued in monetary terms' and that their theft 'would have caused distress' to the loved ones of the deceased. Police raided Collier's DSM Scrap Metal Yard in Croydon in May 2012 as part of a London-wide crackdown on metal theft. During the raid, they found boxes and bags containing more than 723 memorial plaques, as well as a stolen bronze dragon and a £1,800 statue of Jesus that was stolen from a grave in Putney Vale. Many of the plaques had been cut up into small pieces in an attempt to disguise them. In order to identify where the plaques had been stolen from, officers from Croydon spent several hours piecing them back together. They were later able to identify 250 names on the plaques, which included those placed as recently as 2012. Collier, from Dulwich, south London was arrested and charged with offences the following day and was bailed pending his court appearance. But 10 months later, suspicious that Collier was continuing to receive stolen goods, police set up an undercover operation where an officer offered him reels of copper worth £800 - making it clear that they were stolen. Collier was found guilty of three counts of possession of criminal property, one count of disguising criminal property and one count of attempting to receive stolen goods last month. His lawyer, James Martin, told Isleworth Crown Court today: 'He fully appreciates the seriousness of the offending and the suffering to the families of loved ones. 'He said when he read it in the newspaper he felt like a grave robber. Scroll down for video . Raid: Police found boxes and bags containing more than 723 memorial plaques, as well as a stolen bronze dragon and a  statue of Jesus when they searched Collier's DSM Scrap Metal Yard in Croydon in May 2012 . Haul: Some of the plaques were still screwed to the stakes used to plant them at cemeteries across south London including Croydon, Teddington, Putney Vale and Beckenham when police discovered them last year . 'He was running a legitimate business, but in a way that was asking no questions. He's taken people on face value and not asked the proper and appropriate questions.' Collier claims the scrap value of the plaques was only £4,000, but the police say the cost to replace them to bereaved families would be £17,000 to £30,000. He fought the case and even tried to dodge responsibility when interviewed by the probation service after his conviction. Mr Martin said: 'He was explaining just because they were plaques didn't mean they were stolen.' Business: CCTV footage at the Croydon scrap yard (pictured), showed Collier (left) overseeing the cutting-up of the memorial plaques by his machines. He claimed the scrap value of the plaques was only £4,000 . CCTV: Collier, pictured left overseeing the plaques, was found guilty of three counts of possession of criminal property, one count of disguising criminal property and one count of attempting to receive stolen goods . Dedicated: In order to identify where the plaques had been stolen from, officers from Croydon spent several hours piecing them back together. They were later able to identify 250 names on the plaques . Stolen: When officers raided Collier's business in 2012 they found boxes of plaques ready to be cut up into smaller pieces (left) while others looked as though they had come straight from the ground (right) 'He's lost his business now, that's a huge blow to him. He's a man who's literally worked every day of his life. 'There's no chance anyone is going to give him a scrap licence again and he doesn't know what to do with himself.' The first cemetery targeted by thieves was Croydon in September, 2011. Over 200 were later stolen from Beckenham, 148 from Tonbridge & Malling, 300 from West Norwood and nine from Putney Vale.","Joseph Collier bought plaques that were stolen from graves in London area .

"A man who boasted on The Jeremy Kyle Show that he was a 'superstud' has been jailed for life after brutally murdering his friend's grandmother so he could steal her £104 pension to pay for a night out. Liam Naylor, 23, went to the home of Doreen Walker in Cudworth, Barnsley, before stabbing her in the heart and slashing her across the face more than 40 times. Now the father-of-four, who was on the TV show for a DNA test and bragged he 'impregnated every woman' he slept with, has been told he will spend a minimum of 33 years behind bars. Scroll down for video . Liam Naylor appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show for a DNA test in 2013 and bragged he was a 'superstud' Liam Naylor (left), 23, brutally murdered Doreen Walker (right) in her home in Cudworth, Barnsley for £104 . Just five months after his television appearance, Naylor, 23, throttled, beat and stabbed 75-year-old Doreen Walker in her own home. Naylor carried out the savage attack before paying for a night out with friends using the grandmother's stolen £104 pension cash. Jailing Naylor, Judge Julian Goose said: 'This was a savage, cruel and brutal attack with a large kitchen knife. 'This was a murder for gain so you could steal her pension money - £104. After that you arranged to go our with your friends and spent it on drink, cigarettes and takeaway food. This was a particularly serious murder.' He went on: 'Even more chilling during the time you were in the house you were texting your friends to make arrangements for your night out.' Mrs Walker's daughter Sharon Jones said in a victim impact statement: 'She was such a loving, kind woman and saw the good in everybody and was too trusting at times. 'How could she be taken from us by someone she took into her own home. She didn't deserve to die like this.' Naylor appeared on the programme just five months before he stabbed Doreen Walker to death in her home . Naylor was captured on CCTV entering Mrs Walker's home about 9.30pm and emerged two hours later . Following the attack Naylor, who has four children to two different partners, then tried to wash the blood from his hands and went upstairs and stole the money which he had earlier placed in a jewellery box. Liam Naylor appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show on November 1, 2013. He had told host Kyle that although he had split up with his ex-girlfriend, he had slept with her since and was the father of her young child. But she claimed he was lying and he demanded a DNA test to prove he was the biological father. He told Kyle: 'I get everybody pregnant. I have two kids and one on the way. I impregnate every woman I have been with.' Naylor claimed his ex had cheated on him three times and he no longer loved her. He told the host the only thing he wanted was to be there for his children. But his ex-girlfriend then claimed he 'stole' money which should have gone to his children. Kyle eventually revealed the paternity test results which showed that Naylor was the father. He then laid his victim's head on a cushion on the floor. In his defence, Naylor claimed the pensioner had 'jumped into the knife' after he disarmed her when she attacked him and then he used the knife on her. He told the court that he feared for his own safety. 'I felt it was the right thing to do to calm her down,' he said. Naylor was found guilty of murder by a jury at Sheffield Crown Court after a week-long trial. Simon Waley, prosecuting, said Naylor's claim of self-defence was 'ludicrous and utterly incredible.' He said the attack on the grandmother, who had three children and five grandchildren, was savage, brutal and sustained.' Just three weeks earlier Naylor and his friend Keeley Sweeney had stayed with Mrs Walker who is Miss Sweeney's grandmother. After killing Mrs Walker at her three bedroom home, Naylor, whose jeans were covered in blood, told friends he had been in a fight. He texted: 'I want to get drunk. Get me some clothes ready.' He then went out in Barnsley with two friends. Naylor paid for drinks at a bar, food at McDonalds and a taxi. Police arrested Naylor after Mrs Walker's body was found in her home the following morning by her son-in-law . He gave himself up the next day in Skegness. It was only when later presented with the prosecution evidence that he changed his story claiming Mrs Walker had attacked him after he went to steal her money. He claimed in the witness box: 'She basically jumped at me and punched me. As she did so she just jumped into the knife.' The victim's son-in-law found Mrs Walker's body the next day on April 2 after neighbours smashed their way into the house. On the Jeremy Kyle show on November 1 last year, Naylor said although he had split up with his ex-girlfriend he had slept with her since and was the father of her young child. She said he was lying but he replied: 'I get everybody pregnant. I have two kids and one on the way. I impregnate every woman I have been with.' Naylor claimed his ex had cheated on him three times and he no longer loved her. 'The only thing I want to be there for is my kids,' he said. His ex then claimed he 'stole' money which should have gone to his children. Kyle eventually revealed the paternity test results which showed that Naylor was the father. After the hearing investigating officer Det Supt Richard Fewkes said: 'It remains unclear what was going through his mind when he committed one of the most brutal murders I have dealt with in my 29 years in the force. 'It was brutal, savage and unprovoked. The account he put forward that he was acting in self-defence was ludicrous and the evidence against him was overwhelming. 'I have watched Liam Naylor give evidence throughout the trial and there has been an air of arrogance about him. On occasions he was smiling. That sums him up. 'Dorothy was very much a home bird. She was elderly, frail and had the onset of arthritis but showed great kindness and on occasions she extended that kindness to Naylor which makes this offence even more abhorrent.'","Liam Naylor stabbed Doreen Walker, 75, over 40 times to steal her pension .

"Couple: Adolf Hitler with Eva Braun, who may have been descended from a Jewish family . When they committed suicide in his bunker at the end of the Second World War, Eva Braun had been Adolf Hitler’s mistress for more than 12 years and his wife for a mere 40 hours. It seems, however, that despite their time together, she may have kept a crucial family secret from the Fuhrer. For the man who exterminated millions of Jews in the war may have been in love with a woman with Jewish ancestry. DNA analysis of hair found on a brush that belonged to her seems to show a link through her maternal line, it  emerged yesterday. Hitler kept Miss Braun, who was 23 years his junior and a teenager when she first met him, largely hidden away at his Alpine residence, the Berghof. Scientists tested hair samples which are said to have come from a hairbrush used by Braun and discovered at Hitler’s  mountain retreat. They found a particular sequence within the DNA, which had been passed down the maternal line – the haplogroup N1b1 – which it is claimed is ‘strongly associated’ with Ashkenazi Jews, who make up around 80 per cent of the global Jewish population. Many Ashkenazi Jews in Germany converted to Catholicism in the 19th century. The test was made for Channel 4 programme Dead Famous DNA, to be shown on Wednesday. Presenter Mark Evans said: ‘This is a thought-provoking outcome. I never dreamt I would find such a potentially extraordinary and profound result.’ Although programme-makers said the provenance of the hair was strong, the only way to prove beyond doubt that it was from Miss Braun would have been to take a DNA swab from one of her two surviving female descendants, but both refused, so there is still an element of mystery. Found: The brush and a mirror, both pictured, were taken from Eva Braun's private apartment in Bavaria . Dinner: Hitler and Eva Braun. The tests were inconclusive because Braun's descendants refused a DNA test . Private life: This photograph of the Fuhrer sleeping next to Eva Braun was banned during his lifetime . The hairs came from a monogrammed brush found at the Bavarian residence in 1945 by US army intelligence officer Captain Paul Baer, who took a number of items from Braun’s private apartment. His son Alan Baer said: ‘In our basement I remember there was a duffel bag and in the duffel bag there were several Nazi ceremonial daggers, a human skull and this case with the initials in gold, E.B. 'We opened it up and there was a mirror and a hairbrush.’ After his father’s death in the 1970s, Mr Baer sold the brush and the hair ended up with specialist dealer John Reznikoff. Mr Evans bought eight strands of the hair from Mr Reznikoff for £1,200. Mistress: The pair wed in Hitler's bunker less than two days before he took his own life .

"The era of hope is over. If the results of the US midterm elections have been a huge setback for the Democrats, they were a personal catastrophe for Barack Obama. They were even worse than the most pessimistic forecasts of his party’s strategists, amounting to a comprehensive rejection of his governance. With the Republicans now in control of both the upper and lower Houses of Congress, the twilight of Obama’s presidency has begun. Battered: President Barack Obama's dire poll results had echoes of Ukip's rising popularity in the UK . The man who once electrified the American nation with his soaring oratory – and titled his book on political philosophy The Audacity Of Hope – is now the lamest of ducks in the White House, mired in unpopularity and devoid of allies. In this election, Democrat candidates saw him as a liability rather than an asset – with most of them running away from him like scalded cats. But the attempt to quarantine the President paid no dividends for his party. Both the scale and geographical spread of their defeat was remarkable, with Democrats losing Senate seats across the country, from Montana to West Virginia. In former president Bill Clinton’s home state of Arkansas, there are now two Republican senators for the first time since the 19th century, while the Republicans now have their largest majority in the House since 1928. The president addresses the nation after speaking about the US midterm election results, where the Republicans gained control of both Houses of Congress . The results are a reminder that America still retains its vast conservative heartlands. Despite the reality of demographic change – with the black and Hispanic populations expanding rapidly – and all the talk about a progressive transformation of the country triggered by Obama’s first election in 2008, it is clear that a large swathe of the US electorate still holds to traditional values about the family, free enterprise and a limited role for government. Indeed, in contrast to the optimism inspired by Obama in 2008, a large majority of the public are profoundly concerned about the country’s direction. One recent poll showed that 67 per cent of voters think that America is ‘on the wrong track’. Several factors have contributed to this bleak mood. One is the perceived weakness in foreign policy. Americans might be fed up with war, but they are concerned about the seeming reluctance of the White House to challenge effectively aggression overseas, whether it be by Putin in Ukraine or Islamic extremists in the Middle East. The election proved to be a successful one for the Republican party. Pictured are Republican Thom Tills and his wife Susan celebrating results in Charlotte, North Carolina . Perhaps more important is the sluggish state of the US economy. Just as in Britain, living standards have continued to fall despite a rise in employment. Part of the great American dream has always been that, if you work hard, you will be able to build a better life for yourself and your family. This outlook has been central to the phenomenal success of America, where, until now, every generation has been wealthier than its predecessor. But now the dream is fading. Even those who put in long hours now fear that they will be less well off than their parents – and for this, some of the blame is directed towards President Obama. There is no doubt that, in 2008, he inherited a desperately tough legacy from George W Bush, thanks to wars abroad and recession at home. In fact, as Sandy Berger, a former National Security Adviser, told me, no incoming president had faced a more difficult job since Franklin D Roosevelt in 1933 at the height of the Great Depression. But after six years in power, Obama can no longer evade the responsibility for domestic and overseas failure. A further factor in the anti-Democrat landslide was the greater cohesiveness and moderation from most Republican candidates. Meanwhile the election proved to be a huge setback for the Democrats. Pictured is Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn conceding to Republican candidate David Perdue in Georgia . In recent years, the Republican party has sometimes given the impression that it is being held hostage by Right-wing activists, a negative image fuelled by the influence of the hardline Tea Party movement. But now, after a period in the wilderness, the Republicans seem to be getting the message about the need to fight on the centre ground and reflect the diversity of America. Interestingly, one of the most high profile Congressional victories was that of Mia Love in Utah, the first Republican black woman to be elected to the House. Yet the Republicans cannot afford to be complacent. With turnout low and apathy prevalent, it would be wrong to exaggerate the implications of these results. One of the main reasons for the Republicans’ success is that their supporters were more galvanised to vote than Democrats. Despite widespread disillusion with Obama, there is no evidence of an overwhelming transfer of allegiance to the Republicans. One recent survey showed that 59 per cent of voters are ‘dissatisfied’ with the Democrats, but 60 per cent have similar feelings towards the Republicans. What we are witnessing is an accelerating distrust towards all mainstream politicians. It is a similar discontent with the political establishment that we see here in Britain, reflected in the rise of Ukip and the mounting unpopularity of all main parties. (One opinion poll last week put the combined support for Labour and the Tories on just 59 per cent.) One recent survey showed that 59 per cent of voters are ‘dissatisfied’ with the Democrats, but 60 per cent have similar feelings towards the Republicans . One person to benefit from all this is Hillary Clinton, who is almost certain to be the Democrats’ candidate to succeed Obama. She might benefit from the Republican domination of Congress – meaning that she can run as the challenger to the Washington establishment, just as Harry Truman did in 1948 against the ‘Do Nothing Congress’. Despite a health scare in 2012 when Hillary suffered a blood clot, she is now fighting fit. She has built a formidable electoral machine and will run as a centrist moderate. For his part, Obama’s last years in office will be a period of stagnation. His remoteness as an individual is in graphic contrast to Ronald Reagan’s easy charm, which enabled him to work successfully with a Democrat-led House of Representatives and the Senate in the 1980s, with deals often reached over a glass of whisky. But relations between the Washington parties today are more rancorous. Crucially, deadlock in Washington is bad news for the wider world. We face huge global challenges, such as the threat of militant Islam and the ongoing collapse of the eurozone. America, still the world’s greatest superpower, should be giving a lead to the West but is hopelessly divided and politically paralysed. And so the lame-duck president is now likely to spend even more time on the golf course because there is not much he can usefully do in the White House. Last month, it was revealed that he had played 200 rounds since becoming president. There will be many more in the empty presidential days that lie ahead – even though turmoil rages elsewhere. Gavin Esler is a presenter on BBC News . The legalisation of marijuana in some parts of America may end up being the long-lasting legacy of Barack Obama’s presidency. Washington DC, Oregon and Alaska voted in favour of legalising the drug for recreational use by adults this week, following in the wake of Colorado and Washington state. Mr Obama has previously spoken on how he smoked cannabis in his youth and said he does not think it is any more dangerous than alcohol . Republicans are determined to dismantle Mr Obama’s controversial healthcare reform – his administration’s biggest policy change – which would be humiliating for a president who says he is determined to leave a permanent mark on the US. However, he has little to show for all his bold talk on foreign policy, the environment, immigration and the economy. Despite marijuana’s links to two deaths in Colorado and growing scientific evidence that it is harmful to young people, pro-cannabis legalisers have been able to play on its value to cash-strapped states as a lucrative tax revenue source. Mr Obama has spoken of how he smoked the drug in his youth and has said he does not think it is any more dangerous than alcohol. He agrees with reformers who say legalising cannabis would stop the stream of young black and Hispanic people who are jailed for possessing small amounts. Even before he entered the White House, Mr Obama told historian Doris Kearns Goodwin that he was intent on being remembered by history. ‘I have no desire to be one of those presidents who are just on the list – you see their pictures lined up on the wall… I really want to be a president who makes a difference,’ he said.","The US midterm elections were a catastrophe for president Barack Obama .

"'Perverted' Michael Cropton met a 'needy' woman on an internet dating site before convincing her to help him abuse two girls . A mother has been jailed after she helped a paedophile she met online to abuse two girls in return for shoes and a ring. Michael Cropton, 42, met the 39-year-old woman on an internet dating site and persuaded her to assist him in abusing two girls. A court heard Cropton bombarded the woman with texts demanding she help him and she replied: 'If I say yes, do I get my ring and my shoes?'. Cropton, of Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, was handed a 20-year sentence after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to sexually assault two girls. The girls, both under the age of 11, told police officers he had touched them and kissed them. Cropton also admitted four counts of rape, relating to a young boy under the age of 17. The woman co-defendant, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to sexually assault the girls and was given two years and eight months behind bars. Stephen Mooney, prosecuting, told Bristol Crown Court: 'From July to September, 2013, nearly 12,000 texts passed between them. 'The texts moved from sexually explicit to questions about girls she knew and whether she would be prepared to incorporate them into their sexual activities. 'Ultimately, she succumbed to his requests and became a willing participant in sexual activity between him and the girls.' The pair met on a dating website in 2013 before going to a local pub together. After meeting, Cropton began sending explicit messages, encouraging the woman to help him fulfil his  sexual desires. Rosaleen Collins, defending the woman, added: 'There is, quite clearly, an emotional background. Many would call her needy. 'She desperately wanted respect and love from male company. She was, in many ways, a sitting duck. He persuaded her to agree. She resisted time after time after time. 'She told him about her abuse as a child. She was taken in by him. She was not able to recognise the manipulation to which she was being subjected.' Cropton will serve an extended licence period, be placed on the sex offenders' register and receive a Sexual Offenders Prevention Order (SOPO) to run indefinitely. Both Cropton and the woman who helped him were jailed this week at Bristol Crown Court (pictured) Sentencing, Judge Michael Roach, said: 'The defendant met his co-accused in the summer of 2013 on a dating website. 'She allowed him to sexually abuse girls and 12,000 texts were exchanged. The texts make horrific reading. The requests were brazen, persistent and highly manipulative. She accepts exposing the girls to the sexual abuse of her co-defendant. 'She was subjected to a barrage of texts from the co-accused, pressing for her to allow her to sexually abuse the girls. She had been needy. She allowed herself to become involved in Mr Cropton's perverted ambition.' Speaking after the case, Det Insp Gary Stephens, of the Public Protection Unit, said: 'This has been a distressing and harrowing investigation involving the horrific sexual abuse of children. 'Michael Cropton is a devious and manipulative man who used classic grooming techniques to identify vulnerable children he could abuse. 'He admitted these offences due to the overwhelming evidence against him which resulted from the hard work of the investigation team. 'We believe there could be more victims out there and I hope the outcome of this case will encourage people to come forward and speak to us in confidence. 'I would also appeal to anyone who has been in a relationship with Michael Cropton to please get in touch with us. Cropton is now in the right place and the community is a much safer place without him in it.'","Sex offender Michael Cropton met the woman on internet dating website .

"Motorists may be forced to pay more to get their cars serviced after the industry's peak body froze out small and independent mechanics in a new code of conduct. The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries has issued its own voluntary code of conduct for car servicing that stops smaller workshops from accessing complete maintenance data and specialist tools that new-car dealership service centres are entitled to. The move has been criticised by the Australian Automobile Association - the body for motorists - who claim it will reduce choice for consumers and force them into more expensive dealership servicing programs.

'This shows complete arrogance and contempt on behalf of the car makers,' Andrew McKellar, chief executive of the Association told News Corp.

'It is a complete con. They're putting forward the appearance they're doing the right thing but if you dig into the detail it heavily restricts what is available (to local mechanics).' Smaller mechanics have argued that as vehicles become more modern and technologically advanced, they need more access to maintenance information than stipulated in the code. Tony Weber, the chief executive of FCAI, issued a statement saying a 2012 Commonwealth Consumer Affairs Advisory Council (CCAAC) review found there was no evidence of disadvantage to the consumer regarding the sharing of repair information in the industry. Andrew McKellar, chief executive of the Australian Automobile Association, says the new code shows little concern for the consumer . The council recommended the auto industry develop a code of practice to ensure there was a process for independent mechanics to access repair information. 'Now, 23 months later, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries and the Australian Automotive Dealer Association are the only organisations that appear to be making progress on this matter,' Mr Webber said. It is compulsory in the United States and Europe for car companies to make available maintenance data to both new car dealership service centres and independent mechanics.","Automotive industry issued its own voluntary code of conduct that stops smaller mechanics from accessing maintenance data .

"Up to 24million workers are to get a break down of exactly where their taxes are spent. The personalised statements will show that more than one pound in every five goes on welfare, more than any other area of spending. Chancellor George Osborne hopes by showing millions of people where their money goes, voters will be more willing to accept more years of austerity. New personal tax statements will spell out where tax and National Insurance is spent. This one is for someone earning £30,000 . Up to 24million personal tax statements will be sent out, like this one for someone earning £30,0000 . The breakdown shows that around 23 per cent of all taxes go on welfare, 19 per cent on health and 15 per cent on pensions. Education accounts for 13 per cent. The next largest amount - 7 per cent - is money just used to pay the interest on the nation's debts. Defence and criminal justice make up 5 per cent each of all spending, with transport 3 per cent. Government administration, culture, environment, housing and business spending account for only 2 per cent each. The UK contribution to the European Union budget is equivalent to just 0.87 per cent of spending. The controversial policy to increase spending on foreign aid mean 0.55 per cent of personal tax goes on overseas aid. Chancellor George Osborne, pictured giving a speech about changes to tax, hopes by showing millions of people where their money goes, voters will be more willing to accept more years of austerity .

"The granddaughter of Mao Zedong has been ranked on a list of China’s richest people, with a personal wealth of £525million. Kong Dongmei, 41, has been accused of hypocrisy after placing 242nd on the list alongside her husband - quite a feat in a country with a population of nearly 1.4billion. Ms Kong, the daughter of Li Min, Mao's . only surviving child with his third wife He Zizhen, is believed to have . made part of her fortune from selling publications about her famous . grandfather. Rich legacy:  Kong Dongmei, right, granddaughter of the father of Communist China, Mao Zedong, is the 242nd richest person in China - a country with a population of nearly 1.4 billion . Ms Kong married insurance company boss . Chen Dongsheng, in 2011 after a 15-year extramarital affair, according . to Chinese financial magazine New Fortune which published the rich list. After obtaining a masters degree at U.S. University of Pennsylvania, Kong returned to China and opened up her own bookstore in Beijing in 2001, set up to promote ‘New Red Culture’. In a rare interview with China Daily, Kong Dongmei revealed that it was Mao who gave her the name Dongmei - after himself. 'Grandfather chose the name Dongmei. Dong from his own name, and mei from his favorite flower, the plum blossom,' she told the paper in 2010. Speaking about her dream to promote 'Red Culture' she said her aim was to 'offer a modern and diversified perspective on revolutionary history'. 'Hypocrite': Ms Kong is thought to have made part of her £525millionj fortune from her business promoting 'Red Culture' and selling publications about her grandfather Mao Zedong, pictured, and the history of communism in China . Kong and her husband is also said to have three children, a son and two daughters, a violation of China’s one-child policy. Kong's inclusion on the rich list triggered hot debate on Weibo - China's version of Twitter, with some accusing her of betraying her grandfather's status as the ‘great teacher of proletariat revolution’. ‘The offspring of Chairman Mao, who led us to eradicate private ownership, married a capitalist and violated the family planning policy to give birth to three illegal children,’ wrote Luo Chongmin, a government adviser in southwest China. China has implemented the one-child policy for many urban residents for over 30 years, although there have been recent suggestions that the rules may be loosened. ‘Did Kong Dongmei ... pay any fines after being a mistress for more than 10 years and giving birth to three kids?’ asked another user with the online handle Virtual Liangshao. But others argued that the millions were actually her husband's, who made his fortune before they were married. ‘Kong just married a wealthy husband. You can't attribute it to Mao,’ said Weibo user Wang Nanfang in a posting.","Mao Zedong's granddaughter accused of hypocrisy after ranking on rich list .

"Comedy actor James Corden, whose hit series Gavin & Stacey was given its big break by BBC3, has backed the decision to axe the TV channel and move its output online. The BBC has earmarked the station for a move to its iPlayer service from 2015, which it says would save millions to reinvest in other programming. The plan to scrap the channel after 11 years has faced criticism from many of its stars, including Jack Whitehall and Richard Bacon, who have started a Twitter protest to block director general Tony Hall’s move. Backing: Comedy actor James Corden, pictured with Gavin & Stacey co-star Ruth Jones, has backed the decision to axe BBC3 and move its output online . However, Mr Corden, who wrote and starred in one of BBC3's biggest hits Gavin & Stacey, said the youth audience which the station is aimed was comfortable with viewing programmes on a computer rather than via a television. 'I think it should always be at the . forefront of what is fresh and exciting, and therefore it should be the . first channel to exist online,"" he told The Guardian at the Advertising Week Europe event in London. 'Providing . they still invest and it's still a commitment to make new and . interesting shows, then its audience will find them in the same way you . and I enjoy House Of Cards (on Netflix).' Success story: Gavin & Stacey, which was written by Mr Corden and Ruth Jones, began life on BBC3 in 2007 but as its success grew, it graduated to BBC1 . Younger audience: Mr Corden, who played Smithy in the popular show, said he did not know if Gavin & Stacey would be commissioned by BBC3 today . Mr Corden said he was happy that the BBC remained committed to investing in young writers, performers and directors and that the corporation would continue to cater for its young audience. The online-only move was proposed last month and is expected to deliver savings of up to £50 million a year, which the corporation says will be ploughed back into enhancing BBC1. However, more than 225,000 people have signed a petition opposing the plan. When the move to shut down the channel was announced, Mr Whitehall, . who appears in the BBC3 comedy Bad Education, claimed it was . vital for fostering new talent. Matt Lucas, who starred in Little . Britain with David Walliams, said the thought of the channel’s demise were ‘horrible’. New project: Mr Corden's most recent comedy drama The Wrong Mans was screened by BBC2, and was co-produced with American TV on demand service Hulu . Comedy series Gavin & Stacey, which was written by Mr Corden and co-star Ruth Jones, began life on BBC3 in 2007 but . as its success grew, it graduated to BBC1. It told the story of a young couple . conducting a long-distance relationship between Barry in Wales and . Billericay in Essex and their subsequent marriage, . 'The truth is, I don't know if Gavin & Stacey would be commissioned by BBC3 today,' Mr Corden said. 'The channel has changed. It was 2007 that we made that show. It has a much younger outlook.' New home: The move to iPlayer was proposed last month and is expected to deliver savings of up to £50 million a year, which the corporation says will be ploughed back into enhancing BBC1 . Controversial: Director general Tony Hall's move to move BBC3 online has been met with criticism from some of the channel's other stars . Mr Corden's most recent comedy . drama The Wrong Mans was screened by BBC2, and was co-produced with American TV on demand service Hulu. He said that the success of similar services such as Netflix, which enables viewers to stream television programmes and films to their televisions or computers showed that BBC3 could continue to flourish online. He also pointed out that some of the channel's shows were already premiered on iPlayer, before being shown on television. Last year an episode of Bad Education was seen nearly three million times on iPlayer, making it the service's fourth most watched show in 2013. Bad move: Bad Education star Jack Whitehall said BBC3's support of new comedy was 'vital' Despite James Corden's support of the move to make BBC3 online only, many of the channel's other stars have spoken out against the decision. In the wake of reports of the channel's demise, comedians including Jack Whitehall, Matt Lucas and Russell Kane, as well as presenters Nick Grimshaw, Greg James and Richard Bacon all took to Twitter in a bid to save BBC3. Whitehall, who appears in BBC3 show Bad Education wrote: 'I really hope reports that the BBC may kill BBC3 are just rumours. Their support of new comedy in particular is vital!' And BBC Radio 1 breakfast DJ Grimshaw, who also presents panel show Sweat The Small Stuff, described BBC3 as 'silly, funny, smart, young and essential'. Like Gavin & Stacey, Little Britain was also first aired on BBC3 and its star Matt Lucas said closing the channel would be 'really bad for new comedy. Like, really bad. Little Britain, Gavin & Stacey, Torchwood, Being Human, Mighty Boosh, Pramface, Ideal – BBC3 is the home of new comedy and drama.' In 2010, the BBC was forced to abandon plans to axe Radio 6Music after its stars organised a vocal public protest. 5Live presenter Bacon threatened to stage a similar campaign against the proposed BBC3 cut, saying: ‘BBC3 makes lots of great, clever, distinct programmes. If the rumours of it being cut are true, we might need to retool that 6Music campaign.’ Comedian Russell Kane, claimed the channel was the ‘crucible of upcoming comedic artists’, and . Presenter Greg James, who also regularly appears on the channel, said: ‘Such a load of balls if the rumours about BBC3 being axed are true. Brilliant new comedy and live music needs that platform.’ However, others have supported the proposal and expressed relief that Lord Hall will at least save BBC4.

"An 11-year-old boy has been banned from lessons with his classmates after teachers said that his hair had been cut too short. Callum Freeman fell foul of 'zero-tolerance' rules at St Benedict Voluntary Catholic Academy in Derby after getting a haircut with ultra-short, grade one sides. His mother, Sam Tillson, claims her son has been told he cannot rejoin his peers until his hair grows back because his short back and sides breaches the school's dress code. Short: Callum Freeman sports the short-back-and-sides haircut that has led to him being banned from lessons . She accuses the school of putting her son into 'isolation' and has claimed he is falling behind in his education after being blocked from school. She hasn't sent Callum to school since he was punished for the haircut. But teachers say that they still want him to attend school - just not in his regular classes. Ms Tillson said: 'He had his hair cut during a day off last week. He had it shorter than usual because he doesn’t like having it cut and it would save going again in the near future. 'I wasn’t aware that pupils could not have a grade one cut, which this is, I thought it would only be wrong if his head was fully shaved or coloured. 'He was put into isolation when he went back to school last Friday and I arranged for his grandfather to fetch him home the same day and he hasn’t been back since. 'I was told he couldn’t return until it grew again but that could be weeks and he is already behind in his lessons.'

St Benedict Voluntary Catholic Academy in Derby: Teachers say that Callum is not banned from school, merely not allowed in regular classes - and they still want him to attend . St Benedict's headteacher Dr Chris Reynolds said Callum had not been isolated and that merely placed in an ‘opportunities room’, instead of his normal timetable. 'We have a zero-tolerance policy towards breaking school rules,' he said. 'This will result in pupils being placed in our opportunities room, which is not isolation, where there are several other pupils and a teacher. 'He has not been told that he cannot be in school and we would far sooner have Callum here.'","Callum Freeman's mother says that teachers have put her son in 'isolation'

"An island owner has been forced to sell his lavish resort for less than half of the asking price, after being on the market for two years. Vaughan Bullivant, founder of Nature's Own, bought Daydream Island in the Whitsundays, which is located off the central coast of Queensland, Australia, in 2000 for $25 million. Mr Bullivant hoped to sell the resort for $65 million but after being on the market for two years and his health deteriorating, the entrepreneur's agents urged Mr Bullivant to slash the island's price to $30 million. Vaughan Bullivant, founder of Nature's Own, has been forced to sell his island, Daydream Island in the Whitsundays, located off the central coast of Queensland, for half the price he was hoping for - $30 million . Although it is not the price Mr Bullivant was hoping for, if sold, it will still be one of the highest sales for a resort island, according to The Daily Telegraph. Other islands that have recently been sold are Lindeman Island, also in the Whitsundays, which was bought for $12 million, Orpheus Island, a national park in North Queensland, for $6.25 million and Bedarra Island, in the Family Islands National Park, off the Queensland coast, which sold for just under $5 million. Another island owner who was expecting a high profit from his land is Peter Bond. He owns Dunk Island, in the Cassowary Coast Region, in Queensland, which was valued at $52 million but now is only worth $7.5 million after Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Mr Bond is spending more than $20 million to fix  damages on his island. But Wayne Bunz, CBRE Hotels' agent, is positive a 'passionate' buyer will show interest in Mr Bullivant's Daydream resort. 'You need passionate people to buy these island resorts,' said Mr Bunz. 'There’s romance, there’s prestige and ego with owning your own island, and the thing is you could buy Daydream for less than what some people’s private residence is worth in Sydney or Toorak (Melbourne).' Peter Bond owner of Dunk Island in the Cassowary Coast Region in Queensland thought he would receive $52 million for his island. Now it is worth $7.5 million after Cyclone Yasi in 2011 . Mr Bunz said the 4.5 star resort has video commercials in Mandarin to target Asian investors. 'The Chinese are absolutely in love with the Great Barrier Reef, so we’re hopeful we’ll get some renewed interest,' Mr Bunz said. “The key thing is for the Chinese, that if you look around at any major economy, Australia is seen as a pretty safe haven to invest.' The Daydream resort is made up of 296 rooms and makes a profit of $27 million each year. Mr Bunz said a potential buyer could make changes to the resort, transforming it to a more luxurious stay. 'The thing is hotels and islands need a facelift every five to seven years if they want to protect marketshare.' Mr Bullivant hopes the island will be sold by Christmas, giving buyers a chance to register their interest until November 6.","Founder of Nature's Own, Vaughan Bullivant, has been forced to sell his Daydream resort island  in Queensland for $30 million .

"A bronze statue of David Cameron riding a bicycle was sold for around £25,000 at a Tory fundraising party, it emerged today. Conservative party donor Nathan Steinberg  bought the bizarre ornament at the United & Cecil Club's gala dinner in London – where Chancellor George Osborne was the guest of honour. The statue, which portrays Mr Cameron on his bike as leader of opposition, was given to the party several years ago by its sculptor Margarita Hernandez. Tory donor Nathan Steinberg shows off the bronze statue of David Cameron at the fund-raising event held by United and Cecil at the Carlton Hotel, Knightsbridge . Guests at last night's lavish do dined on Mediterranean vegetable terrine, chicken with goose fat potatoes and a lemon tart with ice cream with French wine and Champagne to drink. One guest at the event revealed she had ordered Prosecco but was told she could only have Champagne. Nara Hodge, who lives in David Cameron's Oxfordshire constituency, sent a Twitter message: 'Serves me right. Next time I'll know what to ask for!' The United & Cecil Club has donated more than £400,000 to the Conservative Party since the last election. Wealthy Tory supporters can give up to £7,500 without disclosing their identity as long as it is donated through a private members club like the United and Cecil. Since the last election, private clubs have given all political parties more than £5.5million. Mr Steinberg would not say how much money the gala dinner raised for the party. He said: 'It is a members' club. I cannot breach the confidence of our members. If you or anyone wants to join, they can apply.' In ticket sales alone the evening raised at least £90,000, while adding at least another £40,000 through an auction, a source told the Guardian. Guests paid £250 a head to attend. Chancellor George Osborne was the guest of honour at the exclusive fundraising party. The bronze statue of the Prime Minister depicts him cycling, which has been forced to give up since winning the election in 2010 . Andrew Bridgen, the MP for North West Leicestershire, said the Tories had to compete with Labour's union backers. He said: 'We can't go to Len McCluskey for another million. This is how we do it.' But Labour's Jon Ashworth called for David Cameron to reveal exactly who was funding the Tories. The shadow Cabinet Office minister said: 'Yet again top Tories are dining with big money backers. 'The Tories' general election campaign is being bankrolled by a shadowy elite through this secretive group. The Tories want to buy the election by giving privileged access to a privileged few. 'Since the last election, the Tories have been given millions by unincorporated associations, organisations which don't have to declare where all their money comes from. 'We now need to know who is behind United and Cecil Club and the contact they have had with senior conservatives. 'David Cameron stands only for a privileged few. Is it any wonder when his most senior colleagues spend so much of their time time currying favour with vested interests?' A Tory spokesman said: 'All donations to the Conservative Party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with Electoral Commission rules.'","Nathan Steinberg bought the ornament at United & Cecil Club gala dinner .

"Thirty-eight years ago a sixth-grade class in Edina, Minnesota, buried a time capsule in front of their elementary school's science room, expecting to find it again one day. But their hopes of digging up old memories decades later proved difficult to realize - when none of them could find the capsule again. The group of classmates came back to Concord Elementary School last weekend, armed with shovels and determined to find what the buried. A little to the left? The former classmates at Concord Elementary School, Endina, Minnesota, couldn't find their old capsule . But despite digging a huge pit outside of the school buildings they remember so well, the 1976 capsule was nowhere to be found, KSTP reported. Enthusiastic diggers milling around the schoolyard were heard saying 'we know it's here somewhere', while digging up an ever-wider section of the grass. They were keen to discover what the capsule holds, as none of them can remember. They were encouraged to stash away their memories of the '70s by their old science teacher, Mr Schweer, who died this year. 'I'm sure it's around here somewhere': One classmate speaks to a news crew about their ill-fated attempt . But eventually the class, now aged around 50, gave up on their search. One digger, Jeff Dunnett, told KARE-11: 'We've really circled it. We really thought we'd find it within a few minutes.' Another added: 'We do know it's here though - because that's the science room and... it's just out here.' A third suggested it may have sunk deeper into the earth. The group reportedly plans to make another attempt soon.","Ex-classmates, now 50, returned to Edina, MN, to dig up capsule from 1976 .

"A globe-trotting benefits cheat has admitted taking a four-month trip to Argentina at the taxpayers' expense. Tracy Johnson, 52, told a jury her flights to Buenos Aires and living costs came out of the benefits she was receiving for being housebound. She Johnson is accused of claiming almost £50,000 in benefits while running a tour company in South America. Globetrotter: Johnson is pictured above at the Salinas Grandes salt flats in Argentina . Salt flats: Johnson is pictured above at another locale in Argentina . Author: The jury was told how Johnson wrote . novels during the period she was making claims, some of which are linked . to the destinations she visited . Johnson, also a published writer, allegedly told the . authorities that she was agoraphobic, suffered from post-traumatic . stress disorder and could hardly walk - while actually indulging in . trips to South America, New York and Madrid. Prosecutor Joanna James asked her: 'Did you benefits pay for a four month trip to Argentina?' Mother-of-one Johnson replied: 'I suppose so.' Johnson claimed she was 'a prisoner of her own home' in Brighton while suffering from agoraphobia brought on by post traumatic stress disorder after witnessing the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers in 2001. But a jury heard she was living in Argentina setting up a travel company called Northwest Nomads taking people on trekking expeditions. Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Johnson also claims to be an actress, dancer, model, DJ, interior designer and a wedding photographer. 'Beneifts cheat': Tracy Johnson, 52, claimed £50,000 while travelling the world. She is pictured at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court . She has also written three books including a novel called The Last Tango in Buenos Aires. Jurors . have been shown images of Johnson on the open salt plains of Argentina, . and were told how she had described relaxing palm tree views from a . hotel in Goa and boasted about expensive spa lunches. However, she later claimed photographs produced as evidence of her travels were 'misleading'. Johnson said: 'We know that blogging and Facebooking is a way you get yourself known in business. 'The photograph from the internet, which the DWP said was from 2012, is actually a photograph taken in 1996.' The court heard Johnson blamed her teenage son Jackson for making bank withdrawals overseas while she was stuck at home in Britain. The court was shown a transaction made in New York the day before a payment was made to a healthfood shop in Wales. Johnson said: 'That would be quite a feat for me to be in New York and then shopping in Builth Wells the next day. It is obvious that my son would go to the States and use my charge card.' She also claims the card was stolen and copied to be used at ATM machines in Argentina. Johnson showed the court a bank statement detailing withdrawals made from an ATM in Argentina on the same day as a cash withdrawal in Llandrindod Wells, Powys, where she was living at the time. Johnson told the court: 'That would need me to be in two places at the same time. 'Someone took my card and was using it at ATM machines in Argentina.' She earlier denied that she had lived a lavish existence, telling jurors: 'If anyone thinks I was living a dream lifestyle for the past few years I want to say that I was not,' she said. It was pretty horrific for the most part.' On the road: In this picture, shown to the jury, a cactus can be seen in the background as Johnson eats at the wheel of a left-hand-drive car . Johnson is accused of living a 'champagne lifestyle' and allegedly spent four months travelling through India, shopping in New York and on a sunshine break in Spain. Prosecutor Joanna James said: 'Tracy Johnson was living the life that honest, decent, hard-working tax payers could only dream of. 'While workers were going out to do their daily grind she was shopping in New York or having a few days in Madrid. It was absolute, blatant dishonesty.' But Johnson claims she was at home suffering from agoraphobia, depression, hallucinations, anxiety, blackouts and post traumatic stress disorder. Johnson, of Frome, Somerset, was arrested after an anonymous tip-off about her alleged worldwide travels. She denies 13 charges of fraud, dishonestly making a false representation and dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances between January, 2008 and July, 2012. The trial continues.

"A German woman has died in a skydiving accident in Arizona where parachutists were attempting to set a world record. The woman, who has not been named, was jumping in Eloy at 7.30am on Thursday when her parachute malfunctioned, Jocelyn Bernatchez, spokeswoman for Skydive Arizona, said. 'The malfunctioning parachute was released too low to allow the reserve parachute to fully open,' she told the Arizona Daily Star. The skydiver was declared dead at the scene. Tragic: A person in the World Team has died while trying to break the world record for a formation jump. Pictured, the Team, a group of 222 skydivers from 28 nations, attempts to break the record on Tuesday . Drop: The woman died after her parachute malfunctioned as she fell through the sky with the other divers (pictured on Tuesday). She was unable to pull her reserve parachute in time . 'It had nothing to do with the size of the group or the aircraft,' World Team spokeswoman Gulcin Gilbert said. 'It was a malfunction of the parachute.' The accident occurred on Thursday during an attempt to break a world record for what is called a 'formation jump'. A group of 220 people from 28 countries free-fall from about 18,000 feet, then come together in a formation before separating and doing another formation before pulling their parachutes. The skydivers jumped at such a high . elevation that they needed oxygen masks in the airplane, and they . hurtled through the air at speeds of more than 100 mph. Attempt: A group of 220 people from about a dozen countries were part of the record attempts this week . Practice: Ahead of the attempts this week, the World Team practiced a dive on the ground, pictured . The group did not complete the formation and therefore did not set the record on Thursday. World Team organized the event at Skydive Arizona, one of the nation's top skydiving locations. Skydivers cried and hugged each other and prayed after they learned of the death. Skydive Arizona in Eloy has been the site of other skydiving deaths in recent months. Two skydivers - from Germany and the United Kingdom - died in November as their parachutes collapsed and they fell to their deaths during an attempt to set a jump record. The previous record was carried out in Florida with 110 people in November 2013, according to Skydive Mag.

"A house that was sold in a state of rank squalor has been cleaned and put back on the market just six months later - for £10,000 more. The filthy three-bedroom semi-detached home in Short Heath Road, Erdington, Birmingham, was sold for £114,950 in March after being advertised on property search website Zoopla. The photos of the house resembled a bombsite, with filthy dishes piled on sinks and counter-tops, floors stained and partially hidden by garbage and mountains of clothes heaped in every room. Scroll down for video . Filth: Dirty dishes, disused mugs and empty containers litter the kitchen in this shocking property advertisement photo which appeared on website Zoopla in February . Slight improvement: A new image which has appeared on property search websites, Zoopla and Rightmove, shows a cleaner kitchen - albeit still needing some work . Despite the shocking pictures, estate agent Burchell Edwards optimistically described the property as a 'period style' house featuring 'Minton tiled flooring' in the vestibule and a 'generous lounge'. The property also boasted a 'family bathroom' and a third bedroom 'bigger than your normal sized third bedroom' as well as being just half-a-mile from Erdington Train Station and local shops. The kitchen diner was described as featuring 'a range of wall and base units incorporating a one-and-a-half bowl stainless steel sink with drainer, integrated appliances to include oven, hob and microwave'. Astonishingly - the property was viewed 14 times by prospective buyers and was on the market for one month before being bought for the full asking price in March. Squalor: The living room was pictured online looking like a bombsite with rubbish piled everywhere - yet the property still attracted a buyer . Clean up: The latest advert shows a tidier living room - the house in Erdington, Birmingham, is now on the market for £125,000 . It was purchased by a property developer who hoped to renovate it and turn it into a luxury family home. But today it emerged that the house was for sale again and, in a sign of the rising housing market, had an asking price of £125,000 - a £10,000 increase in just six months. The buyer, who has not been identified, initially described the house as 'a palace'. But yesterday his love for the property seemed to have waned as updated pictures of the inside of the house looking tidier appeared on the Zoopla website. Grim: The bedroom was originally captured with piles of clothes obscuring the bed and drawers hanging open spilling their contents on to the hidden floor . Empty: The clothes have been taken away but the bedroom is far from welcoming with the door off its hinges and a shoddy-looking cabinet in the middle of the floor . Andy Keogh, of Erdington Estate Agents, said: 'The guy who bought it was a property developer but he only got as far as emptying all the rubbish out and then he ran out of time. 'It's not perfect, it needs a new roof, new windows, new central heating, new everything. It's a massive challenge. 'And someone who likes gardening. Homes that need work get more attention. It needs everything doing, it needs gutting and starting again.' On Zoopla, the latest advertisement confesses: 'The property has featured in The Daily Mail when the property was full of furniture and rubbish (now removed). The property will need a full refurbishment and is on the market due to the new owner not been able to complete the works. 'It would suit someone with plenty of time on their hands and be able to restore the property to a liveable condition. The property is huge inside and should be viewed to appreciate the space on offer either as a family home or multi-room let property.' Original advert: The post appeared on Zoopla in February with estate agent Burchell Edwards optimistically describing the property as a 'period style' house . Fresh on the market: The cleaner property has reappeared online with an asking price of £125,000 - £10,000 more than it was bought for in March .

"Police shifted their search and a northeastern Pennsylvania school district tightened security amid another reported sighting Monday of the suspect in a deadly state police ambush. A local law enforcement official reported seeing suspect Eric Frein near the Swiftwater Post Office in the Pocono Mountains, leading to an intensive police search. Frein, 31, was not captured, Trooper Connie Devens said Monday night, and police are still searching for him more than a month after he shot dead a trooper and seriously injured another. The post office is near Pocono Mountain East High School, Frein's old school. A woman out for a walk on Friday night spotted a rifle-toting man with a mud-covered face at the school. Scroll down for video . Wanted: Eric Frein might have been spotted on Monday, just days after he was seen near his old school Friday. Police released these images showing what Frein could look like after weeks of eluding authorities . On Tuesday morning, police swarmed around a clothing bin, which is used to collect clothing donations, in Swiftwater before moving on. The Pocono Mountain School District also decided to cancel classes for Tuesday - even though officials said on Monday they would remain open. State Police Trooper Tom Kelly explained classes were called off 'as a result of the police activity in the area of the school'. Frein, 31, is charged with opening fire outside the Blooming Grove state police barracks on September 12, killing Pennsylvania State Police Corporal Bryon Dickson and seriously injuring Trooper Alex Douglass. Authorities had been searching for him in the woods around his parents' home in Canadensis but shifted their primary search area five or six miles to the southwest after Friday night's sighting. Lt. Col. George Bivens said over the weekend that police have put a 'tremendous amount of pressure on him' and likely forced him to move. Search: A Pennsylvania State Trooper patrols along a closed section of Lower Swiftwater Road on Saturday as authorities shifted their search area further southwest after Friday night's sighting . Closing in: FBI agents prepare to patrol the woods on Lower Swiftwater Road on Saturday, October 18 . The high school, Frein's alma mater, and all other schools in the Pocono Mountain School District were open Monday but took extra precautions in light of the Friday sighting. Additional officers from the Pocono Mountain Regional Police Department were stationed at the district's Swiftwater campus to supplement the lone police officer who normally patrols that location, which, besides the high school, includes a junior high and elementary school. Pennsylvania State Police did not recommend that schools close, district spokeswoman Wendy Frable said. 'We would not bring the students in if we did not have reassurance from police they felt the campus was safe,' she said Monday morning. Hours later, as police ramped up their search efforts in the area in response to the latest possible sighting, district officials moved outdoor after-school athletic practices to another campus. Attack: Frein, 31, allegedly shot dead Pennsylvania State Police Corporal Bryon Dickson as he stepped outside his barracks on September 12. He then allegedly shot Trooper Alex Douglass, seriously injuring him . State police have said they believe Frein, a self-taught survivalist, has a hatred of law enforcement and wants to target police, not the general public. State police said Monday that blood found at two homes in the search area is not linked to Frein. DNA testing ruled out any link to Frein in blood droplets found on a covered porch in the area. Material found on a back door at a second home near the first turned out not to be human blood. Police believe Frein could be breaking into vacant cabins or vacation homes to look for food or take shelter. The search has put a stop to Barrett Township's Halloween festivities and is also affecting tourism to the area thanks to road blocks and hunting restrictions. Throughout their search, the survivalist has left police clues. Holding on: Frein, pictured right, hates law enforcement and wants to target police, authorities have said . Most recently, Frein's journal was found ditched at a campsite near his home in Canadensis. In the diary, he wrote a chilling description of his cold-blooded sniper attack on the Pennsylvania State Police barracks. 'Friday, September 12, got a shot around 11pm, he dropped. I was surprised at how quick,' the diary reads. 'I took a follow-up shot on his head and neck area. He was still and quiet after that. 'Another cop approached the one I just shot. As he went to kneel, I took a shot at him, one jumped in the door. His legs were visible and still. I ran back to the Jeep.' The diary makes no mention of Frein knowing either trooper or that he was intending to target any individual. Instead, it sets out Frein's desire to kill law enforcement officers and commit mass murder.","Eric Frein has been hiding out in the woods in the Pocono Mountains for more than a month since 'shooting dead a trooper and injuring another'

"Vietnamese police are designing a new Spider Gun-type device to help launch fine fishing nets at errant motorists to snare illegal boy racers on the streets of the northern province of Thanh Hoa. For years officers have launched fine fishing nets into the paths of runaway bikers, causing their wheels to clog up and their bikes to grind to a halt. But today the police force are working on a new weapon - a 'fishnet launcher'. Scroll down for video . Vietnamese police are designing a new Spider Gun-type device to help launch fine fishing nets at errant motorists to snare illegal boy racers on the streets of the northern province of Thanh Hoa . For years officers have launched the nets at the wheels of motorcycles to stop them in their tracks . The new design for a Spider Gun, resembles a standard gun. Vietnamese police say the new weapon should be ready for mass production soon . The nets get caught around the rear wheels, clogging the mechanism and causing the bikes to grind to a halt . The device, which resembles a gun, should be ready for mass production soon. In October 2011 the Thanh Hoa police first used fishing nets, manually throwing them at the rear wheels of drivers flouting the law. But the controversial measure was suspended in March last year, before being revived recently to stop illegal racers over Christmas. Lieutenant Colonel My Duy Xuan, chief of the town traffic police, told Live Leak: 'The new launcher is expected to be more effective in stopping illegal racers driving at any speed.' He said the force plan to continue using the nets, adding that they have also been improved. 'We fold the net and use specialized lead weights to make the flinging easier and more accurate as well as force the bike to decelerate slowly and not in a sudden manner like before,' he said. Officers using the method managed to seize 10 motorbikes on Christmas Eve. A net is pictured wound around the rear wheel of a bike, showing how the fine mesh interferes with the bike's mechanism . A Vietnamese police officer is seen loading the Spider Gun with a cartridge containing a fishing net . Police have denied claims the nets are fired over the heads if motorists, saying they are aimed at the back wheels of the motorcycles . Police stressed the measure is safe and effective. It is understood it will only be used to catch illegal street racers at night. Thanh Hoa police chief Colonel Le Van Nghiem said despite reports, officers do not throw the nets over the heads of riders. He said the force has faced a rise in street racing in the last few years, with youngsters performing tricks on the streets late at night, without helmets for protection. He said many people were too frightened to go out at night after a series of crashes. Between January and March last year, the police seized more than 200 motorbikes after employing the use of the nets.","Vietnamese police cast fishing nets at speeding drivers to snare them .

"Probes sent to Mars usually use a soft landing system that causes them to bounce several times before coming to a standstill. But Nasa needs to be more accurate when it comes to putting humans on the red planet, and it is hoping Space X's Falcon 9 rocket could help. The space agency recently teamed up with Elon Musk's firm to record thermal footage of the Falcon 9 rocket as its first stage pulled away and burned through the atmosphere. Scroll down for video . Nasa recently teamed up with Elon Musk's firm to record thermal footage (left) of the Falcon 9 rocket (pictured left at launch) as its first stage pulled away and burned through the atmosphere . The first stage is the part of the rocket that is ignited at launch and burns through the rocket's ascent until it runs out of propellant. At this point it is discarded from the second stage and returns to Earth. According to Nasa, its descent back to Earth presents Mars-like conditions, which means data collected could help plan a future mission to the red planet. With an failure rate of 66 per cent, the entry, descent and landing phase of the Mars mission is the key part of any mission to the red planet. Mars' surface pressure is less than one per cent of Earth’s, which is not enough to slow down an aircraft from its entry speed of more than 12,000mph (19,000 km/h). The upgraded Falcon 9 v1.1 has engines that are 60 per cent more powerful than previous versions . Private spaceflight company, SpaceX, successfully launched the first of its newly-improved Falcon 9 rockets in September. The nine-engine rocket is its most powerful to date and designed to test the viability of using fully reusable launch vehicles for future missions. Currently, after delivering their payloads into orbit, booster rockets tumble back toward Earth and essentially explode mid-air before crashing into the sea. This is a costly operation causing the price of launches to top £280 million. Space X, however, is attempting to develop rockets that can make soft landings back on Earth so that they can be recovered and recycled. During September's launch, three first-stage engines were reignited, to see if they could bring the first-stage of the rocket segment down through the atmosphere intact. Another engine was then used to try to slow the stage still further just before it touched the water. 'Nestled inside the rocket's new 17-foot (5-metre) diameter nose cone was a small Canadian science satellite called Cassiope that initially was to fly on SpaceX's now-discontinued Falcon 1 . The most revolutionary thing about the new Falcon 9 is the potential ability to recover the boost phase, which is almost three-quarters of the cost of the rocket,' Musk added. The upgraded Falcon 9 v1.1 has engines that are 60 per cent more powerful than previous versions, longer fuel tanks, new avionics and software intended to boost lift capacity and simplify operations for commercial service. To record the descent of Falcon 9, the agency equipped two planes with infrared cameras and had them film the controlled flight which took place in Cape Canaveral in September. On launch day, the planes reached their observation locations about 50 miles (80km) from the projected rocket trajectory. Video footage from the planes revealed the thermal energy given off by the rocket as it fell to Earth at supersonic speeds. 'Because the technologies required to land large payloads on Mars are significantly different than those used here on Earth, investment in these technologies is critical,' said Robert Braun, principal investigator for Nasa Propulsive Descent Technologies (PDT). Mars' surface pressure is less than one per cent of Earth’s, which is not enough to slow down an aircraft from its entry speed of more than 12,000mph (19,000 km/h) 'This is the first high-fidelity data set of a rocket system firing into its direction of travel while traveling at supersonic speeds in Mars-relevant conditions. Nasa chiefs have said that sending a manned mission to Mars is 'necessary if the human race is to survive'. The space agency is currently developing the capabilities needed to capture an asteroid by 2015 and send humans to by 2030. As well as making the daring 34-million-mile journey through space, once at Mars astronauts will have to contend with the cold, barren landscape of Mars. The planet has violent winds with dust storms that engulf the planet for months at a time. It never rains and temperatures drop to -90°C at night.","Footage captured Falcon 9 rocket as its first stage fell back to Earth .

"A Texas elementary school bus driver was caught on camera last week mocking a crying little girl and even inviting the other students to join in. The Floresville driver, who students called Ms. Pat, is not longer employed in the school district after video footage of her cruel and unusual behavior was aired by a local news station.

"A renown costume designer and cosplayer who was in New York for Comic Con is speaking out after she was groped twice over the weekend, once while wearing a poncho. Yaya Han has been dressing up characters from video games, anime and movies for 15 years and is now an internationally recognized personality in cosplaying. Over the weekend, she took to Facebook to reveal that she was groped by people on the street blocks away from the convention. Scroll down for video . In costume: Yaya Han, an internationally known cosplayer who designs costumes and models, says she was groped twice in New York City . 'I know there is a huge percentage of folks out there who believe that female cosplayers often bring unwanted attention onto themselves by the costume and appearance choices they make,' she wrote. 'As in - if you don't want to be disrespected, don't dress that way,' she added. 'I have never agreed with that mindset, but given some of the cleavage-bearing costumes I wear, my opinion usually gets discredited and I'm labeled as a hypocrite.' She describes a stranger grabbing her on the west side of Manhattan. She says she was dressed as a superhero in a black bodysuit, but that she had draped a cape over herself that covered her cleavage. She later spoke with the Daily Dot and described how the person who assaulted her blended into the crowds of the city and how she felt unsafe. 'It’s like you are with hundreds of people right by you, but you’re completely alone in the world and you’re completely lost,' she said. 'You don’t know how to solve the problem.' Worse, it happened again the very next day when she was walking back from a musical on Broadway, this time while she was wearing a head-to-toe poncho. Player: Han is one of a few people in the world earning a significant income from cosplaying, though she says she still designs costumes of her own for fun . Superhero: Han spoke up after she was groped while wearing a superhero costume on the streets of New York, saying she was covering her cleavage with a cape . Targeted: Han says she wants people to stop targeting women and saying they 'deserve' assault because they're showing skin . 'No cleavage, not even any shape showing. Tonight's groper actually missed my bikini area because of the poncho,' she wrote on Facebook. Han says that conventions have actually changed in recent years to provide safe spaces for people to dress up without fear of harassment, though when she shares stories like hers, not all of her fans seem to want to listen. Han said that after she shared a video of Anita Sarkeesian, a critic of sexualized violence and objectification in video games who has been the target of death threats, to Facebook, she immediately lost almost 1,000 followers. 'All that hate,' Han said. 'You don’t deserve death threats, to have violence threatened against you… I don’t care what these women did, you don’t treat human beings that say.'","Yaya Han says she was wearing a superhero costume the first time someone grabbed at her body .

"The United States may be the mightiest military and economic power in the world but when it comes to shuttling its top diplomat around the globe, it's beginning to look like a poor orphan. For the fourth time this year — and the second time in three months, Secretary of State John Kerry was forced to fly home commercially when his aging Air Force Boeing 757, known in military parlance as a C-32, was grounded on Thursday with a mechanical problem in Vienna. Inconvenient? Undoubtedly.  Kerry, heading back to Washington from nuclear talks with senior European and Iranian officials, made light of the situation, telling aides: 'If the hardest thing that happens in a given day is that you have to fly commercial, your life is pretty good.' Takeoff:  Secretary of State John Kerry waves as he boards his plane to Vienna - and on his return trip he was forced to fly commercial . Landing: Kerry met Wednesday in Vienna with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to try and advance nuclear talks and meet the target date of November 24 . Embarrassing? Perhaps. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif chuckled when he learned of Kerry's predicament. 'So it is not just our planes,' Zarif said. Iran hasn't been able to refurbish its pre-1979 fleet of Boeing aircraft because of heavy U.S. sanctions. But trivial? Not so much. Officials say far more than appearance is at stake, particularly in the midst of multiple world crises like Ebola, the military campaign against Islamic State militants, the crisis in Ukraine, Israeli-Palestinian relations and, yes, the Iran nuclear talks. Without access to the secure phone links and classified data on his own plane, Kerry was effectively out of the loop during the nine-hour flight from Vienna to Washington.  Aides said he had to cancel or reschedule several calls with world leaders and other members of President Barack Obama's national security team. 'In the world we live in, we do high-stakes diplomacy via phone and secure phone,' said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. 'None of that is possible when any secretary of state is flying on a commercial plane without secure communications with hundreds of people.' 'Every minute of their day is scheduled,' she said. 'There is not a single flight where Secretary Kerry isn't calling in via secure phone to an interagency meeting or receiving sensitive national security information, or reading classified information or briefings.' And he flies a lot. Frequent flier: Before his current trip, Kerry had logged more than 566,000 plane miles this year alone, according to the State Department . Greetings: At the airport Kerry spoke with Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz . Before his current trip, Kerry had logged more than 566,000 plane miles this year alone, according to the State Department. That's nearly 1,220 hours or more than 50 days in the air. Problems with the 1990s-era Air Force fleet that ferry America's top officials aren't new, and secretaries of state have long complained about the aircraft they must fly for official business. Some have joked about being envious of colleagues with newer, more efficient and more luxurious planes. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton encountered several aviation breakdowns when she was in office, including a tire that burst on landing in the United Arab Emirates, leading to an unscheduled overnight stay in Dubai. But she never had to resort to flying commercially. Yet the problems seem to be becoming more frequent and more serious. Thursday's incident was the fourth with one of Kerry's planes this year. The previous two — in Switzerland in January and in Britain in March — were resolved with only minor delays to his schedule. But in August, an electronics issue forced Kerry to return to Washington from Hawaii on a commercial flight at the end of a round-the-world diplomatic mission. On Thursday, the crew discovered that an auxiliary fuel tank was leaking. An Associated Press reporter who visited the aircraft found the cabin full of fumes. And, one technician involved in trying to patch up the leak complained of feeling ill.","For the fourth time this year — and the second time in three months, Secretary of State John Kerry was forced to fly home commercially when his plane was grounded .

"In just a decade, the caterpillar of the horse chestnut leaf-mining moth has munched its way across most of England and Wales, turning leaves brown months early and shrinking conkers. Scientists say there is no way of controlling the tiny but insatiable pest – and we will have to get used to seeing fewer horse chestnut trees. The warning follows a project in which thousands of ‘citizen scientists’, including schoolchildren, helped researchers monitor the moth’s march. The leaf-miner moth has eaten its way through greenery in most parts of England and Wales in the past decade . Information from the volunteers showed that the Greek invader has spread to most of England and Wales since first being spotted in Wimbledon, south west London, in 2002. The caterpillars, which are no bigger than a grain of rice, burrow through the leaves of conker trees, causing them to turn brown and autumnal in appearance, even in the height of summer. Although this doesn’t kill the horse chestnut outright, there are fears about the long-term health of the trees which can live for several hundred years. It is already known that the average conker has shrunk in size from 1.25 inches in diameter to just one inch. One of the keys the pest’s success is the speed at which it breeds. Within just one summer, a single female can give rise to 5,000 moths, and a tree will appear to shimmer with activity as the young emerge from their silken cocoons. The citizen science project, reported in the journal PLoS ONE (MUST CREDIT), also revealed that it takes just three years from the first moth arriving in an area for the majority of horse chestnuts to turn brown before their time. Michael Pocock, of the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology in Oxfordshire, said: ‘It looks like autumn has come early. Scientists say there is no way to stop the pest which turns leaves brown months early and shrinks conkers . ‘They are going brown in August, rather than in November.’ Experiments done by the volunteers showed that although Britain does have parasitic wasps that prey on the caterpillars, there are not enough to them to keep the pests under control. Dr Pocock said that ultimately, the disease could cause horse chestnuts to disappear. This is because as the trees die from other causes, they are being replaced with other species because people don’t want to see ugly, brown pitted leaves. The moth, which was first spotted in Macedonia, northern Greece in the 1970s, is a poor flier and is thought to hitch lifts on cars and lorries. Dr Pocock, who worked with Hull University on the study, said: ‘There has been quite a lot of research money spent and scientists have had to say there is nothing that can be done to stop its spread. ‘Although, what is interesting is that it got to Newcastle in 2011 and doesn’t seem to have got any further north – I was expecting it to get to Scotland about two years ago. It hasn’t yet and I’m intrigued.’","The horse chestnut leaf-mining moth has spread across England and Wales .

"A Cornell study has discovered an uncomfortable truth about children's cereal and it's not their sky-high sugar content: it's the hypnotic eyes of their cartoon mascots. While the people on adult cereals look straight ahead, the researchers noticed that cartoon tigers, frogs, Cap'ns and the like tend to stare downward. That allows them to gaze right into the eyes of their intended consumer, your kids--a finding that makes sense since they also discovered that eye contact increase brand trust by 16 percent. Scroll down for video... Here's looking at you! Cornell researchers have discovered that kids' cereal cartoon characters stare down at children at an average angle of 9.67 degrees . Cornell Food and Brand Lab Researchers Aner Tal and Brian Wansink evaluated 85 different characters at 10 grocery stores in New York and Connecticut for their project dubbed Cereal Box Psychology. Grocers have long been known to place the kids stuff on lower shelves. But even those shelves can be above many kids' heads. To make up for that, the researchers found that characters like Cap'n Crunch, Tony the Tiger, Luck the Leprechaun and company look downward at an average angle of 9.67 degrees. Meanwhile, cereal for adults--Which is placed an average of 48 inches off the ground versus the children's 23 inches--tends to feature people looking straight ahead. 'Why is Cap'n Crunch looking down at my child?': The Cereal Box Psychology study came from the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab and looked at 85 characters on cereal boxes in 10 stores in New York and Connecticut . Friends: Meanwhile, the study found that people on adult cereal boxes tend to stare directly ahead, presumably into the eyes of their intended consumers, since the adult cereals are placed higher up . Coming back for more: The researchers also found that eye contact from characters increases 'brand trust' by 16 percent . The reason for those googly eyes is more than simply aesthetic. The researchers showed one version of the Trix rabbit that made eye contact and one that did not to to 63 college students. They found 'that brand trust was 16 percent higher and the feeling of connection to the brand was 10 percent higher when the rabbit made eye contact.' 'If you are a cereal company looking to market healthy cereals to kids, use spokes-characters that make eye contact with children to create brand loyalty,""' Wansink said. And what of sugar conscious parents who can't bear the thought of their children being hypnotized into eating these tempting products? 'If you are a parent who does not want your kids to go ""cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs,""' he said, 'avoid taking them down the cereal aisle.'","Cornell researchers have discovered that children's cereal characters stare down toward kids' eyes at a 9.67 degree angle .

"Army veteran: John Campbell, who served in the Second World War and died without any surviving relatives, had a send-off befitting his heroism after 500 people attended his funeral following an appeal by the Royal British Legion . A 92-year-old army veteran who served in the Second World War and died without any surviving relatives has been given an emotional send off by hundreds of well-wishers. It was feared that no-one would attend the funeral of John Campbell who served with the British Army until 1951 and was acting Major in Burma during the Second World War. However after an appeal by the Royal British Legion, around 500 members of the public arrived at Whitley Bay Crematorium in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, to pay their respects. Mr Campbell served with the Cameron Highlanders and was awarded the Military Cross for his gallantry. He was badly injured when battling the Japanese and lost an eye. His hearing was also permanently damaged and he needed surgery on his face. He passed away at North Tyneside General Hospital on March 17, following a four-year stay at Fontburn Court in North Shields, North Tyneside. Standard bearers, from the Royal British Legion, stood either side of the road as the hearse went into the crematorium. John Cusack, manager of Fontburn Court, was one of the people attending the funeral this afternoon. He enjoyed regular chats with the former soldier during his time at the sheltered accommodation. Mr Cusack said: 'He was a very nice man, he was quite a gentleman. He would ask people how they were and he was always kind and thoughtful towards the staff here. 'He was quite a character and he had a great sense of humour. 'He was a very talkative person, he would start by talking about this army career then he would be talking about something completely different.' Respect, and thanks: Around 500 members of the public arrived at Whitley Bay Crematorium in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, to pay their respects this afternoon . An example: As well as being a decorated soldier, Mr Campbell was described as a 'gentleman' who loved chatting with people . Mr Campbell served with the Cameron Highlanders and was awarded the Military Cross for his gallantry . He added: 'Being in the army meant he had a routine everyday. He always wanted his boiled eggs or his porridge made the same way. 'Being a soldier in the past deserves respect but regardless of his army career, everybody deserves the respect of having somebody at their funeral and that’s why our members of staff were there. 'A nice man deserves a good send off. I am sure there were people here who wanted to get in contact with him but didn’t realise he was still alive.' Mr Cusack believes Mr Campbell to have been married and discovered he was born in 1921. Brotherhood: Representatives of numerous veteran organisations turned out to pay their respects . One attendee said: 'To see a veteran go to the grave with no recognition at all is wrong. I have taken the afternoon off work to pay my respects to a veteran who deserves it' Paul Adams, Durham county Rep for the Royal British Legion Bikers Branch, said: 'To see a veteran go to the grave with no recognition at all is wrong. 'I have taken the afternoon off work to pay my respects to a veteran who deserves it. 'I have never met him but I know from his campaign he had a very hard time. We have short memories and these people often get forgotten about as they get older.

"They are usually portrayed as mortal enemies on screen. But this cat cannot hold a grudge against dogs - after he received a blood transfusion from one. Buttercup the tabby was in desperate need of a transfusion after collapsing at his home in Key West in Monroe County, Florida, last month. Rare procedure: Buttercup the tabby is pictured receiving a blood transfusion from a dog after collapsing at his home in Key West in Monroe County, Florida, last month. Incredibly, he has since made a full recovery . He was rushed to Marathon Veterinary Hospital (MVH), where he was diagnosed with anemia, with a red blood cell count of just seven per cent, far lower than the minimum of 35 for a healthy feline. But despite his life-threatening condition, vets told his owner Ernie Saunders it would take too long to find him an exact feline blood donor. Instead, they decided to perform an extremely rare procedure - called a xenotransfusion - using blood from a West Palm Beach dog blood bank. Dr Sean Perry, who performed the operation on Buttercup at MVH, told the Miami Herald: 'Cat's blood is a little harder to come by and not as available as dog's blood. Saved: The tabby underwent an extremely rare operation, called a xenotransfusion, which uses a dog's blood . Amazing: The complex surgery was performed by Dr Sean Perry (left) at Marathon Veterinary Hospital (right) ""You can't give type A blood to a type B blood cat because it'll cause a severe immune reaction. It was actually safer to give the cat dog's blood. It is a very rare procedure.' He added: 'We had greyhound blood packs that we get from a blood bank that has red blood cells separated from plasma. Buttercup showed no signs of rejection during the transfusion.' The four-hour procedure has been carried out on just 62 cats in the U.S, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Mr Saunders, who also discovered Buttercup was actually a male - not a female, as he had previously thought - during the surgery, said his pet has since made a full recovery.

"Alleged victims of paedophile priest Father Brendan Smyth (above ) are among those expected to give evidence to the inquiry . Sexual abuse was rampant at a children's home in Northern Ireland run by a Catholic order of brothers, a former senior policeman has said. Around a fifth of boys at Rubane House in Co Down were subjected to sexual or physical abuse, according to a public inquiry, equal to if not worse than that at another notorious home, Kincora in east Belfast. Rubane was the subject of a police investigation in the 1990s, the Historical Institutional Abuse inquiry was told. Three De La Salle Order brothers were charged but none convicted after their trials did not go ahead due to legal issues. Former Royal Ulster Constabulary Detective Chief Superintendent Eric Anderson wrote a note to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) that read: 'Sexual abuse by a considerable number of the De La Salle brothers on the children and consequently between children is rampant.' Most offenders were already dead or medically certified unfit for trial. Mr Anderson added: 'The full horror of the abuse in this establishment is reflected in 41 files already submitted through your office to the DPP. 'I consider the complaints made to show it to be on a par with, if not worse than, the abuse at the Kincora children's home.' Kincora was the subject of a high-profile child abuse scandal in the 1980s. Three senior care staff at Kincora were jailed in 1981 for abusing 11 boys in their care. It is chaired by former High Court judge Sir Anthony Hart (above)  and investigating what took place at 13 residential children's homes run by religious orders, voluntary organisations and the state . From 1951 until 1985 around 1,000 children stayed at Rubane, near Kircubbin on the Ards Peninsula. Abuse of around a fifth of residents ranged from watching boys in the showers for sexual gratification to rape or physical attacks, lawyer for the inquiry Joseph Aiken said. The probe was established by Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont and is sitting in Banbridge in Co Down. It is chaired by former High Court judge Sir Anthony Hart and investigating what took place at 13 residential children's homes run by religious orders, voluntary organisations and the state in the 73-year period up to 1995. The probe was established by Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont (above) and is sitting in Banbridge in County Down . Around 200 former residents made abuse allegations about Rubane, 55 have come forward to the inquiry and the majority are expected to give evidence. Lawyers are to examine 40,000 documents. Alleged victims of paedophile priest Father Brendan Smyth are among those expected to give evidence. Mr Aiken said: 'A police investigation into Smyth in the early 1990s revealed that he had also abused children in both Rubane and Nazareth Lodge [in Belfast]  in the late 1970s. 'He, as we will see, admitted much of that abuse and was convicted for it.' Alleged abuse at Rubane dated back to the 1950s and extended more widely than Fr Smyth. In the 1950s a brother in overall charge, now dead, engaged in a 20-year litany of attacks, the barrister said. Former Detective Chief Superintendant Eric Anderson (left) with his Southern counterpart, Assistant Garda Commissioner Kevin Cartey. It was DCS Anderson who identified the 'rampant' abuse . The Order now accepts that this overseer did sexually abuse children in his care before, during and after his time in Rubane, which spanned some nine years alone, the inquiry was told. The brother was never reported to police or interviewed. In 1969 allegations were made against another brother who admitted his guilt and left the Order. Another member of the congregation was moved from the home in 1972 because of claims of sex abuse, Mr Aiken said. A police investigation after boys complained to social workers in the late 1970s saw two individuals convicted. In 2010 the Police Service of Northern Ireland began investigating abuse. Mr Aiken said: 'Police are looking again at many allegations previously investigated but also at fresh allegations not made during those inquiries.' The Order has in recent years dealt with more than 50 civil claims brought by former residents; 22 have been resolved. The Order has paid out almost £390,000 in compensation. Mr Aiken said: 'The oral evidence over the coming weeks will continue to be extremely harrowing and difficult to hear, however, individuals have come forward to the inquiry with the desire, however difficult it may be for them, and want the opportunity to publicly explain what happened to them when they were supposed to have been in the care of the [Catholic] Diocese of Down and Connor and the De La Salle Order.' Three senior care staff at Kincora (above) were jailed in 1981 for abusing 11 boys in their care . Rubane was a voluntary children's home for boys aged between 11 and 16 but increasingly from the 1970s it accepted children from the welfare authorities, predominantly from deprived parts of Belfast. Some of the boys were 'educationally sub-normal', according to official documents read out during the inquiry. It had a very successful farm, generating income for the home, Mr Aiken said. Children had access to medical professionals and recreational facilities like a swimming pool. Concerns were expressed by inspectors n the 1950s about overcrowding, inadequate staff numbers and the institutional and regimented approach to child care. Mr Aiken said there were fundamental failures in the characteristics of some of the brothers recruited to work at the home which made them unsuitable to be around children. He said there could be no justification for the sexual and physical abuse of boys or for failing to properly deal with it when it came to light or for covering it up. Many boys also made allegations against civilian staff. One complained about somebody who lived near the home who allegedly abused boys in the considerable wooded grounds. The lawyer added some children were hospitalised for physical assaults causing injuries which could not have resulted from lawful corporal punishment. The inquiry is expected to begin hearing evidence next month.","From 1951 to 1985 around 1,000 children stayed at Rubane, near Kircubbin on the Ards Peninsula .

"No-one it seems, is too elite to take a leaf out of Kate Middleton's style book when an important occasion calls, and that includes Chelsea Clinton, America's former first daughter. For when Chelsea emerged from Manhattan's Lenox Hill hospital yesterday evening cradling three-day-old baby Charlotte, she was dressed in near-identical attire to that worn by Kate last year when she first left St. Mary's Hospital in London with Prince George, now 14 months old. Chelsea's pale printed cornflower-blue dress, cut just above the knee, was slightly looser than the one worn by Kate, and she sported a fresh blowout - albeit a slightly less immaculate one than Kate's. All in all, however, the look was the same: fresh, modest, new-motherly. Spotted again! Chelsea Clinton left hospital with three-day-old baby Charlotte yesterday evening (left), opting for almost the same outfit as that worn by Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, when she left hospital with Prince George last July (right) Chelsea descended the steps of the hospital with little Charlotte wrapped in white swaddling, sporting a pair of low-heeled wedges - just like Kate did - flanked by her adoring husband, Marc Mezvinsky. Marc, an investment banker, made like Prince William, both first-time fathers, and stood protectively just behind his wife, letting she and baby Charlotte take center stage. He went one further in the public affection stakes, however, when he delivered a quick kiss to the top of Chelsea's head for all the world to see. Charlotte, whose birth-weight hasn't been released, was a surprise to Chelsea and Marc, who choose not to find out the sex of their unborn child. Kate and William on the other hand, knew they were expecting a boy, George, who weighed in at 8lb 6oz. Royal blue: Chelsea, America's former first daughter, had clearly treated herself to a post-birth blowout (left), much the same - if a little less coiffed - than Kate's last year (right) - and both wore low-heeled wedges . Eagerly awaited: Baby Charlotte's (left) birth-weight has not been revealed and her sex was kept as a surprise for her parents. George (right) weighed in at 8lb 6oz and Kate and William knew he would be a boy . Chelsea had the iron-clad support of her parents, former US president Bill Clinton and Senator Hilary Clinton, who accompanied the new couple out of the hospital. Kate's nor William's parents were present on the hospital steps for their big reveal. Kate, now pregnant with her second child, won widespread praise for choosing the dress she did for George's unveiling last July - a custom-made Jenny Packham polka dot number - which made no attempts to hide her post-birth mummy tummy. In fact, it made a show of it. Chelsea, whose looser dress swamped her curves, gave birth at 7.03pm Friday night, and announced the news a few hours later. Doting dads: Chelsea's husband Marc Mezvinsky planted an adoring kiss on his wife's head (left) while Prince William was clearly smitten too, if a little more reserved with his public display (right) Rabbit in the headlights: Both Marc (left) and William (right) appeared somewhat overcome by their new-found fatherhood and the media circus surrounding them . Details surrounding the actual birth have not yet emerged, but Chelsea stayed in the hospital for a full three days before checking out. Kate, who left the hospital only one day after giving birth, later described her own 11-hour labor as 'perfect.' An insider told Vanity Fair last year: '[Kate] said it was straightforward and there were no complications. She wanted a natural birth and she was so happy she was able to have one.'

The shoes: Royal blue suede low-heeled wedges with rounded toes . The hair: An almost-straight blowout, left with a natural kink . The make-up: Minimal, with just a faint hint of lipstick . Demeanor: Beaming with unrestrained pride, joy and excitement . The dress: Cornflower-blue polka dot empire-line design with short sleeves, cut just above the knee, custom-made by Jenny Packham . The shoes: Cream low-heeled sandal wedges with rounded toes . The hair: Kate's trademark blowout; sleek and finished with loose waves . The make-up: Polished, with groomed brows, blush and a hint of eyeliner . Demeanor:Glowing,elegant but evidently tired and a little nervous . Bill and Hillary met their granddaughter for the first time on Saturday, and shared photographs of them cooing over the baby, declaring themselves 'over the moon'. Moments before, Chelsea had shared the first picture of her daughter, which shows her cradling the baby next to her husband. The couple, who married in July 2010, announced in April that they were expecting their first child. Mummy tummy: Kate won widespread praise for the custom-made Jenny Packham dress she wore for her big moment, as it accentuated - rather than hid - her post-birth stomach (right) and Chelsea wasn't hiding hers either (left) Precious cargo: Hands-on William packed his new son George into a black SUV and drove his new family away from the hospital himself . Duties: Hilary and Bill arrive at Chelsea's Manhattan apartment shortly after they leave hospital to settle baby Charlotte into her new home . Bill and Hillary had been publicly gushing for months at the prospect of becoming grandparents, though Chelsea's exact due date had been kept quiet. In a recent TV interview, former President Bill said: 'I hope by the first of October, I'll be a grandfather.' Happily for him, his wish was granted. Gushing grandparents: The Clintons have made no secret of their longing for a grandchild - and posted this picture in celebration when Charlotte was born . 'We are in love': Chelsea posted this picture of her holding Charlotte with husband and new father Marc shortly after the birth . Last week, Hillary also excited fans as she told a crowd at political steak fry in Indianola, Iowa: 'Bill and I are on constant grandchild watch. So don't be surprised if we suddenly go sprinting off the stage. 'I want to babysit any chance I get,' she added. When Chelsea announced her pregnancy during a Clinton Foundation event devoted to empowering young women, she told guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year. Luxurious: The Manhattan-based Lenox Hill hospital suite Chelsea chose for her birth offers huge, well-appointed rooms such as this  (pictured) Royal chambers: Kate opted for a room similar to this one (pictured) in the private Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in London, where Princes William and Harry were born decades before . Hilary added: 'I certainly feel all the better whether it's a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in world filled with so many strong, young female leaders. 'I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.' Kate's carefully staged-managed outfit for the day she introduces the world to the second royal baby next year remains to be seen. Chances are that, when that day comes, Chelsea will be watching closely.","Baby Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky was born at 7.03pm Friday September 26, and her birth-weight has not been revealed .

"Game of Thrones fans were promised cheaper access to the show by Foxtel but the hit drama is not included in the new subscription deal to win over more customers and reduce illegal downloads. Connecting to Pay TV network now starts at $25 per month, which includes more than 40 channels. however - there is an additional cost to gain access to sports, dramas and movies. The subscription giant has also set up a new channel, Box Sets, which screens entire seasons, back-to-back, of some of the most popular TV series including the blockbuster. Scroll down for video . Game of Thrones fans were promised cheaper access to the show by Foxtel but the hit drama is not included in the new subscription deal to win over more customers and reduce illegal downloads . Foxtel customers now pay $45 instead of $74 to access drama, sport and movies . However, the minimum cost to buy into a pay-TV package which will deliver Game Of Thrones at the same time as it airs in the US along with a host of HBO quality shows is $45. Previously it would have cost viewers a minimum of $74 to access the series. However, considering Australians set a world record for file sharing downloads - with more than one million  accessing the show last season - the question begs is the reduced subscription enough to stop fans from illegally downloading? According to file sharing monitor TorrentFreak, Australia is the only country in the world to reach double digit downloads of the show with 11.6 per cent of GoT downloads originating here. Despite the show being a massive success - Foxtel only managed to hit the 115,000-175,000 viewers range - technically fewer viewers than for Peppa Pig on Sunday mornings. Making Game Of Thrones cheaper to watch is not the sole reason behind Foxtel's revised pricing structure but it is the reference point for comparing the old subscription scale to the new one. Foxtel CEO Richard Freudenstein said there has already been a positive response to their new pay structure. There will also be more HD channels and the launch of an upgraded IQ box to allow viewers to watch shows that have been screened in the previous 24 hours. More than one million Australians downloaded the last season of GoT - more than any other country .","Foxtel promised Game of Thrones fans cheaper access to the show .

"Four in ten children lack the basic skills needed to be ready for school at the age of five, new figures revealed yesterday. More than 250,000 youngsters struggle with the demands of formal education after falling short of development targets in early reading, writing and physical skills. Boys have fallen significantly behind girls by the age of five, with only 52 per cent considered to have reached a ‘good level of development’. Scroll down for video . More than 250,000 youngsters struggle with the demands of formal education after falling short of development targets in early reading, writing and physical skills (picture posed by models) Girls are racing ahead in every area of early development measured by the Government, with 69 per cent judged to be ready to start formal schooling. The figures – based on assessments of children at the end of their primary school reception year - prompted ministers to insist that nurseries and other carers ‘must do more’ to help toddlers learn. Despite improvements in most parts of the country since last year, Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah insisted that ‘too few young children are ready for school’. The figures show that just 59 per cent of boys can write a simple sentence or a letter to Father Christmas at the age of five against three-quarters of girls. Just 68 per cent of boys can read simple sentences compared with 80 per cent of their female classmates. Commenting on the figures, Mr Gyimah said: ‘We know the first few years of a child’s life can be make or break in terms of how well they go on to do at school and beyond. ‘The statistics published today clearly show that some progress is being made but more must be done to ensure children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are put on the right path. ‘Parents need to be confident that while their children are out of their care, they’re not only safe, happy and having fun but at the same time developing important skills like playing confidently with their friends, speaking and understanding words, letters and numbers. ‘The Government has provided new funding through the Early Years Pupil Premium and strengthened qualifications to raise standards. It’s now up to those who support our children to ensure they get the start in life they deserve – something parents and I both want to see.’ The figures – based on assessments of children at the end of their primary school reception year - prompted ministers to insist that nurseries and other carers ‘must do more’ to help toddlers learn . Under a ‘nappy curriculum’ for children aged from birth to five, teachers observe youngsters in their care and judge how well they are doing against 17 scales. They are judged to have reached a ‘good level of development’ if they can show they are attentive in class, can follow detailed instructions, use tenses when speaking and show good control and co-ordination when making large and small movements. They must also use the toilet and dress independently, be confident to try new activities, know that some behaviour is unacceptable and take turns with others when playing. In literacy and numeracy, they should be able to read and write simple sentences, count to 20 and use everyday language to talk about size and weight. The curriculum is meant to prepare youngsters to start compulsory schooling at age five and is followed by primary school reception classes, nurseries and childminders. But some critics have claimed that formal learning is being imposed on children too soon. There are particular concerns that the education system is failing to properly cater for boys, for example through shortages of male teachers. Yesterday’s figures – from the Department for Education - show 60 per cent of five-year-olds were judged to have reached a ‘good’ levels of development this summer - up from 52 per cent last year. It means some 258,000 youngsters will start Year One lacking some of the skills needed to cope with the demands of schooling. While boys narrowed the gap slightly in some areas, they still lagged behind girls, particularly in reading and writing. Courtesy of Australia National University . Professor Sir Michael Marmot, director of University College London’s Institute of Health Equity , said the quality of parenting and the amount of time adults spent interacting with children was critical to their development . The narrowest gap was in the use of technology, where 91 per cent of girls had a good level of understanding, against 89 per cent of boys. Researchers from University College London’s Institute of Health Equity warned last month that too many children were being left damaged by early parenting which lacked cuddles and conversation. Britain had some of the worst levels of development among children in the western world, it was claimed. Professor Sir Michael Marmot, director of the institute, said the quality of parenting and the amount of time adults spent interacting with children was critical to their development. ‘Of course, some children will do better than others because it’s in their genes or things of that nature but we know the quality of parenting is crucial,’ he said. ‘We know input from parents or other carers on talking to children or reading to children, playing with children, singing with children and warmth - emotion, cuddling, loving - are all vital to children’s development.’ He said poor performance was also closely linked to levels of deprivation and the quality of services to support children and their parents before they start school. Commenting on the latest figures, Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, representing thousands of early years providers, said: ‘We are extremely disappointed that the minister has used these results, which show a marked improvement in outcomes across all areas of development, to direct unfair criticism at the early years sector. ‘Childcare professionals continue to do remarkable work in the face of inadequate funding and extremely limited practical support. Recent sector initiatives rolled-out by the Department for Education – such as the early years pupil premium – while positive in theory, will do little to address these challenges in practice, largely because the government refuses to acknowledge the severity of the current problem.’","Figures were based on assessments of children at end of reception year .
