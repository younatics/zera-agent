"By . Sam Webb . Thief: Amanda Mann, an estate agent lettings manager, denied 17 charges of theft involving £7,500. She spent some of the cash on breast reduction surgery and designer shoes . A woman who stole from her employers and spent some of the cash on breast reduction surgery and designer shoes has been jailed for two years and three months this morning. Amanda Mann, an estate agent lettings manager, of Rhuddlan, near Rhyl, Wales, denied 17 charges of theft involving £7,500 but was previously convicted by a jury. The prosecution alleged that she had been responsible for stealing a far larger amount - in the region of £90,000. The judge, Mr Recorder Timothy Petts, told her today that he was convinced that she had stolen more than the amount in the charges, but it was impossible to say how much. The trial heard how Mann, 43, spent money on Jimmy Choo shoes and on breast reduction surgery at a cost of £6,000. Mold Crown Court was told today that she still denied any thefts, protested her innocence, and blamed others for taking the money. Mann worked for Fletcher and Poole estate agents at Conwy and was promoted to lettings manageress ten years ago. Most tenants paid in cash and Mann dealt with banking. She’d been regarded as a friend by her employer but there had been 'systematic siphoning off of money' which should have gone to the company. Application fees paid by tenants had been stolen, commission fees paid by landlords hadn’t been passed on, and deposit payments had also vanished. Mann had been suspended then sacked in 2011 and police called in. Bank statements showed Mann had £17,000 debts but periodically deposited large sums of cash. She had lived in a flat above the office and paid £300-a-month rent in cash. Owen Edwards, defending, said that his client had settled a £5,000 personal injury claim which could be used for compensation and said if she was allowed her liberty more money could be paid over from her earnings. He suggested that the inevitable prison sentence could be suspended because his client, a woman of good character, suffered from depression. There had also been huge delays in the case being dealt with, he added. Fletcher and Poole Estate Agents, where Mann was the lettings manager. The thefts took place over three-and-a-half years . But Mr Recorder Timothy Petts told Mann that it had to be immediate custody. He said that it was a small, family-run, friendly firm where everyone was trusted in the handling of cash. 'Over a period of time you systematically abused that trust and treated cash receipts as your own,' he said. It was a breach of 'a high degree of trust' where she was the manager, it went on over a three and a half year period, when she 'systematically and deliberately' stole from her employer. It was only brought to an end when she was caught. She had tried to cover her tracks and disguise what was happening and blamed others by making 'wild allegations' which were entirely false. The offences had caused considerable damage to the business and its reputation and her thieving continued when others were being made redundant and when the owner was undergoing cancer treatment, he said. 'This was a considerable period of thieving. Only immediate custody is appropriate,' he said.","Amanda Mann may have stolen up to £90,000, a court heard .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . University of New Mexico law student Jeremy Martin says that an overzealous police officer kneed him in the groin so viciously during a routine traffic stop that he lost a testicle. Martin, 24, was driving a carload of friends after midnight on Friday when a police officer pulled him over claiming he ran a stop sign. A police report filed by an officer Padilla claimed that Martin appeared to be intoxicated and admitted to having three beers. Law student Jeremy Martin claims an Albuquerque police officer kneed him so hard in the groin during a traffic stop his shattered testicle had to be removed . Martin went through a series of field sobriety tests then the officer asked him to sit on the curb. However, according to the report, Martin resisted. Martin's attorney, Sam Bregman, told KOB4 that the officer reacted in the worst possible way. 'This officer felt the necessity to knee him so . directly and with so much blunt force that it shattered his testicle,' he said. Martin was booked on misdemeanor charges of marijuana possession and DWI. His face is visibly injured in his mug shot, and while the police report mentions those injuries it does not mention his testicle. 'He was taken to Presbyterian Hospital where he had emergency surgery to have his testicle removed,' Bregman said. Bregman is now filing suit against the officers involved.

'How does a DWI investigation with a first year law . student -- when he absolutely did nothing to provoke the officer -- . result in the shattering of his testicle and emergency surgery to remove . it?' Bregman asked. In Bregman's favor is that the police report contains several inconsistencies. Besides omitting the testicle injury, the report claims Bregman went through a stop sign while traveling north on Wellesley Place, but it's impossible to travel north on that street and reach the stop sign in question.","University of New Mexico student Jeremy Martin was stopped Friday when an officer claims he ran a stop sign .

Crisp packets from Golden Wonder ready salted and salt and vinegar varieties dating back to the 1960s were among the rubbish plucked from the sand, with their colouful packaging barely faded.

"By . Wills Robinson . A serial burglar who stole money a mother-of-two had been saving for a holiday has avoided prison weeks after vigilantes who kidnapped him in a bid to retrieve the cash were jailed. Michael Price-Rutherford took £280 from Kelly Hilton, 32, who had saved the cash for a trip to Lanzarote when he broke into her home in Blackburn, Lancashire. A short time later, the 22-year-old was then bundled into a van by her boyfriend and another man, punched in the face and humiliated in an act of revenge. He was eventually dumped half naked and crying in the road nursing a chipped tooth after being held prisoner by Daniel Finn, 27, and Daniel Howarth, 23, for five hours. Avoided jail: Michael Price Rutherford (left)  walked free from Preston Crown Court, Lancashire, after receiving a suspended sentenced for stealing money mother-of-two Kerry Hilton (right) had been saving for a holiday . The two men were jailed for a total of five years in March after a judge said they had 'crossed the law'. However Price-Rutherford escaped with a suspended sentence, despite having 12 convictions to his name, claiming he was a 'shy un-forceful character'. Preston Crown Court in Lancashire heard he had been on bail for another break in at the time, and had ignored previous curfew orders. But the defence said he was 'put up to the crime' by other people, and only acted as a look out. After the sentencing Miss . Hilton, a golf club waitress said: 'I can’t believe this lad has escaped . jail after what he did. I’m just shocked and upset. 'I . was due to go to Lanzarote with my parents, Danny and family and had . been saving up for months. 'The tin was hidden behind my bed and I was . also collecting coins for the trip. All of it went in the raid. Vigilantes: In March, Daniel Finn, 27, and Daniel Howarth, 23, were jailed for a total of five years following the act of revenge where they bundled Price-Rutherford in the back of a van, stripped him naked and punched him . 'I know Danny did wrong and he got a really tough judge on the day - but I don’t understand why the burglar should go free. 'I . thought he’d be going down especially with his track record. I don’t . think this will be the last time the courts will be seeing him again. He’s got away with it.' The . incident occurred last June last year when Price-Rutherford and an . accomplice Timothy Hartley, 29, were seen breaking into the house by a . neighbour who took pictures on her mobile phone. Hartley was seen climbing between a gate and up to a window where he forced it open with a hammer. Price-Rutherford . acted as a look out and was handed a tin from an upstairs bedroom where . up to £250 was kept. The burglars also snatched a bottle containing £30 . in change. That evening, Miss Hilton returned home from work to be met by the . neighbour who warned her she had been burgled and showed her the . pictures. Prolific: The 22-year-old serial burglar has 12 convictions to his name, and was on bail for burgling another property at the time . Miss Hilton felt so 'violated' by the raid she was afraid to bring her two children home as she didn’t feel safe. Both burglars were identified in the photos and shortly afterwards Finn, her boyfriend, turned up at a house where Price-Rutherford was staying. He grabbed him by the right arm and pulled him towards the side door of the van demanding the return of the stolen money. The . thief tried to resist, but Howarth appeared and took hold of the . burglar’s other arm and both men forced him into the van. Finn then . turned to the victim and punched him in the face chipping his tooth. The vehicle then set off, but when . the men realised Price-Rutherford could not tell them where the stolen . money was, he was punched another seven or eight times. The . shutters were pulled down and the van was driven around for another . five hours and when he was eventually ejected from the van. The . men had a pit bull type dog with them and Price-Rutherford was made . to made to take off his jacket, t-shirt, socks and shoes before being . kicked to the ground. Devastated: The golf waitress had £280 stored in a tin and £30 stored in a bottle at her home in Blackburn, Lancashire (right), in preparation for the family trip abroad . Price-Rutherford was eventually let go and staggered to a nearby a house where he raised the alarm. In a victim impact statement he said: 'Throughout this time I was so scared I started crying. I honestly thought they were going to kill me.' He was arrested over the burglary but whilst he accepted being present he initially denied keeping watch. On March 28, Howarth, of Blackburn, . was jailed for 44 months whilst Finn, from Blackpool, got 27 months . after they admitted kidnap. At the time Judge Graham Knowles QC told them: 'You decided to punish this man for what you were convinced he had done. 'Your . message was ""cross us and you will pay the price"". If the courts were . to allow that kind of message without severe punishment, the result . would be anarchy. If you cross the law, you must pay the price.' At . Price-Rutherford’s hearing on Thursday no mention was made of the . vigilante attack. He admitted two charges of burglary and was sentenced . to 12 months in prison suspended for 18 months with an 18 month . supervision order. Break-in: Price-Rutherford and an accomplice Timothy Hartley, 29, were seen breaking into the house by a neighbour who took pictures on her mobile phone . His lawyer David Farley said Price-Rutherford’s father had been diagnosed with cancer. He said: 'That’s encouraged and proved his attitude to his own life. His antecedents started in 2012 borne out of the fact he didn’t have a fixed address. 'He would drift around with his friends motivated to commit offences. He was with people who he didn’t have the strength to stand up to or walk away. 'He was put up by people determined to commit crime. He wouldn’t mind me describing him as a shy un-forceful character.' Sentencing Price-Rutherford, the judge Mr Recorder Michael Blakey told him the burglary was 'serious' but added: 'If Mr Farley is right and you recognise you are going down the right road it is all well and good.' Hartley of Blackburn, Lancashire, was given a suspended sentence of 18 months in prison suspended for two years - despite having a record of 30 offences including 16 for theft as well as shoplifting, drug handling and burglary.","Michael Price-Rutherford burgled home in Blackburn, Lancashire .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The Commons expenses watchdog has come under fire for spending £127,000 to replace furniture which it left behind when it moved offices. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority moved to a new central London HQ last weekend. But it left behind luxury items bought just four years ago, including chairs worth £538 each and loungers which cost the taxpayer £465. Ipsa was created in the wake of the expenses scandal and was supposed to curb extravagant spending . Ipsa was set up in the wake of the MPs’ expenses scandal to keep a tighter grip on what public money was being spent on. It followed public outrage at lavish spending, including several MPs who claimed expenses on upmarket chairs, sofas and home makeovers. But now it has emerged that officials who check parliament’s expense claims decided to not to take their own upmarket seating with them when they moved offices. The furniture bought in 2010 includes seven chairs costing £538 each, 14 ‘relaxer’ loungers worth £465 each, 71 meeting room chairs costing £242 each, six stools each with a £265 price tag and a table costing £837, the Standard reported. Lib Dem MP Sir Bob Russell said the Ipsa offices were plusher than those of a Cabinet minister . But Ipsa is moving from its first headquarters at Portland House in Victoria to a new office at 30 Millbank, just a mile away. Bosses chose to leave the furniture behind in the move, claiming it made it easier to rent it out. However, the decision risks angering MPs who have come under intense pressure from Ipsa to curb extravagant spending of any sort. Lib Dem MP Sir Bob Russell told the Standard: ‘I’ve seen it, and the sheer opulence of it is quite extraordinary. ‘It is better quality than you see in any Cabinet minister’s office. ‘No MP would be allowed to indulge I such staggering waste. They would be told to take it with them.’ Overall the office move is said to have cost almost £620,000, but Ipsa claims it has saved “450,000 by letting out its old office and moving into one which is £100,000 cheaper. A spokesman said:’ Our contract in our old office ran until spring next year. ‘We needed to move out and get into a new office. We thought it was better to move before the next general election. We wanted to make sure we could let out the space we had in the old building. We left lots of furniture behind and we have taken quite a lot of the furniture with us.’ Asked why Ipsa spent more than £500 on some chairs, he added: ‘Every office needs a certain amount of break out space.’","Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority under fire for spending .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A pensioner who was found dead at a care home had injuries consistent with choking, police revealed today. Police sealed off a number of rooms at Heathcote care home in Norwich after the woman in her 80s was found dead at 10pm on Wednesday evening. A woman in her 50s from Hethersett near Norwich was arrested following the discovery - but has since been released on bail. A woman found dead at Heathcote Care Home in Norwich on Wednesday had injuries 'consistent with choking' A Home Office post mortem carried out today revealed the woman’s fatal injuries were 'consistent with choking.' But a police spokesman said further tests will be conducted before a formal cause of death can be confirmed. He added: 'It is anticipated that these results will not be received for several weeks.' Detective Chief Inspector Paul Durham, of Norfolk Police, said: 'Investigations continue into the circumstances surrounding her death and are focusing on the standard of care received by the deceased immediately prior to her death.' Heathcote caters for up to 29 residents over the age of 65 and offers short term and long term stays. It is one of several homes which is privately owned and operated by Black Swan International Limited. A woman in her 50s was arrested following the discovery at the home on Wednesday, but has since been released on bail, police confirmed . The manager of the home Becky Wyer was promoted last year from deputy manager. An inspection by the Care Quality Commission in February last year found 'inconsistent support for staff to carry out their roles effectively' and said some workers were not regularly supervised. But when inspectors returned in October they found standards had improved and the home was given a clean bill of health. A spokesman for Black Swan International Limited said: 'We are unable to make a statement at this time because there is an ongoing police investigation into an incident and one of our homes. 'We can confirm that we are fully supporting the relevant authorities in their investigation.'

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Fraudster: Emma Charlton, pictured at an earlier court hearing, admitted to using her mother's bank card to buy £823 of goods, including Apple products . A serial fraudster who faked terminal cancer so her boyfriend would propose, and has posed as a children's doctor and even the editor of Vogue, has been convicted of conning her own mother. Emma Charlton, 30, used her mother's bank card to order goods from the internet worth £800, which she ordered under one of her many aliases. In her former guises she would wear designer clothes and even carry around a toy miniature dog to create the impression of being a high-flyer. She pleaded guilty to one charge of fraud at Newcastle Magistrates' Court this week - the latest in a long series of deceptions, often involving her lovers and close family members, which have totalled hundreds of thousands of pounds. Charlton, who was born Emma Golightly, and has also used the names Amelia Chadwick and Jamie Taylor, had only recently been released from prison, where she was serving an 18-month sentence for previous charges of fraud. In her most audacious gambit, in 2008 she told a previous lover, Neil Lupton, that she was the African-born daughter of a judge, and a photographer whose work had featured in the fashion magazine Vogue. Under this pretence she duped her boyfriend, who believed her fake backstory, into thinking she was suffering from terminal cancer. Aged just 25, she said that her dying wish was to be walked down the aisle in a lavish white wedding. Plans were made for an £80,000 ceremony at Edwardian Slaley Hall Hotel in Northumberland, with Charlton deciding they would need to book out every room in the hotel. When a £10,000 deposit was request, she produced a cheque for the amount - which had been stolen from her grandmother. Incredibly, she also chose this point to substantially upgrade her phoney career, telling staff that she was in fact the editor of Vogue. She told the lie despite bearing no obvious resemblance to the long-serving chief of the fashion magazine, Anna Wintour. However, her fantasy unravelled when a £10,000 cheque she had provided as a deposit - which had been stolen from her own grandmother - bounced. A court later heard how Mr Lupton - who at first refused to believe that his fiancée had lied so comprehensively, 'had been thoroughly and totally conned.' The judge at the hearing told Charlton: 'It was a cruel thing you did to him.' Many of the cheques, stolen from Mr Lupton and her grandmother, were not honoured, but Mr Lupton and various financial institutions were left with a £40,000 bill for those that were. Courtroom chic: Earlier in her series of frauds, Charlton - pictured left after her latest court appearance - claimed to be the editor of Vogue - despite bearing little resemblance to the magazine's actual editor Anna Wintour, right . Not quite: Charlton told hotel staff she edited Vogue - as did the character Miranda Priestly (played above by Meryl Streep) from The Devil Wears Prada . Earlier in her false life of fashion photography, Charlton hit a bump in the road when a £2,800 cheque she paid to the Hilton Hotel in Gateshead for a fashion event in aid of cancer charities was cancelled on the day. She claimed the event had to stop because the clothes for the models had failed to turn up. In this most recent case the victim was again a member of her family. The most recent court hearing was told how Charlton had made the fraudulent purchases on her mother's card in July 2013, using the name Jamie Taylor. Three purchases were made, totalling £823,65. Claire Thomasson, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant obtained her mother’s bank details and charged a number of high-value items to her mum’s card. Grand: In 2009, Charlton tried to book the entire Slaley Hall Hotel in Northumberland for her wedding to Neil Lupton - and told staff she was the editor of Vogue . 'Her mum doesn’t discover anything until she goes to a cashpoint and checks her bank balance. “She realised a number of Apple items had been purchased from John Lewis, as well as other items and groceries. These were purchases she had not made. Further inquiries reveal the goods have been sent to someone called Jamie Taylor. 'The defendant’s mum knew the defendant was in the process of changing her name to that, so she made the connection. The police were then called.' Charlton, who has five convictions, for 46 offences, including 39 for fraud, wept as she listened from the dock. Liz Dunbar, mitigating, said the offence had been committed soon after she’d been released from prison when she was 'not in a good place'. Fraudulent past: Charlton, pictured in January 2007, has conned seven men, three of whom agreed to marry her . She said: 'She was recalled when this offence came to light. She has since got her life back on track. She is seeking assistance in the form of counselling. She has recently started blacking out and she has an implant to monitor her heart. 'She has now found employment as a barber and has a new partner, who knows about her record.' Incredibly, the court was told that her mother, Lynn Golightly, was continuing to support Charlton through the case. After pleading guilty to one charge of fraud by false representation, Charlton, from Newcastle, was given an 18-month community order. Charlton has been given a total of three prison sentences for her series of frauds. She has conned a total of six men - three of whom offered to marry her after believing her story about dying from cancer. 2004: Emma Golightly - as she was then known - runs up a £7,000 bill on her mother's credit card. When challenged she leaves the family home in disgrace. 2007: Golightly is jailed for conning five men, her mother, grandmother and brother out of £254,000. Two of the men had fallen for her cancer story and agreed to marry her. Years of fraud: Charlton, pictured here in 2006, when she went by the name Emma Golightly, has five convictions for 46 offences, including 39 counts of fraud . Early 2008: Golightly is released from prison, and changes her name by deed poll to Emma Chartlon. September 2008: She meets Neil Lupton, and claims to be a Vogue photographer whose father is a judge. 2008-2009: As her romance with Mr Lutpon progresses, Charlton steals cheques from her grandmother and boyfriend totalling £150,000. They were made up of 19 cheques from her grandmother, totalling £126,387 and nine cheques from Mr Lupton, worth £28,402. Not all of them were honoured. Early 2009: Charlton tells Mr Lupton she's dying of cancer, prompting their ill-fated plans to wed at Slaley Hall Hotel, where she tells staff she is the editor of Vogue. May 2009: Charlton is arrested. It emerges that she spent funds taken from Mr Lutpon on exotic holidays, spending money, and food and jewellery. March 2010: She is jailed for three years after pleading guilty to 23 charges of theft and fraud between September 2008 and May 2009. January 2012: Chartlon is released from prison. May 2012: A new victim, Chris Lashford, is conned into thinking Charlton was a hair salon owner called Amelia Chadwick. She claims her father was a judge, her brother a barrister and that there was a £25,000 bounty on her head. Charlton tells Mr Lashford she needed him to be her bodyguard, and the pair are on their way to a flight to New York before her unwitting victim realises her lies, £8,000 the poorer. August 2012: She admits two counts of fraud against Mr Lashford and is jailed for 18 months. July 2013: She attempts to change her name to Jamie Taylor. In the same month she begins defrauding her mother again. April 2014: Charlton is given an an 18-month community order after admitting the frauds.","Emma Chartlon, 30, bought goods online with her mother's bank card .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Group Captain Wendy Williams has been awarded £560,000 in compensation after suing the Ministry of Defence for sexual discrimination . An RAF nurse who helped wounded soldiers has been awarded £560,000 compensation after suing the Ministry of Defence for sexual discrimination. Group Captain Wendy Williams, 54, took the MoD to an employment tribunal after accusing the air force of favouring men instead of women for promotion. The nurse, who treated injured personnel flown into Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital from Afghanistan, brought the case in July 2011 . after being passed over for the position as RAF candidate for the . tri-service role of commodore of the Defence Medical Group. She told the hearing a male doctor who had three-and-a-half years' fewer service than her was given the promotion. The tribunal judge had previously . been told that only six of 470 top positions among the Armed Forces . medical staff had been held by women between 2011 and 2012. In its ruling, the tribunal panel, . led by Ms Dean, criticised the RAF for this . practice and also the low number of women in top ranks overall - . amounting to between 1% and 1.3% of the total. Ms Williams, the highest-ranking RAF nurse, told a previous Birmingham Employment Tribunal  hearing: 'It was apparent the promotion process was stacked against me as a nurse and midwife.' As . a registered nurse and midwife who had served in the RAF since 1984, . and who had been a group captain since 2003, Group Capt Williams . expected to win the role. But . despite her experience, and her being recommended for promotion to a . senior non-nursing role based on her experience, the post went to Group . Capt John Gaffney. The 1* level role went to Group Capt Gaffney despite him having three-and-a-half years fewer service as a Group Captain. Group . Captain Williams claimed the MoD had breached the 2010 Equalities Act . by discriminating against her because of her gender when recruiting for a . role for which she recommended and well-qualified. The nurse , who treated injured personnel at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital, brought the case against the MoD in July 2011 after being passed over for promotion in favour of a male colleague with less experience. Group capt Williams is pictured showing Prince Charles around the hospital . The tribunal was told that it was the . RAF’s procedure to fill medical 1* roles that were theoretically open . to doctors and nurses only with doctors. She . sought compensation after complaining she had been humiliated, . demoralised and 'totally let down' by the RAF’s attitude towards . promoting women - and claimed a male group captain got the top medical . job instead of her. Tribunal . judge Miss Victoria Dean announced at a previous hearing that Ms . Williams was  discriminated against because of her sex. Now the tribunal has ruled the Ministry of Defence should award her a total of £557,038. The total includes £204,079 for loss of earnings, £105,585 pension loss and £22,000 for injury to feelings, plus more than £500 interest. Ms Dean made several recommendations to the MoD in announcing her compensation, including that those involved in promotion of recruitment should receive more training in equality and diversity. Until recently Ms Williams was responsible for the command and control of treating the severely wounded servicemen and women from Afghanistan at the hospital, where the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine is based. The Royal Air Force only had six women in its 470 top jobs last year, the tribunal heard . She had been praised by Brigadier John Parker at the previous tribunal hearing. He said: 'Her performance, during a very demanding period, revealed an officer of great skill, energy, drive and potential as well as having an excellent understanding of the operational environment of an NHS Trust. 'She demonstrated an ability to lead the military part of the joint and combined operation in  Birmingham.' Ms Williams, who showed Prince Charles around the hospital during her career, has now retired and moved to Cambridgeshire. The Ministry of Defence had denied the sex discrimination allegation. Group . Capt Williams said  at the time of the ruling last summer that she was pleased with the decision, saying: . 'Following this decision, I hope that nurses in the Royal Air Force and . the wider Armed Forces will have the opportunity to aspire to, and . attain, more senior posts. 'I hope that nurses will also gain due recognition for their leadership, commitment and professionalism. 'This . judgment represents an opportunity for the Armed Forces to scrutinise . internal processes and practices and shatter glass ceilings. 'It should be used as a platform to . ensure that appointments are made with regard to merit and competencies, . and not with regard to a person’s gender or their membership of a . professional body.' The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, formerly Selly Oak Hospital, is where opeartional casualties are treated after being flown back from war zones. MoD hospital staff are fully integrated with civilian staff and are not limited to treating military patients alone. Staff are drawn from all three services and are liable to be deployed to war zones when needed.","Group Captain Wendy Williams was passed over for promotion in favour of male colleague who had served three-and-a-half years fewer than her .

'I've not got long to go, have I? I'm still attracted to ladies. 'I got that young girl to try to do me a job as, you know, my carer. I think I'm entitled to that.' The prostitute says she gave up sex work two years ago and agreed to be Mr Thipthorpe's carer after they met in a cafe. But the police and council responded to complaints from residents at Elizabeth House in Swindon, where Mr Thipthorpe lives. Other residents have said they are 'alarmed and distressed' by her presence and one elderly lady is so terrified she locks her doors and windows whenever she is there. At Swindon Magistrates Court last July, Pearce admitted she had been with Allan when he had made several large cash withdrawals but claimed they were as payment for her services as a carer. A judge imposed an indefinite ASBO banning Pearce from going near the OAP or entering any of the 32 council-run sheltered housing schemes in the town. 'Vulnerable': Former soldier Allan Thipthorpe, whose wife died two years ago, said he should be able to 'do what he wants' with his own money . 'I have moved on': Pearce, seen left and right . outside court in Swindon in 2003 after a red light district ban, claims she's turned her back on her . old life and her relationship with Mr Thipthorpe is one of patient and carer . Mr Thipthorpe has now been before the same court over the assault, . Rob Ross, defending, told the court: 'You'll probably be aware of Mr Thipthorpe. 'He's an 88-year-old man involved in Asbo proceedings when a young lady was made an Asbo in relation to not seeing him. 'He objected to that and the long and short of it is he ended up hitting Mr Maples.' Mr Ross told the court his client had admitted the assault in police a interview and would not be contesting the offence. He added: 'I would ask the crown why it's necessary to leave an 88-year-old man with a record, why no mind was given to cautioning him?' Ban: A district judge granted an Asbo barring Pearce from Elizabeth House in Swindon after complaints from other residents . District Judge Simon Cooper agreed to adjourn the case to May 28 for the caution to be issued, but warned the prosecution would go ahead if no action was taken. In a separate development, Pearce appeared at Swindon Crown Court this week accused of twice breaching her ASBO in February. The court heard that Allan will appear as a defence witness. The case was adjourned until August 7 at Chippenham Magistrates Court, which has wheelchair access. In 2004 Pearce was given a three-year ASBO banning her from any of the 'red light' areas of Swindon.","Terri-Lee Pearce banned from entering sheltered accommodation by judge .

"By . Wills Robinson . Jailed: Father-of-three Ajaz Budi, 33, was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in prison at the Old Bailey for stealing £2.3m worth of cheques from a Royal Mail sorting office . A postman who stole £2.3million worth of cheques from a Royal Mail sorting office has been jailed for eight-and-a-half years. For three years, father-of-three Ajaz Budi, 33, helped himself to hundreds of parcels from the Mount Pleasant sorting office in Central London in one of the most 'sophisticated' criminal operations the postal service has seen. He was caught when a Royal Mail fraud . investigation team set up secret cameras which filmed him taking the cheques with values ranging from £50 to £110,000. Budi is said to have deliberately targeted the Square Mile, one of the world's biggest financial hubs, during the scam. One of the victims, International legal firm Clyde and Co, lost cheques worth £2,271,289 in just three months as Budi and his accomplices wrongly paid them into accounts they had set up. The court heard piles of cheques worth over £230,000 were also found in Budi’s van when he was arrested and stolen mail was discovered in his car. Budi was earning just £375 a week as a Royal Mail employee but police recovered a total of almost £39,000 at his home and his girlfriend’s flat. He wept uncontrollably as Old Bailey Judge John Bevan sentenced him, saying the theft was on a ‘massive scale’. Judge Bevan said: ‘This appears to be one of the largest scales of theft of mail by a postman that the Royal Mail are aware of. ‘It’s certainly one of the most sophisticated. The Royal Mail is a hallowed and valuable national institution, one of the jewels in the crown of this country. ‘The economy relies on documents being able to be distributed safely and securely.’ The court heard that when the cheques . were stolen they were often paid into bank accounts set up with names . similar to that of the genuine payee. When the fraudsters stole cheques from legal firm Taylor Wessing they were banked into the account of a Mr Taylor Wessing. The Mount Pleasant sorting office is one of the biggest in the world and deals with all the post for the City of London. Judge Bevan added: ‘It’s no . coincidence that on 25 May 2012 both you and your accomplice were . stealing cheques belonging to Clyde and Co and between February and May . 2012 cheques valued at £2.3million were stolen,’ he continued. ‘You . targeted financial post sent to banks, solicitors and even barristers . chambers. You lacked the courage to admit your guilt in the face of . overwhelming evidence,’ Judge Bevan said. Budi told ‘obvious and transparent lies’ in the witness box to try and escape conviction, he added. Operating point: Mount Pleasant sorting office in Central London is one of the biggest in the world and organises mail for the Square Mile financial hub in the City of London . ‘The jury took less than four hours to convict on all eight counts,’ Judge Bevan continued. ‘These thefts and your destroying many documents in addition to those retrieved they were persistent, on a grand scale and with a carefully instated disposal scheme in place.’ ‘There was an effective chain of distribution, it was being done professionally and to make money. ‘There is no knowing what the loss in fact is. It’s on a scale of efficiency and persistence way beyond the reach or skills of the average postman thief. ...‘This appears to be one of the largest scales of theft of mail by a postman that the Royal Mail are aware of'Judge John Bevan at the Old Bailey . ‘It represents a systematic attack on City funds which you have realised did considerable damage on their operation and your employer the Royal Mail.’ He added that Budi failed to ‘cover his tracks’ because he thought he was ‘untouchable’ and even blamed his colleagues for the thefts. Budi also persuaded members of his family to lie to the jury for him, Judge Bevan continued. He also had been able to afford to buy a property for investment and keep a wife, two children and a girlfriend who also had a child. A fourth child is due later this year. Probe: He was caught when a Royal Mail fraud investigation team set up secret cameras in the sorting office . Police also found hundreds of letters, cheque book stubs and credit card details Budi had taken from the post. Budi said that when he was filmed he was just trying to help out with post that had been incorrectly sorted. He said the post found at his home had . been mysteriously sent to him and he did not want to report it to his . bosses because he thought he might get into trouble. But . the jury convicted him of six charges of theft, possessing articles . namely stolen bank books, for use in fraud and possession of criminal . property, between 1 April 2009 and 25 May 2012. Budi, . who denied the charges, was convicted of eight charges including theft, . possession of articles for use in fraud and possession of criminal . property. Loss: One of the victims, London-based firm Clyde and Co, lost had £2,271,289 worth of cheques stolen in just three months .","Ajaz Budi, 33, wept uncontrollably as he was sentenced at the Old Bailey .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Brave: Chantelle Pringle, from Barmston, Tyne and Wear, was just two years old when she had her right foot amputated and all the toes on her left removed . A girl has won a '£1million payout' after she had amputations on both feet because a nurse failed to realise she was suffering from meningitis - and instead, prescribed her Calpol. Chantelle Pringle, from Barmston, Washington, Tyne and Wear, was just two years old when her mother Keeley Grotz, 33, rang the out-of-hours medical phone line for advice. She told a duty nurse her daughter was lethargic, short of breath, wobbly and vomiting - and was advised to give the toddler Calpol and call back if she was still concerned. But Chantelle, now 11, deteriorated rapidly - and by the time she got to hospital, the bacterial blood infection septicaemia had taken hold. Days later, surgeons were forced to amputate her right foot and all of the toes on her left. Today, Chantelle was awarded compensation after a High Court judge ruled the nurse had been negligent in failing to arrange her immediate admission to hospital. Judge Michael Harvey QC told London's High Court that the company that . ran the out-of-hours service, Nestor Prime Care Services Limited, was liable . for the medic's blunder. He added that if the schoolgirl had been treated earlier, her foot and toes would probably have been saved. Although the amount of Chantelle's compensation has yet to be confirmed, her lawyers have valued her claim at about £1million. Acting on behalf of the family, Lisa Sullivan previously told the court that Ms Grotz had called the NHS line operated by Nestor Primecare Services Ltd in the early hours of November 1, 2004. Battle: Chantelle's mother Keeley Grotz (left), 33, rang the out-of-hours medical phone line for advice after her daughter became lethargic, short of breath and wobbly. She was told by a duty nurse to give the toddler Calpol . Private company: Nestor Primecare Services Ltd (pictured) in Hatfield runs the NHS's out-of-hours helpline . She said the concerned mother had told the nurse that Chantelle was 'wobbly, vomiting and just not right', and had also been 'burning up'. Miss Sullivan claimed the medic should have arranged for an emergency ambulance to be called - but instead, she prescribed Calpol, an over-the-counter paracetamol syrup. During the night, Chantelle 'kept waking up' and her mother called an ambulance in the morning after she noticed blemishes on her legs, the court heard. Recovering: But Chantelle (pictured with her mother in 2005) deteriorated rapidly - and by the time she got to hospital, the bacterial blood infection septicaemia had taken hold. Surgeons had to amputate her foot and toes . Happy again: Today, Chantelle was awarded compensation after a High Court judge ruled the nurse had been negiligent in failing to range her immediate admission to hospital.  Above, Chantelle is pictured aged two . The toddler was then diagnosed with meningococcal septicaemia - and spent eight days on life support in intensive care, where her hands and feet turned black. However, she pulled through after surgeons removed her foot and toes. Speaking at the time, Ms Grotz said: 'She came down with a temperature and was feeling a bit drowsy - I thought it was the flu. Success: Although the amount of Chantelle's compensation has yet to be confirmed, her lawyers have valued her claim at about £1million. Above, Chantelle in 2008 . 'I called the emergency doctor and he said to leave her until the morning. Next day, I noticed she had a few spots. 'It took a couple of minutes for the ambulance to get here. I was shaking, but they took over. I didn't want to watch. I had to leave the bedside because it was touch and go. 'I didn't know anything about septicaemia. It wasn't until they put her on a life support machine that they told us. 'They told me if I had waited for an emergency doctor to come, she would have died. 'The first 48 hours were the most critical, whether she would pull through or not. It was just a matter of hoping she would. 'Her feet were really black and her hands were too. You could tell they were actually gone. Her hands were saved by all the stuff she was on - the nine machines around her.' In a two-hour operation on December 6, surgeons removed Chantelle's right foot and five toes from her left. Her family remained at her bedside until she was allowed home on December 22. Chantelle now has a false leg. Judge Harvey QC said that, had the nurse correctly noted Chantelle's symptoms, Nestor Prime Care's computer system would have prompted her to call for an ambulance straight away. He added that had Chantelle been admitted to hospital by about 1am that night - rather than more than 10 hours later - she would swiftly have been given antibiotics, and the double amputation would probably not have been necessary. Nestor Prime Care admitted the nurse had been negligent in failing to arrange for a doctor to call at the family home. But the firm disputes claims the medic should have called for an ambulance immediately - saying that if she had, it would have made no difference to the outcome. The amount of Chantelle's compensation will be calculated at a further court hearing, unless final settlement terms are reached before then.","Chantelle Pringle, then two, was lethargic, short of breath and vomiting .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Guilty: William Owen, 55, pleaded guilty to murdering his partner Sharon Hayter and their disabled daughter Stephanie Owen . A ‘doting father’ has been jailed for life after pleading guilty to killing his long-term partner and their disabled daughter in a brutal double murder. William Owen - described by the judge as a 'loving' parent - was jailed for a minimum of 23 years and one-and-a-half months after pleading guilty to murdering his partner Sharon Hayter and their daughter Stephanie Owen. Liverpool Crown Court was told how Miss Hayter, 55, . and Miss Owen, 29, were found dead at their home in Knowsley, . Merseyside, on November 28, after being attacked with a claw hammer. But the court heard there is still no . clear reason for why Owen, a former hospital nursery nurse and security . guard, committed the brutal murders. Sentencing Owen today, Mrs Justice Carr said: 'No one but yourself can say what was going on in your mind that morning.' A post-mortem carried out after their deaths found both women had died from blunt force trauma to the head. The murder weapon - believed to be a claw hammer - was never recovered. Owen, . who the court heard had made sacrifices to care for his disabled . daughter, had been set to face trial for the murders on Wednesday. Happier times: Miss Hayter, 55, pictured here with Stephanie, the daughter she shared with Owen. He killed them at their home in Knowsley, Merseyside - but the reason for the savage double murder is still unknown . He had previously claimed that he did . not kill Stephanie and tried to lay the blame on his dead partner, who . was the only other person present. But in a last minute change of heart, he changed his plea and admitted the killings. Today, the victims’ family said they were glad the 'truth has come out'. The scene of the double murder where Owen murdered his partner and daughter in November last year . Speaking on behalf of Sharon’s family, her brother, Darren Barnett, said: 'The family are satisfied following the guilty plea today in relation to the murder of our sister Sharon and niece Stephanie in November last year. 'In a . previous court appearance it was suggested by the defence barrister that . William Owen did not kill Stephanie and inferred that Sharon may well . have murdered her own daughter. 'Today the truth has come out and he has pleaded guilty on both counts. 'We would like to take this opportunity to thank the police and Crown Prosecution Service for bringing the case to court. 'Sadly, we . will never know why he murdered Sharon and Stephanie, and we are left . with the lasting emotional scars and are still trying to come to terms . with what has happened.' The judge told Owen: 'You will leave prison an elderly man, if you leave prison at all. Forensics examine the scene after the deaths of Miss Hayter and Miss Owen. William Owen was expected to stand trial for the crimes but today changed his pleas to guilty . 'For . reasons best known to yourself on the morning of Saturday, November 28, . 2013 you carried out a vicious attack on these two women with some sort . of heavy instrument. 'You caused fatal head injuries to each. Neighbours heard screaming from the house at around 7.30am. 'You . told police shortly after the attack that you had used a hammer which . would be consistent with the medical evidence available as to the . injuries inflicted. 'But . nothing that the court has been told about you and your circumstances - . whether because of your relationship with Miss Hayter or because you . were simply frustrated by your environment or stressed by your . daughter’s physical difficulties - could possibly justify your actions . that day. 'I . am quite satisfied you intended to kill these women however much you . may have regretted it later and however much you regret it now.'

"By . Sean Poulter . Supermarkets could be forced to pull copycat products from shelves after a small British food firm won a High Court injunction against the budget chain Aldi. The German retailer has been forced to remove its ‘Saucy Salmon Fillets’ from sale following complaints from the Saucy Fish Company. The packaging and product recipes of the Aldi products bear an uncanny resemblance to those made and promoted by the Grimsby based firm. Likeness: The Saucy Fish Co. sells salmon fillets in a black container with a clear film and a cardboard sleeve (right). The Aldi product (left) looks virtually identical in terms of pack design and sauce options . Aldi is among a number of high street stores who are trying to win sales by copying the pack design, colours and names used by big brands, which spend millions developing and promoting their products. The interim injunction won by the Saucy Fish Company is a prelude to a full court hearing that could see Aldi forced to pay compensation for effectively stealing the idea. That could set a precedent that would allow other brands to take on all the big supermarkets which try to boost sales and profits by developing copycat products. The Saucy Fish Co. sells salmon fillets in a black container with a clear film over the top and a cardboard sleeve with the company name and description of the contents. One product contains a chilli, lime and ginger dressing, while the other has a watercress and crème fraiche dressing. The Aldi product looks virtually identical in terms of pack design and the two sauce options, while the bold label describes them as ‘Saucy Salmon Fillets’. Uncanny: Aldi's Jive caramel and chocolate shortcakes bear a resemblance to the world famous Twix bar . Confusing: Aldi's Norpak Spreadable (right) could easily be mistaken for Lurpak Spreadable (left) The interim injunction won by the Saucy Fish Company is a prelude to a full court hearing that could see Aldi forced to pay compensation for effectively stealing the idea . The Saucy Fish Co is a British success story. It was recently voted a CoolBrand and signed a listing with Waitrose earlier this year, while its products will soon be going into stores in the USA. It is easy to see why Aldi, which is making a concerted effort to attract middle class shoppers, should want to emulate its success. However, head of brand at the Grimsby fish company, Simon Smith, said: ‘Aldi’s imitation of The Saucy Fish Co. undermines the trust and confidence consumers have built with us. Our brand represents a promise of consistency, not easily replicable by packaging alone. ‘Originality and innovation are two of our watchwords, built through investment over the last three years as we've nurtured and grown a unique and desired brand, now valued at £35m. It’s really important for us to protect our distinctive brand identity as a mark of premium quality, as we grow our brand globally. '’Ghost’ brands that trade on the halo effect of an established brand simply should not be tolerated and I’m sure other brand owners will be watching this case with interest.’ Research by the consumer group Which? found many shoppers are angry at supermarkets who try to mislead them by copying brands. A study found one in five of its members have accidentally bought a supermarket version of a product thinking it was a well-known brand. Of those, 38 per cent said they were annoyed and 30per cent felt misled. Similar: Drinkers could easily be forgiven for confusing Aldi's own-brand alcohol with more famous products. Austin's Summer Punch closely resembles Pimm's, while its Sainte Etienne lager looks like Stella Artois . Crunch: Orange packs of Aldi's Belmont Oaties (right) look very much like McVitie's Hobnobs (left) Its research among 150 own-label products found that the cheeky monkey on boxes of Harvest Morn Choco Rice sold by Aldi could quite easily be mistaken for the character used by Kellogg’s for its Coco Pops. Similarly, the orange packs of Aldi’s Savour Bakes Cream Crackers look very much like the Jacob’s product, while its Norpak Spreadable could be mistaken for Lurpak Spreadable. The firm’s Belmont Oaties were also similar to McVitie’s Hobnobs and its Tower Gate Milk Chocolate Digestives look like the McVitie’s product. Asda has also come under fire for its Puffin brand of chocolate biscuits, which are very similar to the Penguin brand from McVitie’s, while Lidl’s Samson Malt Vinegar could be mistaken for the Sarsons brand. However, other mainstream stores have also been accused of using the same tactic by Which? and the British Brands Group, which speaks for manufacturers. Examples include Boots anti-dandruff shampoo, where the white bottle and blue cap and lettering look remarkably similar to Head & Shoulders. Similarly, Boots vibrant pink bottle for its ‘Fruit Essence’ shampoo is remarkably like the one for Clairol’s popular ‘Herbal Essences’. Tesco’s tubes of ‘Chipz’ look very much like the market leaders ‘Pringles’, while ‘Beasty Bites’ from Asda appear to owe much to the look of packs of Monster Munch. Lidl’s Samson Malt Vinegar (left) could be mistaken for Sarson's famous version of the same product (right) Director of the British Brands Group, John Noble, said this is the first time a food company has won an interim injunction in these circumstances. ‘Mimicking the packaging designs of familiar brands is a trick to boost sales. A recent government study shows that shoppers make more mistakes and perceive products to be better quality, and are therefore more likely to buy them, than if the packaging is clearly distinctive,’ he said. ‘It is extremely rare for Courts to grant interim injunctions so this is a good result for the Saucy Fish Company. The penny is beginning to drop that shoppers are not well served by such copying and the Government is consulting on making consumer protection law more effective in this area. ‘This would be good news. Such copying free-rides off brand reputations and does not offer shoppers real choice. Products should compete on their own merits and not mislead shoppers or act as parasites on brands.’ Aldi’s Giles Hurley, who is managing director of corporate buying, confirmed an interim injunction had been implemented, but he said the firm had planned to remove the product from sale. He said the injunction was under review and no final decision had been made by the court as to whether it had wrongly or unfairly copied the product. He said: ‘This matter refers to a product that was being trialled in our stores and which has since reached the natural end of the trial period. It is important to note that no decision has been made regarding the upholding of the injunction.’","Saucy Fish Company claimed supermarket's products resembled its own .

"By . Lizzie Parry . After eight years missing, living on the streets and battling the elements, returning to the safe haven of home should be a welcome relief. But not for adventurous moggy Thomas, the black tom cat. After nearly a decade on the run, the pet cat gave his owner Elizabeth Shaw a surprise after the pair were reunited - sinking his sharp teeth into her hand 10 times, leaving her needing hospital treatment. Thomas the cat returned to his Dalkeith home in February after eight years on the run. But after getting itchy feet again this week, the black and white cat lashed out at owner Elizabeth Shaw, biting her 10 times . He disappeared from the mother-of-two's Dalkeith home in Midlothian, Scotland in 2005. And so Ms Shaw was amazed when she was reunited with her treasured pet in February. But after two months at home, Thomas started to get itchy feet once more, disappearing on Wednesday for 24 hours. When the 13-year-old black and white moggy returned and Ms Shaw spotted him lurking in her garden she went to grab him, fearing he would wander off again. But Thomas did not take kindly to having his independence taken away, and lashed out, turning and sinking his sharp teeth into Ms Shaw's right hand. He bit the 45-year-old 10 times, drawing blood and causing an infection that resulted in Ms Shaw being admitted to the Royal Infirmary Hospital in Edinburgh. She said doctors have warned her she could require an operation to clear the infection, if it fails to clear up. Despite Thomas's dramatic return home, Ms Shaw has said the fact he is home is 'all that matters'. The 45-year-old mother-of-two (right) suffered 10 bite wounds, which got infected. She was taken to the Royal Infirmary Hospital in Edinburgh where medics warned her she might need an operation to clear the infection .

He bit me 10 times and I had to come home from work.' Thomas reappeared in February after he was befriended by a woman in nearby Bonnyrigg.

"By . Sam Cunningham . Follow @@samcunningham . Arsene Wenger has demanded that UEFA crack down hard on Manchester City for breaching financial fair play rules. City were found to have violated FFP regulations — the rules set up to stop clubs spending more than they earn — and it is expected they will have their wage bill cut for their Champions League squad next season. And Wenger said he will feel ‘let down’ if UEFA do not severely punish City and has called on the authorities to take serious action. ‘There are rules to apply for financial fair play,’ said Wenger, whose club posted a £6.7m profit earlier this year. ‘If you don’t respect them, you have to apply the rules.

Big-spenders: But Pellegrini has rejected those claims for his 'over-spending' team . ‘One . of the rules is that normally you should be banned for the excess of . the financial amount that is not justified, that is if you are £100m . overboard, you should be punished for £100m of your wages bill in the .

Van Gaal will bring his own backroom team to Old Trafford, casting uncertainty over the futures of Giggs’s assistants Paul Scholes, Phil Neville and Chris Woods, while Nicky Butt is set to be offered his old role with the Under-18s. Giggs, meanwhile, is known to be unsure if he wants to be part of the new regime. He grew frustrated with his lack of input under David Moyes after being named player-coach last summer, and knows that he is likely to have even less say with Van Gaal at the helm. What became of the likely lads? The futures of United's 'Class of 92' on the coaching staff are uncertain . Publicly, he praised United’s prospective new boss yesterday. Privately, there are reservations as talks with United chief Ed Woodward continue. Pressed on his future at Old Trafford, Giggs refused to look beyond the end of the season. May 3 Sunderland (H)May 6 Hull City (H)May 11 Southampton (A) ‘He (Van Gaal) has got a brilliant reputation and is a successful manager in different countries,’ he said. ‘He’s taken Holland to the World Cup. Yes, he’s got fantastic pedigree. ‘I’m constantly speaking to Ed. Developments change all the time. At the moment he’s just letting me getting on with preparing the team and doing the best I can on the training pitch and preparing the team for winning the next three games. ‘Nothing’s changed. It’s just until the end of the season. We’ll chat when that’s over and that’s all. Right hand man: The Holland manager may want to bring in his own staff, which may include Patrick Kluivert (R) ‘There is no point in thinking if I want to be an assistant or a manager somewhere else. There’s so many things to think about. My concentration isn’t on next season it’s on this season.’ It raises the prospect of Giggs, the most decorated player in English football since making his United debut 23 years ago, leaving the club after next weekend’ s final game against Southampton. Indeed, he might already have played his last game at Old Trafford after a record 962 appearances for the club. ‘It’s not something I’ve thought about,’ he added. ‘We’ll just have to wait and see. My main priority is winning the games. Is me playing giving us the best chance? ‘I’ve got a lot to think about, whether to carry on playing. I’m still training and doing bits and pieces so I’m still in the frame of maybe being involved in the remaining games.’ Old guard: Giggs hopes that veterans Rio Ferdinand (R) and Patrice Evra stay on at Old Trafford . Despite uncertainty over his own future, Giggs backed fellow veterans Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra to extend their playing careers at United if given the chance. ‘I’d like them to stay on,’ he said. ‘It’s their decision, their contracts are both up. They have both given massive service to the club and they are both fit, and looked good last week. I don’t see why not. ‘It’s everyone’s decision – Rio, Pat, Ed and whoever is the manager next year – but I still think they have a lot to offer. They’ve been great players and remain assets to a club like Manchester United.’","Ryan Giggs has praised Louis van Gaal's 'fantastic pedigree' to become the next Manchester United manager .

"By . Dan Bloom . A toddler who survived a Taliban gun attack which killed his journalist father, mother, brother and sister has arrived in Canada to start a new life. Just two years old, Abuzar Ahmad slipped into a coma after militants opened fire during a family meal at a luxury hotel in the Afghan capital Kabul. Six weeks on he has made a miracle recovery, and yesterday he put on a brave face before 100 well-wishers at Pearson Airport in Toronto, where many of his family members live. Survivor: Abuzar Ahmad slipped into a coma after being shot five times in a Taliban attack which killed his father, mother, brother and sister in Kabul. He has arrived in Canada to start a new life with his uncle Bashir . Innocent: Abuzar, who will soon turn three, playing at home before he left on the two-day flight to Toronto . Agence France-Press (AFP) reporter Sardar Ahmad was killed in the attack on Kabul's Serena hotel. This picture was taken just hours before Mr Ahmad, his wife and two of his three children were gunned down . The toddler was accompanied by his uncle Bashir Mirzad, one of several relatives who stepped into the breach to look after him after he was hit by bullets five times. Also with Abuzar were his new legal guardians, his cousin Turaj Rais Mohammad, 25, and Mr Mohammad's wife Zuhra Rais. Speaking days after the attack, the . boy's cousin said: 'Now he's completely in recovery mode.... Abuzar . gives me hope. We are looking forward to a bright future for him.' He said Abuzar had even reached out to grab his iPhone to play a video game, though he was unable to do so. The flights from Kabul to Toronto took two days and ended in emotional scenes at the airport, where relatives and supporters held banners adorned with photos of the boy in hospital. Hospital: A photograph of the toddler after the attack which was released by his family to show its impact . Glare of the cameras: The boy arrived after a 48-hour journey and was greeted by more than 100 people . Media attention: The boy's father was a respected journalist for Agence France-Presse. Pictured is his uncle . Touching: Family and well-wishers held portraits of Abuzar yesterday as they waited for him to arrive . Toys: The toddler was showered with gifts ranging from a single red rose to an Amazing Spider-Man figure . The toddler was a native of Afghanistan and lost his six-year-old sister Nilofar and four-year-old brother Omar in March's shooting. The rampage shocked journalists and diplomats in Afghanistan because it happened in a restaurant of the Serena Hotel, seen as one of the safest in the country. It was a heavily-guarded favourite of the city's elite, and to commit the attack the four gunmen - dressed in traditional Afghan tunics - slipped small pistols past security in their shoes and waited for three hours before opening fire. On the night of the shooting several people were at a buffet meal in the restaurant to celebrate the Persian New Year. Nine people were shot dead at close range, including Abuzar's 40-year-old father Sardar. The journalist was a senior correspondent for the highly-respected news agency Agence France-Press. Family: Abuzar with his cousin Turaj arriving in Toronto (left) and at Kabul International Airport (right) Ready for a new life: An obituary described his father as 'a charming and talented journalist equally at ease covering Afghanistan's wrenching conflict as with colourful tales including a lion who lived on a roof' High-five: Abuzar, with scars still visible on his knee, plays at home in Kabul before departing for Canada . An obituary described him as 'a charming and talented journalist equally at ease covering Afghanistan's wrenching conflict as with colourful tales including a lion who lived on a roof.' The attack, for which the Taliban claimed responsibility, was timed to cause upset ahead of the country's presidential election last month. The Gathering of Afghan Journalists Group released a statement on the 'tragic' events in which they described the attack as 'cowardly'. A tribute was paid to the 'experienced' and 'renowned' journalist. 'This incident comes despite the fact that Afghan journalists have assiduously tried to remain neutral in their coverage amid difficult circumstances,' the statement said. 'In this attack, the Taliban deliberately and ruthlessly targeted civilians, shooting women and innocent children around the dinner table.'","Two-year-old Abuzar Ahmad was with family when militants opened fire .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A young boy died from an asthma attack after a 'tragic' blunder from a 999 call handler led to the ambulance arriving 23 minutes after the emergency call was made. Eight-year-old Clayton Barker, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, started struggling for breath while enjoying a sleepover at his grandmother's house in March last year, an inquest heard. But when his grandmother Elaine Barker phoned 999, the operator thought the emergency was less serious than it was. Clayton Barker, pictured with his mother Gemma, died from an asthma attack, after a blunder by a 999 operator meant the emergency call was categorised as less serious than it was . It meant the next waiting ambulance was . sent to another emergency instead - and Clayton was not reached by . paramedics until 23 minutes after the call. The young boy was eventually taken to hospital by ambulance staff, but was pronounced dead on arrival. Tests showed he died of an acute asthmatic attack. The tragedy - described as a 'subconscious and isolated mistake' - unfolded when the call handler asked a scripted question, but took the wrong answer, the inquest at Heywood Magistrates' Court was told. The call operator - who had taken nearly 80 calls during the 12-hour shift - asked Clayton's grandmother: 'Is he having any difficulty speaking through breaths?'. But when the operator heard Clayton mutter something in the background, she wrongly registered the answer as 'no' instead of 'yes'. It meant Clayton's situation was thought to be less urgent than it was - leading to a 13-minute delay in the ambulance arriving. If the ambulance had been sent the first time, it could have arrived at Clayton's grandmother's within six minutes - at 7.27pm - from a station located just six miles away, the inquest was told. 'Full of life': Clayton, who had suffered with the condition since he was five, was said to be 'mischievous' and 'full of energy and life' Young Clayton, described by his mother as 'full of life and energy' was not reached by paramedics until 23 minutes after the 999 call. He was taken to hospital but pronounced dead on arrival . But, after the call was labelled as 'green' rather than a life-threatening 'red', the ambulance was not sent as a priority. Instead, an ambulance was not sent until 7.29pm, from a station 11 miles away. It meant the ambulance arrived for Clayton at 7.40pm - 13 minutes after the first ambulance could have arrived. The inquest has been adjourned until June for an expert witness to be called to establish whether the time difference could have made a difference to Clayton's life being saved. Clayton, one of three brothers, had been diagnosed with asthma when he was five, the inquest was told. Attacks could be triggered by being . exposed to cat and dog fur and hot summer weather. Clayton had often . been admitted to hospital due to asthma attacks, including that same week. Clayton was enjoying a sleepover at his grandmother's house when he started 'wheezing', the inquest at Heywood Coroners' Court was told . Bur four days later, Clayton was at a sleepover at his grandmother's home in Derker, Oldham, when he started wheezing heavily. His mother Gemma Barker, 31, who described her son as 'mischievous and full of life and energy', told the inquest her son had played outside after school. But she'd received a worried phone call from her mother just after 7.15pm. Ms Barker said: . 'She said Clayton was wheezing. I thought he was okay but I could hear . him in the background. I told her to give him his inhaler. 'Whilst on the phone I could hear . Clayton panicking. I could tell by the tone of his voice. I told her I . would come back and that she should ring the ambulance.' His mother Miss Barker, pictured here, rushed to his grandmother's house by taxi. She said her son was running around trying to catch his breath and she'd never seen him in such a state before . While Clayton's grandmother rang 999, Ms Barker phoned a taxi who took her to the house. When she . arrived at the house, and there was no ambulance in sight, she assumed . Clayton had already been taken to hospital, she told the inquest. But then she saw Clayton running out of the house, wheezing. She said: 'He . was running around the garden, he was trying to get his breath back. He . was leaning back. I had never seen him in such a state before. 'He collapsed as I was holding him. I . was lifting him up off the ground, carrying him like a baby to get him . to the taxi. His eyes just shut and he stopped breathing and he was . limp.' The inquest heard the 999 operator had wrongly thought the young boy was not struggling to breathe. It meant the next available ambulance - which would have arrived at the home 13 minutes earlier - was sent elsewhere instead . Clayton's grandmother made a second 999 call to find out the whereabouts of the ambulance. Meanwhile, the taxi driver attempted to give Clayton CPR. An ambulance eventually arrived at 7.40pm and left the house at 7.56pm, the inquest heard. It arrived at Royal Oldham Hospital at 8.02pm, but the boy was pronounced dead on arrival. Angela Lee, assistant service manager at the emergency centre of North West Ambulance Service, said inquiries showed the call handler had made an error while asking a series of scripted questions. The Royal Oldham Hospital in Manchester, where Clayton was taken by paramedics . Mrs Lee said: 'We went through the call. The caller heard him in the background. She asked ‘is he having any difficulty speaking through breaths?’ 'The caller said she heard the child speak in the background and in her subconsciousness clicked ‘no’ when it was ‘yes’. We have talked about valuing the integrity of the caller. It is a human error.' Due to the mistake, Clayton's attack was coded as 'green' instead of the more serious 'red'. Mrs Lee explained life-threatening conditions were categorised as Red 1 and Red 2, which means the ambulance service respond in eight minutes. Green 1 and 2 are to be responded to in 20 minutes and Green 3 within 60 minutes, she said. The inquest, heard at Heywood Coroners' Court, has been adjourned so an expert witness can be called. The coroner wants the expert to shed light on whether the delay in the ambulance arrival had a significant impact on Clayton's death . She said: 'The first call received by the emergency operator was at 7.17pm on March 14. It was given a green 1 response. The call for Clayton was green and should have been code red.' Due to the coding of Clayton’s case, the next available vehicle was sent to the home of a two-year-old toddler instead, the court was told. The ambulance which was eventually sent to the Barker house was dispatched from Ashton-under-Lyne, 11 miles away. That first ambulance was stationed just six miles away. Mrs Lee said: 'That evening was extremely busy. There was a huge influx of emergency calls after 6.05pm. 51 calls were sending. 'At 7pm there were 58 incidents still waiting. We had to instigate calling back emergency calls. It shows the significant demand that evening. 'The call taker has had a period of reflective action which has meant she has reflected on the on the call itself. 'She listened to it to see what went wrong. We have also issued a bulletin to staff of NWAS about the importance of recording information accurately given by the caller.' Representing NWAS, lawyer Mr James Down: 'It is an isolated error by a person. It is human error, a tragic mistake.' Coroner Simon Nelson said: 'Mrs Barker you have shown great dignity by your presence here today.'You will remember with great affection all the great traits Clayton clearly had in his character. 'I also commend Mrs Lee for coming forward and giving the evidence as she has done so.'","Clayton Barker, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, died of asthma attack .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Five rare monkeys worth thousands of pounds have been stolen from a zoo by thieves who deal in 'prestige pets' on the black market, it has been claimed. Thieves stole the tamarin monkeys - three of which are endangered species - from two separate monkey enclosures during a 'planned a premeditated' late-night raid in Blackpool Zoo, Lancashire. One of the stolen monkeys was carrying a three-month old baby, while concerns have been raised that the baby monkey who was snatched will die if separated from its mother. Five monkeys have been stolen from Blackpool Zoo, Lancashire in a late-night raid. The five monkeys included this baby cotton-top tamarin, pictured, and two female cotton-top tamarins, one pictured, which are critically-endangered species . One of the stolen female cotton-top tamarins, which were born in primate at the zoo, was pregnant and could be in a particularly vulnerable state . Staff at the zoo have warned that the monkeys, all born in captivity at the zoo, need extremely specialist care to survive. Charlotte . Pennie, head of the primate enclosure at the zoo said: 'We are very . concerned about where the animals are because if they're not looked . after properly they will get ill and die. 'If the baby is taken away from its mother it will not be able to cope and it will die. 'Primates . do not make good pets. They have to have a large area, they have . special requirements and special diets, they live in large groups, they . don't deal with stress very well.' The stolen animals - said to be worth thousands on the black market - include two female cotton-top tamarins, aged 12 years and 18 months, and one baby cotton-top tamarin. The cotton-top tamarin is one of the most critically-endangered primates, with only 6,000 in the wild. It is also one of the smallest primates on earth. The monkeys, which included this emperor tamarin, are said to need specialist care in order to survive. Wildlife experts and the zoo staff are concerned for their welfare . It is feared the stolen animals, including this emperor tamarin, could be sold on the black market for thousands to those who want 'prestige pets' Two male emperor tamarins, aged five months and 7 years - said to be popular with the zoo's guests due to their trademark white moustache - were also taken. Thieves stolen the cotton-top tamarins, pictured, on Tuesday night by creating a hole in one of the fences protecting the zoo . Experts . say small monkeys such as tamarins and macaques are becoming an . increasingly popular pet in America, despite a ban by several states . on owning a primate. There are fears the stolen animals will now be taken out of Britain to be sold on . the black market as 'pets' for wealthy buyers. But experts say that these monkeys, who have extremely 'sensitive systems', can die shortly after being bought due to being in the wrong, more stressful environment. Lancashire police is . now working with the National Wildlife Crime Unit to track down the stolen animals and have issued an alert on all ports. Police . believe the animals were targeted specifically and have circulated . their details to all ports and airports in case the thieves try to take . them abroad. The . thefts took place when raiders cut a hole in a perimeter fence at the . zoo, overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday this week. It is thought zookeepers spotted the theft when they opened up for business on Wednesday. Ms Pennie added: 'I have . worked here for 12 years and the majority of the animals who were taken . last night have been born while I have been here. 'It's . absolutely devastating for us. They are invaluable to the zoo as they are . part of a breeding group. The empty hut at Blackpool zoo from where the monkeys were stolen. Staff at the zoo said the remaining monkeys have been 'quiet and subdued' since the incident . Blackpool Zoo, where thieves struck to steal five precious monkeys . The cotton-top tamarin is one of the most critically-endangered - and smallest - primates in the world. The species was listed in the 'The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates' between 2008 and 2012. The wild population is estimated at around 6,000. The species is found in tropical forests in northwestern Colombia. Its diet . includes insects and plant extracts. It is thought that, historically, up to 40,000 cotton-top tamarins were caught and exported for use in biomedical research. But in 1976, they were given the highest level of protection and all international trade was banned. But . the species is still at risk, because their natural habitat is being destRoyed. The lowland forest in Colombia has been reduced to five percent of its previous area. The cotton-top tamarin is easily spotted by the long white crest reaching from its forehead to its shoulders. The emperor tamarin is native to the Amazon rainforest. Its name is derived from its imperial-looking long white moustache. 'Now vital members of the breeding group . have been taken so we can no longer breed the animals, which is terrifying . as they are both endangered species.' 'The emperors are really popular in the zoo because they have a big white moustache. 'Visitors come and see them and comment on their moustache and make references to Movember. 'The monkeys are loved by visitors of all ages. They come right up to the window and they can be very active.' She added that the mood at the zoo had been very different since the raid. She said: 'They . live in family groups and they protect each other. Today the behaviour . of the animals is not normal because adults have been taken. The rest of . the group seem quiet and subdued. 'They . would have been very scared last night. I would be surprised if the . male didn't try to attack the people who came in and took the other . animals.' Zoo director Darren Webster . said: 'We are extremely saddened by the theft of these monkeys. It is . imperative they receive the correct care in order to survive. 'All . the animals were born here at Blackpool Zoo and are part of our zoo . family, so I would like to urge anyone with any information to contact . the police.' PC . Steve Higgs said: 'It would appear from the way that these thieves have . broken into the zoo that this was a planned and premeditated crime.' 'The offenders knew what they were looking for and knew that the monkeys would be in the enclosures. 'I would appeal for anyone who has any information or any witnesses who saw anything suspicious on Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning to get in touch. 'It may be that there were dog walkers around at that time who may have seen people acting suspiciously. 'I would also appeal to anyone who may be offered these animals for sale to contact the police.' Andy McWilliam, investigations officer at the National Wildlife Crime Unit, added: 'There is definitely a market for these monkeys. We are making enquires across Europe in a bid to try and trace them.' Last year, Justin Bieber famously acquired a Capuchin named OG Mally. But the singer left the . pet in Germany after it was seized for not having the proper . vetting documents. He also left a $8000 dollar vets bill for caring for the monkey.","Five monkeys stolen from Blackpool Zoo, Lancashire in late-night raid .

"By . Jennifer Newton . and Kelly Strange . Corraine Casey gave off the impression of being the perfect mother while hiding a heroin addiction . A former drug addict who started using heroin when she had two young children has spoken of her own battle with drugs and who like Peaches Geldof appeared to be the perfect mother. Corraine Casey, now 35, started using the drug when she had two young children and even fell pregnant with her third child Georgia while she was still using. Her story echoes that of Ms Geldof, also a mother to 23-month-old Astala and 11-month-old Phaedra, who was found dead at her home in Kent last month. Today it was confirmed at the opening of an inquest that heroin played a role in her tragic death. In a case of history repeating itself, Peaches' own mother Paula Yates died from an accidental heroin overdose in 2000, aged 41. Both Ms Casey and Ms Geldof had to deal with the death of a parent at a young age and then juggled bringing up two very young children, seeming to be perfect mothers. Ms Casey said: 'Our stories are pretty similar. We both had traumatic childhoods and both lost a parent. I was a young mum struggling with grief and the drugs offered me a refuge from that pain. ‘I juggled drug use and two small babies and nobody had a clue. To the outside world I was the perfect mum. ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if it was the same for Peaches. ‘If it is the case I feel desperately sorry that she didn’t get the help she needed. I did and it saved my life meaning my children didn’t have to grow up without a mother. ‘I am so grateful for that. ‘It sounds awful but without it I wasn’t able to be a mother because I simply could not function. ‘It got to the point where I needed heroin to be able to be a mum. I couldn’t cook the dinner or clean up without it. I told myself I had to keep using to be a good mum.’ Ms Casey, of Lincoln kept her addiction a secret from her family and friends by not seeing them as frequently and making sure there were no visible signs of drug use. And she believes it would have been even easier for someone in the public eye to hide an addiction. Peaches, with her two young sons Phaedra, left and Astala, right. It was confirmed today heroin played a part in her death last month . Ms Casey appeared to be the perfect mother and kept her addiction to heroin a secret from her family and friends . ‘We only see what they want us to see. Peaches would have been able to prepare for TV appearances by getting her hair and make up done and making sure she was on form and presentable, ' she speculated. ‘But that doesn’t mean it wasn’t a different story at home. ‘You can give off the impression of being a fantastic parent while being addicted to heroin. I know because I did it and it would have been even easier with more money. ‘My mother had no idea at all I was a heroin user. ‘I would tidy the house and make an extra effort with my hair and make up to look fit and well. It’s easy to make people see what you want them to see because they believe what they want to believe. Corraine Casey, left, said she too lost a parent at a very young age, similar to Peaches Geldof, right . ‘Nobody wants to believe that a young mum responsible for two babies is addicted to heroin so if anyone ever questioned me I told them not to be silly and that was the end of it.’ But behind closed doors Corraine’s use of heroin was affecting her parenting. She added: 'If I had taken the drug I was happy and able to play with the children in the park and run the home, but of course that had financial implications because we had little money. ‘Once I sold the TV to pay for heroin and the house was always cold because we couldn’t afford heating.’ ‘I told myself that it was OK because I needed the drugs to be a good mum. Only later when I got clean could I see how twisted that idea was.’ Corraine said that nobody wanted to believe that a young mum responsible for two babies was addicted to heroin . The former addict only managed to turn her life around after her third daughter, Georgia was born in August 2002. It was the shame of giving birth to a daughter addicted to drugs that made her seek help. She explained: ‘Through my pregnancy I kept telling myself I would stop. But without it I was a wreck. I needed it to get through the day. 'It was only then that the gravity hit me because the drugs had kept me numb. When I saw my baby lying in hospital I broke down. Ms Casey, pictured with daughter Georgia is now helps other young people who are addicts . ‘I had been kidding myself that I could be an addict and a good mum, but I had failed my children in every sense.’ She fell pregnant again with her ex partner, but still managed to stay clean and left him a year later. She then met her husband and has had another three children. She is proud never to have touched drugs again and recently admitted the truth about their childhood to her children . Ms Casey, who now works as a peer mentor advisor helping other young addicts said: ‘Thankfully I am here to tell them the story. It could have been very different as what may have happened to Peaches shows. ‘They were very shocked but very understanding and supportive. I have raised lovely compassionate children and only hope my story helps others get help before it’s too late.’","Corraine Casey, 35, started using heroin while she had two young children .

Motorcyclist Greg Edwards narrowly escaped with his life when a driver who ran a red light hit him, catapulting him into the air and crushing his leg at a Colorado intersection. But two years after the horror crash, the 53-year-old's leg hasn't fully healed and will be amputated 'two inches from the knee'. Rather than blame the young driver or feel sorry for himself, the Navy veteran hopes his story will inspire other motorists to take care on the road. 'I’m not going to hold a grudge against anybody.

"By . Wills Robinson . They were just five-months old when their mother made the heartbreaking decision to put them up for adoption in 1936. Twins Ann Hunt and Elizabeth Hamel were then separated and faced the prospect of never seeing each other again. But 78 years later the sisters found each other by chance and have reunited. Ann from Aldershot, Hampshire, didn’t even know she had a sibling until her daughter Samantha Stacey discovered Elizabeth while tracing their family tree. Scroll down for video . Moment: Ann Hunt and Elizabeth Hamel were reunited in Los Angeles, California, for the first time since 1936 . Elizabeth, who always knew she had a twin but had given up hope of ever finding her, had moved to Portland, Oregon, USA. They have now earned a place in the Guinness Book Of World Records as the longest time apart for reunited twins after their emotional reunion in Los Angeles, California. During their time apart, they have survived a World War, raised a family and have witnessed the birth of their grandchildren. Ann said: 'I was over the moon, I couldn’t speak. I let Elizabeth speak mostly, I had to pinch myself because I realised that I’ve got a sibling, a sister. 'It’s so wonderful I’m not on my own any more. I’ve got no words to say. I’m so happy - I have Elizabeth.' Elizabeth . added: 'I’ve been praying for her for many years. I thought - being . adopted, she could be anywhere in the world. It was amazing to me that . she was still in Aldershot.' The girls were born out of wedlock in Aldershot and their mother Alice Patience Lamb couldn’t cope and both were to be adopted. But domestic servant Alice couldn’t find anyone to adopt Elizabeth, because she had a curvature of the spine. Ann was given up and she stayed in Aldershot all her life - unaware of who her mother was and that she had a twin. Elizabeth stayed with her mother and later moved to Chester and then to the States when she got married. Elizabeth, who is older than her twin . by 20 minutes, said: 'I had curvature of the spine, which in those days . was something which made a person unadoptable. 'We were both going to be adopted but when mother found out about the curvature of the spine, she decided to keep me.' ...'It’s so wonderful I’m not on my own any more. I’ve got no words to say. I’m so happy' Ann Hunt . The . pair got in touch after Samantha spent hundreds of hours tracing . through birth records trying to find out details about her mum. Samantha, 43, scoured local records for weeks, until eventually she discovered her grandmother’s name, Alice Lamb. Last . April, she then worked out that Alice had had a daughter, who lived in . America, after tracking down her stepson, who lived in Chester. Ann said: 'Samantha said to me ""we’ve found your sister but there’s a bonus - she’s your twin sister.""' Samantha added: 'She was overjoyed - delighted. She instantly rang my sisters. She’s just very happy about it.' They could not find a phone number but did have an address and Ann wrote a letter to her long-lost sister. Elizabeth . said: 'When I saw the letter, my eyes popped open. I couldn’t get on . the phone to give my long-lost sister a call fast enough.' Hug: They were separated at seven-months old but found each other when Elizabeth began tracing the family tree . After a year of talking over the the phone the pair were reunited. Their trip was funded by twin expert Dr Nancy Segal, Director of the Twin Studies Center (corr) at California State University. She is now spending two days studying the pair, who beat the previous world record for separated twins by three years. Dr Segal said: 'Fascinating work on separated twins shows that here are twins growing up in totally different families, sometimes even totally different cultures, and yet they bring with them similar types of attitudes - in politics, religion, social behaviour. 'Where do these things come from? It’s difficult to know exactly but it seems that their genes linked to intelligence, personality and temperament just lead them to have similar types of world views.' While former printer Ann stayed in Aldershot her entire life, Elizabeth joined the Navy, where she met Jim - who sadly passed away in 2012 after 48 years of marriage. The sisters may have only just met for the first time in decades, but it seems they have formed an unbreakable friendship. Ann added: 'I feel like I’ve known Liz all my life now.' Ann raised three daughters, Suzanne Trusler, 51, Sarah, 47, and Samantha Stacey, 43. Elizabeth Hamel raised two boys, one named Quinton, who both joined the navy like their mum.","Ann Hunt from Aldershot, Hampshire, did not know she had a twin .

"By . David Mccormack . A 21-year-old woman who tweeted '2 drunk 2 care' hours before she killed two young women in a wrong-way car crash on a Florida highway has told Inside Edition that she is sorry for what she did and that she doesn't remember anything about the incident. Kayla Mendoza was hit earlier this month with eight charges including DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide for killing Kaitlyn Ferrante and Marisa Catronio, both 21, in a head-on crash last November. ‘When I found out that not only did I get into an accident, but the two girls I got into an accident had passed away, it just really made me wonder why I didn't too,’ a tearful Mendoza told Inside Edition on Wednesday.

As well as the ‘2 drunk 2 care’ tweet sent just hours before the crash, she had also referred to herself as the ‘Pothead Princess’ and fired off dozens of tweets about being high and rolling joints. In the days leading up to wreck, she bragged about her car ‘permanently’ smelling of weed and claimed she was unable to sleep without smoking a ‘bedtime blunt.’ In her interview with Inside Edition, Mendoza said her notorious ‘2 drunk 2 care’ tweet had been directed at her boyfriend, who she had fallen out with.

That's the only person that it was for.’ On . the night of the incident Mendoza was found to have a blood-alcohol . level of 0.15, she was just 20 at the time and had been out boozing . with co-workers from her T-Mobile sales job.

Earlier . this month, she was wheeled into Broward County Jail, Florida, on a . stretcher, covering her face with a sheet while the victims' families . gathered outside the gates. Mendoza, who is still recovering from her injuries from the crash, covered her face so she would not have to look at the faces of the grieving families who gathered on Monday at the Florida jail .

William and Harry were part of a party of 175 guests of Pelly and Wilson, who were seated in an upstairs room of the restaurant. The guests were served ribs, chicken, and sausage and cheese plates. Restaurant owner John Vergos told USA Today the guests appeared to enjoy the meal and that 'a lot of the British like Jack Daniels'. 'Everybody complimented us on the food ... We've been able to feed the presidents and now we feed Prince Harry and Prince William, so it's pretty cool.' A few hours later the party were seen leaving the restaurant, which is just a short distance from the Peabody hotel, though it was unclear where they planned to head next. The princes and their royal cousins are planning to take in a visit to Gracelands - the Memphis estate that belonged to king of rock and roll Elvis Presley - on Friday.

"By . Paul Donnelley . NASA has released a photograph that appears to show huge fires raging across North Korea. The pictures show large plumes of smoke over the east and southeast of Kim Jong-un’s state. Some of the fires are apparently in farm areas and it is possible that the fires may have been set deliberately by farmers to aid in the fertilisation of the soil. This photograph taken by a NASA satellite clearly shows plumes of smoke wafting over over the east and southeast of Kim Jong-Un¿s state . Others are in forests which means that they could be wildfires such as those that at times plague southern California and Australia or they could have been started by damaged power cables. ‘Collectively, the fires were producing enough smoke to send plumes of haze drifting east over the Sea of Japan,’ NASA said on its website. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (right) appearing unconcerned by the fires raging his country inspects a newly built workers' hostel in Pyongyang earlier this week . The . pictures come a month after North Korea launched its own space agency . NADA and has ‘borrowed’ the logo from its American counterpart. The images were taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua satellite, earlier this week. North Korea has launched a remarkable attack on the United States three months after its human rights abuses were exposed by the United Nations (UN). According to the UN, North Korea is committing human rights violations ‘without any parallel in the contemporary world’. In response, the secretive state has issued its own report claiming that the United States and its allies were running a ‘human rights racket’ and demanding to know how a homosexual could lead an investigation into human rights. (Michael Kirby, an openly gay former Justice of the High Court of Australia, led a three-member UN panel that spent a year investigating abuses in the country.) Now the Korean Central News Agency has published an article entitled News Analysis on Poor Human Rights Records in US . It claimed that America has racial discrimination, unemployment, surveillance and poverty concluding ‘The US is the world's worst human right abuser and tundra of a human being's rights to existence’. It alleged: ‘The US is a living hell as elementary rights to existence are ruthlessly violated. ‘The number of impoverished people increased to 46.5 million last year, and one sixth of the citizens and 20-odd percent of the children are in the grip of famine in New York City. ‘All sorts of crimes rampant in the US pose a serious threat to the people's rights to existence and their inviolable rights. ‘The US government has monitored every movement of its citizens and foreigners, with many cameras and tapping devices and even drones involved, under the pretext of ""national security"".‘ .","Fires could be caused by farmers fertilising land or poor infrastructure .

"By . Sean Poulter . Cadbury is launching a chocolate bar aimed at women in an attempt to win back lost sales among the diet-conscious. The Crispello is the first new chocolate bar launched by the company since the 1990s and will be backed by a £7million advertising campaign. Industry research shows that annual sales of single chocolate bars have fallen by some 6.6 per cent in a market worth around £800million a year. Revenge is sweet: Cadbury hope the Crispello chocolate bar will reverse falling sales, especially among women . Evidence suggests that this slump is almost entirely caused by women buying  less chocolate. Cadbury, owned by American food company Kraft, believes the Crispello will particularly appeal to women who are worried about putting on weight. The new bar comes in at 165 calories, compared with 260 for a Mars bar. The Crispello, which is similar in taste and consistency to Ferrero Rocher chocolates, has three chocolate-covered wafer shells with a soft milk chocolate filling. It is designed with a resealable pack so it can be eaten one piece at a time. The Crispello will be sold under the slogan ‘A little treat for you’, on the basis that women can enjoy it without feeling guilty. The strategy of designing a chocolate bar specifically for one gender over another seems something of a throwback to the 1980s. Guilt free: Cadbury hopes that women will be allured by the fact that the new chocolate bar has almost 100 less calories than a 260 calorie Mars bar . The popular Yorkie bars were advertised then under the enduring slogan ‘It’s not for girls’ and featured manly truck drivers biting into the thick chunks. Brand manager at Kraft Foods, Toby Smart, said: ‘Crispello is a lighter way to enjoy the nation’s favourite chocolate taste.’ Earlier this year, Kraft rival Mars launched Galaxy Flutes in the UK, which is being sold as a lighter on-the-go chocolate snack. A Cadbury spokesman said: ‘The mix of wafer and chocolate is a lighter way to eat chocolate and we know from experience that women are attracted to this particular format. ‘It will also appeal to women because it is in three separate portions so they can consume a little at a time rather than in one go.’ The 30g bar will go on sale on October 8 with a recommended price of 50p.","Research suggest the drop in sales is due to women buying less chocolate .

And previously, the NBA had sued Sterling to block his proposal to move the team from San Diego to Los Angeles. But much of the controversy revolved around the taped speech he made, the Los Angeles Times reported. Sterling said at the time that the . remarks were misunderstood. The NBA, however, fined him $10,000 and, . when the committee met, it listened to recordings of the luncheon. But an NBA source told the newspaper 32 years ago: 'He's as good as gone.'

A dog with an irrational fear of the outside which was so bad he didn’t leave his home for a year has finally been on his first walk. Eighteen-month-old chocolate Labrador Jack was terrified of going outside and was so scared he would physically shake, cry and even play dead to avoid leaving his house. But thanks to a dog psychologist, Jack has managed to overcome his fear and has finally been able to go on his first walk. Jack had stayed indoors ever since he . was puppy and had neven been for a walk, despite how much his worried . owner, Judy Huddleston, 42, tried to coax him outside. The . only fresh air Jack would get is when he went to relieve himself in a . small patch of his back garden. Aside from that he stayed indoors. Eventually . after consultation with a dog-whisperer, the family deployed some . smelly cheese to coax the dog through the front door. Mrs . Huddleston, from Melton Mowbray, Leics, said: 'We don’t know what . caused Jack’s phobia, but we think he was spooked by something when he . was a young puppy. 'When . we would try and take Jack outside he would be visibly distressed. He . would cling to the wall and refuse to move, while howling and crying. 'The family and I were beside ourselves as we wanted to help Jack get outside but nothing we tried worked.' At first the mother-of-two hoped it was just a phase Jack would grow out of but after a year of Jack staying indoors, she realised his agoraphobia was a serious concern. Before the treatment, Jack, right, refused to leave the front door of the house with owner Judy Huddleston . Eventually, Judy Huddleston sought help from dog-whisperer Lynne Marshall, right, who managed to coax Jack, centre, out of the house with the promise of cheese . She said: 'I tried a puppy trainer and all different family members had a go at helping but nothing would make Jack budge. 'It got to the stage where Jack was petrified of going near the front door. He was growing into a healthy dog and he needed to experience going outside. 'It would break my heart that I couldn’t even take him for a walk. 'He was physically unable to step outside the front door.' Eventually Ms Huddleston So distressed owner Judy decided to call in a 'dog whisperer' - behavioural psychologist Lynne Marshall, 54, from Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. Jack the Lab, pictured, used to play dead in a bid to avoid being taken on walks . Judy Huddleston thought she would never be able to take her dog for a walk until she met Lynne Marshall, who cured Jack in just one hour . Through a combination of dog psychology and careful coaxing, Lynne managed to help Jack break through his phobia, and after just an hour he was bounding around outside for the first time in his life. Mrs Huddleston revealed: 'I was just overjoyed and amazed. Poor Jack was terrified of the outdoor and didn’t dare set foot outside but within just an hour of Lynne working with him he was bounding around outside, acting like a dog. 'It was something I never thought I would see. I was just so proud of Jack.'Ms Marshall, who has worked with dogs her whole life, has been helping dogs to overcome their phobias and anxieties for the past decade with her Love Your Dog Training. She uses her knowledge of animal and human psychology to get into the mindset of both the dog- and the owner. After just one hour's treatment, Jack the Lab, left, was able to go to the park with owner Judy Huddleston, right, for the first time in his 18-month life . Since the treatment, Judy Huddleston said she cannot believe the change this has made to Jack's life . According to Ms Marshall: 'Jack was one of the most extreme cases I have dealt with in terms of anxiety. 'His story really touched my heart and I just thought it was so sad to have a dog that as unable to go outside. 'He was totally restricted to being in the house and had never experienced the sights and smells of going for a walk. Ms Marshall first explained to Ms Huddleston about how her anxiety over Jack being indoors could be picked up by Jack. 'It is as much about training the owner as it is the dog. Dogs are able to pick up human body language and emotions and usually if the owner is stressed out, the dog will be as well.' Judy Huddleston said she 'tried every trick in the book' to get Jack outside, but nothing would work . Ms Marshall had to work to build trust between her and Jack and after a few minutes of petting and playing, she tried to lead him towards the front gate, from the back garden. She said: 'He physically stuck himself to the wall and would not budge, so I knew it was a deep rooted fear that Jack had.' Ms Marshall used her knowledge of the dog's physiology to tempt him outside the front gate with a serving of cheese.' She said: 'Labradors have an incredible sense of smell and I used tiny bits of smelly cheese to interest Jack. 'He was very scent orientated and managed to overcome his fear.' After picking up the scent, the puppy stepped slowly through the front door and along the path to the gate. According to Ms Huddleston: 'I couldn’t believe my eyes. I had tried every trick in the book the get Jack outside, including tempting him with treats but Lynne had a hypnotic way of talking to Jack and using the cheese to encourage him. 'It was fantastic to see Jack suddenly sniffing around outside the way a dog should. 'Jack now has a whole new lease of life and we couldn’t be happier.'","Jack the Lab refused to leave the house as he was afraid of open spaces .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Irina Abramovich, 46, was dressed smartly in black trousers, a black leather jacket and an orange scarf as she was spotted shopping in Chelsea, south-west London . The ex-wife of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has been spotted out and about for the first time since her estimated £150million divorce from the Chelsea FC owner. Irina Abramovich, 46, was dressed smartly in black trousers, a black leather jacket and an orange scarf as she was spotted shopping in Chelsea, south-west London, today. The former Russian air stewardess married billionaire Abramovich in October 1991 but they divorced almost 16 years later in 2007 - in a divorce settlement said to be in the region of £150million. Although details of the ‘quickie’ divorce in Moscow have been kept hidden under Russia’s secretive legal system, it is thought Irina was left with a lump sum as well as four homes. She supposedly won the £18 million Fyning Hill Estate in Petersfield, West Sussex, which was Abramovich's main base in the UK as well as two of the pair’s London homes at Eaton Square and Chester Square. The Chelsea FC owner is also said to have agreed to pay for the couple's five children; Anna, Arkady, Sonya, Arina and Ilya. The settlement is a marked contrast to the divorce settlement with his first wife, Olga – who he married in January 1988. She claims he left her with a two-bedroom flat in Moscow and just enough money to live on for two years when they split in 1989. Abramovich is now said to own dozens of properties including nine flats in Lowndes Square, Kensington, which he plans to turn into a 30,000 sq. ft. house, as well as a mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens – which he bought for a reported £90million – and a home in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea.

He also owns two houses in the Caribbean, a ranch in Colorado, a house just outside Moscow, and the £250million New Holland island off St Petersburg. He also owns two planes – a Boeing 767 and 737 – three helicopters, a customised Ferrari, two Maybach limousines, a Porsche Carrera, a Rolls-Royce Corniche and a VW Golf, as well as at least three supersize yachts. Following his two failed marriages, the Russian oligarch is now dating 32-year-old Dasha Zhukova – whose real name is Daria.

The Moscow-born beauty, who is editor-in-chief of bi-annual art and fashion magazine Garage, has two children with Abramovich  - Aaron Alexander, born 3 December 2009 and Leah Lou, born 15 April 2013. Abramovich met Dasha  - the daughter of Russian businessman Alexander Zhukova - at a New Year's Eve party hosted by her father in 2006.

"By . Associated Press . Rusty the red panda's escape from a Washington D.C. zoo last month has prompted a new plan to inspect trees, bushes and other vegetation around every exhibit at the National Zoo. An investigation determined Rusty likely climbed out through the trees in his exhibit. Now the limbs have been cut back, and the zoo has two cameras aimed at the red panda yard around the clock. Walkabout: Rusty the red panda, pictured, went missing from the zoo in Washington D.C in June . According to a zoo report on the . escape obtained by The Associated Press following a public records . request, the zoo has been investigating and observing Rusty ever since . he was found in a nearby Washington neighborhood June 24. The report was filed with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, an accrediting body. The . zoo's investigation found Rusty likely escaped late June 23 or early . June 24 through tree limbs hanging low in his exhibit after a rain. No red panda tracks were found outside the exhibit, the report noted, so the exact route of his escape couldn't be determined. Animal keepers have kept watch on Rusty's activity by day and night as an extra precaution. He . returned to his public exhibit July 9 and spent the night outside for . the first time Monday night with two keepers on duty to observe his . behavior. Home: Rusty, pictured, returned from his trip to the Adams Morgan neighborhood and went back to his enclosure (pictured getting a check up in June) Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, a spokeswoman said. 'We identified and solved the problem that allowed Rusty to get out,' the report noted. As of July 1, 'we are confident that the exhibit can contain him.' The . incident prompted the zoo to begin regular checks of all vegetation . around enclosures to ensure animal containment is secure. There has been increased trimming throughout the zoo, said spokeswoman Pamela Baker-Masson. The . U.S. Department of Agriculture sent an inspector to the zoo following . the escape, and a copy of the brief inspection report was provided to . the AP. On June 27, veterinarian Gloria McFadden found 'an appropriate corrective action plan' had been developed following the escape. Rusty was born in July 2012 at the Lincoln Children's Zoo in Lincoln, Neb. Found: Ashley Foughty took this picture of Rusty scurrying in the bushes and tweeted it to the zoo with a note saying 'Red panda in our neighborhood. Please come save him!' He . was transferred to the National Zoo in April under breeding . recommendations from the zoos association. He was moved into his exhibit . in June after time in quarantine. Less than a month later, the young, curious male was found exploring his new city in the Adams Morgan neighborhood. Residents . snapped pictures of him along sidewalks and homes before zoo keepers . cornered him in a tree and snagged him a net nearly ¾ of a mile from the . zoo. Following the escape, the zoo has removed bamboo — a favorite food for red pandas — around the red panda exhibit. The plants had grown high and likely helped create a 'vegetative bridge' out of the enclosure. The idea of a snack may have drawn Rusty out for a treat, the report noted. 'Horticulture . staff regularly trim vegetation in animal habitats to make sure . containment is not compromised,' said Baker-Masson, the zoo's . spokeswoman. 'In this case, zoo staff underestimated the growth brought about by perfect weather conditions (weeks of consistent rain).' Code Green: Officials at the zoo, pictured, sounded the 'Code Green' alert for an escaped animal when they noticed Rusty missing in June . Hotwire . lines that carry an electric current in the enclosure also were . assessed and upgraded. A new visitor wall was added to create more . tree-free space. According . to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums guidelines for red pandas, . enclosures must be created with the species' mobility in mind. 'Red . pandas are excellent climbers, but poor jumpers, so dry-moated . enclosures contain them well,' according to an excerpt from the . association's manual in the zoo's report. 'Do not let the branches of climbing trees overhang the boundary fence.' It . hasn't been determined if hotwire is an effective barrier, but it is . sometimes used to keep wildlife from entering the exhibit. Hotwire should be considered a secondary barrier, according to the zoo association. The . National Zoo uses hotwire throughout the zoo as a deterrent in . conjunction with walls, fences or other barriers, Baker-Masson said. Unlike giant pandas, red pandas are not members of the bear family. They . are slightly larger than a domestic cat and look similar to a raccoon. Red pandas are vulnerable in the wild and are native to Asia. Scientists believe about 10,000 of them remain.","Rusty the red panda disappeared from his enclosure at the Smithsonian National zoo in June .

"By . Meghan Keneally . A New Jersey man has been found guilty of the involuntary manslaughter of his ex-girlfriend and been sentenced to spend up to 20 years behind bars. Michael Morrone was charged on Wednesday with the third degree murder of Christine McGhee after a December 2008 incident left her in a vegetative state. McGhee was a sophomore at Kutztown University in Bucks County, Pennsylvania and she was drunk at a party when she called her ex, Morrone, to come get her. Convicted again: Michael Morrone, now 26, had previously been charged with aggravated assault in connection to the case and now he has been found guilty of manslaughter and third degree murder . Serious injury resulting in death: Christine McGhee was a college sophomore and was left in a vegetative state (right) following the December 2008 incident . WFMZ reports that witnesses saw the pair arguing as they drove off from the party. Further into the drive, Morrone pushed McGhee out of the cab of his pickup truck and threw her cell phone and bag after her. McGhee then gained her footing on the running board- the slight step off the side of the truck- and Morrone purposefully sped up causing her to fly off and hit her head. The prosecution argued that he knew she was injured but he decided to drive away and flee the scene. Big fight: Christine was drunk at a party and called her ex-boyfriend, Morrone, to come pick her up and friends recalled seeing them arguing as they drove off . Prosecutors argued that he wanted to speed away to get rid of McGhee, not simply go home. She broke her jaw and was left in a vegetative state as a result of the accident for more than three years and died in 2012. The coroner ruled that her March 2012 death came as a result of brain injuries sustained in the accident. Morrone, now 26, had previously been convicted of aggravated assault in 2010 in connection to the incident, but this latest verdict came when prosecutors were able to charge him for causing her death. Medical problems: She broke her jaw and suffered brain injuries (pictured in August 2009) after flying off the running board and a coroner ruled that her death in 2012 was a delayed result of the fight . He has already been in jail for the past four years, as he was sentenced to spend between five and 20 years as a result of the aggravated assault conviction. 'Over the past four years, I've had a lot of time to think. Not a day goes by I don't  think about it,' Morrone said in a statement during the sentencing portion of the trial. 'I really wish I would have handled things differently that night. I do want to apologize to Christine's family. I really am sorry. You guys don't deserve that and neither does my family.' He has been sentenced to spend between eight and 20 years in prison.","Michael Morrone has been charged with manslaughter in the March 2012 death of his ex-girlfriend Christine McGhee .

"By . James Rush . A woman who was used as a sex-slave managed to escape her captor and save three other women held by him after she used knotted sheets to climb to safety. Police have hailed the courage of the 29-year-old after she escaped from the flat where she was being held in Irkutsk, a city in the far east of Russia. She was allegedly being held at the second-storey flat, along with three other women, by Emmanuel Maslow, 34, who has been arrested on charges of drug dealing and sex trafficking. A 29-year-old woman is said to have escaped her captor, who kept her and three other women in his flat, by using knotted sheets to climb to safety . She was allegedly being held at the second-storey flat, along with three other women, by Emmanuel Maslow, 34, who has been arrested on charges of drug dealing and sex trafficking . Police said he wanted to create a 'harem' of women. It is claimed he managed to trap her and the other women by meeting them in the city and enticing them back to his flat. The women were allegedly kept in chains at the flat and threatened with death if they made a noise. A security door is said to have prevented the women from escaping and they were allegedly plied with alcohol. The woman who escaped gathered the courage to do so after drinking alcohol, the Central European News agency reported. It is alleged the man managed to trap the women by meeting them in the city and enticing them back to his flat . She knotted sheets together and climbed to safety while her captor was in the kitchen. A police spokesman said: 'We returned to the apartment with her and freed the other terrified women. 'All are getting medical treatment and the man is in custody.' He did not say how long the women had been held but confirmed the man seemed to have planned for them to be there for a long time. He said large quantities of drugs had also been discovered at the flat and that the man faced charges of drug dealing and sex trafficking. Police suspect other people knew that the four women were there and that there were indications he had offered them to clients of his alleged drugs business for sex.","Police hail courage of woman after she escapes from flat in Irkutsk, Russia .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A man who allegedly admitted to molesting his cousin when she was 13 is now suing her for defamation and stalking. James Rashawn Johnson is petitioning for a civil injunction to stop his cousin Ashley Foster using his name or photographs when she tells her story of how she was molested. Foster, 23, claims Johnson molested her for six years until she was 19, but he was never prosecuted because when she reported him two years ago, too much time had passed since the alleged offense. Refusing to back down, Foster launched an online campaign to eliminate Florida's statute of limitations in cases like hers, and used her cousin's name and pictures. Johnson wants her to stop identifying him because he has never been charged. Scroll down for video . Alleged victim: Ashley Foster, 23 (pictured), claims her cousin molested her for six years and has fought to have Florida's statute of limitation for child molestation lifted . Accused: James Rashawn Johnson (pictured left and right), a father, allegedly admitted to molesting his female cousin for six years . 'My picture appeared on Facebook as 'a predator', which I have never been arrested, prosecuted, or convicted of,' he wrote in a statement filed in Broward County court, according to WPTV. Johnson, a father, has not commented publicly on the case. Foster, however, said she refuses to be silenced and would only stop using Johnson's image and name if ordered by a court. 'I felt re-victimized now,' the Boynton Beach woman told WPBF. 'I have a First Amendment right to tell my story. And he made my story.' Her mother, Darlene Foster, added: 'She's not shutting up. She's not going to back down. And that's the Ashley I'm proud of.' Campaign: Ashley Foster created a Facebook page 'Ashley's Law' in October 2013 campaigning for Florida's statute of limitation on child molestation to be eliminated, to enable alleged offenders to be prosecuted . Show of strength: Ashley Foster told her story to Florida legislators in February. In March, 'Ashley's Law' passed, eliminating the state's three-year statute of limitations on child molestation . Foster said she kept her alleged abuse a secret until two years ago because she was afraid of her family's reaction. After telling her mother, she allegedly recorded Johnson admitting his crime and apologizing. She took the recording to Boynton Beach Police who, according to WPTV, had a strong case against Johnson but couldn't prosecute because the statute of limitations had run out just 60 days before. 'I was like, 'Oh, you've got to be kidding me',' Foster said. 'We're going to have to change this.' Last year, she started a Facebook page, Ashley's Law - and an online campaign - to change state law to eliminate the statute of limitations in cases like hers. It worked. Heartbreaking: Ashley Foster, 23 (left) claims she was molested from the age of 13 to 19, but only told her mom Darlene Foster (right) about the alleged abuse two years ago . She told her story to Florida lawmakers who passed the bill, with the governor signing Ashley's Law on April 1. 'She has a right to say his name and talk about it and warn people of it and that's exactly what she did,' Darlene Foster, Ashley's mother, said. But now Johnson claims he is being defamed by the Facebook page and fliers all around his neighborhood and workplace accusing him of molesting his cousin. The court will hear the case next week.","Ashley Foster, 23, claims her cousin James Rashawn Johnson molested her for six years until she was 19 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Embattled Clippers owner Donald Sterling received the SNL treatment in the show's opening gambit. The show, hosted this week by Spiderman actor Andrew Garfield, got straight to the week's big story of Sterling's leaked racist rant and the subsequent fallout in its cold opener. Bobby Moynihan as the octogenarian billionaire insisted that he, in fact, is the real victim in the whole affair. Basketball diary: SNL's skit sees Sterling holding a press conference to redeem himself after racist remarks got him banned from the NBA . 'My reputation has gotten a real black eye, which we all know is the worst kind of eye,' he says in a press conference in which he's apparently trying to redeem himself for the racist comments he was recorded making that were leaked last week. He goes on to say that he intends to use every penny of the $1 billion that he'll earn from the sale of the Clippers to repair his relationship with the black community, especially Magic Johnson, 'who was clearly one of the good ones.' 'So I have been learning about your history,' he says. 'Today, I watched Roots on TV, and let me tell you, that Questlove, very talented, very talented boy.' High achiever: A representative from the LA Chapter of the NAACP appears to award Sterling his second lifetime achievement award . New love: Sterling says far from being racist, he has a new girlfriend who is 'three-quarter black' He then explains that he plans to spend $3 million to take young black men on a cruise to the beautiful Ivory Coast off Africa 'to never come back!' The show made no mention of Sterling's 'personal assistant' V. Stiviano who gave an interview to Barbara Walters on 20/20 last night, but the businessman's love life was fair game. He explains that he has parted ways with his 'half-black mistress Ms Stiviano' and has now taken a mistress who is 'three-quarters black.' 'Listen, I know y'all are like, ""She don't have no dignity!"" Well you know what I do have? A new Lexus convertible!' says 'Kayla,' before describing sex with Sterling as 'like a leather tent's collapsed on me.' Good judge of character: Dennis Rodman says Sterling is one of the greatest men he knows, right up there with Kim Jong Un . The next person to vouch for Sterling is former NBA star Dennis Rodman, who says Sterling is 'a good man,' and that he should know because he is, 'above all, a good judge of character.' 'And this is one of the greatest men I've ever met, right up there with my main man, glorious leader Kim Jong Un,' he says. The LA chapter of the NAACP also came in for a drubbing from SNL for awarding Sterling a Lifetime Achievement award, essentially for giving them a lot of money. The only person, according to the skit, who had a great week during the Sterling controversy, was NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who says, 'I have gotten more high fives from random black people this week than any other week in my life. And I have learned many wonderful new handshakes.'","Saturday Night Live poked fun at Donald Sterling's racism debacle .

"By . Alex Greig . A convicted felon has tweeted his way to an arrest after a police officer began surreptitiously following him on Twitter. Officer Brian Delahunty of the Boston Police Department became one of Kwmaine Davis's 329 follows on Twitter as part of the Youth Violence Strike Force. Davis, 23, is a convicted felon associated with H-Bloc, a gang that operates in Roxbury. Incriminating: A pleased-looking Davis holds two pistols in a photo he posted to Twitter which subsequently got him arrested . Posting as DopeMan @supafreakmaino, Davis shares pictures of food, friends and memes - interspersed with more illicit images. He posted two pictures to the social network in February of himself shooting guns at a firing range. The images, showing Davis with a Smith & Wesson .44 caliber handgun and a Sig Sauer .380 caliber pistol at a Salisbury shooting range, were enough for Delahunty to act. As a convicted felon, Davis is not allowed to possess a firearm - not even, as The Smoking Gun reports, one from a firing range. Delahunty alerted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which initiated a probe into the photographs. A criminal complaint was then filed against Davis for possessing a firearm. A little bird told them: Davis' own Twitter feed got him arrested on weapons charges . Davis was arrested on Wednesday by federal agents and will remain in custody until his hearing on May 9. According to The Smoking Gun, Davis's associated with H-Bloc was reason enough to deny him bail. The H-Block gang, so called because it operates in an area just north of Franklin Park where most of the street names begin with H, is well-known to police. The Smoking Gun reports that its members wear silver and black clothing emblazoned with the Raiders logo. Police say Davis's target practice was 'intended to increase his firearm proficiency for illegal purposes rather than for any sporting or recreational reason.'","Kwmaine Davis, 23, posted pictures of himself on Twitter at a shooting range with a variety of guns .

"By . Lucy Crossley . An Egyptian judge bid a journalist being held on terror charges 'Happy World Press Freedom Day' after the reporter made a desperate plea for freedom from his cage. Mohammed Fahmy is one of three Al-Jazeera journalists being held by the Egyptian authorities after they were charged with altering film footage to support the Muslim Brotherhood. Mr Fhamy, the Canadian-Egyptian acting Al-Jazeera bureau chief, was allowed to leave his cage in the court room and stood directly before the judge's bench as he told the official that journalists have to speak to all sides to do their jobs. Al-Jazeera journalist Mohammed Fahmy (left) was told 'Happy World Press Freedom Day' by judge Mohamed Nagy Shehata (right) as he pleaded to be released on bail . Mohammed Fahmy, former BBC reporter Peter Greste (pictured) and Baher Mohammed are being held by the Egyptian authorities after they were charged with altering film footage to support the Muslim Brotherhood . But his request for bail was unsuccessful, with Judge Mohamed Nagi Shehata refusing to release Mr Fahmy and his fellow Al-Jazeera employees, Baher Mohammed and former BBC reporter Peter Greste. And the judge even wished Mr Fahy a 'happy' World Press Freedom Day as he denied the request. The trio face charges of being part of a terrorist group and airing falsified footage intended to damage Egyptian national security. Egyptian authorities have accused Qatari-owned network Al-Jazeera of providing a platform for the Muslim Brotherhood, which the government has branded a terrorist organisation. Award-winning Australian correspondent Mr Greste (left)  and Egyptian producer Mr Mohamed appear in a defendants' cage in the Police Academy courthouse . Al-Jazeera denies the claim, and the defendants deny being members of the Brotherhood, saying they were simply doing their job reporting on Egypt's political turmoil. They are on trial with 17 others and will next appear before a court on May 15. Last month a judge sentenced 529 people to death for alleged Brotherhood links in a case that was condemned around the world. Amnesty International has condemned the trial as a 'vindictive farce'. Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty’s Middle East and North Africa Programme Deputy Director, said: 'What the Egyptian authorities are doing is vindictive persecution of journalists for merely doing their jobs. The three journalists face charges of being part of a terrorist group and airing falsified footage intended to damage Egyptian national security . The defendants deny being members of the Brotherhood, saying they were simply doing their job reporting on Egypt's political turmoil . 'So far, the Prosecution has failed to produce any convincing evidence and the journalists appear to be pawns in the hands of the authorities in their ongoing dispute with Qatar. 'The truth is that Mohamed Fahmy, Peter Greste and Baher Mohamed are prisoners of conscience who must be released immediately and unconditionally. 'This trial is nothing more than posturing by the authorities to gain public support. 'This farce must end and the charges against the three men must be dropped.' Peter Greste worked for the BBC in Afghanistan, Latin America and Africa, and has won awards for his work. The journalists are on trial with 17 others and will next appear before a court on May 15 . Last month a judge sentenced 529 people to death for alleged Brotherhood links in a case that was condemned around the world . The 45-year-old Australian, who works for Arab TV channel Al Jazeera, describes the charges as ‘preposterous’ and an international campaign has been launched to secure his release. At a previous hearing Mr Greste told the judge he had been in Egypt for only two weeks before his arrest. ‘The idea that I could have an association with the Muslim Brotherhood is frankly preposterous,’ he said. ‘Our only desire at this point is to continue to fight and clear our names from outside of prison.’ Other defendants claimed they had been abused and tortured during interrogation. Mr Greste’s parents had hoped he would be released after Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott took up the case with interim Egyptian President Adly Mansour.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A bear cub that was due to be euthanized after biting 14 Missouri university students last weekend has been saved after those it attacked intervened. Boo Boo the bear was part of an entourage of cuddly young animals brought to Washington University in St Louis to help calm the nerves of students before exams. But the youngster was a bit too rough, and ended up causing fears of a rabies outbreak after nipping some students so hard that it broke their skin. Saved: Boo Boo the bear cub was due to be euthanized after biting 14 Washington University students . Because the two-month-old cub had been born in the wild, the university feared it may have been carrying the deadly virus, but the only way to be sure was to carry out tests after it had been euthanized. When students heard that Boo Boo's life was hanging in the balance however, they pleaded to save the cub's life and offered to have rabies vaccinations themselves rather than let the bear be killed. Student Kaity Cullen told Fox 2: 'I think most people right now are upset because to test the bear they have to euthanize it. 'Even being bitten, I would rather just go get the shots, and that appears to be the overwhelming opinion among the students.' The bear cub was brought to campus last weekend as part of an annual event in which a selection of animals from Cindy's Zoo are made available to students. Boo Boo hadn't been listed on the zoo's website as being among the 'animal friends' taken on the visits, and university officials said they weren't told in advance that a bear would be on campus. Usually, the mobile petting zoo consists of a baby camel, llama, farmyard animals and, occasionally, an armadillo. Best behavior: Boo Boo looks like the perfect guest as he is fed by a student at Washington University last weekend .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Floyd Mayweather has opened up about his decision to post a picture of his ex's sonogram and publicly claim that she aborted their unborn twins, saying that at first he was trying to defend her. Mayweather said that his ex, Shantel Jackson, had told him that she had a miscarriage because of stress that he caused, and for some unknown reason he felt the need to make it clear that she did have a miscarriage. According to TMZ, he told radio station V-103 that after he said he was going to post the photo, representatives from a reality show she had been working on for Showtime contacted him and revealed the truth. Outrageous: Floyd Mayweather posted this photo of a sonogram- the details of which have been blurred by MailOnline but states that it shows multiple fetuses- and he claimed that it was that of his ex Shantel Jackson . 'Somebody from Showtime contacted me and said ""Floyd, I'm glad you didn't put that picture out there because she didn't have a miscarriage. She had an abortion,""' the undefeated boxer said in an interview Friday. 'But I feel bad because she was telling me the whole time that basically stress from me made her have a miscarriage but all in all, she went and got an abortion.' From there, he went on to make further claims about her alleged motivations and the supposed plastic surgery that he paid for while they were together for four years prior to their split in April. 'It hurt my feelings all because she's selfish because all she's worried about is looks, talking about ""I don't want to mess my body up."" Everything you got on your body, I paid for so it's okay. Even if you had the baby- even if you had the babies, if you wanted me to put you back together like I did in the beginning, I could've done it again,' he said. Retaliation: Jackson promptly posted this photo of her and Nelly, effectively confirming that they are in the beginning of a relationship which had been rumored in the days leading up to Mayweather's posting of the sonogram . Bitter punch: Mayweather responded to the Nelly pictured by posting this undated shot of Jackson- before taking it down . Pointed response: Jackson posted this clear message on Thursday afternoon . 'I'm all like ""everything you got on you is fake,"" you know you got a fake butt, you've got fake titties, you got work done on your face. ‘That's how you know my love was genuine because I accepted you from the heart: no breasts, no butt, no face work. I accepted you because it was real love. Pure love.' In conclusion, he declared that it was never his intention to bring this up publicly, even though he was the one that planned to confirm the 'miscarriage' in the first place. 'My whole outlook from the beginning was that I think your private life should be private,' he told the radio show. The scandal began Thursday when Mayweather posted his ex-fiancée’s alleged sonogram and claimed that he broke up with her because she got an abortion.

Sparking rumors: Nelly brought Shantel Jackson to the Charlotte Bobcats game against the Miami Heat on Monday, which was their first public outing amid speculation of their relationship . Causing speculation: Jackson posted this cryptic Twitter message after being spotted at the game in Charlotte . The World Champion boxer posted the photo of the sonogram to his Facebook and Instagram accounts Wednesday before receiving thousands of negative comments and taking it down.

"By . Darren Boyle . Hundreds of Sinn Fein supporters took to the streets of Belfast to protest against the continuing detention of their leader Gerry Adams. The 65-year-old politician is being questioned in connection by the PSNI in connection with the 1972 kidnap and murder of mother-of-ten Jean McConville. However, republicans in Northern Ireland believe that the arrest is politically motivated and designed to disrupt SInn Fein's local and European election campaign in the Irish Republic. Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness addresses the crowd on the Falls Road in Belfast where he claimed that the arrest of his party colleague was 'politically motivated' Thousands of Sinn Fein supporters turned up to the unveiling of the mural to Gerry Adams on the nationalist Falls Road in Belfast who is currently being questioned by PSNI detectives . Protesters held placards with a photograph of Mr Adams with Nelson Mandella under the banner 'defend the peace process' The rally on the nationalist Falls Road was to unveil a mural of the Sinn Fein president as a 'peacemaker'. The mural was painted during the week as PSNI detectives continue to question Mr Adams in connection with the murder. Addressing the crowd, Mr McGuinness said this week represented the 'dark side' of policing. He said: 'These people want to settle old scores whatever the political cost'. Mr Adams strenuously denies any involvement in the abduction and murder of Mrs McConville, who was taken from her Belfast home after being accused of being an informer. A young child holds a photograph of the Sinn Fein leader at the rally unveiling a mural for Gerry Adams . Her body was buried on a beach in Co Louth in the Irish Republic where it was recovered in 2003. However, this week's developments have threatened the continuing success of the peace process with Sinn Fein threatening to withdraw support from the PSNI if Mr Adams is charged with any crime. Mr McGuinness said: 'We worked very hard to reform policing. Sinn Fein's negotiations strategy succeeded in achieving new policing arrangements but we always knew that there remained with the PSNI an embittered rump of the old RUC (Royal Ulster Constabulary). 'No police force is immune from criticism if it is acting in a politically biased and partisan fashion. 'The . arrest of Gerry Adams is evidence that there is an element within the . PSNI who are against the peace process and who hate Gerry Adams and Sinn . Fein. 'They are what the reformers within the PSNI have described to us as the dark side. 'They . are small in number but very influential. This group is working to a . negative and anti-peace process agenda and are actively involved in . political policing. Sinn Fein's allegations have been dismissed by Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson, Justice Minster David Ford and the Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers. Mr Forde described the arrest as 'entirely appropriate'. Mr McGuinness described Mr Adams as 'his leader' and 'his friend' while addressing the crowd on the Falls Road in Belfast . The crowd gathered in Belfast after Mr Adams spent a third night in custody in connection with the murder investigation . Mr McGuinness told the assembled crowd that case against Mr Adams is based on 'hearsay, gossip and newspaper articles' Mr McGuinness told supporters: 'In my view this is a failed attempt at the replay of the effort in 1978 to charge Gerry Adams with membership of the IRA. That case was based on hearsay, gossip and newspaper articles. It failed then and it will fail now. 'Thirty-six years later those within the PSNI who are hostile to the peace process are using the same old dirty tricks. They are deliberately and cynically exploiting the awful killing of Jean McConville and the grief and hurt inflicted on her family. There is a small cabal in the PSNI who have a different agenda, a negative and destructive agenda to both the peace process and Sinn Fein. 'We under the leadership of Gerry Adams will not allow this element to succeed. 'Gerry Adams is my friend, Gerry Adams is the leader of Sinn Fein and, in my opinion, Gerry Adams stands head and shoulders above all of those who helped build this peace process.'

"By . Lydia Warren . A touching video has shown the moment a 12-year-old dog who spent her entire life locked in a tiny cage has felt grass beneath her paws for the first time. The footage shows Lizzy the Maltese stepping apprehensively across the grass weeks after she was rescued from an enclosure no bigger than 18 inches by 18 inches. Until she was saved by the National Mill Dog Rescue in March, Lizzy had spent her life locked in the cage at a puppy mill in Arkansas, never leaving the confines of its four walls to play or run. Apprehensive: Lizzy, a 12-year-old Maltese dog who spent her entire life in a tiny cage at a puppy mill in Arkansas, is filmed trying to walk across grass for the first time in a touching video . Getting there: Lizzy looks uncertain as she stumbles across grass after being rescued in March . So it is unsurprising that the video shows how she is overwhelmed by the experience as she apprehensively sniffs the ground and wobbles from paw to paw. But in another video taken by her new owner just weeks later, Lizzy is seen full of life and leaping across the grass as she revels in her freedom. She has just a right eye as veterinarians were forced to remove her left one when it was found swollen and infected. She also had several tumors removed. 'When we brought her in, she was terrified,' the Rescue's media officer, Michele Burchfield, said. 'These dogs know nothing of human touch. Saved: An image shows Lizzy shortly after she was found. She went on to have her infected left eye removed . 'The video is very cute and sweet but it's also very poignant because it reveals what these dogs have been through.' She added that after Lizzy received medical care, she was put into a foster home in Colorado. In what the Rescue jokingly call a 'foster failure', the foster parents adored her so much that they decided to adopt her, and she is now going from strength to strength. 'She's actually doing really well and looking much healthier,' Burchfield said. 'She's running about and is used to the grass. She's a lovely dog.' Burchfield added that puppy mills are entirely legal and the dogs' treatment and cage sizes follow strict U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines. On the mend: Lizzy, who is going from strength to strength, is pictured at bedtime at her new home . Happier times: In another video taken weeks later, Lizzy is seen hopping across the grass with ease . But while it may be above board, she added that many pet owners are unaware that their puppies have been born to mothers living in such heart-wrenching conditions. 'People don't understand the puppies in some pet stores are coming from these places,' she said. 'If you can't see the homes and see a loving environment then look elsewhere. 'Twenty-five per cent of all dogs in shelters are pure breeds, so even though it might take a bit of time, I would tell people to look around shelters instead of going to pet stores that sell puppies.' Puppy mills contact the Rescue when they . have dogs which are no longer of breeding age, and the group will rescue . them. Burchfield added that other mills simply euthanize the dogs. The Rescue takes in around 60 to 100 dogs a month and takes them to their shelter in Peyton, Colorado, where they stay until they are adopted or put into foster homes.

"A California jury reached a mixed verdict Friday in the second round of patent infringement litigation between tech giants Apple and Samsung, awarding Apple a fraction of the amount asked of the jury while awarding an even smaller amount to Samsung's counterclaim. The eight-person jury returned a verdict finding that Samsung had infringed on two Apple software patents, awarding the company a total of $119.6 million. The jury also found in favor of Samsung in their counterclaim, awarding them $158,400 for the infringement of one patent. The $119.6 million is barely more than five per cent of the $2.2 billion in damages Apple asked of the court. It is also much less than the $930 million Apple was awarded in 2012 in the same court, the US District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Jose. A jury returned a verdict in the Apple v. Samsung patent infringement case Friday, awarding Apple $119.6 million for their damages . Boxes of documents shown outside of the federal courthouse in San Jose, California, on April 28, 2014. The jury heard four weeks of trial before deliberating on a verdict . In this litigation, Apple accused Samsung of 'slavishly' lifting numerous technologies from the iPhone for use in Samsung's product line. The jury was asked to decide on five patents, deciding that all Samsung phones infringed on Apple's 'quick links' patent, while only some of Samsung's phones infringed on Apple's 'slide-to-lock' patent. US District Judge Lucy Koh had previously ruled on a motion for summary judgment that some of Samsung's phones infringed on Apple's 'auto-correct' patent. Two other patents, including background syncing and unified search, were not found to be infringed upon by Samsung. In addition, the jury found that Apple infringed one of Samsung's patents. The four man, four woman jury deliberated for three days following a four week trial. At trial Apple characterized Samsung as thieves, with Apple attorney Harold McElhinny telling the court that Samsung's 'illegal strategy has been wildly successful.' Samsung's counsel disputed this claim, arguing that Apple was simply trying to attack another nemesis, Google, by preventing the the sale of products like the Galaxy S3, which use Google's Android operating system. According to Samsung, the lawsuit was part of Apple's 'holy war' against Google, declared by the late Steve Jobs in response his belief that Android ripped off Apple's iOS. 'They want to attack Google and Android by attacking the most successful Android maker,' said attorney John Quinn in Samsung's closing arguments. Speculation has arisen that the court's verdict proved to be favorable to both Samsung and Google. Not only did Apple again fail to obtain a court injunction preventing Samsung from selling their allegedly infringing phones in the United States, but the two patents in which Google had agreed to indemnify Samsung (the background syncing and unified search) were not found to be infringing by the jury. Some experts claim that the jury's verdict was favorable to not only Samsung, but Google as well. Apple maintains that they are glad to prevail in the jury's verdict . The $119.6 million awarded by the jury will likely not be the final total. In a review after the verdict was returned, Apple lawyers noticed an error with the way the jury made one calculation, forgetting to assess damages for one Samsung product that was found to infringe an Apple patent. Apple attorneys Harold McElhinny (pictured left) and William Lee (pictured right) walk in to a federal courthouse in San Jose, California, on April 28, 2014. Apple prevailed on three claims of patent infringement against Samsung. The jury will return on Monday at 9am to assess this oversight. The additional amount the jury will add to the verdict will not change the general result of the case for Apple. Despite the jury's award being significantly less than what they asked for, attorneys for Apple maintained satisfaction regarding winning in some capacity. 'We are grateful to the jury and the court for their service,' a representative for Apple told Re/code. 'Todayâ€™s ruling reinforces what courts around the world have already . found: That Samsung willfully stole our ideas and copied our products. We are fighting to defend the hard work that goes into beloved products . like the iPhone, which our employees devote their lives to designing and . delivering for our customers.' Both sides will likely file post-trial motions in the coming weeks, and may appeal the result depending on how the court rules. Samsung is still appealing the 2012 ruling in which they were ordered to pay Apple $930 million. This litigation is the latest in an ongoing legal war the tech giants have been locked in, spanning worldwide. This verdict comes when the two have begun to experience stalling in what was unprecedented growth. Both companies have been losing market share.  Two . years ago, Apple and Samsung accounted for more than 55 per cent of world-wide . smartphones shipments, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. In . the first quarter of 2104, that number has fallen to 47 per cent. According to the study, smaller Chinese rivals upstarts such as Huawei and Lenovo have been making gains, with a Lenovo takeover of Motorola pending in several countries.","Jury found in favor of Apple on three claims of patent infringement .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A recently hired PayPal executive went on an ill-advised Twitter rant early Saturday morning cursing out colleagues and calling them ‘useless.’ Rakesh ‘Rocky’ Agrawal took less than two months to begin bashing his new colleagues after the company hired him as director of strategy – and then he blamed it on not knowing how to use an Android phone. The vitriolic, spelling error-riddled tweeting began around 1.00 a.m. and ended with him saying he quit the firm. Outspoken: PayPal director of strategy Rakesh Agrawal bashed colleagues over Twitter just after 1.00 a.m. Saturday morning . Beginning of the end: The weekend started innocently enough . Rocky’s first victim was Christina Smedley, PayPal's vice president of global communications. 'Duck you Smedley you useless middle. manager,’ he tweeted. ‘Christina Smedley is a useless. Piece of s**t.’ He then incoherently called for the head of a previously unknown employee. ‘People who should be fire from paypal Don Christmas a pool a kick.’ The tech industry veteran then claimed he could make Foursquare a $50billion company. ‘I can turn foursquare into a $50 bill OK n company let’s chat,’ he tweeted. Take that!: Agrawal started his profane ranting by sticking up his middle finger . Not a fan: His ranting began against Christina Smedley .

The outspoken executive then woke up in the morning and claimed to be thirsty. ‘Hydrate.’ He then quickly deleted the offending tweets and publicly apologized to PayPal president David Marcus and vice president of growth and global strategy Stan Chudnovsky. His mea culpa was followed by the following tweet. ‘Day one of my next adventure? I am so ducking tired.’ Rocky then claimed the messages were . meant for a colleague and that he did not realize were tweets instead of . direct messages – DMs are private. Right after he woke up: Rocky appears to be dehydrated . The apology: Agrawal apologized to multiple PayPal executives shortly after deleting the offending tweets . The explanation: He blamed android's Twitter interface . Moving on: Agrawal wrapped up his reaction to his bizarre ranting by poking fun at himself . He also blamed his new Android phone, saying he did not know how to use it. ‘The twitter interface on android and gs5 is shockingly different from iPhone, said the first explanatory tweet. ‘Last night I was using a new phone that I bought because I wanted to test experiences on android. Those messages were meant for a colleague,’ said the second. This is not the first time Rocky has been critical of the company. Last year he wrote an op-ed for industry site VentureBeat calling its point-of-sale service allowing customers at cash registers to use PayPal to buy groceries a 'piece of s**t.'

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A Tough Mudder race that involves a military style obstacle course in muddy waters may send participants right to the bathroom line as the CDC warned yesterday that competitors are at risk for developing bloody and explosive diarrhea. After a Tough Mudder race in 2012 in Nevada, public health officials at Nellis Air Force Base outside Las Vegas got a call from their medical center's emergency department who said that three members of the active-duty military were vomiting and experienced bloody diarrhea.All three of them said that they had fallen face first in mud during a Tough Mudder obstacle at a cattle ranch in the town of Beatty, reports The Atlantic. Brandon Arellano hits the mud during the 'Tough Mudder' obstacle course event in San Bernardino, California  similar to the event in Nevada where many participants became ill with bloody and explosive diarrhea . Slate reports that at least 22 similar cases of explosive diarrhea were linked to that same race in 2012. The sudden diarrhea outbreak pushed the CDC to investigate and they found that the mud races are held on farmland that 'might be exposed to fecally contaminated water or slurry that potentially serious diarrheal disease can result if ingested, even inadvertently.' The CDC says that racers are exposed to the fecally transmitted bacteria campylobacter coli that is hazardous to health and can begin affecting the body 2-5 days after exposure. 'These events typically are held in rural areas and often include man-made slurry fields (a mixture of soil or clay and water) as race 'challenges,' the CDC says. 'In areas commonly frequented by animals, topsoil used in the creation of slurry fields can be contaminated with feces from domestic fowl or ruminants or wild animals. Competitors who run or ride through such areas might unintentionally swallow sufficient numbers of organisms to cause clinical disease.' Lieutenant Colonel Chad Claar, the public health flight commander at Nellis Air Force Base who led the research told the Washington Post that he believes more than 22 people got sick after the race in Nevada but only a handful of the participants reported it. A competitor comforts his teammate after she made it through the last obstacle during the Tough Mudder at Mt. Snow in Vermont . Those who join in the race like to pride themselves on physical toughness and compete in a series of obstacles beyond trudging through the mud. Racers must face shocks from electrical wire fences and the cold from freezing ice baths called 'Arctic Enemas.' When some racers reach the finish line, their obstacles are just beginning as they may have trouble 'letting go' of the race entirely. 'Participants also need to be encouraged to seek appropriate medical care for post-competition diarrhea,' the CDC advises, 'especially bloody diarrhea, and to inform medical personnel of their exposure.' Other than explosive and bloody diarrhea, very few injuries have been reported.","Tough Mudder obstacle courses sometimes take place on farms that may have fecally contaminated water warns the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

"By . Associated Press . and Alexandra Klausner . Ephrian Myles, 47, will spend a year behind bars for pouring hot sauce on a puppy . A Sarasota, Florida man who doused a puppy with hot sauce has been sentenced to one year in county jail. On Thursday 47-year-old Ephrian Myles pleaded no contest to animal cruelty charges. Circuit Judge Donna Berlin also ordered him to serve 18 months of probation and to complete an anger management course. She told Myles he is not to own a pet or live in a house where there are animals. The Sarasota Herald-Tribune reports that Myles became annoyed with his girlfriend Kelly Ripley's 3-month-old dachshund-chihuahua mix named Gizmo and poured hot sauce on the dog. Authorities say the hot sauce got in the dog's eyes and throat. Fox reports that that officers Jessica Sullivan and Adam Arena met Ripley at a fire station near her apartment after Ripley alerted the authorities. The two officers washed the hot sauce off of the dog with water and a towel and the dog was turned over to Animal Services. Investigating officers who went to the woman's house on the 3500 block of Old Bradenton Road said they saw a pool of hot sauce on the floor. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Gizmo, who was three-months-old at the time of the attack, survived and has been adopted by a new family . After the brutal incident, Gizmo suffered seizure-like symptoms and had trouble breathing . 'It couldn't open its eyes,' Officer Sullivan told Fox. 'One eyes was completely swollen shut and the other was barely open.' 'I picked it up, looked at it, brought it to my face, and I could smell the pepper and the vinegar. I looked at [Officer Arena] and was like, this dog has hot sauce on it,' Sullivan said. When officer Arena confronted Myles about the attack, he denied having anything to do with the assault before he was arrested. Myles had prior convictions so his one year sentence could have been a lot worse. The puppy was treated for neurological problems and later adopted by new owners. 'It was a good resolution,' Assistant State Attorney Dan Yuter told the Sarasota Herald Tribune. 'There were some problems with the case. There wasn't an eye witness, no direct evidence. I'm just glad the dog was OK and the guy went to jail .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A new report commissioned by the U.S. speedskating team has catalogued a series of mistakes that contributed to the team's worst performance in 30 years at this winter's Sochi Olympics. Among the errors were the late introduction of suits made by Under Armour as well as having the team train at high altitude and outdoors in Italy prior to the games, which took place indoors and at sea level. The findings show that the conditions in Italy masked a drop in form by the athletes. A new report cites late introduction of new uniforms and poorly planned altitude training as factors in the U.S. speedskating team's worst Olympic performance in decades . The report, detailed in a story by the Wall Street Journal, reflects a team becoming progressively more and more frustrated as athletes failed to excel. The Under Armour suits, given to the team only shortly before the race, should likely have been replaced with new Mach 39 suits as well as a skate polish introduced just before competition. 'The idea that we . would give these game-changers to our athletes right before the Olympics . and they would get to the line and feel like they had an advantage, . that did not work,' said Ted Mr. Morris, executive director of U.S. Speedskating. 'The lesson there is that if we . have game-changers like that, let's introduce them in December, not . February.' The review also noted that there was a failure to analyze performance data prior to the Sochi Olympics that would have easily predicted the team would not peak . Baltimore-based Under Armour declined requests to comment on the report. The company has renewed their partnership with the U.S. through the 2022 winter games. Other issues included a demanding traveling schedule and a lack of collecting and analyzing data that could have predicted the team would not peak in Sochi. 'When . you go back and look at those performance trends, our expectations going . into Sochi were not realistic,' Mr. Morris said. 'The idea that we were . going to go there and win eight, 10, 12 medals in long-track alone was . way off.' The team has since parted with director Finn Halvorsen, who was a major supporter of altitude training as well as guiding the team in the run up to the Olympics. The report is not unlike USA Track & Field's review of the U.S. men's and women's relay team performance in the 2008 summer games, which cited 'excessive travel and poor . long-term planning on the part of athletes, their coaches and agents"" That report's recommendations helped the team score 29 medals in London in 2012. The speedskating organization was somewhat reticent to undergo such a review. 'There was a little bit of a . reaction of, 'you know, Â‘I don't want to relive it. I want to put it my . rearview mirror. You guys figure it out,'' Morris said.","Late introduction of Under Armour suits may have contributed to terrible showing .

"By . Associated Press . Charged: Jessica Lee Jensen has been arrested for murder and neglect over her son's death . A North Dakota woman whose 13-year-old son died weighing just 21 pounds sometimes locked the boy in a dirty bedroom filled with trash, a detective testified Thursday during a hearing where a judge determined she would stand trial on murder and other charges. Judge Gary Lee heard testimony and arguments from attorneys in Minot before deciding the state had more than met the burden of proof necessary to try the 35-year-old Jessica Jensen, of Kenmare, for one count of murder, one count of neglect or abuse of a child and one count of failure to report the death of a child. Jensen has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. State Medical Examiner William Massello said in his autopsy that Jensen's son died from chronic starvation due to untreated juvenile appetite disorder. He listed the manner of death as homicide. Jensen's attorney, Bob Martin, argued that she neglected her son's untreated medical condition but did not deliberately starve him and should not be charged with murder. For more than an hour, prosecutor Kelly Dillon interviewed Detective Laura Forbes, an investigator whose answers painted a detailed picture of the living conditions in some areas of Jensen's house and the alleged mistreatment of her middle child. Forbes said Jensen told the detective that she had at times locked her son in a bedroom on the second floor of her home. Forbes testified that both windows in the bedroom were covered in black plastic and were boarded up with plywood. She said the room was filled with trash, that the room smelled of feces and urine and that food was splattered across the walls. Court documents show Jensen had home-schooled her children since 2009. Forbes said investigators found few educational materials in the home; everything they found fit in one paper grocery bag full of books. Forbes said they also found a Kindle reading device that had several books about child abuse on it. Forbes said Jensen's mother told detectives that she believed Jensen did not want her son. She also said that after Jensen's son had died, Jensen allegedly told her mother that 'she was at ease.' Jensen is charged with failing to report the death because authorities contend she waited more than two hours to call police. By the time police arrived, the boy's body was stiff. Forbes said that when she saw the body in the hospital on the night the boy died, she didn't realize at first that he was in the bed. He was 'very thin, only bones with skin on them,' she said. Jensen told investigators her son had a hormonal growth problem and that his pituitary gland did not function properly. She said her son would eat and then throw up. Forbes said medical records show he had not seen a doctor for several years. Forbes testified that there was plenty of food in the house and it didn't appear the family was tight on money. Jensen didn't testify Thursday, but sat silent, often looking down at her attorney's notes. Martin requested more time to file motions before the trial, citing his busy schedule. A pre-trial conference is scheduled for September.","Jessica Lee Jensen accused of not getting medical treatment for her child .

"By . Associated Press . An 18-year-old Arizona man accused of being a serial sex predator who allegedly targeted fellow high school students has been re-arrested. Officials say Pinal County sheriff's detectives arrested Tyler Kost on Thursday on new allegations that include additional cases reported after his initial arrest. 'This is a serious and serial sex offender and rapist,' Sheriff Paul Babeu said during a news conference. 'We're approaching 20 victims. There likely will be others that come forward.' Nearly all of the potential victims are high school students. Multiple charges: Tyler Kost, 18, from Arizona is accused of multiple sex crimes against an underaged girls in the state. He has now been re-arrested as the number of potential victims climbs to 18 . Lured teenage girls: Detectives said because he looked young and innocent, many people didn't perceive him as a threat . Investigators said they discovered one girl is 13 years old. The oldest girl is 17. 'Once we started looking at it, it immediately started to mushroom,' said Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu. 'We absolutely believe there will be far more victims that are out there.' Babeu also said Kost threatened and harassed victims that escalated so much that two fled the state and one attempted suicide. Kost is a student at Poston Butte High School. He was  booked into the Pinal County Jail on two counts of sexual assault and two counts of sexual misconduct with a minor related to one of the cases. In one case, Kost threatened, harassed . and told one of the victims to kill herself, deputies said. The girl . followed through and attempted suicide and was hospitalized. While . in the hospital, she allegedly got a message from Kost, threatening . that if she returned to school he would 'make her life a living hell.' The arrest came after someone tipped off a Pinal County sheriff's detective assigned to the Persons Crimes Bureau. Around the same time, officials with the Florence Unified School District say Kost came into the office to report being bullied. He . was not aware there was a simultaneous investigation of the sex . assaults with Kost as a suspect, as well as the bully allegations. School . officials said the thinking was that Kost was being bullied in relation . to rumors among students that he was involved in the alleged assaults. Multiple offenses: Cops say they are approaching 20 victims. There likely will be others that come forward . Detectives opened an investigation and identified eight other girls who claimed they had been sexually assaulted, sexually abused and molested by Kost. The alleged attacks happened at several places. 'He would assault these young female victims in their own bedrooms, in his bedroom, in the desert, at a community pool, at community parks,' Babeu said. Detectives said because he looked young and innocent, many people didn't perceive him as a threat. A County Attorney's Office spokesman was not able to immediately identify Kost's lawyer. 'There was a clear breach of trust,' Babeu said of Kost. 'From all of the accounts of the victims, (Kost) is someone who is highly manipulative, very charismatic and charming in how he presented himself. And then things obviously turned.' The sheriff was also critical of the judge who released Kost on bond after the initial charges were filed. Nasty man: In one case, Kost threatened, harassed and told one of the victims to kill herself, deputies said. The girl followed through and attempted suicide and was hospitalized . Kost, who lives in the San Tan Valley on the southeast fringe of the Phoenix metropolitan area, was released on $10,000 bond after being arrested Monday on suspicion of two counts each of sexual assault and sexual misconduct with a minor. The County Attorney's Office said it had requested a $100,000 bond for Kost but is now asking that he be held without bond. The office says Kost allegedly threatened to kill victims and witnesses. Kost was scheduled to make an initial appearance in court Friday on the new allegations.","Tyler Kost, 18, has been labelled a serial sex predator who allegedly targeted teenage high school girls .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Discovery Channel have axed a true-crime series which exposed teachers who had sex with their students, following a backlash from educators. 'Bad' Teachers', a three-part series on Investigation Discovery, was cancelled after its Sunday debut when teachers unions complained the program was 'offensive' and misrepresented the profession. Discovery Education's Steve Dembo announced the cancellation on his blog Tuesday, saying the company 'shared the concerns' of angry viewers. 'We appreciate the support of the educational community for bringing (their objections to the show) to our attention and we are pleased to share that Discovery Communications has decided to immediately cancel this program, removing it from ID's on-air and online schedule,' Dembo wrote.

American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten welcomed the cancellation, saying she hoped teachers unions could work with Discovery Communications to 'showcase the real work teachers do every day'. 'I was surprised to learn, through a barrage of tweets Sunday night after 'Bad Teacher' aired, that Discovery would use its brand to promote such an offensive program,' she said, according to Washington Examiner. 'However, I am heartened that it has taken steps to cancel the show and publicly affirm that Discovery Education's mission is to celebrate and support educators. 'Every day, educators go into the classroom to make a difference in the lives of our children. Their work should be honored and valued, not bashed.'

"By . Associated Press . Convicted: David Tarloff (pictured) has been sentenced to life behind bars for the gruesome killing of psychologist Kathryn Faughey in 2008 . A schizophrenic man has been sentenced to life in prison without parole for hacking a psychotherapist to death with a meat cleaver, capping a criminal case confounded for years by questions about the attacker's mental health. During today's proceeding, David Tarloff described a constant battle in his mind and pleaded for mercy as he was sentenced on his first-degree murder conviction, a conclusion that came after repeated mistrials and findings that Tarloff was unfit for court. He apologized to the victim's family and begged for as light a sentence as possible - 40 years to life - while describing 28 years of being tormented by what seemed to him like the voices of God and Satan. 'I've never hurt a single person intentionally,' Tarloff said. 'I didn't want to do this, I swear to God ... but I thought all these bad things were going to happen.' The victim's siblings described the life she had built for herself as the eldest of seven children of Irish immigrants, and the judge talked about his own similar upbringing and his certainty that she was leading a beautiful life in heaven. Tarloff, 47, never disputed killing psychologist Kathryn Faughey in February 2008 in her Manhattan office. Tarloff had never met her but intended to stick up her office mate - a psychiatrist he hadn't seen in 17 years - in hopes of netting tens of thousands of dollars to use to take his sick mother to Hawaii. His defense argued that the often hospitalized, frequently delusional Tarloff should not be held criminally accountable for the bloodbath. But prosecutors said despite his psychiatric condition, Tarloff - whose doctors had found him to be obsessed with religion - behaved deliberately and knew he was doing wrong. Verdict: Schizophrenic David Tarloff (seated) was found guilty of murder in Manhattan Criminal Court on March 28 . Faughey's family saw Tarloff as a conniving criminal. 'He is a liar. He is a thief. He is a thug,' one of her brothers, Owen Faughey, said as he noted a bitter irony. 'If given a chance, I know our sister would have helped him.' 'His illness doesn't negate the ability to assess the morality of his actions,' Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Evan Krutoy said in a closing argument. 'Convict him. Because he's guilty.' But defense lawyer Bryan Konoski told jurors that 'David's reality is nothing like any of you have ever experienced in your life.' Tarloff was diagnosed with schizophrenia while in college, when he told physicians he felt like his 'brain was falling apart.' Over the ensuing years, he reported seeing the 'eye of God' on a kitchen floor, believing his brain was talking to him as Satan and thinking he was the Messiah, medical records show. By early 2008, he had become panicked about how a nursing home was caring for his mother, and he was fixated on getting her out. He came up with the robbery plot targeting Faughey's officemate, Dr. Kent Shinbach, who had been the first doctor to commit Tarloff to a hospital. Heartbreaking: David Tarloff had never met therapist Kathryn Faughey before he murdered her in 2008 . Tragic: Therapist Kathryn Faughey was brutally murdered in her Upper East Side office in February 2008 . Tarloff told authorities he figured he would get Shinbach's ATM card and withdraw $40,000 or more. He later told doctors he believed he had God's blessing for his plan. It took a turn when he walked into the office and encountered Faughey, a psychologist who specialized in helping people with relationships. He slashed her 15 times with a meat cleaver, fractured her skull with a mallet and seriously wounded Shinbach when he tried to intervene. Tarloff told authorities he hadn't intended to hurt anyone but thought Faughey was going to kill him, though he also has told doctors he thought she was malevolently associated with Shinbach. Prosecutors noted that Tarloff bought weapons for the robbery, called ahead to find out the office's hours and successfully avoided authorities for a few days before police identified him through fingerprints. 'Justice has been served': Victim Kathryn Faughey's brothers Michael (left) and Owen Faughey (right), and an unidentified sister, smile as they leave the courtroom on March 28 when David Tarloff was convicted of killing their sister . 'Celebrating her life and many accomplishments': Kathryn Faughey's loved ones gathered in February to mark the six-year anniversary of her brutal murder . 'Doctors Faughey and Shinbach devoted their careers to helping people who have mental illnesses, making this cold-blooded attack all the more tragic,' Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said in a statement after the sentence was handed down. Insanity defenses, like Tarloff's, are offered in less than one percent of felony cases nationwide, and only about 20 percent of those are successful, researchers have found. Tarloff was initially found mentally unfit to stand trial. Then he was declared competent, but his behavior deteriorated during jury selection in 2010 and he was found incompetent again for a time. A trial last year ended in a hung jury. In additional to first-degree murder, Tarloff was convicted in March of second-degree murder, assault and attempted robbery. Owen Faughey said after the sentencing that he hoped prison officials treated Tarloff with compassion. Manhunt: Police arrested David Tarloff in 2008 at his Queens apartment building (pictured) Under arrest: David Tarloff was arrested at his Queens apartment complex in 2008 . State Supreme Court Justice Edward McLaughlin had noted that prison officials were aware of Tarloff's medical history and would most likely hold him in a prison psychiatric unit, rather than in the general population. Owen Faughey was among about a dozen Faughey relatives at the sentencing. Some of her siblings have attended all the roughly 95 days of court since the case began. 'It's final, it's over, and we're very relieved with that,' another brother, Michael Faughey, said afterward. Tarloff's brother, Robert Tarloff of Olney, Md., watched from the courtroom audience. 'Now that justice has been served for his crime, justice needs to be served for David - he needs to be cared for' in prison, he said.","David Tarloff, 47, killed Kathryn Faughey in 2008 at her Manhattan office .

"By . Kirk Maltais . An actor hired to portray popular superhero 'Captain America' was arrested this week for allegedly sending photos of his penis to an underage girl. 29 year-old James Alton, from Maitland, Florida, was arrested on Wednesday before being able to meet in person with the 16 year-old. In text-message conversations with the teen, Alton made plans for the two of them to meet up at a local mall on Friday. He also allegedly talked about 'getting into her' during their conversations. James Alton posing with a Universal Studios parkgoer in his Captain America costume (seen left) / James Alton's mugshot after his arrest by Maitland County police for transmitting harmful material to a minor via electronic device (seen right) Alton was busted after the teen's father was tipped off about the possibility that the two would meet up. The father confronted his daughter about the relationship, and she then confirmed to him that the two had been talking, and that the tone of their interactions became sexual. The father told police that he had found the pictures Alton allegedly sent on her phone. Police arrested Alton, charging him with transmitting harmful material to a minor via electronic device, a felony. Alton came into contact with the 16 year-old after she posed with him for a picture at the theme park three weeks ago. She then posted the picture online, where Alton saw it and left a comment. Their online friendship began from there, with the two exchanging phone numbers and then texting each other frequently. However, the correspondence soon turned sexual, with Alton talking to her about masturbation and trading photographs with her. According to Maitland police, 8-10 pictures were exchanged between the two. Nearly two weeks before his arrest, the teen informed Alton that she was 16 year-old girl. One week later, he sent her a picture of his penis. Alton taking a selfie in his car. He told police that the relationship he had with the girl was 'merely online' and 'flirtatious' In the arrest affidavit, Alton told police that he 'thought it was a joke,' and that he thought it was a 'merely online flirtatious relationship.' Alton's roommate told WTEV that entire incident is a big misunderstanding. 'It doesn't sound like him at all.  He is a pretty good guy,' said the roommate, Adam Ring.

"By . Nic North . Court victory: Jennifer Jones sparked a nationwide hunt when she went on the run with her children . A mother who sparked a nationwide hunt when she went on the run with her children wept tears of joy yesterday after fighting off an attempt by her ex-husband to have her jailed. The ruling in Jennifer Jones’s favour came after one of her five children, 16-year-old Jessica, told the presiding judge at the High Court she would rather die than go to Spain to live with her father. Ms Jones’s triumph this week was the latest episode in a long-running and upsetting chain of events triggered by the collapse of her marriage to Spanish army officer Tomas Palacin Cambra in 2008. The family made headlines in 2012 when schoolteacher Ms Jones and her new partner John Williams took four of her five children on the run on the day they should have been returned to their father at Cardiff railway station. Although the youngest two, Eva, ten, and David, eight, now live with their father and eldest sister Sara, 17, in Spain, Jessica and Tomas, 14, refused to go back and last night repeated their vow never to return. In court this week, Ms Jones faced an application by her ex to have her jailed for failing to comply with court orders for the children to be returned to Spain. Jessica’s account of the family’s troubles during the hearing moved the presiding judge, Sir James Munby, to say it was ‘one of the saddest things’ he had ever heard. The teenager, who is due to sit her first GCSE exam at her school in Llanelli on May 10, told the court she wanted to stay in South Wales with her mother and Tomas. She said: ‘I’m not going back. I’d rather die than go back’ – and confirmed she had told police officers in 2012 that if she was forced to return to Spain she would ‘top herself’. Her father’s barrister, James Turner QC, . asked her why she did not want to go back to Spain. ‘I am scared of my . father,’ she replied. The slight figure, wrapped in a . charcoal-coloured cardigan and with metal braces on her teeth, added: . ‘He has really bad tempers. I want to be with my mum.’ Anguish: Jessica, ringed, told the presiding judge at the High Court she would rather die than go to Spain to live with her father. She is pictured with siblings, from left, David, Eva, Tomas and Sara in an undated photo . Desperate: A letter from Jessica, Jennifer's daughter, begging a judge to let her stay . Mr Palacin Cambra was not in court for the three-day hearing. Mr Turner asked Jessica how she would feel if her mother went to prison, as her father’s court application was seeking. ‘I’d have a breakdown,’ she replied. ‘There is nothing my mum could have said or done to have made us go back to Spain. I don’t understand why he would want to put mum into jail. This is just  too much.’ On the final day of the hearing on Friday, Sir James revealed how deeply moved he had been by the account Jessica had given about the breakdown of her relationship with Sara. She had told the court they had once been ‘really close’ but that now her older sister would not even answer her phone calls. Ms Jones's triumph comes after a long-running court battle with Spanish army officer Tomas Palacin Cambra . She said: ‘I miss Sara so much but I think she just wants to ignore  me now.’ Her comments prompted Sir James, who is head of the High Court family division, to say later: ‘I think one of the saddest things I have ever heard in a courtroom was Jessica explaining why and how her relationship with Sara had changed.’ Dismissing the application to have their mother jailed, Sir James said his full and detailed judgment would follow ‘in due course’. After the hearing, Ms Jones, 48, said she felt ‘pleased and relieved’. But she added: ‘This victory, if that is what it is, feels very hollow, because at the heart of this terribly sad matter are five children who are no longer together as a family as they should be. ‘It is so hard on all of them. They should be together, playing and smiling and doing all the things siblings do together. I will never give up fighting to reunite them.’","Jessica, 16, wrote to judge pleading to stay with mother Jennifer Jones .

Chuck and Elicia James are seen here reunited with dog Reckless, who they lost during Superstorm Sandy . James said the family had planned in recent weeks to get a new dog as a 10th birthday surprise for their eldest daughter, Ally. The couple has two other children, Kelsey and Liam. But when the family of five went to the Monmouth County SPCA on Thursday to adopt a new animal, James and his wife approached the first cage and saw a familiar face inside. 'He was a little bigger than I remembered because they had fed him well,' James joked. 'But then he was laying on my wife's feet, and I knew it was him. ... I was in disbelief. I know this dog is meant to be with our family.' When SPCA officials asked if they could prove the animal was their dog, a friend sent over a picture showing the family with their dog before Sandy hit the Jersey shore. Lost: Reckless got out of a hole in a fence at the James' home in Keansburg, New Jersey, pictured . 'We're all so happy to have him back,' James said. 'Thank God for no-kill shelters because every time they kill an animal, it's somebody's friend who might be lost. Thank God they didn't put him down because this would have been a different story.' SPCA officials say Reckless was picked up as a stray and has now been microchipped. The family is living in a hotel while their storm-damaged Keansburg home is repaired. This weekend, the Jameses went on a camping trip with Reckless to celebrate the dog's return.","Chuck James and his family searched for dog Reckless for months before giving up hope .

"By . Dan Bloom . Nigel Farage has waded into the Top Gear racism row - insisting it was 'just typical Clarkson'. The Ukip leader defended the 54-year-old after Jeremy Clarkson claimed he was on his final warning from the BBC and will be sacked if he ever makes an offensive remark again. Speaking as he unveiled an anti-immigration billboard, Mr Farage insisted the Top Gear presenter had not crossed the line. Scroll down for video . Wading in: Jeremy Clarkson, who is under fire for footage (left) in which he 'appeared' to say the word n*****, has found an ally in Ukip leader Nigel Farage (right). Today Mr Farage said: 'It's just typical Clarkson' He said: 'The more controversial Jeremy Clarkson is, the more . people watch his programme, and the more money the BBC makes out of . marketing a show that sells globally and makes them a fortune. 'I . would think it's just typical Clarkson, getting very, very close to the . line of being offensive but perhaps not quite going over it.' Today Clarkson wrote in his weekly newspaper column that he did not want to apologise for 'appearing' to say n***** in unaired Top Gear footage, but the BBC made him. And he said: 'I've been told by the BBC that if I make one more offensive remark, anywhere, at any time, I will be sacked. 'And even the angel Gabriel would struggle to survive with that hanging over his head. 'It's inevitable that one day, someone, somewhere will say that I've offended them, and that will be that.' Controversy: Mr Farage was speaking as he unveiled an anti-immigration billboard in Dover, Kent . Mr Farage was correct to say Top Gear is one of the BBC's highest-earning shows. Rights to air and mimic the motoring show, as well as merchandise and DVD sales, are exported around the globe through the Corporation's commercial arm BBC Worldwide. The firm, which is owned by the BBC but is free to operate as a business, made a £156million profit in 2012/13 and Top Gear is usually cited as its biggest income stream. Clarkson himself made an estimated £14million when the BBC took full control of Top Gear production company Bedder 6. Since the move he was also rumoured to be the highest-paid presenter in the BBC. The star became embroiled in controversy after unaired footage of him using a nursery rhyme to compare two sports cars was leaked to the media. Defence: Mr Farage also had to admit his party had some 'idiots' after a candidate called David Cameron a 'gay-loving nutcase' and said Muslims were the children of the devil . Historically the rhyme was 'Eeny meeny miny mo, catch a n***** by his toe', and Clarkson said he 'mumbled' in two takes to avoid using the racist term - which made it sound like he was saying it. In the third, which was broadcast, he said the word 'teacher' instead. An online petition calling for the BBC presenter to be sacked has reached more than 1,000 signatures. Apology: Clarkson's video message this week . Mr Farage was speaking as he . launched Ukip's billboard campaign for the European elections against the . backdrop of the white cliffs of Dover. The campaign poster features a . picture of the famous landmark with an escalator running up the middle . and the slogan: 'No border. No control. The EU has opened our borders to . 4,000 people every week.' The poster adds: 'Take back control of our country.' During the launch he was forced to admit Ukip had 'some idiots' after a row erupted over Stockport council election candidate Harry Perry. On Twitter Mr Perry called for Pakistan to be 'nuked', dubbed David Cameron a 'gay-loving nutcase', Muslims 'devil's kids' and homosexuality an 'abomination before god'. Mr Farage said: 'I've never heard of the bloke until last night. I've no idea who he is. 'I . think he comes from the north west of England. Clearly his attitude and . views are entirely inconsistent with being a member of Ukip. Simple.' Mr Perry was suspended from the party today. But Mr Farage claimed the media's reporting of what goes wrong in his party is 'completely disproportionate'. He added: 'I could show you 14 elected councillors from the Lib Dem, Labour and Conservative parties who haven't just said nasty things they've been convicted this year of nasty things. And yet it never makes a national headline.'","Ukip leader said Clarkson was 'very close to the line but not quite over it'

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Four out of five monkeys stolen during a zoo break-in have been found. Three cotton-top tamarins, a critically endangered species, and two emperor tamarins were taken from Blackpool Zoo last Tuesday after a hole was cut in a perimeter fence and locks taken off two enclosures. Each of the rare creatures would be worth thousands on the black market. Five monkeys were stolen from Blackpool Zoo, Lancashire in a late-night raid. The five monkeys included this baby cotton-top tamarin and two female cotton-top tamarins which are critically-endangered species . One of the stolen female cotton-top tamarins, which were born in primate at the zoo, was pregnant . One of the stolen monkeys was three months pregnant. As alerts were raised, experts warned the baby monkey who was snatched will die if separated from its mother. On Friday night, four of the monkeys were found in a cardboard box 80 miles away in Bradford. Police said the creatures had been targeted specifically and their details had been circulated to ports and airports. The National Wildlife Crime Unit was also involved in the hunt. On Facebook, the zoo said it was ‘delighted’ and that the monkeys’ keeper had travelled to West Yorkshire to collect them. The monkeys, which included this emperor tamarin, are said to need specialist care in order to survive . The stolen animals, including this Emperor Tamarin, could be sold on the black market for thousands . There are just 6,000 cotton-top tamarin monkeys left in the wild in their native Colombia, with numbers reduced by deforestation. It is one of the most critically-endangered - and smallest - primates in the world. The species was listed in the 'The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates' between 2008 and 2012. The species is found in tropical forests in northwestern Colombia. Its diet includes insects and plant extracts. It is thought that, historically, up to 40,000 cotton-top tamarins were caught and exported for use in biomedical research. Staff at the zoo said the remaining monkeys have been 'quiet and subdued' since the incident . The thieves cut a hole in a perimeter fence and took locks of two enclaves at Blackpool Zoo . But in 1976, they were given the highest level of protection and all international trade was banned. But the species is still at risk, because their natural habitat is being destroyed. The lowland forest in Colombia has been reduced to five percent of its previous area. The cotton-top tamarin is easily spotted by the long white crest reaching from its forehead to its shoulders. The emperor tamarin is native to the Amazon rainforest. Its name is derived from its imperial-looking long white moustache.","Five monkeys stolen from Blackpool Zoo, Lancashire in late-night raid .

"By . Wills Robinson . A professional gang of drug dealers who flooded the streets with heroin and crack cocaine has been jailed for a total of 177 years today. The well-organised drugs network, made up of 22 people, dealt on an industrial scale before their operation was uncovered by a tip off from a member of the public. Teesside Crown Court heard the ring made more than 100 trips between the north east and Manchester, delivering vast amounts of Class A drugs and money. Industrial scale: Ringer leader Robert Hickman, 29, was jailed for 16 years for his part in the industrial scale drug-dealing operation. Scott Pickering, 28, played a similar role to Hickman and was sentenced to 15 years . Ben Crombie, 31, a 'leading character' was jailed for 14 years . Jamie Knox, 25, was jailed for nine years and four months . Jason Turnbull, 32, was jailed for 10 years and five months . Officers seized almost 6.9kg of heroin, 2.26kg of cocaine, 437.5g of crack cocaine and more than 22kg chemicals used to 'cut' the drugs. The recovered narcotics were worth a total of £824,686 and were found alongside £127,966 cash. But prosecutor Nick Dry said these amounts were just the 'tip of the iceberg'. The plot between January 2012 and March 2013 was uncovered by Operation Cobweb, Cleveland Police's biggest ever drugs operation. Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC, the Recorder of Middlesbrough, said: 'It was carried out in a determined and ruthless fashion. It was conceived and put into effect by professional and experienced criminals who were aiming to achieve a high financial reward. 'And it was a conspiracy which succeeded in bringing over and distributing drugs on a large scale throughout this area.' Martin Dougan, 32, was jailed for nine years and two months . David Hobson, 30, was jailed for eigh years and eight months . Junaid Mahmood, 29, was jailed for eight years and eight months . He said the drugs in the conspiracy 'exceeded well into the tens of kilogrammes'. The longest prison sentence was given to 29-year-old Robert Hickman- the leader of the Teesside operation - who was jailed for 16 years. The judge told him: 'You were at the heart of the this conspiracy in the Teesside area. Very little happened in the Teesside area in respect of this conspiracy that you were not aware of.' He said Hickman had 'loyal lieutenants', directed couriers and was in contact with local drug distribution 'cells' using 20 mobile phones. Police found a heat-sealing device, a money-counting machine and large sums of cash when they searched his home. Hickman branded his sentence a 'joke' in a foul-mouthed outburst as he was led from the dock yesterday. Scott Hine, 31, was jailed for eight years . Stephen Sparrow, 28, was jailed for eight years and eight months . Ricky Beresford, 24, was jailed for six years and eight months . The judge said Scott Pickering aka Scott McGowan, 28, was a 'hardened criminal' playing a similar role, jailing him for 15 years. Ben Crombie, 31, who was jailed for 14 year, was described as a 'leading character' who directed the conspiracy and recruited others, distancing himself from the drugs. Crombie was able to buy expensive homes, cars and private education from the plot. He received a lighter sentence than Hickman and Pickering because, unlike them, he pleaded guilty. His 'right hand man' James Kelly, 29, from Oldham, who controlled and managed couriers, was jailed for 10 years and eight months. Former Army infantryman Jamie Knox, 25, from Oldham, a warehouseman who stored and bagged drugs, was jailed for nine years and four months. A series of dealers who operated in Teessside were also sentenced. Jason Turnbull, 32, who had met Crombie in prison, was jailed for 10 years and five months and Martin Dougan, 32, from Middlesbrough, was jailed for nine years and two months. Danny Wilks, 24, was arrested with half a kilo of heroin after a £20,000 cash drop, was jailed for seven years and four months . Former Royal Artilleryman Mark Watson, 27, was jailed for four years and four months . David Wrigley, 32, was jailed for seven years . David Hobson, 30, of Stockton - said to have been a talented footballer at Hartlepool United - and Junaid Mahmood, 29, from Stockton, both had a drug dealing 'cell'. Each were jailed for eight years and eight months. Scott Hine, 31,Middlesbrough, a 'persistent' dealer with his own team, was jailed for eight years. 'Determined and persistent drug dealer' Stephen Sparrow, 28, of Black was jailed for six years and eight months. Hickman's 'right hand man' Ricky Beresford, 24, was jailed for six years and four months. The judge said he was of low intelligence and easily influenced. Danny Wilks, 24, was arrested with half a kilo of heroin after a £20,000 cash drop and was jailed for seven years and four months. David Cuthbert, 38, was given a five-year sentence. Former Royal Artilleryman Mark Watson, 27, and engineer Paul Gill, 36, of Stockton, were each jailed for four years and four months. Paul Gill, 36, was jailed for four years and four months . Mark Powell, 36, was jailed for three years and three years and 12 weeks . Marl Dutton, 59, was jailed for six years and eight months . Mark Powell, 36, who collected drugs on one day, was jailed for three years and 12 weeks. Painter and decorator David Wrigley, 32, from Failsworth, Greater Manchester, made 13 trips to Teesside in 16 days to deliver drugs and collect cash. When he was arrested, police found £52,600 cash on him and he was jailed for seven years. Mark Dutton, 59, from Rochdale, and Stephen Mayall, 30, from Royton, Oldham, who both made more than 20 trips, were each jailed for six years and eight months. Personal trainer Ben Graham, 25, of Oldham, who made 12 trips, was jailed for six years. His partner Hannah Hesketh, of Ashton-under-Lyne, who drove him to Teesside, was jailed for three-and-a-half years for her 'lesser role'. Write caption here . All pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs except Hickman,Pickering and Hesketh who denied taking part in the plot and were convicted in March. Several of the men - Sparrow, Beresford, Hobson and Dougan - had previous convictions for drug trafficking. Wilks, Graham, Knox, Dutton, Mahmood, Hesketh and Gill had no previous convictions. Defence barristers variously stressed factors like remorse, shame, references, personal difficulties, families, tragedies, trauma, illness,limited roles, vulnerability, work, drug addictions, debt, financial hardship and efforts to better themselves. Crombie wrote a letter to the judge saying he'd met victims of drug abuse in prison. He wrote: 'Without my actions some of these people would never have resorted to crime. 'For that I would like to apologise to each and every one of them. 'I'm embarrassed and ashamed to tell you that I had it all and I threw it all away by my stupid and foolish selfish actions.' Five other men were previously sentenced for connected drug offences. Judge Bourne-Arton commended the police for a skillful, professional and determined investigation.","22 people from around the country were sentenced at Teesside Crown Court .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Coach driver Felicity Hall, 46, pleaded guilty to drink driving after she was spotted 'staggering around' Manchester Piccadilly station . A coach driver who was caught 'staggering around' a railway station just minutes before she was due to drive passengers home has been banned from the roads. Felicity Hall, 46, was heard 'slurring' her words and openly admitted she had been drinking - despite the fact she was about to drive a coach full of passengers from Manchester Piccadilly railway station, a court has heard. Hall, from Horwich, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to drink-driving after tests found she was more than twice over the legal limit. Manchester Magistrates' Court heard Hall would have gone on to drive the coach while she was over the limit if another staff member had not raised the alarm. Prosecutor Gareth Hughes also told how Hall, who had no previous convictions, had since been sacked by the company for which she worked, Atlantic Travel. District Judge James Prowse told the . defendant that the incident, which took place just after midnight on April 13, could have been very dangerous. He said: 'Had this not been stopped there would have been passengers . on board a bus driven by someone over the legal limit.' Mr Hughes told the court how Hall was spotted pulling up in a coach, before getting out to talk to a station co-ordinator. Hall was spotted at Manchester Piccadilly railway station, pictured, from where she was due to drive a coach of stranded passengers on a rail replacement service . Hall was only stopped from driving the coach when staff at the station saw her 'stumbling around'. She then admitted she had been drinking . The co-ordinator's job was to direct passengers to the right coaches for their rail replacement services, the court was told. When the co-ordinator asked Hall why she was there, she told the man she had been 'covering' for another coach which had not turned up, the court was told. She then told the man she had been drinking and was seen 'staggering about'. Mr Hughes said the coordinator then informed the British Transport Police. Yasser Dean, managing director at Atlantic Travel, the company for which Hall worked, had also phoned the station co-ordinator to warn him about Hall's possible state. Mr Dean said he had heard Hall 'slur her words' during a random telephone check. Hall has since been sacked from the coach company for which she worked . Hall was arrested and later had a breath-test. Her reading was 81 micrograms of alcohol, the court heard. The legal limit is 35mg. The district judge adjourned the hearing, warning Hall she would possibly be given a community sentence. The judge warned her: 'Driving while disqualified is an extremely serious, imprisonable offence. 'The circumstances of this case I feel make it rather too serious to deal with simply with a financial penalty.' Hall was handed an interim driving ban until the sentencing hearing on June 3. Speaking after the hearing, Mr Dean said: 'Passenger safety is our paramount concern.'","Felicity Hall, 46, from Horwich, Manchester, pleaded guilty to drink driving .

"By . Amanda Williams . Two girls havebeen arrested over an alleged plot to kill teacher Alison Cray . Two girls have been arrested for allegedly plotting to kill a maths teacher at their school, just days after Ann Maguire was stabbed to death. The girls, aged 14 and 15, were taken away by police to be questioned over the suspected knife plot to murder teacher Alison Cray at their 1,000 pupil school, in Wales. The 15-year-old was also arrested for allegedly having a knife in her schoolbag and suspicion of making death threats at  Cwmcarn High School. The . girls were allegedly discussing maths teacher Mrs Cray when . their conversation was overheard. Mrs Cray was described as 'very . popular' with other pupils at the school. Police have stressed no-one was hurt - and that the drama ended peacefully. Police were called to Cwmcarn High School near Newport, South Wales, at lunchtime on Thursday - just three days after the brutal killing of Mrs Maguire in her Leeds school. A police source said: 'The two pupils were overheard in class talking about what they were thinking about doing. 'A teacher was informed and the pupils were challenged. Police were called as a result. 'It was resolved by the time the police arrived at the school. No weapon was seen in the open but a check on a schoolbag discovered a knife which was taken away.' A . spokesman added: 'Officers were called to Cwmcarn High School at . approximately 11.54am on Thursday following concerns being raised about . the behaviour of two pupils. 'Officers attended and arrested a 15-year-old girl from Newbridge and a 14-year-old girl from Risca. 'They have since both been released on police bail pending further enquiries. 'Nobody was harmed as a result of the incident, and the matter was resolved peacefully.' Parents of children at the comprehensive school were last night sent a calming message from the headtacher. Headteacher Mrs Jacquie Peplinski said: 'You may be aware that concerns were raised about a pupil in the school yesterday. 'Please be assured that that the concerns were dealt with swiftly. There was no risk to any staff or learner and the relevant support services were contacted as a precautionary measure. 'Cwmcarn High is a caring and safe environment and we are committed to everyone's safety. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns.' The girls, aged 14 and 15, were taken away by police to be questioned over the suspected knife plot to murder the teacher at their 1,000 pupil school, in Wales . A spokesperson for Caerphilly County Borough Council said: 'We can confirm that concerns were raised about two pupils at Cwmcarn High School yesterday which were swiftly dealt with by staff and Gwent Police. 'Support is now in place for both pupils and staff and we would like to assure parents that all appropriate steps were taken to respond effectively to the situation. We are now helping the police with their enquiries.' The two girls were allowed home and will answer bail at a later date to their nearest police station after officers have made further investigations. A decision will be made next week if the girls will be allowed back to school. Teacher Alison Cray tonight praised the school for their handling of the suspected murder plot.Experienced maths teacher Miss Cray, 46, said: 'It was all handled before it got to me. 'I know very little about it. It all happened elsewhere and I wasn't directly involved at all. 'I've very lucky that I'm at Cwmcarn and that they have handled it so well. I've been working as normal and I'm fine.' Miss Cray has been at the school for more than 10 years and is described as being 'very kind and caring' on pupils social network sites. On the Rate My Teacher website, she is described as being 'awesome, fab and supportive.' Cwmcarn High School is an 11-18 mixed comprehensive school serving the former mining village and its rural surrounding areas. The foundation school website says: 'The school offers the pupils a supportive environment and recognises the potential of all of the pupils.' According to the last school inspection: 'The staff go the extra mile to provide high quality learning so that pupils of all abilities reach their potential.'The Qualification, Curriculum and Assessment Authority for Wales has recognised the school as the most improved school in South East Wales three times since 2000.

"By . David Gardner . Updated: . 07:41 EST, 6 March 2012 . Hoping to head off a premature strike on Iran, President Obama sought to assure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday that America would ‘always have Israel’s back’. The two leaders put on a show of unity before key talks at the White House on Monday. The day after Mr Obama warned of ‘loose talk of war’ with Iran, he insisted there was still time for diplomacy to prevent the rogue regime from obtaining nuclear weapons. In agreement: Both leaders affirmed their support for each others' countries; Mr Obama and Mr Netanyahu will meet in private to further discuss issues of Iran . Two nations: President Obama, right, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met today in the White House to discuss Iran's nuclear program . Should America support Israel if it launches missile strikes on Iran? If push came to shove, he said the U.S. would back Israel. ‘The bond between our two counties is unbreakable,’ he added. But in one of the most consequential meetings between U.S. and Israeli leaders in years, Mr Obama appealed to allow more time for ‘crippling’ sanctions against Iran to work. ‘We believe there is still a window that allows for a diplomatic resolution,’ he said. Sitting side by side and smiling at each other in the Oval Office, both leaders made a clear attempt to put the personal antipathy that has marked some of their previous meetings behind them. But the more hawkish Mr Netanyahu made it plain that Israel would still be the ‘master of its fate’ in deciding how to deal with Tehran, which has called for the destruction of the Jewish state. No games: Mr Obama said Sunday that 'loose talk' of war was only benefiting Iran . In talks: The talks between the leaders were genial and pleasant; they have publicly clashed in the past . ‘Israel has a sovereign right to make its . own decisions. It must have the ability to defend itself, by itself, . against any threat,’ he added. After weeks of mounting concern that . Israel could pre-emptively attack Iran on its own, the two men were . careful to present a united front. 'The bond between our two countries is unbreakable.' -President Obama . Acknowledging there could be some ‘difficult months ahead’, Mr Obama underlined his earlier assurance that the US reserved ‘all options’ in dealing with Iran. He has made it clear that could include military action. ‘We do not want to see a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region in the world,' he said. ‘We do not want the possibility of a nuclear weapon falling into the hands of terrorists. And we do not want a regime that has been a state sponsor of terrorism being able to feel that it can act even more aggressively or with impunity as a consequence of its nuclear power,’ he added. Lots to discuss: The Prime Minister and the President spoke for nearly three hours on Monday in the White House . ‘The agency continues to have serious . concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear . program,’ said International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano. Recent moves to boost uranium . enrichment at Fordo, an underground Iranian facility that may be able to . withstand aerial attack, are of particular concern. Though . Mr Obama was overwhelmingly supported by Jewish voters in the 2008 . election, his campaign has noticed a sharp decrease of support as the . president continues his term. Last . September, a majority of people taking part in the Public Policy Poll . said Israel was ‘very important’ in determining their vote. However, . only 22 per cent of Jewish voters said they agreed with Mr Obama’s . stance on Israel, the Wall Street Journal noted. Many pundits say the Jewish vote will be crucial to Mr Obama’s re-election this November. ‘As Iran is not providing the . necessary cooperation, the agency is unable to provide credible . assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and . activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material . in Iran is in peaceful activities,’ Mr Amano added. In his speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on Sunday, Mr Obama reiterated his belief that sanctions against Iran were taking effect. ‘Now is not the time for bluster,’ he said. ‘Now is the time to let our increased pressure sink in.’ The President framed military force as a last resort, not the next option at a time when sanctions are squeezing Iran. He said just the talk of war has driven up the price of oil to the benefit of Iran. The president and the prime minister . have been on openly rocky terms since Mr Obama took office. At least . year’s G20 summit in Cannes, Mr Obama and French president Nicolas . Sarkozy exchanged candid words in a backroom that were picked up by . others’ microphones. Mr Sarkozy was heard calling Mr Netanyahu ‘a liar’ and said: ‘I can’t bear Netanyahu.’ To which, Mr Obama replied: ‘You’re fed up, but I have to deal with him every day.’ Though . the exchange was hardly surprising, both leaders displayed earnestness, . if not willingness, to move past their tumultuous relationship today.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . A council was forced to put the brakes on a controversial parking scheme – after neighbours pointed out there was nowhere to pay. Residents were baffled when workers unveiled signs for new restrictions before pay machines had been installed. It is the latest gaffe by East Sussex’s Brighton and Hove City Council, which later covered up the signs. Workers were forced to cover up parking signs in Brighton as there was nowhere to pay (stock picture posed by model) Last week The Mail on Sunday revealed how the Green-controlled council was responsible for a catalogue of recent blunders. A spokesman said the scheme had been hit by an ‘unforeseen delivery delay’. Earlier this year, two parking wardens in Brighton issued a driver with a ticket after his car broke down in the middle of a busy road. Passers-by watched in disbelief as wardens from Brighton and Hove City Council, East Sussex, slapped a ticket on the silver saloon car's windscreen after the driver left to fetch help. The car, believed to be a VW Passat, was ticketed while broken down on a busy road in Brighton city centre. A child seat was visible in the vehicle. Parking wardens in Brighton issued a driver with a ticket even though his car had broken down in the middle of the street . Brighton and Hove City Council has been criticised in recent years for the amount of money it makes from parking. In December last year it was revealed that the council's overall profit from parking services for 2012/13 was £16.3million - the most of any local authority outside London. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, whose party captured the city council . Speaking at the time, a Brighton and Hove City Council spokesman said:  'We don't provide commentary on individual cases. 'The driver is well within their rights to make a case for appeal. That will be considered in time. 'However it would be unfair for us to comment beforehand.' Starting with just one councillor in 1996, the Green Party’s rise to power in Brighton has been unprecedented and rapid. In 2010  there was the election of Caroline Lucas as the MP for Brighton Pavilion – the party’s first Westminster seat – and then came the capture of the city council just a year later.","Brighton and Hove City Council started controversial new parking scheme .

"By . Chris Pleasance . He was one of the greatest engineers of British history, designing and building 25 railway lines, over 100 bridges and three ships including the Great Western and Great Britain. She is an award-winning mechanical engineer, a star graduate from the University of Bristol, and one of a few women in her field. And now, Morwenna Wilson, the great-great granddaughter of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, has been charged with renovating the area around King's Cross station, built by Brunel's contemporaries in 1851-52. Morwenna Wilson, 31, the great-great granddaughter of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, has been put in charge of a team of architects and engineers renovating the area around King's Cross Station . At just 31 years old, Ms Wilson will lead a team of architects and engineers tasked with giving a modern-day twist to the old  Victorian structures around the station and bringing them back to life. Brunel was one of the greatest engineers of his time, building 25 railway lines and more than 100 bridges . Speaking about her ancestor to The Times, she said: 'He was an inspiration. It definitely runs in the family. My grandfather was also an engineer.' Studying at the University of Bristol, she was perfectly placed to admire the brilliance of great-great grandfather. In 1833 Brunel was commissioned to work on the Great Western Railway linking London to Bristol, and accomplished many engineering feats during its construction, including the viaducts at Hanwell and Chippenham, the Maidenhead Bridge, the Box Tunnel and Bristol Temple Meads Station. Earlier, in 1931, his designs won a competition to build the Clifton Suspension Bridge across the River Avon which flows through the city. While he was responsible for several architectural feats in London, such as Thames Tunnel from Rotherhithe to Wapping, he wasn't actually the genius behind King's Cross. The station was in fact designed by his contemporary, George Turnbull, and later details were added by Lewis Cubitt. Brunel would be proud to know that, 155 . years on from his death, his descendent is carrying on with the work he . and his contemporaries started. When the work on King's Cross is completed it will house more than 18 restaurants, 2,000 new homes, 23 office spaces and a collection of outdoor venues. Women are woefully under-represented in the construction industry, making up just 11 per cent of the workforce, compared with 50 per cent in finance, 46 per cent of doctors and 27 per cent of police. Among one of his most spectacular achievement is the Clifton Suspension Bridge over the River Avon . While most of his work was completed in the west of England, he designed bridges across the UK inlcuding this one across the River Dee in Balmoral, Scotland . It's something she is keen to change. She said: 'It's not just about being a builder on site. It's about celebrating practical achievements. 'One of the things I enjoy most about my job is that I am creating tangible things. I can show people and say ""I was part of this.""' Another female engineer keen to engage women is Roma Agrawal, a 30-year-old structural engineer who worked on the Shard skyscraper in London and appeared as one of the inspirational women on the recent M&S poster campaign. She said there was still an element of everyday sexism on building sites, but added: 'As the number of women on site is steadily increasing, it's only a matter of time before that gets stamped out.' Brunel was a stand-out even in a field of greats, accomplishing a huge amount in a relatively short lifespan . Over the course of his relatively short life, from 1806 to 1859, Brunel was responsible for building over 25 railway lines, more than 100 bridges, eight piers and docks, and three enormous steamships. He was a stand-out even in a field which included greats like George Stevenson - so-called father of the railways - and Thomas Cubitt - who helped build large parts of London, including Finsbury, Islington and Belgravia. He constructed the Great Western Railway, linking London to Bristol, built the famous Bristol Meads Station, and designed five revolutionary suspension bridges including the Clifton Suspension Bridge over the River Avon. While he is best known for his work on the railways, he was also an accomplished ship builder. He built the the 'Great Western', which launched in 1837 and was the first steamship to ferry regular passenger journies across the Atlantic Ocean. The 'Great Britain', launched in 1843, was the world's first iron-hulled, steam-powered passenger liner to use a screw-propellar, which made ti far more efficient. The 'Great Eastern', launched in 1859, was designed in cooperation with John Scott Russell, and was by far the biggest ship ever built, but was so expensive it drove its owner into bankruptcy.","Morwenna Wilson great-great granddaughter of Isambard Kingdom Brunel .

"By . Chris Pleasance . The number of Britons living in million-pound homes will soar to 500,000 by the end of the year as rising demand and foreign investment leads to a boom in the housing market. Almost 9,000 homes a month will top the £1million mark between now and December, meaning there will be 50 per cent more property millionaires than in October 2007 when the recession began. Around 35,000 homeowners have already been elevated into the millionaire's club so far this year, with the vast majority of those being in London. The number of Britons living in home worth £1million is set to increase by 9,000 every month until 2015 . So far this year 35,000 British homeowners have already seen the value of their homes top £1million, with the vast majority of those being in London (pictured) However, in signs that the house-price recovery is moving out of the capital, the south east and south west recorded large rises in the number of property millionaires, with Wales and Yorkshire also seeing small increases. According to research conducted by property website zoopla.co.uk for The Telegraph, the total number of homes valued at more than £1million grew by 34,374 in four months to the end of April to a total of 427,501. More than half of that total, 271,000, were in London, where average prices have risen to £414,490 meaning that 31,000 extra people are now inhabiting million-pound homes. The average cost of a three-bed family home in 'prime' areas of the city is now £1.67million and expected to rise to £2million by 2015, with the definition of 'prime' now includes Battersea and Clapham, not traditionally rich places. High demand and foreign investment is largely behind the spike in prices. Earlier this week an Eastern European buyer paid £140million for a penthouse at One Hyde Park (pictured), a record for a flat in Britain . The average cost of a three-bedroom home in 'prime' areas of London is expected to be £2milllion by 2015. This flat in Grosvenor Square in the most expensive per-square-foot in Mayfair, and costs a whopping total of £18million . In the UK as a whole, the average house now costs £180,000, a jump of 7.9 per cent since December last year and the largest annual rise since October 2007. The cost of an average home is now at its highest level since June 2008. In February 2013, the average price was £163,468. While demand for property is causing house values to peak across the South, the North and Midlands saw falls in the number of million-pound houses. The spike in property values is being caused by demand far outstripping supply, with foreign investors also driving values up. It is not just London that has since houses jump in price, with values rising across the south. Actress Vivien Leigh's home in Sussex recently went on sale for £3.5million . Former cricketer Graeme Swann also put his home in Lincolnshire on the market for £1.2million recently. Nearby Yorkshire and the Humber saw million-pound properties rise slightly in the last 12 months . Earlier this week Penthouse D at One Hyde Park became the most expensive flat ever sold in the UK after a wealthy Eastern European snapped up the unfurnished property for £140million. Despite the apartment having no walls or floors, it was snapped up for a record-breaking price tag, with some experts speculating it was used as a safe way for a billionaire to get money out of Russia or Ukraine as the crisis there escalates. In other cities such as Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, many new-build flats were being sold directly to Chinese investors for 25 to 30 per cent above market value . Experts have warned that such growth is not sustainable. This week the Bank of England deputy governor warned that a housing price bubble is the biggest threat to the UK recovery.","More than 500,000 Britons will be living in million-pound homes by 2015 .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Amanda Spencer, 23, arrives at Sheffield Crown Court where she was found guilty of 16 child prostitution offences against five girls - some as young as 11 . Care staff knew about the crimes of a young woman who began grooming vulnerable underage girls at the age of 15 five years before she faced justice, reports today suggest. Amanda Spencer, 23, befriended girls, some as young as 11, on the streets of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, before luring them into a life of prostitution. Spencer would offer the vulnerable girls, many of whom were in care, a shoulder to cry on - before piling them with drink and drugs and forcing them to have sex with various men. She would then become aggressive if they refused to have intercourse with men in flats around Sheffield, in the city's Castle Markets and the toilets of nearby McDonald's and KFC restaurants, the court was told. Following a six-week trial, Spencer was found guilty of 14 counts of arranging or facilitating child prostitution and two counts of causing or inciting child prostitution against five girls between 2006 and 2011. Today, it was claimed that care workers may have know about her crimes as early as June 2009 when a girl, then 14, allegedly told authorities she had been 'forced to have sex with an Asian male.' According to The Times, a confidential South Yorkshire Police report suggests staff at the teen's care home recorded she was 'very frightened of Amanda and had sex with male as Spencer said she would assault her if she did not' The newspaper suggests the 2010 report also details how the girl was forced to engage in sexual activity with Asian men for just Â£10. The girl was one of the five whose accounts of Spencer's abuse led to the 23-year-old's conviction earlier this week. Of the 14 charges she was found guilty of, four related to the 14-year-old. A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'South Yorkshire Police take child exploitation cases extremely seriously as has been demonstrated by the 3-year-long investigation into Amanda Spencer and her associates. 'We are not able to comment further on this allegedly leaked report, especially as the case may still be the subject of a serious case review.' After 30 hours of juror deliberations, Spencer was cleared of a further three counts of arranging or facilitating child prostitution and was also cleared of three counts of causing or inciting child prostitution. Spencer was cleared of trafficking within the UK for sexual exploitation along with co-accused Kareem Ahmed, 30, . One of the men Spencer forced the girls to have sex with Ian Foster, 69, was found guilty of two counts of sexual assault on underage girls and one sexual assault on an adult. A confidential police report suggests care home staff were told about Spencer's crimes by a victim, then 14, as early as June 2009. The teen was one of the five girls whose accounts led to Spencer's conviction earlier this week . Lee Unwin, 27, was cleared of paying for the sexual service of a child. Bashdar Hamadamin, 26, was cleared of a charge of rape. John McLachlan, 65, who was accused of paying for the sexual services of a child, died midway through the trial. Jurors could not reach verdicts on 14 counts against Spencer and were discharged from their duties. Spencer and Foster are to be sentenced together on May 6. Following Spencer's conviction on Thursday, Judge Michael Murphy QC remanded Spencer in custody - telling her the crimes she had been convicted of were 'very serious'. Spencer was found guilty of 14 counts of arranging or facilitating child prostitution and two counts of causing or inciting child prostitution against between 2006 and 2011 . He said: 'Expect an immediate and lengthy prison term.' Previously, Michelle Colborne, prosecuting, told the court Spencer would tell the girls to lie about their age and dress provocatively. She would then pocket the cash earned by the girls, seeing it as 'far more productive and profitable to co-ordinate a pool of prostitutes, than to work for drug money all by herself'. Miss Colborne said: 'Many of the victims in this case were in the care system or marked as ""missing from home"" at the relevant time, those still at home experiencing difficulties to varying degrees. 'All were lacking in self-esteem and the wherewithal or sense to protect themselves from exploitation.' She added: 'Amanda Spencer was a fraud, say the prosecution. She hung around the town centre identifying and befriending vulnerable children. 'She made them feel loved, she gave them a shoulder to cry on, a friend who purported to understand whatever sadness they were experiencing in their lives and in turn lured them into a life of abuse, which she exploited and profited from. 'She referred to them as her sisters or cousins when asked to account for who they were by people in authority. 'Although the children knew they were being sold for cash, their own drug and alcohol addiction sere so entrenched that they were incapable to extricate themselves. 'She told them how to dress more provocatively, to lie about their age and to close their minds to the reality of the sexual experiences, concentrating instead on the drugs. 'Those who had the temerity to refuse to do as they were instructed felt her wrath. She was violent and they were frightened of her.'

"By . Lucy Crossley . Reunited: Christopher Morgan (left) was reunited with his father Vincenzo Mirarchi (right) after more then 50 years when his daughter tracked him down via Facebook . A family have been reunited with their long-lost grandfather who disappeared more than 50 years ago after they found him living in Italy by tracking him down on Facebook. Italian-born Vincenzo Mirarchi came to England as a teenager in the 1940s before he met and married Hazell Sidwell in 1955. The couple had a son, John, but Mr Mirarchi was forced to return to Italy to help his parents before the birth of his second son, Christopher, in 1958. He lost touch with his wife and they eventually divorced, both going on to marry other people. Mr Mirarchi wrote to his sons but they never received the letters because his ex-wife's new husband intercepted them, leading them to believe that he wanted nothing to do with the family. In 1977 Mr Mirarchi returned to Coventry to find his sons, but was unable to track them down after they moved to a different part of the city. Two years ago Christopher's daughter Sian Morgan began researching her family tree and managed to trace her grandfather after finding his relatives on Facebook. And last month the family met for the first time after they travelled to Italy for an emotional reunion. 'It has been an amazing journey for all of us,' said 25-year-old Miss Morgan, who lives in Coventry. 'My dad never knew his father Vincenzo because he left England before he was born. 'It took 18 months to finally track him down and contact him. We didn’t know what his reaction would be but we were bowled over by the welcome we had from him. Happy family: Sian Morgan (left) with her father and grandfather (centre), and other members of their Italian family . Bond: Christopher and Sian Morgan with their newly rediscovered Italian family . Trip: Miss Morgan travelled with her father, 55, a project manager for a flooring company, and his 59-year-old brother John, a builder, to meet Mr Mirarchi over Easter . 'He was so happy to see us because, as he said, he feared he had lost us forever.' Miss Morgan, a hairdresser, began searching for her grandfather after hearing the story of him being forced to leave his wife and children to return to his homeland. She said: 'When I started the search, I only had his name, when he was in England, the date he married my grandmother and his date of birth from the marriage certificate. We didn’t even know if he was still alive. 'I went onto Facebook, because I thought ‘you never know’, and searched for his name but there were a lot of Mirarchis. Brothers in arms: Mir Mirarchi with Mr Morgan, and two of his other sons Givseppe and Carlo . Great grandfather: Mr Mirarchi with Miss Morgan's daughter Minnie Redmond . 'I contacted a few of them, but a lot didn’t want to know, or didn’t speak English.' Bizarrely, she finally found her grandfather, who worked as a miner and farm worker in Italy, after accidentally stumbling on a long-lost cousin with the same surname. Mother-of-one Miss Morgan added: 'The search was salvaged by a stranger called Vitaliano Mirarchi, who wanted to help even though at first he didn’t think he was connected to my grandfather. 'He had a friend in the registry office who was able to track his address down at another office and we found out he was alive and his address in Induno Olona, Varese, near Milan. Family unit: Mr Mirarchi, with his son John Morgan and wife Hazel Sidwell before he was forced to return to Italy . Background: Mr Mirarchi at a family wedding in Coventry around 60 years ago . Treasured possession: Vincenzo kept this photograph of  of his sons John and Christopher for more than 50 years before the trio were reunited . Marriage: Italian-born Mr Mirarchi came to England as a teenager in the 1940s before he met and married Hazell Sidwell in 1955 . 'The strangest thing happened when he actually discovered he was a second cousin of my grandfather. 'I got an address for my grandfather and I wrote to him telling him who I was and saying we were here if he wanted to talk to us. 'He was so pleased when he got the letter he cried when he opened it. It was lovely. He said he had never stopped looking for us and invited us to meet him.' Emotional: Mr Morgan meeting his father Mr Mirarchi for the first time at Milan airport . Miss Morgan travelled with her father, 55, a project manager for a flooring company, and his 59-year-old brother John, a builder, to meet Mr Mirarchi over Easter. 'We flew out on Good Friday and stayed for five nights and the whole thing was just wonderful,' she said. 'My dad was so emotional, and he looks the spitting image of his father, it was amazing. 'He used to write letters to his wife and children from Italy all the time, but my step-grandfather wasn't a nice man and used to rip up those letters before my gran read them. Embrace: Miss Morgan with her grandfather and his wife Maria, who is pictured right hugging Mr Morgan . Dream: Miss Morgan, pictured right with daughter Minnie, said meeting her extended family was a 'dream come true' Great uncle: Mr Morgan's half brother Givseppe with baby Minnie . 'As a result they never knew he had always tried to stay in touch with them. 'The whole thing is an absolute dream, it really is all my dreams come true.' Mr Morgan added: 'I don't remember him at all and when I was six and my brother was nine our mum had remarried and we changed our name. 'I think dad sent us letters but we never got them. 'It was very strange to think we would meet him and I felt very nervous about it. 'My mum and step-dad are dead now so meeting dad answered many questions I had.'

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Daniel Perry took his own life after he was blackmailed by people online - who told him they would show compromising pictures to his family unless he gave them money . The death of a Scottish teenager who took his own life after he was blackmailed online has led to the arrest of a Filipino gang who duped hundreds of victims in to exposing themselves on the internet. Daniel Perry, 17, a mechanic from Fife, jumped off a bridge when people online threatened to send compromising images of him to his family and friends unless he paid them. Daniel's death prompted a large-scale police inquiry by investigators from Interpol, the US Department of Homeland Security, plus police Scotland and other forces. Now, at least 58 Filipino suspects have been arrested after the investigators traced online activity from some of their victims' computers, Philippine National Police chief Allan Purisima said. At least three of those are believed to have been directly involved in blackmailing Daniel. Over 260 computers, phones and pornographic materials and other evidence was seized in the Philippines by 15 police teams. Mr Purisima said the syndicate would secretly record the victims after tricking them into exposing their bodies or having cybersex. They would then threaten to send the video to their relatives and friends unless they paid anything from $500 (£292) to $2,000 (£1,100) he said. He added members of the group would create fake Facebook accounts of fictitious young and attractive women to entice and lure victims with pornographic materials after striking up online chats with them. Assistant Chief Constable Malcolm Graham, Major Crime and Public Protection, said: 'Daniel's death last year led to a major criminal inquiry which ultimately led officers to the Philippines. 'The enforcement action over the past two days by the Philippines National Police has been supported by Police Scotland. 'We have had officers in Manila observing and assisting in the past few days, working with a wide range of partners including Interpol, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Philippines National Police and CEOP and law enforcement from other countries. Daniel's death led to a large-scale international investigation - which saw 58 Filipinos arrested this week. Officials say those arrested are believed to have posed as attractive women online to lure people in . 'Our message is clear: Our focus is on keeping people safe and there is no hiding place - anywhere in the world - if you are a criminal and you undertake this type of activity, which preys on those who might be the most vulnerable and susceptible to coercion and blackmail. 'A young Scottish teenager lost his life as a result of this online activity. The impact on his family, friends and wider community cannot be imagined. 'I hope that the efforts of law enforcement and our partners in Scotland and globally helps to provide some reassurance to Daniel's family and the wider public that we are determined to tackle this type of criminality.' Detective Chief Inspector Gary Cunningham, of Specialist Crime Division Major Investigation Team East, led the investigation into Daniel's death. He travelled to Manila to liaise with the authorities in the Philippines. He said: 'Daniel was a victim of a crime which uses threat and intimidation to coerce people into parting with money. At least of three of those arrested by the team - which included members from Interpol - are believed to have been involved in victimising Daniel, pictured. 260 computers and scores of pornographic material was seized in 15 raids of suspects in the past week . 'This is an organised criminal activity, which is there for one reason - to generate profit by exploiting the vulnerability of others. 'It's an abhorrent crime and in this case a young man lost his life, which is something his family and friends have to live with. We have been thorough and relentless in our pursuit of answers to why Daniel died.' Sanjay Virmani, director the Interpol . Digital Crime Center based in Singapore, said the victims were from the . Asia, Europe and the United States. He said that the extortionists had been tracked down using evidence from computers and intelligence information from police. A police spokesman said the impact on Daniel's family 'cannot be imagined' - but that he hoped the arrested would provide 'reassurance' to those who knew him . Warning . those still engaged in cyber extortion in the Philippines and elsewhere . in the world, Virmani said: 'You better be prepared for the . consequences of your actions because as you can see we have made a . commitment to work together. 'You will be caught and you will be held accountable for your actions.' 'This is not an issue directly involving the Philippines exclusively,' British Ambassador to Manila Asif Ahmad said. 'Cybercrime . is international, and is an international problem, it respects no . nationality or borders. We are all potential victims of cybercrime, none . of us are immune.'

"By . Ted Thornhill . With echoes of hit film Runaway Bride, seven Chinese farmers from the same area have been left single after their mail-order brides all fled the country together. They fared slightly better than the men in the 1999 film, though, which sees bride Maggie Carpenter, played by Julia Roberts, leave several grooms at the altar. The farmers at least tied the knot with the women they bought from Vietnam. Deception: Three of the Vietnamese  brides who married Chinese farmers and then fled . Scam: According to local authorities the gullible guys are the latest case of desperate men believing that they can buy love on the internet . Attractive: Two of the brides pose for a photograph in a field . Out of pocket: The invoice for one of the brides . But the marriages didn’t last long, with the women fleeing after just seven days. The fiasco has left the farmers seriously out of pocket, as they’d each paid around 50,000 RMB – or £5,000 – for their wives . According to local authorities the gullible guys are just the latest case of desperate men often from rural areas believing that they can buy love on the internet. The websites show attractive women, and promise good housekeeping and cooking skills, but officials warn that at the end of the day it is all about women who are controlled by greedy commercial agencies that pay them commissions for the number of men they wed. Hu Peng, 46, was one of the seven in southern China's Jiangxi province who became a victim of the Vietnamese vixens. And now his new wife, like the other brides, has vanished. ‘Getting a woman from Vietnam is popular around here,’ said Peng. ‘The women are considered faithful, kind, considerate and good housekeepers. It is hard to find a Chinese woman - the strict one-child birth policy means that most Chinese families only want a son.’ This policy has been implicated in an increase in the number of killings of newborn girls and forced abortions in the country since it was introduced in 1979. Peng went on: ‘I found this woman through an agency and I thought she was lovely. We married two days after being introduced. I borrowed the money to pay the agency 50,000 RMB (£5,000). ‘For a couple of days all was blissful. I went out to work and I left her at home, stitching, cleaning, making the evening meal. It was just as I expected things to be. Heartbroken: The mother of one of the heartbroken grooms holds up a photograph of him on his wedding day, pictured with a bride that would leave him days later . Generosity: A woman holds up clothes that were bought for one of the brides . ‘I knew my wife was friendly with the other brides in the area. She said that on such-and-such a day they would all be going out for a girls' shopping trip. But it was one she never came home from - and neither did the other brides. ‘It was all a con. They upped sticks and left en-masse. My wife took away a lot of my money and the lovely clothes and gifts I had bought for her as a token of my love as we started our new life together.’ He and the others who were duped have now reported their losses to the local police, who have started an enquiry.","Seven Chinese farmers ordered Vietnamese brides from the internet .

He went over to speak with neighbour Meng Tuan, 30, but claims he was slapped, pushed and threatened by a drunk crowd before spotting the toddler . Wang went next door to confront his neighbour, Meng Tuan, 30, but found he was in the middle of a large family celebration for his brother's 40th birthday. However the partygoers, who witnesses say had been drinking, didn't take kindly to the interruption and began insulting Wang. They laughed at him and threatened him.

'We do not consider it an act of pre-meditated violence, but it was an assault,' said a police spokesman. 'This man was feeling threatened and looking for a way out. Unfortunately, the innocent baby was seriously injured as a result.' The baby suffered multiple fractures and was taken to hospital. At first doctors feared for his life but later he was declared out of danger. The police spokesman added that Cheng was under arrest along with the family of the baby, who are facing a probe for assault and criminal damage. In a violent act, Wang takes hold of the boy, swings his arms backwards, then hurls the child into the air . The boy suffered fractured bones and was taken to hospital in serious condition, but his injuries are not thought to be life-threatening (pictured, the moment Wang releases the boy in midair)","Cheng Wang, 38, threw one-year-old child into the air during a row .

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . Some will take to PlayStation to fill in the down time. Others will be downloading TV hits such as Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones. And their manager, well known for his literary tastes, will in all likelihood curl up with  a John Updike or Philip Roth novel. But however England’s 23 players choose to pass the time between training and performing at the World Cup in Brazil next month, manager Roy Hodgson says he is not expecting to hear complaints from his squad about boredom or homesickness. With 29 days to go until the squad depart for their Miami training base before moving on to Rio, and with the England squad to be announced on Monday week, Hodgson has sent the clearest message yet regarding the attitude and behaviour he expects from his team in Brazil. Scroll down for videos... Don't you dare! England boss Roy Hodgson doesn't expect England players to complain of boredom . Bad attitude: Hodgson believes that complaining of boredom during the World Cup is a 'silly excuse' Hodgson’s law means there will be no room for sulking or moodiness during the World Cup campaign. Despite the fact that the previous campaign in South Africa was marred by grumbles about the  remote training ground in Rustenburg, where players had little to do, Hodgson will have no sympathy for any squad members who suggest they are unhappy. That is partly because England have reversed their policy of using secluded training bases and are staying in the beachside Royal Tulip Hotel in Rio and training at Urca Military base, beneath the landmark Sugarloaf Mountain. Principally, though, it is because Hodgson does not buy into the idea that players cannot cope with long periods of enforced inactivity between training and games. ‘It’s a complete nonsense,’ said Hodgson. ‘It’s one of those silly excuses that people use. You really cannot have that attitude. ‘I don’t think it’s our job to keep the players occupied. I think when you sign up for the World Cup you sign up for the World Cup as it’s going to be. Not bad for some: England's Royal Tulip hotel has spectacular views of Sugarloaf Mountain . Broadening horizons: England players visited Schindler's Factory museum during Euro 2012 in Poland/Ukraine . 1 Does he go with 107-cap Ashley Cole (below, right) or the youthful verve of Luke Shaw, 19 (right), voted the best left-back in the country? 2 With Kyle Walker out, does Hodgson bring in Kyle Naughton or Nathaniel Clyne as back-up for Glen Johnson — or take seven defenders and trust Phil Jones or Chris Smalling to step in? 3 Could John Stones squeeze in after an impressive few months at Everton? 4 In midfield, does Hodgson go for Michael Carrick to steady the ship or Ross Barkley to add to his attacking options? 5 Up front, does he pick Rickie Lambert — if only for the fact he has never missed a penalty — or give Jermain Defoe, now with Toronto FC, one last hurrah? ‘You know from May 19, hopefully through to the final, you’re going to be away, you’ll be with another group of players and  maybe there will be only one training session a day,  so there will be a lot of  free time. ‘You’re not going to be with your wife, you’re going to see your kids. This is something you sign up for. And once you sign up for that, you shouldn’t then be saying: “Oh, I’m missing my family; oh I’m bored. What can you do to help me?” Because there’s nothing we can do to help you.’ England have lurched between polar opposite approaches to the base camp in past World Cup finals. In Germany 2006, they resembled a travelling circus, when wives and girlfriends took over Baden-Baden, with daily parties and regular contact with players making England a laughing stock to other nations. Circus: The England WAGs came out in force during the 2006 World Cup in Baden Baden, Germany . Spartan: England players complained of boredom under Fabio Capello's strict regime in South Africa 2010 . Current England coach Gary Neville was part of that squad and criticised the arrangements. In South Africa, manager Fabio Capello picked one of the most remote training grounds possible in Rustenburg, with all facilities on site, so there was no need or even any temptation to go off site — although for several players that proved too stifling and lacking  in stimulation. At Euro 2012 under Hodgson, the FA instigated  a policy of staying in city-centre hotels and allowing players more freedom. Squad members were regularly seen strolling through Krakow and eating out at nearby restaurants. In Rio, as well as the usual array of PlayStation games, table tennis, pool and TV downloads, players will be allowed to unwind over a round of golf on the 18-hole course adjacent to their Royal Tulip base. ‘We’ll put on the same as every other team,’ said Hodgson. Right on course: A round of golf is likely to be a popular pastime among players in Brazil . ‘There will be leisure activities, they’ll get free time in the afternoon. If they want to have a game of golf, listen  to their music or watch a video on TV, they can. ‘But what we can’t reproduce is that you go to training in the morning and then you go home to your wife and family and do whatever you want to do  for the rest of the day. It’s  a World Cup. So I’ve got no truck with that whatsoever. ‘If I got the 30 players together and told them, “Right, we’re going to be living together, we’re not going to be training every minute of the day, there’ll be free time and you’ve got to find a way of using that free time. Out of you 30 here, put your hands up if you don’t fancy that?” — there wouldn’t be one. Get on with it! The England manager argues that players must have boredom to deal with in everyday life . ‘They’re all going to say, “Yeah, we understand that, we want to go. It’s been my dream. All my life I’ve dreamed it”. ‘Unfortunately, no one will say that in advance, and then some of them will go to the World Cup and play badly and say to you guys, “I was bored”. And you’ll write, “Poor fella”. ‘It’s like a soldier signing up for the army, then saying, “I’m a bit bored sitting around these barracks every day with nothing to do”. They must have plenty of boredom in their lives but they cope with it.’","Roy Hodgson doesn't expect England players to complain of boredom .

"First impressions of Rio de Janeiro for the England players when they touch down to begin their World Cup adventure this summer will be favourable to say the least. Overlooking the luxurious Royal Tulip is a stunning beach with swaying palm trees, crystal blue waters and an endless procession of bikini-clad girls sashaying across the sand. But should they, or any England supporters making the trip out to follow their team, head inland from the idyllic beachfront, they risk experiencing an altogether different and disturbing atmosphere. The stinking filth and squalor of the biggest shanty town in South America spilling down the hillside less than half a mile away is now also synonymous with violence and multiple deaths, just weeks before the World Cup comes to town. Lions' Den: The England team's World Cup hotel will be overlooked by the fearsome Rocinha shanty town . Idyllic: While the view from England's plush hotel is the stuff of dreams, it's a different experience inland . Ghetto: Over 200,000 people live in the Rocinha favela and there a nightly gun fights between police and gangs . Hands up: An undercover female detective on patrol in the Rocinha favela as police tackle drug gangs . Patrol: Heavily armed police officers monitor the favela to prevent the gangs from taking control . The Rocinha favela is a place where crackling gunfire lights up the night sky, and where police death squads and drug gangs battle for control of the sewage-filled streets. There has been an orgy of extra-judicial killing by Brazil’s military police – the result of a government crackdown to ‘pacify’ the favelas before the world’s media arrive. Last week a popular local DJ was murdered by police just feet from Rio’s famed Copacabana Beach, leading to violent demonstrations. On Monday nine buses were set on fire in protest at police brutality. Seven police officers have died in clashes since the start of the year. Rocinha is a maze of haphazard steps carved into the hillside leading to a muddle of one-bedroom shanty homes made from breeze blocks where 200,000 deprived and desperate Rio citizens live. Stalls sell live chickens next to dead ones and fly-covered fruit and veg. There is a ceaseless cacophony of motorcycle horns, loud music and yelling voices. Inside every shack, no matter how tiny, families crowd around television screens. Eighteen-year-old Amarildo de Souza Jr is among them. His father was snatched by police who mistook him for a drug dealer, then killed him. Violence: Human rights activists have complained that the police have gone overboard to pacify the favelas . The death last year of Amarildo Sr, a 42-year-old bricklayer, is now a cause celebre.Some 25 officers including the head of the favela’s police force are standing trial. Officers are said to have tasered, strangled and then drowned their victim during a  40-minute torture session before dumping the body in a nearby forest. His son tells me: ‘Dad would have been just another statistic, except the favela rose up.’ The protest spawned riots across Brazil and led to three deaths when police fired on rioters.Amarildo Jr continues: ‘The case got so much publicity they had to charge the cops. I hope they go to jail but Brazil is a corrupt country. The police have a licence to kill. The World Cup will come and go but the violence will remain.’ Clandestine police ‘body dumps’ have sprung up. One notorious dumping ground – Grumari Forest – has been given the gruesome nickname ‘the microwave’ because of reports of nightly fires and the smell of burning flesh. One witness who spoke on condition of anonymity said: ‘The police cars enter without lights. We hear gunfire. One time we found four bodies riddled with bullets. We found a hand sticking up from the ground.’ When Brazil was awarded the tournament in 2007 the government introduced a programme to ‘pacify’ hundreds of favelas. Officials refuse to reveal the numbers who have died since the ‘clean-up’ operation started, but in Rocinha alone ten men have been killed since January. Now the authorities are promising to ‘secure’ the slums using an elite military police squad called BOPE, a shadowy organisation of highly-trained special forces whose logo is a dagger piercing a skull. Tackle: The Brazilian government began 'cleaning up' favelas in 2007, as soon as they were awarded World Cup . Last week Maria de Fatima da Silva, 56, buried her only son Douglas Rafael, 26, a popular DJ and dancer after he was killed by police in the Pavao-Pavaozinho favela which overlooks Copacabana Beach. Police are thought to have mistaken him for a drug dealer. Maria says: ‘The police told me he had fallen and died but when I saw his body in the morgue I found a bullet hole in his back. The only reason I got his body back was that people filmed the cops on cellphones. Otherwise he would have “disappeared” along with all the others.’ She adds: ‘There will be blood on the streets during the World Cup, be sure of it.’ The number of registered ‘disappearances’ in Rio has surged from 3,997 in 2009 to 6,004 last year. Amnesty International spokesman Alexandre Ciconello said: ‘The government is trying to paint a pretty picture for the world saying things have been cleaned up and that Brazil is safe for tourists. But the reality is far darker.’","Heavily armed police have been engaged in nightly gun fights with drug gangs in Rochina favela .

"By . Dan Waddell . It is one of the lesser known but more remarkable facts in the annals of cricketing history that Adolf Hitler once took an interest in the game – then fell out with it decisively. This was witnessed at first-hand by British Army officers held prisoner in Germany during the First World War, who met the then corporal and were surprised to find him asking for an explanation of the rules. A few days later, Hitler returned to announce that he had been training a team of Germans and wanted to play the English at the earliest opportunity. The scores are unknown. Welcome: A Berlin newspaper reports the arrival of the team for the three-day test match in August 1937 . Alas, Hitler found the sport insufficiently violent for the prime of German volk. In particular, it was ‘unmanly’ for batsmen to wear pads to protect their legs. And so it came to be that, for disciples of National Socialism, cricket was not just English, but effeminate. It is not as if the Nazis were fans of modern sport in any form. Once in power, they legalised sabre-duelling, where the object was to inflict a scar on your opponent’s face. With war clouds gathering, the decision by Nazi Reichssportführer, Hans von Tschammer und Osten, a close friend of Hitler, to invite a touring English cricket team to Berlin is something of a mystery. Yet in August 1937, after travelling by ship, the Prince Baudouin, from Dover to Ostend, and then by train to Berlin, The Gentlemen of Worcestershire found themselves in the city for the start of a three-match series. The matches took place on a bumpy football pitch with a thin strip of matting to serve as a wicket. First, however, there was a local custom to observe. Shortly before 11.30am, the two teams stood in a line facing one another on the outfield. Once in place, German captain Gerhard Thamer shouted: ‘Worcestershire Gentlemen, Sieg… ’ Hitler, posing in a pre-war photo, harboured a brief fascination with cricket despite Nazi Germany's penchant for more violent sports . ‘Heil!’ barked members of the Berlin team in perfect unison, their arm raised in salute. The Gents were keen to be courteous. Their Captain, Major Maurice Jewell, cleared his throat, and in rather less strident tones than Thamer, said: ‘Berlin CC, Sieg… ’ ‘Heil,’ came the rather uncertain response from his men. The Gents would later claim that whenever someone offered them the Nazi salute, they responded by lifting their hats, which indicates a desire to rewrite history somewhat. The Gents were independent men  of leisure or successful businessmen. In the 1930s they had been made welcome in the Netherlands, Portugal and Denmark, though at a fairground in Copenhagen they were banned from the coconut shy after winning all the prizes. The club was formed in the 1880s, around the same time as Worcestershire County Cricket Club and by many of the same people. On July 31, 1937, Berrow’s Worcestershire Journal announced that ‘a team of Worcestershire Gentlemen leaves shortly for Berlin, for ten days’ cricket in the capital’. The team comprised Major Jewell, R. G. W. Berkeley, C. S. Anton, W. Deeley, G. S. Tomkinson, R. H. Williams, C. G. D. Smith, H. T. H. Foley, M. Jewell,  R. Whetherly, C. Terry, P. Huntington-Whiteley and P. Robinson. Major Jewell was the son of the British Vice-Consul in the port of Iquique in Chile, and a former captain of Worcestershire, while the Huntington-Whiteleys were minor aristocracy who kept an early but fearsomely accurate bowling machine in their conservatory. The P. Huntington-Whiteley playing for the Gents was the great-great-uncle of supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. For all the Third Reich’s loathing  of the game, cricket and Germany shared a secret history. The first detailed guide to the game was printed in Bavaria in 1796, part of a snappily titled collection called Games And Exercises For The Relaxation Of The Body And The Mind For Young People, Their Instructors And All Friends  Of The Innocent Joys Of Youth. Germany played France in an unofficial Test in Hamburg in 1865, although both teams were filled with English amateurs. By the late 1880s, a small group of Berliners had started playing and, over time, the sport had gained enough credibility to attract some Germanic orderliness. Richard Williams batting for the Gents during the match, which took place on a bumpy football pitch with a thin strip of matting to serve as a wicket . When the German authorities decided to classify various sports and activities, cricket received the highest ranking: Schlagball erster Klasse. The Germans were keen to stamp their own identity on the game –  a batsman became Schlagmann, a bowler became Ballmann, the wicket was known as Tor, and the umpire was the Schiedsrichter. Both teams were required to line up 15 minutes before the match for an inspection. The sport continued to develop in the early 20th Century. The Berlin League was created and boasted 14 teams at the height of its popularity. In 1911, Leicester Cricket Club became the first English team to visit Germany, led by peace activist the Reverend Frank Seaward Beddow. His team won all four matches comfortably. The Fuhrer thought that it was unmanly for players to wear pads . A grand banquet followed and the merriment spilled from the clubhouse on to the field. Mr Beddow stood up to thank his hosts, but was interrupted and told that giving a speech in an open space was illegal and he was liable for a 20 mark fine. The Worcestershire Gents were strictly amateur, yet the tour was a serious matter. The request had come from the German authorities and two of the three matches were seen, by Berliners at least, as unofficial Tests. The rising stakes created enough concern for the then chairman of England’s Test selectors, Sir Pelham ‘Plum’ Warner, to warn Jewell that he’d rather they didn’t lose and hand the Nazis a propaganda coup. It was no surprise that all three games went to the Gents, mainly because the German batting was lamentable – in one innings they were dismissed for a paltry 19 runs. The Gents were struck by several odd features of the German approach. Particularly disconcerting was the cry of ‘Aus!’ from the whole fielding side whenever the ball struck a pad. The Gents were of a generation that appealed only for certainties, and even then it was the job of the bowler and wicketkeeper to make an enquiry to the umpire. Another shock was the casual violence meted out on the field of play. Journey into the unknown: They took the Prince Baudouin to Ostend then went to Berlin by train for the tour . German captain Thamer spent the series castigating his players for errors and screaming his frustration whenever a chance went begging. During one match, a young team-mate dropped two catches so Thamer casually walked over to him and sent him crashing to the floor with a right hook. The game continued as the poor fielder writhed about on the grass. When, the story was reported later to Tschammer und Osten, the Reichssportführer, replied: ‘Yes, I have heard about it. But I understand it was a very simple catch.’ It is hardly a surprise that some of the Gents started to feel a nagging disquiet: SS men patrolling the streets, buildings festooned with Nazi flags, and anti-Semitic signs all made them uneasy. Even more alarmingly, the sound of machine-guns being fired could be heard. Mr Beddow stood up to thank his hosts, . but was interrupted and told that giving a speech in an open space was . illegal . Senior Gents sensed something was ‘odd’ and they concluded on their return to Britain that Nazi Germany was a ‘strange country’. So why did the Germans allow a group of gentlemen from the Malverns to play cricket in their capital? It seems likely that the regime was keen to cash in on the propaganda success of the previous year’s Olympic Games in Berlin. So when the Gentlemen of Worcestershire accepted the invitation, they were treated like special envoys. Certainly they made a good impression in the city. Their arrival in Berlin was widely reported, while on their departure, Die Fußball-Woche wrote: ‘Auf Wiedersehen, Good Fellows.’ The paper expressed hope that the visitors were returning home with a more positive impression of Germany than the one reported in the British media. The Gents arrived during Nazi celebrations of Berlin's 700th birthday in August 1937 . The Reichssportführer announced that he wanted German exchange students in Britain to be initiated into the ‘Mysterien des Kricket’. But on March 12, 1938, the Wehrmacht marched into Hitler’s homeland, Austria. The Sudetenland was occupied that October, and in September 1939, Hitler invaded Poland. He didn’t even have the decency to wait until the end of the cricket season. Two days later, Britain and France declared war on Germany. This pretty much marked an end to organised cricket in Germany. The blazing summer of 1937 when Englishmen played friendly games now seems a lifetime ago. © Dan Waddell.

It's not often a shark finds itself on the menu, but this whitetip reef shark was knocked a rung or two down the food chain when a hungry (and bigger) beast decided to take a bite out of it. The deep-sea predator launched the vicious attack on its smaller tank-mate at the Aqua World aquarium in Oarai, Japan. But after a 40-minute battle to try and swallow the fish, the nine-foot sand tiger spat out his smaller cousin because it found it too chewy. Sharky and gorge: The tiger shark at the Aqua World aquarium in Oarai, in Ibaraki Prefecture, had been worrying staff by its lack of interest in its food . Staff at the aquarium said they were shocked when their star-attraction tried to eat the smaller whitetip reef shark, with the animals usually so well fed that they ignore their tank mates entirely. But the sand tiger had not been eating in recent weeks, with staff concerned over its apparent lack of appetite. But that changed when it decided to make a smaller tank-mate breakfast. A caretaker doing his early morning rounds saw that the nine-foot long shark had began biting the whitetip and immediately called keepers for help. After trying several times to bite a chunk out of its smaller relative and failing because if its thick skin, the shark gave up and tried to swallow the smaller shark whole. The bemused caretaker witnessed a titanic 40 minute struggle between the two predators of the deep before the tiger shark gave up the fight and spat out his prey in disgust. Shark's worse that its bite: After trying several times to bite a chink out of its smaller relative and failing because if its thick skin, the shark gave up and tried to swallow the smaller shark whole . Staff managed to rescue the injured whitetip and pull it to safety, but it was so badly mauled it later died from its wounds. 'In light of this event, we will be further increasing the effort we make when judging which sharks to place in the same tanks, taking into account their relative size and possible hostilities,' a spokesperson for the aquarium said. In the meantime, Aqua World hopes visitors 'will continue to support the facility and its Sea of Sharks exhibit.'","The attack happened at Aqua World aquarium in Oarai, Japan .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . A blonde model with blue eyes will say a prayer for Ayrton Senna on Thursday. It is the same ritual Adriane Galisteu has practised on each of the 19 previous anniversaries of the driver's death. A person of faith like Senna - 'I believe in the Lord' - she has spoken to Sportsmail about that weekend 20 years ago when the Williams her boyfriend was driving crashed into a concrete wall at Tamburello curve at Imola, killing him. She remembers the last hours spent at Senna's villa in the Algarve in the countdown to the San Marino Grand Prix. Black day: Ayrton Senna with his girlfriend Adriane Galisteu, and right, the blonde model cries at his funeral . Crash: Senna's death on lap seven of the San Marino Grand Prix, 20 years ago, rocked the sporting world . 'He phoned me,' she says. 'He was not well. His head was not right. 'Rubens Barrichello, his good friend, was in hospital (after an accident in Friday practice). He was very upset by the death of Roland Ratzenberger, a fellow driver who died on Saturday (in qualifying). He told me, ""I'm very sad"". 'I had known him anguished before but never heard his voice like it was that day. I remember telling him, ""Ayrton, don't enter that race"".' The advice Galisteu gave Senna, the thrice world champion and arguably the greatest driver of all time, echoed the words of Professor Sid Watkins, the Brazilian's friend and Formula One's medical delegate as well as one of the world's leading brain surgeons. He told him to pack it all in and 'let's go fishing'. While Senna was undoubtedly emotional having visited the site of Ratzenberger's crash, there is a suggestion that his relationship with Galisteu itself was preying on his mind. In Ayrton, o Heroi Revelado (Ayrton, the Hero Revealed), author Ernesto Rodrigues claims that Galisteu had contacted her former lover and that Senna's brother, Leonardo, had played tapes of these secret conversations to him. Champagne moment: Senna, seen here celebrating his famous win at Monaco in 1992, won three world titles . The author, a former London bureau chief of Brazil's Globo TV channel, visited seven countries and spoke to 213 people during two years researching the book. However, Senna's sister Viviane has denied that any member of the family talked to Rodrigues. 'My goal is not to talk about a book that I haven't read,' Viviane once said, growing upset when pressed on the claims about Galisteu's behaviour. I put the accusation to Galisteu herself. 'It never happened, no. I was 100 per cent honest with Ayrton. I recall his skin and his smell. I only told him truths. I was a young girl and shortly after I first knew him I took him home to get to know my mum and my brother, the place where I lived and how I lived.' She says that she fell in love with him when they met at the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix, where she was an umbrella girl. She had long admired him from afar but never imagined they would become lovers. Determined: Senna, pictured here on the day before he died, was said to have been 'not right' prior to the race . 'When I tried to tell him not to race at Imola, he told me that he loved his profession and he couldn't just pull out of the race,' she remembers. ""It is my life"". His strong inclination to race is corroborated by Senna's manager, Julian Jakobi, one of the most respected figures in the paddock. He told me that, though Senna was upset like everyone else by the events of the weekend, he spoke to Frank Williams, the team boss, and decided to compete. 'Stories saying he did not want to race are simply not true,' said Jakobi. Back in Portugal, Galisteu watched the race on TV. 'I saw the accident and thought nothing of it,' she said. 'In fact, I thought, ""Good, he'll be back early, thank goodness"". 'But then I saw it was more serious than I first imagined. I stood in front of the TV and watched the replay over and over again. I could see the car was damaged but I never thought he had died. On the podium: Nicola Larini, Michael Schumacher and Flavio Briatore react to the news of Senna's death . 'I answered the phone and it was the wife of his best friend telling me I must get over to Imola. We went on a private jet from Lisbon. I got on the plane thinking he was still alive; hurt but not killed.' Back at Imola, Senna had been taken out of the car and flown to hospital. After a 37-minute delay, the race restarted, to be won by Michael Schumacher, who was driving in  a Benetton believed by Senna to have flouted that season's new rules outlawing traction control. No champagne was sprayed on the podium. 'When the plane was about to take off, the pilot said there was a call from the tower. I imagined it was Ayrton saying, ""You don't need to come, everything is OK"". 'It was a friend: ""Adriane, you don't need to come"". ""Wow, that's good"", I said, thinking he must be improving. ""No, he's dead"". My world stopped at that moment. 'In my head it was impossible: he could only die of old age. It was incredible that he died doing what he knew best in life. It was very difficult for Brazil, for the whole world, but even more for me. It took me many years to recover my life, especially amorously.' Galisteu, seen here in 2009, claimed Senna wanted to end his career with the famous Italian outfit Ferrari .

Galisteu, who has just turned 41, married Alexandre Iodice in June 2010 and has a three-year-old son, Vittorio. 'My time with Ayrton was a great love story. He was loved across the world more than he ever knew. His memory will never be erased. For me, it was special, but now I am married and have a child. It means I cannot say he was the love of my life.' She remembers the remarkable funeral in Sao Paulo, when the whole sprawling city stopped to mourn its icon: the brooding, brilliant, ruthless, clever, mystical, megalomaniacal Senna. 'I spent as long as I could with his body. I didn't go home. I didn't wash. I stayed with him. 'Ayrton had three dreams,' she says fondly. 'The first was to finish his career at Ferrari; the second was to get to know Disneyworld; the third was to become a father. 'He was more than a champion. He had an enormous heart, a simple way of life and had simple dreams. He was entertaining. At home, he was like a child. He was full of happiness.' Star man: Senna won 41 races and secured 65 poles during a career which promised so much more . Senna's death shook Formula One more profoundly than that of any other. Before the Austrian rookie Ratzenberger, no driver had died for 12 years. Niki Lauda, the three-time world champion, said: 'God has had his hand over Formula One for a long time. This weekend, he took it away.' Secondly, the whole dramatic scene was beamed around the world on TV, giving it a global impact never known before. Murray Walker later described it as the hardest commentary of his life, treading a fine line between empty optimism and morbid fatalism as he watched, unable to know precisely how serious Senna's predicament was. In Imola, today and for the next four days, there will be races in honour of the man who won 41 races and 65 poles. His death prompted safety provisions that have ensured no driver has died in a Formula One cockpit since. Wheel-to-wheel: Senna and Nigel Mansell fight for first place at the 1991 Spanish Grand Prix . Less favourably, his ruthlessness on track - most notably in driving Alain Prost off in 1990 - set the tempo for some of the less chivalrous driving that followed. (In fairness, as McLaren boss Ron Dennis observed, Senna's superlative talent and mercilessness was matched and abetted by Prost in their glorious rivalry.) The most intriguing question is raised by Bernie Ecclestone's trial in Germany and the doubts it prompts over the 83-year-old's future at the head of Formula One: could Senna have taken over from Bernie? Senna was clever, calculating, sharp, cowed by nobody and saw commercial opportunities way ahead of his time. Just before he died, he struck a deal with Audi to import their road cars. The arrangement stood until Audi opened a factory in Brazil in 1999. He even caused Ecclestone to change the terms of the super licence by doing a deal with Sega before a pan-F1 contract had been signed with Nintendo. From then on, Ecclestone ensured that a driver's electronic media rights were signed over to him. We mourn the loss of a driver of sublime brilliance. Perhaps we join Adriane in saying a prayer for him. But we should also ponder the role he might now be taking on in Formula One but for that afternoon at Imola.","Adriane Galisteu said she asked Ayrton Senna to withdraw from the ill-fated San Marino Grand Prix .

"By . Bianca London . Have you got an old string of granny's pearls sitting in a drawer somewhere? Well you might just want to dig them out! That's because rare pearl worn as one of a pair of earrings for years has just sold at auction for a world record £811,000. It was worn as jewellery by a lady who had absolutely no idea how much it was worth and two large round pearls made up the earrings that had been given to her as a gift by her husband. Scroll down for video . The Mother of pearls: Jewellery expert Marielle Whiting examines the largest natural round pearl in the world, which was discovered after an unsuspecting punter took an old pair of earrings into Wooley and Wallis auctioneers in Salisbury, Wilts - it sold at auction for £811,000 . He later showed them to experts who identified one of the gems as a natural pearl. The other was a more common cultured pearl that would have been produced by an oyster farmer in controlled conditions and was not valuable. The natural pearl had a diameter of 17.4mm and is the largest of its kind to have ever come up for auction. Experts from Woolley and Wallis Auctioneers of Salisbury, Wilts, gave it a pre-sale estimate of £120,000. Astonishing discovery: Sharp-eyed expert Johnathan Edwards realised that what was thought to be a relatively valueless cultured pearl may actually be an enormous natural one, and immediately sent it off to boffins in Switzerland to have it analysed . Expert advice: The experts in Switzerland confirmed that the 33.14ct natural gem is the largest round pearl ever to be offered at auction and would have taken around 100 years to develop in the oysters shell . But competitive bidding drove the hammer price up to £680,000. With all the fees added on, the overall price paid was £811,600 and it was bought by renowned international jewellers David Morris of London's Bond Street. It will now be made into a necklace for a potential buyer in Hong Kong. Jonathan Edwards, head of the jewellery department at Woolley and Wallis, said: 'The pearl came in from a private source and was presented as part of a pair of drop earrings. She had no idea! The rare pearl was worn as one of a pair of earrings for years by an unsuspecting woman whose husband gave them to her as a gift . Stunning: Experts from Woolley and Wallis Auctioneers of Salisbury, Wilts, gave it a pre-sale estimate of £120,000 but they couldn't believe it when the final agreed price amassed to nearly £1m . Limited edition: The pearl is going to be made into a necklace as part of a collection of pearl jewellery for a potential customer in Hong Kong . 'I looked at them and it seemed as though one of them might be a natural pearl, which are worth considerably more than cultured pearls. 'I thought there was a difference between the two because one had an outer layer of about one milimetre thick, but the other seemed to be solid. 'It is very difficult to tell if a pearl is cultured or natural by looking at it and you can never be 100 per cent sure unless you have it X-rayed. 'We had it X-rayed at a London lab and they said it was natural, and we then sent it to a lab in Switzerland who said the same thing.' Who would have thought it? The 33.14ct round pearl was produced by a gold lip oyster and would have taken around 10 years to develop in the wild, experts say . Phoebe Morris, from David Morris jewellers, added: 'The pearl is going to be made into a necklace as part of a collection of pearl jewellery we have been putting together for some time. 'We have a potential buyer for it in Hong Kong.' The 33.14ct round pearl was produced by a gold lip oyster - Pinctada maxima in Latin - and would have taken around 10 years to develop in the wild. A pearl is produced within the soft tissue of a living shelled mollusc . Pearls that occur spontaneously in the wild - or 'natural pearls' - are rare but extremely valuable and are made up of nearly 100 per cent calcium carbonate and conchiolin . They come in a variety of shapes but, obviously, the rounder they are, the more valuable . Cultured pearls, however, are the result of the a piece of mantle tissue from a shell being transplanted into another shell . The only way to differentiate between natural and cultured is via X-ray at a gem testing laboratory - a cultured pearl will show a different structure . Imitation pearls are made of mother-of-pearl, coral or conch shell . £2.19m is one of most expensive pearls to be auctioned by Christie's .","An unsuspecting anonymous woman was given earrings as a gift by husband .

Aubrey Castro, from San Dimas, California, who has been battling Type 2 Leukemia since last May. She hopes that her artistic talents can help benefit the 175,000 kids like her who are diagnosed with childhood cancer every year around the world. 'She already is such an artist. She does the flower in one stroke,' her mother, Vanessa Castro, tells ABC News, adding that her daughter paints three flowers on each card, one for every year of her life. Little angel: Leukemia sufferer, Aubrey Castro, three, (pictured) is creating hand-painted Mother's Day cards to sell for the Baldrick's Foundation, which raises money for childhood cancer research . Aubrey was rushed to hospital last year when doctors discovered a high temperature in her stomach. After running tests, she went into surgery and the very next day, started on a course of chemotherapy. 'Ever since she’s been going through treatment, she’ll paint or color with crayons or makers,' Mrs Castro explains. 'Even when she was at home and on steroids. She had an easel, it was painting and coloring… that’s how the cards evolved.' Aubrey, whose favorite colors are pink . and purple, wants to be an artist when she grows up and she seems well . on her way; her family have already sold over 1,500 cards, and Aubrey . wants to sell 2,014 by Mother's Day. Hard at work: Aubrey paints three flowers on each card, one for every year of her life, and wants to be an artist when she grows up . Colorful: The pretty cards (pictured) have already sold 1,500 copies and Aubrey is aiming to reach 2,014 by Mother's day . Precious: Audrey (pictured before undergoing chemotherapy) says she wants to help the 175,000 kids like her who are diagnosed with childhood cancer every year around the world . Girlie girl: Aubrey's favorite colors are pink and purple and her parents say she loves to paint, write, sing and dance . The card materials have been donated by a local printing company, and the cards are being sold of the St. Baldrick's Foundation's website - a charity which raises money for childhood cancer research - and on a friend's Etsy store for $5 a piece. 'I wanted Aubrey to just know that we've been so blessed in this journey, and that she, as a little three-year-old, can make a huge impact,' her mother says. 'She's the little girl her parents had prayed for, who loves to dance, sing, paint and write,' reads the website set up in her name. 'She loves her big brother, the two of them are best friends always taking care of one another.'

The adorable three-year-old apparently hasn't 'warmed up' to the idea and has said she doesn't want her mother to lose her hair. If their target of 2,014 cards is reached by Mother's Day, the family will raise $10,000 dollars for the Baldrick's Foundation, and if not, Mrs Castro says they will keep selling them anyway.

"By . Tom Latchem . While Anna Windass was torn over her deal to have sex with a crooked business partner to help her family, the actor who plays her, Debbie Rush, says she'd have no similar qualms. 'I have three children and would do anything for them,' insists the married mum, 48. 'When you have kids you'd go to the ends of the earth for them.' Corrie's version of Indecent Proposal - the 1993 hit movie in which Robert Redford paid $1 million for a night with married Demi Moore - is continuing to grip the nation: Anna's been left tormented after secretly sleeping with psychotic builder Pat Phelan. Debbie says that if it meant helping her kids she would say yes to an Indecent Proposal . The villain has left Anna's partner Owen owing the bank Â£80,000 over a dodgy building deal and is also threatening to go to police after being attacked by her son Gary. Sleeping with Anna was his price to stop the harassment. 'It was sold to me as Indecent Proposal, only much less glamorous,' says Debbie. 'But whereas in the movie they do it out of greed, Anna doesn't want money, she just wants her family to be left alone.' And while the Hollywood blockbuster had a happy ending, Corrie viewers can expect a different outcome for Anna and Owen. Debbie's character is living a similar storyline to Demi Moore in Indecent Proposal . 'Anna's desperate to hold the family together by keeping this a secret, but things never stay secret in soapland, and she's racked  by guilt. As the family unravels, the question will be, ""Was it worth it?""' It's a dream storyline for Debbie, who only started acting at the age of 35. She'd always wanted to be a performer but lost confidence after being bullied at school and credits her new career to husband Andrew. The couple met while he worked as a chef in his father's hotel where Debbie was a cleaner. 'We fell madly in love. On our first date he took me to see the musical Oliver!,' she says. 'He made me feel confident enough to perform again - but then parenthood took over.' Debbie admits using thoughts of their three grown-up kids to act this harrowing storyline - and draws on her own life to portray cash-strapped Anna. 'When my children were little I worked in Asda to make ends meet - sometimes 13 days in a row.' Debbie with co-star Ian Puleston-Davies who plays Owen Armstrong . It was the deaths of her dad Neil and stepdad Tom within six months of each other that prompted her to change her life. 'They were only in their 50s. I was nearly 30 and it made me think life was too short not to follow my dream,' says Debbie. After juggling motherhood and amateur dramatics, then drama school - 'I did it in the evenings and it took five years. I still had to work in the day' - Debbie had roles in a Hollyoaks spin-off and the drama Shameless before joining Corrie in 2008. And what of the future? 'On the Street I'm getting good storylines and working with people I adore, so we'll see. But I'm really ambitious. I believe if you focus you can do what you want in life. That's my motto.' BORN 19 March 1966, in Castleton, Derbyshire. HOME Lancashire. HUSBAND Andrew, married 25 years. CHILDREN Tom, 24 (musician), Poppy, 23, and William, 19 (both actors). PAST JOBS On a supermarket cheese counter; as a teaching assistant at a special needs school. TRAINED Manchester School of Acting . TV ROLES Hollyoaks In The City (2006), The Street (2007), Shameless (2008), Salvage (2009).

"By . Katy Winter . She may only be 21 years old, but Cara Delevingne has well and truly conquered the world of modelling. With numerous lucrative and high-profile contracts to her name, she is seldom out of the spotlight - but it seems the model is not as confident as she might appear. Speaking to the Metro, Cara admitted that she hates looking at pictures of herself, and that her foray into acting - with an upcoming role in the new Sky TV drama Timeless - has been difficult. Cara Delevingne is making the move from catwalk queen to actress and will appear in a short film, Timeless, (pictured here with co-star Sylvia Syms), part of the Playhouse Presents season on Sky Arts . The 21-year-old supermodel looks as if she is giving it her all in this scene from Timeless, where she appears opposite veteran actress Sylvia Syms . ‘I couldn’t hear it, see it [Timeless], it was horrible. It’s the same with my modelling photos as well. I’m very critical of myself but then you’ve always got to improve so I think it’s a good thing.’ Despite this self-doubt, Cara is determined to pursue her acting career, confessing that it was actually where her career began. The Briton, who is currently dating American actress Michelle Rodriguez, says she fell into her phenomenal catwalk career as a backup when she suffered rejection in the acting world. ‘I started auditioning for movies before I started modelling but I couldn’t deal with the rejection. When I got turned down for something it would take me weeks to get over it,’ she says. However it seems that taking a less-than-linear path into her acting career has served her well. In Timeless, Cara plays a young woman whose fiance is a soldier serving in Afghanistan and the experience brings her closer to her great-grandmother, played by Syms . Cara certainly seemed to ooze confidence as she was seen out for the evening with Suki Waterhouse  on Wednesday in London . The model has previously only given fans a tiny snapshot of her thespian skills - appearing in a short film for Karl Largerfeld. All reports suggest Cara has successfully made the leap from catwalk to small screen in her television debut, Timeless, a short film which will be shown on the Sky Arts channel. Stills from the show, which is to be . screened later this year as part of the Playhouse Presents season, suggest that far from a token cameo role, Cara has taken on a . meaty, highly emotional part. The blonde seemed to be in high spirits and showing no sign of self-doubt, as she enjoyed a catch-up with talented co-star Sylvia Syms . In Timeless, Cara plays a young woman whose fiance is a soldier serving in Afghanistan and the experience brings her closer to her great-grandmother, played by Syms, who was also separated from her partner due to the pressures of war. Timeless is due to be screened on Sky Arts on June 19.","Cara is set to appear in Sky TV drama Timeless .

"By . Deni Kirkova . A mother-of-two has lost eight stone in weight after pledging to give herself a new body for her 50th birthday. Diane Purdey, from Poole, once wore size 26 clothing and weighed 21st 12lb. But she banished biscuits and unhealthy food from her diet after deciding she did not want her 50th birthday celebrations to be marked by ill health. Diane pictured after losing more than 8st (left) and before her weight loss, when she wore a size 26 (right) She said: 'I reached the point in my life where I'd had enough of being the size that I was. I knew I had a special birthday coming up and I had to do something. 'I wanted to look good in photos and feel proud of myself.' Diane, now 51, lost control of her weight in the years after she gave birth to her sons Russell, 29, and Ian, 27. She said: 'I had only been a stone overweight before I had children. 'Over the years my eating habits just got worse and the weight crept on. I could eat half a large packet of Jaffa cakes or half a full-sized loaf of tiger bread for a snack, and I didn't take any exercise. 'I'd tried to lose weight a few times never got near my goal so had given up.' Diane could eat half a large packet of Jaffa cakes or half a full-sized loaf of tiger bread - as a snack . Her steadily declining health caused doctors to prescribe tablets to ease her high blood pressure and by June 2012 she was suffering with nagging pain in her joints caused by poor diet and inactivity. She decided to join her local branch of Slimming World with her husband Trevor, 53, a mechanical engineer. She said: 'My birthday was four months away and I doubted whether I would be able to make a meaningful difference, but it was very helpful to have Trevor there with me in the early days.' In the first week of her new eating programme, she lost 9lb. By the time her husband surprised her with a dream holiday to Mexico for her 50th birthday, Diane had made significant changes . Diane had already lost four stone by the time she went to Mexico for her surprise 50th birthday celebration . Four months later, by the time her husband surprised her with a dream holiday to Mexico to mark her 50th birthday, Diane had made significant changes to her diet and lifestyle and had already lost an impressive four stone in weight. Before she began her new regime, Diane typically ate sugary cereal for breakfast, followed by chicken mayonnaise sandwiches for lunch with pie and chips for evening meal, with biscuits as snacks throughout the day. Today, she eats Weetabix for breakfast, followed by sushi for lunch and fish with rice for an evening meal. She has replaced sugary snacks with pieces of fruit. Breakfast: Sugary cereal . Lunch: Chicken mayo sandwiches . Dinner: Pie and chips . Snacks: Loaf tiger bread, Jaffa cakes . Breakfast: Weetabix . Lunch: Sushi . Dinner: Fish and rice . Snacks: Fruit . Diane now weighs 13st 9lb and wears size 16 clothes. She is now determined to lose the final pounds to reach her target weight of 13st. In an incredible turnaround, she has also been taken off medication for high blood pressure, having relied on daily tablets for the previous ten years. She now runs five kilometres every Saturday and has started her own mid-week running club. She also cycles and attends dancing classes with her husband, who has lost more than two stone since starting his own weight loss journey. Diane, an accounts administrator, said: 'I'm so happy to have achieved all I have. When I look back at the photos how big I became I'm quite ashamed of how bad I let things get. 'Now, I try to encourage people around me to eat healthier. I want other people to realise what they can do if they put their minds to it.' Diane, now 51, has managed to slim down even more - and, most importantly,  keep the weight off .

"By . Bianca London . We can all recall that scene in 1990 rom-com Pretty Woman where Julia Roberts walks into a luxury boutique dressed in her scruffy clothes and the saleswoman says: 'I don’t think we have anything for you here. You’re obviously in the wrong place.' It now appears the snooty woman behind the till might have hit upon a genius sales tactic - because, according to new research, rude sales assistants can actually make us want to buy more. According to the study, called 'Should the Devil Sell Prada? Retail Rejection Increases Aspiring Consumers' Desire for the Brand', which will be published in the October issue of the Journal of Consumer Research, staff with an obnoxious attitude makes shoppers want to spend more - as long as it's luxury goods on offer. Remember that? Just like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, who returns to the store who snubbed her carrying high-end bags after a shopping spree, rude staff can actually make us want to buy more, reveals a new study . The University of British Columbia sought to understand the relationship between rude treatment and desire to purchase something . Professor Darren Dahl, a marketing expert leading the research, carried out a study whereby volunteers were given a scenario. The participants were told to imagine that they were shopping at either a designer or high street clothes shop. Actors playing sales assistants were told to treat the participants with a welcoming or snooty attitude. Could it work? A professor behind the study said that snobbiness might actually be a qualification worth considering for luxury brands like Louis Vuitton or Gucci . The results revealed that those participants treated with attitude said it made them want to purchase the designer goods more. 'This only worked for brands and stores that customers would aspire to, truly luxury brands like Burberry or Gucci,' said Professor Darren Dahl. He added: 'It appears that snobbiness might actually be a qualification worth considering for luxury brands like Louis Vuitton or Gucci. The staff's snobbishness makes customers feel like they’re back in high school again, where being in with the popular crowd seems all the rage. 'Our research indicates they can end up having a similar effect to an ""in-group"" in high school that others aspire to join. The desire ""to belong""…is a powerful force,' added Professor Dahl.","Study found snobby staff make shoppers want to buy more .

"By . Emma Innes . A quarter of women who have an abortion go on to have another one, new figures show. And 57 per cent of young women who had an abortion claimed to have been using contraception when they conceived. The majority of these women were using short-term methods of contraception, such as the Pill or condoms. A quarter of women who have an abortion go on to have another one, new figures show (file picture) The figures, from reproductive health charity Marie Stopes UK, also revealed that only 12 per cent of women have used emergency contraception and that the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have had more than one abortion. They also showed that a month after having an abortion 86 per cent of women are using contraception, but 67 per cent use their chosen method of contraception for less than a year. Reasons for stopping include menstrual irregularities and not renewing supply in time to take the Pill. After having an abortion, 63 per cent of the women surveyed were given long-acting reversible contraception – compared to 30 per cent of young women in England as a whole – and they were more likely to choose these methods of contraception if they had had more than one abortion or if they had had a surgical abortion. The researchers analysed five years of Marie Stopes UK’s patient data, surveying 430 women - 121 of whom had previously had an abortion – and all of whom were between the ages of 16 and 24. Although the total number of abortions in England and Wales has gradually declined in recent years, the number of women seeking abortion who had one or more previous abortions is increasing. Some 57 per cent of people who have an abortion were using contraception when they conceived - most were using the Pill or condoms . Genevieve Edwards, Director of Policy at Marie Stopes UK, said: ‘Women have three fertile decades to manage, but too many women are being let down by a lack of on-going support in choosing and using the most effective method of contraception. ‘If we tackled the lack of sex and relationship education in schools, invested in contraceptive training for health professionals and bridged the gap between abortion, contraception and sexual health services, we’d see the rates of unwanted pregnancies plummet.’ The researchers say that with typical use, nine in 100 women become pregnant each year while taking the pill and that condoms have a failure rate of 18 per cent. This failure rate means that of the people who say condoms are their chosen method of contraception, 18 per cent will actually not be protected from pregnancy each time they have sex. This can be because they do not actually use a condom, because they do not use it properly, or because it breaks. In contrast, there is a less than one per cent failure rate for long-acting methods of contraception, such as implants and coils. Ms Edwards added: ‘We have got to get better at talking about contraception and abortion. One in three women will have an abortion and one in four of them will go on to have another. ‘Our research shows there is no particular demographic group who are more likely to have abortions – it can happen to any of us. But for the majority of women, it was more often the short-term methods that failed them. ‘Getting this right is also good for the public purse. Fitting a coil costs about £40 and lasts ten years – that’s less than 8p a week and it repays the NHS many times over in abortion or maternity costs.’","The majority of women who conceive while using contraception are taking the Pill or using condoms - very few are using longer-term contraceptives .

"By . Roz Lewis . Kris' first acting role was in Closing Numbers with Jane Asher . When I was boarding at Wells Cathedral School I'd really enjoyed acting, so after I'd flunked my A-levels and spent eight months in Hong Kong, staying with my father who was in the Air Force, I returned to the UK to pursue my dream. By the time I was 19, about six months after I'd finished at Redroofs Stage School in Maidenhead, I went for my first film audition as an actor. I was living in a not very nice part of Maidenhead, renting a room for Â£38 a week and working in a nightclub while applying for work. The day I went up for the audition in London was very exciting. It was for a Channel 4 film called Closing Numbers with Jane Asher. I hadn't done a film audition before so I met the director Stephen Whittaker and read for him. He said he wasn't entirely sure I was suitable for the role but promised to call me later. As I caught the train back from London to Maidenhead that afternoon I picked up a newspaper that had been left on the seat and it randomly fell open on the horoscopes page. The advice for Aries, my star sign, was sage. 'Something you do today will colour not only the next few days but the months and the years ahead,' it read. I thought, 'Well, that sounds good to me.' I tore out the horoscope, put it in my wallet and went home. In the end I did get the job, and spent three days filming in Bushey near Watford. As it was such a small part, I didn't get a car to pick me up and rather embarrassingly I was late on my first day and kept Jane Asher waiting for 45 minutes. Unfortunately, after Closing Numbers I didn't get another role in film or TV for a long time, but I kept that clipping in my wallet and it became my mantra as a reminder not to give up. I slogged away in rep theatre gradually learning my craft - I didn't feel I had any other options - and when I wasn't acting I'd work in factories just to keep the money coming in. Kris (left) in Closing Numbers in 1993, he believe he owes the role to a horoscope . Then, just as my career began to blossom - much to the relief of my parents, who thought acting was just a passing phase - I lost the clipping. But it had served its purpose, inspiring me to keep plugging away when times were tough. My latest role in Death In Paradise is a fantastic job. Spending six months in a beautiful place like Guadeloupe, working with a great cast and dodging hurricanes is a dream come true. I'd never been a fan of astrology and to be honest I don't believe anyone could make predictions for one-twelfth of the population, but on that day those random words in a newspaper really struck a chord with me. I can still quote them, that's how much of an impression they made. I'd like to think it was my persistence and talent that got me where I am... but who knows, maybe it was written in the stars too. Series three of Death In Paradise is out now on DVD and available to buy from www.bbcshop.com.","Kris earned his first acting role in Closing Numbers with Jane Asher .

"By . Emma Innes . A teenager has not eaten a meal for almost five years because she has a rare condition which paralyses her stomach. Ayllah-Beau Foley, 19, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, has been in agony for years since she developed gastroparesis - a rare condition which paralyses the stomach muscles. The teenager is now only able to eat the tiniest amounts of food and is fed through a feeding tube directly to her bloodstream. Ayllah-Beau Foley, 19, has a rare condition which means her stomach is paralysed and unable to process food . Ayllah-Beau said: ‘Having this condition has really changed my life. ‘I can’t sit down for meals with my family anymore, I can’t eat out with my friends - I can’t even tuck into a Sunday lunch. ‘I have a twin brother, Jordan, but we can’t eat cake together on our birthday - if I tried, I’d just be sick. ‘It is really hard but I try and stay positive, and I just hope I can beat this horrible illness one day.’ Ayllah-Beau’s condition first developed when she returned from a volunteering project in India. She said: ‘I was so excited to go to India with school and I couldn’t wait to get out there and get stuck in. Ayllah-Beau vomits if she tries to eat, so she has to be tube-fed to ensure she gets the nutrients she needs . Ayllah-Beau (pictured with her mother, Christine) has tried various treatments but all have failed . She now has to be fed directly into her bloodstream through a tube in her neck. She is pictured with her mother, Christine, and the device that supplies her nutrients . ‘But when I came back I just felt awful and started to get really ill. ‘I assumed it was just food poisoning I’d picked up out there, but it just got worse and worse.’ Gastroparesis is a chronic condition in which the stomach is unable to empty in the normal way. Symptoms including feeling sick and vomiting when eating, bloating, loss of appetite and weight loss. The problem is thought to be caused by a problem with the nerves or muscles controlling the emptying of the stomach. In many cases, the cause of this nerve damage is unknown but it can also be caused by poorly controlled diabetes. Other possible causes include Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and some medications. The condition cannot be cured but it can usually be controlled. Some people are able to manage the condition by changing their diet, for example by eating six small meals a day or by sticking to soft, easily digestible foods. In some cases, symptoms can be improved with medication but other people require injections of Botox into the valve between their stomach and small intestine. If all of these options fail, a patient can have a new procedure which involves fitting a pacemaker device to encourage the stomach to process food. If none of these options succeed in making the stomach process food, the patient will have to be fed through a tube. Source: NHS Choices . It soon became clear that Ayllah-Beau needed medical attention, and her parents took her to the doctors. Her . mother and full-time carer, Christine, 46, said: ‘At first we assumed . that Beau just had Delhi belly - something that she’d picked up when she . was out there, but she wasn’t getting any better. ‘Eventually we took her to the doctors but they seemed stumped too. ‘At first they thought it was something to do with her appendix, but they did an operation and couldn’t find anything. ‘Then they thought it might be gynaecological but again that wasn’t the answer. ‘Medics even began to suggest that Beau’s condition could be psychological. ‘We were quite annoyed that there was a suggestion that this was all in her head, when that quite clearly wasn’t the case.’ After further tests and examinations Ayllah-Beau was finally diagnosed with gastroparesis. Her mother said: ‘We were shocked to hear that her stomach muscles were paralysed - we had no idea that something like that was even possible, but it was a relief to get a diagnosis too. ‘Beau had lost about three stone in weight, so it was great to think that something was finally going to be done and she could get better. ‘But it soon became apparent that this wasn’t the kind of diagnosis we had wanted.’ Ayllah-Beau has tried various treatments since her diagnosis, including a feeding tube directly into her bowel, and a gastric pacemaker, but none have cured her condition. The gastric pacemaker sent electrical pulses to her stomach to try and stimulate the muscles, but it failed to help her. She now relies on a feeding tube that sends nutrients straight into her bloodstream through a drip in a vein. This means the nutrition bypasses her normal digestive system altogether. Ayllah-Beau first fell ill after returning from a trip to India (pictured). She initially thought she had 'Delhi belly' but decided to visit her doctor when her condition continued to deteriorate . Doctors were initially baffled by Ayllah-Beau's illness and even suggested it could be psychological . Her mother said: ‘The tube she has now feeds nutrients into her jugular vein and transports them to her heart and the rest of the bloodstream. ‘She is fed for 14 hours overnight to keep her alive. ‘At the moment that is the best treatment that she can have, and we just have to hope that there is something better around the corner.’ But despite being fed essential nutrients, Ayllah-Beau still wishes she could eat like everybody else. She said: ‘I still get cravings for things like chocolate, sweets and burgers. ‘I might have a teeny tiny bite every now and then, just to satisfy the craving, but it’s not the same. ‘It’s horrible because I used to love different foods so much, and now I can’t have any of them. ‘I’m exhausted all the time, so I have to see what my friends get up to from Facebook. Ayllah-Beau's nutrients are now given to her in a way that completely bypasses her digestive system . Ayllah-Beau's food has to be specially prepared for her and is fed into her bloodstream for 14 hours a day. She is pictured with a fridge full of the solution she is fed . ‘My twin brother, Jordan, is a soldier and sometimes it can be difficult seeing him so active when I’m cooped up in bed all the time - but of course I’m so proud of him. ‘I’ve come to accept my condition now and I take each day as it comes. ‘I hope that one day, I’ll be back to my normal self, but for now I try to stay as positive as I can.’ Dr Simon Gabe, a Consultant . Gastroenterologist at St Mark’s Hospital, in Harrow, who treats . Ayllah-Beau said: ‘Gastroparesis is rare. It is a condition describing . weakness of the muscles of the stomach, meaning that the food in the . stomach does not empty well. ‘This results in a feeling of fullness that continues for longer than normal, nausea and vomiting. Patients will lose weight as a result. ‘It is estimated that it affects one in 50,000 of the population and is more common in women than men. ‘The commonest cause is diabetes, occurring in diabetics who have had poor diabetic control over many years. Ayllah-Beau desperately hopes she will eventually be able to eat normally again . Ayllah-Beau's illness means she is exhausted all the time and she says it is hard not to be able to go out with her friends. Image shows tubes entering her stomach before she started being fed through a vein in her neck . ‘However, there is an increasing group of patients that have gastroparesis as part of a problem affecting the whole of the gut - when the nerves or muscles in the gut do not work in a coordinated way. This causes abdominal pain, vomiting and weight loss. ‘This is a dysmotility of the gut and while there are a number of possible causes, generally we do not know the cause and this is called Chronic Idiopathic Intestinal Pseudoobstruction (CIIP). ‘This is a young group of patients and the symptoms of gastroparesis are often missed. Poor appetite, vomiting and weight loss in young women may be considered to be an eating disorder, but for some of these patients gastroparesis may play a part.’ Ayllah-Beau is raising money for St Mark's Hospital.

"By . Emma Innes . Doctor David Richmond says the trend of starting a family later is irreversible. News reader Kate Silverton (pictured) is pregnant at 43 with her second child - she had her first baby two years ago . Over the last few decades the age at which women are deciding to start a family has risen steadily. From news reader Kate Silverton – who is pregnant with what she describes as a 'miracle baby' at 43 – to Shameless actress Tina Malone – who had a baby at 50 - women across the country are having children later. And now, a leading doctor has said this is a trend that is here to stay. Dr David Richmond, Britain’s top maternity doctor, says the rise in the number of older mothers is irreversible. He added that it is not worth trying to persuade women to have children sooner, The Guardian reports. Dr Richmond, president of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists, told the paper: ‘I think [the trend] is irreversible because of increasing equality in the social, professional, financial [and] corporate environment we live in. 'If you put a man in that situation, they would do exactly the same. I completely respect that position. ‘Older women becoming mothers is a trend that’s here to stay, I believe.’ Dr Richmond believes this is because women want to feel financially secure and secure in their jobs before taking maternity leave. However, he also believes that most know the risks of delaying motherhood and that warning of the dangers them will not reverse the trend. He explained that he believes the trend has occurred because society has changed and that that is not something doctors can change. And as for the additional cost to the health service – Dr Richmond says treating mothers over the age of 40 will be expensive but that these women continue to represent a minority meaning the cost will not be unmanageable. Dr Richmond says that even warning women of the risks of delaying motherhood will not reverse the trend. Shameless star Tina Malone (pictured as Mimi in the show) had a baby when she was 50 . The average age at which a woman in Britain has her first baby has been rising steadily and now stands at 29.8. Some 49 per cent of live births in the UK each year are now to mothers over the age of 30. Figures from the Office for National Statistics also show that the number of babies born to women over the age of 40, and even over the age of 50, is increasing rapidly. In 2008 69 babies were born to women over the age of 50, by 2012 this figure had risen to 154. This concerns many doctors as having a baby later in life can increase a woman’s chance of miscarriage and of a complicated labour. The number of women aged 50 and over who gave birth in 2012 hit 154, up from 69 in 2008 . Women who delay motherhood are also more likely to have fertility problems and their children are more likely to be born with disabilities and birth defects. Kate Silverton describes her babies as 'miracles' - she conceived her first child, Clemency, naturally after years of failed IVF treatment and then had two miscarriages before becoming pregnant with the baby she is due to give birth to within weeks. Dr Richmond is relaxed about the trend of older motherhood but his views are in sharp contrast with the views of the government’s chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, who has expressed acute concern about the situation. Professor Dame Sally says it is a 'worrying issue' which could lead to increased medical risks.","Dr David Richmond says it's not worth trying to persuade women to have children sooner, as society has changed and doctors cannot control that .

"By . Emma Innes . A dental receptionist and her boss brought a patient 'back from the dead' after he had a heart attack in the waiting room. Charlotte Anderson-Hughes, 23, and dentist Chandra Metha used a defibrillator on Simon Walker, 53, from Hyde, after he collapsed in Maggie Jackson’s Independent Dental Hygiene Service, in Tameside, Greater Manchester. After realising an ambulance was not going to arrive in time to save him, they began CPR and used a defibrillator to shock his heart. Simon Walker, 53, had a heart attack and collapsed in a dentist's waiting room on Monday . Ms Anderson-Hughes said: ‘He collapsed on the floor. Chandra shouted for me and put him in the recovery position but it wasn't working - it was all so fast. ‘I was looking at him and he was clinically dead. He was going blue and his eyes were open. It was awful. ‘We got the defibrillator and used it twice. It was only then that we got a pulse. You just say to yourself, “keep going, keep going or he's going to die”. ‘We do the first aid training but never think you'll have to use it.’ Mr Walker was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital by paramedics after falling ill on Monday and is on his way to recovery. He sent a text to staff at the practice saying he was 'eternally grateful' for the help. Mr Walker was saved by the receptionist, Charlotte Anderson-Hughes (pictured) and dentist Chandra Metha. They performed CPR and used a defibrillator to restart his heart . Mr Walker (pictured with his daughter, Charlotte Walker, in hospital) says he is eternally grateful to the people who saved his life and that he is planning to raise money for more defibrillators to be placed around his town . Speaking from his hospital bed, he said: ‘I owe Charlotte and Chandra big time. ‘How I can pay them back for what they did is impossible to say. I want to do something for them but I don't know what yet - I'll probably raise some money for more defibrillators around the town. ‘My family were at my bedside yesterday and today they are just over the moon that I'm still here. I only walked to the dentist because I thought the exercise wouldn't do me any harm.’ Maggie Jackson, who runs the practice, is friends with Mr Walker and said her staff were ‘incredible’. She said: ‘He's a friend of mine - so to have my staff save him was amazing. ‘He was dead. He was clinically dead. Chandra did 15 minutes of chest compressions before they used the defibrillator - he's very fit. Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Walker said: 'I owe Charlotte and Chandra big time. How I can pay them back for what they did is impossible to say' ‘Thank God he was there. I'm so relieved my staff did what they did. I'm so proud. They were incredible.’ General Dental Council guidelines say all dentists should have a defibrillator on site, but it is not a legal requirement. Ms Jackson said: ‘Saving somebody's life is priceless. Defibrillators are expensive equipment at around £1,000, but what's that for a life? ‘It's without a doubt the best £1,000 I've ever spent. He was dead yesterday and alive today. ‘If he'd collapsed 100 yards away that would've been it for him.’","Simon Walker, 53, had a heart attack at the dental surgery on Monday .

"By . Dr Rob Hicks . Holidays are a much longed-for time to relax and you don’t want them ruined by a health complaint. Yet few of us have room to pack a first-aid kit. Here, Dr Rob Hicks, a London GP, offers his DIY tips for dealing with everyday medical problems. HONEY OR SUGAR FOR MINOR WOUNDS . For centuries honey has been used to treat skin wounds and burns . Small grazes or cuts can become infected, especially in hot climates where bacteria can flourish. For centuries honey has been used to treat skin wounds and burns and is now used in hospitals around the globe to deal with skin infections. Honey helps kill the bacteria that may cause infection. When honey comes into contact with damaged skin, it triggers the production of antibacterial hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, the sugars in honey mean there is little space for water molecules (bacteria need water to survive, so reducing the amount available makes it hard for them to thrive). Dabbing on honey or a sprinkling of sugar can deprive the bacteria of water, which ultimately destroys them. After washing hands thoroughly, clean the wound, dab a little honey on it and cover with a clean dressing. Any honey will do — you don’t need to use the expensive kind. Alternatively, sprinkle on sugar. To prevent spillage, smear a thin coating of petroleum jelly around the wound first. These ‘sweet’ treatments can be reapplied a couple of times a day. If the injured area becomes red, hot, painful, or discharges pus, or if fever occurs, seek medical advice straight away as this may indicate an infection. TEABAGS FOR  INSECT BITES . A bite from a gnat, midge, mosquito or even an ant will normally cause a red lump with a hole in the middle — this then turns itchy as the bite can provoke a mild allergy-like reaction. As a result chemicals called histamines are released into the surrounding skin, which is what gives us the maddening urge to itch. While bites themselves are rarely a problem, this itch can be, as scratching can break the skin and introduce infection that, in turn, leads to potential problems such as scarring. There are endless possible treatments, but two of my favourites are teabags and oatmeal. Steep a few teabags in boiling water for ten minutes, allow to cool and then apply the liquid to the sting site using a cloth. This helps to relieve inflammation as tannins in the tea are astringent, so reduce the swelling. Alternatively, mix uncooked oatmeal and water into a paste and apply to the itchy area directly, or put the paste into a muslin cloth and hold to the skin. Oatmeal can help reduce inflammation and has a calming, cooling effect on the bite. Steep a few teabags, left, in boiling water for ten minutes, allow to cool and apply liquid to the insect bite using a cloth. It will help to relive inflammation of the sting . BICARBONATE OF SODA FOR CYSTITIS . Variously called sodium bicarbonate, baking soda, or simply ‘bicarb’, it’s good to have a small tub of this in your travel bag. On holiday, exposure to chemicals such as the chlorine in the swimming pool can irritate the area where urine leaves the body (the urethra) and can trigger cystitis in women. Essentially, this is inflammation of the bladder and can lead to a burning sensation when you pass urine. There are other factors that can make it a common holiday ailment: heat and alcohol can dehydrate the body, making the bladder more prone to inflammation; ‘holding on’ when it’s inconvenient to go to the toilet, or facilities are unavailable, can also contribute. Bicarb is alkaline, so drinking half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda stirred into a glass of water several times a day helps as it makes urine less acidic and less likely to cause stinging. It won’t reduce the inflammation in the bladder but it will reduce the pain while the inflammation goes down. If symptoms don’t improve after a couple of days, or if you have a fever, blood in the urine or loin pain, seek medical advice straight away. CUCUMBER FOR SUNBURN . Sunburn can occur in as little as 20 minutes. But you may not even know you have been burnt until five hours later when the damage done will come out as red inflamed patches of skin. Cucumber, a well-known soothing remedy for tired and sore eyes, can also help bring relief to sore, sunburned skin. This is because it contains vitamin C and caffeic acid (an antioxidant also found in coffee) which both have anti-inflammatory effects that help reduce the irritation of sunburn. Cucumber, a well-known soothing remedy for tired and sore eyes, can also help bring relief to sore, sunburned skin because it contains vitamin C and caffeic acid (an antioxidant also found in coffee) which both have anti-inflammatory effects . While many foods contains vitamin C, it’s the combination of these compounds that works best — together with the cooling effects of the cucumber, especially if it’s been in the fridge. For small areas of skin, slices of cool cucumber can be put straight on. If larger areas are affected, it may be more practical to grind cucumber into a paste using a blender or fork, then apply. To make it less messy, you can hold it in place with a sterile dressing and keep it there for as long as is needed. BANANAS FOR HANGOVER . Drinking won’t just dehydrate you (because alcohol is a diuretic), many people also feel light-headed and woozy the morning after. This is because normally the liver releases glucose into the bloodstream. But when the liver is busy processing alcohol, this doesn’t happen, which can lead to low blood sugar levels. While drinking plenty of water can rehydrate you, a banana helps raise depleted sugar levels — the reason being that it has a low glycaemic index. This means the sugar it contains is released slowly. While a biscuit, for example, would raise blood sugar, it would do it quickly, so the body would release a flood of insulin to quickly reduce blood sugar levels. This sudden fall in blood sugar would leave you feeling just as bad as you had before. The banana would give a more sustained recovery. A banana is also gentle on the stomach, which may be irritated by the alcohol. CAMOMILE TEA FOR SORE EYES . Tea, especially camomile, is a particularly good choice for swollen and irritated eyes, whether caused by lack of sleep, allergies or simply sand. Camomile contains anti-irritant compounds such as terpenoids, and flavonoids, a form of antioxidant that soothes inflammation. Brew a cup of camomile tea. Remove the teabag and allow it to cool then place against closed eyes. GINGER FOR TRAVEL SICKNESS . Travel sickness is caused by conflicting information received by the brain from the ears about balance and from the eyes about what you see. This jumble of information triggers feelings of nausea and tummy upset when travelling in cars, boats and planes. Ginger is used to relieve morning sickness in pregnancy and to help overcome the nausea associated with chemotherapy. Some scientific studies suggest that it can also help with motion sickness. It’s believed that compounds called gingerols and shogaols — which give ginger its spiciness — are what provide the benefits, possibly by blocking chemical messages in the brain, so helping to relax muscles in the stomach and gut. How you take it is up to you, but popular ways include ginger tea, ginger biscuits and dried ginger .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Dengue fever affects more than 390 million people around the world each year and its symptoms can be fatal. There is no vaccine for the disease, buy researchers believe they have come up with an alternative to curbing the spread of the disease - in the form of genetically modified mosquitoes. And now Brazil has become the latest country to approve the use of these bugs, which have been engineered in such a way that means their offspring die before reaching maturity. Brazil is the latest country to approve the use of genetically modified mosquitoes, stock image pictured, to curb the spread of dengue fever. Males have been engineered in such a way that means their offspring die before reaching maturity. If the males breed with enough females, the populations will, in theory, be wiped out . The GM mosquito was created by Oxford-based firm Oxitec. The Oxitec insect can be used to control the dengue mosquito, Aedes aegypti and is a strain of the wild species that contains two additional genes. The Oxitec males, which cannot bite, are released to seek out and mate with the wild females. Their offspring inherit the additional genes and die before becoming functional adults. They also inherit a marker that is visible under a special light, making monitoring in the field simple and helping ensure that dengue mosquito control programmes succeed. In several trials, successive releases of the Oxitec males have been shown to reduce substantially the wild population of dengue mosquitoes in the treated area. The idea is that the . male insects are on a suicide mission which involves mating with wild . females before they, and their offspring, die. This, . in theory, can reduce the number of wild mosquitoes which carry and . spread dengue fever. The viral infection causes serious symptoms ranging from high . temperatures and muscle pain to bleeding. Earlier this year, Panama announced plans to release the GM insects into its jungles to similarly help tackle the spread. The bugs were engineered by Oxford-based firm Oxitec. Oxitec has developed the technology to create the genetically modified insects which, it claims, can also be used instead of chemicals to protect food crops from pests.

They have been approved by the Ministry . of Health but critics claim no information about the possible downsides . have been provided to members of the public. There is currently no vaccine for dengue fever so authorities advise the best way to prevent catching the infection is to take precautions when travelling in high-risk areas, such as wearing protective clothing or using a mosquito repellent, stock image pictured, throughout the day and night . Oxitec conducted its first experiments of GM mosquitoes in the Cayman Islands in 2009 and 2010, followed by a smaller experiment in Malaysia in 2010 and 11. In several trials, successive releases of the Oxitec males have been shown to reduce substantially the wild population of dengue mosquitoes in the treated area . Oxitec conducted its first open release experiments of GM mosquitoes in the Cayman Islands in 2009 and 2010, followed by a smaller experiment in Malaysia in 2010 and 11. Both countries have halted further releases. Larger-scale experiments began in Brazil in February 2011. Director of GeneWatch UK, Dr Helen Wallace, said: ‘Local people should be aware that releasing large numbers of GM mosquitoes can pose risks to their health and the environment. 'They also need to know who will be liable if anything goes wrong. Will Oxitec take responsibility for any problems, or just walk away?’ GeneWatch said changes could be introduced into the wild population which means the dengue fever they spread becomes more dangerous to humans. It claims that if the numbers of one type of mosquito - Aedes aegypti – is reduced as result of the release of GM versions, others, such as the Asian Tiger mosquito, which also carry the virus, could come in and thrive.","The insects were genetically modified in a lab in Oxford .

"By . Ben Spencer . From laptops to tablet computers, we have no shortage of gadgets to help us keep track of our lives. If you really want to remember something, however, it may be best to just pick up an old-fashioned pen and some paper. A study has found that when it comes to recalling things we have been told, writing notes by hand is more effective than typing. Old faithful: The Princeton University study found that taking notes by hand aided memory more than high-tech solutions . U.S. psychologists carried out tests of how well students retained information after a lecture. They found those who wrote their notes in longhand had better understood the concepts they had been taught. Pam Mueller, who led the study at Princeton University, said students who had used a pen could recall more information later – whether or not they were given a chance to re-read their notes. She added: ‘Our findings suggest that even when laptops are used as intended – and not for buying things on Amazon during class – they may still be harming academic performance.’ First, 65 students watched recorded lectures armed either with a pen or a laptop. Half an hour later, they were given a series of factual-recall and comprehension questions based on the talk they had heard. The study, published in the journal Psychological Science, found computer users performed significantly worse on the conceptual questions. Those who had used a laptop had taken nearly twice as many notes. Crucially, however, they were far more prone to ‘mindlessly’ transcribing the lecture.","Study finds that writing notes by hand is best way to remember details .

"By . Laura Topham . Turn up at the doctor’s with a sore throat and you’ll probably be told it’s just a viral infection so antibiotics won’t help, and the best thing is to go home and rest. I know, because I’ve suffered with a sore throat for as long as I can remember — every day. But it was only last year that the real, and potentially  serious, cause was diagnosed. It has nothing to do with viral infections, yet millions who suffer from pain or a ‘lump’ in their throat still believe them to be signs of cold or flu and don’t seek medical help. Laura Topham, pictured here, suffers from GORD, which leaves her with a constantly sore throat that she has had 'since she can remember' In fact, like me, they could have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD), which causes stomach acid to spill up into the oesophagus or gullet. This has been quietly damaging my throat, as the acid — as strong and corrosive as battery acid — inflames, attacks and erodes the gullet’s lining. Long term, the risk is that the acid changes the cells lining the gullet, and this in turn can lead to cancer. The root cause of GORD is usually a weakness of the valve between the  stomach and gullet, though some people are simply sensitive to reflux. It can run in families but can also affect anybody, as my diagnosis shows: I am a slim, non-smoking, non-drinking, healthy-eating, thirtysomething female. So common is the condition — better known as acid reflux — that one in five Britons suffer from it at least once a week, and one in 10 daily. Many people have what is called silent reflux — meaning they have none of the typical symptoms of heartburn. Instead they may have other symptoms connected to the acid reflux. ‘Around one in 10 have a sore throat. For others the first sign is rotting teeth as the acid is eroding them, or asthma. About 10 per cent of adult asthma is due to reflux, as people inhale little bits of acid, irritating the airways,’ says Shaw Somers, a consultant specialist upper-gastrointestinal surgeon at Spire Bushy and Queen Alexandra NHS Hospital, Portsmouth . Consequently, doctors often miss the signs. Dr Devinder Bansi, a consultant gastroenterologist at the Bupa Cromwell Hospital, says his colleagues in the ear, nose and throat unit often call him in to see ‘respiratory’ patients who actually have acid reflux. Other common symptoms include heartburn, burping, a bitter taste and regurgitation. Many people have what is called silent reflux ¿ meaning they have none of the typical symptoms of heartburn. The root cause of GORD is usually a weakness of the valve between the  stomach and gullet, though some people are simply sensitive to reflux.So common is the condition ¿ better known as acid reflux ¿ that one in five Britons suffer from it at least once a week, and one in 10 daily . Like many people, I had none of these except a sore throat. I first sought treatment in 2009, following a tonsillectomy that solved my recurrent tonsillitis but not my chronic throat pain. When it was most sore — a sharp, constant pain, and red, raw appearance lasting several days — I returned to my doctor, who diagnosed pharyngitis (an infection of the throat) and prescribed antibiotics. This happened many times over the next few years, although I generally ignored the low-level discomfort and self-medicated with lozenges, ice lollies and vitamins. I noticed my throat was most sore when I was tired, hungover or had been up late, so decided it was due to being run-down or alcohol lowering my immune system. So I stopped drinking, curtailed my late nights, and my throat improved, though after an occasional wedding or hen party I’d always end up with what my doctor diagnosed as an infection. The correct diagnosis came by accident last year. I happened to see a locum, who asked if I had a sore throat, as I had a vitamin D deficiency. When I said that I always had a sore throat, she insisted I see a throat specialist and referred me. I arrived at the hospital two months later, unable to imagine anyone resolving my sore throat given that I’d already had a tonsillectomy and been on and off antibiotics for years. The doctor put a camera up my nose and down my throat, then diagnosed GORD; the pain and visible inflammation in my throat was due to acid damage. I was stunned and protested I’d never had heartburn or indigestion in my life, visualising TV adverts for antacid tablets easing a portly man’s chest-pain after dinner. But the doctor explained you don’t necessarily feel heartburn — in fact a sore throat or ‘lump in the throat’ is a common symptom. People may also cough or clear their throat constantly, as phlegm is produced to try and counteract the damage. I was still unpersuaded, so the doctor handed me a list of the main lifestyle culprits. It was basically a list of my favourite treats: tea (I have eight cups a day); dairy (I drink two pints of milk daily); chocolate (at least one bar a day); and eating or drinking late at night. ‘To deal with fat in foods like chocolate and dairy, the body delays stomach emptying in order to emulsify the fat in warm acid,’ says Mr  Somers. ‘That means acid doesn’t clear out the bottom and starts sloshing up the top end.’ Could Laura's love of dairy, chocolate, tea (left) and wine (right) have contributed to her painful throat condition? Tea, coffee, peppermint and caffeine trigger reflux as they relax the valve, while alcohol and smoking trigger acid release in the stomach lining, meaning you secrete more acid. Acidic foods like fruit juice exacerbate the issue. Once I’d accepted the diagnosis, I was ecstatic. Suddenly things clicked into place, like why my throat was worse after nights out. Not only is alcohol very acid-producing but I always ate tea and toast before bed to ward off hangovers, so was digesting food horizontally, when gravity is not helping acid remain in the stomach. To prevent acid reflux you should not eat or drink within three hours of bedtime. I wasn’t run-down or fighting off an infection after all; I’d simply irritated my throat by my behaviour. It was a revelation to recognise other symptoms too, such as the ‘lump’ in my throat — swelling from the inflammation — and my persistent earache, which had developed in the last year. I was told that nerves that run from the gullet to the brain have an obscure connection to the ear canal. I also speak so quietly that  people struggle to hear me. ‘Acid reflux can cause a hoarse voice as it inflames the vocal cords,’ explains Mr Somers. My doctor prescribed omeprazole tablets, twice daily for six months, which she claimed would cure my reflux. Omeprazole is a form of  proton pump inhibitor (PPI), a prescription drug that reduces acid production in the stomach; over-the-counter remedies such as Gaviscon and Rennies neutralise the acid coming up. My first spell on the pills lasted three weeks, until I became convinced they were making me gain weight. I started the tablets again last autumn when the pain worsened. But at night the room spun so severely I had to sit up all night — vertigo is a side-effect for around one  per cent of the drug’s users, so I stopped taking it. However, I recently restarted the tablets, in the morning, resolving the vertigo, as I discovered how serious acid reflux can be. The first my friend heard of his own acid reflux was when he was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. He has survived, but has lost much of his stomach and still has major surgery. Of course, not everyone who has acid reflux gets cancer. But 10 to 15 cent of people with GORD develop a pre-cancerous change in their oesophageal lining, a condition called Barrett’s oesophagus. And one in every 200 patients with Barrett’s oesophagus will develop cancer. Though the numbers are small, the longer you have acid reflux, the greater the danger, and I could have it for decades. ‘Over time the condition can cause scarring of the gullet, which leads to a narrowing so you can’t swallow. Occasionally it leads to the lining becoming cancerous, so we’re very active in treating young people,’ says Mr Somers. ‘Proton pump inhibitors work for 90 per cent of people and take the sting away, but acid is still going up into the gullet and injuring it; surgery will reduce the risk of cancer much more.’ A private consultant has told me that, to find my best treatment options, I need a gastroscopy — where a camera will be inserted into my oesophagus to investigate the state of my stomach valve. If it isn’t working, I may require surgery — either traditional internal ‘origami’ to fold the stomach around the weak valve to stop acid splashing up, or the new Linx bracelet, where a ring of tiny magnets is placed around the bottom of the gullet, allowing food through but stopping acid rising up. In the meantime, as well as omeprazole, I take antacids when the pain intensifies. I also intend to change my diet as I’ve heard it can make a radical difference - but I’m a tea and chocolate addict. If I wasn’t, I might never have felt the reflux in the first place.","Laura Topham, from London, has Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD)

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple has launched a new version of its hugely popular Macbook Air laptop amid rumours production of the much anticipated iWatch has begun. The firm quietly added an upgraded version of its laptop to its website today, increasing the speed of the machine and dropping its price by $100. The laptops now start at $899, and have the latest Intel Haswell processors. Scroll down for video . Apple CEO Steve Jobs holds Apple's Macbook Air notebook computer at its launch in 2008. Today the firm revealed a new, upgraded and cheaper version . Two new versions are available, a 13-inch MacBook Air with up to 12 hours of battery life and an 11-inch MacBook Air with up to 9 hours of battery life. The 11-inch MacBook Air comes with a 1.4 GHz processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 2.7 GHz, 4GB of memory and is available with 128GB of flash storage starting at $899, and 256GB of flash storage starting at $1,099. The 13-inch MacBook Air comes with a 1.4 GHz processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 2.7 GHz, 4GB of memory and is available with 128GB of flash storage starting at $999, and 256GB of flash storage starting at $1,199. The new machines are the cheapest portable Macs Apple has ever sold., and the firm hopes it will eat into sales on Windows laptops. 'With MacBook Air starting at $899, there’s no reason to settle for anything less than a Mac,' said Apple's Philip Schiller. 'Macs have never been more popular, and today we’ve boosted the performance and lowered the price of MacBook Air so even more people can experience the perfect everyday notebook.' The low key launch comes amid claims Apple has begun manufacturing its much anticipated iWatch in China. According to China Daily, the wearable is said to take advantage of a manufacturing process called System-in-Package which puts all of the watch's circuitry on a single chip. It believes the watch could go on sale later this year, makling an unveiling at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), held in San Francisco from June 2nd, likely. Apple fan and artist Martin Hajek created these incredible lifelike mockups of an iWatch, whcih he believes could come in two version, with the top of the range being the iWatch S, which has a metal body and leather strap . Martin Hajek also believes Apple will release a lower cost plastic version of the watch, which will come in several different colours . Speculation around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013. Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Other . rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let . users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. Apple has refused to hint at what announcement will be made. 'We have the most amazing developer community in the world and have a great week planned for them,' said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. 'Every year the WWDC audience becomes more diverse, with developers from almost every discipline you can imagine and coming from every corner of the globe. 'We look forward to sharing with them our latest advances in iOS and OS X so they can create the next generation of great apps.' The conference, aimed at app developers, WWDC will feature more than 100 technical sessions, and over 1,000 Apple engineers will attend to offer help. In previous years, the company has unveiled major new versions of its iOS and OS X software for Macs at the event, as well as new iPhones - although the firm is not expected to unveil these until September this year. However, Apple fans have not waited for the announcement, and many have released stunning new images of what they believes Apple's iWatch could look like. The latest images reveal two models, a luxury iWatch S with a metal case and leather strap, and a plastic iWatch C. The incredibly realistic images were mocked up by artist and Apple fan Martin Hajek, and even show how the timepiece would look in Apple''s retail stores. The incredibly detailed mockups even reveal how the watch could be displayed in Apple's stores . The mockups are Hajek's second attempt at an iWatch, having worked with Mac User magazine for the first. 'Right after Apple launched the colorful iPhone 5C I figured it would be nice to have a look at adding color to my original iWatch concept,' he said. 'I added some color, simplified the design and basically turned it into an iPhone 5C for around your wrist.' The latest rumours around the secret smartwatch claim Apple has hired a raft of medical and sleep experts to work on its iWatch project, it has been claimed. It is believed the watch will be able to monitor both exercise and sleep, letting wearers track and analyse their every movement. Although the firm has refused to confirm it is even working on a watch, experts believe it could be released this year. The iWatch c would match Apple's iPhone 5c perfectly . 9to5Mac reported that Roy J.E.M. Raymann -- whose background includes working on wearables, sensors and non-pharmacological methods of improving sleep quality -- has joined Apple from Philips Research. the firm is also believed to be developing a special app called HealthBook that will be built into the next version of its iOS software, allowing users to track and analyse the data their gadget collect. The firm's iPhone 5S already has a movement tracking chip, called the M5, which is expected to be used in the iWatch. Reports in the New York Times claim the first-generation smartwatch will be charged wirelessly, using existing technologies currently used with select smartphones and cases. Yet future models of the wrist-worn technology may even be powered by solar or kinetic energy to make sure they never lose charge. Solar panels could be fitted underneath the display of the iWatch, for example, and harness the sun's energy. The watch imagined by Hajek has a square screen, while it believed the rear could have sensors to monitor a wearer's health. Hajek even revealed some advertising concepts he thought Apple could use for the iWatch . Casio, . for example, already uses solar technology in its G-Shock range of . watches that can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to . recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch. This is further supported by the fact that in September, Apple posted a job vacancy looking for someone with solar expertise. Other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen and run the next-generation of Apple software, likely to be called iOS 8. Another image showing how the iWatch could look in Apple stores . All these current claims back up the plans laid out in an Apple patent filed in 2011. The patent described a 'wearable accessory device' with a 'flexible display' that could use the same technology as a child's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user's wrist. It also detailed a method in which the battery life could be extended, including a 'solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory device', or 'a kinetic power source similar to those found on some wristwatches.' 'An accessory device designed to be worn . on a leg or arm could greatly benefit from this sort of power . generation, and could lengthen the amount of time between charging,' the . application continued. Similarly, a patent filed in 2009 . detailed how Apple wanted to harness kinetic energy from the movement of . an arm or leg as the wearer was walking. The . curved screen and design rumours were bolstered by a further patent, awarded . last year, which gave Apple the option to install a flexible battery . into future products. Last week, reports claimed Samsung was also looking at adding a curved screen to its own next-generation smartwatch, dubbed Galaxy Gear 2. The original watch launched in September last year and was heavily criticised for its chunky design and poor battery life. Elsewhere, other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen, similar to the concept images pictured, and run the next-generation of Apple software, likely to be called iOS 8 . Some analysts claimed the device was . rushed out to make sure it was one of the first on the market, beating . Apple and Google to their respective rumoured devices. Whereas . Apple may have delayed its own smartwatch release to learn as much . about what customers liked, and didn't like, in the Samsung version. Since . the first Apple iWatch rumours emerged in 2012, a number of . artists have created concept images of what it may look like. Apple is rumoured to be working on an alternative way to charge its much-rumoured iWatch, concept pictured, to remove the need for wires and chargers. Reports claim the first model will be charged wirelessly, while future models may be powered by solar or kinetic energy . Many resembled the square and clunky design of Samsung’s Galaxy . Gear, yet the latest images from Californian designer Todd Hamilton imagine a much more sleek and elegant curved device. Hamilton . took inspiration from fitness bands, as well as the look and . functionality of Apple’s iOS7, to create a watch that is ‘like something . Apple would actually produce.' The concept watch is shown as a simple band, fitted round the wrist like the Nike Fuelband, with a curved touchscreen. Previous iWatch concept images, including this one from MacUser magazine, featured a square screen, and a clunky design, that more closely resembled Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatch .","New MacBook Airs have boosted processors .

Megan Huntsman, accused of killing six of her babies and storing their bodies in her garage, appears in court Monday, April 28, 2014, in Provo, Utah . Authorities also reported finding bloody leather gloves and women's underwear in the garage, and infant booties and clothes in the master bedroom. Police took stained sections of a mattress in the master bedroom as evidence. Police have said Darren West, the estranged husband of Huntsman, 39, found the first body after opening a small white box covered with electrician's tape on April 12. The documents released Friday state that West also told police he discovered the baby in a plastic bag with a strong chemical odor emanating from it. West said there was no decomposition smell, just a chemical odor. Police in Pleasant Grove discovered the six other dead babies after obtaining a search warrant for the house. They were in boxes throughout the garage, wrapped in shirts or towels, documents show. Scene: Seven infant bodies were discovered packaged up in separate containers at this home in Pleasant Grove, Utah.

Huntsman later acknowledged that from 1996 to 2006, she strangled or suffocated six of the babies, put them in plastic bags and packed them inside boxes in the garage south of Salt Lake City, separate court document states. Huntsman said one infant found in the garage was stillborn. Huntsman has been charged with six counts of first-degree murder. She has not entered a plea. Investigators say they know Huntsman's motive but declined to discuss it publicly. During a brief court appearance Monday in Provo, the shackled Huntsman mostly kept her eyes focused downward as she was informed of the charges. Defense attorney Doug Thompson told reporters afterward that he has spoken with Huntsman and she seemed fine, though he declined to provide details on her state of mind.

He said: She's a good lass. She came across as a good laugh, and there was quite a good turnout for this time of year. 'She's off out tonight with us on a bar crawl. I don't think she is a big drinker though - she told me she prefers tea and biscuits.' Mr Collinson said the £500 bottle of champagne that Dee was drinking had been given to her for free.

"By . Steve Nolan . They may look like humble garden sheds from the outside. But they are in fact the latest innovation in affordable housing. Complete with their own kitchen, bathroom and living space, these tiny homes on wheels could be the solution for any young buyer struggling to get on the property ladder. Created by Mark Brown, the designs have started a miniature home movement that is becoming popular in the US and Britain. Home sweet home: Tiny homes on wheels could be the solution to getting on the property ladder at an affordable price . All the mod cons: The tiny homes can come complete with a fully functioning kitchen, shower and toilet . Prices start from £10,000 ($15,400) for a basic shell and a fully fitted home costs up to £18,000 ($27,800). The homes are built in Mark's UK-based Tiny House workshop and towed to the desired location of their buyer on special built in wheels. Despite their cramped appearance, the homes can sleep up to six people and are fitted with a fully functioning kitchen, shower and toilet. The homes are also energy efficient - they arrive fully insulated. Environmentally friendly: The small homes are good for conserving energy - they come fully insulated . Comfortable: Complete with sofa space the tiny homes can sleep up to six people despite their snug appearance . Mark, a builder for more than 15 years, came up with the idea after the credit crunch meant building work became a lot harder to find. Mark said: 'I think they are a fantastic idea because people can live cheaply with very low outgoings. If they ever decide to move they can simply take their home with them and with a bit of TLC, I don’t see any reason they couldn’t last a lifetime. Spacious: The homes feature a double bed sized sleeping space on a mezzanine floor away from the main living area . 'The majority of interest in our Tiny Houses comes from the younger generation who are desperate to get on the property ladder in some way. 'Tiny Houses are not only compact but are very cheap to run which helps the owner save money towards a deposit on a proper ‘bricks and mortar’ house. 'Some people laugh and point when they see one being towed down the high street but when they see the inside, the phrase ""wow"" and ""oh my God"" is used a lot.'","Builder Mark Brown started making the homes when work became scarce .

Minnesota high school to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the . Columbine massacre, authorities claim. John . David LaDue’s plan to use pressure cooker bombs, Molotov cocktails and . multiple firearms including an assault rifle to kill his parents, set . fire to a field and go on a killing spree through Waseca High School was . foiled Tuesday by an alert citizen, police said, and those who know him are shocked. The woman who called 911 says she thought he was acting suspiciously, 'trying not to be seen' and even appeared to be breaking into the storage locker where police began to piece together his horrifying intentions. Court documents show that officers found seven firearms, 400 rounds of ammunition and three homemade bombs in the teen's bedroom, and three more completed bombs, ball bearings and chemicals in the storage facility where he was arrested. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Armed to the teeth: John LaDue had seven guns, six bombs and chemicals to expand his deadly cache - authorities believe he planned to carry out the attack within only a few weeks . Caught: John David LaDue was arrested this week and charged with four counts of premeditated murder before he could carry out his horrifying plan to bomb and shoot his way through Waseca High School . LaDue’s . plan first unraveled when a person near the self-storage unit where . he made his bombs called police to report a suspiciously acting teen, a . police official said during that news conference. Chelsie Schellahas, who lives near the storage facility, told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune the teen was cutting through her backyard when she first noticed him. 'He walked through the puddles when there was a perfectly good road he could have walked on,' Schellhas told the paper. 'It just didn’t seem right to me because we see people come and go with their trucks, and they don’t come on foot and cut through people’s back yards.' 'It was like he was blatantly trying not to be seen,' she continued. 'That’s why I thought it was odd.' LaDue took 'some time' before opening the door, appearing to be breaking in, the vigilant woman explained. Able to see into the locker, she noticed shopping bags and trash that 'didn't look right.' He then closed it behind him, cops said, and Schellhas called 911. Officers responding to the storage locker around 7:30 p.m. immediately noticed a . significant amount of bombs and bomb making materials, police said at a Thursday afternoon news conference. Court documents cited by the Star Tribune say the unit was illuminated with several small lanterns, and littered with boxes of ammunition, a scale and red zinc oxide packages commonly used to make bombs. ‘If you can guess what I'm doing, I'll tell you everything,’ he told investigators, according to KEYC. When told to guess what LaDue was doing, the cop asked if he was making a bomb. ‘Yes,’ the teen replied, and then admitted to placing the bombs near a local . elementary school that were uncovered when snow began melting last . month, officials said. He . then admitted to wanting to shoot the police officer but having only a . knife in his possession when confronted at the storage unit, according . to the Mankato Free-Press. High school horror: The teen planned to terrorize Waseca Junior and Senior High School and kill as many people as possible, officials said . Officials declined to confirm at the press conference whether he intended to shoot the cop. Further questioning led to LaDue chillingly saying that he planned to kill 'as many students as he could' before the SWAT team gunned him down, according to the Star-Tribune. He also admitted to being fascinated with other school shootings and idolizing the Columbine shooters, said police. LaDue’s arsenal included an SKS assault-style rifle, a .22-cailber rifle and a Baretta handgun, according to the paper. He planned to use the .22 to kill his family because it makes less noise than the other firearms. ‘A great catastrophe and tragedy was averted,’ Waseca Mayor Roy Srp said at that same news conference. He also had made six bombs and had the components to make many more, police said. ‘I’m . very disturbed by the amount of items he had,’ said Waseca Police . captain Kris Markeson, later adding that ‘he intended to do a great . amount of harm... the amount of thought and preparation he put into this, it’s very, very complete.' Markeson later said LaDue 'intended to set off numerous bombs during the lunch hour and kill the school resource officers and set fires and shoot students and staff.' Police . found a notebook detailing minute by minute how he planned to carry out . the plot – starting with gunning down his parents and sister before . setting fire to a field to distract authorities while he stormed the . school. The plan itself involved placing pressure cooker bombs similar to the ones set off last year at the Boston Marathon inside recycling boxes in the cafeteria and shooting the school liaison officer dead before he could stop the rest of the assault, he told police. It was apparently first written in the notebook June 24, 2013, and while the semantics of the terror plot were tweaked over time, the original idea remained in tact - to kill his family, the school liaison officer and as many students as possible, the court documents revealed. End of the line: The Waseca storage facility where LaDue was arrested Tuesday night . Hartley Elementary: Bombs were found in melting snow at this school earlier this year, and LaDue admitted to making them, police said . They also did not elaborate on how he was able to obtain the guns despite being a minor. LaDue . was characterized by school superintendent Tom Lee as a quiet, . reserved, music playing kid who was on the honor roll and never got into . trouble. ‘He . had never been in trouble in school,’ said Lee. ‘I do think that people . are quite disturbed and shocked… it’s a disturbing thing.’ Classmates and other locals were shocked by the allegations. 'This little boy was shy, he never talked, always followed the leader,' Bailey Root, 19, who went to school with LaDue told the paper. 'I’m absolutely amazed. 'It was like the outcast friends kind of thing, but he had plenty of friends, she added. 'I don’t think they got bullied at all, not that I saw.' Ryan Lano, the troubled teen's guitar . teacher who posted the now infamous video to Facebook, said LaDue was . 'normal in every way... courteous' and 'polite.' 'He seemed like a good kid,' math partner Lucas Hagel told WCCO. 'You’d never expect it from him.' Best friend Eddie Persell told KMSP that even trips to the shooting range didn't hint at what LaDue was plotting. 'It's unfortunate he had to be thinking that way. I hope he gets the help he needs,' Persell told the station. 'He’s a real close friend of mine. He's real smart. He has a lot of things going for him, unfortunately he took a wrong path, I guess.' From his Facebook page: LaDue posted little online, but this post from 2012 came with remarks chiding a commenter that she did not understand what it meant but that 'people my age do' Multiple neighbors told the paper LaDue often spent time throwing knives and axes into a tree in his front yard - often enough that the bark has been stripped away. Shelly Simon originally thought he was practicing some kind of sport, now she calls the actions 'disturbing.' The . attack was originally planned by the high school junior to happen on . the 15th anniversary of the Columbine killings, but April 20 fell on . Easter Sunday this year. He intended out the attack 'within the next few weeks,' said Markeson. Police believe he acted alone, and have not uncovered any evidence to suggest otherwise. Markeson was unable to confirm or deny if the teen suffered from any mental illness. LaDue . has been ‘very cooperative,’ Markeson said before declining to comment . on whether a church window possibly blown out by a bomb earlier this . year was caused by the troubled teen. The bombs . found in melting snow at Hartley Elementary school were made with CO2 . cartridges and posed no threat to students, said Markeson. ‘One had been previously lit and could not be ignited.’ The . guitar-playing teen has admitted to setting bombs off around the small . town for months ‘to perfect them’ before carrying out what would have been a . horrific attack. Court hearing: The teen appeared at this courthouse Thursday to be charged with 10 counts . He instead faces four counts of . premeditated murder among the 12 total charges brought against him and is sitting in a juvenile detention facility far . from the weapons he planed to use to cause mass destruction in a rampage on his high . school. The would-be-gunman reportedly made 'homicidal statements' to staff at the first juvenile detention facility he was housed at and had to be transferred to a more secure one. He is due back in court May 12. A . person identified only as Cathy who answered the phone at the storage . facility said the locker was not rented by him but was is in good . standing through May. The . agreement will be revoked by the end of the month, 'as soon as I can . get the paperwork together... because I don't feel comfortable [with the . person keeping the locker],' said Cathy. She . would not disclose if the storage unit was rented by a family member or . a friend outside of saying only that it was someone over the age of 18. Authorities repeatedly praised Schellahas, despite not naming her, for 911 in the minutes before the arrest. ‘A citizen did what they should do,’ said Srp. ‘Be vigilant and pay attention to take care of each other.’","John LaDue planned to kill 'as many students as he could' in a commemoration of the Columbine massacre .

"By . Bianca London . Earlier this year Cara Delevingne posted some photographers of herself posing with a group of owls on Instagram. And whilst it seemed like just another day in the weird and wonderful world of the quirky 20-year-old, the real reason behind her seemingly random snaps has been revealed. Cara has just been announced as the star of Mulberry's autumn/winter 13 campaign, which sees her posing with her furry friends and the latest range of handbags. An owl of a time: Cara Delevingne's latest campaign sees her posing with some owl for Mulberry .

Shot on location at Shotover House in Oxfordshire, set designer Shona Heath recreated a snapshot of a wild and romantic woodland inside the manor house setting- owls and all. In a fairy tale-esque scene, Cara poses in a tree with flower-tipped branches and holds real owls as she showcases the label's latest arm candy offerings. With slicked back hair, rouge lips and rosy cheeks, the stunning model even balances the birds on her chunky block heels. The key bags featured include the Willow - as seen on Kim Sears at Wimbledon this week - as well as the new Primrose, the iconic Bayswater and its new incarnation the Bayswater Double Zip Tote in Oxblood, Taupe, Navy and Emerald.

Emma Hill, former Creative Director of Mulberry, said at the time of the shoot: ‘The Autumn Winter 2013 collection was inspired by the English countryside and cosy, familiar rural scenes but with a dark, mysterious and seductive veil. 'Traditional fables, botanical prints and the earthiness of the countryside by night all played their part, and this sense of dark beauty was beautifully captured by Tim and Ronnie for the campaign. 'After closing our London Fashion Week show, Cara was the first name in my mind for this season, she’s beautiful, bold and British!’ Obvious choice: After walking in their February show, Mulberry said Cara was the perfect model for the campaign .

"By . Sean O'hare . Support for Nigel Farage's UKIP has grown from 4.5 per cent to 15 per cent in a year . Support for the UK Independence Party (Ukip) has reached a new high of 15 per cent, up from 4.5 per cent last year, according to a new poll. The anti-EU, right-wing populist party's rating has risen by another percentage point in the past fortnight as its fortunes continue to rise, the Opinium survey for The Observer found. The party believes in the right of the people of the UK to govern themselves, 'rather than be governed by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.' Its support is almost double that for the Liberal Democrats, languishing in the same poll on 8 per cent. Labour were on 39 per cent with a 10-point lead over the Conservatives on 29 per cent. All three main parties were unchanged from a fortnight ago. Opinium interviewed 1,965 British adults between December 21 and 27. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said yesterday that 2012 had been a 'remarkable year' for the party, which has seen its ratings rise from 4.5 per cent just 12 months ago and 'become ragared as a mainstream political party'. In a New Year message, he said Ukip's performances in a series of by-elections demonstrated that it was taking votes from Labour as well as the Tories. 'I'm particularly pleased to think back to the by-elections, especially the ones we had in Corby, Rotherham, and Middlesbrough,' he said. 'What it showed was that despite the media obsession that Ukip is taking Tory votes - which of course we are - what those Northern constituencies showed is that Labour votes are coming to Ukip in real numbers too.' He also expressed delight at bringing the party's 'key campaigning issues to the centre of a national debate in this country.' Labour MP Jon Cruddas, who is chairing his party's policy review for leader Ed Miliband, predicted that Ukip would have 'a great 2013 and an even better 2014' when they could win the European elections. The anti-EU, right-wing populist party's rating has rose by a percentage in the past fortnight . In an article for the Sunday People, he said: 'My hunch is that he (Nigel Farage) and Ukip will have a great 2013 and an even better 2014 when they may top the European elections,' he said. 'For me politics was always about us (Labour) and them (Tories). Two teams, camps, gangs, crews, tribes - call them what you will - but basically left and right. I have never got the Liberals. 'But 2013 will be the breakthrough year of four-party politics - with Ukip the big winners.' Britain's relationship with the EU has been a bone of contention in recent months. Cameron is due within weeks to indicate that after the next general election he would be prepared to hold a referendum on a new EU settlement. A key architect of the European project, Jacques Delor, suggested on Fridat that the UK could be an EU 'partner' rather than a fully fledged . member of an organisation committed to ever-closer union. Mr Delors said: 'If the British do not follow the tendency towards more . integration in the European Union, we can anyway stay friends, but in . another way.' He suggested the UK might sign up for an arrangement 'like that of the . European Economic Area' or a 'free trade agreement'.

"By . Maria Lewis . While Star Wars fans around the world celebrated May the 4th - international Star Wars Day - with screenings and costumes, Los Angeles-based fanatic Dan Steininger did so with a very unique approach. The Lego Master Builder - one of only seven in the world - flew into Australia from the US to break the world record for the largest Darth Vader and Yoda figures ever created with the colourful building blocks. His Darth Vader figure stood at four metres high and Yoda at two metres - an impressive feat for the 58-year-old who gets 'paid to play'. Record breaker: The huge Darth Vader and Yoda figures were build by Lego Master Builder Dan Steininger (pictured in Sydney) 'Paid to play': Lego Master Builder Dan Steininger celebrating Star Wars Day - May the 4th - at Westfield Penrith, Sydney . Made of Lego, it is: One of his creations was a two metre high Yoda figure made from Lego . Steininger's story is a one kidault dreams are made of. First exposed to Lego when his son was seven-years-old, he became so passionate about the medium that he left a lucrative job in sales for a 'minimum wage' entry-level position at the Lego store. 'I had four kids at the time, a mortgage, and when I told my wife that I wanted to leave a job where I made twice as much to build Lego for a living she was like ""You want to do what exactly?""' he told MailOnline. 'I wish I could explain it, but I think there's something in snapping those bricks together that’s so satisfying. On top of the world! Dan poses next to his giant Darth Vader Lego figure . Use the force: The 58-year-old creating the world record breaking four metre tall Darth Vader Lego sculpture . Death Star Darth: The famous villain was first brought to life in George Lucas 1977 film Star Wars IV: A New Hope . 'In my mind, it's all that’s right with the world: you snap those two bricks together and it fits, it's a solid connection. 'It’s a good feeling.' Several years on, the risk has paid off for Steininger who is one of only seven Lego Master Builders in the world and is flown around the globe to create impressive models for children and parents alike. 'The simplest way to explain it is I get paid to play,' he said. 'When my kids were young and in school I had rock star status. 'When you meet mum and dads they get so excited that someone gets paid to do what their child has a passion for. 'I came from a background in art and sculpting, but a lot these kids go on to work in architecture or engineering as they have that gift to see things in three dimensions.' Fan celebrations: Steininger using the dark side of the force at May the 4th celebrations in Australia . Enduring popularity: The Star Wars saga has gone on to become a pop cultural icon . Visiting Australia for May the 4th Star Wars celebrations was a dream come true for Steininger, who considers George Lucas' seminal space opera one of his other passions. 'There were lines around the block to see the movie, which was unheard of at the time,' he said, talking about the first 1977 release. 'I remember seeing Star Wars IV: A New Hope with friends and walking out of the cinema taking about how we needed to immediately go and see it again because there were no doubt things that we missed. 'The good versus evil narrative, this little Yoda character stealing the hearts of young and old alike, it became a cultural icon.' Boba Fett: Fans of the science fiction space opera came together for the international day of celebration . Role call: The film's original stars (L - R) Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are returning for the new series of Star Wars movies . With the original trilogy - the prequel films - and now a whole new set of three films to be directed by Star Trek and Lost filmmaker J.J. Abrams, Steininger said he's excited to see 'new life' brought to the saga. 'To have fresh eyes looking at it and Disney involved as they own the rights, there's definitely opportunity there,' he said. The cast of the new Star Wars saga includes original stars Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and Peter Mayhew, with newcomers John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver and Domhnall Gleeson added to the mix. Star Wars prequels: Also less popular among purists, Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson, Jake Lloyd and Ewan McGregor starred in the more recent trilogy .","Darth Vader figure was four metres high and made from 250,000 bricks .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . The woman, aged in her 40s, was arrested on Friday after detectives from Essex Police examined footage from the Old Deanery Care Home in Braintree (file image) A woman has been arrested on suspicion of assaulting a resident at a care home that was the subject of an investigation by the BBC’s Panorama. The woman, aged in her 40s, was arrested on Friday after detectives from Essex Police examined footage from the Old Deanery Care Home in Braintree. She has since been released on bail, pending further inquiries. Anglia Retirement Homes Ltd, which runs the site, sacked seven members of staff there after Panorama last week showed an elderly woman with dementia being bullied and slapped. Staff in a scandal-hit care home called elderly people by their room numbers instead of using their names, the documentary revealed. The sinister habit was part of the regime at the care home where the BBC investigation uncovered widespread abuse of vulnerable residents. Astonishingly, the practice at the Old Deanery in Braintree, Essex, was observed by official inspectors during a surprise visit last autumn – but they still gave the home a clean bill of health. Officials from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) passed the scandal-hit home as safe having also apparently missed the horrific abuse which was being filmed by Panorama’s undercover cameras at the same time. It allowed the home to continue operating without sanctions – and without any of the staff being disciplined. Dementia sufferers and other elderly residents were frequently left in their own mess by staff who failed to answer their pleas. The documentary uncovered a sinister regime at Anglia Retirement Home Ltd, which has since sacked seven members of staff . The unannounced CQC inspection carried out in November found the 93-bed, £700-a-week home met approved standards on all counts. Inspectors took no action even after discovering that the staff did not use the names of residents but habitually labelled them by their room numbers. The report said: ‘We heard several staff referring to people by their room number rather than their name.’","Woman in her 40s arrested on Friday after Essex Police examined footage .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Since Apple announced its new range of tablets last week, the new iPad mini with its rumoured short supply and release date mystery has dominated headlines. This has left the build-up for today's release of Apple's new larger iPad Air feeling a little muted, yet that hasn't stopped hundreds of fans queuing for hours to get their hands on the high-end device. Customers in Australia and Japan were the among the first to get their hands on the 9.7-inch tablet as stores opened at 8am in each country. Scroll down for video . Keen: Customers stand in a queue outside Covent Garden's Apple store in a bid to one of the first to receive the new iPad Air . Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the new iPad Air, pictured, at an event in California earlier this month . Philip W. Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, unveiled the newly named iPad Air earlier this month. It is the fifth 9.7-inch model to be sold by the Californian firm and is 20 per cent thinner than the iPad 4, with a 5MP camera. Schiller also unveiled the new iPad mini which has a 7.9-inch Retina display for the first time, plus 10 hours battery life. The iPad Air is going on sale in 41 countries around the world, making it the biggest Apple tablet launch ever. As was seen with the release of . Apple's latest iPhone 5S and 5C, the new iPad is also being sold in . China from launch for the first time, as Apple attempts to attract more . of the Chinese market. By comparison, the third-generation iPad was launched in 10 countries, while last year's iPad mini and iPad 4 launched in 27. The iPad Air also went on sale on . Apple's website in various regions at midnight local time, although . reports claim only the Hong Kong store has sold out.

The release is part of a double-launch strategy in which the iPad Air is released today followed by the iPad mini 'sometime in November.' Apple has not officially announced when the new 7.9-inch model goes on sale, although rumours claim it could launch on 21 November in time for Thanksgiving in the U.S and ahead of Christmas. Reports suggest the new iPad Mini is delayed because of production problems surrounding the device's new Retina Display. Apple's tablet range received mixed scores. The 9.7-inch iPad Air, right, came second, while the iPad mini with Retina Display, left, came sixth with a score of 2512. The iPad 2 scored 502, yet it is a three-year-old model .

A customer wearing a dog mask poses with a model of a large iPad as customers wait outside an Apple store in Tokyo. The release is part of a double-launch strategy in which the iPad Air is released today followed by the iPad mini 'sometime in November' The new 2,048 x 1,536 resolution display . on the iPad mini is said to cost 'substantially more' than the 1,024 x . 768 version in the original mini. According to figures from analytics firm IHS, based on current supply data, shipments of the new iPad mini with Retina Display are expected to fall below 4 million units, and could drop as low as three million ahead of next month's release. Apple shipped around 8.9 million of its first-generation iPads earlier this year, and even this wasn't enough to satisfy demand. If Apple does ship only 3 million new devices - around a third of the old amount - it could leave at least two thirds of customers disappointed as the IHS iSuppli report predicts demand for the new tablet will exceed 9 million. Many of the other features of the tablet, including screen size, have remained the same meaning production should, in theory, be similar. 'Apple is being rather vague about the exact availability date of the new iPad mini with Retina Display, simply stating the product would ship later in November,' said Rhoda Alexander, director of tablet research at IHS. 'The company has good reason to be coy about the exact release date, given that supply of the new mini is going to be ridiculously tight in the fourth quarter.

"By . Ryan Gorman . Three men dressed as ninjas were caught Wednesday on surveillance restraining the owner of a multimillion-dollar home while they stole valuables. Bill Kitchen, 65, and Camil Espinel, 42, were tied up in his $4.5million home while the disguised thieves ransacked the home for nearly an hour. Neither was harmed during the ordeal, but one of their cars was stolen. The pair was first accosted by the two men in the home’s garage and then led inside by the three men holding weapons, police told WFTV. The robbers demanded money, jewelry and other valuables. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Brazen: Kitchen stands tied up in one of the home's rooms while a robber wears one of Espinel's hats and looks right at the security camera .

Camilo is sitting, also bound, with his head in a pillow case,’ Kitchen wrote Facebook. ‘One of the three robbers (in black Ninja suits) found Camilo's hat, and is wearing it. In the second pic, the robber sees the video camera.’ A MailOnline attempt to obtain a list of stolen items and the weapons used from Windermere Police was not successful. Held up: Bill Kitchen (left) and Camilo Espinel (right) were tied up but not harmed during the robbery . ‘We were asked to produce all money, jewelry and valuables,’ he wrote in the post. ‘For an hour they ransacked the house.’ The trio then made off in one a car owned by one of the bound men, Kitchen added. ‘It's very scary. I'm hoping that it was an isolated incident like they're saying it was and that it wasn't random and that we have nothing to worry about,’ neighbour DeeDee Lee told WKMG. Police also have not said what make or model car was taken, but did note it was found nearby. Mansion: Kitchen's home is estimated to be worth just under $4.6million .

Redman, 23, and Huber, 25, were driving along Interstate 85 in Meriweather County, Georgia, at around 7pm when they were caught in a rainstorm. According to Georgia State Police, Redman, who was behind the wheel, lost control of his 2008 IS 250 Lexus and crashed into the median at mile marker 33. Scroll down for video . Tragic end: Brittany Huber, 23 (left) was killed in a car crash that left her fiance, John Redman, 25 (right), with serious injures as the couple were driving to get married . Twisted wreckage: Georgia State Police say Huber was killed on impact when Redman lost control of his 2008 Lexus IS 250 on Interstate 85  Monday evening . Too fast: Investigators say Redman was speeding in wet conditions, which caused the car to slam into a bridge abutment . The passenger side where Huber was sitting smashed against a concrete bridge abutment, killing the woman in impact. Redman, an assitant coach at Dalton State University, was rushed to Grady Hospital to be treated for severe head trauma, broken ribs and other injuries. ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with her [Huber’s] family at this impossibly hard time. She was an amazing person loved by all who met and knew her,’ read a statement by Dalton State University Athletic Director Derek Waugh obtained by WECT. The couple’s wedding was scheduled to take place in Huber’s hometown of Mobile, Alabama, Saturday, and the pair were on their way there when the fatal accident happened. According to officials, Redman was driving too fast, and the slick road conditions did not play a role in the crash. Redman's Facebook page indicates that he and Huber had been together since the fall of 2011, and the couple got engaged last June. Final photo: Huber posted online this image of their dog, Paige, sitting in the Lexus on their way to Alabama Monday morning; the pup had to be rescued from the vehicle after the crash . Inseparable: Brittany and Redman met in 2011 and got engaged last June; they were set to get married Saturday in the woman's hometown of Mobile, Alabama . So in love: Huber had agreed to move to Georgia when Redman landed his dream job as assistant basketball coach at Dalton State University . In July 2013, the 23-year-old graduate of Spring Hill College was hired as assistant men's basketball coach at Dalton State. His fiancee worked as a kindergarten teacher’s aide at City Park Elementary School. Everyone who knew Huber and Redman described them as an inseparable couple who could not wait to get married. Dalton State basketball player Tyrel Edwards recalled to News Channel 9 how during his recruitment interview Redman was gushing about his fiancee. ‘You could tell they were just really in love and ready to get started on their marriage and their future, so just a horrible, horrible tragedy,’ City Park Elementary School Principal Rick Little said. Gifted: Huber, an aspiring artist, worked as a kindergarten teacher's aide despite her severe hearing impairment . Huber had a severe hearing impairment since she was a girl, but her students and people who met her for the first time often couldn’t pick up on it because of her uncanny ability to read lips, Times Free Press reported. In college, she had started out studying finance but switched to an art major because she wanted to do something creative with her life. The 23-year-old woman was interested in painting, pottery and photography, which could be seen from a Facebook page dedicated to her artistic endeavors, including her work with young children at a summer camp in Mobile last year. Redman’s mother, former LPGA player Susie Kirk, wrote a heartbreaking message on her Facebook page mourning her would-be daughter-in-law. ‘I miss my sweet Brittany! I am in shock!!!!!! And I do not think I can handle this terrible pain for Brittany's family and for John,’ she wrote. ‘It was Brittany and John. It was John and Brittany. End of story. They were TEAM REDMAN every day!’ Kirk said that her son was in ‘stable and comfortable condition,’ but remained on a respirator, intubated and heavily sedated. A memorial service is being held tonight for Huber at Spring Hill Baptist Church in Mobile where the couple were supposed to walk down the aisle Saturday. On the eve of their fateful road trip, Brittany wrote on her Instagram page: ‘I can't wait to ride on this journey with him and see what our amazing God has in store for us.’ The message was accompanied by a photo of the couple standing on opposite sides of a train track, with Redman handing Huber a basketball. Long road ahead: Redman, the son of veteran LPGA player Susie Kirk, remains heavily sedated and on a respirator after suffering a head trauma and multiple broken bones . The young teacher’s aid explained in her lengthy post that the ball symbolized her fiance asking her if she was willing to help him achieve his dream of becoming a college basketball coach. On Monday morning, just hours before her death, Huber posted a photo of their small white pet dog traveling in the car with them en route to Alabama. ‘It is finally wedding week!’ the bride wrote excitedly. When their Lexus smashed into a concrete pillar that evening, the first on the scene was a woman known to the victim's family only as Laura, whom their described as an 'angel.' Redman’s mother told the Dalton Daily Citizen that when the Good Samaritan saw the unconscious couple inside the mangled car, she walked up to them and joined their hands before reciting the 'Our Father' prayer. It is believed that Huber was already dead by then. Laura also came to the aid of the couple’s pup named Paige who was trapped in the smashed car, taking the animal to a veterinarian to be treated for cuts from broken glass. Brittany Huber leaves behind a brother, sister, her parents and a stepmother.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Viewers of the Eurovision Song Contest might have noticed over the years that the winning song is rarely the best. And while critics of the contest have suggested the outcome is driven by prejudice and is stitched-up at the UK’s expense, scientists have discovered other 'hidden' voting patterns. They found that votes are based on a combination of loyalties tied up with culture, geography, history and migration. Nil point for discrimination! Abba might have won the Eurovision Song Contest (pictured) in 1974 with a cracking song, but a study has found that hidden voting patterns play a part in deciding the winner. People's votes are driven by loyalties based on culture, geography, history and migration - but not discrimination . The study said people’s votes are based on loyalties based on culture, geography, history and migration and not discrimination. ‘Our analysis found no convincing evidence of negative bias or discrimination against anyone - no country really has any enemies,’ the London-based statisticians said. Migration patterns might be an explanation for why some countries often vote for certain others. In line with previous findings, the data suggests that voting congregates within four broad groups of nations that tend to give each other points. The model also revealed the presence of repeated voting behaviour over the years. Statisticians at University College London (UCL) and Imperial College London analysed voting patterns over the past two decades to identify the patterns and found no evidence to support Sir Terry Wogan’s criticism that the contest is marred by blatant bias and discrimination. Instead they think migration can tip the balance in favour of musical acts from certain countries, which will compete to win this year’s Eurovision on May 10. ‘Migration seems to be an interesting explanation for some of the patterns that we see in the data,’ said Dr Gianluca Baio of UCL. ‘For example, Turkey seems to be scored highly by German voters, possibly due to the large number of Turkish people who have migrated to Germany, and potentially tele-vote from there. ‘But our analysis found no convincing evidence of negative bias or discrimination against anyone - no country really has any enemies.’ All friends really: The study identified migration as one reason for cultural alliances being formed between certain countries, but the analysis found no convincing evidence of discrimination against anyone - no country really has any enemies . Imperial’s Marta Blangiardo analysed how countries have given points to each other since Eurovision introduced tele-voting in 1998. In the study, published in the Journal of Applied Statistics, the duo used computer analysis to reveal clusters of countries with similar voting behaviours and identified the probability of each country belonging to a particular voting bloc in any particular year. Patriotic: Turkey seems to be scored highly by German voters, possibly due to the large number of Turkish people who have migrated to Germany, the study found. Balconies in Berlin are pictured . In line with previous findings, the data suggests that voting congregates within four broad groups of nations that tend to give each other points: one combining the former Yugoslavia, Switzerland and Austria, one covering central and southern Europe; plus a larger bloc which includes the former Soviet bloc as well as the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia, which divides more-or-less randomly into two groups each year. ‘In our analysis we used what we call a “Bayesian hierarchical formulation” to model the scores,’ said Dr Blangiardo. ‘We took into account factors like the language of the song and the gender of the singer both of which have known effects on the votes. This left behind an underlying trend for us to measure. ‘This trend is based on cultural and geographical similarities, as well as migrations of people.’ The model also revealed the presence of repeated voting behaviour over the years, but the researchers said that data can only suggest whether there is bias. ‘To prove something stronger like “discrimination” or “favouritism”, we would need more complex data, for example polling on people’s motivations for voting the way they do,’ Dr Baio said. Looking at the results country by country, Greece seems to be systematically favoured by its close neighbours Cyprus and Albania, amidst a general delivery of positive votes, which is thought to be driven by widespread migrations of Greek citizens across Europe. Success mapped: In line with previous findings, the data suggests that voting congregates within four broad groups of nations that tend to give each other points: one combining countries including the former Yugoslavia, Switzerland and Austria (red), one covering central and southern Europe (blue); plus a larger area which includes the former Soviet bloc as well as the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia (yellow), which divides more-or-less randomly into two groups each year . The UK has friends, in the form of Ireland, Malta and Italy. However the effect was not substantial in the vast majority of these cases and thus does not have a dramatic impact on the likelihood of a given performer winning. Negative bias was virtually invisible in the study and the statisticians said that no country systematically gives any other low points - meaning there is no evidence of prejudice or discrimination against anyone. In the case of Albania, which was consistently relatively unpopular in the voting, the effect was very small and the authors did not consider this to statistically demonstrate a negative bias. Despite claims to the contrary, the UK’s entries do not seem to be systematically shunned by the rest of Europe. ‘It is likely that other factors beyond those we have studied explain most of the voting behaviour in the Eurovision Song Contest, as the patterns we observe are relatively weak,’ Dr Baio said. Hitting a bum note? The UK has friends in the form of Ireland, Malta and Italy. But such alliances were not found to have a dramatic impact on the likelihood of a given performer winning - and were not enough to save the UK's 2003 entry, Jemini (pictured) being awarded nil points .","Statisticians at UCL and Imperial College London analysed voting patterns over the past two decades to identify the patterns .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A larger and more powerful version of Northrop Grumman Corp's Fire Scout unmanned helicopter made its first two flights on Thursday, the U.S. Navy said as it plans to start using the new aircraft next year. The MQ-8C Fire Scout took off and flew for seven minutes in its first flight at Naval Base Ventura County in Point Mugu, California, the Navy and Northrop said in news releases. It reached an altitude of 500 feet and flew nine minutes during a second flight. Northrop said it had developed the new Fire Scout in just one year, much faster than normally seen in U.S. weapons programs. Scroll down for video . Fire Scout: The MQ-8C Fire Scout took off and flew for seven minutes in its first flight at Naval Base Ventura County in Point Mugu, California . New improved: The MQ-8C was designed to fly twice as long and carry three times as many sensors and other equipment as the current MQ-8B variant, which is on its seventh at-sea deployment for the Navy, supporting antipiracy missions on board Navy frigates . 'It is a big accomplishment for the integrated government and industry team to fly this air vehicle for the first time,' Captain Patrick Smith, the Navy's Fire Scout program manager, said in a release issued by the Navy. He said the Navy would need fewer of the new surveillance helicopters since they had a longer range and could stay airborne longer. He said that would help meet urgent needs spelled out by the U.S. Africa and Special Operation commands. Northrop said the new version of the Fire Scout was designed to fly twice as long and carry three times as many sensors and other equipment as the current MQ-8B variant, which is on its seventh at-sea deployment for the Navy, supporting antipiracy missions on board Navy frigates. Versatile: The helicopter could operate from a large number of Navy ships with smaller flight decks, giving commanders greater range and awareness . Pirate tracker: Its improved capabilities would help meet urgent needs spelled out by the U.S. Africa and Special Operation commands, the navy said . The unmanned helicopter has also been used extensively in Afghanistan since early 2011 to provide surveillance data to ground commanders. Retired Admiral Gary Roughead, the former chief of naval operations who authorized operational use of the first Fire Scout two years earlier than planned, welcomed news about the larger aircraft's first flight. 'Even though we got a lot out of the first Fire Scout, the bigger airplane with the increased attributes is going to be very important,' Roughead said. Fast turnaround: Northrop said it had developed the new Fire Scout in just one year, much faster than normally seen in U.S. weapons programs . Bigger and better: Based on a larger commercial airframe with additional fuel tanks and an upgraded engine, the MQ-8C will be able to fly up to 12 hours or carry up to 2,600 pounds . He said the helicopter could operate from a large number of Navy ships with smaller flight decks, giving commanders greater range and awareness. Based on a larger commercial airframe with additional fuel tanks and an upgraded engine, the MQ-8C will be able to fly up to 12 hours or carry up to 2,600 pounds (1,180 kg), Northrop said. George Vardoulakis, Northrop Grumman's vice president for medium-range tactical systems, said Northrop developed a bigger version of the Fire Scout after Navy operators asked for a system that could fly longer and carry more sensors. 'Changing out the airframe, installing control systems and avionics, and then conducting a first flight of the system in a year is truly remarkable,' Vardoulakis said.","The MQ-8C Fire Scout flew for 7 minutes at Naval Base Ventura County .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A longtime member of the Boy Scouts in Arizona who was accidentally outed as gay on Facebook lost out on a coveted summer job with the organization because of his sexuality, it has been claimed. Garrett Bryant, 19, was looking forward to a leadership position in Phoenix when he was told last month that he was was no longer eligible. 'I viewed my sexuality as something I was going to keep private,' Bryant told NBC News. 'It was my private life. I wasn’t going to share it with the BSA.' Scroll down for video . Upset: Garrett Bryant, seen here in an interview with MSNBC, said he was told because he had 'engaged in homosexuality' he no longer qualified for a position at a coveted summer camp . One week before he received the bad news, Bryant had updated his status on Facebook to say he was in a relationship after getting his first boyfriend. He wrote nothing further. He received many congratulatory responses, and at least one friend inquired, ""'what's his name?' Bryant realized the mistake nine to 12 hours later and removed the comments, but it was too late. He says he believes Boy Scouts officials saw the post or were told about it. When he called to ask about why he was turned down, he was told it was for having 'engaged in homosexuality'. 'They made an issue of my sexuality,' Bryant told NBC. 'I was perfectly content with staying in the closet with the Scouts.' 'But I couldn't control other people outing me, even if by accident.' Bryant first started going to the camp as an 11-year-old Boy Scout. This year the Boy Scouts began allowing openly gay teens into their ranks, but still don't allow gay adults. Bryant, a Northern Arizona University freshman, is still considered a youth for many programs in the organization, but not for all of them. Reacting: Garret Bryant posed for the NO H8 campaign, which fights against homophobia, in his Boy Scout uniform following the incident . In an interview with The New York Daily News, Bryant said he was filled with sadness over the incident. 'I felt just extreme sadness,' he said. 'I am not one to cry easily. It was pretty intense.' His mom, Kat Bryant, said she is angry about what occurred. 'The whole reason we went public with it is to bring it to light that halfway is nowhere near good enough,' she said. When Garrett turns 21, he may face more problems from the organization's rules. 'How will they [BSA] even know these people are gay unless they start digging into people’s Facebook posts?"" Scoutcamp.org webmaster Ed Henderson told NBC News. 'It’s going to create a witch hunt.'","Garrett Bryant, 19, a freshman at Northern Arizona University, had been working toward a coveted leadership role at a Boy Scout summer camp .

"By . Martin Robinson . Tragedy: James Sillcock, 26, suffocated himself last year and blamed it medication he took to control his acne . A young footballer killed himself after years of mental health problems he blamed on a controversial drug he took for his acne, an inquest heard today. James Sillcock, 26, suffocated himself just days after watching a documentary about a man who took his own life after taking the same drug, RoAccutane. He was prescribed it at 16 but stopped 18 months later when he began suffering anxiety, fatigue and blurred vision. But his family say he never got the drug 'out of his system' and was plagued by mental health problems for the next eight years. In his heartbreaking suicide note Jack Sillcock said his life had been 'perfect' - but that the drug had left his world 'in tatters'. The 20-page letter read: 'I use [sic] to love my life. There was nothing back then I would of changed. It really was perfect, and I was so lucky, with what I had. 'I could never of ever dreamt that taking RoAccutane, in the summer of 2002, ten years ago, could have brought the hell it has given me, changing my world completely, and leaving it in tatters. 'I haven't been the same person since. I live every day in misery, helplessness, despair and regret. 'How my life would have been, had I not taken RoAccutane, I will never know now. All I ever think about is 'what if'. What if I had never taken the drug?' During the inquest Medway Coroner Patricia Harding said: 'It would be right to report to the relevant authority your son's death . 'The more information relevant authorities have about cases such as these, the more information they can gather.' Evidence: The inquest heard that several others had died after taking RoAccutane, and James Sillcock's family want it banned . In November 2012 Mr Sillcock watched the BBC3 documentary Dying for Clear Skin, which told how 24-year-old Jesse James became suicidally depressed after taking RoAccutane. Shame: James Sillcock pictured with his dog Mishka, was described as a happy and popular young man but he suffered eight years of mental health problems . Ten days later, on December 9 last year, his father Melvin Sillcock, 61, found his son dead in his bedroom at the family home in Bapchild, Kent. Recording a verdict of suicide, Medway Coroner Patricia Harding said she will report the circumstances leading to James's death to the 'relevant authority'. His inquest is the second this month involving RoAccutane and his family are calling for the drug to be banned. Mr Sillcock Snr told the inquest: 'Unfortunately, once he'd [James] taken it, he couldn't get it out of his body. 'He started becoming withdrawn, stopped seeing friends and worked on his own. 'As a family we are heartbroken to have lost our son. We miss James dearly and his death was so unnecessary. I can't describe what could've been if he hadn't taken it. 'We would like to contact similar families who have suffered the same tragic circumstances through Rocaccutane to try and stop this happening to any other person and family in the future.' The talented footballer was said to be a 'normal, healthy' 16-year-old when he was prescribed it by a specialist at Chaucer Hospital, Canterbury. While the medication got rid of it his spots it also took a shocking toll on his physical and mental health, the inquest sitting at Archbishop's Palace, in Maidstone, Kent, heard. Mr Sillcock became anxious, tired and even struggled to see properly and counselling and alternative medicine had no effect on his condition. When his father suggested he see a specialist about his vision, he told him: 'They can't help me, nobody can help me'. Painful: James's family say that his death was unnecessary, picture left at 16 and right at four starting school . After watching the BBC3 documentary on RoAccutane, Mr Sillcock Snr asked him whether he felt suicidal as well, to no reply. Roaccutane was linked to nine suicide cases between September 2010 and September 2011 in the UK alone. It has been implicated in 720 reports of psychiatric problems, including more than 100 suicides and suicide attempts, according to the World HealthOrganisation (WHO). Roaccutane was pulled from US - where it was marketed as Accutane- in 2009 for 'economic reasons' according to its producers, Roche. However it still remains available on prescription in the UK. In its patient product information its manufacturer, said one in 10,000 people may suffer 'suicidal thoughts' as a side effect. In February 2010, Roche was forced to pay more than $25million (Â£16million) to a man who developed inflammatory bowel disease years after he had takenRoaccutane. Roaccutane users have also complained of bowel problems after taking the drug. Mr Sillcock Snr told the inquest: 'After watching the show I asked James, ""Are you having any dark thoughts?"" but he didn't reply.' Mr Sillcock Snr said he will make his feelings about RoAccutane known to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Outside the hearing he said: 'It's not worth the risk of what can happen to you and your body.' 'We miss James dearly and his death was so unnecessary. I can't describe what could've been if he hadn't taken it.' A spokeswoman from Roche today said: 'RoAccutane (isotretinoin) has transformed the lives of many acne sufferers, but like most medications it can have side effects. 'Whilst no definitive cause and effect relationship has been established to directly link mood swings and depression with the drug, there have been rare reports, amongst both those taking RoAccutane and acne sufferers in general. 'As a caution we recommend that anybody experiencing these, or other possible side effects with the treatment, to tell their doctor immediately. 'A study published in the British Medical Journal in 2010 concluded that people who suffer from acne are at an increased risk of suicide. 'It also concluded that there was an increased risk of attempted suicide during and after treatment with isotretinoin, but that this additional risk is most likely due to the acne rather than the treatment. The inquest is the second this month involving a youngster who has died after taking the drug. Jack Bowlby, 16, the nephew of former champion racehorse trainer Jenny Pitman, hung himself at the prestigious Cheltenham College, in Gloucestershire. Deputy Assistant Coroner Tom Osbourne recorded an open verdict but called for independent schools to put measures in place to deal with vulnerable pupils.","James Sillcock suffocated himself last year blaming drug RoAccutane .

"By . Damien Gayle . An eight-year-old girl is missing after she was snatched while playing on the swings outside her home. Monserrat Aguirre was playing with other children in the playground outside Willow Bend apartments in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when a man pulled up, grabbed her, then drove away. Witnesses said the kidnapper put his hand around Monserrat's mouth and dragged the terrified child back to his car. Amber alert: Monserrat Aguirre was snatched from a playground outside her home in Tulsa last night by a white man who drove up in a small white car, walked over, put his hand over her mouth, and dragged her off . Police hunting for Monserrat have issued an amber alert, saying her family told them they don't have any reason to believe a friend of relative was involved in the abduction. 'At this time we're calling it a complete stranger abduction,' said Tulsa police spokesman Jillian Roberson. She said most of the witnesses to the abduction were other children, but one adult was nearby and saw part of what happened. Monserrat was on the swing set outside the Willow Bend complex at around 7.20pm last night when her kidnapper, a white male, pulled up in a small white car. Officials said he approached her and three other children and spoke before dragging her off. Police were at the scene investigating the sudden abduction until late last night, reported Tulsa World's Samantha Vicent. Tulsa PD on the scene at Willow Bend apartments: Police hunting for Monserrat have issued an amber alert, after her family told them they don't have any reason to believe a friend or relative was involved in the abduction . Monserrat is Hispanic, four-foot tall, 85lbs, with black hair and brown eyes. She was wearing a white skirt with ruffles and a pink shirt when she was taken. The suspect is a white male, possibly with a beard, who was wearing a brown hat. The car he was driving could be a Ford Focus or a Ford Escape. Officer Roberson said her colleagues and members of Tulsa PD's Fugitive Warrants Unit, which includes U.S. Marshals, are looking for any cars matching the witnesses' descriptions. 'We have received many calls, and we're appreciative of the public's help,' she said.","Monserrat Aguirre was taken by a white man as she played with friends .

Besides his wife Michelle looking glamorous at his side, Obama had no shortage of female company at one of the most star-studded events in the national calendar. Jessica Simpson, Charmed actress Rose McGowan, 12 Years a Slave Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o and Modern Family star Sofia Vergara were among the beautiful and famous who hobnobbed with the capital's elite at the Washington Hilton last night. Scroll down for video . All smiles: An elegant First Lady Michelle Obama listened as her husband poked fun at his own record .

Stanchfield, the star of ABC's Scandal (left) joined TV presenter Keltie Knight . Golden girl: Starring in films including Escape From Planet Earth, Sofia Vergara is U.S. TV's top earning actress . The black-tie night is a traditional chance for the President to let down his guard and poke fun at his own regime. But it has also become a night of celebrity-spotting, home to the biggest names in film and fashion all out to impress before the cameras. Congressmen and cabinet members rubbed elbows with Hollywood stars including 12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen. Joel McHale, star of the NBC comedy . Community, followed Obama with a routine that had New Jersey Governor . Chris Christie's weight as its biggest target. Gravity director Alfonso Cuaron was a guest, as was actress Diane Lane. Television stars included Olivia Munn of The Newsroom and Juliana Margulies of The Good Wife. Julia Louis-Dreyfus was there with the cast from her hit HBO comedy Veep, parodying a dysfunctional vice president's office. A video played earlier in the evening showed her in character, asking a real-life Joe Biden: 'Are you going to the Snorespondents' dinner tonight?' Couple Jessica Simpson and fiancé Eric Johnson at the post-dinner Bloomberg & Vanity Fair cocktail reception . Screen star: Jessica Simpson as at the event, which has become as much about celeb-spotting as journalists . Art imitates life: The star-studded event had journalists at its heart and as star of The Newsroom, Olivia Munn (left) managed to cross into the worlds of news and screen stardom. Also there was actress Diane Lane (right) Demure: Russian supermodel Irina Shayk, best known for her appearances in Sports Illustrated, was one guest . Date: Sex and the City's Cynthia Nixon came to the pre-party with her wife, education activist Christine Marinoni . Celeb-spotting: Pop star and former American Idol contestant Katharine McPhee arrived in a coral pink dress . The video skit included health-conscious first lady Michelle Obama sneaking some ice cream in the White House kitchen, House of Representatives Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi getting a tattoo and House Speaker John Boehner skipping the dinner to watch a panda video in his office. The skit ended with a joke on the Hollywood-Washington romance, as Louis-Dreyfus explains slowly to Biden: 'I'm not really a V.P. but you are. I'm an actress from Hollywood.' From the bungled rollout of 'Obamacare' to New Jersey gridlock to the hue of John Boehner's tan, all was fair game for Obama when he took center stage as comedian in chief. His smiling face appearing on huge screens above the hundreds of guests, he chuckled: 'We rolled out healthcare.gov. That could have gone better. 'In 2008 my slogan was ""Yes we can."" In 2013 my slogan was ""control-alt-delete"".' On the plus side, the president said, 'they did turn the launch of healthcare.gov into one of the year's biggest movies.' On the screen flashed the poster for Frozen. Big audience: It was the 100th anniversary of the dinner, one of the biggest traditions for the Washington political corps, and as always the President shone the brightest in a star-studded audience .

Couple: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory star AnnaSophia Robb with journalist-activist Ronan Farrow . When a video Obama introduced failed to play properly, he asked, 'Does anybody know how to fix this?' To laughter, the out-going Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius stepped up and said: 'I got this. I see it all the time.' The President also wasted no time turning his jokes toward the media. 'MSNBC is here,' he said. 'They're a little overwhelmed. They've never seen an audience this big before.' Noting that he had traveled to Asia recently, Obama said: 'The lengths we have to go to to get CNN coverage these days. I think they're still searching for their table.' The president saved his sharpest jabs for another cable news network. 'The Koch brothers bought a table here tonight, but as usual they used a shadowy right-wing organization as a front,' he said. 'Hello, Fox News! 'Let's face it, Fox. You'll miss me when I'm gone. It will be harder to convince the American people that Hillary was born in Kenya.' Obama took a swipe at Fox News during his speech, saying the network will miss him when he's gone . The President touched on Obamacare, Governor Chris Christie and Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A body found hidden inside a RV that had been hired for a bachelor party is that of a 22-year-old father from Minnesota who went missing in November. Kevin Casserly, the father of two young children, had gone missing from his Anoka home on November 12. His body was discovered hidden inside a RV on Thursday by a group of friends who had hired the vehicle for a trip to the Kentucky Derby. Victim: The body of 22-year-old Kevin Casserly, who went missing in November, has been found in a rented RV . No cause of death has been released, and results are not yet available from a postmortem examination that was carried out. His body was found in an exterior compartment of a rented RV by members of a bachelor party who were trying to find the source of a foul smell. When they hired the RV, its owner, 'Rob', told the group not to use the front compartments because they were out of order. Jake Wanek, who was part of the bachelor group, said they had pulled over in Winona at about 10pm to collect a few more friends when they found the body. It 'didn’t look fresh. Let’s put it that way,' he told the Star Tribune. Dan Trainor, who the bachelor party was being held for, added that the incident felt 'like we were in the middle of a movie'. Police have not said if the owner of the vehicle has any ties to Mr Casserly. Devoted dad: Kevin Casserly had two young children and was getting his life back on track after a struggle with drugs . On Saturday, the victim's family issued a heartfelt statement on a Facebook page that had been set up to try to find Mr Casserly. 'After 24 weeks of searching, it is with heavy hearts that we share with you that Kevin’s body was recovered on Thursday,' the post read. 'To all the volunteers who helped us search for Kevin, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Words cannot express how much the support has meant to all of us and Kevin's family.' Mr Casserly was last seen at about 7.30am on November 12. He was spotted barefoot at the side of a highway. His car was found a short distance away, with an empty tank and the door open. When his mother visited his apartment to look for him she found the door slightly open but all his belongings there, including his wallet and a $20 bill on his kitchen counter. The 22-year-old, who had suffered from meth addiction in the past, was close to his mom and had been sober for a long period. He had also recently been promoted at his work. 'Nothing right now has led us to believe he's having a relapse,' his sister, Alexander, said shortly after he disappeared. 'To just disappear like this ... he wouldn't do it,. He wouldn't disappear without checking in on his kids,' she added. Gruesome find: A group of friends from Minnesota were on their way to the Kentucky Derby in a rented RV, pictured, when they found a body . Mr Casserly had a six-year-old son and four-year-old daughter who lived with his grandmother, because their mother is struggling with drug addiction. He was described as a doting father who was determined that his children would not fall into the drug problems he had. He took them to dance and karate lessons, and was working hard to get his life back on track. Members of the bachelor party who discovered his body were initially taken in for questioning by police, and later released. John Kirk, who was part of the group traveling to the annual triple crown race, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune . that he and a few of his friends were instructed by the RV’s owner, . ‘Rob,’ not to open the outside compartment because it did not work. But when . the RV rolled into Winona to collect the last of the guests outside . Shopko, one of them opened the bin, releasing a gust of bad smell into . the air. ‘I opened it up and I saw two legs and they're bruised or decomposing,’ Trainor told KTSP. Unexpected discovery: Jake Wanek, left, and the groom-to-be Dan Trainor IV, right, found the body when they investigated a weird odor coming from a container in the RV . Trainor . said that in the first few minutes, responding officers treated them as . potential suspects, but they eventually realized that the revelers had . nothing to do with the mystery man's death. The friends were taken to a police station for questioning, which lasted for two hours before they were finally let go.","Kevin Casserly was last seen barefoot at the side of a Minnesota highway on November 12 .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A Canada teen baseball player was booted from his team on Wednesday by a coach who simply didn't like the long head of hair he was growing to donate to cancer victims. Liam Nazarek, 16, of Pincher Creek, Alberta was told by coach Bryan Mackenzie that he could either sit out the season or cut his long brown locks. The teen's mom caught the coach making his announcement in video footage that has since gone viral as supportive social media users spread the word about the callous power play. Unfair: Liam Nazarek, 16, was booted from his Canada town's baseball team by a coach who hated the hair he was growing out to donate to child cancer patients . Cold: The Pincher Creek Dust Devils Coach Bryan Mackenzie (left) told Liam (right) that it didn't really make a difference that he was growing his hair to help child cancer victims . 'We've come to a decision,' says the hollow-voiced Mackenzie in the sneaky footage. 'Hair is not a rule in baseball,' Liam's mom Kimberly Jorgenson pleads to the unmoved coach. 'It is for me,' replied Mackenzie. Mackenzie doesn't even budge after he's told that Liam's growing his hair for a cancer charity, a cause very close to his young heart. 'I said it's an admirable cause (cancer),' he tells Liam. 'I'm not going to say it was going to make any difference.' The interaction becomes heated as Jorgensen continues to support her son. 'You want to coach,' barks the coach. 'There's the team. Kim, do you want to coach?' Mackenzie was was anything but accepting when he told the mother and son to simply 'accept it.' Caught: Mackenzie made his decision and told Liam and his mother Kimberly Jorgensen, who slyly caught the interaction on video . Heated: In just days, the video--in which the confrontation becomes heated as the mom defends her son--was shared thousands of times after Jorgensen posted it to Facebook . However, Jorgensen was not content to accept it. She posted her video to Facebook on Thursday, the day after her son gamely chose to spend the previous night sitting in the dugout to support his teammates. By Sunday, news of his unfortunate plight had spread to millions after the Facebook video was shared thousands of of times. 'You need to be respectful of your coach. You need to be respectful of the rules of the game. I don't think your hair has anything to do with that,' Jorgensen told CBC News. She clarified in her interview with the paper that Liam was not kicked off technically but will not be allowed to play unless he cuts his hair. Despite Mackenzie taking social media heat from across not only his own country but in the neighboring U.S., the league has come out in support of him while managing to villianize Jorgensen. 'The parent in this situation,' the league wrote in a statement, 'manipulated the the situation using social media. This is totally unacceptable if not only because it sets a terrible example for our children. There was no respect in this situation whatsoever.' In response to the decision, a nearby town has offered to let Liam join their baseball team. While he hasn't decided whether or not he will take them up on the offer, the positive feedback he's getting from across the web is certain to help cheer him up.","Liam Nazarek of Pincher Creek, Alberta, was banned from playing in the season's home opener on Wednesday for the hair he'd grown for a year .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . This is the moment a stingray photobombed a family photograph at an aquarium - and it even appears to smile at the camera. Robert and Emily Inman had taken their son Raphael, 2, for a day out at The Deep Aquarium in Hull, Yorkshire, to celebrate Robert's 30th birthday on Wednesday. Little did they know when they were taking some pictures in front of one of the tanks a cheeky Stingray would make the most of the photo op. Robert Inman and his son Raphael were enjoying a day out at Hull's The Deep Aquarium when they decided to take a family photograph - will hilarious consequences. The stingray even appears to be smiling down the lens for his starring moment . The hilarious moment took place at The Deep Aquarium in Hull, Yorkshire (pictured) It wasn't until the family got home later that day they realised one of their pictures had been hijacked. Emily, 26, a florist, from Lincoln, said: 'It was really funny, I wasn't looking through the pictures until later that day I suddenly saw it. 'Our son was enjoying the fish and we were taking pictures of everything. 'I took three in a row and deleted one before noticing this. We were in stitches. 'I don't have that much time on my . hands to pretend to have taken a picture.. This is definitely completely . genuine and perfectly timed.' Robert, . 30, an electrician, added: 'We really couldn't believe it - it is . hilarious. We had a great day and this just finished it off.' A diver with numerous stingrays - whose eyes are actually located on the top of their heads (pictured) A spokesman from the aquarium said: 'The ray in the picture is a female Bluespotted Ray which are members of the shark family. 'We have recently had this female and another join us at The Deep in the hope that they will breed with our two males. 'They are very active in our tropical lagoon exhibit, their favourite food is peeler crab. 'What looks like eyes in the photograph are actually nostrils, their eyes are actually on top of their heads.' A relative of the shark, Stingrays are most often found in temperate seas in shallow waters. They are not active animals - and spend most of their time hiding in the sand, only moving when the tide sweeps them along. They are sand-like in colour to match the seafloor - which helps them camouflage themselves so they are not attacked by larger predators. While it may look as though their faces are located on their underside, like in the picture above, that area is actually the animal's mouth, nostrils and gill slits. Their eyes are located on the top of their heads - peer out sidewards. It is because of this that scientists believe their eyes aren't used a great deal in hunting. Instead they use electtical sensors called ampullae of Lorenzini which are in their mouths. Like a shark, stingrays use these sensors to pick up on electrical charges of potential prey.","The Inman family took a trip to The Deep Aquarium in Hull, Yorkshire .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The first openly gay Episcopal bishop, who became a symbol for gay rights far beyond the church while deeply dividing the world's Anglicans, plans to divorce his husband. Bishop Gene Robinson announced the end of his marriage to Mark Andrew in an email sent to the Diocese of New Hampshire, where he served for nine years before retiring in 2012. 'As you can imagine, this is a difficult time for us -- not a decision entered into lightly or without much counseling,' he said in the email, shared by Episcopal Cafe. Robinson would not disclose details about the end of their 25-year relationship but wrote Sunday in The Daily Beast he owed a debt to Andrew 'for standing by me through the challenges of the last decade.' Happier times: In this photo released by the Episcopal Dioceses of New Hampshire, Mark Andrew, left, and Bishop V. Gene Robinson are shown during their private civil union ceremony performed by Ronna Wise in this Saturday June 7, 2008 file photo . Divorce: Bishop Gene Robinson, left, said in a column he plans to divorce his husband Mark Andrew, right . 'It is at least a small comfort to me, as a gay rights and marriage equality advocate, to know that like any marriage, gay and lesbian couples are subject to the same complications and hardships that afflict marriages between heterosexual couples,' Robinson wrote. 'All of us sincerely intend, when we take our wedding vows, to live up to the ideal of 'til death do us part. But not all of us are able to see this through until death indeed parts us.' Robinson did not respond Sunday to email and phone requests for comment from The Associated Press. Robinson has never been fully accepted within the more than 70 million-member Anglican Communion, which is rooted in the Church of England and represented in the United States by the Episcopal Church. The bishop endured death threats during his 2003 consecration and intense scrutiny of his personal life, and in 2006, he sought treatment for alcoholism. His election prompted some Episcopal dioceses and parishes to break away and establish the Anglican Church in North America with other theological conservatives overseas. Robinson was barred in 2008 by then-Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams from the Lambeth Conference, the once-a-decade global meeting of all Anglican bishops, as Williams struggled to find a way to keep Anglicans united. Embrace: Robinson is seen getting a hug from Andrew immediately after Robinson was consecrated n November 2, 2003 . But Robinson was also widely celebrated as a pioneer for gay rights, became an advocate for gay marriage and was the subject of several books and a documentary about Christianity, the Bible and same-sex relationships. He delivered the benediction at the opening 2009 inaugural event for President Barack Obama and, after retirement, became a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a Democratic think tank with close ties to the White House. Robinson, 66, had been married to a woman and had two children before he and his wife divorced. He and Andrew had been partners for more than a decade when Robinson was elected to lead the New Hampshire Diocese. The two men were joined in a 2008 civil union in New Hampshire, which became a legal marriage when the state recognized gay marriage two years later. 'My belief in marriage is undiminished by the reality of divorcing someone I have loved for a very long time, and will continue to love even as we separate,' Robinson wrote. 'Love can endure, even if a marriage cannot.' A spokeswoman for Episcopal Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori referred requests for comment to the Diocese of New Hampshire. A spokeswoman for current New Hampshire Bishop Rob Hirschfeld cited an email he sent to local clergy and wardens urging prayer for Robinson and Andrew. Robert Lundy, a spokesman for the American Anglican Council, a fellowship for theological conservatives, said the argument against gay marriage is based on the Bible and will not be helped or hurt by the dissolution of any one marriage. 'The teaching of the Bible and the Anglican Communion is very clear that marriage is the union of one man and one woman for life,' Lundy said in a phone interview. The Rev. Susan Russell, an Episcopal gay rights leader in the Diocese of Los Angeles who preached at Robinson and Andrew's union, said the end of the men's marriage was tragic, but Robinson would remain an 'icon of a faithful Christian man living out his vocation, not by his choice, but by his placement in history.' 'Of course, he'll get some slings and arrows,' Russell said in a phone interview. 'But the paradigm has shifted so dramatically that people more and more get that our marriages are no different than anyone else's marriages, and that includes the reality that some of them fail, no matter our dreams and hopes.'","Bishop Gene Robinson has announced end of his marriage to husband Mark Andrew .

"By . Francesca Chambers . When President George H.W. Bush found out his administration would serve as the inspiration for ABC's fictional political thriller Scandal, he was 'honored,' former Bush cabinet member Andrew Card said on Friday. Despite the seedy nature of the show, the former president was flattered by what the show would imply about how physically attractive he is, Card told attendees at a Scandal-themed celebrity breakfast on Friday . in Washington, D.C. Despite the seedy nature of the show, former Republican president George H.W. Bush was flattered to learn his administration would loosely serve as the basis for Scandal, former Bush cabinet member Andrew Card told attendees of Politico's Playbook Breakfast Special Celebrity Edition at the Wooly Mammoth Theatre in Washington, D.C. on Friday . Scandal is a television show about a former communications aide to a Republican president with whom the president has an on-going affair. It is based on the life of . crisis communications professional Judy Smith, who is a co-producer of . the show. Unlike her on screen counterpart, Smith did not have an affair with her boss when she served as a special assistant and . deputy press secretary to Bush. Card, who worked as Transportation Secretary for Bush, told the audience on Friday that Smith was 'very nervous' about creating a 'climate where Scandal could be embraced.' While the show . was under development, Smith called Bush to give him a head ups about . the show and the subject matter, Card recalled. 'And . the president says, ""I'm so honored,"" ' Card said. 'So there is a . degree of I'm gonna say wishful thinking that went with the show as . well.' Smith was once asked if she was involved with the president in real life. 'Absolutely not,' she said. Real-life fixer Judy Smith (left) and her on-camera counterpart Kerry Washington (right) pictured here at Variety's 5th Annual Power of Women event presented by Lifetime in October 2013, where Washington had just won an award for her portrayal of Olivia Pope on Scandal . Former . White House press secretary and the real-life inspiration for press secretary C.J. Cregg in the West Wing Dee Dee Myers said at . tbig reason people watch the show is because they think this is what . could be happening in the White House, albeit Scandal is an extreme . version of that. 'I think people think, . ""There's a lot of crazy stuff that goes on. We need to get behind the . curtain,"" ' Myers said during Friday's event, at which she also spoke. ' ""Maybe people aren't getting killed all the time, but there's . all kinds of people having relationships with people, and we know that's . true because we've read about it from, not just in politics, but across . major public institutions,"" ' she continued to tepid laughter from the audience. Myers was former president Bill Clinton's first press secretary. She was no longer working for White House when  Congress nearly stripped Clinton of his position after he lied about having an affair with then-intern Monica Lewinsky. Former presidents George W. Bush, center, Bill Clinton, left, and George H. W. Bush, right, laugh together on stage during the dedication ceremony of the National World War II Memorial in May 2004 on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. During the event Card also spoke about what it was like to serve as chief of staff to a sitting president. Card, who went on to serve as chief to the second President Bush, indicated that the role is not unlike the position is portrayed in Scandal, minus the killing. 'They end up knowing more than the President, which is scary, but they have to help decide what the President needs to know,' Card said. The chief of staff doesn't want to waste the President's time with things he doesn't need to know that other members of the government can make, Card said. Other times the chief won't tell the president things to protect him. On one occasion Card says two cabinet members wanted him to have President Bush call former Enron executive Ken Lay, and he didn't tell the president about it because he thought it was a bad idea. Lay was later indicted by a grand jury on 11 counts of fraud. 'And the president said, ""Thank you!"" ' Card recalled. ""Because even if I had told the president, and he didn't make the call, people would want to know, 'What did you talk to the president about?"" Card said. 'If he did make the call, and even if he had said, ""How you?"" and hang up, everybody would have said, ""Yeah, sure, you talked about a lot more than that. He was looking for something."" The chief of staff to the President of the United States is not just the gatekeeper of information. He or she is also responsible for sure the presidents other needs are being met so that he can focus on running the country. After Cosmo editor Joanna Coles commented that Scandal President Fitzgerald Grant always seemed to let his emotions get the best of him when it came time to make tough decisions, Card said one of the most challenging aspects of his job was keeping President Bush optimistic so that he did not poor choices. ' I focused on the president's life every minute of every day,' Card said. 'I never wanted him to be hungry, angry, lonely or tired when he had to make a decision.''I never wanted him walking into the Oval Office saying, ""I'm gonna make a bad decision today."" ' Friday's event was one of a series of events associated with Saturday evening's annual White House Correspondents Dinner. Card and Myers were joined onstage by Scandal stars Jeff Perry (Cyrus Beene) and Dan Bucatinsky (James Novak), who play the married White House chief of staff and White House press secretary on the show. Scandal stars Katie Lowes and Guillermo Diaz, who play Quinn and Huck, respectively, also made surprise appearances at the event.","As part of the annual White House Correspondents Dinner in Washington D.C. this weekend, Politico hosted a Scandal-themed breakfast .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Spider-Man can still sling it at the box office. 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' debuted with $92million in North American theaters over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. It was a solid opening for Sony's Columbia Pictures, which has released five movies about Marvel's web-slinging superhero in the last 14 years. The release of 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' essentially kicks off Hollywood's summer season and its annual parade of sequels and spectacle. Marvel movies have regularly commenced summer moviegoing in recent years, and the 'Spider-Man 2' opening begins the season with a business-as-usual blockbuster performance. Chart topper: Andrew Garfield and Dane DeHaan in 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2 . Last week's No. 1 film, the female revenge comedy 'The Other Woman,' starring Cameron Diaz, slid to a distant second with $14million in its second weekend. The rebooted 'Spider-Man' franchise starring Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone isn't performing quite as strongly as Sam Raimi's trilogy with Tobey Maguire. On opening weekends, the Raimi films grossed, in order: $114.1million, $88.2million and $151.1million. The 'The Amazing Spider-Man,' also directed by Marc Webb, opened on a Tuesday in 2012, making $62million on its debut weekend and $137million over its first six days. The new sequel, which began rolling out overseas two weeks ago, is also doing huge international business. It has already grossed $161million abroad, and it added another $116million over the weekend. That included $10.4million from China, where it opened Sunday on a record 11,002 screens. And it set a record for Hollywood titles in India with a $6.5million debut. Leading lady: Emma Stone in 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2,' the rebooted trilogy isn't doing as well as expected . 'Everywhere we opened just popped,' said Rory Bruer, head of domestic distribution for Sony. Domestically, families made up 33 percent of the audience of the PG-13 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2,' a high percentage for a superhero film. 'It did seem to have a very strong component to the film, which we felt was an opportunity,' Bruer said. ""It also lends itself to a picture that will be around the market for a while, too."" But as Hollywood's summer rolls on, the competition gets stiffer. In two weeks, Warner Bros. opens the highly anticipated monster movie 'Godzilla.' Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box-office tracker Rentrak, said that shouldn't pose problems for the Marvel juggernaut. 'In the summer, two weeks is a lot of time between blockbusters,' Dergarabedian said. 'You don't see this kind of consistency in a particular genre that often.' 'Spider-Man' follows Marvel's 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier,' released by Disney, by just a month. (The 'Captain America' sequel is still in the top 5, with $7.8million in its fifth week.) The marketplace made way for 'Spider-Man' over the weekend with no other new wide releases. Sony's 'Heaven Is for Real' continued to appeal to faith-based audiences, hauling in $8.7million in its third week. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","The rebooted trilogy is not performing as well as the most recent trio of Spider-Man films starring Tobey Maguire .

He has been charged with four counts of fourth-degree rape for his encounters with the teen, according to the Delaware News Journal. Found online: Daniel Simmons found his teen victim through an online dating app, police said . Simmons was arrested Friday after a more than one month investigation looked into his interactions with the boy, sources told the paper. That investigation found that Simmons was the primary aggressor in the encounters, authorities said. ‘These charges are serious and will be addressed through the criminal justice system,’ a state Attorney General’s Office spokesperson said. Investigators believe there may be more victims who have yet to come forward. Bail information was not immediately available, nor was his next court date.","Daniel Simmons, 34, faces four counts of fourth-degree rape .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . A controversial fire retardant chemical has been removed from some Powerade sports drinks after being taken out of Gatorade last year. Brominated vegetable oil has been removed from fruit punch and strawberry lemonade flavors in some metro areas, an indication it is being phased out due to consumer pressure. The chemical had been the target of a petition by a Mississippi teenager who questioned why it was being used in a drink marketed toward health-conscious athletes. Taking action: A controversial ingredient, brominated vegetable oil, is being removed from some Powerade sports drinks . The petition on Change.org noted that the ingredient is linked to a flame retardant and is not approved for use in Japan or the European Union. PepsiCo said last year it would drop the ingredient from Gatorade in response to customer feedback. At the time, Coca-Cola declined to say whether it would remove the ingredient from the two flavors of Powerade that contain it as well. Bottles of Powerade in fruit punch and strawberry lemonade flavors being sold in the Detroit, Michigan; Omaha, Nebraska, New York and Washington, D.C. areas no longer list the ingredient as of this week. Other bottles still list it, however, suggesting Coca-Cola may have started phasing it out recently. Representatives for the Atlanta-based company weren't immediately available to provide details on the change. The Food and Drug Administration says brominated vegetable oil is used as a stabilizer for flavoring oils in fruit-flavored drinks. Coca-Cola has said in the past that it uses the ingredient to 'improve stability and prevent certain ingredients from separating.' Already resolved: Gatorade moved last year to remove the chemical from its products . The decision by Coca-Cola to remove brominated vegetable oil from Powerade is just the latest evidence that food makers are coming under pressure for the ingredients they use. While companies stand by the safety of their products, some are making changes in response to the movement toward foods that people believe are natural. Earlier this year, for instance, Subway said it would remove an ingredient dubbed the 'yoga mat chemical' from its breads. The ingredient, azodicarbonamide, is approved for use by the FDA and can be found in a wide variety of breads. The petitioner, Vani Hari of FoodBabe.com, said she targeted Subway because of its image for serving healthy food. Likewise, brominated vegetable oil can also be found in several other drinks. But the Mississippi teenager, Sarah Kavanagh, said she targeted Gatorade and Powerade in petitions because they're designed for athletes, who are likely more concerned about what they're putting into their bodies. As Americans cut back on soda, sports drinks have become more important for Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which is based in Purchase, New York. Although Coca-Cola has long dominated rival PepsiCo on the soda front, it lags the company in the growing sports drink category. According to the industry tracker Beverage Digest, Gatorade has 64 percent of the sports drink market.","Brominated vegetable oil has been removed from some flavors, but not all .

"By . Associated Press . A Utah woman accused of killing six of her newborns and storing them in her garage couldn't recall exactly how many dead infants were in her home on the day she was arrested, according to documents made public Friday. Megan Huntsman told police on April 12 that were eight or nine dead babies in her home south of Salt Lake City, the search warrant affidavit says. Pleasant Grove Police Capt. Mike Roberts told The Associated Press they believe there were only the seven found in the garage, and that Huntsman was confused. Accused: Prosecutors have filed six first-degree murder charges against Megan Huntsman, seen in this April 28 photo, who is accused of killing her babies and storing their bodies in her garage . Huntsman told police there were eight or nine dead babies in her home - though investigators say there were only seven and that she was confused . 'She couldn't remember the exact the number so she threw a ballpark figure out there,' Roberts said. 'That was her guess.' Huntsman's comments came after police found Xanax, marijuana, bongs and a diary inside a trailer where she was living with her boyfriend in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Valley City. Roberts declined to say if that belonged to or was used by Huntsman, citing the open investigation. He said that during her interview she appeared 'perfectly normal.' Huntsman, 39, has been charged with six counts of first-degree murder. She has not entered a plea. Earlier in the day, police found the corpses of seven babies in the garage of Huntsman's house in Pleasant Grove after her estranged husband found one baby in a small white box covered with electrician's tape. He told police he discovered the baby in a plastic bag with a strong chemical odor emanating from it. Roberts told the AP that they later determined that smell was just decomposition and not chemicals. Roberts said none of the bodies were covered in chemicals. Crime scene: This April 13, 2014 file photo shows police tape in front of the scene where seven infant bodies were discovered and packaged in separate containers in Huntsman's garage . Confused? This photo provided by the Utah County jail shows accused killer Megan Huntsman . Police in Pleasant Grove discovered the six other dead babies after obtaining a search warrant for the house. They were in boxes throughout the garage, wrapped in shirts or towels, documents show. During that search, authorities also reported finding bloody leather gloves and women's underwear in the garage, and infant booties and clothes in the master bedroom. Police took stained sections of a mattress in the master bedroom as evidence. In addition, suspect Megan Huntsman told police in a phone conversation on the day the first body was found by her husband that the baby was stillborn and she had been  afraid to go to police or a hospital, the search warrant affidavit says. She didn't say why she was scared. Huntsman later acknowledged that from 1996 to 2006, she strangled or suffocated six of the babies, put them in plastic bags and packed them inside boxes in the garage south of Salt Lake City, separate court document states. Huntsman said one infant found in the garage was stillborn. Investigators say they know Huntsman's motive but declined to discuss it publicly. During a brief court appearance Monday in Provo, the shackled Huntsman mostly kept her eyes focused downward as she was informed of the charges. Defense attorney Doug Thompson told reporters afterward that he has spoken with Huntsman and she seemed fine, though he declined to provide details on her state of mind. Investigators believe West is the father of the babies. He lived with Huntsman during the decade the babies were killed and was in federal prison on drug charges from 2006 until January. Prosecutors said he is cooperating with the investigation and is not a suspect. Authorities are awaiting DNA testing to confirm Huntsman and West are the parents of the babies, and to determine the sex of the children. Their causes of death also remain uncertain. The FBI has been brought in to help because no labs in Utah can analyze the type of DNA taken from the small corpses, police said.

Cross said the couple often wrote each other such sarcastic notes. Love's sister, Nicole Jon Carroll, and an unnamed former Cobain estate employee who had examined journals for Cobain and Love have backed Love's statement, write Cross in his blog entry.

Indeed, the note found on Cobain has only add fuel to the fires of speculation regarding the circumstances of the grunge legend's suicide and what role his troubled marriage and personal life played in the final days of his life. The release of the note by Seattle police last Friday is the latest revelation to come out of the departments decision to launch an internal review of the investigation into the rock star's death. Anticipating huge media interest over the 20th anniversary of the star's suicide by shotgun, the Seattle police have decided to release dozens of never-before-seen picture from the crime scene. They also released for the first time, the investigative detective's full report on the re-opening of the case - which came to the same conclusion of suicide, two decades on. However, the sarcastic note will provide fans and conspiracy theorists hours of debate as they attempt to decipher the meaning behind the words. Was the note written in anger by a resentful Cobain, desperate to escape his unhappy marriage? Or was it a play on words penned with the knowledge of Love, that the musician carried around to remind him of their unconventional bond? Those who believe that Love was involved in her husband's death will point to the fact that the content and tone of this note wildly differs from his handwritten suicide note. New evidence: In March police in Seattle announced that new photographs of the scene of Kurt Cobain's suicide have been uncovered and developed . Scene: A police officer stands guard on the back porch of Kurt Cobain's garage where Cobain's body was found early 08 April 1994 in Seattle, WA, after an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound . The short marriage parody calls his wife a 'b****' who is 'siphoning money for doping and whoring.' This is in stark contrast to his believed suicide note which calls Love a 'goddess....who sweats ambition and empathy.' Adding to the scuzzy appeal of the note, it is written on paper from the Phoenx Hotel in San Francisco's gritty, crime-infested Tenderloin district. The Phoenix's reputation is that of an achingly cool refuge for poets and artists, very much like New York's infamous Chelsea Hotel. And earlier this month on the eve of the 20th anniversary of Kurt Cobain's suicide, the Seattle Police Department released a cache of never-before- scene photos showing the room where the Nirvana frontman was found dead in April 1994. In March, the law enforcement agency announced that it had developed 35 photos taken by officers who responded to Cobain's Seattle-area home two decades ago. A set of photographs made public by police show the troubled singer's suicide note the way he left it before taking his life April 8, 1994. CBS News reported that most of the photographs were shot on a 35mm film, which has become discolored over the years, giving the images a greenish hue. A few of the pictures were taken with a Polaroid, among them outside shots of Cobain's garage.","The note found in Kurt Cobain's wallet after he died was written by Courtney Love, says an expert .

"By . Matthew Blake . At least three miners have been killed and up to 30 are missing after an illegal gold mine collapsed in southwest Colombia. The pit, in a rural area near Santander de Quilichao, caved in at around midnight last night after a tunnel wall buckled, trapping workers underground. But as dawn broke this morning, hopes of finding survivors were beginning to fade after three bodies were pulled from the rubble. So far, three injured miners have been rescued.

Fading hopes: As dawn broke this morning, hopes of finding survivors were beginning to fade after three bodies were pulled from the rubble and three injured people . Safety fears: Colombia has been blighted by a string of mining disasters, sparking calls for an overhaul of safety laws and a crackdown on illegal mines . As anguished relatives looked on from behind a security perimeter 24 hours after the tragedy, six backhoes clawed at the earth to try to get to the missing. Incredibly, . initial rescue efforts were hampered because the owners of the mine, rather than use their own equipment to try and . rescue the missing, hid it to keep it from being seized because they had . no permit, Mining and Energy Minister Amylkar Acosta said. 'We arrived at the scene and managed to remove three bodies,' said Victor Claros, head of the firefighters in the Colombia's Cauca state, where the disaster took place. But Claros could offer little hope for those who were not pulled to safety immediately after the cave-in, saying that some of the workers were buried under 20 meters (60 feet) of earth. 'It is impossible that anyone could have survived,' Claros said. 'There is too much earth and rocks and mud.' Rescue . workers were waiting for the heavy machinery to remove enough mud to . send in sniffer dogs. But they said lots of earth still had to be shifted before this would be possible.

To make . matters worse, the number of missing could rise because so far the list is based on reports from relatives and there are concerns others may not yet . have come forward. Colombia has been luring gold prospectors since Spanish conquistadors pursued the mythical city of El Dorado. After a decline in recent decades, the industry has surged over the past five years, with exports now totalling around $33billion annually. It has become so lucrative that paramilitary guerrillas and drug gangs (known as 'Bacrims') are increasingly turning to illegal gold mining to fund their terrorist acts. Fuelled by the government's crackdown on the drugs trade and a steady increase in metals prices in recent years, this new trend has seen a fivefold jump in gold prices over the last decade. Cocaine is no longer a sufficient source of funding for 8,000-member FARC (pictured on a training exercise) because distribution - the most lucrative side of the cocaine market - is now largely controlled by Mexican cartels. It is, therefore, easier for rebel bands and criminal gangs to operate an illegal mine than a coca field. Foreign and local groups fighting for the rights of the region's indigenous inhabitants estimate that there are as many as 4,000 illegal miners working in the area near the borders with Colombia and Brazil. Luz Holanda Nazarin, 50, whose nephew was among the missing, said she had given up hope. 'Not even God knows where they are,' she said. Cauca province Gov. Temistocles Ortega said illegal miners use machinery to open huge holes to extract gold, often without providing the necessary structural support. Police, troops, civil defense and the Red Cross were aiding in rescue efforts in the mine, which is about 190 miles southwest of Bogota, the capital. Mining accidents are common in Colombia, especially at wildcat mines in poverty-stricken areas dominated by criminal gangs with little state presence. Colombia has been blighted by a string of mining disasters, sparking calls for an overhaul of safety laws and a crackdown on illegal quarries. Less than a week ago, four people were killed inhaling noxious gases following an explosion at a mine in Antioquia province that continued to operate in defiance of an order to close. Eduardo Otoya, vice president of corporate affairs at the company Continental Gold, told Radio Santa Fe that the explosion was caused by an industrial material popularly called 'crazy dust,' which generates highly toxic gases and has already claimed several lives in the gold mining zone. Last year, nine miners died after floods trapped them in an underground coal mine in northern Colombia when a subterranean water deposit ruptured and inundated the shaft 200 metres underground. In a region rich in gold, South America has seen a rise in wildcat mines, accused of tearing down rainforests and polluting . rivers with tonnes of toxic mercury, which they use to separate gold . from ore. Colombia has more than 14,000 mines, more than half of which operate without proper permits, officials said. In Colombia there are fears that left-wing guerrillas and former paramilitaries are profiting from illegal mining. Colombia has been luring gold prospectors since Spanish conquistadors pursued the mythical city of El Dorado. In the 19th century, the country was among the world’s largest producers of gold, thanks to its abundant supply. But . decades of gang warfare and administrational disarray slipped the . country down the global rankings. However, the past five years have seen . revenue from gold exports increase 10-fold, according to government . data. Colombia produces some 66 metric tons of gold per year, equating to $33billion in exports. Its two largest producers are Mineros . SA (MINEROS), based in Medellin, and Gran Colombia Gold Corp. (GCM), . based in Toronto. They account for 10 to 15 per cent of the country’s . output. The rest comes from . smaller legal endeavours, mining firms that have worked the same area . for generations tax free and without permits and those with links to . criminal or rebel groups, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of .

Guainia province, in Colombia’s eastern Amazon jungle, unlicensed miners . use makeshift barges to pan for gold from along the Inirida River. Colonel Hector Paez, acting director . of the country’s rural police division, has said that current profits . from illegal gold mining are five times greater than returns from . cocaine for rebels groups operating in Colombia. 'A kilogram of cocaine can sell for about 2,570 in the Colombian jungle, while a kilogram of gold can fetch 19 times that, or similar to global market prices,' he said.

"By . Martin Robinson . Police interviewing Gerry Adams have new evidence from a convicted IRA terrorist that may name the Sinn Fein president as the person who ordered the execution of Jean McConville, it was revealed today. A video interview of Old Bailey bomber Delours Price carried out shortly before her death last year is said to name members of the squad who abducted and murdered the mother of ten in 1972. Until today it was believed the only evidence in the hands of the police is the ‘Tapes from Beyond the Grave’ – explosive 2001 interviews with former IRA terrorists revealing notorious crimes. Damning: Police have a video of Old Bailey bomber Dolours Price giving a secret interview on the execution of Jean McConville, where she may have named Gerry Adams, right in 1971, as the man who ordered it . Interview: Gerry Adams remained in police custody here in Co Antrim, where he has been in custody since Wednesday . The audio interviews, recorded for a history project in the United States - known as the Boston College tapes - were granted only under strict condition that they were not released until after the deaths of all concerned. But after a fierce legal battle, the . secret interviews were passed to the police in Northern Ireland – and . the bombshell revelations contained on the tapes are thought to be a key . factor behind the dramatic arrest and questioning of Gerry Adams at a . police station in Antrim yesterday. They contain evidence about how Jean McConville was dragged screaming out of her west Belfast home in front of her children by IRA members who then executed her and buried her on a beach in 1972. Her body was found 31 years later but none of the 12-strong gang who abducted and killed her have ever been brought to justice. Today it was reported the Police Service of Northern Ireland have a 'newer' video with Price, which goes into further detail into how Mrs McConville was taken from her home, driven into the Republic of Ireland and shot in the back of the head. Dolours Price was the first woman to . become a member of an IRA active service unit and the leader of the . terror cell which bombed the Old Bailey in 1973. Price, . who died last year, recounted how she was chosen to be part of a small . select unit within the three battalions that made up the Belfast . Brigade. The group of eight hand-picked volunteers, labelled ‘the . Unknowns’, were responsible for ‘special operations, including internal . investigations to weed out informers’. She told Boston academics: ‘The . hardest thing I ever did was drive those people away, the Disappeared. ‘I never knew for sure their ultimate end, I was simply . told by Gerry Adams to take the people away, a couple of lads or . whatever. 'It was part of my job within the “Unknowns” to take them . across the border to hand them over to others. I don’t even remember . some of the names, isn’t that terrible?’ Murdered: At least two high-profile IRA . operatives have linked the Sinn Fein leader (right) to the murder of . Jean McConville (left), the mother of ten who was brutally abducted, . executed and secretly buried in December 1972 . Price’s interview continued: ‘I drove away Jean McConville, a very, very unpleasant woman. ‘I . know I shouldn’t speak ill of the dead and I don’t think she deserved . to die and, at the time, I didn’t know she had children. ‘I . had a call one night and Adams was in a house down the Falls Road and . she’d (McConville) been arrested by Cumann na mBan (a female wing of the . IRA) women and held for a couple of days. She got into my car and as . far as she was concerned she was being taken away by the Legion of Mary . to a place of safety. ‘It . was unfortunate for her and it was unfortunate for me as well because . she was a foul-mouthed woman who cursed and swore a lot all the way down . to the border. She went on and on about “them provies, they wouldn’t . have the balls to shoot me... I don’t care what I did”. I was saying to . myself, “please don’t say any more”, but she went on and on – she . convicted herself out of her own mouth. It wasn’t my decision to . disappear her, thank God. ‘You . don’t deserve to die if you are an unpleasant person, as she was, but . you do deserve to die if you are an informer, I do believe that. Particularly in a war, that is the Republican way.’ Removing her body: The mother of ten's body is removed from an area near Templetown beach in County Louth . Researchers . at Boston College last year lost a Supreme Court challenge in the US . when they tried to block the release of the 84 tapes after the PSNI . launched a high-profile legal challenge. So far, 11 have been handed . over relating to the McConville case. Boston College said yesterday: 'We . are not privy to the actions of British law enforcement and have had no . involvement in the matter since the U.S. court issued the order to . remand portions of the archived interviews last year'. At least . two high-profile IRA operatives have linked the Sinn Fein leader to the . murder of Jean McConville, the mother of ten who was brutally abducted, . executed and secretly buried in December 1972. The former IRA terrorists who claim they served alongside Adams say he ordered the killing. They . include two damning accounts – one of which was given by ex-hunger . striker Brendan ‘Darkie’ Hughes, a former deputy commander of the IRA’s . Belfast Brigade. Hughes, . who died in 2008, said McConville was killed on Adams’ orders. ‘There . was only one man who gave the order for that woman to be executed . . . that man is now the head of Sinn Fein,’ he said. ‘I . did not give the order to execute that woman. He did. I knew she was . being executed. I knew that. I didn’t know she was going to be buried or . disappeared as they called them now. ‘The . special squad was brought into the operation then called the Unknowns, . you know, when anyone needed to be taken away, they normally done it. I . had no control over this squad. Gerry had control over this particular . squad.’ Former friends: Gerry Adams (left) is pictured in Long Kesh prison with Brendan 'Darkie' Hughes, a former deputy commander of the IRA's Belfast Brigade. Hughes said Jean McConville was killed on Adams' orders . Denial: Adams has repeatedly denied involvement in McConville's death or the IRA policy of 'The Disappeared' The . wild card in any prosecutions could be a former IRA man called Ivor . Bell, 77, who had a bitter split with Adams in the mid-1980s. Bell’s . interviews, if accepted as admissible evidence, could be used against . Adams because Bell is still alive. Bell was charged in March with aiding . and abetting in the murder of McConville, which he denies. Adams . has repeated and categorically denied involvement in the death or the . IRA policy of ‘The Disappeared’ – men and women in Northern Ireland . suspected of being informers of the British who were taken from the . streets, questioned, shot and buried. But . the tapes and subsequent interviews allege a very different story in a . detailed series of claims which were yesterday being put to the . 65-year-old politician and architect of the Good Friday agreement.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . and Shyam Dodge . and Jessica Jerreat . Some of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas have been issued an alert about Ben Affleck, after the star was allegedly caught counting cards. After the actor was barred from playing at the Hard Rock Casino on Tuesday night, an alert was allegedly sent to other venues. On Wednesday, major Las Vegas casinos received a message saying that Affleck was 'currently suspected of advantage play'. Scroll down for video . Warned: Ben Affleck, pictured in 2009, was allegedly given a warning last week about his playing tactics . A copy of the document, seen by Radar Online, added: 'He has been observed playing blackjack at multiple Las Vegas Strip properties, and is suspected of moving his wagers with the count. Rob Olivetti, the games protection manager of Wynn and Encore casinos, had also sent out a warning in an internal email sent on April 22. In it, he claimed Affleck had been 'informed that he was being way too obvious moving his money with the count. 'He was spreading $100 -10K on the double decks and $0-20K (2@10K) on the shoe games. As of now, he is still being allowed to play per casino management.' The 41-year-old actor had been gambling at a high rollers table of the Hard Rock Casino, close to the Las Vegas strip, when he was allegedly confronted on Tuesday night for being 'too good'. Staff are said to have accused him of the tactic, which is not illegal but is a ground for being banned. Claims: Ben Affleck, pictured on Tuesday night was barred from playing blackjack at the Hard Rock casino for allegedly counting cards . The . father-of-three was in the Nevada city on vacation with his wife, Jennifer Garner, . although it is not known whether she was with him at the time. A source told MailOnline that Affleck is still welcome to the hotel and was just banned from playing blackjack. The insider said: 'Security said, ""You are too good at the game.""' The hotel was really nice about . it and told him he could play other games. They ended up getting him . and Jennifer a car back to their hotel too.' Affleck was barred from play shortly after 10pm 'due to moving his money with the count,' according to an alert from a local security firm published by Radar. A rep for the hotel made a statement on Friday, 'Mr. Affleck, a valued guest of Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, is not banned from our property and is welcome back any time,' according to Fox. Gamble: Affleck, who was on vacation with his wife, had been playing blackjack at the Hard Rock Casino . Meanwhile, the alert states that Affleck . 'uses perfect basic' - an industry term for card counting, 'but also . takes insurance according to the count.' It adds he: 'Uses black $100 cheques to keep track of the count while playing.' Radar reports that an alert was sent to surrounding casinos in Sin City the following day declaring that Affleck was 'currently suspected of advantage play.' The alleged ban comes after Affleck was warned on April 22 after he was suspected of using a similar strategy. MaiOnline has contacted Affleck's reps for comment. Tough luck: Affleck looked dishevelled as he returned to his car to find a parking ticket in Los Angeles on Friday . Aftermath: Jennifer Garner looked a bit pensive as she strolled through Brentwood on Friday . According to TMZ, the star is reported to have won $800,000 in 2001 at the Hard Rock by 'playing three $20,000 blackjack hands at once.' But he hasn't always had the best of luck as Radar claims Affleck lost $400,000 to entertainment executive Ron Meyer during a private game. Affleck is not only an avid gambler in real life but also on the silver screen as he played an online gambling mogul based in Costa Rica who is ultimately apprehended by the FBI for illegal activity in last year's thriller Runner Runner. Meanwhile, on Friday the star was spotted back in Los Angeles where he was looking a bit dishevelled as he stepped out of a building only to find that he had been issued a parking ticket. Upon discovering the citation, the star grimaced before hopping into his his 1966 Chevy Chevelle SS 396. Onscreen gambler: Affleck played an online casino mogul last year in Runner Runner opposite Justin Timberlake . Card counting is a controversial strategy in blackjack used to determine whether the next hand is likely to give a probable advantage to the player or the dealer. While the practice, first outlined by American mathematician Dr. Edward Thorp in his seminal 1962 book Beat the Dealer, is not illegal, it is highly frowned upon in the gaming industry. Getting caught keeping a tally on card values could get you booted from Las Vegas, but in New Jersey's Atlantic City it is illegal for casinos to bar card counters. Gamblers who resort to counting cards in a bid to get an edge over the casino do so by keeping a running tally of all high and low valued cards seen by the player. Card counting, or card reading as it is also known, allows players to bet more money with less risk when the count gives an advantage, like with a high concentration of aces and 10s in the deck. It also minimizes losses when the count is unfavorable to the player, which happens when there are many low cards - 4s, 5s and 6s - in the deck, which benefits the house. It is a common misconception that card counters must possess savant-like mental abilities or photographic memory like the character Raymond Babbitt portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the movie Rain Man. Instead of counting and memorizing each card, card counters assign a point score to each card they see that estimates the value of that card. The players then track the sum of these values by keeping a 'running count' - a tally. Basic card counting, known as the Hi-Lo system, assigns a positive, negative, or zero value to each card value available. When a card of that value is dealt, the count is adjusted by that card's counting value. Low cards increase the count as they increase the percentage of high cards in the remaining deck, while high cards decrease. For example, the Hi-Lo system subtracts one for each dealt ten, Jack, Queen, King or Ace, and adds one for any value from 2 to 6. Values between 7 and 9 are assigned a value of zero and have no impact on the count. The higher the count, the more players should bet because they have a greater chance of hitting a blackjack with many aces and 10s left in the deck.","Actor had been warned previously for allegedly using the tactic .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Chilling video footage appears to show a British militant taking part in the cold-blooded execution of a prisoner loyal to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. The film shows a man kneeling with his feet crossed and head bowed in a field in Syria, then being shot in the back of the head by a man armed with a pistol. Another man then fires at the prisoner with a machine gun. Researchers at the International Centre . for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) believe that this gunman is . from London and is part of a militant group called Rahat al Tawheed . (Banner of God). SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sentenced to death: The video begins with a man pointing a pistol at the prisoner's head . Chilling: After the man keels over another militant armed with an AK-47, who researchers believe is British, prepares to fire more shots . Cold-blooded: The man believed to be British then fires a volley of shots into the prisoner, though it's not clear if he's already dead at this point . After analysing the physique, wristwatch and balaclava of the man with the machine gun, ICSR concluded that it’s very probably the same man seen making pronouncements in a series of Rahat al Tawheed YouTube videos. ICSR researcher Joseph Carter told MailOnline: 'The guy with the AK-47 who fires shots into the body is in several other Rahat al Tawheed videos. On the videos the group claims to have four British brothers with them and two of those guys feature very prominently. They both wear distinctive balaclavas and big fat black watches. They're the only two who wear these watches. 'We spent a day looking at the group's YouTube videos and the footage of the execution - in which he doesn't speak - and concluded that the stature, balaclava and watch of the gunman matches that of the man in the other videos. We don't know the history of the man who was shot.' Shiraz Maher, a senior researcher at the King’s College London-based ICSR said the killing of prisoners may constitute a war crime. He told Sky News: ‘It's incredibly serious.' Plea: In one YouTube video the British fighters ask friends and relatives back home to donate money so more arms can be bought . Connection: The British militant on the left, filmed on a YouTube video urging Muslims to support jihad, is believed to be one of the gunmen that took part in the execution . Extreme viewpoint: On one Rahat al Tawheed YouTube video a fighter says 'for each arrow that is thrown at the enemies of Allah, it is as though you've freed a slave' Ayman al Zawahiri, the head of Al Qaeda, has ordered its Syrian branch, the al Nusra Front, to stop fighting rival militants as divisions are 'a gift to Assad'. The pronouncement was made by the terror chief in an audiotape that was posted online. Al Zawahiri told Al Nusra's leader, Abu Mohammed al Jolani to refocus and target Syria's ruling party, the Baath, which is run by President Bashar al Assad. He said he should 'devote himself to combat the enemies of Islam, specifically Baathists, Shiites and their allies', according to Sky News. ICSR found the footage of the killing, which took place in Raqqa in northern Syria, on the Instagram account of a man thought to be from London, and it was posted with a message describing the prisoner as ‘one of bashars [sic] dogs’. The note claimed that the man shot was a murderer and rapist. It continued: ‘Wallahi he testified to killing four brothers and raping a sister. The punishment was carried out by a dawlah shari'e. It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land.’ In separate videos posted to YouTube by Rahat al Tawheed, the man believed to have fired a machine gun at the prisoner is filmed urging Muslims in the UK to support the fighters and their families. In one, he says: ‘Whoever equips a fighter or takes care of a fighter's family, it's though he has fought himself.' He continued: ‘Brothers may have the opportunity to equip the fighter and if it's not to equip a fighter it's to look after the family of those brothers we have lost. It's not much to go to the family of a lost fighter and maybe drop 10 or 20 pounds, 40 or 50 pounds, especially if you know this woman. She is our sister. The true man that left her behind has left her behind with kids. Left to go to jihad. Where are you now, when you know this woman is in need?' In another video the man, alongside another militant, documents the machine guns, ammunition and tactical vests that were bought using donations - and urges people back in the UK to give them money so more can be purchased. The other fighter says: 'For each arrow that is thrown at the enemies of Allah, it is as though you've freed a slave. The brother [indicating the man to his left] shot three magazines. How many slaves is that?' Mr Carter said the British government should be very worried about the videos being produced by Rahat al Tawheed, as they could lead to acts of terrorism. He said: 'At the very least the major concern is that you've got British citizens producing videos inviting young people to come and fight in Syria. It's not being framed in terms of a defence narrative. It's just glorifying violence. We have to be seriously concerned about what training they have out there. 'The government should have a very thorough method of assessing people who come back. It could lead to a terrorism threat.' A UK government spokesperson said: 'This demonstrates why we have consistently called for the situation in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court. Whether this barbaric act is specifically a war crime is for a court to decide. Horrific atrocities have been committed by both the Assad regime and by extremists. The international community must ensure that all those responsible are held to account. 'We advise against all travel to Syria by British citizens. Even people travelling for well-intentioned humanitarian reasons are exposing themselves to serious risk, including being targeted for recruitment by terrorist groups. The best way to help the Syrian people is to donate to UK-registered charities that have ongoing relief operations. 'Our priority is to dissuade people from travelling, but any extremists should know we are prepared to take action to protect national security, and intelligence agencies and police are working to identify potential threats.' On Friday Syria's government and rebels agreed to a ceasefire in the battleground city of Homs to allow hundreds of fighters holed up in its old quarters to evacuate, a move that would surrender almost total control of the city once known as the 'capital of the revolution' to forces loyal to President Bashar Assad. The capture of Homs, Syria's third largest city, would be a significant victory for Assad, weeks before presidential elections set for June 3 - if the agreement goes through and rebel fighters leave. It is . feared that hundreds of young Britons are being lured to join fighting . in Syria by the ‘glamorous’ image painted in videos online. They spend months training with terrorists and then return to the UK. Some . videos have graphic pictures, videos and blogs posted by others on the . chaotic frontline. They include videos of masked militants, deadly . firefights and bomb explosions set to music as well as horrific images . of victims, including children. Last . November extraordinary pictures emerged of British jihadists fighting . alongside Al Qaeda-linked gangs in Syria. One man referred to fighting . in Syria as ‘5-star jihad’ because of its ‘relaxing’ nature. Around 400 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria over the past two years with about 20 killed. Counter-terrorism . chiefs have repeatedly highlighted the dangers posed to the UK by . fighters returning here after training with terrorists in Syria.","Chilling footage has emerged of a man being executed in a field in Syria .

"By . Jill Reilly . The carcass of a blue whale is rotting along the shoreline of a town on Canada's east coast, triggering concerns from the community it could burst. Emily Butler, the town clerk in Trout River, Newfoundland said the 28 yard blue whale is beached next to a community boardwalk and is emitting a powerful stench that is spreading through the town of 600 people. She said she and others in town are concerned that the methane gas caused by decomposition could cause the animal to burst. Scroll down for video . The carcass of a blue whale is rotting along the shoreline of a town on Canada's east coast, triggering concerns from the community it could burst . There are now concerns that the methane gas caused by decomposition could cause the animal to burst . 'We have a concern ...because I'm not sure with the heat and gases that are trapped inside of this mammal if at some point in time it will explode,' she said. But Jack Lawson, a research scientist with Canada's fisheries department, said the risk of such a blast is 'very small'. He said: 'At some point, the skin of the animal will lose some of its integrity as all of the connective tissue starts to break down. Emily Butler, the town clerk in Trout River, Newfoundland said the 28 yard blue whale is beached next to a community boardwalk and is emitting a powerful stench that is spreading through the town of 600 people . When an animal dies, bacteria inside the carcass produce methane as part of the decomposition process. If this is not let out of the body gradually it builds up, exploding at the first opportunity. Whales are the most extreme because their huge size makes the consequences of a gas build-up so much greater. Living toads in Hamburg, Germany, started spontaneously combusting in 2005. It was thought crows were picking out their livers, leaving a hole, so when the toads puffed themselves up as a defence mechanism, their whole bodies burst. 'Eventually, that gas will seep out....It will just deflate like an old balloon.' Still, . Mr Lawson said people should stay away from the 60-tonne carcass, which . could be carrying viruses or bacteria that can make people sick. 'The risk will come from somebody with a sharp blade who decides they want to cut a hole in the side to see what happens, or if someone is foolish enough to walk on it,' he said. A website has even been set up specifically to update people waiting for the whale to explode, hasthewhaleexplodedyet.com. He said he is aware of YouTube videos showing a bloated, beached sperm whale in the Faroe Islands that suddenly explodes as a scientist uses a large knife to cut open its underside. 'With this animal (in Newfoundland), it's highly unlikely that it's going to happen, especially spontaneously,' he said. The scientist said large, beached whales can either be buried with heavy equipment or cut up and shipped to a landfill. Biologist Bjarni Mikkelsen tried to cut open a sperm whale carcass which exploded in his face in November 2013 . Ms Butler asked for help from the province's environment and government services departments as well as the federal fisheries department to remove the carcass. She said the town council considered asking fishermen to tow the mammal out to sea but concluded such a task would need to be supervised by someone with expertise. 'Nobody has been properly trained in the removal of whale carcasses of this size,' she said. The whale is one of three beached along Newfoundland's west coast.","Carcass is rotting along the shoreline of a town on Canada's east coast .

"By . Tamara Cohen . Millions of households are missing out on the £50 cut to their energy bills promised by David Cameron because their supplier has not passed it on. Four of the Big Six power firms have failed to pass on the full  saving from the reduction in green levies announced last year, latest figures show. E.ON, EDF, npower and Scottish Power have offered 3.7million of their customers just £12 off. However,  British Gas and SSE gave their  customers the full saving. Critics said the failure to pass on the . full sum hands a £140million windfall to the energy giants, which had . fought hard for a drop in green levies. Millions are missing out on the £50 saving to energy bills as providers aren't passing on the saving. British Gas and SSE gave their  customers the full saving (library image) Last year, Mr Cameron promised he would ‘roll back’ the toll of the taxes which pay to insulate homes. In February, after the deal was sealed, he told the Commons: ‘It is on this side of the House that we have delivered the £50 off bills by rolling back the cost of the green levies.’ But E.ON, EDF, npower and Scottish Power did not pass this on to customers on fixed price deals, insisting these households were protected from Christmas price hikes. E.ON and Scottish Power each have a million who received £12, EDF has 1.2million and npower has 500,000. Labour, which carried out the analysis, said a one-off rebate affects everyone equally and should have been offered across the board. A spokesman for uswitch, the price comparison website, said suppliers ‘lobbied hard’ for relief from green policies which make up £112 of the average annual energy bill. E.ON, EDF, npower and Scottish Power did not pass this on to customers on fixed price deals, insisting these households were protected from Christmas price hikes (library image) ‘They made a big point that this is why they had to hike  up prices last year,’ he said. ‘All customers are hit equally by the green levies, and if there is a reduction, there is no reason fixed rate customers should miss out. Those customers should vote with their feet and switch.’ Electricity suppliers were offered a cut to the cost of the Energy Company Obligation, an insulation scheme, by slowing down its progress, shaving £30 to £35 off bills. Caroline Flint MP, Labour's energy spokesman, said: 'The companies were meant to cut everyone¿s bills in return for changes to green levies' Another £12 was cut from the Warm Front Scheme, which helps pensioners, and will now be funded by general taxation. The suppliers also promised to reduce network costs to fund a one-off reduction of £5. British Gas said it would pass a £53 cut to all customers in January. SSE followed suit with a £50 cut in March. Last autumn, the Big Six were heavily criticised after again pushing up prices well above inflation. Caroline Flint MP, Labour’s energy spokesman, said: ‘The companies were meant to cut everyone’s bills in return for changes to green levies. ‘Instead, they have been allowed to pocket the savings and millions won’t see the benefit. Yet again David Cameron has let the energy companies off the hook.’ An npower spokesman said all dual fuel customers whose bills rose in December received the full £50 cut. EDF said that it had raised prices by only 3.9 per cent, which will have saved customers money. Scottish Power said customers on most tariffs got £54 off. E.ON said most of its customers were given the full saving.","Four of Big Six firms failed to pass on saving following cut in green levies .

"By . Amanda Williams . and Lizzie Parry . Michael Wheatley, 55, a violent armed robber dubbed 'the Skull Cracker' for a string of brutal raids on banks and building societies, has gone missing after temporarily being allowed out of prison . An MP has today blasted the decision to house a violent armed robber dubbed 'the Skull Cracker' in an open prison as 'disgraceful' after the prisoner went missing when he was temporarily released. Michael Wheatley, 55, who was handed 13 life sentences at the Old Bailey in 2002, has failed to return to HMP Standford Hill open prison on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent Police said. Violent Wheatley raided 13 building societies and banks over 10 months in 2001 and 2002 while on parole from a 27-year sentence for other robberies. He earned his notorious nickname after pistol-whipping victims - including a 73-year-old woman -  during the raids. Conservative backbencher Philip Davies said that whoever had allowed Wheatley out of prison was 'a berk' and questioned why he was in an open prison in the first place. The MP for Shipley in West Yorkshire said: 'It is completely ludicrous that a serving life sentence prisoner is even in an open prison where they can simply walk out. 'As far as I am concerned whoever allowed him to be in an open prison should be sacked, it is a complete disgrace. 'The top priority for the prison service should be the protection of the public. (Justice Secretary) Chris Grayling needs to put in charge of the prison service someone who will see protection of the public as a top priority.' Police have warned the public not to approach Wheatley if they see him. A Kent Police spokesman said: 'Anyone with any information or who sees Wheatley is asked to not approach him and to instead contact police by calling 999.' Violent Wheatley, caught here on CCTV pushing a gun into his belt, raided 13 building societies and banks over 10 months in 2001 and 2002 while on parole from a 27-year sentence for other robberies . Wheatley earned his notorious nickname after pistol-whipping victims - including a 73-year-old woman -  during the raids. Pictured is one of the raids captured on CCTV . The spokesman said Wheatley, originally of Limehouse in east London, has links across south east England. Wheatley admitted 13 charges of robbery and 13 of possessing an imitation firearm - a blank firing semi-automatic pistol - in October 2002. The robberies between June 2001 and April the following year were mainly on small branches in areas he knew, ranging from Southampton in Hampshire to Royston in Hertfordshire. The first was just three weeks after he was paroled from his first prison term. As the robberies continued, so did the violence he used towards staff and customers. In March 2002 he pistol whipped a 73-year-old woman and a building society manager. The . Old Bailey heard at the time he would often grab a female customer, . putting the pistol to their head, leaving many mentally anguished. His raids netted him more than £45,000. An immitation black Bruni 8mm pistol which Wheatley used to terrorise people during his string of raids . A silver and black immitation Bruni 8mm pistol used by Wheatley during his raids on banks and building societies in 2001 and 2002 . Michael Wheatley, 55, who was sentenced at the Old Bailey in 2002, has failed to return to HMP Standford Hill open prison on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent Police said . He was given a five-year sentence on each of the firearm offences to run concurrently with the life sentences on each of the robbery charges. He was ordered to serve a minimum of eight years before being eligible for consideration for parole. A Prison Service spokesman said: 'This is now a matter for the police and we are supporting them in their investigation. 'We are toughening up the release on temporary licence scheme so that prisoners will be subject to stricter risk assessments and tagged.'","Michael Wheatley, 55, failed to return to HMP .

"By . Leon Watson . Children were told to line up according to their skin colour as part of a primary school lesson – with one boy later picked on because he was said to be the 'blackest'. Teachers at the school in South-East London told a class of around 30 children to 'organise themselves from the darkest to the lightest'. The year six children are aged between ten and 11 and school bosses said the exercise which took place last Wednesday helped them learn about ethnic diversity. Teachers at Ryelands Primary School in South Norwood, south London, told a class to 'line up according to their skin colour' Parents said they were shocked when their children came home and told them about that day's lessons. They criticised the exercise as 'highly inappropriate' and said one pupil ended up being picked on because of his skin colour. One . child's mother, who asked not to be named, said: 'Parents have told me . children laughed at one child because he was “the blackest” and argued . about who was darker and who was lighter. 'This . is not something that you want to be happening in your school. I would . be mortified if it was my child. I think it is highly inappropriate. Parents have complained but the school did not apologise for it, they . tried to explain it away.' Ryelands . Primary School in South Norwood was inspected by Ofsted in February and . placed in special measures after being rated as inadequate. It . was taken over by Oasis Community Learning and last Thursday became an . academy. Another parent, who asked not to be named, said: 'How can they . think lining up children according to their skin colour is educational? Ofsted inspected the school in February this year and it was rated 'inadequate' and placed in special measures . 'This . is totally ridiculous and I am ashamed to say my child is in this . school – I'm only glad my son only has another year to go before he can . move to another school.' Oasis . Community Learning defended the lesson, saying it was designed to . prepare children for secondary school by encouraging them to talk about . 'ethnic diversity'. A . spokesman said: 'Inclusion is our raison d'etre and we are very . committed to equality. In this instance, it was about celebrated . differences and saying it is OK to talk about them in a positive way but . recognising we are all the same underneath. 'We . fully support the teaching assistants that were involved but of course . we are always willing to listen to feedback about how we do things in . the future.' The school's . website states that it 'aspires to treat everyone inclusively and . recognises the importance of a holistic approach  to education'. Its . 'vision and values statement' says: 'At Ryelands we aim for all our . children to achieve their best in a safe and stimulating environment. 'The . Ryelands learning community also aims to develop and encourage mutual . respect, self confidence, co-operation and self-motivation. 'We . encourage our children to be enthusiastic and independent learners who . engage in the world around them with enquiring minds and compassionate . hearts.' As well as that, . the school says that it aims to 'foster respect, tolerance and love for . others, regardless of race, gender, religion or difference, within a . framework of equality of opportunity and fairness'.

"By . James Chapman . Children could be protected from scenes of sex and violence on TV by new laws following a warning from a senior Government adviser that the traditional 9pm watershed no longer works. Ministers are considering the case for legislation unless broadcasters develop their own safeguards to stop youngsters accessing inappropriate content using new ‘catch-up’ services. Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers’ Union charity, who advises Downing Street on the sexualisation and commercialisation of childhood, called for the introduction of a cinema-style ratings system for all broadcast content. Children could be protected from scenes of sex and violence on TV by new laws following a warning from a senior Government adviser that the traditional 9pm watershed no longer works . He insisted the rise in ‘time-shifted’ viewing of TV -- on the internet or other catch-up services -- meant the old 9pm watershed could not survive in its current form. ‘If you go to the age-rated system — 12, 12A, PG — it is simpler and has a high trust level,’ Mr Bailey said. Under the existing rules, broadcasters are not allowed to air material unsuitable for children before 9pm or after 5.30am. The rules exclude what is defined by Ofcom, the broadcastiing regulator, as inappropriate ‘sexual content, violence, graphic or distressing imagery and swearing’. Polls suggest the watershed still enjoys strong public backing, and parents believe 9pm is the right time for it to apply. Since 2003 broadcasters have been sanctioned more than 300 times for breaching the rules, including the screening of singer Rihanna’s sexualised music video in the afternoon. However, campaigners warn the onset of technology which increasingly allows people to choose when and how they watch material is undermining the old system. Content is being accessed through hard drives, online replay sites and box sets. Though some websites ask for an assurance people accessing or ourchasing material are over 18, critics say in many cases it is easy for teenagers and younger children to tick a box and proceed. Figures show ten per cent of all television viewing is now “time-shifted” rather than live, up fivefold over five years. For children under 16, 13 per cent of their television viewing is on catch-up services and the trend is expected to accelerate as new ‘smart TVs’ and games consoles, using high speed broadband to deliver broadcast content, become more popular. Under the existing rules, broadcasters are not allowed to air material unsuitable for children before 9pm or after 5.30am. The rules exclude what is defined by Ofcom, the broadcastiing regulator, as inappropriate 'sexual content, violence, graphic or distressing imagery and swearing' Vivienne Pattison, director of campaign group Mediawatch-UK, said: ‘I am the parent of a seven-year-old who has no concept of linear television. He has no idea of not watching when he wants to watch. ‘If you have a young teenage audience at 6.30pm and then you put out a version with extra spicy bits later at night — well, who do you think that is aimed at?’ She suggested curious youngsters were using catch-up services to watch shows as Channel 4’s The Joy of Teen Sex and My Daughter the Teenage Nudist, as well as the post-watershed spin-off of the soap opera Hollyoaks. Channel 4 insisted it protected children viewing inappropriate material on its catch-up service using Pin codes and parental locks. Tony Close, director of content standards at Ofcom, said: ‘The TV watershed is an important way to protect children. We recognise the growth of on-demand TV viewing poses new challenges. 'We are working with government to ensure that children remain protected.’ A spokesman for the Culture, Media and Sport department said: ‘More needs to be done to ensure safety measures and tools that prevent children watching post-watershed programmes, such as [parental] locks and Pin protection, are more widely used. 'We will keep progress under close review and if necessary consider the case for legislation to ensure that audiences are protected to the level they choose.’","Reg Bailey, chief executive of Mothers’ Union charity, has called for change .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A British poker ace who disappeared from his Costa del Sol mansion and was being hunted by police for allegedly stealing more than €3million from investors, has been found living in Berkshire. Playboy Nigel Goldman, 56, who counts James Hewitt and Sir Mark Thatcher among his social circle, is being investigated by the Guardia Civil and Action Fraud, the UK's fraud and internet crime reporting centre. Earlier this year the only trace of Goldman since he vanished in Marbella, was a text message to a former employer three weeks ago which read: ‘I did not set out to be a thief.’ Goldman, who drove a red Ferrari, has been found living in a modest home in the picturesque village of Kintbury, Berkshire under the alias of Howard del Monte . Spanish police were probing claims that the broker from Edgbaston in Birmingham, left people empty handed and unable to access their bank funds. However police were unable to trace him after they received complaints about his Tangier-based company, International Financial Investment. But now Goldman, who drove a red Ferrari, has been found living in a modest house in the picturesque village of Kintbury, Berkshire under the alias of Howard del Monte. Ex-pat newspaper The Olive Press, based in Spain, tracked him down using details on his eBay account Bensons Emporium. From the Costa del Sol to Berkshire: Nigel Goldman is being hunted by police for allegedly stealing more than 3million euros from investors . Goldman's lavish lifestyle seems to have been scaled down with his Ferrari being replaced with a Vauxhall Zafira . He uses the site to buy and sell coins, stamps and antiques. When approached at his Berkshire home Goldman refused to comment and his lavish lifestyle seems to have been scaled down with his Ferrari being replaced with a Vauxhall Zafira. But a neighbour said: ‘Everyone in the village knows he's Goldman, whatever name he goes under.’ Geoff Whitton, originally from Cornwall, is trying to locate €20,000 he says he handed to Goldman.The 49-year-old writer said: ‘If he's a legitimate businessman, why hasn't he contacted me? ‘I gave €10,000 in May, 2012, and €10,000 two months later. Goldman made me a profit for two months, then a loss for the same amount. Goldman is said to have moved in the same social circles as cad James Hewitt (left) and Sir Mark Thatcher . ‘For the next one-and-a-half years, I was in limbo. He'd say, ""Just trust me and you will receive a profit in October 2013"".’ Goldman, who enjoys swigging champagne and smoking expensive cigars, has a history of dishonesty, in his own book, 'High Stakes: How I Blew £14 million' published in 2006, he confesses being sent to prison twice for fraud. A review on his book reads: ‘Goldman seems to show little remorse - and more than a little contempt - for the victims whose money he lived off so handsomely.’ Despite his past, Goldman is claiming that he, and others, have been duped this time and believes his brokers were running a Ponzi scheme with everyone's money. A Ponzi scheme is an investment operation that pays returns to its investors from existing capital or new capital paid by new investors, rather than from profit earned by the individual or organisation running the operation. Goldman has admitted in writing to owing as much as £658,000 (€800,000). However a lawyer acting for investors who claim to have lost cash is stating that he is chasing €3 million, a figure rising daily. Flashy Goldman made his name at some of the world's biggest poker tournaments around the world, winning thousands. Lawyer Antonia Flores, said: ‘So far we have spoken to victims in Almeria, Malaga and Jaen. ‘In our most recent estimate it looks like reaching €3 million. ‘The first thing he did right was openly admit to all his wrongdoings and say he paid for it and was a new man. ‘That was a success. People could not talk about his past, people actually felt sorry for him. ‘It is large scale, police have not yet issued an arrest warrant, but they are not far from doing that.’ Goldman offered investments in a host of commodities including bullion, stocks and shares although he is not a regulated financial advisor due to his criminal convictions. From the Costa del Sol to this sleepy Berkshire village Kintbury . Roger Parks, a neighbour and friend of Goldman said that he even tried to get him to invest, although he chose not to, he said: ‘I have known him for 35 years. ‘When he showed me the prospectus for International Financial Investments at his palatial rented home in Elviria a few months ago, I couldn't stopped laughing. ‘By the way, has anyone else noted the initials of his company spell IFI, as if 'iffy'?’ A spokesman for Auction fraud confirmed complains had been lodged with the organisation about Goldman. If those complaints are upheld, information gathered will be passed to either the Metropolitan Police or Fraud Investigation Bureau.","Nigel Goldman, 56, investigated by Guardia Civil in Spain and Action Fraud in Britain .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A British Airways flight attendant was found dead a month after being on board a flight which left passengers terrified as the plane came into land. Andrew Barnes' body was found on Hythe Beach on April 11. He was part of the cabin crew team, who were all signed off sick after a BA flight from Heathrow arrived in Madrid. Mr Barnes, 46, was described by friends as being 'kind, gentle and lovely', and was cremated in Folkestone on Friday. It has been alleged that the pilot may have made an error as she came in to land, injuring all eight cabin crew. British Airways steward Andrew Barnes was found dead on a Kent beach, one month after he suffered a neck injury on board a flight which experienced a 'horror' landing . A friend told The Sunday Express Mr Barnes feared bosses at the airline would not believe his account of what happened to flight BA460 on March 12. The airline has conducted an investigation into what happened when the flight came into land at Madrid's Barajas airport, concluding it landed 'normally'. Some passengers were said to have claimed the flight felt 'heavy' as it hit the tarmac, with reports of cabin crew members adopting the brace position and oxygen masks dropping above people's heads and passengers screaming. But a BA spokeswoman said 'normal' means the flight data could did not record a 'heavy' landing. One passenger said: 'As the plane approached the runway, there was suddenly a huge roar and then, for what seemed like a few seconds, there was a sensation as if we were no longer flying. 'It went all quiet and then it dropped vertically with a real thud. It was awful.' The witness said the female pilot apologised for the unusual landing, blaming the wind. The airline said they have received not complaints from passengers regarding the landing. The flight BA460 from Heathrow to Madrid landed at the Spanish Barajas airport on March 12. Eight members of the cabin crew were signed off sick after the landing, during which passengers reported feeling a 'thud' and the oxygen masks dropping from above their heads . But friends of Mr Barnes said he feared he might be sacked, worrying that airline bosses would not believe his account of what happened. A friend said: 'He was really fearful. He didn't think BA would believe his story. He worried they would sack him. What happened in Madrid definitely affected him.' A BA spokeswoman said: 'The wellbeing and safety of our crew are of paramount importance to us and we have measures in place to support staff around the world. 'It is deeply distressing to learn of the death of an employee and we always endeavour to provide support for the bereaved families. 'The flight to Madrid has been thoroughly investigated by our safety team who concluded that the aircraft landed normally. 'The aircraft continued to operate flights as scheduled and we have had no contact from customers concerned about the landing.' A spokesman for Kent Police said Mr Barnes's death was not being treated as suspicious and added the details have been passed to the coroners office.

"By . James Chapman . Labour is preparing to humiliate the Liberal Democrats by backing a Conservative plan for criminals caught carrying a knife for the second time to face an automatic jail sentence. Nick Clegg was said to be 'bouncing off the walls' last week after secret Cabinet correspondence was leaked to the Daily Mail revealing senior Lib Dems are resisting Tory proposals to toughen punishments for repeat offences. Now Labour sources suggest the party is planning to exploit what has become one of the worst coalition splits since David Cameron vetoed an EU treaty in 2011 without consulting the Lib Dems. Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg appearing on BBC1's current affairs programme, The Andrew Marr Show . Ed Miliband is said to ready to back a change in the law in a vote on knife crime to be forced by the Tories in the Commons as soon next week. That would almost certainly result in the move being approved by MPs, regardless of the stance of the Lib Dems. 'We are prepared to back the amendment,' a senior Labour source said. A decision is understood to have been taken by the Labour leader's office to support tougher sentencing for knife offenders late on Friday and a vote in the Commons is expected as soon as May 12. Last week, the Mail published a leaked letter to Mr Clegg from Lib Dem Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander rejecting plans to impose a mandatory six-month jail sentence on any adult convicted of a second knife offence as too expensive. Marked 'restricted', it was sent the day after the tragic stabbing of teacher Ann Maguire. In an earlier letter to the Deputy Prime Minister, Lib Dem schools minister David Laws said mandatory minimum sentences were 'too blunt an instrument' and said he was unwilling to support them. The Deputy Prime Minister is understood to have blamed the Tories for the highly unusual breach of Cabinet confidentiality. A letter from Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander MP was leaked last week . A senior Lib Dem source said the Tories should 'examine their own consciences' over the leak, accusing them of engaging in political games in the aftermath of Mrs Maguire's killing. Tory sources said the proposal to tighten the law had been under discussion for months in advance. Conservative Cabinet ministers including Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, Theresa May, the Home Secretary, and Michael Gove, the Education Secretary and Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary, have all lined up behind the plan for tougher knife laws. Kenneth Clarke, the veteran Cabinet minister, is understood to be the only senior Tory backing the Lib Dems, arguing judges' hands should not be tied. Mr Grayling wants to use a forthcoming crime Bill to introduce automatic jail sentences for offenders caught carrying knives for a second time. Nick de Bois, the Conservative MP for Enfield North, has tabled am amendment to the Bill introduce automatic jail terms, which has already been supported by 30 Tory MPs. Backing from Labour would guarantee it would be passed by the Commons. Mr de Bois said only one in four of the 16,031 cases of knife possession last year resulted in immediate custody. 'Over 2,500 of those caught in possession of a knife last year were aged 10 to 17,' he added. 'If we need any more convincing about the weak message being sent out about carrying a knife, then we need to look no further if thousands of children don' t regard it as serious. 'I hope backbenchers from across the House will support this amendment and it can become law. 'The support across the country and amongst backbench MPs should give the Deputy Prime Minister pause to reflect on his decision. It should also give the Prime Minister the confidence that he would be in tune with both his party and the country to support this measure.'","Nick Clegg was said to be 'bouncing off the walls' after policy leak .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Bungling military officials erected a 10ft fence around a US Air Force memorial in case it 'offended Libyan soldiers'. The 'Memphis Belle' monument was erected at RAF Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire, to honour the USAF's Eighth Air Force - who were based there during the Second World War. Memphis Bell was the nickname given to the Boeing B-17F Flying Fortress bombers flown by the 91st Bomb Group (Heavy) - which suffered huge losses of men between 1942 and 1945. The US Air Force Memorial was erected at RAF Bassingbourn 20 years ago, left, but was fenced up, right, when it was announced that 2,000 Libyan soldiers were due to relocate to the base for training . But the structure was fenced off when it was announced that 2,000 Libyan soldiers were to be trained at the base. The Libyans will spend two months training at the base as part of efforts to help disarm the country's government after the removal of despot Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. After an uproar from enthusiasts and locals alike, officials have now removed the 10ft fence. The commander responsible for erecting it will be investigated in a Ministry of Defence probe. A ministry source said the official was 'some bloke with a clipboard' who oversaw an extraordinary 'error of judgement'. No official comment has been made as to why the fence was put around the monument but the source said: 'I expect the rationale was it might offend the Libyans.' The 'Memphis Belle' tribute - named after the bombers the USAF's Eight Air Force  flew - from afar. The fence has since been removed following an outcry from locals and enthusiasts alike - and a Ministry of Defence probe launched into the incident .

One group that regularly visits, Friends of the Eighth, formed almost 40 years ago.

We owe the veterans more than we can ever hope to repay - letting them or their memory down doesn't even enter the picture.' The USFA's Eighth Air Force was based at RAF Bassingbourn during the Second World War. Its 91st Bomb Group (Heavy) - who were known unofficially as 'The Ragged Irregulars' operated B017 Flying Fortress aircraft, otherwise known as the Memphis Belle bombers. Between 1942 and 1945, the unit suffered the largest number of losses of any heavy bomb group - losing 197 of its 340 aircraft in 340 operational missions. 887 of the crew were killed - around 19 per cent - and 123 were declared missing in action. Another branded the move 'disgusting', adding: 'Why do we have to put up with Britain as it is today ? It’s all going down the pan.' The 91st Bomb Group (Heavy), whose duty it was to fly in the B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft, suffered the greatest number of losses of any heavy bomb group between 1942 and 1945. The elite unit within the Eighth Air Force participated in 340 operational missions losing 197 of its aircrafts. 887 of the crew were killed - around 19 per cent - and 123 were declared missing in action. Their missions inspired both a 1944 documentary film called Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress, and a 1990 Hollywood feature film Memphis Belle. A Defence Infrastructure Organisation . spokesman said: 'A temporary screen was erected around the US War . Memorial at Bassingbourn. This has now been removed.' Libyan armed forces will be taught basic infantry skills as part of a two-month course starting next month at RAF Bassingbourn. It is part of efforts to help the Libyan government disarm and integrate militias and improve stability following the toppling of despot Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. US-Libyan relations have been strained since President Ronald Reagan ordered air strikes, code-named Operation El Dorado Canyon, in 1986. In 2011 America led military intervention in Libya and, with British naval forces, fired more than 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles during the civil war. Memphis Belle (cast pictured right) was written by Monte Merrick and  directed by Michael Caton-Jones. It had an all-star cast including Matthew Modine, Eric Stoltz and Harry Connick Jr. The film was a fictional account of the of the 1943 documentary called Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress. It was about the final, 25th mission, of the Memphis Belle. The plot of the film is as follows. In May 1943, the crew are grounded while their aircraft is repaired. Squadron aircraft begin to arrive back - but as the last bomber makes its final descent, it gets in to trouble just before landing.  It explodes, killing its crew. The next day, officers are told their target for the day is Bremen, Germany - information which riles the experienced men. They are told the squadron will be leading the attack with another 350 aircraft in their bomb group. The bombers suffer significant losses during the mission and at one point, the Belle is then tasked to lead. The remaining squadron aircraft return to the base without the Belle and they wait for its return. In a tense final few scenes, its men struggle to land the bomber - narrowly missing a crash landing. The film finishes with a dedication to all those who lost their lives in the conflict.","Monument erected at RAF Bassingbourn to honour USAF Eighth Air Force .

"By . Gavin Evans . Those of you who walk or cycle home each night will have noticed a change in the air in the past couple of weeks. All of a sudden it is spring. After a winter battling through the wind, it is a joy to cycle home late on a balmy evening, long after the rush-hour commuters have left the roads. And so, a little over a week ago, having finished giving an evening lecture at Birkbeck College in central London, I was looking forward to the five-mile cycle home to North London. It had been a long day and a glass of wine beckoned. But as I approached the cycle racks of the university campus, I realised, with a sinking heart, that my bike was gone. A feeling of impotent rage overwhelmed me. Back in the saddle: Gavin Evans with his stolen bike, which he tracked down and recovered via Gumtree . Six months earlier, my previous bike had been stolen, but that one was nearing its end and I’d used a flimsy lock. It was an annoyance, but no great loss. In fact, I’d had four bikes stolen in London — not to mention several wheels and bike light fittings. This one, though, was different. Yes, it was a bog-standard bike, but it had been newly serviced and was purring with a fresh set of gears. I’d used a strong lock in an area full of security guards. On a resentful train journey home, I cursed all bike thieves. That evening, I composed a sad moan and posted it on Facebook. I was immediately inundated with similar tales of woe. Anyone I knew who cycled had had a bike — often several — stolen. My friend Gabi consoled me with her own account of having her spanking new bike stolen when it was locked inside a bike shed at a Hampstead gym. Scene: Mr Evans's bike had been locked up in the racks outside Birkbeck College (pictured) in central London . When she called the police, they told her to look on the second-hand websites Gumtree and eBay. It only took a few minutes of searching for bikes for sale in her area to turn up her own. She told the police who advised her to set up a meeting with the thief on the pretext of wanting to buy it. The police would meet her there and make an arrest. But by the time she called the seller, he’d already sold it — for £400. Without much optimism, I began to search for bikes for sale on Gumtree in London. And, voila! The most recent bike to have been posted to the site looked just like mine. It was on sale for £90. The bike had originally cost me £200. I emailed my number to the seller and we arranged to meet on the street corner of Royal Mint Street near Tower Bridge at 9.30pm. Bike thieves, it didn’t surprise me to learn, prefer to operate from street corners, late at night. The seller, calling himself ‘Morad’, was a 20-something with a couple of scars on his face. He seemed friendly enough and let me take it for a spin. It certainly felt exactly like mine — same brakes, grips, bell, tyres, same quirks — but the street lights were too dim for me to see the markings and the bike was missing my rack, pedal clips and light fittings. I rode it for a while, but eventually decided I was only 75 per cent sure it was my bike. I didn’t want to accuse a potentially innocent young man of theft. Reluctantly, I told Morad I would think about it. I was writhing with frustration by the time I arrived home. I was convinced I’d been too forgiving. So I sent the Gumtree link to Dave, the man who originally sold me the bike. Online advertising: Without much optimism, Mr Evans began to search for bikes for sale on Gumtree . He noted that the gear shifts were different to the ones on the bike I’d bought. ‘That’s unusual. Did you have one of them changed?’ I had indeed, and the replaced gear matched the one in the picture. ‘Then it’s yours,’ he said. ‘Everything else is identical. And don’t be put off by the rack. They always sell those separately. Go get your property!’ This time, a different me was required. So that Morad wouldn’t suspect me, I needed a new name, phone number and voice. Caitlin, my younger daughter, declared that my various American accents were ‘pathetic’. The best I could come up with was a gruff Texan. I was also worried Morad would recognise me, so I disguised myself with my running club’s bobble hat and wrap-around sunglasses. That night, I told my students where I was going. ‘What if he stabs you?’ asked one as I was leaving. I remembered a scene in the U.S. cop series The Wire, where one of the characters uses a magazine inside his shirt to protect his stomach from knife wounds. So I added a magazine and a small paperback to each inside pocket of my leather jacket, just to be safe. Glancing in the mirror, I couldn’t help but think I looked a bit of a prat. Hardly Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes. This time, a more cautious Morad arrived. He told me that the bike was locked a short walk away and took me through a rough-looking housing estate. ‘Haven’t I seen you before?’ he asked suspiciously. ‘Not that I recall,’ I answered in my Texan accent. ‘I just want to buy a bike for my son.’ Morad’s greed for the £90 was enough to set aside his doubts. He unlocked the bike — my bike — and my anger bubbled up. ‘You’re a thieving piece of scum!’ I said, returning to my normal accent and removing my hat and sunglasses. ‘This bike is stolen, and it’s mine!’ Theft: According to the Metropolitan Police, an astonishing 14,079 bicycle thefts were reported in London between June and December last year (file picture) He must have been taken aback by this odd, little, middle-aged man ranting at him, but after a few seconds of nose-to-nose silence, he rallied. ‘Prove it!’ he demanded. I went through the identifying markers, Dave had pointed out to me. But Morad was having none of it. ‘Did you see me steal it? Hey? Hey?’ he yelled. ‘If I had seen you trying to steal it, it wouldn’t have been stolen. Anyway, you’re selling a stolen bike, which is a crime. We can go together to the police.’ ‘Or? Or?’ he asked. ‘Or I’ll take it with me right now.’ ‘Take it,’ he said, rather to my astonishment. He was clearly desperate to get away without the police getting involved. ‘But what about my rack? It was a new rack.’ ‘The other guys took it,’ he said, abandoning any pretence that the bike hadn’t been stolen. ‘I just sell the bikes.’ Once home, I contacted the administrative team at Gumtree to report Morad, who, by then, had removed the ad. They took a note of his details so that he couldn’t sell any further stolen property on the site. With my bike safely locked in the flat, I did some research. According to the Metropolitan Police, an astonishing 14,079 bicycle thefts were reported in London between June and December last year. This, of course, is only a small proportion of the true total because most victims don’t bother to report their loss. But by head of population, the bike-theft capital of Britain may well be Cambridge where my elder daughter, Tessa, had two well-locked bicycles stolen in one year. In the two months up to March 14 this year, 2,335 Cambridge bikes were reported as stolen. That’s nearly 40 each day. A contemporary of my daughter’s at Cambridge had an experience not unlike mine. After having her bike stolen from outside the theology faculty, she looked at Gumtree in the hope of finding a cheap replacement. There, brazenly offered for sale, was her own bike. She contacted the seller and asked to meet him. She then enlisted two friends — both rangy oarsmen from the college rowing crew — to go with her to meet the seller. At first, he’d tried to get her to meet him on a housing estate outside the city, but she insisted on a main road near to her own college. The moment the thief saw the two boys he was cagey and suspicious. He wanted to know why she had brought friends. When she confronted him about the bike and told him it was hers, he turned aggressive, shouting at her and calling her a liar. Then, before the others had time to react, he jumped on the bike and made a dash for it. The students reported the incident to the police, but the bike was never returned. The thief had used various false email addresses when he’d set up his Gumtree account and couldn’t be traced. With the knowledge that most thieves get away with it, I reported Morad to the police, who, rather to my surprise, came to my flat. As he was leaving, one of the constables offered some advice: ‘Next time, use two locks. And if it still gets stolen and you find it on Gumtree, phone us first. It’s safer that way. You were lucky.’ My advice would go further. Mark your bike in some way that only you know. If it is stolen, look on Gumtree and eBay. Contact the seller swiftly and arrange to meet. Let the police know what you plan to do. But what I’d really like to say is that if you know the bike is yours, you should ask to give it a test ride, then make your getaway, cycling furiously for home, leaving the thief in the dust. The bobble hat, sunglasses and fake American accent are, of course, optional.","Gavin Evans's bike stolen from cycle racks of Birkbeck College in London .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Newborn baby Arlo Roach strikes a claim to be Britain's youngest football fan after he was taken to his first match just 30 minutes after he was discharged from hospital. Arlo's father Anthony Roach, 39, was delighted when his fiancee gave birth four days early as it meant he could take the baby to see Torquay United's last match before the team was relegated from the football league. Following Arlo's release from Torbay Hospital yesterday, Mr Roach drove straight to the match at the Devon club's Plainmoor ground - stopping only to drop fiancee Rebekah Bancroft off at home. Proud dad: Football mad Anthony Roach took his baby Arlo to see Torquay United play just 30 minutes after the newborn was discharged from hospital . After his birth at 8.08pm on Friday night, little Arlo was discharged from hospital 15 minutes after the game kicked-off, but . thanks to his father's dedication he managed to make it in time for the . second half. 'I drove Rebekah home and made sure she was comfortable then I got off to the ground as quick as I could,' said Mr Roach. 'Luckily my boss had an executive box at the stadium, so I didn't have to try and get Arlo and his carrycot through the turnstiles. 'We only managed to arrive at half time but thankfully that meant he only had to watch one of the three goals we let in.' Family support: Mr Roach, pictured with step-daughters Courtney (left) and Summer stopped only to drop off his fiancee Rebekah Bancroft (right) before heading to the match . Mr Roach, who only lives a long free kick away from the Torquay . United ground, added: 'There was no point in taking the car - it would . have taken longer to find a parking space. 'So I walked to the ground, just like I always do, with Arlo in his carry cot.' Arlo is Mr Roach's first child, although Ms Bancroft has two daughters from a previous relationship - Courtney, nine and Summer, seven. The couple have been together two years and are engaged to be married. Mr Roach added: 'Although I can't get Rebekah interested in football, the girls already go to home and away matches with me. Youngest supporter: Little Arlo was discharged from hospital 15 minutes after the game kicked-off, but thanks to his father's dedication he managed to make it in time for the second half . 'I also am secretary and coach of a ladies football team and the girls come to watch them as well.' Torquay United, who had already been relegated, lost 3-0 to Wycombe Wanderers, saving the visitors from the drop. Mr Roach, an insurance manager, said: 'The mathematics of it all went over Arlo's head a little, but I'll be able to tell him all about it when he gets older. 'It would make a great first birthday present for him if United to get back into the League next year, but there's no way of knowing. 'I guess at least he can say he's seen a League match at Plainmoor now.' Action: Torquay United, who had already been relegated, lost 3-0 to Wycombe Wanderers, saving the visitors from the drop . Joy: Wycombe fans were thrilled after their team managed to avoid relegation, although Mr Roach says he hopes Torquay will be back in the league next year . Ms Bancroft is not a football fan but said she was quite happy for little Arlo, who weighed a healthy 9lbs 1oz, to be swept off to the stadium before he had even been inside his own home. 'We didn't even take him out of his baby seat. I went indoors with the girls and Anthony took Arlo off to the match,' she said. She added that after a 29 hour labour it was nice to have a bit of peace and quiet to relax. 'But he was lucky to get Arlo there in time at all,' she said. 'He wasn't due to be born for another four days. 'Once he came early, I knew how important it was for Anthony to get him to the match before Torquay dropped out of the football league.' Even little Arlo's name has a football theme behind it. Mr Roach explained that the name was made up of his initials, AR, and the shirt number, 10, from his playing days.","Anthony Roach wanted Arlo to see Torquay United in the football league .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Three women have made history by becoming the first female submariners to serve in the Royal Navy. Lieutenants Maxine Stiles, Alexandra Olsson and Penny Thackray have completed months of specialised training to earn their ‘Dolphins’ – the clasp worn by qualified submariners – becoming the first women in the 110-year history of the Navy's Submarine Service. For years women were unable to serve on submarines because of possible health risks but, after an independent review found that only pregnant women should not serve, Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, lifted the ban in December 2011. Lieutenants Maxine Stiles, Alexandra Olsson and Penny Thackray (left-right) have made history by becoming the first female submariners to serve in the Royal Navy . Today, Mr Hammond said: ‘This is not only a huge personal achievement for these three outstanding officers, as they take up their new roles supporting the ultimate safeguard of our national security, but also an historic moment for the Royal Navy and our armed forces.’ Following the arrival of woman officers, female ratings (non-commissioned personnel) will start training later this year with a view to serving on Vanguard submarines in 2015. Female personnel will also be able to serve on Astute-class submarines from around 2016. Ring ring goes the bell: After 110 years of the Silent Service, pioneering Lieutenants Maxine Stiles, Alex Olsson and Penny Thackray have become the first women to serve onboard a Vanguard class submarine . During their training, previously only undertaken by men, the three women officers conducted operations on nuclear-powered Vanguard-class submarine HMS Vigilant, passing their rigorous final exams with flying colours, and will now embark on careers in the Submarine Service. Lt Stiles, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, said: ‘I wanted to be able to say that I had made the most of every opportunity that I had been given in the Navy. ‘It's very intense and very challenging but that's what makes it so rewarding. At the end of it, when you get your Dolphins and are accepted into the submarine community, it's great.’ Describing the reception from the 165 male members of the 168-member crew, the 29-year-old, who has been in the Navy for four years, said: ‘As long as you can do your job and you're good at what you do, I don't think they cared whether you were male or female.’ HMS Vigilant's (pictured) commanding officer Commander Matt Dennis, who oversaw the training, said: 'I was impressed with how seamlessly the three women integrated on board' A life under the ocean wave: Lieutenants Maxine Stiles, Alexandra Olsson and Penny Thackray (left-right) have completed months of specialised training to earn their 'Dolphins' - the clasp worn by qualified submariners . Ever vigilant: Lt Penny Thackray, 39, from Hightown in West Yorkshire, will become an education oficer . Lt Olsson, 26, from Tranmere, the Wirral, was inspired to volunteer to serve on submarines after childhood visits to see HMS Onyx at the Maritime Museum in Birkenhead. She said: ‘I kept volunteering and volunteering until it came in.’ She admitted that the three women might have ‘stuck out’ on board, but said: ‘They were really receptive. Having a slower process of introducing a few females first in the officer cadre and then ratings has helped. We haven't just knocked on the door of a submarine and said 'Can we come to sea please?' ‘I felt like a little sister to 165 brothers. You live as a very strange family. Once we got qualified they were glad for us the same way they had been glad for hundreds of submariners before. ‘At the end of the day manpower is a big thing for the Navy – as long as you can do the job, it doesn't matter.’ Maxine Stiles will serve aboard HMS Vigilant as a logistics officer . She added: ‘We did a long patrol, we've come across most things people want to know about, like how you live and how the guys get on with you. ‘I know there's people who are interested but they haven't been able to make an informed decision. ‘Of course it's been challenging, but women are absolutely capable of doing this job. I think that change can always be a bit of a shock, but I look forward to seeing more and more women getting on board.’ Describing the living conditions on board, she said: ‘It's slightly more cramped that you would be used to. Actually you bring your perspective in so you don't see the lack of space anymore – you see the space that's there. ‘It's a bit of an odd place to live – everything smells the same, it all has this diesel oily smell which you have to get used to. But it's not a horrible place to live. Always a rover: Lt Olsson, 26, from Tranmere, the Wirral, was inspired to volunteer to serve on submarines after childhood visits to see HMS Onyx at the Maritime Museum in Birkenhead . ‘I managed to have a shower every day, we had laundry facilities. There was gym equipment. And food becomes a massive part of your day, it's a routine you get into.’ Lt Thackray, 39, from Hightown in West Yorkshire, said: ‘You limit your horizons. I found I just forgot about the existence of some things – someone asked me if I missed bananas. I hadn't even noticed until they mentioned it. I just forgot the outside world, you get a whole new world.’ After their training, Lt Stiles will continue her logistics officer post on board; Lt Olsson is undertaking deputy weapons engineering officer training; and Lt Thackray will become an education officer. HMS Vigilant's commanding officer Commander Matt Dennis, who oversaw their training, said: ‘I was impressed with how seamlessly the three women integrated on board. ‘They qualified without any difficulty and two of them even completed additional training whilst at sea. ‘As I would expect, they were accepted as integral members of the ship's company by the rest of the crew and have really paved the way for women on submarines to be business as usual from now on.’ Second Sea Lord Vice Admiral David Steel said: ‘Women have been serving in ships at sea with the Royal Navy for more than 20 years and integrating them into the Submarine Service completes their inclusion into all seagoing branches. ‘This is a proud day for the Royal Navy but equally a major personal achievement for these three officers, as it is for all those qualifying.’","First females in the 110-year history of the Navy's Submarine Service .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Voting conservative is contagious, a new report has found. People moving to right wing areas are more likely to vote for the Tories, according to a new study. Relocating to Tunbridge Wells, or another tradition Tory bolthole, will make you rightwing, the academic study has revealed. The research analysed the political beliefs of the 10 per cent of Britons who move home each year. People moving to Tory areas, such as Royal Tunbridge Wells (pictured) are more likely to vote Conservative a new study has found . It found that 'movers to safe . Conservative seats became more economically rightwing and more likely to . vote Conservative after the move', regardless of their political views . before. But the study found the same was not true for those moving to predominantly Labour areas. Professor Patrick Sturgis, of the University of Southampton, told The Observer: 'If you move to Tunbridge Wells from Salford, on average, people become a bit more rightwing over time. 'It is the move that is causing the change, because the comparison is with people who don't move. 'Yet we don't find the same with people moving to Labour areas. We think the reason is that people who move to Labour areas are already pretty leftwing, so there is no space for movement. 'People who move to Tory areas are more variable in their politics.' The report Places and Preferences: A Longitudinal Analysis of Self-Selection and Contextual Effects, reveals most safe Labour seats are in urban areas, including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle and Liverpool. While the study revealed voting for David Cameron's Conservative party is contagious, the same rule does not apply to people moving into predominantly Labour areas . Researchers concluded the social pressure to conform to the local majority might be less marked in socially diverse, urban areas than in rural or suburban areas, which area commonly more Tory. The study asked more than 17,300 people who moved home between 1991 and 2008, questions over their political preference. 'Individuals who live in safe Conservative constituencies are likely to support the Conservative party even immediately after moving to their new place of residence,' the report states. Professor Sturgis said people do not choose their location because of their political beliefs, but the effect of moving to a Tory areas appears to be that people will vote Conservative.","New academic study analysing the political beliefs of 17,300 people finds voting Conservative is contagious .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A mother who lost her two young sons and her entire house in last weekends Arkansas tornado says she still believes that God is 'good'. Daniel and April Smith moved to Vilonia, Arkansas with their two young boys last fall, but last Sunday their beautiful life was rip apart as third-grader Cameron and first-grader Tyler Smith, were killed when the tornado destroyed the family’s home. Their parents Daniel and April Smith were seriously injured. The whole family were sheltering beneath a mattress in a bathtub last Sunday evening when the violent twister obliterated their home. Faith: Last weeks Arkansas tornado provided many tales of both survival and grief. One mother, April Smith, who lost two sons to the storm but she still says she has kept her faith in God . Torn apart: April Smith, Vilonia tornado survivor, lost sons Cameron & Tyler in the storm, which also seriously injured her husband, Daniel . Before tragedy struck: April Smith's injuries include two broken legs and a fractured pelvis . Daniel suffered head trauma and is recovering at a separate Little Rock hospital from his wife. Despite the incredible pain and suffering the family is having to endure, a visit to April's hospital by her friend Jessica Sowards has revealed a mother who has shown remarkable courage and forgiveness after everything she has had to endure. Jessica took a photo of April laying in her hospital bed. 'Within 10 minutes of arriving at the hospital, I realized she was the same strong person, even stronger,' Ms. Sowards told Yahoo News. 'She said, ‘I’m going to miss them so bad, but I know that they’re OK. I don’t understand this, but I trust God.’' Ms. Sowards, 28, spent part of her visit lying next to her friend, as the two cried. Right for one another: Daniel and April Smith moved to Arkansas to start a beautiful family life together . Lost boys: First-grader Tyler Smith and third-grader Cameron Smith were killed Sunday when a tornado decimated their house in Vilonia, Arkansas . Perfect home, perfect life: The Smiths had the perfect family home in Arkansas . 'She is in a tremendous amount of emotional pain,' Ms. Sowards said. 'But she is not in despair. There’s a difference, and the difference is Christ.' Before leaving, Sowards asked Smith, 28, if she wanted her to take her photo in case she someday wanted to go public with how she persevered. The grieving mother agreed with one stipulation. 'Show them now,' Mrs Smith said from her hospital bed. “Show them what my God can overcome. Show them now.' Wiped away: The house was simply blown away by the devastating force of the tornado . Blessings: April Smith's sons Tyler and Cameron were the light of their lives . Seeing the light: April, who leads her church¿s deaf ministry, cried tears of joy in her hospital bed on Thursday night . Ms. Sowards went home and blogged about her friend’s incredible optimism in the face of adversity. 'For those of you who have been worried about April and Daniel, worried that they would not be the same, that they could not carry on past this loss, please don’t worry any more. I have seen her hope. It is anchored in eternity. It is the kind of hope that saves people. And that’s not just the optimist in me talking. For those of you wondering how a mother could serve a God that might allow this, understand that Tyler and Cameron knew Jesus. Just a couple of weeks ago, they led a friend to Christ. They aren’t over. Their story hasn’t reached the end. They aren’t even really gone. They’ve just moved for now. And we will miss them. Like April told Tyler on his last day on earth, we will miss them until we see them again, April and Daniel more than any of us. While none of us understand it, we must take up her lead and know that even still, God is good. And we must understand that while we may love these boys, . Divine intervention: April is a spiritual person and believes there is a reason that God broke her beautiful family apart . Devotion: April has devoted her life to the church and it seems her faith in The Lord is just as strong . God loves them infinitely more. He loves them perfectly. And with his knowledge of the lives and futures of the Smiths, God took them home.' Her faith just lifted this huge weight of pain off of me, and I knew that I couldn’t keep that to myself,' she wrote. Ms.Sowards put a link to her blog post on her Facebook wall. Within an hour, the story had 7,000 page views. In two hours, it was 21,000. By the end of the day, it had grown to 400,000. The post has now been viewed more than 1.5 million times. 'I thought I was writing for my friend to feel some relief,' Ms Sowards said. She says she is getting inundated with messages from people who say the story has inspired them to make or renew their own spiritual connections. April, who leads her church’s deaf ministry, cried tears of joy in her hospital bed Thursday night. Tyler was 7.Cameron was 9. The boys loved baseball, fishing and God . Cameron also enjoyed hunting, getting his first crack during deer season last year . Family friend Eric Hancock said Tyler, 'was a pistol, with more energy than any 16 people I know.' 'He was just a light in the world,' he said.","Thanks to a blog post by Jessica Lane Sowards, the world is learning about the lives of two victims .

A deafening explosion was followed by smaller ones as other cars caught fire and fuel ignited, they said. Queues of traffic are normal at the checkpoint where soldiers and police search vehicles since the bombing two weeks ago. Two unexploded IEDs were found at the scene, according to a security official. Islamic militants in Nigeria often time secondary explosions to target rescuers and others drawn to a bombing. Charles Osueke, who was in the area at the time of the blast, told the BBC that it was just 650ft away from the 14 April explosion. 'People in the crowd were saying that a man parked his car, walked away and the next thing they know, the car blew up,' he said.'I'm worried about our security here. After the last explosion, the president said he would increase security.'There were policemen around when this explosion happened and they didn't manage to stop it.' Boko Haram, whose name means 'Western education is sinful', are a radical group trying to establish an Islamic state in Nigeria, claiming it would halt rife government corruption. Hours after the previous April 14 car bombing, which wounded at least 141 people, Boko Haram militants kidnapped more than 250 teenage girls at a school in the remote north-east, which is their stronghold. Nobody has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but it bears all the hallmarks of Boko Haram, a group of radical Muslims attempting to establish an Islamic state in Nigeria . The blast comes on the eve of the world Economic forum in Abuja, which is expected to attract politicians, business leaders and philanthropists from across the globe to discuss Africa's economic future . About 50 of the girls escaped their captors, but 200 remain missing in a growing embarrassment for Nigeria's government and military. The US State Department says it is discussing the crisis with Nigerian officials, and will hep with the situation 'in any way we can'. The attacks have undermined government and military assurances that the Islamic extremists had been contained in a north-eastern corner of the country. Every time the military trumpets a success against the militants, they step up the tempo and deadliness of attacks. More than 1,500 people have died in the Islamic uprising this year, compared to 3,600 between 2010 and 2013. President Goodluck Jonathan told a May Day rally in Abuja earlier yesterday that the perpetrators must be brought justice. 'We shall triumph over all this evil that wants to debase our humanity or obstruct our progress as a nation,' he vowed. 'Those who want to re-define our country to be seen as a country of chaos will never succeed.' Last week, he assured the Chinese ambassador that the hundreds of delegates expected at the World Economic Forum on Africa 'will not have a problem with security during the summit'. Authorities say that several smaller, unexploded IEDs were discovered near the scene, as bombers often time them to explode when rescue workers arrive . The attack marks a sharp escalation in violence from Boko Haram. More than 1,500 people have died at the hands of the extremists this year, compared to 3,600 between 2010 and 2013 . Abuja, in the heart of the country and far from Boko Haram's northeastern stronghold, had remained relatively peaceful since a 2011 suicide car bombing of the local U.N. headquarters that killed 21 people and wounded 60. Nigeria is Africa's biggest oil producer and is the continent's most populous nation. Its 170 million people are almost equally divided between Christians and Muslims. The uprising poses the greatest threat to Nigeria's cohesion and security and imperils nearby countries where its fighters have gone to train. Fighters from Chad, Cameroon and Niger have been found among extremists in Nigeria. In May 2013, Mr Jonathan declared a state of emergency and deployed thousands of troops to the north-east after the extremists took control of entire towns and villages. Security forces quickly forced the insurgents out of urban areas but have been fighting to dislodge them from hideouts in forests and mountain caves along the border with Cameroon and Chad. Near-daily air bombardments of that area have halted since the girls and young women were abducted.","Blast happened late last night at security checkpoint near a bus stop .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A police officer was injured and a cow shot dead yesterday after a three-hour operation to round up a herd of escaped cattle. Eight of the beasts went on the run when the tractor and trailer being used to transport them overturned on near the M4 in Bradley Stoke, Bristol. The startled cattle then began wreaking havoc in the surrounding area, damaging cars and gardens. Scroll down for video . A policeman was taken to hospital and a cow was shot dead by a firearms officer after a herd of eight cattle went on the run in Bradley Stoke, Bristol, yesterday . The animals escaped after a tractor and trailer that was transporting them overturned near the M4 at 12.15pm . One of the animals was shot dead by a marksman at the request of the farmer who feared it wouldn't survive . Police arrived at the scene to try and round up the animals, but an officer suffered injuries when one of the spooked cows ran into him. He was taken to a nearby hospital but was released after being assessed by doctors. Craig Evry, Avon and Somerset police spokesman, said: 'There was an accident involving a trailer on Friday lunch time which led to a number of cows escaping. 'Officers attended the scene to try and round up the cows. One of the officers was injured after a cow ran into him and he was taken to Frenchay Hospital. 'He suffered bruising but escaped more serious injury because he had his body armour on.' During the incident, which lasted from 12.15pm to 3pm, one of the animals was shot by a firearms officer at the request of the farmer after it became 'distressed' and the farmer believed it wouldn't survive. A police spokesman was unable to say what had become of the dead cow, but added it would likely be up to the farmer to retrieve the body. Police didn't say what became of the dead cow, but added it would likely be the farmer to retrieve the body . One twitter user messaged an unconfirmed report that the dead beast ended up on a forklift truck . Keith Brett, 59, caught footage of the escaped cattle on a CCTV camera on the outside of his house . The IT consultant was out at the time of the stampede and only discovered what had happened when he returned home and checked the camera's footage . Around the time of the incident, one Twitter user from Bradley Stoke messaged to say there was a dead cow being carried around on a forklift truck. The police were unable to comment on this report. Twitter user Alex region said: 'Why the f*** is there a dead cow upside down on a forklift truck in the middle of Bradley Stoke?' At least two police cars attended the incident, along with the firearms officer, and a police helicopter was also scrambled to deal with the runaway herd, although a police spokesman refused to confirm exactly how many officers had been involved. Shocked residents returned home to find their gardens and cars gutted, including Keith Brett, 59, who was astounded when his CCTV footage showed the cow stampede. Several uniformed policemen, a marksman and a police helicopter were scrambled to deal with the rampaging cows, but a spokesman refused to confirm exactly how many officers were involved . It took officers three hours to round up the herd, by which time they had wrecked gardens and damaged cars . Roads had to be closed and other cars diverted while the farmer and police officers rounded up the cattle . The IT consultant, who lives with his wife, Leena  had been out for a walk when the cattle arrived outside their home, trampling over their garden and leaving cowpats behind. He said: 'I couldn't believe it. They came right up to our door. Luckily they didn't panic, or they could have done a lot more damage.' His wife added: 'It's just unbelievable. We came back from our walk to a total commotion. 'The cows and bulls had walked all the way through our close. There was cow mess everywhere and they had trampled on two cars.' A number of cars were damaged by the rogue animals, including a Vauxhall Corsa, which was left with a dented bonnet after one of the animals ran over it. These plant pots were smashed after the cows ran through a suburban cul-de-sac in Bristol . The Vauxhall Corsa was also damaged after one animal spooked and ran across the bonnet . The car owner, Jane Williams, 46, said: 'As I went to turn right at the bottom of the road the cows crossed my path. 'I parked on the road and looked up to the top where I could see some people and the police. 'They were massive animals but they were obviously terrified. 'They came through the side of the drive, smashing up my pots. They bashed into the car and I saw one go up on the car. The damage isn't too bad but it's got to be dealt with.' Despite the damage, the receptionist saw the funny side, adding: 'It was absolutely amazing, coming up the road to see cows here. 'They churned up some gardens but when you invite cows into your cul-de-sac, what do you expect?'","Cows escaped after trailer used to transport them overturned near the M4 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . First Nigel Farage was branded a chicken - then he was hit with an egg. The Ukip leader's position as a member of the political establishment was confirmed as he was pelted with an egg as he arrived yesterday to campaign in Nottingham. Now protestor Frederick Glenister - who branded Ukip 'sad, scared, old men' during the leader's visit to the town - has been charged with common assault. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage was pelted with an egg while on a visit to Nottingham . Aides were quick to bundle Mr Farage away from the scene . The incident puts Mr Farage in good . company: David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have all been . targetted by egg throwers. Mr Farage arrived in Nottingham to rally support for his East Midlands candidates for the European elections. But as he got out of a car in the city centre he was hit by the egg on his left shoulder. He quickly got back into the car which drove off leaving supporters behind. Mr Glenister, who was holding a placard which said: 'Ukip sad, scared, old men', was put . into a patrol car by police and driven away. The 33-year-old, from Radford, Nottingham, was later charged with the offence and bailed to appear at the city's magistrates' court later this month. Mr Farage, meanwhile, lived up to his . reputation and head to the to the Bell Inn in the city centre and . ordered a pint of Robin Hood beer. He told reporters: 'I've been before (to the city) but today's visit was a very brief one I'm afraid. 'I . saw about 15 seconds of it. It's quite tough to judge. Some of the . inhabitants are not all that friendly. I'm sure that's not the view of . most.' The incident happened within seconds of Mr Farage stepping out of his car and heading to meet Ukip supporters in the city . The incident came barely 24 hours after Mr Farage faced claims of being a . 'chicken' for refusing to stand in a by-election in Newark . He accused the media of whipping up a storm around the 'injudicious, or in a couple of cases, offensive comments from a handful of people' after a series of damaging headlines about racist and sexist comments made by cancidates and supporters. 'It's whipped up this kind of storm of hatred among some on the left. 'They're organised, they're taxpayer funded and they're going around the country chasing me around trying to stop us from getting our message out. 'That is a fundamentally anti-democratic thing to do. It's not good and it's not healthy.' Later, when asked about allegations of racism, Mr Farage said: 'It's remarkable. You've got 77% of the British population in the British Social Altitude Survey, including over 60% of first and second-generation migrants, who think we need border controls. 'The truth of it is we now have an open door to 485 million people and I want to debate that over the course of the next three weeks. I tried with Nick Clegg to debate this issue - he ignored me. 'Cameron and Miliband won't engage with it. But I think despite all the distractions, I think out there in the street people are debating it and the commonsense position is to say 'Look, immigration sensiblycontrolled can be a positive thing for society and for our economy but we must have control over the quantity and quality of those that come to our country'. 'We now have this farcical situation where if you're a skilled person from India or New Zealand, you probably won't get in because we have an open door to Romania and Bulgaria and that is absolutely mad from every perspective. 'And I think with this we're right at the centre of where the British public feels, and what we're arguing for is actually very moderate, very logical, and for the establishment to come out and cry racist shows how devoid of any other argument they are."" Mr Farage said Ukip would give people back 'their pride and their country'. Nottinghamshire Police confirmed a man from the city has been arrested on suspicion of assault. A force spokeswoman said: 'Police were called to a report of an assault in Wheeler Gate, Nottingham, at 1.30pm today. 'A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and is in police custody.' The incident came barely 24 hours after Mr Farage faced claims of being a 'chicken' for refusing to stand in a by-election in Newark. Mr Farage was smiling for the cameras as the protestor approached him and hurled the egg . Mr Farage cowered as he was struck by the egg in front of a crowd of supporters . Several Ukip visits have had to be scaled back or cancelled to avoid a clash with protesters . Mr Farage was quickly bundled into his official car before speeding off - and heading for a pub . Ukip supporters appeared alarmed by the drama which meant their party leader was quickly ferried away from the scene . He threw away the . chance to become an MP within weeks as he ruled himself out of being the Ukip candidate. Opponents . accused the Ukip leader of 'bottling it' and being 'frit' for not contesting the Tory seat of . Newark vacated by shamed MP Patrick Mercer. Labour frontbencher Rachel Reeves said: 'I'm not surprised that Nigel Farage doesn't want to fight in Newark. 'He . bottles it when there's a real contest, and when he has a chance to . prove that people want him as a member of parliament he backs away and . he's done that again.' Tory defence minister Anna Soubry said on Twitter: 'Niger Farage is not stupid - he knows he'd lose and runs frit from Newark!' But . Mr Farage claimed that putting his own name forward for the seat would . cause a 'distraction' from the party's bid to win the European . Parliament elections on May 22. Labour leader Ed Miliband has been egged several times, including on this visit to Southampton Tory leader David Cameron was hit with an egg by a student during a visit to Cornwall College in Saltash in 2010 . In 2001 Labour's John Prescott threw a punch at protester Chris Evans after he hurled an egg at the then-Deputy Prime Minister . Being egged is an occupational hazard for politicians. David Cameron was targeted during a visit to Cornwall College in Saltash in 2010. And Labour leader Ed Miliband has been egged several times, including in south London in August last year and in Southampton in May 2012. In August 2011, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was hit with an egg containing blue paint. The most famous political egging is probably the moment Labour's John Prescott threw a punch at protestor Chris Evans on a visit to Rhyl in north Wales in 2001.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Shamed: Max Clifford, pictured after being convicted of eight indecent assaults, allegedly carried around a book of celebrity sleaze . Max Clifford protected himself from scrutiny with a 'little brown book' crammed with damaging allegations against celebrities - at the same time he was indecently assaulting teenage girls, it has been claimed. The shamed PR guru would allegedly use the book as 'insurance' and proof that he was untouchable, according to a former detective who passed information to the Operation Yewtree investigation into Clifford's offending. Mark Williams-Thomas, a former police investigator and crime expert, presented a documentary on paeodphile Jimmy Savile, which led to him being contacted with claims about Clifford,  which included details of the book. The book is said to contain details of celebrities who had affairs, and a claim from a teenage rent boy that a very high-profile pop star had paid him for sex. The claims were said to relate to his own celebrity clients, and were harvested through the 1980s and 1990s. Mr Williams-Thomas said: 'He kept it as insurance to protect himself. The more Max knew, the more he could protect himself.' Clifford, 71, was jailed for eight years on Friday for eight years after being convicted of a string of sex offences. A jury at Southwark Crown Court found him guilty of eight indecent assaults, which took place on four victims aged 15 to 19 between the years of 1978 and 1984. The court heard how Max thought he was 'untouchable' because of his celebrity links, which allowed him to intimidate his victims into staying silent for more than 30 years. It was heard that after assaulting the women he would warn that nobody would believe them if they spoke out. Scroll down for video . Surrounded: Sharon said coming face-to-face with the publicist in court evoked not hatred, but pity . Indecent assaults: Clifford's crimes took place between 1978 and 1984. He is pictured left in the mid 1970s and right in 1989 . Sentencing, Judge Anthony Leonard QC said: 'I judge that the reason why they were not brought to light sooner is because of your own dominant character and your position in the world of entertainment.' 'Your victims thought you were untouchable, something I judge that you, too, believed and traded upon'. Mr Williams-Thomas said that he leaned of the book - said to have given the influential agent the same power over celebrities he exerted on his victims - because an alleged victim had been drafted in by a panicked Clifford to track it down after he misplaced it. Speaking to The Sun, Mr Williams-Thomas said: 'One woman who I interviewed explained the power and control that Max had over her and so many other people. Investigation: Detectives were last night investigating new sex abuse claims against Clifford. Above, the British publicist poses for the media as he arrives at Southwark Crown Court in London for sentencing on Friday . 'She described an occasion when she was out with him and he lost his book containing secrets - a ""little brown book"" of scandalous evidence against stars.' He said the woman was eventually able to track the book down in a London restaurant the same night it was lost - in the early 1980s - bringing 'palpable' relief to Clifford. During Clifford's trial the jury heard how he would intimidate his young victims with his showbusiness connections, and pressure them into performing sex acts on him by telling them he could win them parts in films. One victim, who spoke to the Daily Mail under the psueodnym Cathy Johnson, said that she met Clifford on holiday, and he invited her into his office with acting and modelling opportunities. Groomed: One of Clifford's victims, pictured above, spoke out under the pseudonym Cathy Johnson . Victim: Sharon Elliott, pictured left yesterday, waived her anonymity to tell of how she was abused by Clifford. She is pictured right in 1984 around the time of the attack . There he forced her to strip for him. He later charmed her parents into letting him drive her around London, where he would park in dark allies and force her into sex acts. Another victim, Sharon Elliott, waived her anonymity to tell the Mail on Sunday how Clifford offered her the chance to become a Bond Girl. He then led her into a toilet cubicle in a London night club and forced her to perform a sex act on him. In the wake of his trial, even more women are said to have opened up to police about further assaults by Clifford - which could result in him facing further charges. Police sources have said that as many as ten new victims have come forward while the trial was in progress and after his conviction, and that Operation Yewtree investigators were 'inundated'. One source told the Sunday Mirror: 'More women are coming forward all of the time. The total could easily pass double figures'. The Metropolitan Police told MailOnline: 'New information has been received, which Operation Yewtree investigators are currently assessing'.","Clifford, 71, allegedly carried the book - full of secrets - with him in the 1980s .

"By . John Greechan . They came from near and far, the great and good of football, to pay tribute to one of their own. But this was no occasion for revelling in tales of past sporting glories. Instead, and quite rightly, the funeral service for Sandy Jardine concentrated more on the man than on the footballer. John Greig was mentioned as an enduring friend first, team-mate second. The recollection of a young Jardine spending his first Rangers bonus on a fur coat for his mum, meanwhile, said more than any list of medals ever could. On a bitterly cold morning in Edinburgh, hundreds gathered at Mortonhall Crematorium not because Sandy Jardine was famous as a Rangers, Hearts and Scotland player. They turned out to show their respect for a man who, as the Reverend John Shields made clear, valued ‘love, loyalty and respect’ above even the most glittering prizes on offer during his career. Honour: Sir Alex Ferguson and Walter Smith arriving to pay their respects at Jardine's funeral . Tribute: Scottish rock singer Rod Stewart sent a touching note to the former Rangers fullback . Past and present: Rangers legend Ally Dawson (left) and current club captain Lee McCulloch arrive . Greig, the . Greatest Ever Ranger, was one of the pall bearers on a day that saw . some of the Scottish game’s most well-respected figures in attendance. Sir Alex Ferguson chatted with Walter Smith and Willie Henderson, Celtic . were represented by Peter Lawwell, Billy McNeil and Bertie Auld, while . neither Gordon McQueen nor Joe Jordan would have even considered missing . the occasion. Of . course, plenty more of Jardine’s old team-mates from the class of ’72 . were in attendance, the Cup Winners’ Cup victory that bound them . together in the 40 odd years since only a small part of the affection . they felt for Sandy. Hearts . were represented, too, in the shape of current boss Gary Locke and . former manager Craig Levein, while the entire Rangers first team – . including coach Ian Durrant, on crutches – arrived together. Jardine’s . love of music was evident even before the hearse arrived, with speakers . outside the main chapel relaying recordings of My Girl and This Old Heart of Mine, while he was borne into the chapel to How Sweet It Is To Be Loved By You. The . service itself began with an apology of sorts, the Reverend Shields . explaining that he would be using both of Jardine’s Christian names – he . was Sandy to the outside world but always Billy to the family – . throughout. The . minister having begged forgiveness for any confusion caused, he . proceeded with a ceremony that was quietly religious, although the . volume did rise as mourners joined in a rendition of The Old Rugged . Cross. Club men: Rangers manager Ally McCoist (left) and former assistant manager Archie Knox also attended . Respects: Rangers legend Colin Jackson arrives ahead of the funeral of former team-mate . One mourner outside Mortonhall Crematorium holds the order of service ahead of the funeral . The . eulogy was delivered by best friend Davie Ross, who said: ‘The three . things that Billy loved most were football, friends and family. ‘We all know about Billy, or should I say Sandy, Jardine’s reputation as a legendary Rangers and Scotland footballer. ‘To . all football fans, no matter where their allegiances lay, he will be . remembered as one of the greatest ambassadors of the game. ‘He was a wonderful player who played to win but played fairly, and bore no grudges once the final whistle was blown. ‘To . the legions of Rangers fans, he will quite rightly be remembered not . only for his football ability but as someone who served the club with . great distinction and loyalty – particularly through the recent . financial crisis. ‘If you read a newspaper in the past week, you’ll all know the statistics about caps and trophies won. ‘As Ally McCoist said, though, I’d rather talk about the man than the footballer. ‘So it’s Billy, the family friend. Not Sandy, the Rangers legend.’ Legend: Jardine was a Rangers hero and won 38 caps for Scotland between 1971 and 1980 . Grief: Rangers fans laid hundreds of fans in tribute to their former defender. Mention . was made of Jardine’s childhood in Edinburgh, his love of cards and . golf, and his refusal ever to forget his old pals when he hit the big . time. To . illustrate just how grounded the young up-and-coming footballer was at a . time when his head might easily have been turned, Ross – who recalled . Jardine’s daily commute to training in the company of Greig, a firm . friend until the end – revealed: ‘He signed for Rangers in 1964 and his . first bonus was paid in cash. ‘Billy . sat on the bus tightly holding his pocket, because he was terrified . that he might lose the money. But he took it home and bought his mum a . fur coat.’ There . were laughs, as Jardine would have wanted, with one tale about he and . former Rangers chief executive Martin Bain getting confused between . sinks and urinals in a restaurant at the top of the Eifel Tower . thankfully short on detail. Jardine . did a great deal with his close-knit group of childhood pals, including . travelling to watch the Masters a few years ago – and scoring tickets . for the 100 metres final at the London Olympics. Ross, . with a nod to his old friend’s renowned turn of pace, recalled: ‘When . Usain Bolt flashed past the winning post, Billy announced that, 45 years . ago, he would have given him a run for his money. Aye.’ Tragedy: Former Rangers Chief Executive Martin Bain struggles to hold back tears . Emotional: McCoist during a minutes silence for Jardine before Rangers' last match . Thanks . were offered to the many friends who had visited with Jardine in the . few months since he was told that the cancer he’d battled so bravely . since November 2012 was now terminal. And, . of course, much of the focus was on his wife, Shona, children Steven . and Nicola, as well as the seven grandchildren who brought him so much . joy on those days out at East Links Country Park. Ross, . who paid tribute to the NHS and the Macmillan Cancer Support staff who . helped his friend, added: ‘Billy’s strength of character and courage was . beyond belief. Never once did we hear him complain or ask: “Why me?” ‘In . all the years I’ve known him, Billy was never one to talk about . himself. He’ s got two ears and one mouth – and he uses them in that . proportion. ‘We should make sure that his memory lives on in all of us. He was simply the best.’ Shields, . who spoke movingly about Jardine’s integrity, honesty, tolerance and . remarkable commitment to self-discipline, treating his body like a . temple, followed readings and poems by leading mourners in the singing . of My Way. The . order of service for the day summed up the collective feeling of so . many present, a picture of Jardine on the back accompanied by the words: . ‘A legend in his lifetime. In our hearts forever.’","Former United boss joins Rangers stars to pay his respects .

Above, Byron is pictured aged 11, weighing 16-and-a-half stone (left) and at 17 years old (right) Six years on, he has lost five stone - and has even become one of Britain's young weightlifting champions. Byron, now 17, said his incredible transformation began after he visited Holyhead and Anglesey Weightlifting and FItness Centre. He said he found pumping iron difficult at first because of his small size - but thanks to the dedication of club owner, Ray Williams, he decided to keep training. 'I was desperately overweight and not very happy,' said Byron. 'A lot of it was down to large portions and bad choices. I would go to the park with my friends to play football, but wouldn't be able to play for very long because I would be out of breath. Pumping iron: Byron said his incredible transformation had begun after he visited Holyhead and Anglesey Weightlifting in Holyhead, North Wales. He said he found pumping iron difficult at first because of his small size . 'I didn't have a lot of confidence, but then some friends encouraged me to go along to the weightlifting club. 'I started to take it seriously and managed to lose a lot of weight in just over 18 months. It completely transformed my life.'

'I really like being able to encourage the other young people to lead healthy lives,' said Byron, whose diet has completely changed over the past six years. 'I can show them what can be achieved. My best piece of advice would be that everything is achievable if you put your mind to it. 'If you are consistent and keep going, you can do anything. It does take dedication, but it can be done.' Following his amazing weight loss, Byron was highlighted by the National Lottery's Good Causes scheme as an inspirational young person. He is now set to feature in a new film that focuses on young people who teach, volunteer and 'make a difference' at lottery-funded projects across Wales. Jackie O'Sullivan, director of the National Lottery Good Causes, said: 'These young people are just a few of many everyday heroes using National Lottery funding to change lives across Wales.'

"By . Joe Bernstein . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers thinks top players from around Europe are keen to join the Anfield revolution because of the thrilling way they have qualified for the Champions League. Rodgers will be given £60million to spend by the club owners and has been linked with a number of targets, including Ukraine winger Yevhen Konoplyanka, Argentina’s World Cup left-back Marcos Rojo and emerging England talents Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and Steven Caulker. Last year, Rodgers was devastated to miss out on £25m playmaker Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who chose Borussia Dortmund over Merseyside. VIDEO Scroll down to see some of Liverpool's targets in action . Red revolution: Top players want to come to Liverpool now, claims manager Brendan Rodgers . Saints alive! England hopefuls Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw (R) are on Liverpool's radar this summer . But Rodgers, who takes his side to Crystal Palace tomorrow night aiming to bounce back after losing at home to Chelsea last weekend, is more hopeful of landing players this time, with 96 goals in the Premier League and getting the best out of Luis Suarez. ‘We had the experience last summer when players respected what we were developing at the club but wanted to play at the top level [the Champions League],’ said Rodgers. ‘I suspect this summer will be a totally different proposition. Enter the dragon? Liverpool's hopes of signing Steven Caulker increased after Cardiff were relegated . Red army: Ukraine winger Yevhen Konoplyanka (L) and Argentina's  Marcos Rojo are other transfer targets . ‘Our style of football is recognised. We have a way of working and a way of playing that in particular top players want to play in, a creative attacking team that wins. Hopefully it prepares us for bringing in this calibre of player and sets us up to have a real crack at the competition.’ Rodgers wants to sign at least new five players to help cope with the Premier League and Champions League.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A vinyl cat has become an internet sensation after she was caught on video manipulating a record playing like a DJ. Two-year-old Furby was enticed to a record player by the sounds of Bob Marley's Is This Love, which her owner James Corballis, 27, had put on at home in Galway, Ireland. And once she had come face-to-face with the spinning record, she decided to take matters into her own paws by moving the record back and forth. Scroll down for video . Music whizz: Furby, a two-year-old cat, was filmed by her owner 'mixing' a Bob Marley record on his vinyl player . She speeds the track up, slows it down as well as seeming to 'scratch' the record in the manner of professional DJs. However, her curiosity quickly gets the better of Furby, and she climbs onto the player, knocking the needle off and leaving her spinning round on the player. Mr Corballis managed to capture the moment on his phone's camera. After uploading being uploaded to YouTube the video amassed more than a million hits over three days. Choosing her moment: Furby had never seen the record player before when she was tempted over by the sounds of Is This Love . On top of the situation: Furby later abandoned her musical aspirations and took a ride on the record player . Spin me right round: Furby unfortunately knocked the needle away when she climbed on board, but has maintained a keen interest in music . Mr Corballis said: 'I was just sitting around at home one day and put on a Bob Marley record. Furby had never seen the record player in action before and took an immediate interest in it. 'The video was a complete one off and there will be no attempt to do a follow up. I believe the best viral videos happen by chance.' 'After the video went viral, I played the music in the house regularly. She would run over to the computer every time she heard Is This Love so it's safe to say she's a big Bob Marley fan.'","Furby, aged two, from Galway, Ireland, was tempted by Bob Marley song .

"By . David Cameron . So . many of us have been there. You're in the waiting room as your child . goes into the operating theatre. The minutes feel like hours, and the . hours go on for ever. As . you wait for news, a nurse comes to put your mind at rest, reassuring . you that your child is in the best possible hands. And in that moment . you feel overwhelming gratitude towards our National Health Service. I . have felt that gratitude so many times. So it was no surprise to me . that when a poll last year asked people which institution made them . most proud to be British, the NHS came top. David Cameron pictured with his late son Ivan at their country home in May 2004 . It . really is the most precious institution in our country, one of the . greatest achievements of the 20th century - and vitally important to my . family and to every family  in Britain. But . when we talk about our great affection for the NHS, we're not talking . about the surgeries or the hospitals or the facilities: we're talking . about the people - the 1.7 million health workers who treat a staggering . one million of us every 36 hours. These . people are our superstars in scrubs, our angels in aprons, and the . Health Hero Awards give us a fantastic opportunity to thank them for . everything they do. And there are three reasons why I think it is so important that we do so. First, it allows us to show those individuals who go far beyond the call of duty that we are grateful to them. It . allows us to highlight the things that cannot be measured in statistics . or graphs or league tables - whether it's a doctor's determination to . get to the bottom of a mystery illness; a paramedic's quick thinking in a . life-or-death situation; or a volunteer's kind words in a patient's . lowest moments. Last year, I was asked to nominate my family's health heroes. It was hard to pick  just two. The . first I chose was  Dr Mando Watson, the wonderful consultant . paediatrician who looked after our dear son Ivan. She never gave up on . Ivan; she always had that desire to go the extra mile. And we will never . forget how much she did for our family. My . second nominee was Ivan's community nurse, Tara Kerr-Elliott. She did . everything she could to get us what we needed, including a social . worker, respite care, even a school for Ivan. Her support was remarkable . and invaluable. We owe her and Dr Watson a great deal. Second, . the awards allow us to demonstrate what our health service is really all . about. Often it can feel like the only stories about the NHS in the . newspapers are negative ones. But we need to show that the wrongdoing of . a few will never detract from the everyday selflessness of the many. There . are so many people willing to do whatever they can to help their . patients - people such as Dr Ronan Moran, last year's Health Hero . winner. This . GP visited his terminally-ill patient every evening after work, . supporting him and the family through the toughest of times.  He was . nominated for the award by the man's wife, who was astounded at Dr . Moran's quiet and personal dedication to their family. I . got to discuss this story, and others from his 30-year career, when I . welcomed Dr Moran and the other Health Hero finalists to Downing Street . last year. Third, . these awards give us a chance to reaffirm our commitment to the health . service, whose budget we have been able to safeguard thanks to the tough . decisions we've taken to rebalance our economy. I . have always thought of the NHS as an expression of our values as a . nation - a  symbol of collective will, of social solidarity. And . while there is today enormous pressure on the services - with an ageing . population, an epidemic of long-term conditions and growing demand for . new drugs and technologies - our healthcare workers have continued to . meet the challenges with typical British resilience and resolve. So . I would urge everyone to nominate their own Health Hero this year. And I . look forward to joining the Daily Mail in celebrating more stories of . care and compassion when the nominees and winner are announced.","Daily Mail launches Health Hero Awards, with Boots and ITV's This Morning .

"By . Associated Press . Updated: . 06:29 EST, 6 March 2012 . Attorney General Eric Holder says the Constitution allows the government to assassinate US citizens living abroad if they are plotting terrorist attacks against other Americans. Holder's comments broke the administration's silence on the legal justifications for its decision to kill American-born al-Qaida operative Anwar al-Awlaki five months ago in Yemen. In a speech at Northwestern University law school in Chicago, he described al-Awlaki as concocting plans to kill Americans but he never explicitly acknowledged the administration responded by targeting the cleric for death. Justified: Attorney General Eric Holder's comments were the first public legal justification for the killing of American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki . Instead the attorney general outlined a three-part test for determining when a targeted killing against a US citizen is legal. First, he said, the government must determine after careful review that the citizen poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the US. Second, capture is not feasible. Finally, the killing would be consistent with laws of war. The Obama administration has refused to release the Justice Department legal opinion on al-Awlaki's killing under the Freedom of Information Act and is in court opposing efforts to have it made public. 'We must take steps to stop them in full . accordance with the Constitution. In this hour of danger, we simply . cannot afford to wait until deadly plans are carried out -- and we will . not.' Attorney General Eric Holder . Responding to criticism from civil libertarians, Holder flatly rejected the suggestion that the Constitution's due process protections require the president to get permission from a federal court before taking lethal action. 'The unfortunate reality is that our nation will likely continue to face terrorist threats that at times originate with our own citizens,' Holder told a packed Thorne Auditorium, where 700 seats were filled with law students, who were taking notes on their laptops, and Chicago-based federal prosecutors and other observers. 'When such individuals take up arms against this country and join al-Qaida in plotting attacks designed to kill their fellow Americans there may be only one realistic and appropriate response,' the attorney general continued. 'We must take steps to stop them in full accordance with the Constitution. In this hour of danger, we simply cannot afford to wait until deadly plans are carried out -- and we will not.' Assassinated: Anwar al-Awlaki was an American-born Muslim cleric who worked for al-Qaeda. He was killed in a drone strike in September . Al-Awlaki's killing in a joint CIA-US military drone strike on a convoy in Yemen sparked a public debate over whether the president should have the authority to kill an American without a conviction and despite an executive order banning assassinations - which Holder called a 'loaded term' that doesn't apply in this case. Until now the Obama administration has said very little about it publicly as administration officials have debated how much to reveal in response to the criticism. The day that al-Awlaki was killed, President Barack Obama said his death was 'a major blow to al-Qaida's most active operational affiliate' and 'another significant milestone in the broader effort to defeat al-Qaida.' 'The Constitution guarantees due process, not judicial process.'Attorney General Eric Holder . But he did not acknowledge publicly that the United States was responsible for the drone attack, which was confirmed by counterterrorism officials. Al-Awlaki was a cleric who was born in New Mexico and once preached at an Islamic center in Falls Church, Virginia. His sermons in English are posted all over the Internet and his name has been associated with several attempted terrorist attacks. The Justice Department has said that a Nigerian man who tried to blow up an international flight on Christmas 2009 told FBI agents that his mission was approved after a three-day visit with al-Awlaki. Obama administration officials told The Associated Press that Obama approved al-Awlaki's killing in April 2010, when he became the first American placed on the CIA 'kill or capture' list. 'Any decision to use lethal force against a United States citizen -- even one intent on murdering Americans and who has become an operational leader of al-Qaida in a foreign land - is among the gravest that government leaders can face,' Holder said. 'The American people can be -- and deserve to be -- assured that actions taken in their defense are consistent with their values and their laws.' American citizen: Al-Awlaki was born in New Mexico and served as Imam at a mosque in Falls Church, Virginia . Al-Awlaki's father sued to try to stop the government from killing his son, arguing he had to be afforded the constitutional right to due process. But US District Judge John Bates in Washington refused to intervene in al-Awlaki's case because he said the courts do not have the authority to review the president's military decisions. Holder pointed out that decision in his speech. 'The Constitution guarantees due process, not judicial process,' Holder said. At least three recently filed lawsuits have sought to force the Obama administration to publicly release its legal justification for the attack, contained in a secret Justice Department memo. The Associated Press also filed a FOIA request for the memo, which was denied. The AP has appealed. Hina Shamsi with the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups suing for the memo, said if Holder can discuss the targeted killing program publicly, the memo should be released and its position defended in court. 'Few things are as dangerous to American liberty as the proposition that the government should be able to kill citizens anywhere in the world on the basis of legal standards and evidence that are never submitted to a court, either before or after the fact,' Shamsi said. 'Anyone willing to trust President Obama with the power to secretly declare an American citizen an enemy of the state and order his extrajudicial killing should ask whether they would be willing to trust the next president with that dangerous power.' University of Notre Dame international law expert Mary Ellen O'Connell also said the memo should be released to reveal more about the administration's position. 'From what we know so far, the memo is highly reminiscent of the torture memos written during the Bush administration, in which irrelevant US cases and statutes are cited in order to give the CIA a green light,' she said. 'The relevant international law does not permit targeted killing far from battle zones.' Holder said it's 'not a novel concept' to target enemy leaders for death, pointing out such attacks were made against al-Qaida's chief Osama bin Laden and during World War II, including shooting down an aircraft specifically because it was carrying Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, leader of the attack on Pearl Harbor. He said Congress has given the president authorization to use lethal methods under a resolution passed a week after the September 11 terrorist attacks that authorizes the use of all necessary force to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States. He said that authority was not limited to battlefields in Afghanistan, because the nation faces a threat of terrorism from 'a stateless enemy, prone to shifting operations from country to country.' 'It is preferable to capture suspected terrorists where feasible -- among other reasons, so that we can gather valuable intelligence from them,' Holder said. 'But we must also recognize that there are instances where our government has the clear authority - and, I would argue, the responsibility - to defend the United States through the appropriate and lawful use of lethal force.' Holder said that doesn't mean the administration can use military force whenever it wants and that it must respect other nations' sovereignty before acting alone on their soil. 'But the use of force in foreign territory would be consistent with these international legal principles if conducted, for example, with the consent of the nation involved or after a determination that the nation is unable or unwilling to deal effectively with a threat to the United States,' he said.","First legal justification for killing American al-Qaida leader Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen .

"By . Bianca London . He's a key Manchester City player and England's first-choice goalkeeper so footballer Joe Hart knows a thing or two about success. That's exactly why Hugo Boss has snapped up the successful young athlete to front their new scent, which is inspired by 'man’s determination and drive for success.' While the 27-year-old is known for keeping the most clean sheets in the Premier League's season - that's preventing the opponents scoring any goals during an entire match - he also looks set to take the modelling world by storm, if this new campaign is anything to go by. New face: England goalkeeper Joe Hart, who has become something of a heartthrob on the pitch, has been unveiled as the face of Hugo Boss' new fragrance . Speaking to MailOnline about becoming the face of Boss Bottled Unlimited, he said: 'I spend a lot of the time not smelling good on the pitch so this campaign is great because, after all, I do like to smell good and this scent is really invigorating and aromatic. 'As for the modelling, it definitely isn't something I am used to but I got to wear some really cool clothes.' Joe, who describes his personal style as 'comfy, fresh, sharp and tidy,'  joins Hollywood heartthrob Ryan Reynolds as a face of the beauty giant. 'He's a cool guy and luckily I'm not filling his shoes,' he said. Footballer turned model: Joe, who describes his personal style as 'comfy, fresh, sharp and tidy' is the face of Boss Bottled Unlimited and looks dapper in the campaign imagery . While his fellow footballers are more assiduous when it comes to grooming (here's looking at you, David Beckham), Joe maintains that his beauty regime is very simple. 'I do like to look after myself but I promise my hair colour is natural!' he said of those famous blonde locks. As a master of his profession, Joe shared his views on success, how to achieve it and how to sustain it. He said: 'To succeed, you have to be committed to what you do and love what you do. I’m really passionate about my job and give it my all. 'I’m so lucky that I’ve always had a team around me that have helped me get to where I am today - family, friends, and coaches. You have to take every opportunity possible and you just have to keep going, keep improving and constantly moving forward.' Speaking about his diet and getting in shape for summer, Joe explained that, while he has a healthy eating regime, he is partial to the odd treat. 'I eat well and at the right times and obviously do loads of exercise and training, which I really enjoy. 'My diet is high protein and I avoid carbs in the evening but I don't neglect food, it's my friend. 'I have treat days and anything goes, I'll pretty much eat anything and everything,' he said. Behind the scenes: Joe shows off some football skills as he prepares to pose for his new campaign . When he isn't training or impressing on the pitch, Joe loves to play even more sport. 'I love chilling out with friends and family, I am obviously a football fan and love to watch and play sports such as golf and cricket.' But you won't catch him playing FIFA or football manager in his downtime. 'I am rubbish at football games,' he laughs. 'Level one is too hard for me!.'

"By . Erica Camus . Back in control: Amelia Adams has learned to overcome her panic attacks through the therapy . Amelia Adams has suffered from anxiety since she was a teenager – a constant worry that can leave her light-headed, shaky and exhausted. Now aged 22, she had her first panic attack at 17 and has spent years trying to overcome her overwhelming feelings. Today, after two courses of cognitive behavioural therapy – the standard NHS treatment for anxiety – proved ineffective, Amelia is finally being helped by a new type of psychological intervention: compassion focused therapy (CFT). Inspired by Buddhism, CFT was  conceived 30 years ago by Professor Paul Gilbert, a clinical psychologist for Derbyshire Health Care Foundation Trust. It is now being offered as a therapy option at a number of NHS hospitals. Sessions can be either for individuals and last about 50 minutes, or be 90-minute group discussions. ‘It’s similar to CBT, which works by helping patients to consider their negative thoughts and come to more realistic alternative views,’ says Prof Gilbert. ‘But while CBT focuses on changing behaviour in a neutral, practical way – such as using timesheets to plan the day more productively –  in CFT the focus is more on being kind to yourself.’ Sessions have three elements: encouraging patients to do activities or make changes that are kind to themselves, such as writing to a friend; helping them focus on seeing the good in other people and their own lives rather than the negative aspects; and getting the patient  to speak out loud to themselves in a kind, warm tone. ‘Our brains naturally focus on the negative,’ says Prof Gilbert. ‘For example, if we go shopping and in nine shops the assistants are extremely helpful but in one shop the assistant is very rude, we focus on the latter and lose sight of the positive experiences. ‘Deliberately training our attention to notice kindness in others can be very helpful, which CFT does.’ Through tackling the self-criticism and replacing it with kindness, patients then judge themselves and their lives less harshly and therefore feel happier. ‘By helping people feel compassion, we believe you can create  a positive physiological change in your body – just like imagining a delicious dinner will stimulate saliva and appetite,’ continues Prof Gilbert. ‘CBT is primarily focused on thinking and behaviour change but CFT looks at the emotion behind people’s thoughts.’ Kind words: In compassion focused therapy (CFT) the focus is on being kind to yourself and encouraging positivity . CFT therapist Chris Irons adds: ‘It is a relatively new therapy but we are working hard to show that this approach has something important to offer. ‘So far there has been one successful randomised control trial of CFT which found a reduction in symptoms in patients with depression.’ Up to 30 per cent of the population suffers anxiety at any one time.  Last month a report from the  Office for National Statistics said young women are more anxious than young men, while growing numbers of middle-aged women  are suffering chronic anxiety – females aged over 60 are the most likely group to need hospital treatment for the condition. ‘My anxiety started on a night  out with friends when we were on holiday in Greece,’ says Amelia, a personal assistant from Surrey. ‘I felt suddenly overwhelmed by panic and I ended up walking back to our apartment alone and then  was up all night in absolute bits trying to calm myself down. ‘I ended up getting in the shower every hour to cool down and I had no one to speak to, which made it ten times worse. ‘It was so terrifying I flew home early from the holiday, and afterwards I was always really nervous that I’d have another panic attack somewhere far from home with nobody there to comfort me.’ Following that trip, Amelia’s attacks became regular, happening once or twice a month. They lasted about ten minutes each time and left her upset and exhausted. Her GP referred her for two courses of CBT, but the anxiety persisted. ‘It sounds silly, but I couldn’t stop worrying about my cat during the day – thoughts about her getting run over. Whatever the trigger, I feel light-headed and shaky, my stomach churns and for a moment it’s a bit like I’m having a panic attack. It’s really upsetting.’ Amelia heard about CFT through her volunteer work at a mental health charity and, hoping to eliminate her anxiety, she booked a course of six sessions with a private therapist. Amelia says: ‘CBT had helped with my generalised anxiety but I preferred CFT because it involved more talking and delving into things like my childhood. I’m usually quite hard on myself so it’s taught me to be kinder, which has really helped. ‘Now when I’m on my own and start to feel panic, I am more gentle on myself, so instead of panicking  I sort of talk myself round with comfort. I now know that the anxiety I feel is not my fault. For the first time in years I have found a way to calm down rather than wind myself up still further.’","Amelia Adams, 22, from Surrey has suffered from anxiety since her teens .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Model Cara Delevingne is toning down her party lifestyle and toning up instead – with the help of the Prime Minister’s personal trainer. Cara, a catwalk favourite for luxury brands including Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana and Chanel, has become a member of the exclusive women’s-only gym Grace Belgravia in Central London. Under the guidance of trainers led by celebrity fitness consultant Matt Roberts – the man who has helped Naomi Campbell and David and Samantha Cameron – Cara is lifting weights to help create long, lean muscles. Fitness friends: Cara Delevingne and fellow supermodel Suki Waterhouse are both members of the exclusive Grace Belgravia gym in London . She has been seen working out in the gym a couple of times a week, often with fellow model Suki Waterhouse. The price of fitness does not come cheap, however – annual membership at Grace Belgravia costs up to £5,500, plus a £2,000 joining fee.  But given that Cara will soon be seen in her underwear for the Victoria’s Secret UK show, she may feel it money well spent. Almost a third of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) sufferers are intolerant of fructose, according to a new study.  Fructose is a naturally occurring sugar found in fruit, vegetables and honey, and is often added to soft drinks and processed foods. The study from Rouen University Hospital in France shows it appears to be a risk factor for IBS and other gastrointestinal disorders, which affect at least ten per cent of the population in Europe. Dr Charles Murray, consultant gastroenterologist at London’s Royal Free Hospital, says: ‘A low-fructose diet is definitely worth considering in IBS patients.’ Talk about power walk:  Celebrity fitness coach Matt Roberts Prime Minister David Cameron . Beware . the temptation of crisps and biscuits – it’s not only their flavour . that lures you to eat more but also their crunch. The texture of food is . just as important to our eating habits as taste, smell and look, . according to researchers at the University of South Florida. They . studied the links between how food feels when chewing and how much . people consume. The results showed that we perceive food that is harder . and rough-textured to contain fewer calories, so we may be fooled into . consuming more. Rosy hips? Rosehip extracts has been proven to help with arthritis symptoms in the past . An extract from the humble rosehip is helping to ease pain for millions of arthritis sufferers. New Danish research, presented at the Osteoarthritis Research Society International World Congress, has added to a growing body of evidence showing that GOPO – a compound derived from rosehip – reduces joint pain, improves mobility and reduces inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA). OA affects more than 600 million people worldwide, and the latest guidelines advise against the long-term use of paracetamol. ‘GOPO Joint Health capsules could now be used as a first-line treatment for a three-month trial period in patients with OA,’ says Dr John Dickson, co-founder of the Primary Care Rheumatology Society. Simply looking in a bedside mirror has been found to be an effective way to help calm patients who feel disorientated or agitated after surgery. Up to half of those aged 65 and over are estimated to experience post-operative delirium (POD). Bright lights coupled with unfamiliar surroundings and the trauma of anaesthesia and surgery combine to trigger the condition. Giving patients who seem disorientated a hand-held mirror is a method long used by nurses – but evidence that it helps induce calm has always been anecdotal. Now doctors at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge have installed bedside mirrors in intensive care units in the first trial to formally study how and why it might work. Unlikely as it sounds, tomatoes  may . be a major cause of unwanted body odour.  Dr Charles Stewart, a retired . pharmaceutical physician in Northern Ireland, claims that eating just . two tomatoes can lead to the unpleasant smell that lasts for up to a . week. Dr Stewart’s own . situation prompted him to investigate. ‘I was aware of my underarm odour . one hot summer seven years ago, when colleagues routinely opened . windows in my presence,’ he says. ‘I stopped eating tomatoes and have . not been troubled by the smell since.’ Tomato hairs contain a pungent oil that helps defend the plant against insect attack – and this smells like underarm odour.","Cara Delevingne is tonight down the partying to tone up .

Her parents say they are living with a ‘ticking time bomb’ because they never know when too much excitement or over exertion could induce a fit. Neve Dandy (pictured with her mother, Rebecca), five, has a rare and severe form of epilepsy which means something as simple as a giggling fit could trigger a life-threatening seizure . Neve rarely attends play dates and can never go swimming with her brother because the risk of over-excitement and infection is too high. Neve’s condition, called Dravet syndrome, has seen her have seizures lasting up to one-and-a-half-hours and up to 200 electric shock type fits a day. She is also at high risk of SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy) and sleeps with a monitor that warns her parents when her heart rate or oxygen levels change. Her mother, Rebecca, said: ‘Neve is probably the happiest little girl you will ever come across. She is always smiling and giggling. ‘But it can feel like you are looking after a ticking time bomb as caring for a child with Dravet is very stressful. ‘You never know when the next life-threatening seizure will come, or if a little one will turn into a big one. I feel incredibly grateful every morning when she wakes up and says hello. Neve's condition is controlled by a special diet which sees her having to be given syringes full of oil and water . Bright light and wind can also trigger Neve's seizures so she has to wear sunglasses when she goes out and she has to stay inside when it is windy . ‘We really do have to put a limit on excitement. And even a common virus could lead to a increase in her temperature, which can cause a seizure. ‘It’s quite sad really, always having to tell your child, “don’t laugh too much” or “don’t giggle too much” and telling our son not to make her laugh. It’s really tough.’ Mrs Dandy, and her husband Graham, 40, first noticed something was wrong with Neve when she was just four months old. Dravet Syndrome is a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy that begins in infancy. Children with Dravets tend to have normal development as babies but development starts to plateau when they are in their second year of life. Individuals with Dravet syndrome face a higher incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP). They often also experience other conditions including developmental delays, sleeping difficulties, chronic infections and difficulty feeding. There is currently no cure and treatment options are limited - they mainly involve using anti-epilepsy drugs to treat the seizures. Little is known about the long term prognosis of people with Dravet Syndrome. As they attended a christening she began to shake in her father’s arms, and when it finally stopped after 25 minutes, she was rushed to hospital. Neve spent a week in hospital where doctors tested her for a number of different conditions, including meningitis. But the baffled medics were unable to come up with any explanations, and Neve suffered dozens of other fits before they finally gave her the diagnosis when she was 18 months old. Dravet syndrome is a rare form epilepsy, with figures suggesting that of every 500 children diagnosed with epilepsy, only two are likely to have the condition. As it affects many different parts of the brain, there are a number of different triggers for seizures, as opposed to other epilepsies that might only affect one site. Sufferers can therefore not undergo brain surgery. A slight change in body temperature due to illness can cause seizures as can overexcitement and overexertion. Neve also has photosensitive epilepsy so anything that can give a strobe effect, such as screens, light through leaves or through a net, can cause a seizure. Sufferers never grow out of Dravet syndrome and most will need care their entire lives. Many also may be on the autism spectrum and be developmentally delayed - often having mobility issues, behavioural problems and difficulty sleeping. Mrs Dandy, from Windsor, Berkshire, said: ‘Dravet syndrome affects every aspect of Neve’s life, but still she smiles. ‘She is very environmentally sensitive, the wind causes seizures so if it is a windy day she can’t go outside. She has to wear sunglasses whenever she is outside too. Neve had her first seizure when she was four months old but was not diagnosed until she was 18 months old . Neve is unlikely ever to grow out of her epilepsy and her parents say she is like a 'ticking time bomb' ‘She can’t control her body temperature, so I can’t put her in tights for example. She doesn’t tend to go outside over the winter at all. In the summer the heat is even more of a risk. ‘We went through a stage where time on the trampoline would cause seizures or the sunlight through leaves.’ Mr and Mrs Dandy have to be particularly careful when she is around other children or doing fun activities. ‘We are always very careful about germs as even common childhood illnesses can lead to severe seizures. We don’t take her to public swimming baths or soft play centres for this reason,’ said Mrs Dandy. ‘When we do take her swimming somewhere private she goes in for 10 minutes and then it’s out again because she loves it so much that she gets overexcited.’ But the schoolgirl - who was taught at home for two years to avoid infection from other children - is finally getting a taste of normal life, thanks to a special diet. Mrs Dandy said: 'You never know when the next life-threatening seizure will come, or if a little one will turn into a big one. I feel incredibly grateful every morning when she wakes up and says hello' The eating plan has helped keep her seizures under control. Neve was in and out of hospital and had four stays in intensive care over 18 months until she started on the ketogenic diet. The diet alters the body’s chemistry by convincing it that it is starving and is formulated to sustain the state of ketosis within the body. Forcing the body into a state of ketosis causes a build-up of ketones which in turn act as a kind of sedative, preventing the sudden disturbances in the electrical functioning of the brain that lead to seizure activity. Full time carer Mrs Dandy added: ‘It has been absolutely brilliant. Neve only had to be rushed to hospital once in the last two years, whereas we went more than 60 times in the first three years. ‘She still has seizures every day but they are small and she copes with them. We haven’t had any bigger ones since February and prior to that we hadn’t had one for nearly two years. Mrs Dandy says that despite Neve's special diet she still has seizures every day . ‘Day to day the diet means I weigh every gram of every bit of food that goes into Neve’s mouth. ‘About 75 per cent of what she eats is fat in the form of healthy oils, and we make the rest up with protein, fruits and vegetables - but we even have to give her syringes full of oil. ‘As a result of the diet we’ve managed to wean her off some of her anti-epilepsy drugs, it’s been amazing to get to know our little girl without all the medications and the side effects that they cause.’ ‘Caring for a child with Dravet syndrome can be a very lonely and isolating experience because you have to spend so much time at home keeping your child safe,’ she continues, ‘we have a wonderfully supportive charity, Dravet Syndrome UK and I really don’t know what I would have done without all the practical and emotional support from other parents who are going through the same experience.’","Neve Dandy has a rare and severe form of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome .

"By . Emma Innes . The Beatles were Christmas Number One and David Cameron had not even been born when midwife Carol Chadwick started working for the NHS. Fifty years on, the 67-year-old grandmother is about to retire from Tameside Hospital. Mrs Chadwick, from Dukinfield, Tameside, said: ‘It's lovely bringing babies into the world, seeing new life and seeing new mums through difficult times, but I've decided it's time to retire. Carol Chadwick, 67, is retiring after 50 years in the NHS working as a nurse and then a midwife . Mrs Chadwick joined the NHS when she was just 17. She is pictured at Sefton Hospital in the mid-70s . ‘I've seen so many changes. At one time we didn't have the dads at deliveries. I think things now are more informal - the uniforms certainly are!’ Ms Chadwick, who has a four-year-old granddaughter, began her career with the NHS at 17 as a pre-nursing student at Macclesfield Hospital. She returned to her home patch in 1966 to spend two years at Ashton General Hospital before heading to Liverpool Women's Hospital to train as a midwife. In her first few years on the job, Ms Chadwick’s patch included the city's tough Scotland Road area which was home to families whose fortunes depended on the nearby docks. She then spent the 1970s as a nurse and midwife in Merseyside and Cheshire before returning to Tameside in 1981. Mrs Chadwick (pictured with her husband, Jeff, and their children in 1987) says that when she first became a midwife men did not enter the delivery room . Ms Chadwick, who is now a midwifery sister in the maternity unit's operating theatres, said: ‘I couldn't tell you how many babies I've delivered, but it must be thousands. ‘My daughter is 29, so I'm now at the stage where I'm delivering her friends' babies and that's really lovely.’ Ms Chadwick says she had always wanted to be a nurse and after finishing school aged 15 she went to technical college to get the qualifications she'd need to train as a nurse. She said: ‘So many things have changed while I’ve been working - most of them good. ‘People now are fitter than they were in the 1960s, and we have better diets. ‘Now we get many older mums, women in their 40s just starting their families but many of them are fitter and healthier than women in their 20s were 40 years ago. ‘Another thing is that years ago people used to die from things that now they don't. Mrs Chadwick (left graduating in 1968 and, right, as a young nurse in 1971) says that the uniforms nurses and midwives wear have become much less formal during her long career in the NHS . ‘And our attitude to patients has changed too - when I first started nursing if someone had cancer they almost certainly would die, but we wouldn't tell them. ‘The attitude was that you couldn't do a lot for a lot of people and you didn't tell them they were dying. ‘Then, at some point along the line, it was decided that it really wasn't our place to keep it from them. ‘I haven't watched Call The Midwife, but I think my time in Liverpool was a bit like that. ‘We would get lots of ladies who weren't very well nourished having lots of babies and that could lead to problems. ‘But even now at Tameside hospital there are ladies coming in having their eighth, ninth, even tenth baby.’ Mrs Chadwick says that while she has been in the NHS people's health and diets have improved. Image shows her class graduating at Ashton Hospital in 1968 . Mrs Chadwick (pictured with her son in 1986) said: 'It is lovely bringing babies into the world' She added: ‘Now, people want to go home sooner too. If there's not been any complications the ladies go home the same day or the day after they've given birth. ‘One time they were encouraged to be in bed for days - now that's the last thing we want people to do. ‘I've only been working two days a week for a bit and now I've decided it's time to go and I've handed my notice in.’ Mrs Chadwick says she hopes to spend her retirement enjoying time with her granddaughter and cycling in the countryside with her husband. Karen James, Tameside Hospital’s Interim Chief Executive, paid tribute to Mrs Chadwick’s service. She said: ‘Carol’s service to the NHS and Tameside Hospital has been outstanding and is to be applauded. ‘Her care, commitment and passion serve as a benchmark for all our staff and, while she will be sadly missed, we wish Carol the very best in retirement and thank her for her wonderful years of dedication.’","Carol Chadwick, 67, joined the NHS when she was just 17 years old .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A brother and sister have survived six heart attacks between them. Toby Jones, now six, was just four months old when he had his first heart attack and was diagnosed with a rare condition which causes muscle weakness. His three-year-old sister, Jessica, also has the genetic condition and she had her first heart attack at just nine months old. Melissa Jones, 31, says her children - Jessica and Toby - have had six heart attacks between them . Their mother, Melissa Jones, 31, said: ‘I’m so proud of my children, they are both such fighters. ‘To have to go through one heart attack is enough but for them to battle through six between them is incredible.’ She added: ‘I knew something was wrong with Toby when he was a few weeks old, he found it hard to breathe and eat. ‘It was a terrifying time, he had he first heart attack while at Leicester Royal Infirmary, when doctors were trying to establish the cause of all his problems. ‘It was horrendous seeing him lying there covered in tubes and wires, luckily doctors managed to restart his heart.’ Two months later he was diagnosed with congenital myasthenia syndrome. Both of the children have a rare condition that causes muscle weakness. Toby is pictured in hospital . Ms Jones says Toby has had four heart attacks and Jessica (pictured) has had two . CMS can cause deadly breathing problems which are triggered by fevers or infections. Ms Jones, who lives in  Syston, Leicestershire, said: ‘When I became pregnant for the second time I knew there was a high chance that I could have another child affected by the genetic condition. But  not once did I contemplate terminating the pregnancy. ‘My fears were right and just three weeks after Jessica was born she was diagnoses with CMS.’ Jessica had her first heart attack in May 2011. Her mother knew something was wrong when she began choking and medics confirmed she’d had a heart attack. Ms Jones said: 'I'm so proud of my children, they are both such fighters. To have to go through one heart attack is enough but for them to battle through six between them is incredible' Jessica was diagnoses with CMS when she was just three weeks old . She suffered a second one after getting pneumonia. Between them, Toby and Jessica have spent almost three years of their lives in hospital. They have had six heart attacks between them and are constantly picking up infections which can trigger the attacks. Toby has had four attacks with his sister suffering two. Ms Jones said: ‘In a strange way I was almost happy for Toby that his little sister was diagnosed with the same condition. Between them, Toby and Jessica have spent almost three years of their lives in hospital . Ms Jones says she knew there was a strong chance Jessica would also have the condition but that she did not consider a termination when she found out she was pregnant . ‘It meant that he had someone to relate to with his problems as he grew older, they are extremely close and help each other so much already. ‘I know they’ll probably have more attacks but we take each day at a time. ‘Despite their horrible illness they are the best kids in the world, they are so funny. ‘They don’t let their condition hold them back, they run around like normal children. ‘The condition is so rare doctors don’t know what the future holds but they are my little miracles and I have learnt to live with CMS and as a family we face the battles of the condition together.’","Toby, six, and Jessica, three, have the same rare muscle condition .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A third of us are struggling to cope at work because of depression, stress or burn out - but are you one of them? Do you feel hopeless, have trouble sleeping and get little pleasure from life? Or are you are you suffering from anxiety, perhaps fearing something awful will happen - or worrying about a host of different things? Now, two tests used by the Channel 4 . show Embarrassing Bodies aim to indicate whether you are suffering . from depression and/or anxiety, based on a few multiple choice questions . about how you feel. To take the DEPRESSION test, click below . The results of both tests will be discussed live tonight on Embarrassing Bodies at 8pm on Channel 4. Developed by doctors and called the PHQ-9 depression screener, the first test asks how often in the past two weeks . you have been concerned with a set of problems. Be aware it is not a diagnosis tool – only a . trained medical professional can diagnose you with depression. The aim is to provide a useful indication of your risk of suffering from . depression. The test, developed by doctors and called the PHQ-9 depression screener, asks how often in the past two weeks you have been concerned with a set of problems. The graphic above shows the results so far . To date, 165,000 people have taken the depression test, which grades people from low . to extremely high risk. Nineteen per cent of the respondents came out as extremely high . risk, with 17 per cent at very high risk. Despite this, 63 per cent of those questioned said they would not feel comfortable telling relevant work colleagues about their condition, highlighting the stigma surrounding the condition. Women were also at higher risk . than men, with 39 per cent of them recording an extremely high or very high risk . level, compared to 30 per cent of men. When it comes to regions. Wales is the most depressed region of the UK with 40 per cent having an extreme or very high risk. To take the ANXIETY test, click below . While people working in hospitality, food and drink were the most depressed, engineers were the least likely to be depressed. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety - and the results from this test also paint a worrying picture about the nation's mental health. Called the GAD-7 screener, it asks you to say how much you have been concerned by . certain behaviours over the past fortnight. Of more than 200,000 people polled, a staggering 46 per cent of people came out as high or very high risk of having anxiety.  It was as high as 48 per cent among women and 38 per cent among men. The anxiety test, called the Called the GAD-7 screener, asks you to say how much you have been concerned by certain behaviours over the past fortnight. The graph above shows the results so far . Again, those working in hospitality and the food and drink trade were the most anxious, as were the Welsh, with more than 50 per cent scoring as high or very high risk. Those aged 18-30 were most likely to be suffering with the condition, the figures show. And worryingly, only three per cent of those questioned said they would see their GP with anxiety. Instead, 81 per cent would either ignore the symptoms or try and deal with the problem on their own. The results of both tests will be discussed live tonight on Embarrassing Bodies at 8pm on Channel 4.","Symptoms of depression include feeling hopeless, having trouble sleeping and getting little pleasure from life .

"By . Emma Innes . Harry Dubois, 17, died after he developed a tear in his aorta and collapsed while watching TV with his father . A 'fit and healthy' schoolboy has died at just 17 because he had a rare and undiagnosed heart condition which usually affects elderly men. A-level student Harry Dubois collapsed while watching TV at home with his father and passed away in hospital. Tests revealed the privately educated teenager - a talented musician and actor - had suffered an 'aortic dissection' - a rupturing of the largest artery in the human body. The condition usually only affects men aged 65 and over who have a history of high blood pressure. Now a fundraising page set up by Harry’s family with the British Heart Foundation has already raised more than £10,000 as they campaign for more money to be spent on researching sudden heart defects amongst young men. Harry, who died earlier this month, attended the prestigious Cheadle Hulme School near Manchester and had been offered a place at Birmingham University to read American Studies. His father Mario, 52, a BBC executive from Hale, near Altrincham, said: 'Harry had a very busy life and social life and there was nothing at all to indicate there could be anything to worry about. 'There must be young kids and their families who could get better support to find the potential cause of what killed Harry. 'He was a lovely boy and was just the most thoughtful and caring person and he brought joy and sunshine into people’s lives. 'He was . quite a character across the school and not just in his school year. We . have had hundreds of cards and letters. He used to help younger children . with music. 'He . was one of those characters that was thoughtful and kind and very happy . which has been comforting in what has been a horrendous two weeks . following his death. 'The . reaction from friends and fellow pupils has confirmed what we already . knew; what a fantastic person he was and how loved he was.' Harry was rushed to hospital and doctors fought to save him but they were unable to do so . Harry - a keen singer and guitarist - was studying English Language, English Literature and Politics and at his school performed in stage productions of The Sound of Music and Annie. The tragedy occurred two days after Harry had complained of a pain in his back. It was thought he had pulled a muscle and he took some painkillers but just 48 hours later he became unwell and was rushed into hospital. His mother Debbie, 46, a production executive for BBC Sport said: 'Harry initially didn’t complain of pains in his heart or chest, he said it was his back. An aortic dissection is a dangerous condition in which a tear develops in the inner layer of the aorta. Blood is able to surge through this tear into the middle layer of the blood vessel, causing the inner and middle layers to be separated. This creates a blood-filled channel and if this ruptures through the outside of the aorta's wall, the condition is usually fatal. The condition is rare and is most common in men between the ages of 60 and 70. Symptoms are similar to those of other conditions meaning diagnosis is often slow. Early treatment dramatically improves the prognosis. Symptoms include sudden chest or upper back pain, loss of consciousness, breathlessness, sweating and difficulty speaking. The condition is more likely to develop in people with chronic high blood pressure as well as in those born with a weakened aorta. An aortic dissection can be fatal but it can also lead to organ damage and strokes. Source: Mayo Clinic . 'But it seems the reason why he had the pain on his back was because the aorta runs near the spine. On the night he collapsed, the ambulance arrived quickly and they were in the house for quite some time trying to revive him. 'They took him to A&E and doctors tried for another thirty minutes there but couldn’t revive him. What happened to Harry was just a bolt from the blue.. Nobody would have thought to look for the condition he had.' Mrs Dubois added: 'If you were happy, Harry was happy. He just had the most infectious giggle and laughed all the time and sometimes you didn’t know what the joke was but you laughed along with him. He always made people feel happy and was always smiling. 'At his funeral we asked people to donate to the fundraising site rather than bring flowers. 'We have received so many cards and letters from friends we never even met telling us stories about Harry, how thoughtful and kind he was, numerous things he did for people. 'It has been overwhelming but comforting too to know how loved he was by everyone.'Lucy Pearson, headmistress at Cheadle Hulme, said: 'Harry was a dearly loved and trusted friend, showing remarkable compassion and understanding through his work as a Peer Mentor, coaching younger students through their first year at the school. 'His passions lay in music and drama and he was a valued cast member of many school productions and singing groups. 'The way in which the school community has come together to grieve for him and to celebrate his life has been humbling and inspiring.'

"By . Kelly Strange . A mother who cannot smile due to a rare condition has refused corrective surgery - because she wants her children to appreciate different faces. Becky Deas, 33, has Moebius syndrome, a rare . neurological condition which paralyses facial muscles, meaning she has never been able to smile at her children. It has also left . her unable to blink or look left and right. Becky Deas, 33, turned down surgery to allow her to smile because she wanted her children to learn that people should not feel they need surgery just because they look different. She is pictured with her son, Logan . When asked by her seven-year-old son why she had never smiled at him, she explained that her face doesn’t work like his. Now, she has turned down the chance of surgery to enable her to smile because she wants to show her children how important it is to accept differences. Instead, she has developed other ways to show them how happy they make her. Ms Deas, from Manchester, said: ‘This is me, I am who I am and I want my children to accept differences. ‘I might not be able to smile on the outside but I am always smiling on the inside. I make sure my children know how happy they make me every day. I don’t need a smile on my face to do that. 'A real smile comes from the heart.’ Ms Deas (pictured with her son, Logan) was born with Moebius syndrome which causes facial paralysis . Mrs Deas (pictured, left, as a teenager and, right, with her son, Logan) was born with the condition but says she was not aware of it until she was 10 . She added: ‘A lot of people stare at me. I’m pretty sure they must think I’m miserable all the time but that could not be further from the truth. ‘Even I don’t recognise the face in the mirror because it doesn’t reflect how I feel inside at all.’ Moebius syndrome is a rare neurological condition that affects the muscles that control facial expressions and eye movement. The symptoms are present from birth. Patients are unable to smile, frown or raise their eyebrows. They often also have a small chin and mouth and a short tongue. Dental abnormalities are also common in people with the syndrome. The condition also affects the muscles that control the eyes so patients have to move their heads to look from side to side. In some cases, patients are unable to blink or close their eyes which can cause eye dryness or irritation. Other features of the syndrome include bone abnormalities in the hands and feet, week muscles, hearing loss and delayed development. Moebius syndrome is thought to affect between one in 50,000 and one in 500,000 people. The cause of the syndrome is unknown. Source: U.S. National Library of Medicine . Ms Deas was diagnosed with the condition when she was six months old after struggling to suck from a bottle. Her parents were warned then she would never be able to smile. But she didn’t become aware of her condition until she was ten. She said: ‘My parents took me to a conference about it and explained I was different. I hadn’t really notice myself at that point.’ But all that changed at high school when Ms Deas was bullied. She said: ‘That was the first time I ever wished I could smile. ‘The condition also means I can’t control my mouth so it hangs open and I was called awful names - like fish face.’ She was relieved when she fell pregnant in 2007 with her son Logan and doctors confirmed it was unlikely he would have the condition. But it was at moments like his birth that Ms Deas wished she could smile to show her joy. Instead she developed other ways, like using the tone of her voice, to express happiness to him and daughter Lexi, nine months. Ms Deas . says she did consider surgery to remove a tendon from her shoulder, . which could be used to help create a smile, but ruled it out for the . sake of her little ones. She . said: ‘As lovely as it would be to be able to smile at them, I didn’t . want my children to think it is necessary to have surgery to look the . same as others. ‘We are all different in one way or another and that is nothing to be ashamed of. ‘I’m delighted for people who do have the surgery, but it just wasn’t for me.’ Ms Deas could have had surgery to move a tendon from her shoulder in to her face to allow her to smile but she decided that it was not for her . Ms Deas (pictured with her baby daughter and friend, Lynn) says she is always smiling on the inside and that she hopes people realise how happy she is despite her lack of facial expressions . Ms Deas held an awareness day earlier this year to help people understand she isn’t glum and to raise awareness of her condition. She said: ‘I didn’t want to get into the situation of approaching people who are staring at me because that isn’t me, but I wanted to get the message out there. ‘I may not be smiling but I am certainly one very happy mummy.’ For more information, visit www.moebiusresearchtrust.org .","Becky Deas has Moebius syndrome, which causes facial paralysis .

"By . Mark Prigg . Researchers believe they have uncovered the mystery of the how the 1918 flu epidemic which killed 50 million people was so devastating. The say exposure to an earlier, less dangerous strain among children caused the 1918 strain to spread so quickly. The deadly flu virus attacked more than one-third of the world's population, and within months had killed more than 50 million people – three times as many as the World War I – and did it more quickly than any other illness in recorded history. Nurses care for victims of the 1918 Spanish influenza epidemic outdoors amidst canvas tents in Massachusetts. Researchers now say exposure to an earlier strain left people vulnerable to the pandemic strain, making it unusually effective. The researchers discovered that the pandemic virus arose shortly before 1918, when a human H1 virus, which they infer had already been circulating in the human population since about 1900, picked up genetic material from a bird flu virus (pictured, a 2004 swine flu virus). The Human influenza A virus usually sees higher mortality rates for infants and the elderly, but the pandemic virus caused extensive deaths in people ages 20 to 40, primarily from secondary bacterial infections, especially pneumonia. The authors suggest this was because many young adults born from about 1880 to 1900 were exposed during childhood to a H3N8 virus circulating in the population, which had surface proteins that were very different from those of the H1N1 virus. In contrast, most individuals born earlier or later than 1880-1900 would have had better protection because they were more likely to have been exposed a virus variant more similar to the 1918 virus. However, until now, the origin of the 1918 pandemic flu virus and its unusual severity have baffled health experts. A new study led by Michael Worobey, professor in the University of Arizona Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, within of the College of Science, not only sheds light on the devastating 1918 pandemic, but could also improve vaccination strategies, and pandemic prevention and preparedness. 'If our model is correct, then current medical interventions, especially antibiotics and vaccines, against several pneumonia-causing bacteria, could be expected to dramatically reduce mortality, if we were faced today with a similar set of pandemic ingredients,' Worobey said. 'Ever since the great flu pandemic of 1918, it has been a mystery where that virus came from and why it was so severe and, in particular, why it killed young adults in the prime of life,' Worobey added. 'It has been a huge question whether there was something special about that situation, and whether we should expect the same thing to happen tomorrow.' Worobey and his colleagues developed an unprecedentedly accurate 'molecular clock' approach to untangle the origins of the 1918 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus, the classical swine H1N1 influenza virus, and the post-pandemic seasonal H1N1 lineage that circulated from 1918 until 1957. A molecular clock is a technique used in evolutionary biology to reconstruct family trees of organisms – or viruses – based on the number of genetic mutations accumulating over time. The researchers discovered that the pandemic virus arose shortly before 1918, when a human H1 virus, which they infer had already been circulating in the human population since about 1900, picked up genetic material from a bird flu virus. 1918, France --- Patients lie in Influenza Ward No. 1 in U.S. Army Camp Hospital No. 45 in Aix-les-Baines, France, during World War I as doctors battled the virus and the effects of the War . The Human influenza A virus usually sees higher mortality rates for infants and the elderly, but the pandemic virus caused extensive deaths in people ages 20 to 40, primarily from secondary bacterial infections, especially pneumonia. The authors suggest that this likely was because many young adults born from about 1880 to 1900 were exposed during childhood to a putative H3N8 virus circulating in the population, which had surface proteins that were very different from those of the H1N1 virus. In contrast, most individuals born earlier or later than 1880-1900 would have had better protection because they were more likely to have been exposed a virus variant more similar to the 1918 virus. 'You can picture the flu virus as a tiny soccer ball studded with lollipops,' Worobey explained. 'The candy part of the lollipop is by far the most potent part of the flu virus, against which our immune system can make antibodies. 'If antibodies cover all the lollipop heads, the virus can't even infect you.' For example, a person exposed to a flu strain studded with blue candy lollipops would have antibodies protecting it from future infections with that flu virus. Lacking a reliable cure, public health groups concentrated on prevention as seen in this poster by the Anti-Tuberculosis League. The deadly flu virus attacked more than one-third of the world's population, and within months had killed more than 50 million people – three times as many as the World War I – and did it more quickly than any other illness in recorded history. Most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill juvenile, elderly, or already weakened patients; in contrast the 1918 pandemic predominantly killed previously healthy young adults. To maintain morale, wartime censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in Germany, Britain, France, and the United States. However, newspapers were free to report the epidemic's effects in Spain, creating a false impression of Spain as being especially hard hit - and leading to the pandemic's nickname Spanish flu. The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation, researchers believe. The global mortality rate from the 1918/1919 pandemic is not known, but an estimated 10% to 20% of those who were infected died, with estimates of the total number of deaths ranging from 50-100 million people. However, if faced with a different strain containing red candy, that same person would get sick because the “anti-blue” antibodies would not recognize the red lollipops, allowing the virus to slip through the body’s immune defenses unscathed. 'We believe that the mismatch between antibodies trained to H3 virus protein and the H1 protein of the 1918 virus may have resulted in the heightened mortality in the age group that happened to be in their late 20s during the pandemic,' Worobey said. Worobey said the new perspective applies not only to the pandemic of 1918, but might also explain patterns of seasonal flu mortality and the mysterious patterns of mortality when humans are infected by highly pathogenic avian-origin H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, commonly known as 'bird flu'. H5N1causes higher mortality rates in young people, and H7N9 causes higher mortality in the elderly. In both cases, the researchers found that the more susceptible age groups were exposed initially, as children, to viruses with a mismatched HA, and may suffer severe consequences similar to young adults faced with a mismatched virus in 1918. Members of the Red Cross Motor Corps, all wearing masks against the further spread of the influenza epidemic, carry a patient on a stretcher into their ambulance in Saint Louis, Missouri, October 1918. The authors suggest that immunization strategies mimicking the often impressive protection provided by initial childhood exposure to influenza virus variants encountered later in life might dramatically reduce mortality due to both seasonal and novel IAV strains. Earlier this year, Worobey and his collaborators published a study in the journal Nature providing the most comprehensive analysis to date of the evolutionary relationships of flu virus across different host species over time. The results revealed a rapid, global replacement of the genes in the avian flu virus coinciding closely with a horse flu outbreak in the 1870s that crippled the economy. They also challenged the accepted wisdom of wild birds as the major reservoir harboring the flu virus, from where it jumps to domestic birds and other species, including humans. Instead, the researchers found a very strong indication of spillover from domestic birds to wild birds.","Deadly flu virus attacked more than one-third of the world's population .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A fisherman in Brazil was left stunned when his latest haul included a piece of rocket. The sizeable chunk was found in the water and then dragged to shore by locals. Although rockets regularly fall into the ocean, it is not often that pieces as large as this are recovered. Scroll down for footage of the initial launch . People and police officers look at debris from a spacecraft launched from the European spaceport in Kourou in French Guiana - the South American French territory adjoining Brazil - after it was found by residents of Salinopolis, a city 182 miles (293 kilometres) from Belem, Brazil, on 28 April 2014 . The debris is from a spacecraft launched from the European spaceport in Kourou in French Guiana, a South American-French territory adjoining Brazil. Ariane 5 is a rocket manufactured under the authority of the European Space Agency (Esa) and the French space agency (CNES). It is built by EADS Astrium and operated by Arianespace. Among its famous launches includes Rosetta, a European spacecraft that will land on a comet later this year. Ariane . 5 carries payloads weighing more than 10 metric tons to geostationary . transfer orbit (GTO) and over 20 metric tons into low-Earth orbit (LEO). It . lofts some of the heaviest spacecraft in production, which enables . Arianespace to match up most telecommunications satellites for highly . efficient dual launches. It . is powered during the initial flight phase by a cryogenic core stage . and two solid rocket boosters, followed by the use of a cryogenic upper . stage for orbital injection of the payload. The rocket has a typical height of 165 feet (50 metres) and weighs about 750 tons. The discovery was made by residents of Salinopolis, a city 182 miles (293 km) from the city of Belem in Brazil. It was confirmed to be a piece of rocket by the UK Space Agency. 'The object found in #Brazil was fairing from the Ariane 5 rocket that launched AlphaSat #lostandfound,' they posted on Twitter. The piece of wreckage bears the logo of the UK Space Agency and Arianespace, the European satellite launch company. On the corner can also be seen party of the logo for CNES, the French space agency. The hunk of metal originates from an Ariane 5 rocket. Specifically it is from the VA-214 mission, which launched on 25 July 2013. This mission carried two satellites into orbit, Alphasat I-XL (Europe’s largest ever telecommunications satellite) and INSAT-3D (a meteorological spacecraft for India). It was the 70th flight of the Ariane 5, Arianespace’s heavy-lift launcher. The vehicle lifted off at 4:54pm local time, with flight time to orbit lasting 33 minutes. The piece of rocket was found by fisherman Manoel Alves, 73, in the Village Macapazinho. It is a big plate of carbon fiber from the outer hull on the payload fairing.

The piece of rocket found in Brazil originated from an Ariane 5 rocket (circled in image) that was launched on 25 July 2013. The mission, dubbed VA-214, carried two satellites into orbit, Alphasat I-XL (Europe's largest ever telecommunications satellite) and INSAT-3D (a meteorological spacecraft for India) During ascent, certain parts of the spacecraft are expended. First, the expendable boosters on the side are jettisoned when they run out of fuel. Later, the main ‘payload fairing,’ which is the section covering the top of the rocket, is also detached. It is from the payload fairing that this particular section of the rocket is from. The fairing is used to protect the interior spacecraft from intense heat and forces as the rocket passes through the atmosphere into space. Most launchpads are located near vast uninhabited regions, such as open ocean or desert. The launchpad at French Guiana flies directly over the huge Atlantic Ocean, so as the parts are jettisoned they fall harmlessly into the water. In some rare instances such as this, though, pieces of the rocket can wash onto shore. On the debris were various markings that revealed its origin. At the top can be seen the year and contract number when the mission was first devised. This was the 70th flight for Arianespace's highly successful Ariane 5 family of rockets . Fisherman Manoel Alves, pictured front right, found the large piece of debris at the bottom of the  Guamá River.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Carrying a phone in your pocket all day may seem harmless, but there's a growing body of evidence linking devices to impotence, infertility and low sperm count. Concerned about the health of his 'little swimmers', a physician from London created a range of underwear fitted with silver 'cages' to protect them from radiation. The mesh of silver is woven into the fabric of the pants and shields the wearer from electromagnetic rays from phones, tablets and other devices - creating a so-called Faraday cage. The cotton in Wireless Armour underwear, pictured, is woven with a mesh of silver that shields wearers from electromagnetic radiation. It creates what's called a Faraday cage that uses conductive materials to block electromagnetic energy. This radiation is produced by phones, tablets, laptops and other electronic devices . Faraday cages, named after inventor Michael Faraday, are used to protect electronics from interference. They are made using meshes of conductive material. These block external static and non-static electric fields. For example, systems in parliament, banks and stock market servers are protected by the technology. In the Wireless Armour underwear range, thin threads of silver are woven in with the cotton during the production stage. Wireless’ Armour’s Faraday cage fabric has been independently tested and was found to shield 99.97 per cent of Wi-Fi.

The campaign runs until 28 May and has been verified by Indiegogo as a genuine product. Perkins said: ‘Wireless Armour is designed to protect the health of a wireless generation glued to their mobile devices. Men who use mobile phones could be risking their fertility, according to two separate studies from Cleveland and Egypt. Both studies found a 'worrying link' between poor sperm and the number of hours a day a man uses his mobile phone. In . the Cleveland study, men who made calls on a mobile phone for more than . four hours a day had the worst sperm counts and the poorest quality . sperm. The Egypt research noticed the correlation after six hours of phone use a day. However, neither study found sperm count was affected. Doctors believe the damage could be caused by the electromagnetic radiation emitted by handsets or the heat they generate. Previous . studies found using a laptop has a similar impact on fertility levels . in men, due to the heat released from the battery. Elsewhere, the heat of kitchens has been linked to low fertility levels in some chefs. 'We are exposing ourselves to unprecedented levels of electromagnetic radiation and this is showing with our declining sperm counts and increasing cases of cancer. ‘Although the evidence is not conclusive it is piling up. Our goal is to make protection as easy as getting dressed!’ Last month, scientists found men who hold their mobiles for more than four hours a day are more likely to suffer from impotence than those who limit usage to less than two hours. For the study, researchers recruited 20 men who had experienced problems with erectile function in the six months prior to the study. They also studied 10 healthy men with no history of dysfunction. The men who had previously suffered from erectile problems were found to carry their devices for a ‘significantly longer time’ than the healthy men - 4.4 hours a day compared to 1.8 hours a day. This backed up the findings of two other, separate studies in Egypt and the U.S. from last year. Both studies found a 'worrying link' between poor sperm and the number of hours a day a man uses his mobile phone. However, all the researchers said more needs to be done to establish what causes the problem and the extent of damage mobiles can cause.","The cotton in Wireless Armour underwear is woven with a mesh of silver .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . and Mark Prigg . Last week Nasa announced to the world the steps they would be taking in order to land humans on the red planet. And now, in a video, they've revealed the missions, technologies and developments that will make a manned mission to Mars possible. The footage shows how current technology such as the International Space Station (ISS), in tandem with future endeavours - including visiting an asteroid - will see humans take the first steps on the fourth planet from the sun. Scroll down for video . In a new video Nasa has outlined the path it intends to take in order to land humans on Mars. Proposals to send people to the red planet have been floating about for a while, but now the space agency has revealed how such an endeavour will be attempted . In the video Nasa highlights the development of the heavy-lift rocket known as the Space Launch System (SLS) as being integral to a Mars mission. This rocket, when complete, will be the most powerful ever built - dwarfing even the Saturn V that took humans to the Moon. There will be two versions of the SLS rocket. The . smaller, 70-metric-ton SLS will stand 321 feet tall, provide 8.4 . million pounds of thrust at liftoff, weigh 5.5 million poundsand carry 154,000 pounds of payload. The massive 130-metric-ton-configuration will be the most capable, powerful launch vehicle in history. Towering a staggering 384 feet tall, it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds. It will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit. The huge lifting power of the SLS - up to 130 ton -  will enable it to take the components and fuel needed for a nine-month trip to Mars. This will be accompanied by other vehicles that will carry unmanned cargo spacecraft. Some of these could be powered by innovative means such as Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP), an emerging technology that is a form of ion propulsion. Meanwhile, advanced vehicles such as the Orion spacecraft will handled the manned aspects of the mission. On 4 December this year, Orion will launch on its first ever mission, completing two orbits of Earth without a crew before returning home. The mission is important as the capsule will be raised to an altitude of 3,600 miles (5,800 km), over 13 times higher than the orbit of the ISS. This will give it a very high re-entry speed of about 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometres) per hour - the fastest since the days of the Apollo mission. The purpose of this will be to test the re-entry capabilities of the spacecraft, as it will need to be able to handle these speeds when returning a crew from a Mars mission. Construction of the ISS, a key step on the path to Mars according to Nasa, began at the turn of the century and is now all but complete. Today the station is used to carry out a variety of experiments not possible on Earth in addition to testing capabilities that will be needed for future missions into deep space . On 4 December 2014 Orion will launch on its first ever mission. The capsule will be raised to an altitude of 3,600 miles (5,800 kilometres) to simulate a return from Mars, giving it a very high re-entry speed of about 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometres) per hour - the fastest since the days of the Apollo missions . 'Our next step is deep space, where NASA will send a robotic mission to capture and redirect an asteroid to orbit the moon,' Nasa said in the announcement last week. 'Astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft will explore the asteroid in the 2020s, returning to Earth with samples. 'This experience in human spaceflight beyond low-Earth orbit will help Nasa test new systems and capabilities, such as Solar Electric Propulsion, which we’ll need to send cargo as part of human missions to Mars.' A House subcommittee recently approved an authorisation bill that would allow Nasa to redirect an asteroid into the moon’s orbit, land astronauts there and use the asteroid as a testing outpost and way station on the way to Mars. 'Beginning in FY 2018, Nasa’s powerful Space Launch System rocket will enable these “proving ground” missions to test new capabilities,' Nasa said. 'Human missions to Mars will rely on Orion and an evolved version of SLS that will be the most powerful launch vehicle ever flown.' Later this decade astronauts will be sent on a mission to visit and study an asteroid using the Orion spacecraft. This will enable them not only to perform key science at the asteroid, including analysing its composition and structure, but it will also prove as a test mission for journeys into deep space . Nasa's 'Path to Mars' graphic sets out the steps needed to send humans to an asteroid and Mars by the 2030s . How it compares: The SLS is larger than the Saturn rockets than launched man to the Moon. It will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today. Russia's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled. However construction of the first stage of Russia's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway . The agency will now have to spell out the cost and details of the mission as part of an exploration 'roadmap' to Mars that Nasa will have to submit to Congress. Associate Nasa Administrator Bill Gerstenmaier told members of a Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation subcommittee that the agency remains on target to launch an uncrewed mission in 2017 to test the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion multi-purpose crew vehicle that will carry astronauts to Mars. Avionics testing of solid rocket boosters was completed last week at Kennedy Space Center in preparation for tests of the SLS rocket's components, and acoustic testing is also underway. 'There is real hardware in manufacture for the path to Mars,' Gerstenmaier told senators. 'Our architecture is designed for long-term human exploration of our solar system, including the goal of human missions to Mars.' The hearing, called 'From Here to Mars,' outlined intermediate space missions being planned as steps toward long-duration space travel. 'With the technologies and techniques we develop, we will enable expeditions to multiple destinations, ultimately allowing us to pioneer Mars and other destinations as we lay the groundwork for permanent human settlements in the solar system,' Gerstenmaier  said. NASA would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide. They would then tow or push it towards Earth so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon. In 2021 astronauts would then use an Orion capsule - a manned spacecraft - to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for analysis. This asteroid would also, probably in the 2030s, be used as a stop-off point for astronauts on their way to Mars. Exact details on how Nasa plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory are not yet known, but the most recent rendering rendering shows it is captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag. The mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. After the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object. Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows. After the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loops around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean – likely the Pacific – 10 days later, as seen in the video. One planned mission is to a near-Earth asteroid, Gerstenmaier said. 'Nasa will employ SLS and Orion for an early human exploration mission to perform pioneering human operations further from the Earth than ever before, rendezvousing with and returning samples from an asteroid redirected to at stable orbit around the Moon by the robotic segment of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (Arm),' he explained. 'We're going to grab a piece of the solar system, we're going to deflect it around the moon and insert it into a distant retrograde orbit around the moon where our crews can go visit,' he said. 'To think we're moving a piece of the solar system for our use that will allow us to learn skills and techniques that we need to push the human presence into the solar system, that's a pretty awe-inspiring statement.' However, the ambitious Mars mission could be delayed or derailed if funding from a budget-conscious Congress continues to erode, or if other countries’ plans for a lunar mission force the U.S. to change course for security reasons.","Nasa has unveiled the steps they will need to take on the 'Path to Mars'

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Think heading into the wild is the best way to steer clear of technology? Think again. For those who can't face social media exile when they head to the cottage, lake or woods, Parks Canada said it will offer Wi-Fi in some of its spectacular outposts. It claims that, in the digital age, sending a tweet could replace writing a postcard around a campfire. Canada Parks has announced plans to roll out Wi-Fi services to a select few of its 44 national parks, 167 historic sites and four marine conservation areas such as the Bay of Fundy (pictured). The move is designed to make nature walking and exploring appeal to a younger generation who like to post to social media sites . Canada Parks is a federal agency that runs 44 national parks and 167 historic sites, from the Bay of Fundy on the Atlantic to Baffin island in the Arctic. Parks Canada is an agency of the Government of Canada. According to its website, it ‘protects and presents nationally significant examples of Canada's natural and cultural heritage.’ It also ‘fosters public understanding, appreciation and enjoyment in ways that ensure their ecological and commemorative integrity for present and future generations.’ The agency was formed on 19 May 1911.Its headquarters are in Ottawa, Ontario. It has 4,000 employees and an annual budget of about $500 million (£300 million). In total it runs 44 national parks, four marine conservation areas, one national landmark and 167 historic sites. It said they want to appeal to those who may not be able to embrace old-school quiet solace without posting about their trip in real-time. For now, Parks Canada will outfit 15 to 20 of its sites, in a trial phase, to see how it goes, said representative François Duclos. ‘Canada is a very big country, and it has become very urban. And for young people from cities, things are different,’ Duclos said. He noted that some people were also required to stay in constant contact with their workplaces, even while whale-watching or on a break from hiking. The goal is to bring 75 of its sites online with Wi-Fi in the next three years. By the end of this year, the agency hopes to have at least 25 hotspots up and running. But they are not intended to distract people from taking in the beauty of their surroundings. Rather, Parks Canada wants to attract a younger generation by giving them the chance to share the experience more easily with others. And the hotspots will be limited to camping areas, with more remote places left free of Wi-Fi interference. Is this the future of camping? According to Andrew Campbell, Vice-President of Canada Parks, sending a tweet or posting a status to Facebook is the 'digital way' of sitting around a campground and writing a postcard . This aerial photo shows a lake and forests in Alberta Province, Canada. The new plans could see 25 Wi-Fi hotspots installed in Canada's national parks and historic sites in the coming year, with about 75 expected to be up and running by 2017 . ‘When you start to look at the hotspot and how wide they’ll range, you’re not going to be on top of the mountain and on the middle of the glacier and getting Wi-Fi service,’ Canada Parks Vice-President Andrew Campbell told the Calgary Herald. ‘It’s going to be around your campground at night where you’re going to communicate to your friends and family in ways that a lot of people do today, through Facebook or Twitter, putting your Instagram photo up. 'People used to sit around their campground and write postcards. I guess this is the digital way of doing that.' The various sites, parks and areas that Parks Canada manages are visited by about 20 million people a year. Many of the locations, however, are devoid of 3G or 4G coverage, leaving campers with no means of communication with the outside world. In addition to making their experience easier to share, the hot spots could also help in emergency situations. Parks Canada says the Wi-Fi will be free of charge in most places, but in some areas where it is harder to install they may charge a fee.","Canada Parks is planning to roll out Wi-Fi hotspots to dozens of locations .

"By . Mark Prigg . Type 2 diabetes could cause the brain to age by up to two years every decade a person has the disease, researchers have claimed. It is the first time diabetes has been linked to a change in the size of the brain. The study also found that, contrary to common clinical belief, diabetes may not be directly associated with small vessel ischemic disease, where the brain does not receive enough oxygenated blood. Doctors found that for every 10 years a patient has diabetes, their brain looks approximately two years older than that of a non-diabetic person in terms of gray matter volume. According the American Diabetes Association (ADA), nearly 26 million people in the United States have diabetes, and 1.9 million more are diagnosed with the disease each year. Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, either the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the cells ignore the insulin that is produced. The ADA estimates that, based on current trends, as many as one in three American adults will have diabetes in the year 2050. 'We found that patients having more severe diabetes had less brain tissue, suggesting brain atrophy,' said lead author R. Nick Bryan, M.D., Ph.D., professor of radiology at the Perleman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. 'They did not seem to have more vascular disease due to the direct effect of diabetes.' According the American Diabetes Association (ADA), nearly 26 million people in the United States have diabetes, and 1.9 million more are diagnosed with the disease each year. Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, either the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the cells ignore the insulin that is produced. The ADA estimates that, based on current trends, as many as one in three American adults will have diabetes in the year 2050. 'As diabetes becomes more common, better understanding of the disease and its management becomes even more important in order to minimize its effect on patient health,' Dr. Bryan said. For the study, Dr. Bryan and colleagues used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the association between severity and duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus and brain structure in 614 patients (mean age 62 years). The mean duration of disease in the study group was 9.9 years. The researchers specifically tested whether more severe diabetes was inversely correlated with brain volumes and positively correlated with ischemic lesion volumes. The ADA estimates that, based on current trends, as many as one in three American adults will have diabetes in the year 2050. The results showed that longer duration of diabetes was associated with brain volume loss, particularly in the gray matter. However, the study found no association of diabetes characteristics with small vessel ischemic disease in the brain. 'Diabetes duration correlated primarily with brain atrophy,' Dr. Bryan said. 'Stated another way, our results suggested that, for every 10 years of diabetes duration, the brain of a patient with diabetes looks approximately two years older than that of a non-diabetic person, in terms of gray matter volume.""The researchers noted that their findings may have implications for future decline of cognitive function in patients with diabetes and raise the possibility that such cognitive changes might not be strongly related to vascular dementia but to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.","26 million people in the United States have diabetes .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . In a significant step towards reducing emissions, European scientists have created the world’s first renewable jet fuel using only sunlight, water and carbon dioxide. If proved on a larger scale, the process could provide the holy grail of renewable energy by creating an on-demand supply of fuel for planes, cars and other vehicles. The achievement was announced by researchers in the Solar-Jet project who have spent the past four years creating a solar reactor that uses focused sunlight to heat up metal oxide. Scroll down for video... European scientists have created the world's first renewable jet fuel using only sunlight, water and carbon dioxide. If proved on a larger scale, the process may provide a sustainable and scalable supply of fuel for planes, cars and other vehicles. Pictured is the solar reactor used in the process . Water and carbon monoxide are then passed into the reactor at 700°C, where they split up and form a synthetic gas composed of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. ‘The basic idea is to reverse the combustion process,’ explained Patrick Le Clercq, who is responsible for the project at the DLR Institute of Combustion Technology in Stuttgart. ‘What we do is take carbon dioxide and water vapour, and introduce energy to produce fuel.’ The gas is then compressed and sent to Shell, where it is transformed into a hydrocarbon fuel similar to kerosene during a process known as Fischer-Tropsch. The achievement was made by a four-year project, known as Solar-Jet, which has designed a solar reactor that uses focused sunlight to heat up a metal oxide. On the right is the solar reactor at work, while the left image shows a computer model of the design . In the first step, concentrated light - simulating sunlight - was used to convert carbon dioxide and water to synthetic gas known as syngas. This was done in a high-temperature solar reactor containing metal-oxide based materials. The syngas - a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide - was then converted into kerosene by Shell using the established Fischer-Tropsch process. Although producing syngas through concentrated solar radiation is still at an early stage of development, the processing of syngas to kerosene is already being deployed by companies, including Shell, on a global scale. Combining the two approaches has the potential to provide secure, sustainable and scalable supplies of aviation fuel as well as diesel and gasoline, or even plastics. ‘This large-scale method is already in widespread use throughout the world and has been certified for aviation purposes,’ said Le Clercq. ‘This means the fuel produced using this technique will not need to undergo any new, extensive testing and certification procedures.’ The project is still at the experimental stage, with only a glassful of jet fuel produced in laboratory conditions, using simulated sunlight. But scientists believe this process could provide a cheaper and more sustainable supply of renewable energy for transport applications. 'This technology means we might one day produce cleaner and plentiful fuel for planes, cars and other forms of transport,' said European Commissioner Máire Geoghegan-Quinn. ‘This could greatly increase energy security and turn one of the main greenhouse gases responsible for global warming into a useful resource.’ Finding new, sustainable sources of energy is a priority under Horizon 2020 - the seven-year EU research and innovation programme launched at the start of this year. Solar-Jet project partners include the German Aerospace Center (DLR), ETH Zürich, Bauhaus Luftfahrt and Shell. Concentrated light was used to convert carbon dioxide and water to synthetic gas. This was done in a high-temperature solar reactor containing metal-oxide based materials. The syngas - a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide - was then converted into kerosene . The project is still at the experimental stage, with only a glassful of jet fuel produced in laboratory conditions (pictured), using simulated sunlight. But scientists believe this process could provide a cheaper and more sustainable supply of renewable energy for transport applications .","Solar-Jet project created reactor that uses sunlight to heat metal oxide .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge enjoyed an adrenaline-fuelled jet boat ride through the famous Shotover River Canyons near Queenstown today. William and Kate were passengers on the white-knuckle Shotover Jet as it raced at 75 mph along the Shotover River on New Zealand's South Island. The experience has been a major . tourist attraction in the area, which is a mecca for thrillseekers, since the 1970s. White-knuckle ride: William and Kate in the bright red boat as it races 75 mph along New Zealand's Shotover River . In safe hands: Shotover Jet operations manager Wayne Paton has worked for the company for 13 years . The two drivers chosen to take the Royal party out on the adventurous trip said they were ‘thrilled and proud’ and called . the outing a ‘career highlight’. Shotover Jet operations manager Wayne Paton, 43, and head boat driver Nick Simpson, 39, were handpicked for the role thanks to their extensive industry knowledge and the number of hours spent on the water with passengers. Mr Paton, originally from Christchurch, and Nick from mid-Canterbury, have worked for Shotover Jet for 13 and ten years respectively. While both admitted to being 'a few butterflies' on the day, Wayne took the wheel of the boat containing the Duke and Duchess, while Nick followed close behind with other members of the Royal party. Safety first: The Royal couple had to don lifejackets before embarking on the thrilling half-hour ride . Making a splash: William urged the captain of the jet boat to go even faster on the adrenaline-fuelled ride . The Royal couple had to don lifejackets and undertake a safety briefing before embarking on the thrilling half-hour ride. They then sped along the famous . Shotover River and through the stunning Shotover River Canyons over water as shallow as 10cm. Mr Paton took them perilously close to boulders, shallows and upturned trees during the nerve-jangling journey. The 15-seater bright red boat passed just inches from the sides of the ravine at breathtaking speed and span through 360 degree turns. Mr Paton said: 'William kept on shouting at me 'go closer, Wayne, go closer'. Kate was amazed that the boats could go over such shallow water but the prince was very knowledgeable about how they worked. 'They screamed and shouted at some of the more hair-raising bits and seemed to have a great time. 'They had a blast, so that’s my job well done.' Career highlight: Shotover Jet boat drivers Wayne Paton (left) and Nick Simpson said they were 'thrilled' to take out their Royal passengers on the water today . Nerve-jangling journey: Mr Paton took his passengers perilously close to boulders, shallows and upturned trees . The jet boats, which are powered by a revolutionary water jet system, were invented by New Zealander Sir William Hamilton and tour operators have been using them in the region for over 40 years. Wayne said he talked to the Duke and . Duchess and others on the boat about how jet boating was invented, the river’s gold history and pointed out landmarks such . as Coronet Peak along the way. 'Yes there were some nerves but I feel safer driving the boat than I do driving my car home, because it’s what we do as a job.' Stunning location: Shotover Jet is the only company permitted to operate within the famous Shotover River Canyons . Having a blast: The Shotover Jet is a popular tourist activity in Queenstown, which is known as the adventure capital of New Zealand . The Shotover Jet, the aquatic . equivalent of rallying, takes passengers through a four-mile stretch of . the Shotover river near Queenstown on South Island. The . company is the only one permitted to operate within the famous Shotover . River Canyons, which consist primarily of steep rock walls that have . been carved over thousands of years by billions of tonnes of fast . flowing river water from the heart of the Southern Alps. The tourist firm takes 130,000 tourists a year on trips along the fast flowing river. 'When we step in that boat we’re responsible for everyone on board, but we know what we’re doing out there,' said Wayne. 'I’ve . done over 10,000 trips and I’m in charge of all driver training and . assessments, so while these are obviously the most high-profile people . we’ve ever had on board, at the end of the day they’re customers looking . for an amazing adrenalin experience and we treated them just like . that.' Queenstown, which is on New Zealand's South Island, is also a major destination for snowboarders, skiers and was the place where the bungee jump was invented. Taking a joy ride: Kate and Wills seemed to love the high energy ride in their bright red vests . Nick, who has driven nearly 13,000 . trips on the Shotover River, said the day had started as every other one . did, with the drivers and mechanics going over each boat in painstaking . detail. 'Maintenance is . second-to-none in our world, and that’s why Shotover Jet is so proactive . in our maintenance programmes and driver training. 'Yes, we operate in an amazing and fun environment, but its safety first and fun second, that can’t be emphasised enough. 'We’ve got 100 per cent trust in our boats and as far as being on the river, as drivers it’s our ‘happy place’. 'Out . of all the VIPs we’ve taken down the river over the years, it would be . hard to top taking these young members of the Royal family.'","The Royal party raced at 75 mph through tiny mountain passes on Shotover River .

"By . Adam Duggan . While most Australians were spending Good Friday settling in for the Easter long weekend, one group of committed drinkers spent their day loutishly terrorising a Perth neighbourhood instead. A video uploaded to YouTube last Wednesday by University of Western Australia student Ben Fromson, 22, shows the men drunkenly cycling from house to house in an event they called the ‘Tour de Fridge’. Visiting seven houses on their all-day drinking endeavour, the almost 80 men reportedly consumed 1,600 beers – an average of 20 each. Scroll down for video . Pedestrians beware: More than 80 intoxicated men take to their bikes during the 'Tour De Fridge' in Perth on Good Friday . No warning could ever be enough for their neighbours: Tour De Fridge participants converge in a Perth backyard, playing drinking games before riding on to another pit-stop on their binge drinking cycling trip . Unconcerned with the unsightly behaviour neighbours were subjected to, the men spent the warm day engaged in a public display of inappropriateness. Their 'tour' started with the men converging on their bicycles at one participant’s house, where they poured wine from a cask into one anothers mouths. At another early point in their tour, a smaller group of men can be seen pouring beer onto one participant’s hairy breasts and drinking it from his bare skin. Watch out for stray hairs: A Tour De Fridge participant drinks beer off a fellow participant's bare chest . Goon of death: One Tour De Fridge participant pours wine from a cask into another participant's mouth . As the day progressed, some of the men began removing their clothing and jumping into swimming pools. Being so intoxicated that they were vomiting wasn’t even enough to deter some of them – merely serving as an opportunity to empty their stomachs so they could drink more. It might seem like harmless fun to some, but the group appear to be showing no concern for the safety of local residents who may have come across the group.

Wrestling each other to the ground: Tour De Fridge participants are seen wrestling each other to the ground during one of their pit stops . Converging at a skateboarding park, intended for residents of the community to enjoy during the daytime – the men continued to put themselves at risk by jumping on tour participants as they attempted to perform bicycle tricks. Even potentially getting an infringement from police wasn’t enough to deter some of the rowdy revellers – with some participants continuing to drink alcohol during the ride on to the next house.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . The packing checklist for a girls’ break abroad can – most women would surely admit – be a lengthy one, with the shoes section alone capable of taking up several pages. But if there is one thing a female traveller does not need to take with her on holiday, then – according to new research – it’s a man. Holiday heaven for one: Two thirds of British women feel more confident taking a holiday by themselves . A poll of over 2000 British holidaymakers has revealed a growing trend for women to take trips abroad by themselves – with many saying they enjoy the experience far more than when they are accompanied by a husband, a boyfriend or a male companion. The survey, which was conducted by accommodation website Booking.com, revealed that 54 per cent of British women say they are more likely to take a foreign escape by themselves than they were five years ago – while almost two thirds (64 per cent) say that they feel more confident when taking a trip on their own than with a man. Travelling alone also seems to be beneficial to the holiday itself, with 61 per cent of women surveyed saying they feel more energised when taking a holiday by themselves – and more refreshed for the experience when they return home. Reasons given for these boys-not-invited breaks include a greater sense of freedom, and the chance to travel without having to cater to other people. Just short of two thirds of the women who responded to the survey said a break for one means they have the opportunity to be themselves while away. Staying in touch: 62 per cent of female travellers keep in contact by using social media while on their travels . And almost half – 47 per cent – said that a solo holiday is heaven because they can be selfish and do exactly what they like – without having to worry about a partner who wants to see different sights or do something else during a long day in the sun. ‘Our research suggests that the phenomenon of the female solo traveller is one that is here to stay,’ says Paul Hennessy of Booking.com. ‘A third of British female travellers are looking for that freedom to set their own agenda, and to find that boost in confidence that a solo break provides.’ The survey also showed that social media is the key way of communicating for the modern female traveller. Again, almost two thirds of respondees – 62 per cent – said that they keep in touch with friends and relatives at home by using the likes of Facebook and Twitter. And three quarters – 75 per cent – said that social media gives them the confidence to travel alone, enabling them to plan a route in advance, or unearth places to eat and stay. Which way from here? 64 per cent of women surveyed said a holiday by themselves gives them more freedom . The poll was conducted from a sample of British men and women, aged between 25 and 45, who have travelled away from the UK since April 2013. And half of the women surveyed enjoyed their holiday me-time so much that they tend to do it all over again – 51 per cent say they plan to travel solo again in the next 12 months.","Two thirds of women are happier travelling alone than with a male partner .

"By . Dan Bloom . Jeremy Clarkson claims the BBC has put him on his final warning for 'appearing' to use the n-word in unaired Top Gear footage - and he will be sacked if he ever makes an offensive remark again. The 54-year-old admitted 'not even the angel Gabriel' could survive after the threat - especially not a presenter renowned for controversy. And despite begging for forgiveness less than two days ago for the clip of him saying the nursery rhyme Eeny Meeny Miny Mo, Clarkson also claimed the Corporation had forced him to apologise and he did not want to. Scroll down for video . Apology: Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson said he had made . every effort to make sure he did not use the racist slur in a video less than two days ago - but has now said the apology was the BBC's idea and he didn't want to . Warning: The presenter, pictured apologising, said he is now on his final warning from the Corporation . Mr Clarkson, shown filming for Top Gear, when it is alleged he used the n-word - a claim he denies . Writing in his weekly column in The Sun, the presenter compared the apology to saying sorry for starting the Syrian civil war because they were both things he had not done. 'I've been told by the BBC that if I make one more offensive remark, anywhere, at any time, I will be sacked,' he wrote. 'And even the angel Gabriel would struggle to survive with that hanging over his head. 'It's inevitable that one day, someone, somewhere will say that I've offended them, and that will be that.' He also wrote: 'Happily, the BBC had a plan. Unfortunately, it wasn't a very good one. 'An apology is a good idea if you've just spilled some beer down someone's shirt...But saying sorry for using the most racist word of them all, and hoping the story would die down as a result?' The pressure to apologise even went against the advice of his own lawyer, he claimed. A solemn-looking Jeremy Clarkson said the item was recorded a 'couple of years ago' and said he 'did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted' Eventually, he said, he agreed to say sorry and insisted that when he did, he meant it from the heart. In his weekly column the presenter added he had 'become Hitler' and was being attacked by people calling for him to join sex offender Max Clifford in jail. The star became embroiled in controversy after unaired footage of him using the nursery rhyme to compare two sports cars was leaked to the media. Historically the rhyme was 'Eeny meeny miny mo, catch a n***** by his toe', and Clarkson said he 'mumbled' in two takes to avoid using the racist term - which made it sound like he was saying it. In the third, which was broadcast, he said the word 'teacher' instead. An online petition calling for the BBC presenter to be sacked has reached more than 1,000 signatures. Intervention: Deputy Labour leader . Harriet Harman (left) has called for the BBC to sack Clarkson over his . so-called use of the 'N-word' but Education Secretary Michael Gove (right) has . urged him to be kept . Labour figures including deputy leader Harriet Harman also demanded he should be sacked. 'Anybody who uses the N-word in public or private in whatever context has no place in the British Broadcasting Corporation,' she wrote on Twitter. And Labour MP Chris Bryant wrote: 'Clarkson announces he has one last chance. He's been in that saloon so long now he must be hammered.' But Education Secretary Michael Gove urged the BBC not to axe Clarkson because he had been 'clear in his apology'. And the Prime Minister appeared to agree. Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'He does . share the Education Secretary's view: it is absolutely right that there . has been an apology.' Pressed on whether he also shared the . view he should keep his job, he replied: 'His view is that in terms of . actions and the like, that's for the BBC.' Denial: The BBC presenter's first tweet immediately after the storm broke earlier this week . Row: Former newspaper editor Piers Morgan has tweeted regularly about a man who is often his nemesis . In his video apology - which he said took hours to complete because he could not remember his Twitter password - Clarkson said he 'did everything in my power to not use that word'. He added he was now 'begging your forgiveness for the fact that obviously my efforts weren't quite good enough'. 'I was mortified by this, horrified. It is a word I loathe,' he said. Controversy: The Top Gear presenter is regularly accused of being offensive . The BBC previously said it had 'left him in no doubt about how seriously we view this'. The claims come days after the motoring show's producer apologised for broadcasting a 'light-hearted' joke by Clarkson that sparked a complaint of racism. An episode filmed in Burma and Thailand featured a scene in which the presenters built a bridge over the River Kwai, and as an Asian man walked over it Clarkson said: 'That is a proud moment, but there's a slope on it.' Somi Guha, an actress who complained to the BBC, said the use of the word 'slope' was an example of 'casual racism' and 'gross misconduct'. In recent years Clarkson has been cleared of breaching the broadcasting code by watchdog Ofcom after comparing a Japanese car to people with growths on their faces. He previously faced a storm of protest from mental health charities after he branded people who throw themselves under trains as 'selfish' and was forced to apologise for telling BBC1's The One Show that striking workers should be shot. The motoring show has also faced complaints from Indian and Mexican politicians over remarks made about their countries while filming on location. A BBC spokesman told MailOnline today: 'We have nothing to add to the statement issued on Thursday.' That statement said: 'Jeremy Clarkson has set out the background to this regrettable episode. 'We have made it absolutely clear to him, the standards the BBC expects on air and off. 'We have left him in no doubt about how seriously we view this.' 'Ordinarily I don't respond to newspaper allegations, but on this occasion I feel I must make an exception. 'A couple of years ago I recorded an item for Top Gear, in which I quoted the rhyme Eeny, Meeny, Miny Moe. 'Now, of course, I was well aware that in the best known version of this rhyme, there is a racist expression that I was extremely keen to avoid. 'The full rushes show that I did three takes. 'In two I mumbled where the offensive word would normally occur and in the third, I replaced it all together with the word ""teacher"". 'Now when I viewed this footage, several weeks later, I realised that in one of the mumbled versions, if you listen very carefully with the sound turned right up, it did appear that I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure. 'I was mortified by this, horrified, it is a word I loathe. 'And I did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted. 'In fact, I have here the note I sent at the time to the production office. 'And it says, ""I didn't use the n-word here but I've just listened through my headphones and it sounds like I did. Is there another take that we could use?"" 'Please be assured I did everything in my power to not use that word. 'And as I'm sitting here begging your forgiveness for that fact that obviously my efforts weren't quite good enough. 'Thank you.'","He said he will be dropped if he makes a remark 'anywhere, at any time'

"By . Katy Winter . Princess Beatrice enjoyed a mid-week date last night with long-term boyfriend David Clark at fashionable London restaurant the Chiltern Firehouse. Virgin Galactic executive Clark and Beatrice have been dating for eight years and it seems that the flame still burns strong for Dave. The 31-year-old walked a step behind his royal beau as they left the restaurant, gazing at her in a rather besotted manner. Or perhaps the dreamy look was simply down to one too many cocktails? Dave Clark looks to still be in the first flushes of love as he followed Princess Beatrice out of the restaurant last night . The pair, who have been dating for years, chose trendy Marylebone restaurant Chiltern Firehouse for their date night . Beatrice looked stylish in a lose silk navy shirt with matching embroidered ballet pumps and a dark mini skirt for her night on the town. The Princess kept warm in a camel-coloured wool coat with a leather detailing and carried an oversized pale green leather clutch bag. The 25-year-old daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson has embraced London nightlife of late, attending a stream of high-end parties and events. The princess has transformed her image from conservative to chic recently and has been using her busy social life to show off her new look. Beatrice chose to dine out at the celebrity favourite Chiltern Firehouse again, having enjoyed a meal there just weeks ago. Beatrice wore a woolen camel-coloured coat over her navy ensemble to protect her from the evening chill . The two recently returned from holiday in St Barts where they relaxed on a luxury yacht . Beatrice dined at the smart Marylebone restaurant, loved by Kate Moss and frequented by an army of A-listers, on April 4 with a group of friends. The venue only opened in February but has already played host to celebrities such as Harry Styles, Rita Ora and Naomi Campbell. While Beatrice and Dave keep the details of their romance private, the pair show signs of becoming ever more serious. Just two weeks ago the young couple jetted off to the exclusive island of St Barts in the Caribbean for a little rest and relaxation aboard a luxury yacht. The stylish royal joined her boyfriend Dave Clark, 31, who had been enjoying a boys' holiday with friends. St Barts is a favourite of Princess Beatrice and her boyfriend, who last took a holiday there just four months before their recent trip.","Princess and long-term beau Dave Clark dined at Marylebone restaurant .

"By . Tim Shipman, Deputy Political Editor . Planning Minister Nick Boles told members of the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) that quiet villages 'need some noise' Planning Minister Nick Boles was branded a liar and a fool by countryside campaigners yesterday as he renewed calls to build homes on greenfield land. Members of the Campaign to Protect Rural England repeatedly heckled Mr Boles and walked out as he told them those who resist house building will condemn rural villages to being ‘museum exhibits’. The minister claimed quiet villages ‘need some noise’ in the form of younger people or they will ‘become fossilised’ or ‘embalmed’. The group’s annual meeting turned ugly when Mr Boles rejected CPRE members’ claims that developers are to blame for the housing crisis by refusing to build on 400,000 plots that have planning permission. But the minister insisted it was the failure to release enough land in the countryside for development which was the problem. Several CPRE members repeatedly yelled ‘it’s not true’ and two stormed out of the meeting in central London, accusing Mr Boles of failing to listen to their objections. Richard Nicholls, chairman of the CPRE’s Dorset branch, left saying: ‘I’ve had enough because the man doesn’t even understand what planning is about. He knows nothing about planning. The man’s a fool.’ A second angry member accused the minister of ‘not listening’ and another yelled that he was being ‘so simplistic’. Mr Boles lost his temper with the audience as he explained that of the 400,000 empty plots identified by the Local Government Association, only 126,000 are private developments that lie empty – the rest have building under way or are owned by housing associations. He accused the CPRE members of peddling ‘red herrings’. Repeatedly banging his fist, he said: ‘If you want to just trade in urban myths, fine. But I believe that a government minister has a duty to deal in facts. Those are the facts.’ CPRE president Sir Andrew Motion – the former poet laureate – branded the minister ‘Boles the Builder’ and said he ‘does a great harm’ to the countryside by refusing to admit that brownfield land is better suited to development than greenfield sites. ‘He leapfrogs brownfield sites and lands with a bricky crunch in the open countryside. He speaks up for greenfield housing estates rather than the green fields themselves,’ Sir Andrew said. Former Poet Laureate and CPRE president Sir Andrew Motion called the minister 'Boles the Builder'. He said Mr Boles 'does a great harm' to the countryside . Shaun Spiers, CPRE chief executive, accused Mr Boles of behaving ‘like a Russian tsar’ by accepting assurances from Whitehall officials that the planning system is working, rather than getting out around the country to see for himself – a charge the minister rejected. But Mr Boles warned that failure to release land for development would leave the young unable to afford homes in rural areas. ‘In Devon, Cornwall, Shropshire, Sussex, the Cotswolds and the Yorkshire Dales some villages are inches away from becoming forever fossilised,’ he said. ‘Their houses are so greatly prized by holidaymakers and those who have recently retired that young people working on nearby farms, local plumbers and carpenters and gardeners … can’t afford even the tiniest property.’ He added that instead of complaining, CPRE members should identify ‘ordinary fields’ near roads where development can take place and called on councils to ‘identify the land that could take more houses’.","Planning Minister Nick Boles said resisting new builds would turn rural villages into 'museum exhibits'
