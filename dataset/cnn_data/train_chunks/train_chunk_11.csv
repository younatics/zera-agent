"(CNN) -- Dubai could lose its place on the Women's Tennis Association Tour calendar after Israeli Shahar Peer was denied entry to compete at this week's event, the WTA supremo warned Monday. Shahar Peer told CNN she learned of her visa ban Saturday, just before her scheduled flight to Dubai. Peer was scheduled to fly into the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, but was informed Saturday night by telephone that she would not be granted a visa. WTA Chairman and CEO Larry Scott said the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour ""will review appropriate future actions with regard to the future of the Dubai tournament."" Scott added: ""The Sony Ericsson WTA Tour believes very strongly, and has a clear rule and policy, that no host country should deny a player the right to compete at a tournament for which she has qualified by ranking."" Peer, who had just finished playing in the Pattaya Open in Thailand, where she reached the semifinal, said she is ""very, very disappointed"" to have been denied the opportunity to play in Dubai. ""They really stopped my momentum because now I'm not going to play for two weeks and because they waited for the last minute I couldn't go to another tournament either,"" Peer said from Tel Aviv. ""So it's very disappointing, and I think it's not fair."" Watch Peer describe her disappointment » . Scott, meanwhile, confirmed: ""Following various consultations, the Tour has decided to allow the tournament to continue to be played this week, pending further review by the Tour's Board of Directors. ""Ms. Peer and her family are obviously extremely upset and disappointed by the decision of the UAE and its impact on her personally and professionally, and the Tour is reviewing appropriate remedies for Ms. Peer."" Scott said Peer's visa refusal has precedence: Last year an Israeli men's doubles team was denied entry to Dubai. He said the Emirate cited security reasons following recent unrest in the region. ""At that time I was in Dubai. I made it clear to the authorities, the representatives of the government, that next year when our top players wanted to play this very prestigious tournament all of them had to be allowed to play,"" Scott said. ""They had a year to work on it and solve it. We've spent time through the year discussing it. We were given assurances that it had gone to the highest levels of government,"" Scott said. ""I was optimistic they would solve it. And we've made crystal clear to the government, to the tournament organizers that there could be grave repercussions not just for tennis in the UAE but sports beyond that.""  Watch CNN's interview with Larry Scott » . The Dubai government issued a short statement through the state-owned news agency, saying that Peer was informed while in Thailand that she would not receive a visa. The agency quoted an official source in the organizing committee saying, ""The tournament is sponsored by several national organizations and they all care to be part of a successful tournament, considering the developments that the region had been through."" Earlier an official source who did not want to be named, said, ""We should check what happened in New Zealand, when Peer was playing there with all the demonstrations against Israel during the attacks on Gaza. We have to consider securing the players and the tournament."" In January, a small group of about 20 protestors waved placards and shouted anti-Israel slogans outside the main entrance to the ASB Classic tournament in Auckland. They were moved on before Peer played her match. The Israeli player said she's received phone calls of support from her fellow players. ""'All the players support Shahar,"" world No. 6 Venus Williams told The New York Times, adding, ""We are all athletes, and we stand for tennis."" Peer is uncertain of her next move. She said the last-minute decision had left her at a loose end. She said she was concerned about her points and ranking and may go to the U.S. this week to try to take part in another tournament. ""I don't think it should happen,"" she said. ""I think sport and politics needs to stay on the side and not be involved. I really hope it's not going to happen again, not only to me but to any other athlete.""

"(CNN) -- Russia will begin the construction of a new naval base this year in Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region of Abkhazia, according to a Russian media report Monday. Russia's Black Sea fleet is based in Sevastopol under a lease agreement with Ukraine that expires in 2017. Russia's Itar-Tass news agency quoted an unnamed official at Russian naval headquarters as saying it wanted to station vessels at the Abkhaz port of Ochamchire on the Black Sea, Reuters.com reported. ""The fundamental decision on creating a Black Sea Fleet base in Ochamchire has been taken,"" the official told Tass, in quotes carried by Reuters.com. ""This year we will begin practical work, including dredging, along Abkhazia's coast. ""It will take more than a year to implement all works."" The official added that the deployment was to protect the breakaway region from Georgian attacks. Georgia launched a campaign against South Ossetia, a Russian-backed separatist territory, on August 7 last year. The following day, Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities outside the rebel regions. The two sides blamed each other for starting the conflict and have made accusations of ethnic cleansing. Moscow has since recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent regions -- a move which angered many Western governments who suspect Russia of acting to thwart Georgia's ambitions of joining NATO. This latest development comes despite comments made last year by Abkhazia's leader that his territory would not be hosting Russian military bases. ""There will be no new bases,"" Sergei Bagapsh told Russia's Novosti news agency, adding that Russia's Black Sea Fleet will not be based in the republic either. ""Only units of Russia's ground forces that have always been based here will continue to be stationed in Abkhazia,"" he said. Russia's Black Sea Fleet is currently based in the port of Sevastopol which belongs to Ukraine -- another former Soviet state which, like Georgia, aspires to NATO membership. The fleet is due to leave Ukraine for good in 2017, in line with a 20-year lease deal signed in 1997. However, Russia's diplomats and military have said they want the fleet to stay at its traditional home base after the expiry of the deadline, Reuters.com reported.","Official: Russia to station vessels at Abkhaz port of Ochamchire on Black Sea .

"BEDFORD HEIGHTS, Ohio (CNN) -- After two years of traveling around the country and criticizing President Bush, President-elect Barack Obama said Friday that he ""always thought [Bush] was a good guy."" Barack Obama tells CNN's John King that it was ""tough"" for him to request the additional bailout funds. ""I mean, I think personally he is a good man who loves his family and loves his country,"" Obama said in an exclusive interview with CNN's John King. During the election season, Obama frequently campaigned against what he called Bush's ""failed policies"" and promised a ""clean break"" from the past eight years. Asked if there was anything he wanted to take back, now that he has spent more time with the president, Obama praised Bush's team for helping with a smooth transition and said part of what America is about is being able to have ""disagreements politically and yet treat each other civilly."" Obama also said he thought Bush made ""the best decisions that he could at times under some very difficult circumstances."" ""That does not detract from my assessment that over the last several years, we have made a series of bad choices and we are now going to be inheriting the consequences of a lot of those bad choices,"" Obama said. In addition to his relationship with Bush, Obama also discussed some key issues that he will face in the first days of his administration, including national security and the economy. Even before taking the oath of office, Obama has already faced a showdown with Congress over releasing what remains of the $700 bailout bill that Bush and Congress authorized before the election. The $350 billion that the Senate approved will come with specific conditions, Obama said. ""There's nothing wrong with us placing some conditions, making sure that the money's not going to executive compensation, making sure you're not seeing big dividend payoffs to shareholders and making sure that money is being left so that we can get credit flowing again, not just for individual homeowners who are losing their homes, but also small businesses who are the lifeblood of this economy. ""If they can't get credit, then they end up having to shutter their doors. And when they shutter their doors, people lose jobs. They then can't pay their mortgage, and you start down the road that we're on. We want to reverse that path, and that means that's the way we use the next $350 billion that Congress voted on, and that was a very tough vote for a lot of people. And it was tough for me to have to request it,"" he said. Obama sat down with King after he took a factory tour in Bedford Heights, Ohio.","Barack Obama says Bush made ""the best decisions that he could at times""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Barack Obama weighed in Thursday on the conflict between Israel and Hamas, urging Israel to open Gaza border crossings and telling the Islamic fundamentalist organization to stop rocket fire into the Jewish state. President Obama called on both Israel and Hamas to make changes toward Mideast peace. He urged Israel to allow the flow of aid and commerce into the Palestinian territory. ""Our hearts go out to Palestinian civilians who are in need of immediate food, clean water and basic medical care,"" he said. The crossings should be opened with an ""appropriate monitoring,"" he added. Obama said Hamas leaders, for their part, must put an end to rocket attacks. He said he will send former Sen. George Mitchell, who was appointed Thursday as special envoy for Middle East peace, to the region as soon as possible. Earlier, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived at her new office in the State Department, promising a renewed emphasis on candor and ""robust diplomacy"" as the primary means for advancing American interests around the world. America's new chief diplomat walked through the front doors of the State Department lobby shortly after 9 a.m. ET to thunderous applause from an overflow crowd of about 1,000 career diplomats and other department employees. ""I believe with all of my heart that this is a new era for America,"" Clinton told her colleagues. ""President Obama set the tone with his inaugural address. ... Robust diplomacy and effective development are the best long-term tools for securing America's future.""  Watch Clinton greet her new employees » . In remarks that could be interpreted as a rebuke of the departed Bush administration, Clinton also said that the Obama administration would not ""tolerate the divisiveness and paralysis that has undermined our ability to get things done for America."" Clinton also called for a new sense of candor and free exchange of ideas. She urged the country's diplomatic corps to think ""outside the proverbial box."" ""There's nothing I welcome more than a good debate and the kind of dialogue that will make us better,"" she said. Clinton later attended an intelligence briefing and a meeting with members of the Diplomatic Security Service. She also walked through various State Department offices, including the operations center. Clinton also phoned international leaders, according to acting State Department spokesman Robert Wood. She is expected to call Asian leaders later Thursday. Clinton will also visit the U.S. Agency for International Development, which she praised ""for the work they've done on behalf of development through some very difficult years."" During her confirmation hearing, Clinton pledged to secure more resources for the State Department and USAID, which has seen a lot of its development work fall to the Pentagon during the Bush administration. Clinton is the 67th U.S. secretary of state. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: President Obama urges Israel to open Gaza border crossings .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has blocked further consideration of a federal law designed to keep sexual material from underage users of the Web. The justices without comment Wednesday rejected an appeal from the federal government to reinstate the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), passed by Congress in 1998. The high court and subsequent federal courts said the law -- which has never taken effect -- had serious free speech problems. The Bush administration was a strong supporter of the law and the Justice Department led the fight in court to revive it. The justices issued their ruling a day after all nine were on hand for the inauguration of President Barack Obama. Retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor also attended the ceremony. The case tested the free speech rights of adults against the power of Congress to control Internet commerce. The Supreme Court twice ruled against COPA, arguing that it represented government censorship rather than lawful regulation of adult-themed pornography businesses. The law would have prevented private businesses from creating and distributing ""harmful"" content that minors could access on the Internet. Free speech advocates said adults would be barred access to otherwise legal material and that parental-control devices and various filtering technology are less intrusive ways to protect children. The high court in 2004 upheld a preliminary injunction against the law and sent the case back to lower courts for consideration of the arguments. In their opinion at the time, the 5-4 majority concluded COPA ""likely violates the First Amendment."" ""The government has not shown that the less restrictive alternatives proposed ... should be disregarded,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the 2004 decision. ""Those alternatives, indeed, may be more effective"" than the law passed by Congress. ""Filters are less restrictive"" he said, and thus pose less risk of muzzling free speech. ""They impose selective restrictions on speech at the receiving end, not universal restrictions at the source."" He added, ""There is a potential for extraordinary harm and a serious chill upon protected speech"" if the law takes effect."" In reconsidering the law, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, again ruled the law unconstitutional.","Justices reject appeal to reinstate the Child Online Protection Act .

"(CNN) -- Most of us know we shouldn't be talking on a handheld cell phone while driving. But recent studies suggest that hands-free devices are just as dangerous on the road. Studies suggest that talking on a hands-free cell phone while driving is just as dangerous as a handheld one. Engaging in a phone conversation on a mobile device while driving distracts the brain and delays reaction times, experts said. Drivers are more likely to swerve between lanes, slow down and miss important signs. ""When you're on a call, even if both hands are on the wheel, your head is in the call,"" said Janet Froetscher, president of the National Safety Council, which in January urged legislators in all 50 states to pass laws prohibiting motorists from using cell phone devices. A recent University of Utah study found that drivers engaging in a cell phone conversation on a headset were more likely to make errors behind the wheel than a driver talking to a front-seat passenger. ""It doesn't matter what kind of cell phone device they are using, because the impairments are so large,"" said University of Utah professor David Strayer, who used a high-tech driving simulator for his experiment. Strayer's study, published in December, concluded that conversations with a front-seat passenger can actually mitigate accidents, because the passenger can help observe road conditions and warn the driver of possible hazards. In Strayer's previous studies, he found driving while talking on a mobile device is ""just as bad as driving drunk."" The risk of getting into a car accident while talking on a wireless device -- including headsets and vehicles with built-in communication systems -- is growing as the number of cell phone subscribers increases. There are 270 million cell phone subscribers in the United States, up from 76 million in 1999, according to CTIA -- The Wireless Association, an organization representing the wireless communications industry. In a survey by Nationwide Insurance, 80 percent of people admitted to talking on their cell phones while driving. About 45 percent of drivers said they have been hit or nearly hit by someone using a cell phone, according to Nationwide's survey, conducted in 2006. Some experts said drivers talking on cell phones are four times more likely to get into a crash than those who don't talk on their phones behind the wheel. One study from the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis estimated that 636,000 traffic accidents each year -- about 6 percent of all accidents -- are caused by drivers using their cell phones, resulting in an estimated 2,600 deaths. Elderly and younger drivers are most at risk of getting into an accident when they talk on a mobile device while driving, said Arthur Kramer, a psychology professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ""I don't think legislation alone is the answer,"" Kramer said. ""Education needs to go along with the legislation to encourage people that these are risky habits for yourself and for others."" There is no federal law against using handheld devices on the road, but six states and the District of Columbia have such laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks legislative data trends. No states ban the use of hands-free or wireless communication devices, experts said. Some private industries, such as trucking and bus companies, prohibit their employees from using cell phones on the road. Other states restrict teenagers from talking on cell phones while driving. Anne Teigen, a policy specialist on transportation issues for the National Conference of State Legislatures, says states are moving to ban handheld cell phone use. Almost all states have debated the issue, but many governments are reluctant to pass restrictions because they say there isn't enough research. They point out that talking on a mobile device isn't the only distraction. Other distractions, such as reaching for the glove compartment, changing the radio station or putting on makeup, also can cause accidents. The popularity of smart phones equipped with Internet, text messaging and e-mail present drivers with even more distractions. Such new technology also makes it difficult for states to keep their laws updated. ""Then there is the final question of whether these laws are enforceable or not,"" Teigen said. Some members of the cell phone industry are advising drivers to stop using cell phones on the road, but few have taken a stance on hands-free devices, because research has been limited. Verizon Wireless was one of the first cellular phone companies to support hands-free driving laws in the early 2000s. The company is focusing on promoting laws against text-messaging while driving. So far, only a handful of states ban the practice. Aegis Mobility, a Vancouver, Canada, company, has created a device that would reduce cell phone usage in cars. The product, DriveAssist, set to launch this fall with a major network carrier in the United States, will enable cell phones to automatically detect when a mobile user is driving. Users can subscribe to DriveAssist's service, which manages incoming and outgoing calls, text messages and e-mails electronically. Callers get a message that the recipient is driving but can leave an emergency message alerting the driver to pull over and return the call. ""People find it hard to stop talking on their cell phones because we've been conditioned our entire life to answer the phone,"" said David Teater of Spring Lake, Michigan, one of the product's backers. Five years ago, Teater's seventh-grade son died in a daytime car accident after a woman talking on her cell phone ran a red light. ""Her life was ruined as well,"" Teater said. ""She had no idea what she was doing was so dangerous. The vast majority of drivers have no idea that it's dangerous.""","Study: Talking on a hands-free cell phone while driving is still dangerous .

"(CNN) -- German billionaire Adolf Merckle, one of the richest men in the world, committed suicide Monday after his business empire got into trouble in the wake of the international financial crisis, Merckle's family said Tuesday in a statement. Merckle, 74, was hit by a train in the southwestern town of Ulm, police said. His family said the economic crisis had ""broken"" Merckle. He was number 94 on the Forbes list of the world's richest people. He had fallen from number 44 on the Forbes 2007 rich list as his fortune declined from $12.8 billion to $9.2 billion in 2008. Merckle's business empire included interests as diverse as cement-maker HeidelbergCement and generic drug-maker Ratiopharm. But he lost hundreds of millions of dollars, including company capital, betting against Volkswagen stock last year. The state government of Baden-Wuerttemberg rejected his petition for financial assistance, and he entered bailout talks with several German banks. ""The financial troubles of his companies, induced by the international financial crisis and the uncertainty and powerlessness to act independently which the financial problems brought about, broke the passionate family business man, and he took his own life,"" his family wrote in the news release. An employee of Germany's railroad company found the body on the tracks at about 7 p.m. Monday and notified authorities. Merckle's family had already reported him missing earlier in the day after he walked out of the house and did not return. Authorities are currently conducting DNA tests to confirm his identity.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- It's a frightening scenario, almost a staple of action movies: Someone has fallen onto subway tracks, and a train is rumbling into the station. iReporter Stuart Gordon spotted rescuers after a woman fell onto subway tracks in Washington. For a heart-stopping moment, the train is certain to strike the fallen person, until rescue comes at the last possible second. But at a Washington Metro station near the National Mall on Tuesday, it was an all-too-real scenario, and all the more frightening. A 68-year-old woman from Nashville, Tennessee, in Washington for the inauguration of Barack Obama, fell off the platform at the Gallery Place-Chinatown stop. Houston Metro Officer Eliot Swainson, deputized to assist with the huge crowds for the inauguration, was aiding another rider when he heard shouts that someone was on the track.  Watch Swainson describe what happened » . ""I turned around and saw a lady standing in the track area,"" Swainson said. The former Houston police officer rushed into action. He and another Metro rider tried to pull the woman to safety, but with a Red Line train bearing down on the station, they didn't have the time. iReport.com: See photos of the rescue operation . ""The train was coming down the tunnel there,"" Swainson said. ""It was coming in closer. I pushed her down and got her tucked down under the platform."" Swainson cited training from Metro staff for giving him the information he used to get the woman out of danger. The woman, who was not identified, huddled beneath the lip of the granite platform as the train passed. An emergency response crew brought her back up onto the platform and took her to Washington Hospital Center, where hospital staff said she was treated and released. No further details were provided. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority spokeswoman Taryn McNeil said Tuesday that the woman had sustained cuts and bruises from the fall. The agency said transit officers from 18 locations across the country were in Washington to assist with the inauguration crowds. Ridership records were shattered Tuesday: There were more than 1.5 million trips across all the authority's platforms, including more than 1.1 million on the subway system. The Tennessee woman's accident was the only one reported on the transit line, the authority said. iReport.com: Are you there? Send your photos .

"(CNN) -- In her first interview since giving birth, the teenage daughter of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said having a child is not ""glamorous,"" and that telling young people to be abstinent is ""not realistic at all."" Bristol Palin says ""everyone should just wait 10 years"" to have a baby, rather than when you're young. ""It's just, like, I'm not living for myself anymore. It's, like, for another person, so it's different,"" Bristol Palin told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren. ""And just you're up all night. And it's not glamorous at all,"" she said. ""Like, your whole priorities change after having a baby."" The 18-year-old, who gave birth in late December, said she is being helped tremendously by her mother, grandmother, cousins and other family members. She is engaged to teen father Levi Johnston, who is now working for his father and trying to complete school, but said she wishes that she waited another 10 years to have a baby. It was ""harder than labor"" telling her parents she was pregnant. ""Well, we were sitting on the couch, my best friend and Levi, and we had my parents come and sit on the couch, too. And we had my sisters go upstairs,"" Bristol said. ""And we just sat them down, and I just -- I couldn't even say it. I was just sick to my stomach. ""And so finally, my best friend just, like, blurted it out. And it was just, like -- I don't even remember it because it was just, like, something I don't want to remember.""

Her parents insisted that she and her boyfriend hash out a ""game plan"" immediately. And now her parents and relatives are all pitching in to help take care of the child, particularly when Bristol is at school during the day. Van Susteren was delicate with the teenager but pointedly asked if ""contraception is an issue here."" ""Is that something that you were just lazy about or not interested, or do you have philosophical or religious opposition to it,"" Van Susteren asked. Bristol quickly answered that she didn't want to get into specifics. The best option is abstinence, the teen said, but added that she didn't think that was ""realistic.""  Watch Bristol Palin say that abstinence is ""not realistic at all"" » . While her mother was running for vice president, the teenager said her treatment in the media was ""evil."" She said she read some of the tabloids that wrote about her. People didn't understand, she said, and some media reports perpetuated falsehoods about her experience. ""They thought that, like, my mom was going to make me have the baby, and it was my choice to have the baby,"" she said. ""And it's just -- that kind of stuff just bothered me."" Van Susteren asked, ""But this is your issue? This is your decision?"" Bristol answered yes. ""(It) doesn't matter what my mom's views are on it. It was my decision, and I wish people would realize that, too,"" she said. The network interview was Bristol's idea, the teen said. And she apparently sprung the news to her parents that she was going to speak publicly the day before the network taping. The teen said she wanted to tell her story so that other young people might think twice about having sex. ""I'd love to [be] an advocate to prevent teen pregnancy because it's not, like, a situation that you would want to strive for, I guess,"" Bristol said. Gov. Palin made an unexpected appearance during the interview in Alaska, and Van Susteren asked her about her daughter's pregnancy.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Guantanamo Bay's legacy of torture will hurt the United States even if President Obama makes good on a pledge to close the prison camp, a former inmate says. Moazzam Begg says that during intense interrogations at Guantanamo Bay, he would have confessed to anything. Justice will be impossible to mete out to the alleged terrorists and war criminals held there because any confessions must be tainted by the methods used to obtain them, ex-prisoner Moazzam Begg told CNN. Begg says he would have confessed to anything during interrogations while he was held at Guantanamo for nearly three years. ""What procedure can you use on people who have been systematically tortured including waterboarding, including being stripped naked and beaten? What sort of evidence can be admitted into a court of law that has been extracted under that process?"" asked Begg.  Watch what Begg thinks of Guantanamo » . The new administration  has said that waterboarding, which causes the feeling of drowning, is torture. Begg, who is British, was captured during the war in Afghanistan and accused of aiding the Taliban regime.  His family has always maintained he was a victim of mistaken identity. He was sent back to his home in Britain by the Bush administration in 2005 and never prosecuted. President Obama on Wednesday moved closer to making good on his campaign promise. The administration is drafting executive orders calling for the detention facility's closure, officials said. Earlier in the day, a judge granted Obama's request for a 120-day suspension of prosecutions so a review of all cases of suspected terrorists could take place. During his inaugural speech, he stressed that ideals of justice did not need to be thrown out to ensure the nation's safety. ""Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake,"" Obama said.  Watch what could be next for Guantanamo » . Legal issues are already complicating the cases of some of the most important terror suspects, like Mohamed al-Qahtani, the so-called 20th hijacker, who has been accused of helping to plan and possibly participate in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Earlier this month, the retired judge in charge of determining which Guantanamo detainees should be tried by a U.S. military commission told The Washington Post that al-Qahtani was tortured and therefore could not  be put forward for prosecution. ""Guantanamo Bay is the most notorious prison on earth,"" Begg said. He said he believes Guantanamo is a radicalizing force for militants around the world. Looking beyond high-profile suspects, human rights campaigners say there is little evidence to prosecute dozens of Guantanamo inmates still being held. They argue that keeping those detainees locked up will not help keep al Qaeda at bay. ""I think it's actually one of the most harmful myths about it, that we can't let people go because we've got the tiger by the tail,"" said Cori Crider of the human rights organization Reprieve. Chris Arendt, a former guard at Guantanamo Bay, says the Obama administration must rethink and reform the way it detains and prosecutes future terror suspects -- and do more than just close Guantanamo. ""We're focused on this one camp that has become the star of the whole show. But there are camps everywhere,"" he said. ""There are camps in Iraq, in Afghanistan -- every country that American or the coalition forces have set their feet. None of those detainees are seeing any justice.""","NEW: Obama administration drafting executive orders calling for camp's closure .

"(CNN) -- A crusading Sri Lankan journalist shot dead last week knew he would be killed -- he said so in a dramatic, posthumously published column touching a raw nerve in his war-torn island nation. A candlelight vigil in the Sri Lankan capital in memory of slain journalist Lasantha Wickrematunga. Lasantha Wickrematunga, editor-in-chief of The Sunday Leader, was gunned down execution-style January 8 but spoke from the grave three days later when the newspaper published ""And Then They Came For Me."" That posthumous column anticipated his slaying by government forces and defended the craft of journalism in his country, a profession under fire during its bitter civil war. ""Diplomats, recognizing the risk journalists face in Sri Lanka, have offered me safe passage and the right of residence in their countries. Whatever else I may have been stuck for, I have not been stuck for choice. But there is a calling that is yet above high office, fame, lucre and security. It is the call of conscience,"" Wickrematunga wrote. ""People often ask me why I take such risks and tell me it's a matter of time before I am bumped off."" Wickrematunga wrote that he was twice assaulted and his house was fired upon. ""Despite the government's sanctimonious assurances, there was never a serious police inquiry into the perpetrators of these attacks, and the attackers were never apprehended. ""In all of these cases, I have reason to believe the attacks were inspired by the government. When finally I am killed, it will be the government that kills me,"" he wrote. Sri Lankan President Mahindra Rajapaksa, asked about threats to journalists, voiced assurance that no journalist or media institution had cause to fear any threats or attacks by the government, according to a statement on the government's official Web site.  Watch Sri Lanka's foreign minister discuss press freedom » . ""The government had no interest whatever in seeking disgrace through any attacks on the media,"" he said, and he assured media leaders that the culprits would be captured and brought to justice, the statement said. Hostility against journalists and their institutions has been high as the Sinhalese-dominated government forces work to eradicate the last vestiges of Tamil Tiger separatists in the Jaffna peninsula, the rebel-held northern region. The 25-year-old civil war has left more than 65,000 people dead. Sunanda Deshapriya, spokesman for Sri Lanka's Free Media Movement, said harassment of journalists has been common, and cited these examples from the past year: two journalists killed, another journalist shot at, more than 50 reports of intimidations and threats, 12 media personnel arrested, 16 journalists physically assaulted, one tortured, one assaulted in an abduction attempt, the circulation of a list with 27 journalists targeted for killings, the proposal of a censorship law, and the naming of some journalists as terrorists or terrorist supporters. On January 6, 15 masked gunmen entered Maharajah TV studios outside the capital, Colombo. The journalism watchdog group Committee to Protect Journalists said the attackers shot at and destroyed broadcast equipment, held staff members at gunpoint, and attempted to burn down the station's facilities. CNN on Wednesday interviewed the head of Maharajah TV, Chevaan Daniel, about the incident. Afterward, Sri Lanka's defense secretary, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, called for the arrest of a person who had talked to CNN, Deshapriya said. CPJ said the government-run media has criticized Maharajah TV for its coverage of a suicide bombing in the capital and ""undermining"" a presidential victory speech after government troops took Kilinochchi -- which had been the de facto capital of the Tamil Tigers movement. Government officials have condemned strikes on Colombo and have ordered probes. Bob Dietz, CPJ's Asia program director, said that ""far too often the government or its unofficial allies have been prime suspects behind attacks on journalists and media organizations,"" despite government condemnations and investigations. As the civil warfare first unfolded, Tamil journalists were targeted, Dietz said. But in the past year and a half, mainstream journalists, such as those who raise questions about the government's military activity, have been facing a crackdown -- even if they are from the majority Sinhalese ethnic group or sharply critical of the Tamil rebel movement. This includes Wickrematunga, who questioned the government's successes and value of its military actions. ""That really got under the skin of the government,"" Dietz said. ""It's one thing to insult the president, but another thing to insult the military during wartime."" ""This killing is the worst,"" said Dietz, who compared it to the impact that would be felt if a New York Times or Washington Post columnist were killed in the United States. Wickrematunga's killing spurred a demonstration in Colombo by 4,000 people, which Reporters Without Borders said was the largest since the government of Mahinda Rajapaksa took power three years ago. Another protest was to be held on Thursday in London. The title of Wickrematunga's column was inspired by a poem by a German theologian about how Germans failed to react to Nazism in the past century before it was too late. In his rendition of the poem, Wickrematunga wrote: ""First they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for the Communists and I did not speak out because I was not a Communist. Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me."" Wickrematunga pronounces his pride in his profession's attempt to chronicle life in a country at war and his paper's work to bravely represent all people -- ""Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, low-caste, homosexual, dissident or disabled."" He casts the paper as an independent organ that faithfully records events. He said the paper lacks a political agenda and wants to see Sri Lanka as a ""transparent, secular, liberal democracy."" ""No other profession calls on its practitioners to lay down their lives for their art save the armed forces and, in Sri Lanka, journalism,"" he wrote, adding that ""countless journalists have been harassed, threatened and killed. It has been my honor to belong to all those categories and now especially the last."" ""I have the satisfaction of knowing that I walked tall and bowed to no man. And I have not traveled this journey alone. Fellow journalists in other branches of the media walked with me: most of them are now dead, imprisoned without trial or exiled in far-off lands."" He also castigates the country's president, who had been a long-time friend. ""In the wake of my death I know you will make all the usual sanctimonious noises and call upon the police to hold a swift and thorough inquiry. But like all the inquiries you have ordered in the past, nothing will come of this one too.""","Lasantha Wickrematunga gunned down execution-style January 8 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Piracy off the coast of Somalia can't be stopped until there is some authority to bring pirates to justice, according to the commander of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain. U.S. Vice Admiral William Gortney: Need to hold pirates off Africa's east coast accountable. Because there is no working government in Somalia and no country is willing to take captured pirates, bring them to trial and detain them, there is no deterrent for pirates to stop attacking ships, Vice Admiral William Gortney said at a Pentagon briefing Thursday. ""The problem is there's not a way to -- until we have a mechanism [to hold them] accountable and try them for their actions, there's no way to -- to finish the problem,"" Gortney said. The United States is making a deal with a country in the eastern Africa region to hold and try pirates captured by the U.S.-led Combined Task Force 151, a new maritime anti-piracy mission started earlier this month. He said an official announcement would be made after the deal with the country is official. In the past three months, piracy attacks have averaged about 12 to 14 a month off the east coast of Africa. As of mid-January, the attack numbers are already at the average of the past three months, according to Gortney. ""That [number] should tell you that we're not -- we're not being 100 percent successful on the deterrence of the attempt. And that's where we have to go after,"" Gortney said. The United States is expecting other nations to join the anti-piracy task force, but at the moment, the United States is the only country in the task force with just three ships off of the waters of Somalia. There are ships from some European and Asian countries patrolling the waters independently as well, primarily guarding cargo ships from their own countries. Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau.  See how pirate attacks peaked in 2008 » . Pirating off of Somalia has increased during the past four to five years as fishermen from Somalia realize that pirating is more lucrative than fishing. Additionally, pirates are able to get away with the crimes because of the lack of government and overall lawlessness in the country. Gortney said statistically the chances of ships being pirated off of Somalia less than one percent, but it won't be stopped until piracy is ""disincentivized.""","Gortney: No working Somali government, country willing to detain, try accused pirates .

"LONDON (CNN) -- Iran offered to stop attacking coalition troops in Iraq nearly four years ago in an attempt to get the West to accept Tehran's nuclear program, a British diplomat told the BBC in an interview aired Saturday. John Sawers, British ambassador to the U.N., told BBC of Iran approaching Western nations with offer. ""The Iranians wanted to be able to strike a deal whereby they stopped killing our forces in Iraq in return for them being allowed to carry on with their nuclear program -- 'We stop killing you in Iraq, stop undermining the political process there, you allow us to carry on with our nuclear program without let or hindrance,"" said John Sawers, now the British ambassador to the United Nations, in the documentary, ""Iran and the West: Nuclear Confrontation."" The United States and other Western nations believe Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program, but Iran says it is developing nuclear capability to produce energy. Iran also has been accused of sponsoring terrorists and supplying weapons to Iraqi insurgents. The latter prompted a warning from the United States that such behavior by Tehran ""would be regarded by us as enemy action,"" Philip Zelikow, a State Department counselor, told the BBC. Then, Iran began shopping its offer around Europe, Sawers said. Sawers, Britain's political director at the time, reveals the behind-the-scene talks from 2005 -- when roadside bombing against British and American soldiers in Iraq peaked -- were held with British, French and German diplomats at hotels in London, Paris and Berlin. ""And then we'd compare notes among the three of us,"" Sawers told the BBC. The British government dismissed the offer and Iran's nuclear enrichment program restarted once again, the BBC reports . Iran has denied offering any such deal and reiterated its position Saturday. ""Iran's high officials have repeatedly stated that Iran has not had any part in attacks against American and British forces, and there is no evidence to support these baseless accusations,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi said, according to the semi-official Mehr News Agency. Interviews with top brass from former President Bush's administration and British envoys indicate that Iran and the West had neared agreements several times in the past few years, but never reached success. Nick Burns, who was in charge of the Bush administration's State Department policy with Iran, said taking a tough approach with Iran didn't seem effective. ""We had advocated regime change,"" Burns told the BBC. ""We had a very threatening posture towards Iran for a number of years. It didn't produce any movement whatsoever."" The documentary aired a day after the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security released a report stating that Iranian scientists have reached ""nuclear weapons breakout capability."" The report analyzed the finding of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). However, an IAEA official who asked not to be named cautioned against drawing such dramatic conclusions from the data, saying Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium (HEU) in order to be weapons-grade material. That hasn't been done, the official said. Meanwhile, Iran's relationship with the West continues to be strained, though both sides have indicated interest in holding direct talks. President Obama, in his first prime-time news conference held earlier this month, said the United States is looking for opportunities for ""face-to-face"" talks with Iran after an absence of diplomatic ties for nearly three decades. ""There's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight,"" he said. And Iran's powerful parliament speaker and former nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, has called the Obama administration ""an exceptional opportunity for Americans.""","Iran approached diplomats with offer nearly four years ago, BBC told .

"(CNN) -- Diplomats edged closer to finding a way to end the fighting in Gaza on Friday as the United States and Israel signed an agreement designed to stop arms smuggling into the Palestinian territory. Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni says European nations and NATO will be helping with anti-smuggling efforts. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni signed a memorandum of understanding that calls for an international effort to stem the flow of weaponry and explosives. The agreement outlines a plan to share information and provide technical assistance to stop the smuggling of arms to the militants. The meeting in Washington was one of several diplomatic moves afoot to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The diplomatic moves came as Israel's offensive against Hamas militants continued, with Israeli airstrikes pounding the northern and southern sections of Gaza.  Watch more on the latest fighting in Gaza » . U.S. and Israeli diplomats said the agreement includes intelligence coordination to prevent arms from Iran from entering Gaza, maritime efforts to identify ships carrying weaponry, and the sharing of U.S. and European technologies to discover and prevent the use of weapons-smuggling tunnels. Rice said the steps spelled out in the memorandum will ""stem the flow of weapons and explosives into Gaza."" ""The United States is reaching out to its partners as well. Together, the steps that we and other members of the international community can take will contribute to a durable cease-fire,"" said Rice, noting that ""there must be an international consensus that Gaza never be used as a launching pad against Israeli cities."" Livni said that ending the fighting in Gaza won't be ""achieved by agreements with terror, but with effective arrangements against it"" -- a unified effort by the international community. She said a ""durable"" end to hostilities requires a stop to weapons smuggling into Gaza. ""We have agreed on a series of actions with regional and international players in order to complement Egyptian actions and end the flow of weapons to Gaza,"" Livni said. She said European nations and NATO would be helping with the anti-smuggling efforts. The Bush administration has been consulting with the Barack Obama team about the memorandum of understanding and efforts to forge a cease-fire. Rice has spoken with President-elect Obama, incoming Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and incoming National Security Adviser James Jones. Israel on Thursday dispatched senior Defense Ministry official Amos Gilad to Cairo to discuss a cease-fire proposal, and Gilad was continuing talks in Cairo. A Hamas delegation is also in the Egyptian capital, talking with leaders there who are trying to hammer out a temporary truce. Egypt has hosted peace talks with leaders from Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and has acted as an intermediary between Hamas and Israel. Arab and regional diplomats and leaders also have been meeting to deal with the crisis, but there is no unified Arab stand. The state of Qatar held an emergency summit Friday in an attempt to find a unified Arab voice on Gaza. The meeting brought together some regional leaders, including the presidents of Iran and Syria and the leader of Hamas, Khaled Meshaal. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the Palestinian Authority were not in attendance. They plan to attend the regular annual Arab League summit scheduled for next week in Kuwait devoted to Gaza. Arab League foreign ministers were meeting in Kuwait City on Friday and were planning the groundwork for next week's meeting. Six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates -- focused on Gaza at their emergency summit Thursday in Riyadh. Also, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon continued his trip through the region as part of the diplomatic effort to secure a truce. He has called for an immediate cease-fire between Hamas and Israel and said he is encouraged that the Egyptian government is trying to broker a truce. He met with Israeli officials Thursday and condemned an Israeli strike that damaged the U.N. Relief and Works Agency's compound in Gaza City, sparked a massive fire and injured three people. Once the fighting stops, the two sides can ""discuss how to make this cease-fire durable and sustainable,"" he said.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Nearly 1,300 computers in more than 100 countries have been attacked and have become part of a computer espionage network apparently based in China, security experts alleged in two reports Sunday. The network was discovered after computers at the Dalai Lama's office were hacked, researchers say. Computers -- including machines at NATO, governments and embassies -- are infected with software that lets attackers gain complete control of them, according to the reports. One was issued by the University of Toronto's Munk Centre for International Studies in conjunction with the Ottawa, Canada-based think tank The SecDev Group; the second came from the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. Researchers have dubbed the network GhostNet. The network can not only search a computer but see and hear the people using it, according to the Canadian report. ""GhostNet is capable of taking full control of infected computers, including searching and downloading specific files, and covertly operating attached devices, including microphones and web cameras,"" the report says. The discovery of GhostNet grew out of suspicions that the office of the Dalai Lama had been hacked. His staff sent a foreign diplomat an e-mail invitation to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader, but before the Dalai Lama's people could follow up with a phone call, ""the diplomat's office was contacted by the Chinese government and warned not to go ahead with the meeting,"" according to the Cambridge report.  Watch CNN's John Vause report on the network » . An investigation resulted in both reports. Both found links to computers in China, but the researchers did not conclude who they thought was behind the ""malware,"" or malicious software. ""Chinese cyber espionage is a major global concern ... [b]ut attributing all Chinese malware to deliberate or targeted intelligence gathering operations by the Chinese state is wrong and misleading,"" according to the Canadian report titled, ""Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network."" ""The sheer number of young digital natives online can more than account for the increase in Chinese malware,"" it adds. But the report also points out that China is among a handful of countries,  including the United States, Israel and United Kingdom, that are ""assumed"" to have considerable computer espionage capabilities. Attempts by CNN to contact the Chinese government in Beijing and its American embassy and consulate offices were unsuccessful on Sunday, as the offices were closed. However, a spokesman for the Chinese consulate in New York dismissed the idea China was involved when speaking to The New York Times. ""These are old stories and they are nonsense,"" Wenqi Gao told the Times. ""The Chinese government is opposed to and strictly forbids any cyber crime."" Hackers gained access to computers in the Dalai Lama's office by tricking computer users into downloading e-mail attachments that had been carefully engineered to appear safe, according to the authors of the Cambridge report, titled, ""The Snooping Dragon: Social-malware Surveillance of the Tibetan Movement."" ""The attackers took the trouble to write e-mails that appeared to come from fellow Tibetans and indeed from co-workers,"" according to the report, authored by Shishir Nagaraja and Ross Anderson. Once the attackers gained an initial foothold, ""they also stole mail in transit and replaced the attachments with toxic ones,"" the report adds. The Dalai Lama investigation led to the discovery of hundreds more infected machines in locations from The Associated Press in Britain and Deloitte and Touche in New York, to the ministries of foreign affairs in Indonesia, Iran and the Philippines. The office of the prime minister of Laos was also snared, as was a single non-secure computer at NATO, according to the Canadian report. Infected computers ""checked in"" with control servers as early as May 2007 and as recently as March 12 of this year, the report adds. Attempts by CNN to verify the reports' allegations with NATO, the Laotian government and the Dalai Lama's organization in India were not immediately successful on Sunday. The attack has broader implications, Nagaraja and Anderson warn, since a single person could carry out a similar one. ""Even a capable motivated individual could have carried out the attacks we describe here,"" they say. The computer systems of businesses are almost certain to be hacked by similar means, if they have not been already, the experts claim. ""Social malware will be used for fraud, and the typical company really has no defense against it,"" since it is so expensive and inconvenient, for example, to keep sensitive information or processes on computers with no Internet access. ""We expect that many crooks will get rich before effective countermeasures are widely deployed."" The Information Warfare Monitor Web site, where the Canadian report was released, was down Sunday afternoon. GhostNet is not affiliated with GhostNet Inc., a business technology company.","Researchers: Dalai Lama's office, NATO, governments among targets .

"(CNN) -- The e-mail arrived from Uzbekistan on February 26. It was titled ""Bad News."" Abdul Dadahanov had intended to study business, but changed his mind after 9/11, his academic adviser said. ""Dear Mama Judy,"" a young woman named Aziza Dadahanov wrote in shaky English. ""Very very bad news!!! Abdul is given 8 years of prison. Today was the verdict. Now i feel myself very bad. And i can't write now. I am shocked."" ""It was like being kicked in the stomach,"" recalled Judy Skartvedt, a retired flight attendant living in Easton, Connecticut. She knew Dadahanov's husband, Abdul Dadahanov, as an Uzbek exchange student who had wanted to help heal people after the 9/11 attacks. She thought of him as an open-minded Muslim whom her family had hosted when he came on a scholarship to study at Fairfield University in 2001. ""We were totally shocked that someone like Abdul could be arrested for anything,"" Skartvedt said. ""We haven't stopped worrying about his safety."" The 32-year-old faces eight years in a labor camp for participation in what the Uzbekistan government says is an extremist religious organization, according to Forum 18, a religious freedom watchdog organization . The group says that Uzbek security forces arrested Dadahanov and four other men -- Bakhrom Ibrahimov, Davron Kabilov, Rovshanbek Favoyev and Botyrbek Eshkuziyev -- last summer after the men had written for an Islamic journal called Irmoq. The National Security Service reportedly claimed the magazine was ""sponsored by a Turkish radical religious movement."" Officials from the Embassy of Uzbekistan in Washington have refused to comment on the case. Forum 18 says Dadahanov and the four other Uzbek men were convicted of ""dissemination of information and materials containing ideas of religious extremism, separatism and fundamentalism, calls for pogroms or violent eviction of individuals aimed at creating panic among the population."" Human rights organizations say the convictions appear to be part of a broader crackdown in the former Soviet republic, targeting members of ""Nurchilar,"" a moderate Muslim movement of Turkish origin, which follows the writing of a 19th-century Sufi Muslim theologian. ""Unfortunately this is not an unusual case,"" said Igor Vorontsov, a researcher with Human Rights Watch in St. Petersburg. ""The [Uzbek] government has persisted in its persecution of independent Muslims."" Thousands of miles from the Republic of Uzbekistan, news of Dadahanov's jail sentence has stunned academics and Christian community leaders in Connecticut. They fondly describe a committed social activist and observant Muslim, who rode between work and classes on a secondhand bicycle and spent more than a year distributing food to soup kitchens in one of America's poorer cities. ""He had a naive trust in the goodness of human beings,"" said Patty Jenson, an administrator at the Council of Churches of Greater Bridgeport. ""I am shocked. I know he is there [in prison] unjustly. What is happening is unjust."" ""He was a man of his word, he was gentle and kind,"" said Charlene Chambers, the director of King's Pantry, a nonprofit organization that distributes food to homeless people in Bridgeport. ""Our common bond was feeding people who can't feed themselves and clothing those people who can't clothe themselves."" Dadahanov's academic adviser, Katherine Kidd, said the young Uzbek originally intended to study business when he arrived at Fairfield University on a scholarship from the Open Society Institute of the Soros Foundation. That changed September 11, 2001. Kidd choked up as she recalled his visit to her office, hours after the terrorist attacks. ""He said, 'Dr. Kidd, I have to do something to tell people that this is not what Islam is about.' He said, 'I want to be part of things that are done here to bring healing to people after 9/11.' "" Dadahanov began working closely with Kidd's husband, Pastor John Kidd, who was a Lutheran minister and the executive director of the Council of Churches of Greater Bridgeport. Pastor Kidd helped Dadahanov tour churches and work with synagogues, giving lectures on his interpretation of Islam. Dadahanov also appeared before audiences dressed in traditional Central Asian attire, in an effort to spread cultural awareness about Uzbekistan. Advisers say the young Uzbek was inspired by his interaction with church and community groups. Gradually, he shifted his academic focus from business to grassroots community service and education reform. ""He would regularly say 'Wow, how can I do this in Uzbekistan, and make my country and my community better and stronger?'"" Katherine Kidd explained. Dadahanov helped establish a small prayer room for Muslim students at Fairfield University. He also launched a book drive, shipping secondhand books to Uzbekistan to help teach English in his home country. And he was eventually hired at the Council of Churches, and tasked with distributing Federal Emergency Management Agency funds to 26 feeding programs across Bridgeport. ""He wanted to be involved in the frontline programs,"" John Kidd said. ""Ultimately, it's sad that all these things he came to see in terms of how you build a community, how you take responsibility for the life of a community, is at least in part what put him at odds with the authorities in Uzbekistan."" When he returned to Uzbekistan in 2004 after two and a half years in Connecticut, Dadahanov set up an English-language school with friends. The school offered English lessons to young Uzbeks at an affordable price -- a remarkable achievement in a society in which the government controls almost all facets of the economy. There is little tolerance for independent grassroots activism in Uzbekistan. The country has had the same authoritarian president, Islam Karimov, since it won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The State Department's recently published 2008 human rights report states ""torture remain systemic in [Uzbekistan's] law enforcement ... human rights activists and journalists who criticized the government continued to be subjected to harassment, arbitrary arrest, politically motivated prosecution, forced psychiatric treatment and physical attack."" Uzbek security forces frequently target religious activists. ""The government has almost a paranoia of any independent religious activity, particularly those related to Islam,"" said Sean Roberts, a Central Asia expert at George Washington University. ""The Uzbek government tries to control the religious sector very similar to the way the Soviets did. They have a state Muslim board that oversees what is proper Islam - anything that falls out of that scope is seen as threatening and seditious."" The Uzbek government says it ""views the ensuring of human rights and freedoms of its citizens as its highest priority."" A statement posted on the Web site of the Embassy of Uzbekistan in Washington cited the passage of more then 120 laws and 60 international treaties aimed at improving the country's human rights record. The Uzbek government says it is making reforms of its judicial and penitentiary system, aimed at ""prosecuting and punishing for the use of torture and other forms of ill-treatment."" Dadahanov's former professors invited him to return on a scholarship to the United States after his arrest, and two families offered to house Dadahanov, his wife Aziza and young son Abdulrahman. Dr. Orin Grossman, Fairfield University's academic vice president, hoped the graduate school offer would allow Uzbek authorities to release Dadahanov. ""It obviously didn't work,"" he wrote in an e-mail to CNN. Accounts of appalling conditions in Uzbek prisons have worried Dadahanov's American friends, who remember how the slim Uzbek rode to barbecues on his bicycle, carrying a giant watermelon in a backpack as a gift. The hardest part has been trying to get information from Dadahanov's family in Tashkent. ""The government is tapping their phone and tracking their e-mail,"" Katherine Kidd said. ""We're pretty much sure neither of those is secure from the government.""","Abdul Dadahanov jailed in Uzbekistan, accused of extremist religious activities .

"(CNN) -- Watch out! Lock up your loved ones! Another bloated, over-produced, high-concept monstrosity has escaped from the labs at Dreamworks Animation, and it's out to devour your kids. Susan, aka ""Ginormica,"" has to save the world in ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" But don't be too alarmed. ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is relatively harmless -- a toothless satire with a knee-jerk feminist theme and a sorry excuse for a plot. That sounds harsh, I know. Who doesn't want to see a 50-foot woman careening through San Francisco on skates that turn out to be automobiles -- the ultimate demolition roller derby? But think about that, just for a second. Roller skates work because they have fixed wheels. Try it with motorcars and you won't get very far. Is that too picky? Perhaps, but you wouldn't find Pixar playing so fast and loose with the laws of physics, and that kind of inattention to detail is typical of the lackadaisical storytelling here and in other Dreamworks animated features. (The talent pool for this one includes the directors of ""Shrek 2"" and ""Shark Tale"" and the writers of ""Kung Fu Panda"" and ""The Rocker,"" incidentally.) High concepts, top-notch voice talent and scattershot pop cultural references are no compensation for a coherent script. The XXXL lady in question -- dubbed ""Ginormica"" by her U.S. military guards -- starts out plain and petite Susan Murphy (voiced by Reese Witherspoon), until a meteorite hits her just minutes before she's supposed to tie the knot with unctuous chauvinist Derek (Paul Rudd). Her rapid growth spurt saves her from that particular fate worse than death, even if at first glance her new roommates don't look like much of an improvement. There's Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), a mad scientist who semi-advertently mutated with a bug; B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) an amorphous blue jelly-like blob who gets on just fine without a brain; Missing Link (Will Arnett), a gung-ho amphibian who's all mouth; and a giant dust mite called Insectosaurus who isn't voiced by anyone because he doesn't have anything to say. Sci-fi fans will have fun counting off the references to myriad classics -- ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""Invaders from Mars,"" ""The Fly,"" ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" ""The Blob,"" ""Mothra"" and ""Attack of the 50-Foot Woman,"" for starters -- and noting a few clever bits and pieces (Kiefer Sutherland, as General W.R. Monger, riffs on George C. Scott in ""Dr. Strangelove""). The trouble is, once the introductions are over, the filmmakers can only launch their desperately limp plot: The White House turns to these monstrous superheroes to save the planet from evil Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson), a squidlike creature with four eyes and twice as many legs, and a one-eyed tin robot to do his dirty work for him. Ginormica gets a kick-butt finale, and is a much stronger character -- in any number of ways -- than the movie's president. (In a genuinely witty casting touch he's voiced by Stephen Colbert.) That may be good politics or at least a sound marketing decision from the studio's perspective -- it's been awhile since a family animated feature produced a genuinely strong female character (unless you count ""Coraline,"" which was way too scary for my family) -- but Susan's self-esteem is an awfully long time coming. iReport.com: What do you think of 'Monsters vs. Aliens'? (Bizarrely -- and maybe it's just my imagination -- Gallaxhar bears a passing resemblance to President Obama. I wonder ... would that make Susan/Ginormica a surrogate for Sarah Palin or Hillary Clinton?) Visually, too, ""Monsters vs Aliens"" is undistinguished, although its shortcomings may be disguised if you seek out the 3-D version. Funny how 3-D movies tend to produce two-dimensional characters, with ""Coraline"" again the exception to the rule. Jocular and unpretentiously trashy, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" should be a lot of fun -- and it is, in places. But the truth is it's as hung up on itself as Susan's preening fiance. Hand on heart, I had a better time at ""Space Chimps."" ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" runs 94 minutes and is rated PG.

"(CNN) -- The Illinois state Senate on Monday began its impeachment trial against Gov. Rod Blagojevich without the governor present. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich denies any wrongdoing. Blagojevich said he expects lawmakers to vote to convict him. He is facing federal corruption allegations, including trying to trade or sell the Senate seat that became vacant after Barack Obama was elected president. The second-term Democratic governor has denied wrongdoing. Instead of attending the trial, Blagojevich hit the media circuit Monday. He appeared on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and ""The View,"" and was scheduled to give his first live prime-time interview Monday night on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" Speaking on ""Good Morning America,"" Blagojevich restated his complaints about what he called the ""unconstitutional"" impeachment trial, which he said ""denies me the right to call witnesses to defend myself and prove my innocence.""  Watch Blagojevich say he's done ""nothing wrong"" » . He said he is certain the Illinois Senate will vote to remove him from office and said he expects they will demand he step down ""relatively soon."" Earlier this month, the Illinois House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to impeach him. Blagojevich has said the vote was politically motivated. Under the Illinois Constitution, the House can vote to impeach an executive or judicial officer, but it is the Senate that conducts the trial. A two-thirds majority vote in the Senate is required to convict an officer of an impeachable offense. According to a federal complaint issued in December, Blagojevich and his chief of staff, John Harris -- who also was arrested on federal corruption charges -- were ""conspiring to obtain personal financial benefits"" for the governor by leveraging his sole authority to appoint a U.S. senator to replace Obama. ""I've got this thing and it's [expletive] golden,"" Blagojevich allegedly said in one recorded phone conversation, referring to his authority to appoint, according to the complaint. ""I'm just not giving it up for [expletive] nothing."" When asked about those alleged quotes, Blagojevich told ABC that federal prosecutors ""took snippets of conversations completely out of context."" ""When the whole story comes out, you'll see that the effort was to work to have a senator who can best represent Illinois,"" he said. Blagojevich has said his rights are being violated because he cannot challenge assertions in the House impeachment report.  Watch Blagojevich demand a fair trial » . Blagojevich also is asking for a change in a Senate trial rule that he said is preventing him from calling witnesses such as Valerie Jarrett, a confidant of Obama's; Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.; and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. Emanuel, claimed Blagojevich, agrees that he did not break any laws. State Sen. Matt Murphy, part of the nine-member committee that put the Senate trial rules together, called Blagojevich's complaints ""the theater of the absurd."" iReport.com: Do you trust your political leaders? ""What you've seen here ... is a cynical effort on the part of this governor that's perfectly consistent with his actions over the last six years, to try and further undermine the faith in this process that the people already have,"" Murphy said. He said the House prosecution team responsible for presenting the impeachment case to the Senate is operating under the same restrictions as Blagojevich with regard to calling witnesses. Murphy said on ""Good Morning America"" that U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald has asked both sides to ""defer to the criminal prosecution"" of Blagojevich and ""limit witnesses."" He noted that the governor has every right to submit ""positive statements that the governor says exonerate him"" -- such as those from Jarrett, Jackson and Emanuel -- as evidence in the Senate trial. ""We have lowered the standard for the admission of evidence for the governor to bend over backward to make this fair,"" Murphy said. ""The suggestion that this is somehow unfair to the governor is the most self-serving, ludicrous statement I have ever heard in my life. It couldn't be fairer for this guy."" Blagojevich missed deadlines this month for answering the impeachment charge and for filing a motion to dismiss, a spokesman for Illinois Senate President John Cullerton has said.","Impeachment trial proceedings for Illinois Gov.

"(CNN) -- High winds and heavy seas capsized a boat filled with African migrants heading for Europe off the coast of Libya Monday -- with more than 200 feared dead, the International Organization for Migration in Geneva, Switzerland, said Tuesday. A group of 227 migrants sits on a fishing vessel in Malta last month after arriving from Somalia. Jemini Pandya, IOM spokeswoman, said a boat carrying 250 people capsized north of the Libyan coast, with at least 20 confirmed dead and 23 rescued. Another boat with around 350 migrants was rescued. She said the rescued migrants were taken to two centers in the Libyan city of Tripoli. They included Egyptians, Somalis, Ghanians, Nigerians, Tunisians, Eritreans, Algerians, and Moroccans. There were also passengers from Asia -- Bangladeshis, Syrians, Indians, and Pakistanis, she said. She said there may be two other vessels in the Mediterranean carrying migrants. The initial reports that two vessels capsized proved to be incorrect, Pandya said.  Watch as migrants are feared drowned » . The vessels departed Sunday and were heading to southern Europe, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Monday. The migrants were believed to be headed for the Italian island of Lampedusa, where 37,000 landed last year, according to IOM spokesman Jean-Philippe Chauzy, who said many African migrants converge on Libya en route to Europe. Italian coast guards said an Italian tugboat working for an offshore oil companies in the Libyan seas picked up 350 people on Sunday and carried them to Libya with the help of the Italian military. The U.N. refugee agency, aware of the reports, said they came at the ""beginning of the smuggling season in the Mediterranean."" The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said details remain sketchy about what happened, but one boat among several vessels leaving Libya for Italy went down and hundreds are reported missing. It said the mishap occurred near the Libyan coast. It said some Egyptian nationals were rescued and bodies were recovered and that those aboard included Africans from the northern and the sub-Saharan regions. High Commissioner Antonio Guterres on Tuesday said that the tragedy reflects the desperation of people to escape poverty and persecution. ""This tragic incident illustrates, once again, the dangers faced by people caught in mixed irregular movements of migrants and refugees in the Mediterranean and elsewhere which every year cost thousands of lives,"" the U.N. agency said.","Hundreds feared dead after boat carrying African migrants capsized off Libya .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Leading British Cabinet minister Jacqui Smith's political future is in doubt after her husband admitted to paying for adult movies with taxpayers' money. Jacqui Smith surrounded by media outside her sister's home, whom she lives with in London. The home secretary's husband, Richard Timney, has apologized for the ""embarrassment"" he caused his wife, while she has promised to repay the money spent, including the £10 ($14) charge for the two films, the British Press Association reported. According to British media reports, Smith had not seen the videos and was ""mortified"" that they had ""mistakenly"" been paid for using her MP's expense account. Timney, who Smith pays £40,000 ($56,000) a year to be her office manager, submitted an expense claim last June for a £67 ($95) Virgin Media bill for television services in the couple's family home in Redditch, Smith's constituency, The Guardian newspaper reported. It reported the bill included two adult films, at a cost of £5 ($7) each, as well as two viewings of the heist movie ""Ocean's 13"" and one of ""Surf's Up,"" a children's film about a  penguin. The revelations could not come at a worse time for Smith, who is already being investigated by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards over her decision to claim at least £116,000 ($164,000) in second-home allowances for her family home since becoming an MP. She has claimed the second-home allowance for her family home while living with her sister in London. Smith designated her sister's house as her ""main"" residence, allowing her to claim the money for her family home. Conservative and opposition leader David Cameron described the latest news as ""deeply embarrassing"" for Smith. He said Smith had ""questions to answer,"" PA reported. ""I do not think this individual thing is the issue. I think she has got some questions to answer about the second home issue. It does seem to me pretty incredible to claim that the home where her family is, that is not her main home. ""I think this goes to a deeper problem, which is the second home allowance for MPs. The prime minister has ordered a review but he has sort of kicked it into the long grass. ""The review doesn't start until September, it is not going to report until after the next election. That is hopeless. We have got to get on with it."" Prime Minister Gordon Brown defended Smith. ""The home secretary is doing a great job and I do not think this issue should be allowed to detract from everything she is doing to ensure we protect the public and keep our neighborhoods safe,"" he said. ""She has done the right thing by taking steps to rectify the mistake that was made as soon as she became aware of it. ""This is very much a personal matter for Jacqui. She has made her apology, her husband has made clear that he has apologized."" Last week Brown ordered a review of the complex and opaque system of MPs' pay and allowances.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The BBC is refusing to broadcast a plea from leading British charities for aid to Gaza, saying the ad would compromise the public broadcaster's appearance of impartiality. Demonstrators protest at the BBC's central London offices Saturday against the broadcaster's decision. The decision prompted weekend protests in England and Scotland, with one group saying Sunday that 100 people had occupied the foyer of the BBC building in Glasgow, Scotland and would not leave until the BBC runs the ad. The Disasters Emergency Committee, which includes the British Red Cross, Oxfam, Save the Children and 10 other charities, plans to launch the ad on Monday. British broadcasters, led by the BBC, originally declined to air the appeal -- but in the face of criticism from government ministers and others, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 changed their minds. CNN was not approached to broadcast the ad, a DEC spokesman said. About 5,000 people demonstrated in front of the BBC's Broadcasting House in central London on Saturday over the broadcaster's stance. Seven people were arrested.  Watch protest against BBC decision » . In Glasgow, the London-based Stop the War Coalition said Sunday its supporters had moved into the foyer of the BBC building in what the group described as a peaceful protest. The group did not plan to move beyond the foyer but intended to stay there until the BBC changes its decision, said Keith Boyd, a coalition member who called CNN on Sunday. ""Primarily we are asking that the ad be shown,"" Boyd said. The BBC press office would not confirm whether its Glasgow office was being occupied or if protesters were even there. ""We don't comment on individual demonstrations,"" a statement from the BBC press office said. The BBC is standing by its decision to not air the ad, director general Mark Thompson wrote in a blog post on the corporation's Web site. ""We concluded that we could not broadcast a free-standing appeal, no matter how carefully constructed, without running the risk of reducing public confidence in the BBC's impartiality in its wider coverage of the story,"" he wrote Saturday. ""Inevitably an appeal would use pictures which are the same or similar to those we would be using in our news programs but would do so with the objective of encouraging public donations. The danger for the BBC is that this could be interpreted as taking a political stance on an ongoing story,"" Thompson said. ""Gaza remains a major ongoing news story, in which humanitarian issues -- the suffering and distress of civilians and combatants on both sides of the conflict, the debate about who is responsible for causing it and what should be done about it -- are both at the heart of the story and contentious,"" he added. The BBC, which is funded by an obligatory license fee paid by every British household with a television, is required by its charter to be impartial. It does not carry commercial advertising but does broadcast charity appeals. The DEC is ""disappointed that the BBC declined to support the Gaza appeal,"" the spokesman told CNN. ""It might limit the reach of our key message to the general public."" The spokesman, who asked not to be named, said the BBC had to make its own decision about impartiality. ""That is a decision they must make. We have no view on that subject,"" he said. Many readers of Thompson's blog post did have a view, however. The statement got hundreds of comments, most of them critical of the BBC. A commenter who signed in as ""bully--baiter"" said the BBC was taking a side, no matter what it did. ""Sorry Mr. Thompson but you cannot have it both ways. If deciding to accede to the DEC request would be seen as political then deciding not to accede to it is also political. Don't insult me with your disingenuous attempts to suggest it is otherwise,"" the commenter wrote. Other commenters simply rejected Thompson's position out of hand. ""I think the reasons for blocking help for a grave humanitarian disaster are simply astounding,"" ""brit--proud"" wrote. ""How can simply bringing food, medicines and homes to hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians be seen as political impartiality? How stupid do the BBC think the British public are?"" But the corporation had its defenders as well. ""The last thing I want to do, is fund the BBC to broadcast propaganda,"" ""SternG"" wrote: ""There's no way I will pay the BBC to air the DEC's politically-motivated 'appeal' for Gaza. Gaza is run by a government which is internationally recognized as a terrorist group, including by the EU. There is no doubt that some aid/fund will be 'procured' by Hamas. ... Good decision BBC."" British broadcasters have refused to air some previous DEC appeals, the umbrella organization's spokesman said. A planned 2006 appeal for aid to victims of the war in Lebanon was scrapped because ""there were genuine concerns, shared by the aid agencies, about the deliverability of aid."" Thompson cited doubts about whether DEC members could get aid to Gaza as a secondary reason for declining to take the ad.","NEW: Protesters occupy part of BBC building in Scotland, group says .

"(CNN) -- Academy Award-winning composer Maurice Jarre, who scored movies including ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" among others, died Sunday from cancer in Los Angeles. He was 84. Movie composer Maurice Jarre pictured at the Berlin International Film Festival last month. Jarre enjoyed an illustrious career, working with Hollywood directing legends including John Huston, Alfred Hitchcock and, most notably, David Lean. Fellow French composer Alexandre Desplat, who interviewed Jarre for The Screening Room at the Berlin International Film Festival last month, told CNN Monday: ""Maurice was an immense artist, an incredible symphonist, a magician of the melody and a benevolent human being.""  Watch tribute to Maurice Jarre » . Jarre won Oscars in 1963 and 1966 for his collaborations on the Lean movies ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"" respectively. He then mustered a further six Oscar nominations but his third award came once again through a further collaboration with Lean on "" A Passage to India"" in 1984. He then swapped orchestral composition to become a pioneer of electronic scoring, working on the music for, among others, ""Ghost,"" ""Witness,"" ""Dead Poet's Society"" and ""Fatal Attraction."" At the same time his son Jean-Michel Jarre became one of the world's best known electronic musicians with global hits such as ""Oxygene"" and huge outdoor concerts. His final movie composition was for the 2000 film ""I Dreamed of Africa."" Jarre's career included symphonies, ballet and theatre but it was for his 150 film scores that he was presented with an honorary Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival last month - almost half a century after producer Sam Spiegel hired him to work on ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Festival director Dieter Kosslick said in a statement late last year: ""Film composers often are in the shadows of great directors and acting stars. It's different with Maurice Jarre; the music of 'Doctor Zhivago,' like much of his work, is world-famous and remains unforgotten in the history of cinema."" Speaking in Berlin to double-Oscar nominee Desplat -- who himself scored ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""The Queen"" -- Jarre said: ""I never really had a 'bust-up' with a good director. A good director will always find an intellectual understanding. And that's what was great - I had an opportunity with all these people. I don't think I can say that I ever worked with a bad director."" But Jarre also said that directing legends of the rank of Huston and Hitchock had disappeared and no longer existed, adding: ""The only problem is now, there is more and more bad music that goes 'dang dang dang dang dang...' So...it's better to turn off the music, and listen to a concert of Mozart."" Senior producer Neil Curry and associate producer Lidz-Ama Appiah contributed to this report.","Maurice Jarre won three Oscars during his career, all for scoring films by David Lean .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The latest 3-D animated movie involves the possible extinction of the human race and features a mad scientist with the head of a cockroach, a prehistoric half-ape/half-fish, a 50-foot-tall woman (OK, 49-foot-11), and a blue brainless blob named B.O.B. The Missing Link, Ginormica, the blue blob B.O.B. and Insectosaurus dominate ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" And they're the good guys. Reese Witherspoon leads the cast of ""Monsters vs. Aliens,"" providing the voice of Susan, who is hit by a glowing meteorite on her wedding day. Before long she's grown into the biggest thing around. The short-statured Oscar winner relished the chance to play not only a giant, but also a role model. ""I was walking with my son and my daughter the other day, and I was like 'Who's your favorite superhero?' "" Witherspoon said. ""And my son was like ... 'Batman, Superman, Spiderman,' and he could name 20 guy superheroes. ""And so I said to my daughter, 'Who's your favorite superhero?' And she goes 'I don't know, the girl in the back of the Justice League? I can't remember her name.' "" So the idea of showcasing a female superhero, Witherspoon said, has the actress ""really excited."" Kiefer Sutherland, who plays General W.R. Monger, sees the film as helping kids embrace their diversity. ""I love the idea that they were gonna make a film that was going to tell young people that it's all right to be different,"" Sutherland said. His military veteran character captures Susan, renames her ""Ginormica,"" and locks her up with the other ""monsters"" he's collected over half a century. ""And not only is it all right to be different, that one thing that may make you feel awkward about being different might be your greatest asset."" Those assets become apparent when an alien invader (voiced by Rainn Wilson of ""The Office"") decides he wants Earth, and the monsters -- Ginormica, Dr. Cockroach (""House"" star Hugh Laurie), The Missing Link (Will Arnett), and the gelatinous B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) -- are called upon to save the planet. The film, which also features the voices of Stephen Colbert and Paul Rudd, opens Friday. Most of the cast had previous experience in animation voiceover -- last year, Rogen was featured in ""Kung Fu Panda,"" and he and Arnett were heard in ""Horton Hears A Who!"" -- but it was the first time for Wilson. ""They called me and they said 'They're interested in you for this, playing an evil alien warlord,' and I was like 'Where do I sign?' "" he said with a chuckle. It was a welcome change of pace for Sutherland, who recorded his voice tracks for ""Monsters"" while he was filming the uber-intense ""24."" ""So, for five days a week I'm very serious in the '24' world, and then for five hours on the weekend I got to be 5 years old and just play a cartoon character"" -- a character he says he saw as a combination of R. Lee Ermey's intense gunnery sergeant in ""Full Metal Jacket"" and that 'toon terror, Yosemite Sam. ""We combined these voices and the producers laughed, which is generally a pretty good sign,"" Sutherland said. Sutherland may have been inspired by the classics, but the 3-D aspect of ""Monsters"" is as modern as movie technology gets. Under the command of DreamWorks Animation chief Jeffrey Katzenberg (whom Witherspoon and Sutherland respectfully called ""Mr. Katzenberg""), the film was conceived from the beginning as a 3-D project. One early scene uses the process to bounce a paddleball out at the audience, but for the most part, the effect is used immersively, to bring viewers into the ""Monsters"" world. ""You really feel like you're there, like you're a part of this thing,"" said Arnett, ""not in a way that's gratuitous and to just sort of show off, but really so that the viewer can be an active participant in the movie."" While film technology continues to advance, some things never change. As Susan is still trying to get used to her new size and powers, she finds herself simultaneously battling an alien robot and trying to save dozens of people trapped in their cars on the Golden Gate Bridge while her male cohorts mostly just stand around. One tries to encourage her by calling ""You're doing it!"" to which Susan snaps back, ""I'm doing everything!"" ""The quintessential cry!"" Witherspoon said. ""The female war cry! That's one of my favorite lines."" iReport.com: Does 3-D make you more likely to see a movie? Of course, it's hardly a spoiler to reveal that -- eventually -- Susan not only bonds with the rest of her motley crew, but also gains the self-confidence to see the positives in her accidental enormousness. As Wilson, the film's villain, noted, ""It's a coming-of-age tale -- for the monster inside of each one of us."" And, perhaps, it will give some little girls a superhero to look up to.","""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is about motley group of misfits who team up to defeat alien .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- Prosecutors in Florida are taking a new look at the 2007 death of Anna Nicole Smith to see if recent evidence that California investigators gathered might cause them to open an inquiry. Prosecutors in Florida are reviewing evidence gathered in California for a probe into Anna Nicole Smith's death. Howard K. Stern -- Smith's longtime partner and attorney -- and two doctors were charged this month in California with conspiring to furnish drugs to Smith before her fatal overdose. ""Our prosecutors have met with representatives of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the California Department of Justice and discussed the evidence they have turned up in their investigation,"" said Ron Ishoy, a spokesman for Broward County State Attorney Michael Satz. ""We are now examining that evidence to see where it might lead in relation to Ms. Smith's death here in Broward County in 2007."" The Broward County state attorney's office never opened a probe into Smith's death but assisted the Seminole police in its investigation in the days afterward. Smith, 39, was pronounced dead February 8, 2007, after being discovered unconscious in her hotel room at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino near Hollywood, Florida. A coroner said she died from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. Officials said both prescription and over-the-counter drugs were found in Smith's system, including three anti-depressant or anti-anxiety drugs. Human growth hormone and chloral hydrate, a sleep medication, also were found in toxicology tests, officials said. Stern and Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor were charged in California with several felonies, including conspiring to furnish controlled substances, unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and obtaining fraudulent prescriptions from June 2004 through January 2007 -- only weeks before Smith's death. Kapoor and Eroshevich also were charged with obtaining a prescription for opiates by ""fraud, deceit or misrepresentation."" And each was charged with one count of obtaining a prescription for opiates by giving a false name or address, prosecutors said. ""Anna was the center of a cruel tabloid feeding frenzy,"" Eroshevich's attorney, Adam Braun, told CNN in a statement after his client was charged. ""In the face of this, Dr. Eroshevich did her best to help the patient while protecting what little privacy Anna had left. Any actions were done with the patient's well-being in mind and were certainly not criminal.""  Watch allegations over photos and the doctor » . California Attorney General Jerry Brown said the doctors and Stern devised a plan to use fake names so Smith could be prescribed ""thousands of pills."" The former Playboy playmate and reality TV star was drugged ""almost to the point of stupefaction,"" Brown said. ""The quantity of the drugs, the variety of the drugs, the combination at any given point, and her continuing to use that -- that, to a professional, is clear evidence of addiction,"" Brown said Friday.

"(CNN) -- It's the season of brackets, beer and, of course, basketball. Duke Blue Devils fans cheer on their team at the ACC Tournament in Atlanta, Georgia. Come mid-March, the country falls sick with college basketball fever, and the NCAA Tournament is all the talk. As men's college basketball comes to a close with the last game April 6, fans are anxiously watching to see who will claim victory in this year's national championship game. More than a century after James Naismith invented basketball at a YMCA training school in Massachusetts, the sport continues to captivate millions of fans. Over the years, college basketball has sparked great dedication among its fans, from those who camp out for three months for a ticket to those who attended games before they could read. CNN, with the help of experts at the NCAA, chose a handful of basketball towns filled with great fans, rich traditions and history that make these places worth a visit. 1. Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill . College basketball is deeply rooted in North Carolina culture, thanks to the success of the men's teams at the University of North Carolina and Duke University. The epic rivalry between Duke's Blue Devils and North Carolina's Tar Heels draws in so many fans that some sports experts say it is partly responsible for reviving the waning college basketball viewership in the first half of this decade. Visitors will find that Duke basketball fans don't shower their support only on game day. At Duke University -- seeded No. 2 in the East -- student fans, dubbed the Cameron Crazies, are so eager to snare one of the 1,200 first-come-first-serve spots in the Cameron Stadium student section that they camp out for up to three months for the infamous North Carolina-Duke matchup. The grassy tenting area outside the basketball arena, known as Krzyzewskiville, is named after Coach Mike Krzyzewski, who has been named National Coach of the Year 12 times. ""It's so easy to become enthralled with the culture of Duke basketball,"" said Joel Burrill, a senior who headed up the tenting efforts this year. Outside the stadium, visitors will discover plenty of Blue Devil spirit off-campus in Durham, a former tobacco town. Satisfaction Restaurant and Charlie's Pub & Grille are among the favorite hot spots where visitors will discover student and local fans watching the games. About a 20-minute drive from Durham is the historic town of Chapel Hill, home to the University of North Carolina, which was seeded No. 1 in the South this year. The school has a strong record of basketball success, appearing in more than 40 NCAA tournaments. It is also the college team of professional basketball legend Michael Jordan. Adam Lucas, publisher of Tar Heel Monthly, has been decked in baby blue Carolina gear since he was a child. He even skipped school so he could attend the games with his parents, both Tar Heel alums. ""It's not just a sport,"" he explained. ""It's the number one thing talked about during this part of the year. You'll have trouble holding a conversation in Chapel Hill in March if you don't know the basics of Carolina basketball."" If visitors can't get one of the coveted tickets to watch the game in the Dean E. Smith Center, aka the Dean Dome, there is plenty to do in the quaint city of Chapel Hill. Visitors can walk to Franklin Street, the heart of town, where eateries, shops and sports bars are ready to embrace UNC fans. They can also visit the 8,000-square-foot Carolina Basketball Museum, located on campus, which holds more than 450 interactive displays, memorabilia and photos documenting a basketball program that began more than a century ago. 2. The University of Kansas in Lawrence . To understand the fan devotion for the defending national champions and a Midwest No. 3-seeded team this year, one must make a trip to Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas. The Jayhawks' indoor arena is old-school -- smaller than most college basketball stadiums -- built in the 1950s and named in honor of revered former Coach Forrest C. ""Phog"" Allen. In 1952, ""Phog"" led the men's basketball team to its first NCAA victory. The energy from thousands of fans in Allen Field House is contagious. In addition to the ""Rock Chalk Jayhawk"" chant, KU students are famous for their clever antics against the other teams, particularly their longstanding rivals at the University of Missouri. But if you can't get a ticket during the regular season, check out the Booth Family Hall of Athletics, a 26,000-square-foot museum adjacent to the stadium. The museum, which opened about three years ago, houses artifacts and information about the history of KU athletics, including the men's basketball team. Visitors can head to colorful Massachusetts Street, the main drag in downtown Lawrence. The street is lined with plenty of restaurants and bars catering to Jayhawks followers on game day. When Kansas beat Memphis to clinch the national championship last year, more than 100,000 fans poured into the street, university officials say. ""People who come [to Lawrence] never want to leave,"" said Jennifer Sanner, a 1981 alumna and editor of Kansas Alumni magazine. ""And if you're a basketball fan, that's all the better."" 3. Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana . Sure, the Hoosiers didn't have a stellar season after going 6-25, and they didn't make it to the NCAA Tournament. After Kelvin Sampson resigned as coach in February over allegations that he had violated NCAA recruiting standards, the team lost many of its top players. Despite this, college basketball in Bloomington, Indiana, remains sacred, devout Hoosiers fans say, and they believe that the men's team will be back in full force over the next few years. Indiana University has one of the top basketball programs in the country, winning five NCAA championships. The team was led for many years by hot-tempered but incredibly successful coach Bobby Knight. If you are lucky enough to get a ticket to see the Hoosiers play at their stadium, Assembly Hall, you will find droves of student fans. Assembly Hall holds one of the country's largest student sections, holding more than 8,000. Officials at Bloomington Indiana Visitors & Convention Bureau say basketball game days flood local restaurants and bars with students and local fans. The games tend to sell out, so be prepared to explore Bloomington. Most fans head to Kirkwood Avenue near campus and drop by Nick's English Hut, where the walls are covered with Hoosiers athletic photographs and gear, or Yogi's Grill and Bar to watch the game. ""Basketball is a religion in this state,"" said Zach Osterman, the men's basketball columnist at the university's student newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student. ""It goes way back before Bobby Knight. It's what people do up here."" 4. Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin . There is no football team at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. That means students and alumni are even more dedicated to the men's basketball team, they say. Marquette may be a Jesuit university with just over 11,000 students, but it boasts one of the highest attendance rates at basketball games in the country. Students at Marquette don't pitch tents like at Duke, but the games are so popular, some will bring their sleeping bags 10 hours before the game to get the best seat in the house . ""It's such a great feeling to know you can walk anywhere in the city when you have a Marquette shirt on a basketball day and people will talk to you about basketball,"" said Sarah Dembkowski, a sophomore at the university. ""It gives this city a bonding feeling."" Although the West region No. 6-seeded Golden Eagles lost to the University of Missouri in the tournament last week, a trip to the Bradley Center, where the Marquette men's basketball team plays (and where the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks play) is well worth the visit. Marquette students, called the Superfans, are famous for their peculiar behavior, dressing up in costumes to support their team and distracting opponents with oversized cutouts of celebrities' heads. On campus are several bars, including the Union Annex, that tout cheap beer pitchers and food specials for fans. Just several blocks from the university is downtown Milwaukee. On Water Street, where most of the fans crowd on game day, visitors can hang with the locals and enjoy a hub of sports bars, taverns and restaurants. 5. Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington . Gonzaga University officials call it the ""Gonzaga Effect"": This small private school in Spokane has qualified for the NCAA tournament for the 11th straight year. The Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team is an obscure team that seems to emerge from thin air each March. This year, the team entered the tournament seeded No. 4 in the South region. ""There have been a lot of one-and-done schools, who make a splash and disappear, but we've been able to sustain it,"" said Dale Goodwin, a spokesman for the university. Fans in ""the Kennel Club"" at Gonzaga go wild for basketball despite the school's smaller size. For more than 17 years of the Kennel Club's existence, the Bulldogs have won more than 75 percent of their games, including over 90 percent during the past eight seasons, according to the Gonzaga athletic department. Visitors will be delighted to watch the games in the school's arena, the $25 million McCarthey Athletic Center, which opened in 2004. Before the opening, the basketball team was playing in a glorified high school gym, university officials said. On Hamilton Street near the university, visitors will want to head to Jack & Dan's Tavern, which belongs to John Stockton, a former NBA and Gonzaga player. The Bulldog, which claims to have the best burgers in town, is also a popular hangout during the games. Meanwhile, the school is preparing to host the NCAA first- and second-round men's basketball tournament next March. The town of Spokane, tucked into eastern Washington, is excited to welcome visitors. A single event will probably bring in $2.75 million, according to the Spokane Regional Convention & Visitors Bureau.","Men's college basketball will end with NCAA championship game April 6 .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Suspected Taliban militants blew up a government-run school Monday in Pakistan's violence-plagued Swat Valley, bringing to 183 the number of schools destroyed since fighting began in the area six months ago, officials said. Students gather outside a destroyed school on January 17 in Kundar in Pakistan's Swat Valley. A day earlier, radical cleric Maulana Fazlullah threatened to kill more than four dozen government officials if they did not appear before him for opposing the Taliban. Local newspapers on Monday printed the list of 50 government officials and tribal elders whom Fazlullah has threatened with death. The boy's high school that was destroyed was located in Mingora, the valley's main city, said Sher Afzal Khan, an education officer for Swat. The attack occurred early Monday and no one was wounded. Swat Valley, located in North West Frontier Province, was once Pakistan's biggest tourist destination. It is situated near the Afghanistan border and about 186 miles (300 km) from the capital city of Islamabad. The valley boasted the country's only ski resort and was a draw for trout-fishing enthusiasts until it was overrun by militants, led by Fazlullah. He has launched a violent and deadly campaign to enforce Taliban-style fundamentalist Islamic laws throughout the province. The militants want to require veils for women and beards for men, and to ban music and television. The central government has long exerted little control in the area, but it launched an intense military offensive in late July to flush out militants. As retaliation for the military presence, the Taliban has carried out a series of deadly bombings, and has said the attacks will continue until the troops pull out. Elsewhere in the North West Frontier Province, a blast killed five people and wounded 15 others Monday morning, officials said. The bomb, planted on a bicycle, went off in the town of Dera Ismail Khan, said Mohammad Riaz of the province's police force. It killed shopkeepers and pedestrians, added the town's police chief, Abdul Rashid. CNN's Zein Basravi contributed to this report.","Blast targets boy's high school in Mingora, Swat Valley .

"(CNN) -- They feature characters such as hat-wearing cats, very hungry caterpillars, nice girls named Madeline and naughty boys named Max. ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"" by Eric Carle turns 40 this year, and 29 million copies of it have sold since 1969. Parents read them to their children, forming a powerful bond. Years later, those former children read these children's picture books to their children, and the thread between generations is extended yet again. ""Children's books live a long time because you always have children growing into them,"" says Pat Scales, president of the Association for Library Service to Children and a retired school librarian. ""And parents read [to their children] what was read to them."" The making of a classic is a strange alchemy of skill -- a good story, strong illustrations -- and luck. It's not easy to appeal to three audiences: publishers, parents and -- oh, yes -- children. Dr. Seuss' first children's book, ""And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,"" was rejected by more than 25 publishers before Vanguard Press put it out in 1937. Maurice Sendak's legendary ""Where the Wild Things Are"" (1963), though recognized with the Caldecott Medal -- the highest honor for a picture book -- was controversial for its drawings of monsters and its mischievous hero, Max. But almost all classics share some characteristics, says Alida Allison, a San Diego State University English professor and member of that California school's National Center for the Study of Children's Literature. ""Every one of them ... has the same reassuring pattern of 'home, away, home,' "" she says. ""The basic plot begins with a happy family situation. Then one extremely curious or transgressive child goes out on his or her own. And, no matter how 'bad' the child has been, he gets to come back home."" The child is welcomed back to the family and often gets something to eat, she adds. (One exception: Seuss' ""Mulberry,"" in which the adult condemns the child's sense of wonder -- but then, she adds, ""Dr. Seuss is in a world of his own."") The plot isn't just reassuring to children, she points out, but also reinforces the lessons of good parenting. ""If you think of all those stories, there's a loving parent ... allowing a transgressive kid a leash to investigate the world and come back,"" she says. And through the child's eyes, parents find their sense of wonder renewed, she adds. For children, it's all new -- the colors, the wordplay, even the plot -- and the more variety, the better. A child may be attracted by the rudimentary drawings of Eric Carle's ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar,"" the elasticity of Seuss' cats, Grinches and Oobleck, or the rich, almost otherworldly paintings of Chris Van Allsburg's ""The Polar Express."" And the language: Margaret Wise Brown's ""Goodnight Moon"" may seem to be nothing much, but it's as peaceful as a lullaby, Scales observes. And nothing succeeds like a book that has found its way into a child's heart. ""We know that kids return to their favorite books over and over again,"" Scales says. And then, of course, the story starts from the beginning. Allison, a published author herself, read a variety of books to her children when they were growing up: Dorothy Kunhardt's ""Pat the Bunny,"" Russell Hoban's ""Frances"" books. But at least one title earned its way into the rotation because of an older fan: Allison's husband. ""One of my husband's favorites growing up was 'The Pokey Little Puppy,' "" she says of the 1942 Little Golden Book by Janette Sebring Lowrey and Gustaf Tenggren. ""So he read that to our sons.""","Parents often read to their children what was read to them when they were young .

"(OPRAH.com) -- For all the majesty of the White House, the first lady has already infused it with a palpable ease; her presence makes the place feel open and approachable. When we sit down to talk, Michelle Obama seems as relaxed as she did when I first interviewed her and her husband in their Chicago apartment in 2004. ""This room has the best light in the house,"" she tells me as we settle in, shoes off, on a comfortable sofa. ""And there's pie here, too. The pie in the White House is dangerously good."" -- Oprah Winfrey . Michelle Obama is the first person to join Oprah Winfrey on the cover of O magazine . Oprah Winfrey: How are you a different woman today than you were when Barack Obama announced his candidacy in 2007? Michelle Obama: I'm more optimistic. More hopeful. It comes from traveling all over America and connecting with so many different people. And this was long before anyone thought Barack had a chance. This was the kindness of strangers. I think we should all have to get to know one another around kitchen tables. It changed me. It's helped me to give other people the benefit of the doubt. Winfrey: What did you see that changed you? Obama: I saw our shared values. We fundamentally want the same things for ourselves and for each other. We want our kids to be safe and to grow up with some resources and aspire to a slightly better life than ours. No one's looking for a handout. People just want fairness and opportunity. Oprah.com:The heart and mind of Michelle Obama . Winfrey: That's so good to hear. Because you know what? We live in an ""American Idol"" culture where it seems like everyone just wants to be in the spotlight. Obama: That's not the America I saw. People value their communities. They're rooting for one another. Even in places where I thought people wouldn't accept or relate to me, I always walked out feeling like, ""Wow -- that was fun."" That changed me. And it helped prepare me for this. Because I think if you're going to be first lady, you have to believe in the possibility of what this country stands for. You have to see it in action and know what you're working toward. Oprah.com: How Michelle gets unstuck . Winfrey: That's so interesting -- and it all came from sitting around kitchen tables. Speaking of which, did you change your diet during the campaign? Obama: When we first started running, my big concern was making sure we ate well on the road. So we started looking at our diet, trying to eliminate junk, getting seasonal fruits and vegetables that were grown locally. We walked the kids through reading labels. We talked about why one juice might be better than another. Winfrey: That's right. In addition to eating well, do you work out? Obama: Yes. There's a small gym here that has everything we need. I work out about four or five days a week -- and Barack does six. He's a workout zealot. Winfrey: Well, you look better than ever -- despite the rumors that you've got a baby bump. Obama: [Laughter.] I know -- I was like, ""Baby bump? As hard as I work on my abs?!"" Winfrey: Okay, so that's settled. Back to exercise. You do treadmill? Obama: I do treadmill, I do weights . Winfrey: I think anyone who saw you on the cover of Vogue knows you do weights. Those arms! Obama: I also do some jump rope, some kickboxing -- and I'd like to take up Pilates, if I could figure out whether there's time. After I had Malia, I began to prioritize exercise because I realized that my happiness is tied to how I feel about myself. I want my girls to see a mother who takes care of herself, even if that means I have to get up at 4:30 so I can do a workout. Winfrey: When you first told me that a few years ago, I was like, ""You get up at 4:30 to work out?"" Obama: Well, I just started thinking, if I had to get up to go to work, I'd get up and go to work. If I had to get up to take care of my kids, I'd get up to do that. But when it comes to yourself, then it's suddenly, ""Oh, I can't get up at 4:30."" So I had to change that. If I don't exercise, I won't feel good. I'll get depressed. Of course, it's easier to do it here, because I have much more support now. But I always think about women who don't have support. That's why work-family balance isn't just a policy conversation; it's about changing the expectations of who we have to be as women and parents. Winfrey: What you mentioned earlier is key: We have to ask for help. You can't do it all. It's impossible. Obama: That's a conversation I'd love for us to have as a society. How do we set expectations that are attainable? Winfrey: So what do you know for sure, Michelle Obama? Obama: I know that all I can do is be the best me that I can. And live life with some gusto. Giving back is a big part of that. How am I going to share this experience with the American people? I'm always thinking about that. Oprah.com: Read the entire exclusive interview .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Madonna's planned adoption of a Malawian girl will apparently go forward, despite earlier opposition from the girl's family, a reporter for the ITN television network told CNN Sunday. The pop star arrived in Malawi on Sunday. Madonna holds her adopted Malawian son, David Banda, in 2007. ""The family, I'm told, were admittedly reluctant to agree to this, but they've softened after learning more about this, the upbringing that Mercy will be given and they think perhaps it is in her best interest,"" ITN reporter Martin Geisler told CNN. The girl, who is about 4, is named Mercy James. Her uncle is scheduled to sign adoption agreement papers in a Malawian court on Monday, Geisler said. Geisler said Malawians' public opinion toward Madonna softened after she was interviewed by the Malawi Nation newspaper and released family photographs showing a happy David Banda -- a Malawian boy she adopted more than two years ago. ""The sense, I'm told, in Malawi after that, was, 'Well, the little boy looks well, he looks happy, he looks well looked after. Perhaps we shouldn't be so hard on her,'"" said Geisler. A British children's charity earlier asked the pop star to reconsider her reported plans to adopt a girl from the country. Save the Children spokesman Dominic Nutt said the child would be better off staying in Malawi than being raised by the recently divorced singer, who has three other children, including the adopted Malawian boy. ""The best place for a child is in his or her family in their home community,"" he said. ""Most children in orphanages have one parent still living, or have an extended family that can care for them in the absence of their parents."" Critics of the singer had argued she should donate money to orphanages in Malawi, rather than adopt another child. The charity argued that foreign adoptions should happen only if a child does not have any relatives, and all other options have been considered. The 50-year-old performer is a big supporter of Malawi. She made a documentary, ""I Am Because We Are,"" which highlighted poverty and AIDS and other diseases devastating Malawi's children. She also helps run a nonprofit group, Raising Malawi, which implements initiatives to help the needy in the southeastern Africa nation. On Sunday, Madonna toured the village of Chinkhota, assessing plans to build a school there and other possible Raising Malawi investments.

"WHITE OAK, Maryland (CNN) -- Seeking to remove unapproved drugs from the marketplace, the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday ordered nine companies to stop manufacturing narcotics whose therapeutic claims have not been proved. The FDA ordered nine companies to stop selling unapproved drugs marketed for pain relief. The FDA's warning letters notified the companies they may be subject to legal action if they do not stop manufacturing and distributing ""prescription unapproved products"" that include high-concentrate morphine sulfate oral solutions and immediate-release tablets containing morphine sulfate, hydromorphone or oxycodone. This action does not include oxycodone capsules. All of these drugs are used for pain relief and are forms of previously approved medications. The agency says this is not a recall, but is instead a warning to manufacturers. The companies have 60 days to pull these pain-relief drugs from the market. Distributors have 90 days to stop shipping them. If these drugs are not off the market by those deadlines, a company could face seizure of the narcotics and legal action. ""We estimate there are several hundred unapproved drugs out there,"" said Deborah Autor, director of the office of compliance within the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""We will continue to take aggressive action against those firms that do not have the required FDA approval for their drugs. Today's warning letters are another demonstration of our commitment to remove illegal, unproved drugs from the market."" Although the FDA does not know whether these drugs are unsafe, it has not approved them so cannot certify that the products are 100 percent safe and effective. ""Consumers have a right to expect that their drugs meet the FDA's safety and effectiveness standards,"" said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""Doctors and patients are often unaware that not all drugs on the market are backed by FDA approval. It is a high priority for the FDA to remove these products from the market because they may be unsafe, ineffective, inappropriately labeled, or of poor quality."" The FDA believes Americans have access to plenty of legal narcotics for pain relief and removing these unapproved drugs will not create a shortage. Consumers who may be concerned that they are taking any unapproved drug products should refer to the FDA's Unapproved Drugs Web page, which includes a list of manufacturers of these products. Those who find they are taking unapproved drugs should see their health care professionals for treatment options. Those companies receiving warning letters are Boehringer Ingelheim Roxane Inc., Columbus, Ohio; Cody Laboratories Inc., Cody, Wyoming; Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., Mahwah, New Jersey; Lannett Company Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Lehigh Valley Technologies Inc., Allentown, Pennsylvania; Mallinckrodt Inc. Pharmaceuticals Group, St. Louis, Missouri; Physicians Total Care Inc., Tulsa, Oklahoma; Roxane Laboratories Inc., Columbus, Ohio; and Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals Inc., Newport, Kentucky.","FDA warns manufacturers they have 60 days to pull unapproved drugs from market .

"(CNN) -- Former Italian international striker Christian Vieri has left Serie A side Atalanta by mutual consent, blaming constant jeering from the club's fans for his decision to leave. Veteran striker Vieri scored twice in nine appearances for Atalanta this season . The 35-year-old, back at his third stint with the Bergamo-based side, has failed to make an impression this season, and has become the focus of fans' frustrations after scoring just two goals in nine appearances. ""I want to thank Atalanta for the way they have dealt with me throughout the season and throughout my previous experiences wearing the black and blue shirt,"" said Vieri in a statement on the club's official Web site. Atalanta president Alessandro Ruggeri revealed the club had wanted the former Juventus, Inter Milan and AC Milan striker to stay but that his mind was made up. ""I'm disappointed as I'm sure everyone who loves football is. I don't know what he will do now, whether or not he will continue to play after this experience with Atalanta,"" said Ruggeri. ""I haven't spoken to him yet but my colleagues have and he was adamant, I don't think there was any way to make him stay."" Vieri has changed clubs 13 times since beconing a professional in 1991, playing for Italy's three biggest teams as well as Atletico Madrid in Spain and Monaco in France.

"(CNN) -- There is an old saying: Out of sight, out of mind. T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, has mentored at-risk students as part of his community service. But when rap star T.I. disappears from the hip-hop scene to complete his one-year, one-day sentence in federal prison, several music experts say, that won't be the case. The self-proclaimed ""King of the South"" will be sticking around, thanks to the success of his most recent album -- the double-platinum, Grammy-nominated ""Paper Trail,"" released last September -- his community service efforts and a reality show on MTV that has resonated with fans, they say. ""I think that if anything, it will gain him more fans and actually support his fan base, because he's talked about making a mistake,"" said Emil Wilbekin, editor in chief of Giant Magazine, which focuses on urban music and lifestyle and featured T.I. on its November 2008 cover. ""He's talked about taking care of the error of his ways."" T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, was sentenced to prison in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, last week on weapons charges. He will be taken into custody no earlier than May 19. In addition to serving prison time, the court asked T.I., 28, to pay a $100,300 fine on weapons charges related to purchasing machine guns and silencers. ""I would like to say thank you to some and apologize to others,"" Harris said at his sentencing Friday. ""In my life, I have been placed in the worst-case scenario and had to make the best of it."" Though he had been in legal trouble before, Harris' current situation began when he was arrested just hours before he was to perform at the BET Hip-Hop Awards in Atlanta. The rapper had provided a bodyguard with $12,000 to buy weapons. Harris was not permitted to own any guns, however, because he was convicted in 1998 on felony drug charges -- possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute -- in Cobb County, in suburban Atlanta. After his arrest, he entered a plea agreement, which federal authorities called unique because it allowed the rapper to remain out of prison for a year while he performed community service. Harris has already left a strong mark on the hip-hop genre, music experts say, which should position his career well when he is released. Harris had been named to the Forbes list of top-earning rappers, making an estimated $16 million in 2006. His fan base has expanded in the last year, with some of the growth due to ""Paper Trail,"" which has sold close to 2 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. This year, Harris went on to star in the MTV reality show ""T.I.'s Road to Redemption: 45 Days to Go,"" which chronicles his efforts to shave years off his sentence by completing his community service. The show features him talking to schools and community groups ""about how to avoid the trouble he now finds himself in,"" according to the network's Web site. To keep Harris in the spotlight, Jason Geter, part owner of Harris' record label Grand Hustle Entertainment, said the company will release a remixed copy of ""Paper Trail"" with five new songs this summer. He says Harris is shooting music videos set to be released when he is in prison. ""We come from a world if you don't work, you don't eat,"" Geter said. In addition to music, Harris' television production company Grand Hustle Productions, which produced the MTV reality show, is filming a second reality television series for MTV about celebrity racing. Also, in the heist film ""Takers,"" produced by Screen Gems and set for release in January 2010, Harris will appear alongside actor Matt Dillon. And Grand Hustle Entertainment officials say Harris' clothing line for young men, AKOO, will continue to be available in stores. Geter said that even in prison, his partner Harris will stay focused on his career. ""His [Harris'] music reflects his experiences,"" Geter said. ""He makes himself vulnerable, and that's why people like him so much. And people always love to hear a good drama."" Music experts say Harris' fans are an extremely dedicated group that will probably remain loyal until his release. They say that since fans have known for more than a year that their celebrity rapper would be facing jail time, they have had time to prepare for his departure and the decision doesn't come as a shock. Furthermore, experts say, one year is too short of a time to forget such a popular artist. ""This will give him some time to do some great thinking and creating,"" said Gail Mitchell, senior correspondent for R&B and hip-hop at Billboard. ""This time around, he is going to be OK."" Stacey Richman, a New York-based attorney who has worked with hip-hop artists such as Jay-Z, DMX and Ja Rule, said there is some threat that going to prison may cause a artist to burn out. But she adds that properly managed talent can help the artist survive. ""It comes down to where he stands in his career,"" said Richman, who has been practicing law for nearly two decades. Prison time can, perhaps ironically, serve to raise the profile of some hip-hop stars. A handful have been able to resume their careers at an even higher level after concluding their sentences. One of the most infamous examples involved 2Pac, also known as Tupac Shakur, who entered prison in 1994 on a sex abuse conviction. In 1996, after his prison stint, he released his album ""All Eyez on Me,"" which had sold 9 million copies by 1998, according to the Record Industry Association of America, a trade organization representing the U.S. recording industry. It was the first double-disc album of original material in hip-hop history, according to Billboard. More recently, Grammy-winning rapper Lil' Kim, also known as Kimberly Jones, is making her comeback on the popular ABC reality show ""Dancing With the Stars."" She served a year in prison after being convicted of perjury in a federal case involving her friends and a 2001 gunfight in New York City. She has not released an album since leaving prison. But incarceration doesn't promise success. Rapper Foxy Brown spent eight months in prison for violating her probation; her first post-incarceration album, ""Brooklyn's Don Diva,"" was given mediocre reviews and floundered in sales. It has sold only about 30,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Hip-hop artist Jamaal ""Shyne"" Barrow, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for two counts of assault and a list of other charges for involvement in a much-publicized New York City nightclub shootout with Puff Daddy and Jennifer Lopez, released an album while incarcerated in 2004, ""Godfather Buried Alive,"" that struggled to make a splash on the charts. Since his plea agreement, Harris has worked to differentiate his personal life from his rapper image. In multiple interviews with the media, he often mentioned that he is a father of five who lost a daughter to a miscarriage in 2008. His best friend died at a post-party shooting, which he says was the motivation for arming himself. ""Most often, things I have learned have been from trial and error,"" Harris told CNN. ""I knew no way to protect myself than to arm myself.""  Watch the rapper's interview with CNN's T.J. Holmes » . In Harris' latest single, ""Dead and Gone"" with Justin Timberlake, the lyrics indicate a changed Harris, trying to shed his previous image. He writes in the song that the ""old me is dead and gone."" The fan support for Harris continues to pour in since he received his sentence Friday. On Facebook.com, one fan, Hendrick Garner in Tupelo, Mississippi, wrote, ""Like you said this [is your] defining moment, and I think we all have had that moment, but it only makes us stronger.""","Rapper T.I. will be taken into custody no earlier than May 19 .

"(CNN) -- Cleveland Browns wide receiver Donte Stallworth was charged in Florida on Wednesday with killing a pedestrian while driving under the influence, a spokesman for the Miami-Dade County state attorney's office said. Cleveland Browns wide receiver Donte Stallworth has been charged with DUI manslaughter . Authorities charged Stallworth, 28, with DUI manslaughter in the death of Mario Reyes, spokesman Ed Griffith said. Stallworth is expected to surrender in court Thursday, Griffith said. The charge is a bondable offense, and bail is expected to be set at $200,000. If convicted, he could face up to 15 years in prison. According to Griffith, Stallworth's blood-alcohol level after last month's accident was measured at 0.126 percent, higher than the state's legal limit of 0.08 percent. Stallworth was drinking at a Miami Beach, Florida, club early March 14, court documents say. He later left the club and went to a Miami residence for about 45 minutes before leaving in his black Bentley GT at 7:07 a.m. He was driving east on the MacArthur Causeway, which connects Miami to the South Beach area of Miami Beach, when he struck Reyes, prosecutors said. Reyes, a construction worker, was crossing the eastbound lanes of the causeway. CNN affiliate WSVN reported that he was heading to a bus stop after leaving work. Reyes, 59, was struck by the right front and fender of the car and suffered critical  head, chest and abdominal injuries, according to an affidavit. He died a short time later at a hospital. Read the affidavit (PDF) Stallworth told the arriving officer, ""I hit the man lying in the road,"" the affidavit said. He said he had time to honk his horn and flash his headlights to alert Reyes, according to the documents. Police smelled alcohol on his breath, the documents said, and Stallworth provided a blood sample at the scene. Stallworth released a statement four days after the incident saying he and his family were ""grief-stricken."" ""My thoughts and prayers are with the Reyes family during this incredibly difficult time,"" he said. Among the expected conditions of Stallworth's bail are that he consume no alcohol or drugs, submit to random drug and alcohol testing, abide by a curfew between midnight and 6 a.m., surrender his passport and not drive, according to an agreement setting conditions of his release. He will be allowed to reside in Ohio and Florida as needed, but he must notify authorities 24 hours in advance when traveling. Stallworth and his attorney have been cooperating with authorities, Officer Deborah Doty, spokeswoman for Miami Beach police, said Wednesday. Stallworth, a former University of Tennessee player, has also played professionally for the New England Patriots, the New Orleans Saints and the Philadelphia Eagles.

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN)  -- Murder and justice have always been hallmarks of the ""Law & Order"" stable of TV shows, but never before have the fictional New York City crimes guided the show's detectives and attorneys to the United Nations -- until now. ""Law & Order: SVU"" co-star Christopher Meloni says the show's intent is to ""shine light in the dark places."" The U.N. recently opened the gates of its New York headquarters to the NBC Universal show ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" for the filming of an episode scheduled to air Tuesday. The taping marked the first time in its nearly 60-year history that the United Nations has allowed its iconic location to be used as a setting in a major network television production. Previously, the United Nations granted permission for the 2005 motion picture ""The Interpreter"" to film on location, making it the first feature film to shoot on the grounds of the U.N. Series stars Stephanie March, who plays Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Cabot, and Christopher Meloni, along with nearly 200 other cast and crew members, came to the U.N. on March 7 to film an episode revolving around child soldiers, refugees, warlords and the International Criminal Court. ""Law & Order: SVU"" traditionally involves difficult subject matter such as kidnapping, rape and homicide. Emmy-nominated actor Meloni, who plays Detective Elliot Stabler on the show, explained that the intent behind the issues raised on the program has always been to ""shine light in the dark places that no one wants to go or talk about because there's usually a lot of shame and denial about it."" Meloni described how the U.N. episode ""really does kind of revolve around child soldiers, how they've been brainwashed, the horrible journeys that they've had to endure and how they can be assimilated back and be productive. And I think in this particular episode, we're trying to carry on with whatever clout we may possess. We have the medium to shine the light out there and tell this story."" Considering the ""ripped-from-the-headlines"" and complicated themes regarding conflict in Africa and the ICC, ""Special Victims Unit"" writers and actors relied on Enough Project co-founder John Prendergast as a consultant throughout the filming. The Enough Project is an advocacy group committed to preventing genocide, crimes against humanity and other atrocities in six historically tumultuous African nations. Prendergast explained that he perceived the episode as ""one where reality dovetailed quite neatly with fiction, and hopefully more people will understand now what is happening in real life with President Bashir and Sudan, and then the accountability for war crimes because they saw it on 'Law & Order.' "" On March 4, the International Criminal Court indicted Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, with war crimes and crimes against humanity. This was the first time such charges have been leveled against a sitting head of state. The ""Special Victims Unit"" filming was the first official project within Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's newly formed Creative Community Outreach Initiative. The intent of the program is to establish a relationship with international film and television industries to enhance the image of the United Nations and to ""raise the profile of critical global issues,"" according to a U.N. representative. Eric Falt, director of the U.N.'s outreach initiative, elaborated: ""We're starting a program where we're going to say to filmmakers, people who produce television series, that we are essentially open for business. You want to come to the U.N.? Talk to us. We'll make it happen."" In addition to the ""Law & Order"" film shoot, the United Nations has hosted two other high-profile events in March through the initiative. Celebrities and recording artists including Akon, Phylicia Rashad, Peter Buffet and Whoopi Goldberg commemorated victims of the of the trans-Atlantic slave trade March 25 with a concert in the U.N. General Assembly Hall. The show was directed by celebrated musician Nile Rodgers and was the first such event held at the United Nations. Goldberg also moderated a discussion March 17 at U.N. headquarters stemming from the complex topics presented in the popular television show ""Battlestar Galactica."" The panel featured series stars Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell, along with the series creators and assorted U.N. personnel speaking about a variety of subjects prevalent both in the show and in today's world. Topics included abortion, suicide bombings and post-conflict resolution. Goldberg summed up the purpose of the occasion, saying, ""much like the fictional ships and planets in the 'BSG' universe, the U.N. is an imperfect place, but the fight for justice, equality and understanding remains fundamental to both."" Despite the imperfections of the United Nations, ""SVU's"" March could not have been more thrilled with her experience filming at the U.N. When asked what she would like to be doing if she weren't putting away fictional bad guys as assistant DA Cabot, March said, ""I would love to work for the United Nations. I have a great job, but really all I want to do is actually work in the U.N. I'm pretty excited to be here. It's been a lifelong dream to be a part of it in some way."" The ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" episode is slated to air at 10 p.m. ET on Tuesday on NBC.","TV show is the first to film at U.N.'s New York headquarters .

"(CNN) -- Addie Polk, who became the national face of the foreclosure crisis last fall when she shot herself during an eviction, was a quiet woman who never asked for help. Polk, 91, who was a deaconess at her church, was remembered by friends and churchgoers for her stateliness. Fannie Mae foreclosed on the Akron, Ohio, home of Addie Polk, 91, after acquiring the mortgage in 2007. ""She had runner's legs,"" said Joyce Smith, a longtime family friend of Polk's and fellow member of Antioch Baptist Church. ""They were well-shaped, well-shaped calves, and she still wore her heels and didn't stumble,"" Smith said. ""I used to ask her, 'Did you used to run?' She'd say 'I would run from trouble, that's about it,'"" Smith said. ""We always laughed at that."" But Polk didn't run from the troubling eviction notices that were placed time and time again on her door in Akron, Ohio. She kept her business to herself. ""She wasn't a really vocal person,"" Smith said. ""She'd communicate, but you never knew what was going on. If it was anything negative you didn't know; if it was positive you didn't know. She was just quiet about her personal life."" Polk, made news last fall when she shot herself during an eviction, died Monday at the Arbors at Fairlawn nursing home near Akron. She was 91. The Summit County Medical Examiner's office, when contacted Tuesday by CNN, said the cause of death has not been released but it was not related to the shooting. After Polk's ordeal last October sparked national outrage, Fannie Mae moved to halt the foreclosure process and ""give her the house,"" company spokesman Brian Faith said at the time. ""We're going to forgive whatever outstanding balance she had on the loan,"" Faith said. ""Given the circumstances, we think it's appropriate."" In 2004, Polk took out a 30-year, 6.375 percent mortgage for $45,620 with a Countrywide Home Loan office in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. The same day, she also took out an $11,380 line of credit. Over the next couple of years, Polk missed payments on the 101-year-old home that she and her late husband purchased in 1970. In 2007, the mortgage was in the hands of Fannie Mae, which soon filed for foreclosure. Akron Sheriff's Deputy Donald Fatheree, in a telephone interview with CNN on Tuesday, said he'd personally been to Polk's door about six times to deliver eviction notices. ""Never did reach her, but always left notes,"" Fatheree said. As part of the eviction process, authorities left writs of possession -- legal terms that informed the occupier of eviction -- on the front door of homes. Fatheree said each time he'd return the notes would be gone, and he'd leave another. Polk's two self-inflicted gunshots to the chest were heard around the United States as the lifelong homemaker became a symbol for struggling U.S. homeowners burdened down by debt and unrelenting mortgage companies. News of Polk's plight was so pervasive that U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, evoked her name on the House floor during debate over the Wall Street bailout just days after the shooting. ""This bill does nothing for the Addie Polks of the world,"" Kucinich said. ""This bill fails to address the fact that millions of homeowners are facing foreclosure, are facing the loss of their home. This bill will take care of Wall Street, and the market may go up for a few days, but democracy is going downhill."" Sommerville Funeral Services in Akron will handle arrangements for Polk.","Addie Polk, 91, became symbol of American foreclosure crisis .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Hundreds of French workers, angry about proposed layoffs at a Caterpillar factory, were holding executives of the company hostage Tuesday, a spokesman for the workers said. Caterpillar's French staff say they are angry about a lack of negotiations over layoffs. It is at least the third time this month that French workers threatened with cutbacks have blockaded managers in their offices to demand negotiations. Executives were released unharmed in both previous situations. The latest incident started Tuesday morning at the office of the construction equipment company in the southeastern city of Grenoble. The workers were angry that Caterpillar had proposed cutting more than 700 jobs and would not negotiate, said Nicolas Benoit, a spokesman for the workers' union. They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN. One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building. The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN. Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago, Patrick said. The four others still being held are Nicolas Polutnik, the head of operations; two other executives; and Petit's personal assistant, he said. About 500 employees were also outside the building protesting. A top Caterpillar executive called the hostage-taking unhelpful. ""The actions that are taking place today, led by a small minority of individuals, are not helping as we work for a positive resolution of this situation,"" said Chris Schena, Caterpillar vice president with responsibility for manufacturing operations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, in a statement. ""The best way to resolve this matter is to continue the negotiations through the Works Council to find a solution that's fair to our employees and allows Caterpillar to remain a leader in a rapidly changing global marketplace,"" Schena said, adding that the company was ""concerned for the safety of our employees."" Benoit said all the workers wanted to do was negotiate with Caterpillar and they were upset that the company did not show up to two earlier scheduled negotiating sessions. The employees being held in their office were being allowed to get food, Benoit added. Police arrived at the scene two hours after the incident began but it had not been settled. Employees at a French 3M factory held a manager hostage for more than 24 hours Wednesday and Thursday of last week over a dispute about terms for laid-off staff. Luc Rousselet, who was unharmed, was allowed to leave the plant in Pithiviers, central France, early on Thursday morning after talks between unions and officials from 3M France. Earlier this month, the boss of Sony France was held overnight before workers freed him after he agreed to reopen talks on compensation when the factory closed. France has been hit by nationwide strikes twice in the past two months.","NEW: Workers release one of five people being held hostage at Caterpillar factory .

Outgoing Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, facing, hugs his successor, Najib Razak last week. Until now, Najib Razak had served as the Southeast Asian country's deputy prime minister. He succeeds Abdullah Badawi who turned in his resignation after five years as leader. Both are part of Malaysia's ruling party, the National Front Coalition, which has ruled the country since it gained independence from Britain in 1957. But last year, a loose coalition of opposition parties won 82 of 222 parliamentary seats in elections. It was only the second time in the country's history that the ruling party failed to gain the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. The election upset led to calls for Abdullah to step down. Various challenges await Najib: . In recent months, the country has seen riots with the country's ethnic Chinese and Indian communities who accuse the government of passing laws that favor the Malay majority. Najib has said he will do more to address their concerns. The country, like other nations around the world, has been severely affected by the global economic downturn. Critics are demanding Malaysia diversify its technology-heavy economy. Last month, Najib unveiled a multi-billion dollar stimulus plan for new spending, according to published reports. Najib also brings with him a whiff of controversy. Two former bodyguards are facing charges in connection the murder of a Mongolian model. He has denied all links to the killing.","Najib Razak to become new prime minister for Malaysia on Friday .

"(CNN) -- Academy Award-winning composer Maurice Jarre, who scored movies including ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" among others, died Sunday from cancer in Los Angeles. He was 84. Movie composer Maurice Jarre pictured at the Berlin International Film Festival last month. Jarre enjoyed an illustrious career, working with Hollywood directing legends including John Huston, Alfred Hitchcock and, most notably, David Lean. Fellow French composer Alexandre Desplat, who interviewed Jarre for The Screening Room at the Berlin International Film Festival last month, told CNN Monday: ""Maurice was an immense artist, an incredible symphonist, a magician of the melody and a benevolent human being.""  Watch tribute to Maurice Jarre » . Jarre won Oscars in 1963 and 1966 for his collaborations on the Lean movies ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"" respectively. He then mustered a further six Oscar nominations but his third award came once again through a further collaboration with Lean on "" A Passage to India"" in 1984. He then swapped orchestral composition to become a pioneer of electronic scoring, working on the music for, among others, ""Ghost,"" ""Witness,"" ""Dead Poet's Society"" and ""Fatal Attraction."" At the same time his son Jean-Michel Jarre became one of the world's best known electronic musicians with global hits such as ""Oxygene"" and huge outdoor concerts. His final movie composition was for the 2000 film ""I Dreamed of Africa."" Jarre's career included symphonies, ballet and theatre but it was for his 150 film scores that he was presented with an honorary Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival last month - almost half a century after producer Sam Spiegel hired him to work on ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Festival director Dieter Kosslick said in a statement late last year: ""Film composers often are in the shadows of great directors and acting stars. It's different with Maurice Jarre; the music of 'Doctor Zhivago,' like much of his work, is world-famous and remains unforgotten in the history of cinema."" Speaking in Berlin to double-Oscar nominee Desplat -- who himself scored ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""The Queen"" -- Jarre said: ""I never really had a 'bust-up' with a good director. A good director will always find an intellectual understanding. And that's what was great - I had an opportunity with all these people. I don't think I can say that I ever worked with a bad director."" But Jarre also said that directing legends of the rank of Huston and Hitchock had disappeared and no longer existed, adding: ""The only problem is now, there is more and more bad music that goes 'dang dang dang dang dang...' So...it's better to turn off the music, and listen to a concert of Mozart.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Leaders of the world's largest economies agreed on Thursday to a package worth more than $1 trillion to tackle the global economic crisis. Barack Obama: ""The challenge is clear"" for world leaders to tackle the economic crisis. U.S. President Barack Obama called the deal ""a turning point in our pursuit of global economic recovery."" The plan calls for reform of the international banking system and the injection of more than $1 trillion into the world financial system. The Group of 20 is taking ""unprecedented steps"" to attack the global economic downturn, stimulate growth and expand loans to troubled nations, Obama said at the close of the group's meeting in London.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had voiced concerns prior to the summit about the wisdom of pumping further public money into economies already in recession, welcomed Thursday's agreement -- though hinted at unresolved disagreements behind the scenes. There had been concerns that a rift was opening up between the approach being championed by the U.S. and Britain -- more economic stimulus -- and that favored by France and Germany -- more banking regulations. Sarkozy said the agreement represented ""great progress"" on reform of financial institutions and said ""a page had been turned."" Merkel described the deal as ""a very, very good, almost historic compromise.""

"TUOL SLENG, Cambodia (CNN)  -- The trial of a former prison chief with the Khmer Rouge movement resumed inside a packed Cambodian courtroom Monday, with prosecutors painting a grim picture of inmates who were electrocuted, whipped and beaten to death. Duch ran a prison where people were tortured and killed under the Khmer Rouge. Kaing Guek Eav, a former math teacher and a born-again Christian, displayed no emotion as the U.N.-backed tribunal accused him not just of overseeing the torture and killing of more than 15,000 men, women and children three decades ago -- but of actively taking part in some of them. The trial of the 66-year-old man, better known as Duch, resumed Monday just outside the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. Spectators, many of them survivors of the abuse, watched the proceedings from an auditorium separated from the courtroom by a large glass window. The proceedings began with Duch offering a basic introduction of himself. Court officials then read out the findings of their lengthy investigation. Prosecutors contend Duch ran S-21, a prison that had been converted from a school. Here, men, women and children were shackled to iron beds and tortured -- before they were beaten to death, prosecutors said. Many of the victims were military officials or Communist Party members targeted for not going along with the philosophy of the ultra-Maoist Khmer Rouge movement, prosecutors said. Duch faces charges that include crimes against humanity, war crimes, torture and murder. He has admitted his role in the Khmer Rouge's genocidal reign.  Watch why his trial is significant » . The movement swept to power in 1975. Three years, eight months and 20 days later, at least 1.7 million people -- nearly one-quarter of Cambodia's population -- were dead from execution, disease, starvation and overwork, according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia. The non-profit organization has been at the forefront of recording the atrocities committed during the Khmer Rouge regime. S-21 was one of 189 similar institutions across Cambodia. Duch is the first former Khmer Rouge leader to stand trial. The tribunal, which is made up of Cambodian and international judges, does not have the power to impose the death penalty. If convicted, Duch faces from five years to life in prison. The trial is expected to last three or four months. ""Probably the most important thing about this court is: even after 35 years, you are still not going to get away with it. That is the message,"" said Chief Prosecutor Robert Petit. Even though Duch was not a senior leader with the movement, many Cambodians were relieved that one of the regime's former leaders was facing justice, said Youk Chhang, head of the Documentation Center of Cambodia. ""I think there is a feeling of, well you know, finally -- now it's finally happening after all these years of waiting -- hearing, fighting, negotiating,"" he told CNN last month. ""People have that kind of sense of relief that it's now moving. When I ask people around the center today, people say, 'Oh, it's about time.'"" Four of the regime's former leaders, also accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, await trial before the tribunal. The regime's leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998. ""It all seems so fresh,"" said Norng Champhal, who was a starving little boy when Vietnamese forces invaded the prison. He was separated from his mother after a night in the prison and never saw her again. ""It's hard to control my feelings when I see this,"" he said, as he watched footage of the prison taken 30 years ago. ""I wonder whether my parents were tortured like these people,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir asked Arab leaders meeting in Qatar on Monday to strongly reject an arrest warrant issued against him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes. Omar al-Bashir is the subject of an ICC arrest warrant over allaged war crimes in Darfur. Al-Bashir landed in Qatar on Sunday and met with Qatar's emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani. On Monday, he expressed his gratitude to the Arab League Summit. ""We appreciate your support for Sudan in many areas,"" al-Bashir said. ""This support will, God willing, lead to issuing clear and unequivocal decisions -- rejecting the decision [the ICC arrest warrant]."" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also attended the meeting but avoided any confrontation with al-Bashir. The U.N. leader focused instead on efforts to have humanitarian aid workers allowed back into Sudan. Sudan expelled 13 international aid agencies from the Darfur region after the ICC issued the arrest warrant. The March 4 arrest warrant is the first issued for a sitting head of state by the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal, based at The Hague in the Netherlands. But the ICC has no arrest powers and depends on its 106 member states to take suspects into custody. Qatar, site of the summit, is not a member of the tribunal. Sudan refuses to recognize the legitimacy of the ICC, and has made no efforts to hand over two other officials indicted by the court. Al-Bashir has called the charges an attempt by Western powers to recolonize Sudan. The International Criminal Court accuses al-Bashir of complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity in his government's campaign against rebels in Darfur, in western Sudan. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict. Qatar had been mediating talks between Sudanese officials and representatives of one of the rebel factions, who signed a confidence-building agreement in February. At the State Department, deputy spokesman Gordon Duguid said leaders at the summit should deal with the situation in Darfur. ""We would hope that while [al-Bashir] is in Doha that the Arab League would focus on the immediate and urgent needs of the people on the ground in Sudan and address the humanitarian situation in Darfur and meet the priorities of the comprehensive peace agreement,"" he said. ""The discussions should be on how to stop the violence and support the people. ""The presence of Bashir at this conference should be used as an opportunity to bring forth the international concern to what is happening in Darfur and southern Sudan."" In another development, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi walked out of the summit after a dispute over whether he would be allowed to talk. ""I am an international leader,"" Gadhafi said before leaving. ""The dean of Arab rulers. The king of kings in Africa. The imam to Muslims. My international position does not allow me to be reduced. Thank you.""

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 43 civilians were killed Sunday when they were caught in the crossfire between Pakistani forces and Taliban militants, a Pakistani military official said. The official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said the incident happened in Charbagh, a district of Swat Valley in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province. The mountainous Swat Valley region used to be a popular destination for tourists and skiers, but today it is a Taliban stronghold. The Pakistani government and the army have come under criticism in recent weeks for allowing the security situation in Swat to deteriorate in the past few months. Islamabad has said there are plans for a new strategy to fight the Taliban, but they have yet to offer details. The Taliban are imposing their strict brand of Islamic law in the region -- banning music, forbidding men from shaving, and not allowing teenage girls to attend school.  Watch a report on civilians killed in crossfire » . Government officials say the Taliban have torched and destroyed more than 180 schools in the Swat region. Many families have fled the area, and have been followed by many Pakistani police officers who are too scared to take on Taliban forces, a Pakistani army spokesman told CNN last week. The Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in 1996 -- harboring al Qaeda leaders, including Osama bin Laden -- and ruled it until they were ousted from power in 2001 after the September 11 attacks on the United States. Since then, the Taliban have regrouped and are currently battling U.S. and NATO-led forces. U.S. President Barack Obama has called Afghanistan the ""central front"" in the war on terror and has promised to make fighting extremism there, and in neighboring Pakistan, a foreign policy priority. He is expected to send as many as 30,000 additional U.S. troops to battle Taliban forces. Richard Holbrooke, the administration's new envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, is scheduled to make his first trip to the region this week.","Swat Valley region used to be a popular destination for tourists and skiers .

"(CNN) -- Amanda Mezyk had developed a close bond with her employers' children as their live-in nanny, which is why it was so painful when her bosses told her she was being laid off. Amanda Mezyk, 20, lost her live-in nanny job when the recession forced her employers to cut the family budget. ""I started crying and they kept repeating, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry,'"" Mezyk, 20, said about the day last November when her employers -- a Miami, Florida, plastic surgeon and a part-time dermatologist -- delivered the bad news. ""They sat me down in the living room -- where we usually would sit and talk about the kids -- and they told me that business was slow and they had to cut expenses."" As Mezyk began to realize that life as a virtual member of her employers' family was ending, she thought about the little girl and boy -- Delaney, 6, and Landon, 4 -- with whom she had grown so close during the past 2½ years. Later, Landon found Mezyk crying in her bedroom and asked her what was wrong. ""I told him I had to go away for a little while, and that I would come visit,"" she said. ""I was sad because I had to let the kids go,"" she said. ""I love them like they were mine. And I want to be a part of their lives for the long run."" Her job as a live-in nanny at a lavish home in an upper-class, upscale private community came with many perks that suddenly had disappeared. The insured car provided by her employers for personal and professional use was gone. Without a steady income, Mezyk wondered how she would pay her mounting $8,000 credit card debt. There would be no more accompanying the family on all-expenses-paid vacations to the Bahamas, Italy and China. The layoff also put an end to Mezyk's annual paid weeklong vacations. To survive, Mezyk has moved in with a great-aunt and uncle until she can decide on her next move. iReport.com: Tell us what are you doing to survive bad economy? Industry leaders said Mezyk is just one of thousands of nannies who've been swallowed up by the shifting landscape in the U.S. child care industry, one that is affecting not just nannies, but baby sitters and day care centers as well. The economic booms during the late 1990s and from 2004 to 2007 made it possible for more middle-class and upper middle-class American families to employ nannies, said Genevieve Thiers, founder of Sittercity.com. ""Now that we're back in recession, families are unfortunately having to cut back on their nannies' hours or unfortunately having to let go of their nannies, and it's not a good situation."" In a poll of parents who use Sittercity.com, 17 percent said the economy is forcing them to end their time as a stay-at-home parent and return to work. Twenty-seven percent of the parents in the survey said the economy was forcing them to work more hours at their current jobs. ""Business is down a good 45 percent,"" said Jennifer Winter, 37, owner of Nannies in Miami, a nanny placement agency. ""The wealthy are still hanging on to their nannies, but the economy is forcing middle-class parents to make cuts."" Annie Davis, who launched Annie's Nannies Household Staffing in Seattle, Washington, in 1984, described the current recession as ""the weirdest time I think I've seen in my lifetime."" She's seen about 10 percent of her active nanny roster laid off since last October. ""There are nannies being laid off in families where both parents work and one parent has lost their job,"" said Candi Wingate of nannies4hire.com and babysitters4hire.com. Baby-sitting 'a godsend' in recession . The recession also is forcing more non-working parents in single-income families to take jobs outside the home. As a result, many formerly full-time nannies are taking what they can get -- which often are part-time child care positions, said Wingate. Katie Heath, 30, a self-employed health consultant and part-time baby sitter listed with Sitters to the Rescue in Indianapolis, Indiana, has been taking advantage of the increased demand to augment her income. ""I'm baby-sitting more than I'm working my regular job,"" Heath said, adding that she's caring for children between 12 to 16 hours a week, while devoting five hours weekly to her business. ""Baby-sitting is a godsend for me."" During a recession, said Thiers -- a self-described 30-year-old ""super-sitter"" -- ""everybody suddenly realizes, 'Wow, caregiving is a really great gig.' "" ""Increased numbers of recent college graduates are posting resumes on the Web site for jobs as nannies or baby sitters, because they're not finding full-time work in other fields,"" Thiers said. Not surprisingly, with a rising supply of available baby sitters, the pay rate is falling. The standard baby-sitting rate nationwide is $10 to $12 per hour, according to most agencies. This can drop by at least a dollar per hour in some markets, due to economic pressures. According to its survey, 26 percent of Sittercity.com's sitters and nannies said their pay has decreased from last summer. For full-time nannies, a typical Miami salary in past years was $700 per week, said Winter. ""Now they're getting more like $400."" In the two months since her layoff, Mezyk has been accepting baby-sitting jobs to survive -- working sporadically about 20 hours a week for various clients. ""It's nowhere near what I'm used to making,"" said Mezyk. ""Baby-sitting is not the same thing as being a nanny. It's not promised, it's not guaranteed. My goal is to have a steady income."" Many parents who have laid off their child care helpers find themselves wracked with guilt because they're getting rid of nannies they love, said Thiers. ""They're trying to move heaven and earth to get them a new position,"" she said, including using online chat rooms and message boards. Nanny sharing: Pros and cons . Agencies are touting the benefits of what's called nanny sharing, when two families share the talents of a single nanny. Nannies4hire.com, which boasts of helping more than 500,000 U.S. and Canadian families since 1987, said the addition of nanny sharing has boosted business by 15 percent. ""One family has the nanny for two days, the other has the nanny for three days,"" said Wingate. Nanny sharing might save a family as much as 30 percent on what an exclusive nanny might charge, she said. Nanny sharing has its drawbacks, including logistical problems, said Winter. ""What happens if the nanny gets sick? Different parents have different demands and both families suffer,"" she said. ""Nannies think it's too stressful and a lot of them won't do it."" Wingate agrees that nanny sharing can be complicated and said for this reason, good communication between the nanny and both families is critical. Faced with few employment options, Mezyk said she would consider a nanny-sharing situation, despite the idea of having more bosses. Her personal crisis has brought Mezyk's young career to a crossroads, as she considers pursuing a degree in pediatric nursing. Meanwhile, she still keeps in touch with her former employers and with little Landon and Delaney. ""I know the kids really enjoy me,"" she said. ""When the nanny leaves, it's really the kids that get hurt the most.""","Painful layoff hits young Florida nanny -- in her heart and wallet .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Impeached former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was arrested in December on charges of conspiracy and fraud, was indicted Thursday on 16 felony counts by a federal grand jury, the U.S. attorney's office said. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich is facing such charges as racketeering, conspiracy and wire fraud. The 19-count indictment charges Blagojevich and some of his closest aides and advisers with a wide-ranging ""scheme to deprive the people of Illinois of honest government,"" according to a statement by the attorney's office. Blagojevich, 52, faces charges including racketeering, conspiracy, wire fraud and making false statements to investigators, according to the release. Three counts in the indictment are against the aides and advisers. In a written statement, Blagojevich maintained his innocence -- as he has done throughout a political soap opera that captivated the nation. ""I'm saddened and hurt but I am not surprised by the indictment,"" he said. ""I am innocent. I now will fight in the courts to clear my name."" Blagojevich was vacationing with his family in Florida on Thursday. In video shot at a Disney resort outside Orlando, Florida, by CNN affiliate WESH-TV, he declined to comment on his legal situation. He was filmed shortly before the indictments were handed down. In the WESH video, the ex-governor was sitting near a pool at the resort. ""I'm enjoying Disney World with my kids and I don't think you're supposed to be here,"" said Blagojevich, after his wife attempted to shield him from the camera. ""I'm happy to talk to you at the appropriate time."" A man who identified himself only as ""someone who knows who he is"" then blocked the camera. U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said he hoped the former governor wouldn't use the announcement as a reason to hit the media circuit again. ""We can only hope the former governor will not view this indictment as a green light for another publicity tour,"" he said. ""Rod Blagojevich deserves his day in court, but the people of Illinois deserve a break."" Blagojevich and his chief of staff, John Harris, were arrested in December on federal corruption charges alleging that, among other things, they conspired to sell President Obama's vacant U.S. Senate seat. Harris and Blagojevich's brother, Robert Blagojevich, were among the others indicted on Thursday. In early January, federal Judge James Holderman gave the attorney's office three additional months to decide whether to indict Blagojevich, who was impeached by the state legislature and resigned from office. That deadline ends Tuesday. On Thursday, current Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn called the charges a reminder for political leaders in the state to help stamp out corruption, and he pledged to ""work night and day to clean up our government."" ""Today, more than ever, I'm committed to making sure our government has fundamental reform from top to bottom,"" said Quinn, also a Democrat and the former lieutenant governor who was appointed governor in January. ""We need to overhaul Illinois government to make sure everything is done right for the people."" The charges are part of what investigators have dubbed ""Operation Board Games,"" an ongoing investigation into political corruption in the state. Among the specific claims in the 75-page indictment are that Blagojevich schemed with others in 2002, even before he took office, to use his position to make money, which they would split after he left office. Blagojevich is accused of denying state business to companies that would not hire his wife, extorting campaign contributions from a children's hospital that was set to get state money and pressuring a racetrack executive to give political contributions before the governor signed a gambling bill. The indictment said that after Obama was elected president, Blagojevich began meeting with others to figure out a way he could make money from his position to appoint a replacement senator. It said Blagojevich asked others, including state employees, to contact people who may be interested in the seat, and that he believed an associate of someone referred to in the indictment as ""Senate Candidate A"" had offered $1.5 million in campaign contributions in exchange for the appointment. He had asked his brother to meet with an associate of ""Senate Candidate A"" and say that some of those contributions needed to come through before he made the appointment, but the meeting was canceled after a newspaper article reported that Blagojevich had been recorded talking about selling the seat. A lengthy FBI affidavit alleges that Blagojevich was intercepted on court-authorized wiretaps trying to profit from the Senate vacancy. The indictment said that Blagojevich communicated ""directly and with the assistance of others"" with people he believed were in contact with Obama, trying to gain political favor by possibly appointing someone the president-elect supported. He ultimately appointed a former state comptroller and attorney general, Roland Burris, who was seated in the Senate despite protests from the chamber's Democratic leaders. Those leaders said a special election should be called because of the controversy over the appointment. ""The U.S. Attorney's indictment serves to confirm the public's long-standing distrust of former Gov. Blagojevich and his administration, and it underscores the culture of corruption that has afflicted our state for far too long,"" state Attorney General Lisa Madigan said in a written statement. ""While this is a terrible day in Illinois history, it is also a moment in which we can recognize an opportunity for real reform."" Thursday's charges supersede the ones filed in December. The Illinois House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in January to impeach Blagojevich, accusing him of abusing his gubernatorial power. Blagojevich faces up to 20 years in prison for each of the 15 most serious charges in the indictment, and five years on a single indictment of making false statements. The government also charges that Blagojevich has bought property with money he got illegally, and is going after homes he owns in Chicago and Washington. ""I would ask the good people of Illinois to wait for the trial and afford me the presumption of innocence that they would give to all their friends and neighbors,"" Blagojevich, who was vacationing with his family, said in the statement. In addition to the Blagojevich brothers and Harris, also charged in the indictments were businessman and fundraiser Christopher Kelly, 50; lobbyist and longtime Blagojevich associate Alonzo Monk, 50; and William F. Cellini Sr., 74, another businessman who raised money for Blagojevich.","NEW: Blagojevich declines comment, says ""I'm enjoying Disney World with my kids""

"(CNN)  -- Two months before dying, a Virginia woman confessed to killing two women nearly 42 years ago, authorities said Friday, telling police she shot the women because they had taunted her for being a lesbian. Constance Smootz Hevener, 19, was shot to death at an ice cream shop where she worked in 1967. Sharron Diane Crawford Smith, 60, confessed in a November 28 interview to shooting the women at a Staunton ice cream store in 1967, authorities said. ""I was just pushed so far,"" Smith said, according to a transcript of a police interview. Smith was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Constance Smootz Hevener, 19, and Hevener's 20-year-old sister-in-law, Carolyn Hevener Perry, according to CNN affiliate WVIR. But health problems forced a postponement of a December court date, WVIR said, and Smith, who had heart and kidney problems, died January 19. Authorities on Friday said they consider Smith the guilty party and are working toward closing the case. In a transcript of the police interview, Smith told police she and the women worked at High's Ice Cream. The night of the shooting, she went to the store to tell the women she could not work the next day and took her .25-caliber pistol with her. ""I was just going to tell them that I couldn't work and one thing led to another."" She acknowledged that teasing ""about my lifestyle"" had gone on for a while. Asked how the victims knew about it, she said, ""How do kids find out about anything? I mean, it was really unusual back then."" She also said her stepfather had sexually abused her, but refused to elaborate on whether that played a role in the shootings or helped push her ""over the edge."" ""I don't know. I'm not trying to psychoanalyze it,"" she said. In other interviews with police, Smith said that she got into a physical altercation with Hevener at the store, which was consistent with evidence at the crime scene, Commonwealth Attorney Raymond Robertson said. Bruises on Hevener's body were inconsistent with injuries that would have resulted from a fall after being shot, he told reporters. ""She expressed shame in herself. I never saw any tears. She expressed her concern for the family members [of the victims], as to bringing closure to this case,"" police investigator Mike King said. Smith told police she acted alone, authorities said. But Staunton Police Chief Jim Williams said questions about the case remain. ""There will likely be questions surrounding this case we will never be able to answer,"" he said. One of those questions was the whereabouts of the murder weapon, but a late development Friday may have solved that mystery. In the November interview, Smith told police she gave the weapon to a detective on the police force in 1967, David Bocock, and that he buried it. ""He just said that it was sort of dangerous to have a gun, you could hurt somebody,"" Smith said, according to the transcript. ""He said, 'I'll fix it for you if you want.' I figured it was the best thing to do."" It was unclear whether Bocock, who died in 2006, knew of Smith's involvement in the murders. The two knew each other, as Bocock taught Smith to shoot, but authorities said they were still investigating the relationship and whether Bocock was trying to cover for Smith. Later Friday, the Staunton News-Leader newspaper reported its circulation manager had turned over to police a .25-caliber automatic handgun. Kathy Myers told the newspaper that Bocock gave the gun to her now-deceased husband, a former Staunton police officer, in 1981, telling him, ""Don't let anybody know I gave this to you."" Myers said she forgot she had the gun until she saw the police news conference Friday, and turned it over to authorities. Myers told the News-Leader that King said the gun matches the description Smith gave police.","Woman said she shot co-workers who taunted her for being a lesbian, police say .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Suspected terrorists and foreign fighters held by the U.S. military at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have the right to challenge their detention in federal court, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday. A prefabricated court complex has been erected at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to try terrorism suspects. The decision marks another legal blow to the Bush administration's war on terrorism policies. The 5-4 vote reflects the divide over how much legal autonomy the U.S. military should have to prosecute about 270 prisoners, some of whom have been held for more than six years without charges. Fourteen of them are alleged to be top al Qaeda figures. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said, ""the laws and Constitution are designed to survive, and remain in force, in extraordinary times. Liberty and security can be reconciled; and in our system reconciled within the framework of the law."" Kennedy, the court's swing vote, was supported by Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, generally considered the liberal contingent. At issue was the rights of detainees to contest their imprisonment and challenge the rules set up to try them.  Watch how the 5-4 ruling is a major blow for the Bush administration » . A congressional law passed in 2006 would limit court jurisdiction to hear so-called habeas corpus challenges to detention. It is a legal question the justices have tackled three times since 2004, including Thursday's ruling. Each time, the justices have ruled against the government's claim that it has the authority to hold people it considers ""enemy combatants."" Preliminary hearings have begun in Guantanamo for some of the accused. A military panel this month arraigned five suspected senior al Qaeda detainees, including the alleged mastermind of the September 11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was transferred to the prison camp in 2006. The Bush administration has urged the high court not to get involved in the broader appeals, saying the federal judiciary has no authority to hear such matters. Four justices agreed. In a sharp dissent, read in part from the bench, Justice Antonin Scalia said the majority ""warps our Constitution."" The ""nation will live to regret what the court has done today,"" Scalia said. He was supported by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. President Bush, who is traveling in Europe, said he disagreed with the Guantanamo ruling but promised to abide by it. ""Congress and the administration worked very carefully on a piece of legislation that set the appropriate procedures in place as to how to deal with the detainees,"" he said. ""We'll study this opinion, and we'll do so with this in mind to determine whether or not additional legislation might be appropriate so that we can safely say, truly say to the American people, 'we are doing everything we can to protect you.' "" The Pentagon declined to comment, and the Justice Department said it was reviewing the decision and was expected to comment later Thursday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, welcomed the ruling, saying the Supreme Court upheld the Constitution. ""I have long been an advocate of closing Guantanamo, so I would hope this is in furtherance of taking that action,"" Pelosi said. The appeals involve noncitizens. Sixteen lawsuits filed on behalf of about 200 prisoners were put on hold pending a ruling last year by a federal appeals court upholding the government's right to detain and prosecute suspected terrorists and war criminals. An attorney for one of the detainees, Salim Ahmed Hamdan -- Osama bin Laden's alleged driver and bodyguard -- said he would file an appeal asking that charges be dropped against the Yemeni native. ""The clearest immediate impact of this ruling is to remove the remaining barriers for closing Guantanamo Bay. It means, in legal terms, Guantanamo Bay is no different than Kansas,"" attorney Charles Swift said. Now the ruling has been issued, a flood of similar appeals can be expected. The lead plaintiffs are Lakhdar Boumediene, a Bosnian, and Fawzi al-Odah of Kuwait. They question the constitutionality of the Military Commissions Act, passed by Congress in October 2006. The law addresses how suspected foreign terrorists and fighters can be tried and sentenced under U.S. military law. Under the system, those facing trial would have a limited right to appeal any conviction, reducing the jurisdiction of federal courts. The suspects also must prove to a three-person panel of military officers they are not a terror risk. But defendants would have access to evidence normally given to a jury, and CIA agents were given more guidance in how far they can go in interrogating prisoners. The law was a direct response to a June 2006 Supreme Court ruling striking down the Bush administration's plan to try detainees before military commissions. In 2004, the justices also affirmed the right of prisoners to challenge their detention in federal court. Congress and the administration have sought to restrict such access. The Justice Department wanted the high court to pass on these appeals, at least until the first wave of tribunals had a chance to work. Administration officials also argued the prisoners have plenty of legal safeguards. The White House has said it is considering whether to close the Guantanamo prison, suggesting some high-level al Qaeda detainees could be transferred to the federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, and to a military brig in North Charleston, South Carolina. Most of the dozens of pending cases have been handled in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, which in February 2007 upheld the Military Commissions Act's provision stripping courts of jurisdiction to hear ""habeas"" challenges to the prisoners' confinement. But a three-judge panel of the same circuit expressed concern about why the U.S. military continues to limit attorney access to the Guantanamo men. The detainees' legal team alleges the government is unfairly restricting access to potentially exculpatory evidence, including documents they may not know exist before pretrial hearings. Legal and terrorism analysts said the issues presented in these latest sets of appeals are unlike those the justices have delved into previously. ""The difference in this case is that they have a congressional enactment cutting back on habeas corpus that they have to wrestle with,"" said Edward Lazarus, a leading appellate attorney and author of a book on the high court, ""Closed Chambers: The Rise, Fall, and Future of the Modern Supreme Court."" ""And that, from a constitutional point of view, is really a different question."" In a separate decision, the court refused to intervene in the case of two American citizens convicted in Iraqi courts but held by the U.S. military. The high court rejected lawyers' arguments that Mohammad Munaf and Shawqi Ahmad Omar should be released, saying that U.S. courts are not allowed to intervene in foreign courts.","NEW: President Bush says he disagrees with ruling but he'll abide by it .

"(CNN) -- Andrew Wyeth, the American painter perhaps best known for his painting of a young woman in a field, ""Christina's World,"" has died, according to an official with the Brandywine River Museum in Pennsylvania. Andrew Wyeth received the National Medal of Arts from President Bush in November 2007. Wyeth, 91, died in his sleep Thursday night at his home near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, according to Lora Englehart, public relations coordinator for the museum. The acclaimed artist painted landscapes and figure subjects and worked mostly in tempera and watercolor. He was widely celebrated inside and outside of the art world. Wyeth received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963, and President Nixon sponsored an exhibition of Wyeth's paintings at the White House. In 2007, President Bush awarded Wyeth the National Medal of Arts in recognition of his lifetime achievement and contribution to American arts and culture. Two years earlier, Wyeth and his wife, Betsy, presented to the White House his painting ""Jupiter,"" which is displayed in the residence's family sitting room. Bush issued a statement Friday saying that he and first lady Laura Bush ""deeply mourn"" the death of Wyatt. ""Mr. Wyeth captured America in his paintings of his native Pennsylvania and Maine,"" Bush said. ""On behalf of the American people, Laura and I offer our sincere condolences to Betsy and the Wyeth family."" Wyeth, who lived in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and Maine, ""has been enormously popular and critically acclaimed since his first one-man show in 1937,"" according to a biography in InfoPlease. His main subjects were the places and people of Chadds Ford and Cushing, Maine. ""Christina's World,"" painted in 1948, shows a disabled Maine neighbor who drags herself through a field toward her house in the distance. The painting, displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, has been regarded as Wyeth's most popular. ""His 'Helga' pictures, a large group of intimate portraits of a neighbor, painted over many years, were first shown publicly in 1986,"" the InfoPlease biography says. Those were painted in Pennsylvania. Wyeth, the youngest child of painter N.C. Wyeth, formally studied art with his father as a teen, ""drawing in charcoal and painting in oils, the media of choice for N.C. Wyeth. It was during the family's annual summer vacations in Port Clyde, Maine, that Andrew was able to experiment with other media to find his own artistic voice,"" according to a biography in the Farnsworth Art Museum in Maine.","NEW: Bush says Wyeth's work ""captured America""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- White House spokeswoman Dana Perino on Friday said she would do the job again -- but only if she could work for her current boss. Dana Perino said goodbye to the White House press corps at her last briefing as White House spokeswoman Friday. ""I wouldn't do it for anybody but President Bush,"" Perino said as she briefed reporters for the last time Friday. ""If given the chance to do it over again, would I? Yes,"" Perino said. ""But would I ever come back and do this? No. ... I think it's good to get off the stage."" Perino also thanked the White House press corps.

"(CNN) -- Pop star Madonna and her adopted son met with the young boy's biological father in Malawi as the singer awaited a court decision on whether she could adopt a girl from the same country, her publicist said Tuesday. Madonna holds her adopted Malawian son, David Banda, in 2007. Liz Rosenberg said in a statement that Madonna and her son David met Monday with David's birth father, Yohanne Banda, for the first time since the young boy was adopted in 2006. ""Madonna is committed to maintaining an ongoing relationship with David's Malawian roots,"" Rosenberg said. The publicist also confirmed, in the first public acknowledgment of what has been reported for weeks, that Madonna has filed an application ""to adopt Mercy James, a 3-year-old girl Madonna met two years ago in an orphanage that she visited."" A spokeswoman for Malawi's attorney general told CNN that the singer appeared Monday in court in that country, one of the poorest nations in the world, for a hearing on whether she would be allowed to adopt the girl. Madonna is to return to court Friday to hear the judge's decision in the matter, spokeswoman Zione Ntaba said. The child's family will have to give their permission for the adoption to proceed, according to Martin Geissler, a reporter for the ITN television network who is in Malawi. Madonna has been involved with Malawi for several years. She made a documentary, ""I Am Because We Are,"" which highlighted poverty, AIDS and other diseases devastating that country's children. She also helps run a nonprofit, Raising Malawi, which implements initiatives to help the needy in the southeastern African nation.","David Banda reunited with dad for first time since his adoption .

"(CNN)  -- Fifteen employees were fired for improperly accessing medical records of Nadya Suleman, the mother of octuplets, a Kaiser Permanente spokesman said Monday. Nadya Suleman has been the subject of much curiosity since she gave birth to octuplets. ""We always provide training on the importance of patient privacy and confidentiality,"" said Jim Anderson, the hospital spokesman. ""We knew from the time she (Nadya Suleman) was admitted to the hospital in December, this case would attract attention. ""Numerous training sessions were held to remind people of the need to keep the information confidential."" Eight other employees of the Bellflower, California hospital were disciplined for accessing Suleman's files, Anderson said. Anderson said there's no indication that any of the information was distributed outside the hospital to the media. Suleman, a resident La Habra, California, and already a single mother with six young children, gave birth to the octuplets through in-vitro fertilization, fueling controversy. News of her collecting public assistance for some of her children also outraged many taxpayers.","Eight other employees disciplined for accessing Nadya Suleman's files .

"(CNN)  -- A mass grave unearthed Tuesday in downtown Montgomery, Alabama, is believed to contain bodies from an epidemic of yellow fever that swept the city in the 1870s, police said. Two buildings from the 1940s were torn down at the site, and maintenance workers grading the land in preparation for the construction of a new building uncovered the remains, said Montgomery police spokesman Maj. Huey Thornton. The site is adjacent to a cemetery, he said, and ""based on the information we have from historical documents kept by the actual cemetery ... it does appear that it may be remains from a yellow fever epidemic in the 1870s."" Officials from the Alabama Archaeological Society and the Alabama Historical Association were at the site and are expected to be able to confirm that, he said. It was not immediately known how many bodies might be buried at the site, Thornton said, but authorities are reassuring the public there is no cause for concern. The remains are clearly too old to suggest any recent activity, he said. According to an article posted online by the Mississippi Project of the American Local History Network, an extensive outbreak of yellow fever occurred in 1878, spreading across eight states but particularly affecting Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi. Some 16,000 people died from the disease that year alone, according to the article.","The mass grave was unearthed Tuesday in downtown Montgomery, Alabama .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Key members of Congress from both parties want NASA's internal watchdog fired, arguing he can't be trusted to oversee the $1 billion in additional money the space agency is getting under the Obama administration's economic stimulus package. Lawmakers say NASA's inspector general cannot be trusted and must go. Government reports dating back to 2006 have accused NASA Inspector General Robert ""Moose"" Cobb of ineffectiveness, of profanely berating employees and being too close to the agency's leadership. Calls for his ouster have intensified in the past month, since NASA is getting additional stimulus money for space exploration, research, and aeronautics. ""Apparently, Mr. Cobb thought he was supposed to be the lap dog, rather than the watchdog, of NASA,"" Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tennessee, told CNN. Gordon, chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology, has asked President Obama to remove Cobb. In a letter co-authored by Rep. Brad Miller, D-North Carolina, who leads the House Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, the lawmakers argue that ""NASA cannot afford another four years with an ineffective inspector general.""  Watch NASA watchdog under fire » . ""It's incredibly ironic for members of Congress who have scolded the inspector general for lousy oversight to dump a billion dollars into the agency,"" said Pete Sepp, vice president of the National Taxpayers Union, a nonprofit, nonpartisan watchdog group that monitors government spending. ""The first thing you do when you're digging a hole is to stop digging. Congress doesn't seem to get that message."" Cobb declined two requests from CNN to respond to the complaints. In December 2008, the Government Accountability Office released a report that criticized how Cobb was running the inspector general's office. The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, ""found that Mr. Cobb is one of the least productive IGs in the federal government,"" Gordon and Miller wrote. ""His monetary accomplishments reflect a return of just 36 cents for every dollar budgeted for his office. This compares with an average of $9.49 returned for every dollar spent on other IGs' offices. The main reason for this failure is that NASA's audit operation is not working."" Gordon told CNN that Cobb's ""own peers said he wasn't doing his job, that he didn't understand the audit process and that he was not carrying out the investigation process. As a matter of fact, he was slowing it down, or even stopping it."" And Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, agreed that Cobb must be replaced. ""Inspectors general are the first line of defense against the waste of taxpayers' money,"" Grassley told CNN. ""And, if he's not doing his job, and you stick another billion dollars into it, then you just know there's another billion dollars that there could be a lot of waste of it."" A 2006 investigation by a presidential integrity council found Cobb ""engaged in abuse of authority"" and had a ""close relationship"" with former NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe that ""compromised"" his independence. The two played golf together and took official trips together on NASA aircraft. Read investigative integrity report (Warning: Report contains explicit language) The committee also found that Cobb ""engaged in an abuse of authority"" through his ""habitual use of profanity,"" and recommended disciplinary action ""up to and including removal,"" Gordon and Miller wrote. Cobb defended himself at a 2007 congressional hearing, arguing that he had upheld his oath of office. ""At NASA, I have taken the responsibilities of office under the Inspector General Act seriously and without compromise to root out and prevent fraud, waste and abuse, and to promote the economy and efficiency of the agency,"" he said. ""I've worked with NASA management in the manner contemplated by the Inspector General Act."" But former staffers told the committee that Cobb created a disturbing work environment. ""One of my early experiences with Mr. Cobb was so disturbing that I considered leaving the OIG almost immediately afterwards,"" said Debra Herzog, former deputy assistant inspector-general for investigations. ""At a scheduled weekly meeting, Mr. Cobb, in front of his deputy and my supervisor, berated me concerning a word in a letter. In an ensuing monologue, loudly peppered with profanities, Mr. Cobb insulted and ridiculed me,"" Herzog recounted. Lance Carrington, the former assistant inspector general for investigations, told the panel that ""in many investigative cases, Mr. Cobb appeared to have a lack of independence when NASA officials were subjects, or if arrest/search warrants were obtained for NASA facilities. Mr. Cobb would question every aspect of the cases and gave the appearance he wanted to derail them before agents were given adequate time to investigate the allegations."" Gordon told CNN it's time for Cobb to go. ""President Obama needs to replace Mr. Cobb as quickly as possible with someone who can do the job,"" he said.","Lawmakers say NASA watchdog can't be trusted to oversee $1B in stimulus funds .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska has been ""cleared"" by the Justice Department's request to dismiss his federal corruption convictions and drop all charges against him, his lawyer said Wednesday. Former Sen. Ted Stevens, 85, of Alaska lost his re-election bid in November. Prosecutors accused Stevens of failing to disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars of ""freebies"" from an oilfield services company on Senate ethics forms. But in December, an unnamed FBI whistle-blower accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from the defense, and the Justice Department asked a judge to dismiss the charges against Stevens on Wednesday. ""His name is cleared,"" Stevens' lawyer, Brendan Sullivan, told reporters. ""He is innocent of the charges, as if they'd never been brought."" Stevens, 85, lost his bid for a seventh full term in November after his conviction on seven counts of lying on Senate ethics forms. Sullivan said the Justice Department was forced to request the dismissal because of ""extraordinary evidence of government corruption.""  Watch more on the dismissal of the case » . ""Not only did the government fail to provide evidence to the defense that the law requires them to provide, but they created false testimony that they gave us and actually presented false testimony in the courtroom,"" he said. And one of Stevens' longtime friends, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, said Wednesday that Stevens was ""screwed by our own Justice Department."" In a statement issued Wednesday morning, Stevens thanked the Justice Department and Attorney General Eric Holder for requesting that the charges be dropped. ""I always knew that there would be a day when the cloud that surrounded me would be removed,"" Stevens said. ""That day has finally come."" U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan has set a Tuesday hearing on the Justice Department's request to dismiss the case. Sullivan, who is not related to Stevens' lawyer, excoriated prosecutors during the trial and held the prosecution in contempt at one point. In December, two months after the guilty verdicts, the FBI whistle-blower accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from the defense and reported that someone with the government had had an inappropriate relationship with Bill Allen, an oil industry executive who was the government's key witness. In the motion it filed Wednesday, the Justice Department acknowledged that Stevens was not given access to notes taken by prosecutors during an April 2008 interview with Allen, the former chairman of an oilfield services company at the center of a corruption probe in Alaska. The notes show that responses by Allen, the prosecution's star witness, were inconsistent with testimony he gave against Stevens, and that information from the interview could have benefited Stevens at trial, the motion says. ""In light of this conclusion, and in consideration of the totality of the circumstances of this particular case, I have determined that it is in the interest of justice to dismiss the indictment and not proceed with a new trial,"" Holder said in a written statement. Hatch, a senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he called Stevens in Alaska on Wednesday and the former senator sounded ""elated, as anyone would."" ""Here's a guy who gave better than 60 years' service to the country and was screwed -- screwed by our own Justice Department,"" Hatch said. But he praised Holder for ""standing up and fixing this foul situation."" ""I think he's more than shown integrity and decency in this matter, and it's not an easy thing for him to do that,"" Hatch said. ""He has, in looking at it, realized now what people like myself have been saying is 100 percent right."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, also commented on the Justice Department's request, saying, ""Ted Stevens is 85 years old. He's already been punished enough. I'm satisfied."" And in a statement Wednesday, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said that Stevens ""deserves to be very happy today. What a horrible thing he has endured. The blatant attempts by adversaries to destroy one's reputation, career and finances are an abuse of our well-guarded process and violate our God-given rights afforded in the Constitution. ""It is a frightening thing to contemplate what we may be witnessing here -- the undermining of the political process through unscrupulous ploys and professional misconduct. Senator Stevens ... never gave up hope. It is unfortunate that, as a result of the questionable proceedings which led to Senator Stevens' conviction days before the election, Alaskans lost an esteemed statesman on Capitol Hill. His presence is missed."" The Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility will review the prosecution team's conduct in Stevens' case, Holder said. Asked whether the prosecutors should be charged themselves, Sullivan told reporters, ""That is not my job. I'm a defense lawyer."" During the trial, Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich said Stevens hid ""hundreds of thousands of dollars of freebies"" he received from Allen's company, VECO, and from Allen himself. Many of the allegedly free services were given as part of the renovation of Stevens' Alaska home, prosecutors said. CNN's Terry Frieden, Paul Courson, Ted Barrett and Deb Krajnak contributed to this report.","NEW: Senate majority leader, Alaska governor back Justice Department action .

"(CNN) -- If you happen to browse upon a news story that's too odd to be true Wednesday, hold your outrage and check the calendar. A Lebanese newspaper ran a caricature last year of two opposition leaders hugging in light of April Fools' Day. It's April Fools' Day -- when media outlets around the world take a break from the serious business of delivering news and play fast and furious with the facts. No one quite knows when the practice began, but any journalist will point to what is undoubtedly the biggest hoax that any reputable news establishment ever pulled: A 1957 BBC report that said, thanks to a mild winter and the elimination of the spaghetti weevil, Swiss farmers were enjoying a bumper spaghetti crop. The segment was accompanied by pictures of farmers pulling strands of spaghetti from trees -- and prompted hundreds of viewers to call in, wanting to know how they could grow their own spaghetti trees. While not as elaborate, the pranks that media outlets harvested this year have been quite rich: . The Guardian in London ran a story Wednesday announcing that, after 188 years as a print publication, it will become the first newspaper to deliver news exclusively via Twitter. Twitter, a micro-blogging site, allows users to post updates that are 140 characters long. In keeping with the limitation, the newspaper said it had undertaken a mammoth project to retool the newspaper's entire archive. For example, Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight from New York to Paris, France, was condensed to: ""OMG first successful transatlantic air flight wow, pretty cool! Boring day otherwise ... sigh."" The news isn't always black and white. The Taipei Times, one of three English-language dailies in Taiwan, fooled many readers with a report that two pandas donated by China to the Taipei Zoo were, in fact, brown forest bears dyed black and white. To render a whiff of authenticity to the story, editors made a reference to China's tainted-milk scandal that sickened 300,000 people last year. But the story contained enough outrageous lines to clue in readers. Among them, a quote from a souvenir stand operator who worried the panda deception would affect sales of her ""stuffed panda toys, panda T-shirts, panda pens and notepads, remote-controlled pandas on wheels, caps with panda ears on top, panda fans, panda flashlights, panda mugs, panda eyeglass cases, panda face masks, panda slippers, panda wallet and panda purses."" Sometimes, of course, the pranks backfire. In Australia, the Herald Sun newspaper drew hundreds of angry comments Wednesday after a story on its Web site said a Chinese construction firm wanted to buy naming rights to the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. Many readers did not realize the story was a hoax -- despite a quote from a spokeswoman named April Fulton. iReport.com: Share your best April Fools' office pranks and jokes . Geoffrey Davies, the head of the journalism department at London's University of Westminster, said such pranks do not particularly affect the credibility of a news organization. ""They are done in a way that you know it's a joke,"" he said. ""In the Guardian story, for example, the clue is in the name of the journalist [Rio Palof] -- which is an anagram for April Fool. People look out for them really, and therefore, you kind of open the paper trying to spot the spoof story."" Of course, news outlets aren't the only ones who hoodwink readers on April 1. The town of Rotorua, a popular tourist stop in New Zealand, said a rotten egg smell that permeates the town is such an aphrodisiac that Playboy founder Hugh Hefner wants to build a mansion there. Microsoft Corp. said it is releasing a new Xbox 360 video game, ""Alpine Legend,"" which will do for fans of yodeling what ""Guitar Hero"" did for rock music. And car manufacturer BMW announced in ads in British newspapers that it had developed ""Magnetic Tow Technology."" ""BMW Magnetic Tow Technology is an ingenious new system that locks on to the car in front via an enhanced magnetic beam,"" the ad said. ""Once your BMW is attached you are free to release your foot from the accelerator and turn off your engine."" Steve Price, features editor of the Taipei Times, said such hoaxes are not only good for a laugh but serve a purpose. ""It highlights an important aspect of media that readers and viewers should keep a critical mind when they read stories or watch TV,"" he said. ""I think that is especially true with the advent of the Internet and the proliferation of blogging."" The origins of pulling pranks on April Fools' Day is unclear. Some believe it dates back to the time when the Gregorian calendar was first adopted, changing the beginning of the year to January 1 from April 1. Those who still held on to the Julian calendar were referred to as ""April Fools."" Traditionally, the pranks are pulled before noon on this day. But a wildly successful prank this year was conceived and executed much earlier. Millions of Web users fell for a video that claimed to be the first flying five-star hotel in a converted Soviet-era helicopter. The 37-second clip, which was posted online Thursday, was an elaborate computer-generated hoax by the airport hotel chain Yotel. If you were one of the many who fell for the prank, hold your disappointment. You can still reserve rooms on the moon through Hotels.com or book flights to Mars through Expedia.com for $99. But hurry. The offers end Wednesday.","If a news item seems especially outrageous on April 1, it just may be a hoax .

"(CNN) -- There is one holiday destination that should shake the faith of even the most vehement climate change skeptic: the Carteret Islands, part of Papua New Guinea, located northeast of Bougainville. The Carteret Islands are just one of a number of places already feeling the effects of climate change. The palm trees sway gently under a balmy sun, the beaches are perfect, and stretched out as far as the eye can see is the wide blue of the Pacific Ocean. The only problem with this idyllic scene is that the water is getting closer; slowly but surely, as global warming bites and sea levels rise, the islands are being swallowed up, leaving the few hundred inhabitants pondering an uncertain future. ""King tides and sea surges are floodling the island to a knee high and it is difficult for the salt water to dry up,"" says Ursula Rakova, a Carteret islander and campaigner. ""Fruit trees and nut trees have lost their leaves and only skeleton branches are left standing. The only greenery is from coconut and sago palms... People have no garden food to feed on... We have lost more than 60 percent of our land already."" The problem is that on the Carteret Islands, a horseshoe shaped scatter of small islands around a central lagoon, nowhere is more than 1.2 meters above sea level. If anywhere was the canary in the mine forewarning us of the disaster predicted in low lying areas of the world if runaway climate change takes hold, it's right here. Rakova says there is a growing dependency culture on the island as people rely on international aid for food, which is destroying the social and cultural fabric of the Carterets. ""This is a state of emergency,"" she says. ""Why are the rich nations ignoring the fate of the Carterets Islanders? Are the rich nations waiting for the islanders to float before they can act and put money where their mouths are in terms of human rights?"" It's a cruel irony that the people with some of the lowest carbon footprints are already paying the price for the emissions of far richer countries, and are forced to leave their homes for an uncertain future. But the Carteret Islanders aren't alone. Environmentalists point to Inuit communities threatened by melting ice in Greenland, and those living around the fast-shrinking Lake Chad in Africa, as among many already feeling the effects.  Watch the effects of warming temperatures on Arctic ice » . ""The issue of environmental refugees promises to rank as one of the foremost human crises or our time,"" says British environmentalist and Oxford University professor Norman Myers, who has published extensively on the subject. A report by Friends of the Earth in 2007 identified communities all over the world, from Brazil and Honduras, to Malaysia, Mali, Peru and even the UK, that were directly under threat from a mix of drought, rising sea levels, other extreme weather and disease. Climate refugees: Causing controversy . As much of the primary research on our future climate looks increasingly gloomy -- and privately some scientists will make far blacker predictions than they publish - the world seems faced with a growing challenge. Experts at the climate change conference in Copenhagen in March issued a stark warning when they revised up the scale of projected sea level rises, saying many coastal areas around the world could be completely inundated by 2100. ""It is now clear that there are going to be massive flooding disasters around the globe,"" said Dr David Vaughan, of the British Antarctic Survey, in Copenhagen. As well as low-lying areas of Bangladesh and the Maldives, the scientists warned that the Netherlands could face catastrophic floods, and large areas of Florida and the UK, including the Thames Estuary, may disappear under the waves. But despite the threat of widespread future problems -- and the reality of life for the Carteret Islanders now - the term ""environmental refugees"" remains controversial. Some NGOs, such as Greenpeace, have spoken in terms of 150 million displaced people being driven from their homes by 2050 as climate change makes their lives impossible. Their figures are backed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Other groups, notably the Norwegian Refugee Council, have urged caution and said such quantities are impossible to verify, even suggesting that they could play into the hands of right wing groups keen to create a fear of a tide of immigration. ""Because one cannot completely isolate climate change as a cause however, it is difficult, if not impossible to stipulate any numbers,"" the NRC writes in the 2008 report, Future Flood of Refugees. But while the controversy rages, some experts warn the needs of people such as the Carteret Islanders are being ignored. As the numbers of similar soon-to-be refugees looks likely to grow exponentially, the world needs to wake up to the problem and decide fast how to deal with it. ""There is no legal recognition of people displaced by environmental causes and no international treaty protecting them,"" says Stephanie Long, Climate Coordinator at Friends of the Earth International. Meanwhile back on the Carteret Islanders time is running out and an entire cultural group needs relocating because of rising seas. By 2015 Friends of the Earth International estimate the islands will be largely uninhabitable. Islanders have tried to fight the sea by planting mangroves and building walls, but storm surges and high tides continue to destroy homes and crops, and contaminate fresh water. Since 2007 the slow process of evacuation has been ongoing. Not for the first time, a quiet, remote group of people seem to be slipping through the fingers of the global community. It is unlikely they will be the last. ""I wish that the people causing the melting of the icecaps would do something to help us stay in our homes,"" says John Sailik from Han Island, Carterets. ""Because we love living on our little island.""","Carteret Islands of Papua New Guinea losing land to rising sea levels .

"(CNN) -- North Korea accused the United States and South Korea of sending spy planes on about 200 missions near the isolated communist nation ahead of a North Korea rocket launch scheduled for early April. Pyongyang claims reconnaissance aircraft, including the high-altitude U-2 spy plane, have flown spy missions. ""The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet military warmongers perpetrated intensive aerial espionage against the DPRK (North Korea) in March by massively mobilizing strategic and tactical reconnaissance planes with various missions,"" a military source said, according to a report from North Korea's state-run news service, KCNA, on Tuesday. Pyongyang said the United States committed 110 cases of ""aerial espionage and the South Korean puppet forces at least 80 cases,"" during March, KCNA reported. The source said the missions utilized six types of reconnaissance aircraft, including the high-altitude U-2 spy plane. ""The U.S. imperialist warmongers had better bear in mind that ... spy planes perpetrating espionage against the DPRK are within the range of its strikes."" The Pentagon was not immediately available to comment on the story. The North Korean government says it will launch a commercial satellite atop a rocket sometime between April 4 and April 8. Satellite imagery taken on Sunday appears to show a rocket at the Musudan-ri launch site in northeastern North Korea. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Sunday there is little doubt that the planned rocket launch is designed to bolster North Korea's military capability. He also indicated that the U.S. military could be prepared to shoot down a North Korean missile if the rogue regime develops the capability to reach Hawaii or the western continental United States in a future launch.  Watch analysis of Pyongyang's planned rocket launch » . Both the United States and Japan have mobilized missile defense systems ahead of the launch. North Korea has threatened to start a war if Japan were to shoot down its rocket. Tokyo said the move is aimed at shooting down any debris from the launch that might fall into Japanese territory. U.S. Navy ships capable of shooting down ballistic missiles have been moved to the Sea of Japan, a Navy spokesman said. The United States generally has a number of ships equipped with powerful Aegis radar in the Sea of Japan because of North Korean threats to launch rockets. The ships are designed to track and, if needed, shoot down ballistic missiles. The United States has no plans to shoot down the North Korean rocket, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said last week, but will raise the issue with the U.N.

"(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI refused Wednesday to soften the Vatican's ban on condom use as he arrived in Africa for his first visit to the continent as pope. Cameroonian President Paul Biya, left, walks with Pope Benedict XVI at the airport in Yaounde, Tuesday. He landed in Cameroon, the first stop on a trip that will also take him to Angola. Sub-Saharan Africa has been hit harder by AIDS and HIV than any other region of the world, according to the United Nations and World Health Organization. There has been fierce debate between those who advocate the use of condoms to help stop the spread of the epidemic and those who oppose it. The pontiff reiterated the Vatican's policy on condom use as he flew from Rome to Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, CNN Vatican analyst John Allen said. Pope Benedict has always made it clear he intends to uphold the traditional Catholic teaching on artificial contraception -- a ""clear moral prohibition"" -- Allen said. But his remarks Tuesday were among the first times he stated the policy explicitly since he became pope nearly four years ago. He has, however, assembled a panel of scientists and theologians to consider the narrow question of whether to allow condoms for married couples, one of whom has HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. It is still not clear how the pope will rule on the matter, said Allen, who is also a senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. The Catholic Church has long been on the front line of HIV care, he said, adding that it is probably the largest private provider of HIV care in the world. More than 22 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with HIV, according to a 2008 UNAIDS/WHO report. Nine out of 10 children with HIV in the world live in the region, which has 11.4 million orphans because of AIDS, the report said, and 1.5 million people there died of the disease in 2007.","Pope Benedict XVI refuses to soften the Vatican's ban on condom use .

"(CNN)  -- A baby ape born in the UK is settling into a new life in a German zoo after flying from Birmingham to Frankfurt -- monkey business class. Bili the bonobo is to be fostered by an ape at Frankfurt Zoo. The three-month old male bonobo -- who is to be fostered by a family of German apes after being rejected by his natural mother -- was considered too young and too fragile to travel cargo class, a spokeswoman for the UK's Twycross Zoo told CNN. Instead, the tiny ape named Bili checked in for the Lufthansa flight with special travel documents -- including a fake passport in the name of ""Bili the Bonobo"" -- before taking a seat in the cabin alongside a handler from Frankfurt Zoo, who had flown over to accompany him on his unusual journey. ""He was with his keeper all the way to make him feel more comfortable and relaxed, rather than being in a crate,"" said spokeswoman Kim Riley. ""I just wish I'd been there to see the other passengers' faces."" Bonobos, which originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo, are considered particularly intelligent primates. They are the human species' closest relation in the animal world, sharing 99.6 percent of our DNA. Bili was rejected by his mother after falling ill shortly after his birth and has required extensive nursing and medical care. Zookeepers in Frankfurt hope he can bond with an adult female bonobo which has been trained to assist with hand rearing babies. The zoo's bonobo community will also play and interact with Bili, helping him to acquire social skills. Bili will spend 30 days in quarantine at the zoo before being introduced to his new family, Riley said.","Baby bonobo ape takes flight from UK to Germany to start new life in Frankfurt .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- North Korea, formally called the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is also known as the Hermit Kingdom for a good reason. Chinese border guards patrol in Jilin province across from the North Korean border on March 21, 2009. For decades, it has been shrouded by a veil of secrecy that has prevented us from better understanding this important nation. As journalists we seek out the realities of life there, beyond the myths and hype, but that is difficult because the DPRK is generally inaccessible to journalists. The gap between reality and illusion remains profound. Journalists, such as the two Americans being detained in North Korea, do travel to the border between China and North Korea to get a sense of what life is like in the isolated nation of 22 million people. The circumstances surrounding the journalists' arrest are still unclear. ""North Korea is such a difficult country to enter for a foreign reporter that the temptation to slip across the frozen river border is considerable,"" said former CNN correspondent Mike Chinoy, author of ""Meltdown: The Inside Story of the North Korean Nuclear Crisis."" ""If that's what they did, however, it was extremely foolhardy and really pushing their luck."" China and North Korea share a 1,415-kilometer (880-mile) border that mainly follows two rivers. The Yalu River defines the border on the northwest, the Tumen River on the northeast. By land, the two countries are linked by seven road crossings and four railway points. Over the years, I have visited three towns on the Chinese side of the border. From a narrow river crossing at the border town of Tumen, Koreans cross on foot and in trucks. Those going back into North Korea carry bags full of food and household wares, even bicycles. Some of those coming into China ferry logs and minerals. From across the Yalu River in China's Dandong City in October of 2006, I had a glimpse of Sinuiju, a North Korean border town of some 350,000 people. Using a long camera lens, I saw school children learn to roller skate, and residents celebrating what looked like a wedding. Still the city's decrepit appearance hinted at stagnation and isolation. It was a stark contrast from the Chinese city, which was ablaze in neon lights and a bustling commerce and trade. North Korea's public face is one of smiling children, clean streets, manicured gardens, spectacular scenery and a stoic people united under the aegis of Kim Jong Il, known among Koreans as the ""Dear Leader."" I saw it up close twice, in 1996 and 2002, when I had the chance to visit the most reclusive nation on earth. We were typically greeted by polite officials and smiling children and invited to watch spectacular performances with a cast of thousands. North Korea, however, remains isolated, diplomatically and economically, led by an erratic leadership that behaves out of fear and insecurity. Diplomatic sources in Beijing suggest that China is getting fed up with North Korea's inability to preserve social stability and with its erratic behavior in the multi-national efforts to deal with North Korea's nuclear program. Publicly, however, China sticks to the official line, often calling the two nations' ties as close as ""lips and teeth"" -- one cannot function without the other. In my two visits to North Korea, I have detected conflicting signs -- one, of social instability and another of a tentative desire to experiment with reforms. In 2002, the government tolerated some quasi-private businesses, raised civil servants' salaries and deregulated prices of some commodities. But much of these tentative efforts to change seem to have been aborted and the country remains isolated and poor. What emerges is a nation, now considered a nuclear threat, desperately seeking respect and economic aid. That picture is now intertwined with the two detained U.S. journalists, Chinoy said. ""It will be interesting to see how the case is handled. North Korea has been in a generally more bellicose mood lately,"" said Chinoy, who is currently a senior fellow at the Pacific Council on International Policy. ""The concern is that this incident could get caught up in the bigger picture of heightened tension between the north and the U.S. and the north and south. If it is not swiftly resolved, it will add to the complexity of the situation facing [U.S. President Barack] Obama, where he is under pressure from Seoul, Tokyo and some in Washington to get tough, while trying to find a way to get diplomacy with the North going again."" In recent years, waves of North Korean refugees have fled into China seeking food, jobs and freedom. In the border cities of Tumen, Yanji and Dandong, these refugees tell of misery and persecution. They live under the protection of relatives, friends and human rights activists. Here, people speak of a Korean ""underground railways"" -- a network that smuggles desperate people across the border and eventually out of China. China is struggling to keep out the hundreds of North Korean immigrants and refugees, but stopping the exodus remains a tall order. A fundamental solution, analysts suggest, lies not in China but in North Korea, where many people are running away from humanitarian disasters and political persecution.","Secretive and closed off for decades, North Korea is known as the Hermit Kingdom .

"(CNN) -- Venice has suffered its worst flooding in 22 years, leaving some parts of the historic Italian city neck-deep in water, reports said Monday. A woman wades through high waters in Venice's Piazza San Marco. Water burst the banks of the coastal city's famed canals, leaving the landmark Piazza San Marco -- St Mark's Square -- under almost a meter of water at one point, news agency ANSA reported. Strong winds pushed waters to a high of 1.56 meters (5 feet 2 inches) at 10:45 a.m. local time, prompting the city government to issue warnings to the public, the agency said. The flood level began to drop soon afterwards, prompted by a change in the direction of the wind. Previous highs include 1.58 meters in 1986 and 1.66 meters in 1979, the news agency said.  Watch more about the flooding » . Photographs showed people wading through inundated piazzas and waves lapping over waterside cafe tables. Venice, built around a network of canals and small islands, has for years been trying to tackle the problem of floods that have regularly blighted the city.

"(CNN) -- Donna Zovko will have to wait to travel to Falluja to see where her son died in one of the Iraq war's most infamous attacks. Clockwise from upper left: Wesley Batalona, Mike Teague, Scott Helvenston, Jerry Zovko . ""My dream was to go for the fifth anniversary, and that didn't come true,"" Zovko said this week while visiting friends in Boston, Massachusetts. ""It's not that I'm afraid for me. But people with me on the trip would be in more danger."" Tuesday marks five years since her son Jerry Zovko and three other civilian employees of the Blackwater private security firm were ambushed in Falluja on March 31, 2004. Gunmen attacked vehicles holding Zovko, Mike Teague, Wesley Batalona and Scott Helvenston and set the vehicles on fire. Shocking images beamed around the world showed Iraqis celebrating in front of charred bodies strung up on a bridge over the Euphrates River. The remains were dragged through the streets.  Donna Zovko honors her son » . ""I didn't realize until way after the incident that he had been decapitated,"" said Helvenston's mother, Katy Helvenston-Wettengel, from her Florida home. ""They cut his heart out. How can anybody be that hateful?"" To identify his body, she said, investigators had to gather DNA samples from her son's children. A half-decade after the notorious attack, memories of the gruesome images have faded somewhat from the public eye, as the United States plans to reduce troop numbers in Iraq and a wrongful death suit brought by the four families heads to court-ordered arbitration. The families accuse Blackwater of failing to prepare the men for their mission that day. A 2007 House oversight committee report concluded that Blackwater ""ignored multiple warnings about the dangers"" and failed to supply armored vehicles, machine guns, sufficient intelligence or even a map. Blackwater responded by saying the experienced military veterans on the team ""had all of the resources they needed"" and were victims of a ""well-planned ambush."" In the days after the attack, Blackwater was largely silent beyond a statement that said, ""We grieve today for the loss of our colleagues and we pray for their families."" But the families said they ran into a stone wall trying to get details of what happened in Falluja. ""For the next three months, they never returned my calls,"" Helvenston's mother said. ""Our families were destroyed. We will never be the same."" For Zovko, the suit is not about money or punishment. ""I want to hear the truth,"" she said. ""I want to know what my Jerry was doing before the mission. Why they didn't they have the maps? I want to know who he spoke to last."" What makes this anniversary different from past years, she said, was an encounter this month in Boston with an Iraqi who claimed that he was at the scene of the attack shortly after the massacre. He offered Zovko new alleged details of the attack, which she says brought her comfort. The Iraqi man, whom she wouldn't identify, told her that the attackers did not appear to be targeting the motorcade containing her son and his three comrades. ""We used to think maybe the attack was done on purpose,"" she said. The news made her feel like ""I was lifted into the air,"" she said. ""For me, it was good. I miss my Jerry more today than yesterday."" The gruesome attack put the little-known North Carolina-based security company into the American lexicon and on the world stage. It also changed the course of the war. The House report called it a ""turning point in public opinion about the war,"" which led to the first major U.S. offensive in Falluja. The fighting lasted three weeks, killing 36 U.S. service members, about 200 insurgents and an estimated 600 Iraqi civilians, according to the report. In the ensuing years, Blackwater and other private security firms in Iraq received hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. government contracts. Tactics used by the private security firms sometimes created ill will among Iraqis and Blackwater in particular was criticized, even by some in the U.S. military, for its allegedly reckless use of deadly force. Erik Prince, Blackwater's founder and former CEO, dismissed such allegations as ""baseless"" after his company was criticized by the Iraqi government for an incident in which its guards killed 17 Iraqi civilians and wounded others while protecting a U.S. State Department convoy in Baghdad on September 16, 2007. ""To the extent there was the loss of innocent life, let me be clear that I consider that tragic,"" Prince said, adding that the Blackwater team ""acted appropriately while operating in a very complex war zone"" that day. Five ex-Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty in January to charges of voluntary manslaughter stemming from their involvement in the shootings. A sixth pleaded guilty to voluntary and attempted manslaughter. That same month, the Iraqi government refused to grant the firm an operating license, and the U.S. State Department announced that it will not renew its contract. In the two months since the exit of the Bush administration, Prince has stepped down as CEO and brought in a new leadership team. The company has changed its name to Xe, but Prince is still chairman. ""I think Blackwater's been punished enough,"" Zovko said, ""but they will be punished more. It's time our government makes some rules and regulations about what civilian contractors can do in their wars."" This week, Xe released a brief statement to CNN about the Falluja killings, saying the ""sacrifices of these brave men have not been forgotten. On the five-year anniversary of their death, the company continues to mourn their loss. Our thoughts remain with their families and loved ones."" Prince's promise . Both mothers seem to be making a conscious effort to control their anger five years on. ""I refuse to hate, but if I were gonna hate anybody, it would be Blackwater and Erik Prince,"" Helvenston-Wettengel said. ""I want Blackwater exposed for who they are, and I want them out of business."" Zovko said she relies on her Catholic faith to control her anger. In 2007, Prince told CNN he would be willing to meet with Zovko, but 16 months later, no such meeting has taken place. ""He hasn't honored his promise, but I believe he will,"" Zovko said. ""Sometimes I think he doesn't have a heart, but he really does."" Zovko said she wants to ask Prince, ""Where are my Jerry's three suitcases with personal things that I have never received?"" Also, she said Prince promised to invite Zovko to Blackwater's headquarters in North Carolina to see memorial stones and trees that were planted honoring the victims. ""That hasn't happened,"" Zovko said. Helvenston-Wettengel also said she'd like to meet with Prince. ""I'd like to look him in the eye, yeah. I'd say, 'How can you live with yourself?' "" CNN sought a response from Prince about his promised meeting with Zovko. Company spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said Prince had tried to meet with Zovko in early 2008 but was unable to ""due to scheduling conflicts."" Both mothers' sons went to Iraq after careers in the U.S. military. Jerry Zovko, a former Army Ranger, had gone as a security contractor to train Iraqi soldiers. When that contract ended in late 2003, he signed on with a different company, Blackwater, according to his mother. For Scott Helvenston, Iraq was just the final chapter of a colorful career for the former Navy SEAL, a life that included a job as a stuntman and consultant for Hollywood films. On the set of 1997's ""G.I. Jane,"" shot in Jacksonville, Florida, Helvenston put Demi Moore through a rigorous training program, his mother said, even managing to grab a small role as an extra. A divorced father of two, Helvenston told his mother he would return from Iraq in two months, she said. ""He was going to go over there and make a bunch of money and come back and give it to his ex-wife,"" she said. Zovko and Helvenston-Wettengel have become close friends in the years since the tragedy, but on this anniversary, the two mothers will not be together to share their support and grief with each other. ""Traveling is getting to be troublesome for us both,"" said Zovko, who plans to remain near her home in Bratenahl, Ohio, to attend morning and evening masses at Cleveland's St. Paul Croatian Church. Helvenston-Wettengel also said she plans to attend church Tuesday in her hometown of Leesburg, Florida. Legal setbacks . As for the families' wrongful death lawsuit against Blackwater, a federal judge in 2007 ordered that the case be taken out of the courts to be decided by a three-member arbitration panel. Senior U.S. District Judge James Fox sent the case to arbitration based on Blackwater's argument that the four victims had signed an agreement not to sue the company. A hearing is set for June 23. In court, Blackwater had argued that it was immune to such a lawsuit because, as an extension of the military, it cannot be held responsible for deaths in a war zone. At this point, Zovko said, both sides are losers. ""I lost my son, and Blackwater lost the dignity of the company they thought they were."" Helvenston said she wants the whole thing to just end, but events keep dragging it out. ""They won't let me let it go."" CNN's Wayne Drash contributed to this report.","It's been five years since killings of four U.S. contractors in Falluja .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has given a girl's parents the go-ahead to sue a Massachusetts school district over alleged sexual harassment by another student. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling allows a couple two avenues to pursue claims against their daughter's school district. The justices, in a unanimous ruling, allowed the plaintiffs two avenues to make their claims -- a 1972 law banning gender bias in education and a separate civil rights law enacted 138 years ago. Lisa and Robert Fitzgerald said their then-kindergartner daughter was forced by an older male student to lift her skirt or pull down her underwear. The parents alleged school officials ignored their concerns and refused to discipline the boy. Federal courts had been split over whether the newer law -- known as Title IX -- displaced any claims made under part of the 1871 civil rights law, called ""Section 1983."" The Fitzgeralds lost their initial Title IX claims and an appeals court blocked them from pursuing the other legal strategy. The ruling from the justices now gives the Fitzgeralds the right to continue their lawsuit against school officials. ""We hold that Section 1983 suits based on the Equal Protection Clause remain available to plaintiffs alleging unconstitutional gender discrimination in schools,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote. The plaintiffs allege the incidents happened on a school bus in Barnstable, Massachusetts, in the 2000-01 academic year. The child had told her parents that whenever she wore a dress, a third-grader would make her do things she did not want to do. After the mother complained to school officials, the boy denied the allegations. The principal, after interviewing other students and the bus driver, concluded she could not corroborate the girl's version of events. The principal suggested the girl be transferred to another bus as a possible solution. The Fitzgeralds said that amounted to punishing their daughter and said the boy was the one who should be transferred. The local police department also looked into the case but concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against the boy. The parents began driving the girl to school and filed a lawsuit, claiming the schools system's response was inadequate. School officials denied wrongdoing and tried to limit the case to Title IX, which applies to public or private schools receiving federal aid. The law is credited, among other things, with helping bring equality in sports participation and funding for college women. ""Our concern was that the school district just didn't take things as seriously as they should,"" said Charles Rothfeld, attorney for the Fitzgeralds. ""They were frustrated by what they perceived as indifference by the school."" Rothfeld said the school's behavior was ""pretty egregious."" Barnstable school officials did not respond to a request for comment. The case is Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Cmte.

"(CNN) --   He performed to a watching audience of millions at the closing ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games, but conducting the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra has been the most nerve-wracking thing the American-Chinese pop star Wang Leehom has undertaken for some time. From the Olympics to holding the baton himself, Leehom has tackled a variety of projects. ""I think I always throw myself in these impossible situations and then see if I can scramble out of them and gain something from these experiences,"" he told CNN during rehearsals for the December performances. ""Standing in front of the orchestra was intimidating at times, but I think we got through it, and I think we made some exciting waves in town. We definitely got the crowd excited about it."" Leehom has certainly made waves with his Mandarin-language pop music, having sold around 15 million records, but as his recent foray in classical music confirms, he's more than just another voice with an interesting haircut. Growing up in the U.S. to a family of doctors, he excelled at school but decided to take a different path to his parents. After shunning the opportunity to study at an Ivy League university, he spent some time at Williams College of liberal arts before getting his big break in pop in Taiwan in 1995. At that time he admits he knew nothing about Chinese music and didn't speak Mandarin. Learning Mandarin was just another challenge Leehom rose to meet and he believes that having Chinese as a second language has been to his advantage, and his interest in the linguistics of the language has led to some of his more innovative work. ""I always think for artists to take their shortcomings and turn them around and make them into what define them as an artist is a real trick,"" he told CNN. ""I think it's a wonderful thing for people to understand how language can be transformed and mutilated for musical reasons and actually bring out something special orally,"" he said. Musically he's often been put in the same box as Mando-pop sensation Jay Chou, and has similarly has been the subject of rumor about ever aspect of his life, from his school grades to his sexuality.  Watch Wang Leehom talk about his rivalry with Jay Chou ». Adding his face to a number of endorsements, the pressures of being in the public eye have made him become increasingly protective of his privacy. ""It's definitely changed me. It's like some defense mechanism I guess, to just be private, to keep things to myself, to protect myself or my loved ones. I am the same person, but just a different way of life,"" he said. However it hasn't stopped him from branching out and taking on an acting career. He made his big screen debut in 2000 in the Hong Kong action flick ""China Strike"", but it was his role in Ang Lee's international success ""Lust, Caution"" that brought him wider international attention. As for taking on new projects in the future, be they film, singing or even holding the baton once again, Leehom will stay true to his policy of challenging himself with different ventures. ""Sometimes it gives me a lot of trouble, sometimes it ends up launching a career which has been very good for me,"" he said.","Wang Leehom is a multi-million-album selling American-Chinese pop star .

"BARCELONA, Spain (CNN) -- Cell phone makers Tuesday pledged to end one of modern life's chief frustrations --- and introduce a universal charger for handsets by 2012. An estimated 1.2 billion cell phones were sold in 2008, at least half of which were replacement handsets. The GSMA (Groupe Speciale Mobile Association), which represents more than 750 of the world's cell phone operators, made the announcement at its annual Mobile World Congress in Barcelona Tuesday. Under the scheme, phone makers have pledged that a majority of new handset models will include the universal charger by January 1 2012. The planned device will use a micro USB plug. Aside from bringing relief to drawers stuffed full of redundant chargers, the GSMA stressed that the new device would reduce raw materials. ""The mobile industry has a pivotal role to play in tackling environmental issues and this programme is an important step that could lead to huge savings in resources, not to mention convenience for consumers,"" said Rob Conway, CEO and member of the board of the GSMA in a statement. Last year an estimated 1.2 billion cell phones were sold, according to University of Southern Queensland data reported by the GSMA, of which handsets accounted for between 50 and 80 per cent. That equates to between 51,000 and 82,000 tonnes of chargers. The GSMA hopes the initiative will slash the greenhouse gases that result from the manufacture and transport of chargers by 13.6 and 21.8 million tonnes each year. ""There is enormous potential in mobile to help people live and work in an eco-friendly way and with the backing of some or the biggest names in the industry, this initiative will lead the way,"" Conway added. The GSMA says that companies which have signed up to the plan include 3 Group, AT&T, KTF, LG, mobilkom austria, Motorola, Nokia, Orange, Qualcomm, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, Telecom Italia, Telefónica, Telenor, Telstra, T-Mobile and Vodafone.","The GSMA represents more than 750 of the world's cell-phone operators .

"(CNN)  -- Those who were in AC Milan's San Siro stadium Saturday night for the Italian club's Serie A clash with Fiorentina say the atmosphere felt like a long ""good bye."" Kaka waves to supporters during Milan's match with Fiorentina on Saturday. As Kaka entered the pitch he took a long look around and then beat his fist on his chest -- a gesture commonly used by footballers to display their loyalty to supporters. Was he saying Milan will always be in his heart? Or was he simply giving everyone a heartfelt ""saludo""? Kaka, Milan's Brazilian superstar and a former world footballer of the year, is reported to be the subject of a $150 million bid from super-rich English club Manchester City that would smash football's transfer word record. Milan's supporters are on Kaka's side, because they believe it is club officials who want to sell him. Silvio Berlusconi, no longer the club's president but the man in charge when it comes to make major decisions, said this week that it was difficult to ask someone who earns 10 million euros a year to turn down an offer of 15 million euros, adding ""It's a difficult offer to refuse."" Berlusconi is counting his own money. Italy's prime minister is also the country's richest man and he remains businessman at heart. He purchased Kaka in 2003 for $7.5 million (roughly 8 million euros at the time). Selling him on would generate a massive profit on his investment -- in cash and paid up front. Privately, most Milan supporters would probably agree with Berlusconi's reasoning. After all, when so much money is at stake, your head as much as your heart must decide, and the ball at this point is with Kaka rather than club officials. Still supporters displayed a mix of anger and sarcasm on Saturday evening. ""Hands off Kaka"" read one banner, while another said: ""I thought the devil could not sell its soul, but I was wrong,"" referring to Milan's devil's head logo. ""Berlusconi, Interista"" read another one, referring to Inter, the city's other top team and AC Milan's archrivals. In a choreographed protest 30 minutes into Saturday's match, hundreds of supporters occupying a section of the central stand waved 50-euro notes towards AC Milan President Adriano Galliani, sitting just above them. Galliani didn't react, but perhaps thought to himself that the money wasn't even enough to pay Kaka's wages for a day. The 26-year-old will reportedly earn around $500,000 a week at Manchester City. Likewise, the 5,000 supporters who signed a petition to keep the Brazilian star in Milan would have to pay $100 a week each to match the offer. A single banner criticized the player. ""I belong to money"" it read, referring to the ""I belong to Jesus"" t-shirt Kaka has displayed occasionally after scoring a goal. The banner stayed up only a few minutes but then mysteriously disappeared. Even on this emotional evening at the San Siro there was no room for criticism of the fans' Brazilian hero. At the end of the game Kaka's teammates hugged him and he waved again towards the supporters. Was he saying goodbye to them -- or to a $150 million move to Manchester?","Milan fans express anger over Kaka's rumored $150M move to Manchester City .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Barack Obama addressed Congress shortly after 9 p.m.  Tuesday, but a casual viewer might have believed it was actually morning in America. President Obama takes a page from Ronald Reagan's playbook in his speech to Congress. ""Morning in America"" was the theme of Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign, and it was front and center in Obama's most critical event since Inauguration Day. The president who has pledged to reverse much of Reagan's economic revolution took a page from the 40th president's playbook in his 52-minute speech, striking a defiantly optimistic tone that belied the nation's sour mood and rebutted critics who have accused him of intentionally talking down the economy for short-term political gain. ""Though we are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight I want every American to know this: We will rebuild, we will recover and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before,"" Obama declared to a thunderous round of applause from a packed House chamber.  See video highlights of the speech, issue by issue » . Delivered against a backdrop of dismal economic news and with polls showing overwhelming majorities of Americans believing the country is on the wrong track, Obama's first speech to Congress amounted to a political tour de force. He proposed what many claim is a complete overhaul of the country's economic foundation while ripping his conservative predecessors for transferring ""wealth to the wealthy"" and gutting regulations ""for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market."" And he did it while employing some of Reagan's favorite rhetorical tools. Obama stuck to a fairly short list of priorities while invoking traditional American values of responsibility, hard work and thrift to pound home a back-to-basics message. iReport.com: 'Obama just replaced Reagan' ""A generosity, a resilience, a decency and a determination that perseveres; a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity ... Those qualities that have made America the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history we still possess in ample measure,"" he said. It is time, he declared, to ""summon that enduring spirit of an America that does not quit."" Ideological differences aside, the nation's 44th president has made no secret of his admiration for his Republican predecessor. ""Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not, and a way that Bill Clinton did not,"" Obama argued at the start of last year's Democratic primaries. Reagan, Obama said, knew that Americans ""want clarity. We want optimism. We want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that [has] been missing."" Tuesday night's speech featured all of those elements. ""The answers to our problems don't lie beyond our reach. They exist ... in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest-working people on Earth,"" Obama said.  What did you think of the speech? Rate it through our CNN report card » . The president's agenda as defined in his address to Congress may have been the most ambitious in a generation or even two, but it was also easily boiled down to a few bullet points: restore financial stability, strengthen education and promote energy independence and health care reform. It was, in many ways, the mirror image of 1981, when a newly inaugurated Reagan used the combination of stagnating economic growth and skyrocketing inflation to promote an equally ambitious, simple agenda: cut taxes, shrink government and build up the defense budget. ""You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,"" White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said shortly after the election in November. In fact, Obama's team believes that their boss has already trumped both the Great Communicator and Obama's immediate Democratic predecessor. Reagan didn't get his economic agenda passed until summer 1981, a senior White House official noted before the speech Tuesday. And when then-President Bill Clinton delivered his first speech to a joint session of Congress in 1993, he had only passed the Family and Medical Leave Act and was struggling politically because of the gays-in-the-military flap. In contrast, Obama has already signed into law a sweeping $787 billion economic plan, an expansion of children's health insurance coverage and pay equity legislation. The senior official boasted that Obama has ""gotten more done in 30 days ... than any modern president."" When he took office in 1981, Reagan said, ""Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem."" Obama's response came Tuesday night: ""I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves, that says government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity."" It is morning in America again. A new day has clearly dawned.","Like Reagan, Obama takes a defiantly optimistic tone in speech to Congress .

"(CNN) -- Just like some U.S. officials looking into the mystery, the man who captured video of an apparent fireball plunging from the sky over Texas on Sunday is perplexed about what it was. Video captured in Austin, Texas, shows a meteor-like object in the sky Sunday morning. ""I don't know what I saw in the sky. It was something burning and falling really fast,"" Eddie Garcia, a videographer for News 8 Austin, told CNN Monday. ""I'm looking in the viewfinder and I see, just, something flying through the sky. And it kind of looks like it could be dust, it could be something, and then I look up and, no, it was something burning in the sky,"" he said. ""And you know, this is something that you see at night clearly during a meteor shower or something like that, but you don't see something like that during the day."" Authorities in Texas said there were reports of sonic booms in the area Sunday as well.  Watch video of meteor-like fireball » . Early speculation was that it might have been debris from two satellites -- one American, one Russian -- that rammed into each other in space a week ago. But the U.S. Strategic Command, which tracks satellite debris, said it was not. ""There is no correlation between those reports and any of that debris from the collision,"" command spokeswoman Maj. Regina Winchester told CNN Monday. So what was it? ""I don't know,"" she responded. ""It's possible it was some kind of natural phenomenon, maybe a meteor."" Meteor fireballs bright enough to be seen in the daytime are rare but not unheard of. Two of the most recent fell in October in the Alice Springs region of Australia and last June just west of Salt Lake City, Utah. The one over Australia was unique because the asteroid that caused it was discovered and tracked before it reached Earth's atmosphere, according to the Sydney Observatory's Web site. It says the asteroid was about 6.5 feet wide. A sonic boom also was heard in connection with that event, the Australian observatory says. On Friday, the National Weather Service reported that its office in Jackson, Kentucky, had received calls about ""possible explosions"" or ""earthquakes"" in that area. ""The Federal Aviation Administration has reported to local law enforcement that these events are being caused by falling satellite debris,"" the service said Friday. ""These pieces of debris have been causing sonic booms, resulting in the vibrations being felt by some residents, as well as flashes of light across the sky. The cloud of debris is likely the result of the recent in-orbit collision of two satellites on Tuesday February 10, when Kosmos 2251 crashed into Iridium 33."" CNN's call Monday to NASA to get its take on the fireball over Texas was not immediately returned. Garcia said he had been told NASA may have called him. The FAA had asked pilots Saturday to keep an eye out for ""falling space debris,"" warning that ""a potential hazard may occur due to re-entry of satellite debris into the Earth's atmosphere."" FAA spokesman Roland Herwig said Sunday there had been no reports of ground strikes or interference with aircraft in flight.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Robert Plant and Alison Krauss. Once upon a time, the iconic lead singer of Led Zeppelin and the golden girl of bluegrass would never have been mentioned in the same sentence. Alison Krauss and Robert Plant's ""Raising Sand"" was an unlikely collaboration that won five Grammys. But since they won five Grammy awards -- including album of the year for their surprising collaboration, ""Raising Sand"" -- their names have been inextricably linked: RobertPlantandAlisonKrauss. If they were 20 years old and ran in Hollywood circles, tabloids might be calling them Robekrauss or Aliplant. Plant, however, is 60 -- in fantastic shape, and with a full head of the golden ringlets that became his trademark during the 1970s. At 37, Krauss is elegant and ethereal. And while both are dead serious when talking about their craft, the rest of the time, they're like two silly junior high kids -- he, the charming prankster with a secret crush, and she, the beautiful prom queen who pretends not to be amused. Clearly, they're both having the time of their lives, and are excited about their current musical journey -- which pushes each out of their respective comfort zones and into new territory. Now, he's a little bit country and she's a little bit rock 'n' roll.  Watch Plant and Krauss rib each other » . I compliment Krauss on her hair as a stylist touches her up. ""It's not mine,"" she whispers. Two feet away, Plant clears his throat loudly and points to his own golden locks. ""Why, your hair looks lovely, too, Robert,"" I say. ""Well, you know who I am,"" he replies. We are in Coldplay's vacated dressing room, two nights before Plant and Krauss swept the evening at the 51st annual Grammy Awards. This is an excerpt from our conversation in the basement of Staples Center in Los Angeles the night of their rehearsal. CNN: First of all, this is the screwiest collaboration I had ever heard of. How did this happen? Robert Plant: It's just sheer luck, really. I never sang with anybody before, you know -- only once ever in my life, on ""Led Zep IV"" with Sandy Denny [the late English folk singer, in 1971]. So this is a whole new thing. I've also been coming to the United States for 40 years -- you wouldn't believe it looking at me -- and I've never worked with Americans! This is all brand new for me. Alison Krauss: Were we both nervous? We both were. We thought, ""What are we going to do in there?"" We went into the studio originally saying, ""We'll give it three days and see what it's like."" Plant: Alison's reputation is 24 karat, and I'm an old rock 'n' roll singer. Even the band was kind of going, ""Oh wow, how is this going to work?"" It was great when we kicked in together, and I could just feel the room -- I don't want to say it, but the room lifted! CNN: Musically, you're polar opposites. How did you blend your different perspectives? Plant: As we got started, it was Alison's world. She knew how she wanted to proceed, and we exchanged a lot of ideas musically. And then we both agreed that because we both produced records ourselves, that we needed an intermediary to guide -- somebody to separate us, or to make the journey more clear. And Alison knew T Bone Burnett from ""O Brother, Where Art Thou,"" and he kindly enlisted for the gig, and he brought a lot of great songs to the show. CNN: You challenged one another to sing in different ways than you're used to. Plant: When she goes up for these wailing notes on stage, that's where I want her to go with this new project -- occasionally visit these places where she lets rip, and just lets it really come out. Krauss (melodramatically): It's just reckless abandon! It's just crazy! Plant: I don't know why I'm being so serious. She just kicks ass and nobody knew it! CNN: Now this is all making sense. With Alison, it's letting go, and with you, Robert, it's kind of containing things. Plant: I'm being bullied, basically. Pushed around. CNN: But you like it. Admit it, you love it. Plant: Oh, I do! I haven't even gotten off to being bullied enough yet. CNN: Did you have this much fun working with Zeppelin? Plant: I can't remember. Honestly, I haven't got a clue. I was a totally different guy then. It was 28 years ago. I didn't look as good as I do now, and I didn't share the couch with another Leo. CNN: Alison, did you listen to Led Zeppelin growing up? Krauss: We all have, yeah. (Plant is shaking his head and mouthing the word ""No."") My brother was and is such a huge fan of the band, and I remember growing up and he would be in his bedroom yelling about the records and how great they were. CNN: Robert, were you familiar with Alison's work? Plant: Yeah, to some degree, but not as intensely as I became. And also, I didn't understand the history of where Alison's from [bluegrass], and has been since she was a child. In fact, both of us can sit there talking about music, and neither of us can recognize the artists we're referring to. It's amazing. I mean, all the rock 'n' roll, and black Mississippi and Chicago stuff that I go raving on about, she's going, ""Hmm."" Krauss: I didn't grow up on that, yeah. CNN: Has he made you listen to his music collection? Plant: We share. Krauss: I bring bluegrass. It's the same people. Same blue-collar people. Just one was south of the Delta, and one was Virginia and Tennessee and North Carolina. So we've got lots in common -- but it's the presentation and the whole musicality of it that's different. CNN: Your collaboration has worked out so well that you're back in the studio in Nashville, working on a second album together. Plant: We'd like to keep it going. CNN: Do you think there's going to be an album No. 3, and an album No. 4? Plant: I'd have to move to Nashville, wouldn't I? CNN: Or she moves to England. Plant (to Krauss): Could you stand the climate? Krauss: I'll get a heating pad. Plant: And a season ticket for Wolverhampton Wanderers football club. That's important. CNN: You gained a lot of fans with this project, but there are those Led Zeppelin diehards who've been holding their breath for a reunion tour -- especially since you reunited for the Ahmet Ertegun tribute concert at Wembley in 2007. Plant: Well, we had a really good night, and we had great rehearsals, and it was very emotional -- and if you like, quite elevating. But it was the right thing to do to do it that way. There's no bandwagon. We've already been around the world, and did what we did when we were young men. CNN: That sounds like a man who's looking forward, and not back. Plant: Only last week, I was being grilled again by Alison to get into shape and get it right. And that's fantastic! I really want that. I don't want to go around, everybody thinking, ""That's what he did."" Because this is what I do, and every day, it should be more interesting. CNN: And in the meantime, you've been recognized by the Grammys. Plant: We've already won by doing this. We've brought our gifts, and we've shared them, and the whole surrounding musically is so beautiful, that that's our reward. The fact that it worked. The fact that it wasn't some embarrassing moment of two people trying something out, and saying goodbye, and then meeting at a party years later and saying, ""Oh, Christ, there's Alison Krauss! Oh, no!""","Robert Plant, Alison Krauss collaborated on ""Raising Sand""

"(CNN) -- Police in Allendale, South Carolina, are investigating whether a funeral home fit a 6-foot, 5-inch man into his coffin by severing his legs. The wife of James Hines reportedly said the funeral home told her that her husband's coffin was long enough. A former Cave Funeral Services employee has alleged since James Hines' death from skin cancer in 2004 that Hines was too tall for his coffin and that the funeral home took extreme measures to make him fit, Allendale County Coroner Hayzen Black told CNN. Officials exhumed Hines' body Tuesday, Black said, and a fair amount of ""undesirable evidence"" was found, although he could not comment further. The coroner's office handed the case over to law enforcement officials for a criminal investigation, he said. Allendale Police Detective Donnie Hutto told CNN affiliate WJBF-TV that he could not comment on the condition of the body. A Cave Funeral Services employee had no comment when asked about the matter. But Ruth Hines, widow of the dead man, told WJBF that the allegations and exhumation of Hines' body are difficult for her. ""I'm just going through quite a bit,"" she said. ""It's like starting all over again, and it's left me with hurt and numbness."" ""According to the measurements on the casket, and the funeral director, we asked him, 'Was this suitable for his length?' and he said, 'Yes that will be perfect,'"" Ruth Hines said. Hines told WJBF that her family has used Cave Funeral Services for a number of years, and she isn't sure what the family will do in the future if the allegations are true.","At 6'5'', former employee says James Hines was too tall for coffin after death in 2004 .

"(CNN) -- A receptionist with a gunshot wound in her stomach played dead under her desk and called 911 on Friday after a shooting massacre in a Binghamton, New York, immigration center. Zhanar Tokhtabayeba, who was taking an English class at the center, says she hid in a closet during the rampage. It is unclear how much time passed from the moment the woman and her colleague were shot until she placed the 911 call, police said. But by the time law enforcement arrived at the American Civic Association, about two minutes after the 10:31 a.m. call to 911, the shootings had ceased and 14 people were dead in the center, including the suspected gunman, law enforcement officials said. Four more people were wounded in the attack, in what the city's mayor has called the ""most tragic day in Binghamton's history."" The incident has sent shockwaves through Binghamton, a city of about 50,000 about 140 miles northwest of New York City, as police work to confirm the gunman's identity. A senior law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation identified the suspect as Jiverly Wong, who is believed to be in his early 40s. Authorities executed a search warrant at Wong's home in Johnson City, near Binghamton, and spoke to the suspect's mother, the source said. Binghamton police Chief Joseph Zikuski said Wong, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was unemployed at the time of the shooting. He told CNN's Susan Candiotti that Wong had recently worked in a vacuum repair shop. Christine Guy said she worked with Wong a few years a go at Endicott Interconnect Technologies, a high-tech electronics company in Endicott, New York, where he was an engineer. He went by the name ""Vaughn,"" which is what co-workers called him, she said.  View photos from the scene in Binghamton » . ""He was quiet -- not a violent person,"" said Guy, who now lives in Wellington, Colorado. ""I can't believe he would do something like this. Police are still investigating motives but said the use of a car to block the back door of the building suggested premeditation. ""It is our understanding he had ties to the civic association,"" Zikuski said.  Watch Zikuski give a timeline of the shooting » . The shooter, who was carrying a satchel of ammunition, was found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot to the head, Zikuski said.

Two semi-automatic handguns -- a .45-caliber and a 9-millimeter -- were found at the center, where immigrants were believed to be taking citizenship and language classes. Most of those who managed to survive the incident hid in a boiler room and storage closets during the rampage. ""I heard shootings, very long time, about five minutes, and I was thinking when it will be stopped, but it was continued. No screaming, yelling, just silence, shooting, silence, shooting, silence,"" said Zhanar Tokhtabayeba, who was taking an English class. ""It's free English class and it's very good, but now I'm scared to go,"" she said. Others in the building also reportedly described lulls between the gunshots. ""They told me they tried to be quiet and run away,"" Than Huynh, 45, a high school teacher who translated for some of the Vietnamese survivors during police interviews, told the New York Times. At 10:31 a.m., authorities received a 911 call from the receptionist, who said she'd been shot in the stomach, Zikuski said.  View a timeline of recent U.S. shootings » . She told police that a man with a handgun also shot and killed another receptionist before proceeding to a nearby classroom, where he gunned down more victims, Zikuski said. While the gunman continued to fire, 26 others in the center hid in a boiler room downstairs, where law enforcement found them. It took another two hours or so for officers to clear the building. Some men who were led out of the building in plastic handcuffs were not considered suspects, the chief said. Wilson Medical Center spokeswoman Christina Boyd said the Binghamton hospital was treating two females and one male for gunshot wounds. Another victim, a male Binghamton University student, was treated and is in stable condition at Our Lady of Lourdes Memorial Hospital in Binghamton, hospital spokeswoman Kathy Cramer said.

"(CNN) -- Eight-year-old Sandra Cantu came home from school, kissed her mother, and left to color and play with a friend who lived a couple of houses down. Sandra Cantu, 8, disappeared on Friday, according to police in Tracy, California. That was at 3 p.m. Friday. By Tuesday -- despite an intense search by hundreds of search-and-rescue personnel and volunteers over three days -- the little girl in the pink Hello Kitty T-shirt and black leggings had yet to be found. The mysterious disappearance of Sandra from the Orchard Estates Mobile Home Park in Tracy, California -- about 60 miles east of San Francisco -- has baffled law enforcement officials. A dozen different agencies are looking for her.  Watch Nancy Grace on the case » . ""The entire weekend was filled with just a massive search effort -- a manhunt involving multiple freeways, agents checking cars, volunteers going door-to-door,"" said Sebastian Kunz, a reporter with KNEW-AM radio in San Francisco, who is covering the case. ""A lot of people are pulling for this little girl."" On Monday night, Tracy police and FBI agents searched six locations, some in the mobile home park and some in Tracy, and all of them connected to two men. Authorities did not call the men suspects, and did not name them publicly. They said both live in the mobile home park but did not say how or if they are related to Sandra. ""We're looking for evidence that will lead to the discovery of Sandra's whereabouts,"" Tracy Police Sgt. Tony Sheneman told reporters Monday night. ""We operate on the assumption she is alive and well."" Sandra came home from school about 3 p.m. Friday. She asked to go play with a friend who lived a few houses down in the same mobile home park. ""I told her it was OK,"" Sandra's mother, Maria Chavez, told CNN's Nancy Grace, dabbing tears. ""And that was the last time I saw her."" Surveillance camera footage recorded the girl playing in the park. But her parents reported her missing about 8 p.m. Friday, when she was supposed to be visiting a second friend. ""We just know that she had gone to the first house, and played for just a very short time. And then she was on her way to another friend's house,"" said Lisa Encarnacion, the spokeswoman for Sandra's family. ""And we don't know, we can't confirm that she was there or she was not."" The mobile home park has less than 100 units. There are about 80 registered sex offenders living in a five-mile radius around it. The family has not looked at the list of offenders to see if they may know any of them, Encarnacion told Nancy Grace. And so the search continues. A reward fund set up for information leading to Sandra's return grew to $7,000 Monday. More than 150 tips poured in, police said. But, at least for now, none has yielded information on the 4-foot-tall, brown-haired, brown-eyed girl.","Tracy, California, police, FBI, volunteers search for girl missing since Friday .

"NEWPORT NEWS, Virginia (CNN) -- Suspended NFL quarterback Michael Vick will go to work for a construction company in Newport News, Virginia, after he leaves federal prison for bankrolling a dogfighting operation, his lawyer said Thursday. Football player Michael Vick listens as his lawyers make the case for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The details emerged in a Chapter 11 confirmation hearing in Virginia Eastern Bankruptcy Court to determine how Vick, 28, will work his way out of bankruptcy. Vick's lawyer, Michael Blumenthal, told the court that the embattled footballer will take the stand first thing Friday and explain how he intends to turn over a new leaf after spending nearly two years in prison on a federal conspiracy charge. Vick's 23-month sentence ends in July, but he is expected to be released from the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, in May and serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement, most likely in Virginia. He is a native of Newport News. The sports agent who landed Vick's landmark 10-year, $140 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons also testified that he expects Vick will be back in the game as soon as September -- if the NFL reinstates him. Vick is in great shape and could once again command millions of dollars if he returns to football, Joel Segal told the court. The decision to reinstate Vick rests with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, with whom Segal said he had consulted. Vick was suspended from the NFL after his conviction but remains under contract with the Falcons, Segal said, though he does not expect the Falcons to retain Vick's rights if he is reinstated. Vick and many of his creditors are depending on a return to football as his main source of income. But Segal admitted that he has no way of knowing whether Vick will be reinstated, because the decision lies with Goodell. In the meantime, Vick is ready to ""get back in the community in a positive light"" and demonstrate remorse for his actions, Segal said. He has agreed to participate in a documentary about him that will net him $600,000, Segal said. He will also work 40 hours a week for W.M. Jordan, a construction company based in Newport News. The employment is not part of the official 61-page agreement tentatively worked out between's Vick's lawyers and numerous creditors. The parties involved in the hearing will continue to present evidence and testimony in an effort to convince the judge that Vick qualifies for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Attorneys and representatives from the creditors, including Bank of America, the Atlanta Falcons and the City of Newport News, to name a few, packed the courtroom Thursday as the hearing got under way. Vick's mother sat in the gallery with his fiancée, who blew him a kiss during one break in the proceedings. Among the terms included in Vick's plan of reorganization: . • Vick will retain the first $750,000 of his income. • A percentage of his income above $750,000 will go to a trust fund.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- If you have a stash of pistachios in your house, pistachio ice cream in your freezer or trail mix in your backpack, don't eat any of it. The FDA says it and the California Department of Public Health are taking ""a proactive approach."" Wait until an inquiry into possible salmonella contamination is further along, advises FDA Associate Commissioner David Acheson. Kraft Foods Inc. notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last Tuesday that it found salmonella in roasted pistachios during routine testing. The nuts were traced to Setton Farms in Terra Bella, California, about 75 miles south of Fresno. Setton announced a recall, Kraft removed its Back To Nature Trail Mix from store shelves, and Kroger -- a grocery chain with stores in 31 states -- recalled Private Selection shelled pistachios from its retail stores. See the FDA's complete recall list . ""Ultimately, the question is what should consumers do, and our advice to consumers is that they avoid eating pistachio products and keep checking the FDA Web site for the latest information,"" Acheson said.  Watch why it's important not to eat the nuts » . An investigation is under way into how the pistachios came to carry the bacteria. Salmonella can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Acheson stressed at a news conference Monday that the potential problems with pistachios were unrelated to this year's recall of peanut products, including peanut butter. The pistachio investigation also involves the California Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. Setton Farms told the FDA that it anticipates recalling about 1 million pounds of products nationally in the next few days, which covers its crop output last year. Several people have told the FDA that they suffered gastrointestinal illnesses after eating pistachios, and the CDC was doing a genetic analysis, looking for any link between the people and salmonella strains, Acheson said. He said there could be some results by the end of the week. He said the FDA is ""ahead of the curve"" in the current investigation. ""I want to emphasize that this recall was not triggered because of an outbreak, in contrast to some of the previous situations, for example, like the peanuts where people were getting sick and it was determined that peanuts, peanut butter was the likely cause,"" Acheson said. ""This is a situation that the recall is being triggered because of ... action taken on the part of the food industry,"" he added. ""What we're doing here is getting out ahead of the curve. It's a proactive approach by the FDA and the California Department of Health."" Jeff Cronin, spokesman for the advocacy organization Center for Science in the Public Interest, had a mixed reaction to Acheson's comments. ""I think it's partly the case,"" Cronin said. ""It's good that the FDA is proactively issuing advice to consumers."" But ""this still begets the question of 'how did this contamination happen in the first place?' Is this an isolated problem, or are we going to be hearing the same kind of horror stories that we heard about ... the company that produced the peanuts?"" He said he wondered when was the last time the FDA visited Setton Farms and whether it had known of problems there. In February, the Texas Department of State Health Services ordered the recall of all products shipped from the Peanut Corporation of America's plant in Plainview, Texas, after discovering dead rodents, rodent excrement and bird feathers in the plant. The company's peanut butter and peanut paste products produced at its plant in Blakely, Georgia, were linked to a nationwide outbreak of salmonella poisoning that affected 600 people, nine of whom died. According to state health officials and many experts, the deadly outbreak of salmonella was fueled by poor oversight by food safety regulators and a slow response by federal agencies. The first problem is that almost nothing can stop companies from shipping contaminated food, William Hubbard, a former FDA associate commissioner, told a U.S. Senate committee in February. He also said there are not enough federal inspections. Other critics said the FDA stepped in too late in the peanut case to prevent a bigger problem. Food safety experts say the underlying cause of the problem is that the century-old system of regulation is broken. In the peanut case, the experts say, the federal government failed to oversee the safety of products coming out of the Blakely plant and was slow to identify it as the source of the salmonella.","FDA: Don't eat pistachios until possible salmonella contamination is investigated .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The venerable CBS soap opera ""Guiding Light"" will go dark in September after 72 years and 16,000 episodes, the network announced Wednesday. Gina Tognoni is one of many performers who have appeared on ""Guiding Light"" over the years. The daytime drama's declining viewership led to the decision, according to a CBS spokeswoman. The show, which the Guinness Book of World Records lists as the longest-running television drama, first aired on NBC radio in 1937 as a 15-minute serial, the spokeswoman said. It moved to television on the CBS network in 1952 as 15-minute drama. It later went to 30 minutes, and on November 7, 1977, it expanded to one hour and introduced the wealthy Spaulding family as foils to the show's middle-class Bauers, who were a mainstay of the show for much of its run. In 1979, the show did a groundbreaking storyline when the character of Roger Thorpe (played by the late Michael Zaslow) raped his wife, Holly (Maureen Garrett). The marital-rape story line reflected a significant real-life case in 1978 -- the state of Oregon v. John J. Rideout. It was the first time in modern U.S. history that a man was charged with raping his wife and then put on trial. It prompted national debate about whether a man had absolute sexual rights with his spouse. Rideout was acquitted. Among the actors who went on to greater fame after roles on the show: Kevin Bacon, James Earl Jones and Taye Diggs. The last episode is set to air on September 18, the spokeswoman said.

"(CNN) -- Diego Maradona's Argentina side have suffered their worst-ever World Cup defeat -- and heaviest loss in over 60 years -- going down 6-1 to Bolivia at La Paz's high-altitude Hernando Siles' stadium. Bolivia players celebrate another goal as they humiliated Argentina 6-1 in La Paz. Marcelo Martins opened the scoring for the hosts in the 12th minute but Argentina levelled 13 minutes later when a long-range shot from Luiz Gonzalez bounced in after deceiving goalkeeper Carlos Arias. Joaquin Botero, who helped himself to a hat-trick, netted his first in the 34th minute from the penalty spot and Alex Da Rosa added a third just before the interval. Botero headed home the fourth five minutes into the second-half, before Argentina's night got even worse when they had substitute Angel Di Maria sent off. Botero celebrated his treble soon after Di Maria's dismissal and Didi Torrico completed  the rout from long range with three minutes remaining. The last time Argentina have lost by a five-goal margin was 5-0 to Colombia in 1993 and the home media made their feelings about the result perfectly clear. ""A historic humiliation,"" said sports newspaper Ole on its Web site, adding: ""This is our worst defeat in the qualifiers. What now.?"" The result leaves Argentina in the fourth and final South American World Cup qualification place, five points behind leaders Paraguay, who scored an injury-time equalizer to draw 1-1 in Ecuador. Meanwhile, Brazil are up to second in the table, two points behind Paraguay, after a comfortable 3-0 home victory over Peru at Porto Alegre. Luis Fabiano scored twice with Felipe Melo adding the other goal. Chile are third in the table after a 0-0 home draw with Uruguay, who lie in the play-off fifth position.","Argentina crushed 6-1 by Bolivia in their heaviest defeat for more than 60 years .

"(CNN) -- World champion Lewis Hamilton has been disqualified from last weekend's Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne after presenting ""misleading"" evidence to stewards. Hamilton has been disqualified from the Australian GP after presenting ""misleading"" evidence to stewards. The McLaren driver and Toyota's Jarno Trulli were called to an FIA hearing in Malaysia -- the site of this weekend's grand prix -- on Thursday to discuss an incident during Sunday's race. Trulli finished third at Melbourne's Albert Park, only to later be handed a 25-second penalty by race stewards which relegated him to 12th position and saw Hamilton lifted into third. However, following Thursday's hearing, Trulli has been reinstated in third position. McLaren had complained that veteran Italian Trulli had illegally passed Hamilton under yellow flags following an accident late on involving Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel and Robert Kubica in his BMW Sauber -- who were running second and third at the time. Trulli had decided not to appeal the original decision but the FIA, the sport's governing body, said it had received new information and pressed ahead with a second hearing. ""The stewards, having considered the new elements presented to them from the 2009 Australian Grand Prix, consider that Lewis Hamilton, and the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team, acted in a manner prejudicial to the conduct of the event by providing evidence deliberately misleading to the stewards at the hearing on Sunday 29th March 2009,"" the FIA said in a statement. It said Hamilton and McLaren had violated its rules and retrospectively disqualified him from the race. Meanwhile, Trulli believes justice has been served after Thursday's decision. ""I am happy because I wanted some justice and I got it,"" he told PA Sport. ""I am happy for myself and the team and I have to thank the FIA because it does not happen very often they reconsider something. ""It must have been really hard for them, but they had common sense to really try and understand what was going on. I have always been honest and it has paid off.""","World champion Lewis Hamilton has been disqualified from the Australian GP .

Sarah Brown, left, wears a dress from an American designer. Michelle Obama wears J.Crew. Both women later changed and wore other designer outfits for the formal pre-G-20 summit dinner at 10 Downing Street, the British prime minister's official residence. Wednesday morning, Sarah Brown wore a one-of-a-kind navy dress with red lining by the American-born Lintner, a spokeswoman for 10 Downing Street said. The designer specially made the dress in navy for Brown, but retails the garment in black for $720, Lintner said. Michelle Obama's outfit included a $158 green skirt and $298 bead and rhinestone cardigan from J.Crew, the store's Web site showed. Brown also wore a pair of Astley Clarke earrings, according to a spokeswoman from 10 Downing Street. The Astley Clarke Web site sells earrings from less than $100 to more than $10,000. The first ladies' choices of outfits during this summit are being closely watched by the world's media, both in terms of style and comparative cost. Both women pay for all of their clothes themselves and receive no clothing allowance, according to spokeswomen for both sides.

"(CNN) -- Singer Natalie Cole told CNN's Larry King she is searching for a kidney after an illness caused both of her kidneys to fail. Singer Natalie Cole continues to tour, despite being on dialysis three times a week. Before she finished telling King Tuesday night about her battles with drugs, illnesses and her search for a kidney, dozens of e-mails flooded the CNN studio. They were all offers from people saying they would get tested to see whether their kidney could be donated. King handed a thick stack of paper to Cole. ""These are all e-mails from dozens -- dozens of people offering to be tested to see if they can match, who want to give you a kidney,"" King said. Cole stared at the papers for a moment. ""There are some great human beings out there. That's all I can say,"" Cole said.  Watch Natalie Cole's interview  with Larry King » . ""I'm on a very long list, which is why we are looking to donors,"" said Cole, the daughter of legendary crooner Nat King Cole. Cole said her kidney troubles date back to February 2008 when she was diagnosed with hepatitis C. Cole said she attributes the hepatitis C from her well-publicized struggles to stop using cocaine and heroin. Cole said she has been sober for some time now after two stints in a rehabilitation clinic. Cole said she underwent chemotherapy in an aggressive way to fight the virus. Within four months of getting chemotherapy, both of Cole's kidneys failed. ""I couldn't breathe. I -- I went into -- literally, my kidneys stopped functioning. They stopped, you know, processing the fluid that was starting to build up in my body."" Since then, Cole has been on dialysis three days a week and has been searching for a kidney, she told King in one of the first public interviews about the issue. Cole won six Grammy awards for her 1991 critically acclaimed album ""Unforgettable ... With Love ,"" a jazzy tribute to her father. She won a Grammy this year for her new album ""Still Unforgettable"" and another Grammy for her work on another album.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- If money is power, China is now in a powerful position to play a critical role at the Group of 20 summit in London. U.S. President Barack Obama meets with Chinese President Hu Jintao in London on April 1. So powerful, in fact, that some analysts speak of a ""G-2"", referring to the first meeting between the new U.S. president and his Chinese counterpart on the sidelines of the G-20. What matters most in the G-20, some say, is Barack Obama and Hu Jintao's meeting on the eve of the summit. ""This is a summit of symbolism, where the meeting itself is the message,"" said China analyst Victor Gao. To be sure, the closest U.S. allies are Great Britain in Europe and Japan in Asia. But with its growing economic and military clout, China is now a major player at the G-20. China ""appears to be actively setting the agenda,"" said Glenn Maguire, economist at the investment bank Societe Generale. China is awash with cash, its economy is still growing and its banking system is solvent. It is seeking a bigger role as global powers seek to reshape the economic and financial framework. The global economic crisis has shown just how codependent the U.S. has become with China.  Watch how China is throwing its weight around before the summit » . For years, China has exported far more than it has imported, racking up a huge trade surplus and accumulating nearly US$2 trillion in foreign currency reserves. More than half of that money has gone to buying U.S. government debt. It's partly those Chinese dollars that have enabled the United States to keep its interest rates, including home mortgages, so low, helping create the housing bubble that burst late last year. As America's biggest creditor, Beijing is now worried about its over-investment in U.S. Treasury debts. ""We have lent a huge amount of money to the U.S.,"" Premier Wen Jiabao said last month. ""Of course, we are concerned about the safety of our assets."" He called on the Obama administration to ""maintain its good credit, honor its promises and guarantee the safety of China's assets."" Washington has tried to reassure Beijing. ""Not just the Chinese government, but every investor can have absolute confidence in the soundness of investments in the United States,"" President Obama said in response to Wen's worries. Still, Victor Gao said, ""China is concerned that the massive printing of money by the United States will lead to massive inflation, which will decimate the underlying value of China's massive dollar holdings. Each dollar China holds now is hard-earned money mostly from the exports.""  Watch Gao relate China's perspective at the summit » . With some 40 percent of its growth reliant on the exports of its products, China's economy has been hit hard since late 2008, as U.S. and Western markets for Chinese goods shrank. Annual economic growth dropped from nearly 12 percent in 2007 to 9 percent last year. This year's growth rate could slump to 8 percent or lower -- potentially leading to even more factory closures and widespread job layoffs. To cope with this downturn, Beijing in November announced its own $586 billion stimulus package. It aims to encourage spending by Chinese consumers and businesses and create millions of jobs. But analysts say China cannot do it alone. ""It's almost impossible for China to engineer enough of an increase in domestic consumption to make up for the contraction in demand that we're seeing in Europe and the United States,"" said Michael Pettis, who teaches economics at Peking University. Put simply, Hu Jintao needs President Obama to succeed with his economic prescriptions -- and vice versa. Such a congruence of goals is viewed positively in Beijing. ""The degree of close U.S.-China cooperation in the process of coping with the global financial crisis will directly affect how fast the global economy can extricate from the difficult time,"" said a commentary in Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper. Before the G-20 meeting, China's central bank chief, Zhou Xiaochuan, floated the idea of dumping the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency, replacing it with a super-sovereign international reserve currency. Zhou's proposal has received extensive support from other countries, according to political analyst Gao, who's also a key player in the private equity business in China. Gao said: ""It shows that the defects in using the U.S. dollar as the main reserve currency in the world are becoming more and more obvious, and more countries in the world are becoming more and more unhappy with the United States in its irresponsible way of handling its financial and budgetary matters, often at the expense of other countries."" But Peking University professor Zha Daojiong cautions against ""over-interpreting"" what Zhou seems to be saying. Instead of reducing the role of the U.S. dollar, Zhou may be asking for a greater role of the Chinese currency in ""special drawing rights"" (SDRs), an international type of reserve currency established in 1969 by the International Monetary Fund. SDRs operate as supplements to the existing reserves of IMF member nations. ""Rather than alluding to a goodbye to the U.S. dollar, Zhou may as well be making a case -- implicitly -- for including the (Chinese) renminbi into the list of currencies when the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank work on the SDR in the future,"" Zha explained. Meanwhile, China hopes the G-20 meeting will reach a consensus on how to deal with the global crisis. Said Victor Gao: ""It is equally important to identify the root causes, and make fundamental changes to the international financial system, including cross-border financial regulation, increasing transparency, bringing the hedge funds into the regulatory framework, enhancing risk management, and preventing countries from excessive and irresponsible financial and budgetary activities,"" Gao said. Pointing the finger squarely at the United States, he said China hopes the U.S. will learn from its mistakes to avoid a repeat of the crisis. Before leaving Beijing for London, President Hu Jintao remained circumspect. ""We will continue our contribution to international economic development,"" he said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency. He called for efforts to resist trade protectionism while also calling for a revamp of the international financial system.","Some say meeting of U.S., Chinese leaders on summit's eve is of most importance .

"(CNN) -- Arctic reindeer herders in northern Scandinavia are getting a view from space to help them look after their herds as the region copes with climate change. Snow worries: Satellite maps of snow coverage and melt can help reindeer herders. Using satellite-based snow melt maps supplied by the European Space Agency (ESA) backed program Polar View, herders are able to view the depth of snow and judge where the best foraging spots are to take their reindeer. ""Snow is of paramount importance for reindeer herding, because its quality determines whether reindeer are able to access the pastures that lie beneath it for much of the year,"" Anders Oskal, the Director of the International Center for Reindeer Husbandry (ICR) told the ESA. ""Detailed circumpolar snow information is, thus, becoming increasingly important following the recent changes in the Arctic climate."" Oskal is working with Sámi reindeer herders in Finnmark, Norway, to help them maintain and develop sustainable reindeer husbandry. According to Oskal, Finnmark is the area of Norway that is predicted to experience the largest temperature increases, raising concerns about whether ice layers will form over pastures preventing reindeer from foraging. Under the Polar View initiative, Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) have been providing snow melt maps for Norway and Sweden, as well as snow cover maps for Eurasia, for the last 18 months. The ICR partnered with Polar View in a trial of the maps to examine how satellite observations could help by gathering information on snow change in a timely manner for such vast circumpolar regions. ""The experience so far has definitely been positive, and the reindeer herders are extremely interested in the future utilization of Polar View products that can relate important information about local snow conditions,"" said Oskal. ""These products could have important consequences for herders' decisions regarding winter pasture quality and potential migration routes."" In addition to climate change, reindeer herders also have to face a loss of pastures because of infrastructure development, such as roads, hydroelectric power dams and cabin resorts. The same technology would help the ICR to monitor the different forms of land-use change over time.","Sámi herders using satellite-based maps of snow to judge best areas .

"(CNN) -- Former President John F. Kennedy saw a proposed ban on above-ground nuclear tests as a way to thaw U.S.-Soviet relations after the Cuban Missile Crisis, according to recordings released Thursday. President John F. Kennedy expresses a desire to thaw U.S.-Soviet relatations, on newly released recordings. ""If it does represent a possibility of avoiding the kind of collision that we had last fall in Cuba, which was quite close, and Berlin in 1961, we should seize the chance,"" Kennedy said in a July 1963 meeting with top government scientists. He signed a treaty with the Soviets and the British the following month that banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere, underwater or in space. Kennedy's presidential library in Boston, Massachusetts, released the four-minute recording of the meeting, held just four months before his assassination. The scientists taking part included John Foster and Norris Bradbury, the directors of two of the top U.S. nuclear laboratories; Glenn Seaborg, then-head of the Atomic Energy Commission; and a member of the commission, John Palfrey. Kennedy expressed hope that the treaty could produce ""the possibility of a detente"" between Washington and Moscow, ""which may not come to anything but which quite possibly could come to something."" The meeting took place just nine months after the discovery of Soviet missiles in Cuba brought the world's major nuclear powers to the brink of war. Kennedy said the Soviets were having ""domestic, internal economic problems"" and he was worried about the rise of China after a major diplomatic split in 1960. ""I don't think anybody can say with any precision, but there isn't any doubt that the dispute with China is certainly a factor,"" Kennedy said, adding, ""They want to avoid a nuclear struggle or ... they want to lessen the chances of conflict with us."" But he said the rising nuclear ambitions of China, which would conduct its first tests the following year, could force the United States to resume its own tests. ""It may be that the Chinese test in the next year, 18 months, 2 years, and we would then make the judgment to see if we should go back to testing,"" he said.","Kennedy's presidential library released four-minute recording of the meeting .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Wearing a plaid green A-line spring skirt from her new fashion line, paired with a black patent leather belt and black leather gladiator sandal stilettos, ""Sex and the City"" actress Kristin Davis is the perfect combination of sweet and fierce when we meet up after her fashion show at the Belk department store in Atlanta, Georgia. Kristin Davis surrounded by models and Belk store official Arlene Goldstein. It's a look that totally says her character, Charlotte, with a little bit of screen pal Carrie. Davis is so much like her character, adorable and upbeat, I expect Carrie or Samantha to drop in on our conversation and say something to shock her. As any true fan knows ... OK ... as every woman knows, watching ""Sex and the City"" was like being front row at a fashion show with a plot. TV show and movie costume designer Patricia Field dressed the characters in haute couture as they skipped down the streets of New York City in $600 stilettos. But is this reality? Most sane women wouldn't choose to walk even one city block in high heels. And most women certainly can't spend a month's rent on a belt or bag, even if they have a truly fabulous party to wear it to. So, what about us, the fashionistas on a budget? Are we to be ignored, forced to wear boring clothing and practical shoes? Luckily, no; designers are catching on. Target features affordable lines from high-end designers like Alexander McQueen and Isaac Mizrahi. All of the pieces in Sarah Jessica Parker's clothing line Bitten cost less than $20 before the clothing store that carried them went under. Davis is the latest celebrity to jump on the clothing label bandwagon, designing a line for Belk department stores. Will she meet the same fate as Parker? Davis has the following to be successful. Although her character was by far the most conservatively dressed (Carrie strolling through town in just a bra top, anyone?), she had the most wearable wardrobe, and Davis became a fashion icon along with the rest of the ladies. Her favorite piece from her line? ""I can't decide, impossible to choose!"" she says. So I choose for her: definitely the gladiator heels. ""It's important for women to have a strong shoe,"" she says. ""Then you can wear anything on top. With a strong shoe on, you're good to go."" She admits she didn't have a defined style before meeting Field, who bluntly told her that ""Sexy Secretary"" was going to be her look. Davis' philosophy is a good one: Stick with what works. She takes the look that Field defined for her ""Sex and the City"" character. Original it's not, but everything coming down the runway is something the stylish Charlotte York would definitely wear. Davis is in touch with all of us real women out there, saying, ""I don't want to make clothing that only skinny actresses could wear."" Her solution? Dresses, shoes and swimsuits worthy of a ""Sex and the City"" episode that you don't need Park Avenue pockets to afford. It's versatile enough to look good on every body type. ""Everyone has body issues. I really wanted to create pieces that looked good on different kinds of bodies. I had all of my family members trying on the outfits!"" she says with a laugh. Davis won't spill any secrets from the scripts of the ""Sex and the City"" movie sequel, which comes out in May 2010, but she admits it's a ""happy"" movie. She does hint that our famous foursome might have to cut back a little on their clothing expenses as art imitates life. And she's willing to share some fashion tips: How to look like you stepped out of the wardrobe room on the set of the next ""Sex and the City"" movie? Green. ""It's THE color"" she says. And hey, who doesn't need to save some green? It all works out perfectly. I left the meeting with Davis to check out her displays. Then I skipped out into the streets of Atlanta, in a pair of her new gladiator stiletto sandals. That I got on sale, of course.","""Sex and the City"" actress Kristin Davis says women need strong shoes .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 (PES) has a tough task on its hands. Not only does FIFA look good, it plays well too -- and gameplay was always the area where PES had the edge. Barcelona forward Lionel Messi is the cover star of Pro Evolution Soccer 2009. If you've played a PES game before you'll know what to expect, which is both a plus and a minus, depending on your point of view. The ball pings around nicely, the weight of pass remains just about right and long passes are much improved. It mostly feels like a game of computer football should. The game plays fast and given shots from distance almost never fly in, scoring is still a challenge and goals still get you punching the air. For a series that's always short on official team and league licenses -- leading to silly-sounding approximations of players' names (Ryan Gills anyone?) and daft team titles -- PES gains the UEFA Champions League, which is a small coup. Read our FIFA 09 review here. Game modes are much the same as before, including the venerable Master League, but the new addition of Be A Legend, where you try to take one player to the top, does not feel finished. The graphics are serviceable, with some player likenesses uncanny and others way off. The sound is no better than average and the commentary remains hit and miss. And it's not unfair to say the game menus and their annoying and repetitive music are badly in need of a revamp. Online play is not great and given the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are built for broadband multiplayer, PES is lagging -- literally. You might say the game needs revolution rather than evolution and for next season's release publishers Konami must up their game. Nevertheless, PES' reputation is built on a fun offline two-player experience and nothing has changed there. Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 might not be cutting-edge in its presentation and options, but you still can't beat a 10-minute match with a mate beside on you on the sofa.","CNN Football Fanzone reviews Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 .

"PAU, France (CNN) -- Take a pen, start with the nib at the bottom left corner of the page. Gently drag the pen diagonally from bottom left to top right and you have a quick and easy graphic representation of the price differential between the standard BMW 3-series and its habañero cousin the M3 coupe over the last four generations (and 20 years). Quad exhaust pipes and M-badging distinguish the M3 from standard 3-series coupes . The car in my hands is, supposedly, a 3-series. You know the 3-series. You may well own one. You almost certainly know someone who owns one. It is the ubiquity of the 3-series that has seen BMW become a more mainstream player (without making an obvious lurch down-market) while the mainstream has made an obvious lurch up-market to plug the gap. Ford's new Mondeo couldn't be clearer in its 3-series aspiration. But this latest M3 has substantially less in common with the vanilla 3-series than I have with a gorilla (98.4 per cent shared DNA). Eighty per cent of the M3's body panels are brand new, from the aluminum hood to the composite fenders and carbon-fiber reinforced plastic roof. And let's get back to that graph. This UK-specification car costs £50,000 (€74,000). With the options as tested (including the gorgeous 19"" alloy wheels, one of which I pranged on a curb while rectifying a going-the-wrong-way-down-a-one-way-street maneuver -- I'm blaming the co-driver for this navigational error, and so should you) we're talking close to £55,000 (€81,000). It looks good. It looks purposeful and aggressive and more -- what's the word -- obvious than its M3 predecessors, with the engorged dome on the hood to accommodate the 4-liter V8 and the Aston-like side air-intakes with integrated side-light repeaters and M3 badging. But it still looks like a pumped-up family car rather than a purpose-built sports car (though it sits between Porsche's Cayman S and 911 Carrera in price). It may just be possible to buy one and pretend to one's spouse that it's a sensible family car -- providing, that is, that the 22.8 mpg (12.4 liters per 100 km) combined fuel economy (and the regularity of trips to the gas station this necessitates) doesn't give the game away. Inside it's typical BMW -- leather seats that adjust to accommodate any driver (including those such as me who are short of body but long of leg) and a chunky leather steering wheel stitched with the cyan, blue and scarlet colors of BMW's M division. On the road the M3 is -- simply -- lovely. Over 20 years BMW's M cars have evolved from homologation specials (road car versions of track racers) to sedate luxury saloons that can transfer themselves into sporting monsters. Some earlier enthusiastic driving from my co-driver made it necessary to drive slowly, in sixth gear, behind the slipstream of a motor home to conserve fuel while on a desperate hunt for a gas station. In some sports cars this would require skill and dedication. Not so in the M3, it drives however you want to drive. It can pootle as competently as it can hustle. And boy can it hustle. When questioned later that day, a BMW spokesman denied any knowledge of the cars having had their limiters disabled. But I can state that I was passenger in a car that supposedly tops out at 155 mph (200 km/h) at a staggering 176 mph (283 km/h). The question of whether this delimited limiter is an ""undocumented feature"" or a manufacturer's attempt to woo motoring journalists with a set-up that isn't representative of the sale car, will only be resolved once the first customers take delivery of their new M3s. There is, of course, more to the M3 than flat-out speed on the straight. It's a car that allows drivers a turn of speed on twisty roads with confidence and sure-footedness. You can take corners faster, without fear of picking gorse from your teeth. Take a corner a little over enthusiastically and there's a comforting orange light on the dash to tell you that the DSC (dynamic stability control) has kicked in. When the DSC is engaged flatters the abilities of average drivers. Disengaged it allows skillful drivers an awful lot of wheel-spinning sideways action, as I discovered while given a few hectic laps of the Pau-Arnos circuit in the hands of a pro. What's wrong with it? In common with the M5 and M6 there's the frustrating short indicator stalk that ALWAYS clicks three times, even if you try and cancel it (and in an effort of trying to switch the right indicator off you inevitably find yourself signaling left and vice versa). There seems to be no substantial difference between fifth and six gears. You engage the clutch, throw the lever and -- well, nothing much. But then you really start struggling to find fault. The cup holders don't have an elegant glide and the driver's one isn't as accessible as it could be. While the electric thingum that extends telescopically to hand you the seat belt looks cheap. Harsh criticism. Cup holder aficionados and those who demand milled-aluminum electric hand-me-my-belt thingums may have to look elsewhere. Incidentally, BMW do have a name for the electric thingums. I prefer my own. Just as I prefer the term ""paddle shifts"" to ""SMG"" -- another minor grumble -- paddles shifts would be a welcome option, and one that BMW assured the assembled press would be added as an option in the future. BMW estimates that M3 buyers will be predominantly male and aged 31-50. They will own a number of high performance cars but use the M3 as their everyday conveyance. In the light of this market research, the most obvious criticism of the new M3 -- its price -- is something of an irrelevance. E-mail to a friend .","Fourth generation BMW M3 coupe .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Actress Keira Knightley released a violent commercial Thursday highlighting the problem of domestic violence. In the two-minute film, Knightley is beaten by an abusive boyfriend after she arrives home from a day of filming. Actress Keira Knightley's public service spot was directed by Joe Wright of ""Atonement."" The commercial, made for the charity Women's Aid, was launched online. It will be shown on television and in movie theaters, the group said. The film, called ""CUT,"" was directed by Joe Wright, who directed Knightley in ""Atonement."" At the end, the words ""Isn't it time someone called cut?"" appear on screen. According to the Web site for Women's Aid, two women are killed by a current or former partner in the United Kingdom in an average week. In a statement on the charity's Web site, Knightley said, ""I wanted to take part in this advert for Women's Aid because while domestic violence exists in every section of society, we rarely hear about it."" ""We may not think we know someone who has experienced domestic violence, but this does not mean that it is not happening,"" she said.","Two-minute ad shown in U.K. depicts actress being beaten by boyfriend .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""Why do I find it hard to write the next line?"" If you recognize the lyric then brace yourself for some good news. Spandau Ballet, pictured aboard HMS Belfast, on Wednesday. Twenty years since their acrimonious split, Spandau Ballet -- the pin-up boys who helped shaped the sound of 1980s glam pop -- have announced the first dates of what band members say will be a full world tour. The Tony Hadley-fronted band, who enjoyed worldwide success with hits such as ""True"" and ""Gold,"" will launch their comeback in Dublin, Ireland, on October 13 before playing seven dates across the UK. Wednesday's announcement took place onboard HMS Belfast, a retired Royal Navy moored in the Thames that was the scene of a key early gig by the band in 1980 that launched them on the road to global stardom. ""It is impossible to stress too highly how achingly fashionable Spandau Ballet were in the winter of 1979 and the summer of 1980,"" GQ magazine editor Dylan Jones writes in a biography of the band. Formed at a London school in 1979, Spandau Ballet went on to sell 25 million records worldwide, emerging out of the post-punk ""New Romantic"" music scene. Along with fellow British band Duran Duran, their sound, style and attitude came to define an era dominated by ostentatious glamour, gold lame suits and big hair. ""Not only did their albums sell by the millions, but their look and style impacted on the fashion world and beyond,"" said a press release, summing up the band's influence on the decade. ""They created their own style, combining creativity with entrepreneurship and the 'can do' spirit of early 80s youth at a time of crisis and upheaval eerily reminiscent of 2009. Spandau Ballet are both commercially and culturally enormous."" Following the band's split in 1989, several members including Hadley unsuccessfully sued main songwriter Gary Kemp for a larger share of songwriting royalties. Since then, Hadley has appeared in the London production of the hit musical ""Chicago"" and also won an 80s revivalist reality TV show ""Reborn in the USA."" Several other members of the band have carved out moderately successful acting careers.","Iconic 1980s glam pop band Spandau Ballet to reform for world tour .

"(CNN) -- Insurance giant AIG will have to return to the Treasury Department the $165 million it just paid out in executive bonuses, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Tuesday in a letter to congressional leaders. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said AIG will have to return $165 million in bonuses for executives. ""We will impose on AIG a contractual commitment to pay the treasury from the operations of the company the amount of the retention awards just paid,"" Geithner wrote. ""In addition, we will deduct from the $30 billion in assistance an amount equal to the amount of those payments."" That would be a double payment, essentially a $165 million penalty on AIG for issuing the bonuses. The move comes after New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo confirmed in a letter to Congress that this year, after receiving federal bailout money, AIG paid 73 employees bonuses of more than $1 million each.  Watch congressional reaction to AIG bonuses » . Cuomo also wrote that 11 of the employees no longer work for the company. The largest bonus paid was $6.4 million; seven other people also received more than $4 million each. AIG is under fire for awarding the bonuses while being kept afloat by more than $170 billion from the U.S. government's financial bailout. On Tuesday, two key senators also announced a plan to impose a hefty tax on retention bonuses paid to executives of companies that received federal bailout money or in which the United States has an equity interest. Sens. Max Baucus, D-Montana, and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, are the chairman and top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, respectively. They said companies would not be allowed to restructure the payments to those executives through deferred compensation to avoid the tax. Grassley and Baucus said all retention bonuses would be subject to a 35 percent excise tax for excessive compensation to be paid by the company and an additional 35 percent tax to be paid by the individual. ""Millions of Americans are losing their jobs -- millions. And to some degree, they're losing their jobs because of actions taken by some of these firms,"" Baucus said. ""At the same time, they're giving themselves bonuses. I mean, give me a break. What are these people thinking? That's part of the problem. They're not thinking."" All other nonretention bonuses of more than $50,000 would be subject to the same tax, the senators said. ""We're trying to address what I think taxpayers would say is salt in their wounds,"" Grassley said. ""The taxpayers are bearing a great deal to get this economy going, help get these corporations turned around, and I think taxpayers are willing to help. ""But when they see the lack of sensitivity on the part of corporate directors -- by giving these bonuses and doing other outrageous things -- there's just so much that the taxpayers of this country are going to stand for."" The provisions would apply to bonuses paid out after January 1, 2009, so it would affect the AIG bonuses in question. ""We should not be here. We should not be in this position,"" Baucus said. ""AIG should not have promised those payments to retain those employees, and the Treasury should have blocked the issuance of the checks. It did not. And employees themselves should not have cashed them in. We should not be here, but unfortunately we are."" Senior Finance Committee aides said the senators had not yet worked out whether individuals would pay income tax on the bonuses as well as the proposed excise tax, or if a combination of the two would be used.  Watch why Americans are angry » . ""You'll have to wait to see when we introduce the legislation,"" one of the aides said. ""If our bosses had made a decision, we'd tell you what it was,"" said another.  See a snapshot of facts, attitudes and analysis on the recession » . On Monday, President Obama said he planned to attempt to block bonuses to executives at ailing insurance giant AIG, payments he described as an ""outrage."" Obama said he asked Geithner to ""pursue every single legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole."" Obama said he would work with Congress to change the laws so that such a situation cannot happen again.  Watch Obama say he's outraged by bonuses » . The president spared AIG CEO Edward Liddy from criticism, saying he got the job ""after the contracts that led to these bonuses were agreed to last year."" But he said the impropriety of the bonuses goes beyond economics. ""It's about our fundamental values,"" he said. iReport.com: Sound off on AIG .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A series of major international sporting events, a weak currency and its perennially sunny perch on the tip of South Africa are making Cape Town one of the hottest sailing destinations of 2009. Lucky strike: The port city of Cape Town is set to benefit from several major sporting events . The Indian Premier League cricket tournament was recently relocated to South Africa because of security concerns, and now Cape Town is slated to host the opening match on April 18. Both the Lions Tour rugby and the FIFA Confederations Cup football will follow the cricket tournament, heading down to South Africa later this year. Combined with the arrival of the World Cup in 2010, South Africa has suddenly become the ultimate holiday spot for sports fans. Calvyn Gilfellan, chief executive of Cape Town Routes Unlimited -- the region's tourism board -- told CNN the boost to the region had arrived at a crucial time. ""When the financial crisis started people went into gloom and doom but these events are helping a lot to restore confidence in the industry. ""The fact that we have a positive exchange rate also helps us a lot as a destination,"" he said. But South Africa's government is so focused on ensuring the success of the upcoming games that it recently denied a visa to The Dalai Lama. Critics contend that South Africa bowed to pressure from the Chinese government in refusing Tibet's spiritual leader entry to attend a peace conference that was partially intended to help promote the World Cup. As the focus strengthens on these international events, the Cape Town region looks set to benefit more than many from the expected surge in tourism. Gilfellan says this is largely due to the city's location. ""We are lucky to be in such a wonderful spot. A lot of these events revolve around the marine industry and revolve around the harbor."" This weekend harbor will play host to the Cape Town International Jazz Festival -- one of many upcoming festivals in the area. Cape Town's picturesque Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, set against the backdrop of Table Mountain, has become South Africa's most visited tourist attraction. Commodore of the Royal Cape Yacht Club (RCYC) John Martin, told CNN the Cape Town port was used widely for business, leisure and sports. As well as being the country's second biggest functioning port for trade, the port played host to racing yachts in events such as the Volvo Ocean Race and the Clipper Round-the-world Challenge. ""We have several major yachting events that stop here and we are very proud of that."" Martin said the popularity of the port means water space is ""at a premium,"" but there are hopes a new harbor and breakwater will be constructed in the next few years. Still, Cape Town has the capacity to cater for foreign visitors on super-yachts and international cruise-liners. ""Cape Town is a real focal point for refueling and repairs and it's also quite cheap here so people tend to stay for a while,"" he said. Gilfellan said she felt the surge of massive sporting events would undoubtedly have spin-off benefits for the marine industry. The Indian Premier League Twenty20 cricket, which starts this month, had been tipped to go to England, but ultimately South Africa was chosen for its sunny weather. The tournament, which will feature 59 matches across six venues, will run from 18 April to 24 May . The 2009 British and Irish Lions tour officially kicks off on May 30 in Rustenberg. Matches will be held in Cape Town on June 13 and June 23. The eight-team Confederations Cup runs from June 14-28, and will take place across four cities. The event marks the first time an African nation will host an international FIFA tournament. The landmark event foreshadows the much-anticipated World Cup football tournament in June 2010, for which qualifying matches are currently being held. Although that's still a year away -- there are signs that the excitement in South Africa is already palpable. A new television commercial that began airing last month features Spain and Liverpool star, Fernando Torres, and Brazilian icon Kaka showing off their football skills. The advertisement ends with Torres saying ""Ke Nako"", which in South Africa's Sotho language means ""it's time."" It seems for Cape Town and the whole country -- this could not be more true.

"(CNN) -- Asia's economic growth will tumble to the slowest pace since the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in a report released Tuesday. Customers buy vegetables at a market in Quezon City in suburban Manila, Philippines, on September 16. ""The short term outlook for the region is bleak as the full impact of the severe recession in industrialized economies is transmitted to emerging markets,"" said Jong-Wha Lee, acting chief economist for the ADB. The Asian Development Outlook 2009 forecasts that economic growth in developing Asia will slip to 3.4 percent in 2009, down from 6.3 percent last year and 9.5 percent in 2007. Growth could improve to 6 percent in 2010, if the global economy experiences a mild recovery next year, the report says. ""The concern for the region, and especially for the region's poor, is that it is not yet clear that the [United States], European Union and Japan will recover as soon as next year,"" Lee said. The slowdown should prompt Asian countries to expand their economic base and not be as dependent on exports, according to the report. Despite the downturn, the report says Asia is in a much better position to cope with the current crisis than it was in the late 1990s. ""Large foreign currency reserves and steadily declining inflation rates will provide policymakers with the necessary tools to nurse their economies through the hard times ahead,"" the report said. A number of Asian governments, including China, Japan and South Korea, have already responded quickly to the global financial crisis with stimulus packages and changes in monetary policy, helping to stem some of the downturn. In November, China announced plans to inject $586 billion (4 trillion yuan) into its economy to offset declines in industrial and export growth. That economic stimulus plan included the loosening of credit restrictions, tax cuts and massive infrastructure spending.","Economic growth in developing Asia forecast to slip to 3.4 percent in 2009 .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama met with his NATO allies in Strasbourg, France on Friday to talk about his plans for the war in Afghanistan, his ""front line in the war on terror."" Protesters outside the White House in February have a simple idea for the controversial prison. But the U.S. war on terror has some dark secrets and Obama hasn't really wanted to talk about them. In Spain, a crusading judge named Baltasar Garzon is reviewing the case of several men who say they were tortured at the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In Washington, Senator Patrick Leahy has been asking similar questions that people around the world want answered: . Did the U.S. really torture prisoners, did it secretly transfer some to other countries specifically to be tortured and did senior officials authorize it? Leahy says: ""We can't turn the page unless we first read the page."" There are ample grounds to believe crimes were committed. Individual prisoners have described being tortured in U.S. custody or being dispatched to other nations with the same terrible result. An investigation by the International Committee of the Red Cross also reported evidence of it. While he was in office, George W. Bush said flatly ""the United States does not torture."" But the Bush administration defined 'torture' so narrowly that its use of the word has been contested as well. The effort to find out just what happened has been moving slowly, both inside and outside the United States. The Obama administration hasn't encouraged it. Obama said recently that ""generally speaking, I'm more interested in looking forward than looking backwards."" That's easy to understand. Millions of Americans are grateful to America's ex-president and his aides, as well as U.S. soldiers and spies, for keeping the country safe after 9/11. Any investigations or potential prosecutions could set off a national debate complicating everything else Obama wants to accomplish. But the U.S. has signed international treaties on torture and war crimes, suggesting it's legally obligated to prosecute any cases that come to light. Countries in Europe, Africa and the Americas have found a way to face their secret crimes. The United States has to decide if it wants to take its own turn.","Leading figures in U.S., Europe want the U.S. to answer torture allegations .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Suits were swapped for jeans and sneakers throughout London's financial district today, as bankers heeded warnings to dress down to avoid the potential wrath of G-20 protestors. Bankers in London head to work in casual attire. Many city workers have been urged to dress down to avoid attention from protesters. ""Only about 20 percent of people probably just refused to dress down. Everybody else is in jeans,"" said Jesse Feldman, a banker at French investment bank, Société Générale. All week banks and investment firms located in London's City neighborhood have been advising employees to not dress in regular business attire. ""Staff are permitted to wear casual clothing -- jeans/trainers -- commencing March 30. Avoid briefcases/branded bags/computer cases: Put materials in rucksacks or carrier bags where possible,"" U.S. bank, J.P. Morgan told employees in an email statement last week quoted on City news Web site Hereisthecity.com. Employees at Rothschild investment bank in London were told simply not to bother coming into work at all today. Among those who did commute to the office, bystanders said that the bankers are still easy to spot, conspicuously reading UK newspaper The Financial Times or dressing in a uniform business casual look. ""On the tube this morning I thought it was ridiculous because all these bankers couldn't have looked more like bankers trying to dress down,"" Feldman told CNN. Instead of jackets, ties and Oxford shoes, polo shirts, khakis and loafers now fill the streets around the City and much of central London. ""I saw two bankers wearing matching baby blue sweaters, tight jeans and Church's -- ridiculous,"" Feldman added, referring to the up-scale brand of traditional English shoes. One Web site that covers news and gossip in the City has been tracking the banker backlash to the warnings. ""It's a mixture: people are falling into two types. The banks and the funds are certainly encouraging the staff to wear casual dress, but some are determined they won't cower to protestors and are still showing up in suits,"" said Vic Daniels, publisher of HereistheCity.com. On Monday, Bloomberg quoted one City professional, Graham Williams, 66, who said: ""We're not pansies ... most of us have played rugby or boxed. ""If any of those guys do get violent against us individually because we are wearing a suit, we will take action."" The site also offers humorous advice for bankers to respond to protestors by dumping ""large blocks of ice"" to ""render them harmless,"" and encouraging bankers to ""find your inner G20 [sic] spot."" Despite the jokes, precautions proved valuable Wednesday as thousands of angry anti-capitalist protestors converged on the City for demonstrations to coincide with the G-20 summit. By midday protestors had started smashing windows at a branch The Royal Bank of Scotland. Earlier in the day 11 people were arrested after being stopped in an armored personnel carrier. Thousands of police are continuing to patrol the streets in anti-riot gear.","Fearing protesters bankers dressed down for work in London today .

"ESTERO, Florida (CNN)   -- Alana and Joe Consolo should have had the excitement of a young couple enjoying their first house, but the South Florida pair was walking through it recently with a healthy dose of fear. Alana and Joe Consolo tour their Florida house after it was gutted because of concerns about the drywall. They've been caught in a maelstrom of headline news events that would make your head spin. Both were laid off as the economy soured. The nation's housing crisis cut their Florida house's value in half. And now their home's interior is being rebuilt because it contained Chinese-made drywall that they say has made them sick. The Consolos are among homeowners in several states who allege Chinese drywall has emitted corrosive gases they believe have given them headaches and upper respiratory problems and caused household systems such as air-conditioning units to fail. ""I'm holding back tears,"" Alana Consolo said as she walked through the house, which is in the middle of the reconstruction project. ""I have chills and I'm angry -- really, really angry -- and really sad, too."" The Consolos moved into the home in Estero, near Fort Myers, less than three years ago. But they moved out six weeks ago, and even though it's being rebuilt, they doubt they'll return there to live because they've yet to be convinced they'd be healthy. ""The last time that we saw the house in this condition,"" Alana said, looking at the gutted interior, ""we came in excited, holding our hands, planning on where we were going to put our [baby] room for our new family.""  Watch the Consolos tour the gutted home » . Concerns about Chinese-made drywall emerged in Florida last year but by now have spread to other states. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said it's investigating complaints in Florida, Virginia, Alabama, Louisiana, Washington and North Carolina. And class-action lawsuits are lining up against Chinese manufacturers as well as suppliers and builders. The Florida Department of Health said complaints it received -- more than 180 as of Thursday -- generally involve homes built between 2004 and 2007, around the time that a building boom and post-hurricane reconstruction caused a U.S. drywall shortage and spurred imports from China. A study done for the Florida department by private laboratory Unified Engineering Inc. found that samples of certain Chinese drywall gave off a sulfurous odor from ""volatile sulfur compounds"" when exposed to extreme heat and moisture. It also found that vapors ""in the residential atmosphere created a corrosive environment in the presence of moisture,"" according to Unified's report. But state and federal officials said they're still testing to determine whether the drywall poses health risks. The Consolos, who now have a 4-month-old daughter, said they first noticed a problem in December when their smoke detectors kept going off inexplicably. An inspection revealed that copper wiring inside the house had turned black. And the couple said they suffered from headaches and upper respiratory problems while living in the house. So they moved out. Now the house, which had Chinese-made drywall, has been stripped. The builder, Lennar Homes, is footing the bill for the reconstruction and a nearby rental house for the Consolos. Moving out came at a trying time for the family. Both were laid off about a year ago by Countrywide Bank, where they were mortgage loan originators. Joe Consolo is now a restaurant manager. Also, the nation's housing crisis hit their home. Purchased for $528,000, it has recently been appraised for $280,000. Trying to get out from under a bad investment, they went to their bank to do a short sale. ""The value had decreased so much, we were throwing money out the window,"" Alana Consolo said. Two offers for $250,000 and $255,000 were rejected. So, they made a business decision: They stopped paying their mortgage and declared bankruptcy. The Consolos are now three months behind in their payments. They're not sure yet if foreclosure is in their future, but they don't think it will be easy to sell a house that's had drywall issues. The Gypsum Association said that enough drywall was imported from China since 2006 to build 30,000 complete homes. Most of the Chinese drywall, it said, ended up in southwest Florida during the housing boom. As for the Consolos' health problems, Alana said her headaches stopped after they moved out of the house. Joe said he's been hospitalized twice for pneumonia, and he's been diagnosed with lupus, an autoimmune disease of the blood. The Consolos said they believe drywall was the cause. Lennar Homes, the Consolos' builder, said it has identified at least 80 homes it built with Chinese drywall. It is offering to gut and rebuild those homes for free. ""They're doing what's responsible, we believe,"" Alana Consolo said. ""We're repairing the homes by removing every piece of drywall from the home and replacing all affected copper,"" said Chris Marlin, a vice president for Lennar Homes. Lennar also is suing Chinese manufacturers and their U.S. suppliers. But while the Consolos' home is being rebuilt, their lives still are filled with stress and unanswered questions. They said they think foreclosure may be the best way to get away from a house that they think has made them sick and that they don't believe they could sell because of the housing crisis and drywall issues. ""There's the fear, 'Are they taking everything out?' "" Alana Consolo said. ""We want to have more children, and Joe has an autoimmune disorder. [Going back is] just a risk I'm not willing to take."" She added, ""The economy started it. The Chinese drywall cemented it for us.""","Florida couple's house being revamped; they say Chinese drywall made them sick .

"(CNN) -- Arctic reindeer herders in northern Scandinavia are getting a view from space to help them look after their herds as the region copes with climate change. Snow worries: Satellite maps of snow coverage and melt can help reindeer herders. Using satellite-based snow melt maps supplied by the European Space Agency (ESA) backed program Polar View, herders are able to view the depth of snow and judge where the best foraging spots are to take their reindeer. ""Snow is of paramount importance for reindeer herding, because its quality determines whether reindeer are able to access the pastures that lie beneath it for much of the year,"" Anders Oskal, the Director of the International Center for Reindeer Husbandry (ICR) told the ESA. ""Detailed circumpolar snow information is, thus, becoming increasingly important following the recent changes in the Arctic climate."" Oskal is working with Sámi reindeer herders in Finnmark, Norway, to help them maintain and develop sustainable reindeer husbandry. According to Oskal, Finnmark is the area of Norway that is predicted to experience the largest temperature increases, raising concerns about whether ice layers will form over pastures preventing reindeer from foraging. Under the Polar View initiative, Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) have been providing snow melt maps for Norway and Sweden, as well as snow cover maps for Eurasia, for the last 18 months. The ICR partnered with Polar View in a trial of the maps to examine how satellite observations could help by gathering information on snow change in a timely manner for such vast circumpolar regions. ""The experience so far has definitely been positive, and the reindeer herders are extremely interested in the future utilization of Polar View products that can relate important information about local snow conditions,"" said Oskal. ""These products could have important consequences for herders' decisions regarding winter pasture quality and potential migration routes."" In addition to climate change, reindeer herders also have to face a loss of pastures because of infrastructure development, such as roads, hydroelectric power dams and cabin resorts. The same technology would help the ICR to monitor the different forms of land-use change over time.","Sámi herders using satellite-based maps of snow to judge best areas .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Actress Demi Moore's frequent postings on Twitter put her in the middle of a life-and-death drama Friday when a woman sent her an online message threatening suicide. Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore are both active members of the Twitter social-networking site. Moore, who was in southern France where her husband, actor Ashton Kutcher, is filming a movie, quickly replied to the threat saying, ""Hope you are joking."" Twitter followers who saw the message tracked it to a San Jose, California, home, where police found a 48-year-old woman. The police took her into custody for a psychological evaluation, according to a police spokesman. About two hours after the initial exchange, Moore posted this message -- known as a ""tweet"" -- on Twitter: ""Thanks everyone for reaching out to the San Jose PD i am told they are aware and no need to call anymore. I do not know this woman."" A San Jose police spokesman said a ""concerned citizen"" -- not Moore or Kutcher -- called his department at 4:37 a.m. to report seeing the threat on Twitter. Police went to the residence that the caller provided and found the woman unharmed but in need of help, Sgt. Ronnie Lopez said. ""We determined she did meet the criteria for a 72-hour psychological evaluation, and she was taken to a hospital for that treatment,"" Lopez said. Both Moore and Kutcher post tweets from their cell phones several times a day. Kutcher has 675,000 subscribers following his Twitter postings, while 380,000 have signed up to follow Moore. Twitter attracts many readers who enjoy seeing the behind-the-scenes writing, photos and video from celebrities who have embraced the social-network technology. This unusual access also allows subscribers to send messages to celebrities, who sometimes reply. The original tweet to Moore on Friday, which was still online several hours later, read: ""getting a knife,a big one that is sharp. Going to cut my arm down the whole arm so it doesn't waste time."" Moore, who apparently knew others were trying to locate the person who wrote it, tweeted that she ""was very torn about responding or retweeting that woman's post but felt uncomfortable just letting it go."" She assured readers that ""the twitterverse is on the case."" Two hours after the first message, Moore wrote: ""And if it is a joke it is not funny and nor is this an appropriate outlet for such a serious matter Time for us to move on."" Her husband, who is known as a constant tweeter, posted his own praise of Moore: ""Wifey is pretty amazing, huh?"" ""Lot of pain in the world...

"(AOL Autos) -- Big Al, the used car dealer with that small lot down on the corner, may be your mother's cousin, but that doesn't mean you'll get the best used car deal in town from him. He sells all brands of cars, has no visible shop or mechanical staff, and he is the only one that stands behind the quality of his cars ... until the rear tires clear his driveway. The numbers of items inspected on the cars range from 100 to 300. A better used car? If shopping for regular used cars, whether it be at a dealer or private party, just isn't cutting it for you, there may be a better solution -- choosing to buy from a new-car dealer who also operates a Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) used car program. These programs are operated jointly by the manufacturer and the dealer, and practically guarantee the quality, condition, and future long life of the car, truck, crossover, or SUV you're interest in. It's in the dealer's and the manufacturer's best interest to find the best used cars available for these programs, so most of the cars sold through them are clean, undamaged cars coming off of two- or three-year leases or out of rental-car fleet service. Restrictions on which vehicles are allowed in the program, such as age and mileage, vary. Some cars in CPO programs could be as young as six months and have only 6000 miles on them, as in BMW's program, and others could be as much as five years old and have a maximum of 80,000 miles on the odometer, in the case of Volvo. Inspection and warranty . Although the content and extent of each brand's certified pre-owned program varies, one of the constants is the complete vehicle inspection offered by every program. Though the number of items -- or points -- inspected on the vehicle varies from 100 to 300, as a consumer you should feel comfortable knowing that everything important on the car was inspected by the dealer, under the guidelines of the manufacturer, and the worn or bad parts were replaced, if necessary, before the vehicle was put into the program. Aside from the inspections, the length and coverage of the certified-vehicle warranty also varies from program to program, and the buyer should make absolutely sure that the original manufacturer is offering the warranty, as opposed to a third-party or extended-warranty company. Depending on a vehicle's age, condition and mileage, it may in fact be cheaper to buy an uncertified used car from a dealer and then purchase a separate extended warranty for the vehicle. The CPO bumper-to-bumper warranties can be a bit complicated, so be sure to do your homework and become familiar with all the ins-and-outs. Some of the warranties start when the car is sold to you, and some warranties start from the date of the original sale or in-service date of the vehicle, but are extended up to six years or 100,000 miles. Certified used car buyers should be sure to read and understand every paragraph of the vehicle and powertrain warranties offered with the vehicle so there are no surprises later. Some warranties also require the buyer to pay a predetermined deductible amount for each repair; some don't (BMW, for instance, charges a flat fee of $50 for any warranty repair). Some CPO warranties are even transferable to the next owner after you, which may be an attraction when it comes time to sell it. In most cases, the original long-term powertrain and corrosion penetration warranty will still apply. You also get perks . Beyond the usual vehicle inspection thoroughness and the length of the certified-vehicle warranty, the various manufacturers and dealers offer a large menu of extras on their certified pre-owned vehicles as enticements to a deal. What if you buy a CPO vehicle, load your kids into it, and it stops running halfway to grandma's house? Most programs offer 24/7 roadside assistance for such situations on a CPO vehicle (Hyundai, for instance, offers this feature for a full ten years and unlimited mileage from the original in-service date). Some offer temporary vehicle loans while your vehicle is being repaired. Others go even further than that, offering trip interruption insurance that will pay you up to $1,500 toward your living expenses while your CPO vehicle is being repaired and/or partial reimbursement for a taxi, shuttle or rental car during the repair period. What if you sign on the bottom line, take the vehicle home, and nobody likes it? Some companies offer a no-strings return policy after three days or 150 miles of home-based test driving (Mercedes-Benz offers seven days and 500 miles). Others offer special financing rates on CPO vehicles to make the deal as attractive as possible. Another potential deal-sealer is a free Carfax report on the car before you buy it, a feature offered by Lexus. A few CPO programs include the Carfax Buyback Guarantee as well. Still other goodies could include free lock-out service, free car washes on each warranty visit, and preferential treatment in the service queue. Infiniti offers free tire changing, lock-out, jump start, an oil filter change, and emergency fuel delivery in addition to other benefits. Others offer free trip routing and maps. Jaguar, for instance, sweetens its deals with British Airways companion tickets, free membership in the Hertz #1 Club, free magazines, and a Jaguar club liaison. It's all there, in the fine print. Is it worth it? Due to the costs involved in the inspection, certification and warranties process, a certified used car will almost always be more expensive than a normal used car or one from a private party out of the classifieds. How much more? From two to eight percent higher, according to Kelley Blue Book research. Premium-brand vehicles will be priced even higher because there are more items to warranty on a luxury car than there are on a basic Chevrolet or Ford. But, look at it this way: You can get a thoroughly inspected and guaranteed, slightly used two-to-five-year-old vehicle for far less money than you'd have to pay for it new. Add to that attractive interest rates, with lots of extra perks in the deal, including the security of a longer warranty. Can Big Al match that? We don't think so.

"(CNN) -- A car bomb exploded Saturday in Somalia's capital, killing 15 people and wounding 24, a government spokesman said. Gunfighting has plagued the streets of Somalia's capital in recent months, stalling efforts to restore order. The car was heading toward headquarters of the African Union Mission in Somalia in late morning when a bomb went off before it reached the building, which is guarded by police, Abdi Gobdon said. The attack also threatened a group of nearby African Union peacekeepers. African Union Commission Chairman Jean Ping condemned the ""cowardly and terrorist"" suicide attack in Mogadishu, which he said comes during a time of ""renewed efforts to further peace and reconciliation"" to the troubled nation. Somalia has been wracked by violence and lawlessness since the government was overthrown in 1991. A drought and high food and fuel prices also have increased the need for humanitarian assistance. iReport.com: Are you there? Share your story . On Saturday, various officials met in Djibouti with the aim of expanding the Somalian parliament and electing a president for the Transitional Federal Government, Ping said. The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution January 16 expressing its intent to send U.N. peacekeeping forces back to the unstable nation, and the AU plans to send additional troops to Somalia in coming weeks, Ping said. The United Nations' World Food Programme considered suspending delivery of food to Somalia after the killings of two aid workers in early January but then decided that would hurt the very people the program is trying to help.","African Union official condemns attack that also wounded 24 .

"This story is part of an ongoing series of profiles by CNN about economic survival in this time of financial crisis. Leah Bird and her husband Ed Wright stand in front of their new home: a 1974 Airstream trailer. (CNN) -- They bid farewell to their beloved trips to the opera and museum, the beach and Buddhist temples. They ate one last time at their favorite restaurants serving Indian curried chicken and warm bowls of Vietnamese pho. Leah Bird and her husband, Ed Wright, have traded their comfortable two-bedroom apartment and jobs in Beverly Hills, California, for life in a trailer on a five-acre Oregon farm. No longer do the couple hear roaring fire trucks in the street or chatter from patrons dining at outdoor cafes. On this farm, the dominant silence is occasionally interrupted by the sounds of frogs and crickets. ""It's not necessarily a lifestyle that has ever seemed attractive to me,"" says 28-year-old Bird, between tending to the farm animals: two sheep, two Nubian goats, miniature horses and geese. ""I always saw myself as more of a metropolitan person, but you know, without money, this was our best option."" The couple's drastic lifestyle change -- one they chose -- came last October when Wright, 48, lost his job managing life insurance portfolios for millionaires at a private firm in Beverly Hills. His niche company, which relied heavily on capital flow, had felt the pain of the credit crunch. Once making over $100,000 a year, Wright soon joined the growing number of Americans facing unemployment in the economic downturn. iReport.com: Tell us how you're surviving . With meager savings, Bird and Wright knew they couldn't maintain their costly Los Angeles lifestyle in an area where, they say, image is everything. Even if they had stayed in Beverly Hills, they would have needed to move into a smaller apartment and rely on Bird's modest salary as a financial manager. Exhausted from the rat race, Wright decided they needed another option. ""I've been in Los Angeles for a long time and I've had to start over before,"" Wright says. ""You spend two or three years getting back on your feet and then what? It's a struggle if you aren't making a lot of money."" Then Wright's parents offered to let the newlywed couple live on their family farm in rural Douglas County in southern Oregon until the couple bounced back. Wright agreed immediately. He says he wanted to move there to help his elderly parents manage the sprawling property. His wife, however, was more reluctant because she still had her job. But Bird says she soon agreed to move to the farm because it was the fastest way to cut expenses. ""I did it out of immediate necessity,"" says Bird, who grew up in more of a suburban setting near Tucson, Arizona. ""I don't think I was ready to leave L.A."" While Wright wanted to make the move north, he wasn't ready to move in with his parents. At Christmas, the couple purchased a 1974 Airstream trailer, shaped like an oblong silver bullet, from Craigslist for a few thousand dollars. The trailer living quarters are cramped, with about 300 square feet, a major downgrade from the couple's 1,400-square-foot apartment in California. iReport.com: From Beverly Hills to Hillbillies . The couple moved to Oregon in mid-January, after a two-day drive from Los Angeles, hopeful the farm would give them the needed break from city life and a chance to focus on finding new careers. In Los Angeles, they lived in a neighborhood with about 20,000 people. Now, the closest town has fewer than 20,000 people. ""We're not going to lie to you and say everything is hunky dory,"" Wright says. ""It's hard being out here."" ""I feel like a fish out of water,"" Bird added. ""I'm so out of my element."" Their mornings now begin at the crack of dawn. They clean the living space for the animals, pick up manure and fix the landscaping. Afternoons are spent job hunting, a challenging feat in a region where lumber and nursing are the two dominant fields. For now, they are spending their savings until they find employment. Their trailer's bedroom has just enough room to stuff in a queen-size bed. A narrow window by the bed looks out on the farm, where they can see deer roaming the land in the mornings. There is no dining room, a difficult adjustment for the couple, who once enjoyed entertaining guests over dinner and wine. The living room furniture consists of colorful pillows piled against the wall on the floor facing the television and a desk for their laptops. Their new kitchen has just enough space for one person to stand and work. There is one toilet , which is currently being remodeled, and no shower. The couple bathe at Wright's parents' house; they admit that they only shower a few times a week now. Most of their belongings from Los Angeles, expensive furniture and art accumulated over the years, remain in storage. While the couple miss these things, they say their new lifestyle will help them survive the troubled economy. They also hope it will teach them to live simpler lives. In many ways, Bird and Wright are enjoying the serenity of their slower-paced lifestyle. They are spending more time together, and Bird says she is getting closer to Wright's parents. After the initial culture shock in the first month, Bird says she is slowly adapting to farm life. She learned how to build a fire pit, and she plans on growing a fruit and vegetable garden in the spring. She wants to buy more productive animals like cows. With the garden and some cows, she says, the couple won't have to purchase vegetables or milk from the grocery store. Her husband is remodeling their trailer by adding amenities to the kitchen and bathroom. Wright, who has always been interested in philosophy and religion, says he sees his unemployment as a time for ""soul searching."" The couple are still mulling their career options. Wright, who is also an amateur musician, is looking at new job opportunities for the future. He has dabbled with the idea of starting his own bar since he knows so many musicians in the industry, he says. He and his wife are thinking about joining the Peace Corps together, or maybe building a log house on the farm. The options are limitless, they say. A few weeks ago, surrounded by giant pine trees in the cold winter air, the couple walked outside and looked up. For the first time in a long time, they could see the stars shining brightly in the dark sky. CNN's Shirley Zilberstein contributed to this report.","Leah Bird and Ed Wright have have traded their Beverly Hills life for a trailer on a farm .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sometimes, a T-shirt just doesn't cut it. Allie Tompkins, 19, gets her first tattoo at Fatty's Tattooz on Monday. For those who want a more permanent way to showcase their support for Barack Obama, Washington's tattoo parlors are ready to help. ""There's nothing more memorable than a tattoo,"" said Matt Jessup, better known as ""Fatty,"" the owner of Fatty's Custom Tattooz and Body Piercing. His shop is celebrating what it has dubbed the ""Obamathan,"" where customers can get a free ""Obama '08"" logo tattoo if they buy another tattoo worth $200. The Obama tattoo, Fatty says, is worth $70. ""A lot of people are feeling very inspired and taken by this moment in our nation's history. And for many people, they are in town for this historic event, they want something to remember it by,"" he said. At Fatty's and other tattoo shops in the area, there have been multiple inquiries about getting inked with an Obama image, they say, but only a few people have actually gone through with. The most popular choices so far have been the Obama logo, the word ""hope,"" and the now iconic red-and-blue Obama hope poster by Shepard Fairey. T.J. Mohler, who works at Jinx Proof Tattoos, said business has been up as people flood the city, but only ""about two or three"" customers have gotten an Obama tattoo. One of those people is Mohler himself, who opted for a 5 x 7-inch Obama image on his leg. ""When I look back in 50 years, it will remind me of the time and how excited everyone is,"" Mohler said. None of the shop owners reported any history of George W. Bush tattoos. ""No such thing,"" said Jason Anthony, owner of Midtown Tattoo. Fatty says he's hoping the number of people getting Obama art will grow as more visitors arrive and word about the Obamathon gets out. ""We're still rolling with it through the week, so I'm hoping that we'll get more interest,"" he said. On Wednesday, Fatty has plans to tattoo a portrait of Obama's face on one customer. That piece of art is worth $600, but the customer is getting it for free because she was the winner of one of the shop's promotions. But for those wary of permanent ink, there are some alternatives available. Glam Rock Art is a Washington business specializing in airbrush tattoos and body art. Owner and artist Nicole Graves has ordered custom Obama stencils in response to requests from customers. Fatty's also offers a removable option -- the Obama piercing. It's an orbital ring with a blue bead that costs $44, in honor of the 44th president. And if a customer has a change of heart post-tattoo, Fatty says all is not lost. ""Come on back and I'll cover it up with something else,"" he said.","Tattoo parlors offering permanent memories of Barack Obama's inauguration .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Thousands of documents about reported UFO sightings -- ranging from calm accounts by professional pilots to unhinged rants about the extraterrestrial menace -- have been released by the British Ministry of Defence. Taiwan resident Lee Chun-hung took these pictures showing a ball of fire trailing across the sky. The 4,500 pages cover sightings that were reported from 1986 through 1992. The British military released them to a curious public as part of a four-year project to transfer all such documents to the National Archives. One highlight from the batch released Monday involves the captain of an Italian airliner. He shouted ""Look out!"" to his co-pilot in April 1991 after claiming to see a beige ""missile-shaped object"" shoot past the cockpit. In that instance, the defence ministry ruled out a missile and ""all the usual explanations,"" wrote David Clarke, a UFO expert and journalism instructor at Sheffield Hallam University, who worked with the National Archives to prepare the new materials for release. ""The end result was this was a genuine UFO and the file was simply closed,"" he wrote. ""There was nothing more they could do."" The newly released documents also carry an account by a U.S. Air Force pilot who says he was told to shoot down an unidentified flying craft over eastern England. But before he could fire, the object disappeared. The next day, a man arrived to debrief the pilot and ""he was told in no uncertain terms that what he had seen on his radar was top secret and he wasn't to speak about it to anyone,"" Clarke wrote. The first set of files was made available to members of the public in May. It covered reported UFO sightings from 1978 to 1987, and included hundreds of police reports taken from witnesses who described seeing lights or strange objects in the sky. People who reported having seen UFOs typically describe various shapes and colors of lights, moving in formation or hovering in the sky. Witnesses reported orange, red, white and green lights that were diamond-shaped, square, or cigar-shaped. They reported them to police, who have a standard 16-question form specifically for UFO sightings. ""The vast majority of them are just ordinary people who've seen something unusual and thought that they ought to tell someone about it,"" Clarke has said. The Ministry of Defence said it examined the reports solely to determine whether enemy aircraft had infiltrated British airspace. Once it was determined that no enemy aircraft were in the sky, it did not investigate further. ""The Ministry of Defence has no other interest or role regarding UFO matters and does not consider questions regarding the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial life-forms,"" it said in May. That left many incidents unexplained.","Documents about reported UFO sightings released by UK defense officials .

"(CNN) -- Just like some U.S. officials looking into the mystery, the man who captured video of an apparent fireball plunging from the sky over Texas on Sunday is perplexed about what it was. Video captured in Austin, Texas, shows a meteor-like object in the sky Sunday morning. ""I don't know what I saw in the sky. It was something burning and falling really fast,"" Eddie Garcia, a videographer for News 8 Austin, told CNN Monday. ""I'm looking in the viewfinder and I see, just, something flying through the sky. And it kind of looks like it could be dust, it could be something, and then I look up and, no, it was something burning in the sky,"" he said. ""And you know, this is something that you see at night clearly during a meteor shower or something like that, but you don't see something like that during the day."" Authorities in Texas said there were reports of sonic booms in the area Sunday as well.  Watch video of meteor-like fireball » . Early speculation was that it might have been debris from two satellites -- one American, one Russian -- that rammed into each other in space a week ago. But the U.S. Strategic Command, which tracks satellite debris, said it was not. ""There is no correlation between those reports and any of that debris from the collision,"" command spokeswoman Maj. Regina Winchester told CNN Monday. So what was it? ""I don't know,"" she responded. ""It's possible it was some kind of natural phenomenon, maybe a meteor."" Meteor fireballs bright enough to be seen in the daytime are rare but not unheard of. Two of the most recent fell in October in the Alice Springs region of Australia and last June just west of Salt Lake City, Utah. The one over Australia was unique because the asteroid that caused it was discovered and tracked before it reached Earth's atmosphere, according to the Sydney Observatory's Web site. It says the asteroid was about 6.5 feet wide. A sonic boom also was heard in connection with that event, the Australian observatory says. On Friday, the National Weather Service reported that its office in Jackson, Kentucky, had received calls about ""possible explosions"" or ""earthquakes"" in that area. ""The Federal Aviation Administration has reported to local law enforcement that these events are being caused by falling satellite debris,"" the service said Friday. ""These pieces of debris have been causing sonic booms, resulting in the vibrations being felt by some residents, as well as flashes of light across the sky. The cloud of debris is likely the result of the recent in-orbit collision of two satellites on Tuesday February 10, when Kosmos 2251 crashed into Iridium 33."" CNN's call Monday to NASA to get its take on the fireball over Texas was not immediately returned. Garcia said he had been told NASA may have called him. The FAA had asked pilots Saturday to keep an eye out for ""falling space debris,"" warning that ""a potential hazard may occur due to re-entry of satellite debris into the Earth's atmosphere."" FAA spokesman Roland Herwig said Sunday there had been no reports of ground strikes or interference with aircraft in flight. He said the FAA had received no reports from pilots in the air of any sightings, but had gotten ""numerous"" calls from people on the ground in Texas, from Dallas south to Austin. As of Monday morning, Herwig said his agency had no information about what the fireball was. iReport.com: Did you see the fireball? Send photos, video . He also said the FAA had rescinded its warning to pilots to look out for space debris. Garcia, the videographer, was out covering a marathon race Sunday morning when he caught a glimpse of the blaze. In the video, it appear as a meteor-like white fireball blazing across the clear sky. ""I remember shooting it and wondering what I shot, and then looking around and seeing if anyone saw it with me, and everyone was just focused on that marathon that we were shooting at the time,"" he told CNN Newsroom. Whatever it was, Garcia said he's ""just grateful I got a shot of it. And, hopefully, that'll help"" people figure out what it was.","Video shot in Austin, Texas, shows meteor-like object in sky Sunday morning .

"(CNN) -- David Beckham revealed that he has missed playing football ""at the highest level"" after being presented as an AC Milan player ahead of his three-month loan deal from the Los Angeles Galaxy. David Beckham parades his new AC Milan kit after completing his three-month loan to the Italian club. Beckham, 33, has negotiated a move to the Serie A giants in a bid to remain match fit and stay in the thoughts of England manager Fabio Capello. His move to LA Galaxy from Real Madrid last year was perceived at the time as a step backwards to a league that has still to establish itself on the world stage, and the former England captain admitted that a move to Milan represented a move back into the mainstream. ""Moving to America was a big step for me because there was a lot of people who were criticizing the move, but I still believe it was a move where I wanted to challenge myself and I was able to challenge myself in different ways,"" Beckham told a packed press conference in Milan. ""But I have always said that I would always miss playing at the highest level. I'm not saying that in America they won't get to the highest level -- it will take time and it will happen. But with five months off during the season I personally can't do that.

Beckham, who began the press conference by addressing the assembled media with a few words in Italian, will be in the stands to watch his new team take on Udinese on Sunday. He will then join them at a training camp in Dubai and could make his debut when the Serie A season resumes with a trip to Roma on January 11.

"(CNN) -- Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed said Saturday he will give in to a rebel demand that he impose Islamic law, or sharia, in an effort to halt fighting between Somali forces and Islamic insurgents. President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed  says sharia law in Somalia will not be strict. However, Ahmed told a news conference he won't agree to a strict interpretation of the law, which forbids girls from attending school, requires veils for women and beards for men, and bans music and television. The president, speaking at his palace in the capital, Mogadishu, said local elders and religious leaders, acting as liaisons with the militants, brought him a message saying the rebels wanted a truce in the two-year-old fighting. He also asked African peacekeepers to stand down. Ahmed, who was elected January 31, said he would ask the AU contingent to leave once there is a solid political solution to the conflict. More than 40,000 Somalis have returned to abandoned neighborhoods in Mogadishu over the past six weeks, despite some of the heaviest fighting in months, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday. They are part of the more than a million residents who have been displaced by fighting in Somalia, including 100,000 who fled to neighboring countries last year alone, according to the United Nations. Ethiopian troops entered the country at its request in December 2006. The Ethiopians ousted the Islamic Courts Union, an Islamic movement that had claimed control of Mogadishu earlier that year. Ethiopia's action had the blessing of the United States, which accused the Islamic Courts Union of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda. But various Islamist groups -- including al-Shabab, which the United States has designated a terror organization -- rejected the presence of Ethiopian forces and mounted an insurgent campaign against the Ethiopians and the transitional government.

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe described the U.S. government and Western nations as ""quite stupid and foolish"" Tuesday for trying to be involved in the African country's affairs. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has ignored international calls for him to step down. Mugabe made the comments at the funeral for a former senior soldier, just days after a top U.S. diplomat said the United States no longer supports a power-sharing deal between Mugabe and his political rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, that might pave the way for economic, health and other reforms. Jendayi Frazer, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said Sunday that the U.S. felt a viable unity government was not possible with Mugabe in power. At the funeral, Mugabe reacted: ""The inclusive government ... does not include Mr. Bush and his administration. It does not even know him. It has no relationship with him.  Watch U.S. say Mugabe needs to go » . ""So let him keep his comments to himself. They are undeserved, irrelevant and quite stupid and foolish. Who are they to decide who should be included or should not in an inclusive government?"" Mugabe and Tsvangirai, who leads the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, signed the unity deal September 15, but Mugabe's ZANU-PF party and the MDC have failed to implement it because they cannot agree on who should control key ministries. Under the power-sharing proposal brokered by former South African leader Thabo Mbeki, Mugabe would remain president while Tsvangirai would become prime minister.

The nation is facing acute shortages of fuel, electricity and medical drugs. The inflation rate -- the highest in the world -- is 231 million percent. Mugabe, referring to Bush's call for him to leave office, said: ""We realize that these are [the] last kicks of a dying horse. We obviously [are] not going to pay attention to a sunset administration. Zimbabwe's fate lies in the fate of Zimbabweans. They are the ones who make and unmake the leaders of the country.

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of people filled a college auditorium Wednesday to pay their last respects to an El Reno, Oklahoma, woman slain along with her four children last week. Summer Rust's children -- clockwise from top, Autumn, Kirsten, Evynn and Teagin -- carve pumpkins. About 300 people attended the service at Redlands Community College for Summer Rust, 25; her son, Teagin, 4; and daughters Evynn, 3, and Autumn and Kirsten, both 7, CNN affiliate KOCO reported. Rust's white coffin was placed in front of the podium, flanked by the smaller caskets carrying her children. Each casket had a picture of the victim, surrounded by flowers. A slide show of the family played on an overhead screen throughout the service. ""I've preached a lot of funerals, but none like this one,"" said the Rev. Gerald Van Horn. ""This has been on my heart ever since I heard about it. I first learned of it from the news, and I said, 'In El Reno? No way.' ... We don't have to deal with tragedy very often, but it has come, and the reality of it has sunk in. Searching my heart on what to say, I have found it difficult."" He told mourners that God is near and feels their pain but acknowledged that Rust and her children ""will be greatly missed."" The bodies were found January 12 in Rust's apartment in El Reno, about 30 miles west of Oklahoma City. According to the document, each of the victims was suffocated and strangled. Crime scene investigators said each body had ligature marks around the neck. Rust's boyfriend, Joshua Steven Durcho, 25, admitted choking her to death but said the children were not there at the time, according to an affidavit filed last week. He was arrested in Hamilton County, Texas, officials said. A spokeswoman at the Canadian County, Oklahoma, Sheriff's Office said Durcho was being held in the county jail after waiving extradition. Durcho's cousin found Rust's body and called officers, who found the children's bodies in the apartment, says an affidavit written by a special agent with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. An apparent acquaintance of Durcho's told police he came to her apartment Monday afternoon and told her he had ""choked"" Summer Rust to death and he was leaving Oklahoma, according to the affidavit. The affidavit says Durcho told the woman ""that the children were at their grandmother's residence ... while he and Summer worked out their relationship problems."" Rust's mother, Susan Rust of Carson City, Nevada, said Durcho was unemployed and had been living with Rust and her children. Authorities in Texas said Durcho was arrested after a state trooper attempted to stop his car because the trooper suspected that the driver was drunk. When the trooper ran the license plate on the car, it matched the tag number of a vehicle sought by Oklahoma police.","NEW: Preacher says he found funeral for mom, four kids ""difficult""

"(CNN)  -- The first-ever pictures of planets outside the solar system have been released in two studies. The box shows a planet orbiting the star Fomalhaut. The dot shows the star's location. Using the latest techniques in space technology, astronomers at NASA and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory used direct-imaging techniques to capture pictures of four newly discovered planets orbiting stars outside our solar system. ""After all these years, it's amazing to have a picture showing not one but three planets,"" said physicist Bruce Macintosh of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California. ""The discovery of the HR8799 system is a crucial step on the road to the ultimate detection of another Earth,"" he said. None of the planets is remotely habitable, scientists said. Both sets of research findings were published Thursday in Science Express, a journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. A team of American, British and Canadian astronomers and physicists, using the Gemini North and Keck telescopes on the Mauna Kea mountaintop in Hawaii, observed host star HR8799 to find three of the new planets. Scientists estimate that HR8799, roughly 1.5 times the size of the sun, is 130 light years from Earth in the constellation of Pegasus. The individual planets in this planetary family are estimated to be seven to 10 times the mass of Jupiter. Astronomers say the star is too faint to detect with the human eye, but observers could probably see it through binoculars or small telescopes. ""This discovery is the first time we have directly imaged a family of planets around a normal star outside of our solar system,"" said Christian Marois, the lead astronomer in the Lawrence Livermore lab study. About the same time, NASA astronomers using the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope surprised the space community by locating a fourth planet. NASA's newly discovered planet, Fomalhaut b, is estimated to be roughly three times Jupiter's mass and 10.7 billion miles from its host star, Fomalhaut. NASA's images show Fomalhaut b orbiting the bright southern star Fomalhaut, which is said to be 16 times brighter than our sun and 25 light years away in the constellation Piscis Australis (Southern Fish). ""Our Hubble observations were incredibly demanding. Fomalhaut b is 1 billion times fainter than the star,"" Hubble astronomer Paul Kalas said. ""We began this program in 2001, and our persistence finally paid off."" Previous planet-hunting efforts have relied on the traditional Doppler, or ""wobble,"" technique, which works by measuring the gravitational influence a planet exerts on its host, or parent, star. By studying these gravitational ""tug-of-wars,"" astronomers have been able to study a star's velocity or brightness to infer the presence of a planet. iReport.com: Are you an aspiring astronomer? Share your photos of space . To determine whether the faint objects orbiting HR8799 were indeed planets and not other stars, astronomers studying the three newly discovered planets (HR8799b, HR8799c and HR8799d) compared images from studies conducted in different years. In all the documented pictures, the three objects were found to be orbiting in a counter-clockwise direction around HR8799, proving that they were planets and not just background objects coincidentally aligned in the image. According to the the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia, there have been 322 planets found outside our solar system. The latest findings bring that total to 326. The extrasolar planets found have mostly been gaseous in their composition. Both studies indicate that direct-imaging techniques can only aid our efforts in one day finding an Earth-like planet.","Astronomers have new images of four likely planets outside Earth's solar system .

"Editor's note: Leslie Morgan Steiner is the author of ""Crazy Love,"" a new memoir about domestic violence, and the anthology ""Mommy Wars,"" which explores the polarization between stay-at-home and career moms. Leslie Morgan Steiner says domestic violence afflicts the well-to-do as well as the poor. (CNN) -- For two days, news reports called her ""the 20-year old victim"" allegedly attacked by R&B singer and dancer Chris Brown in his car early February 8 in Los Angeles, California. We all now have good reason to believe that the alleged victim was pop singer Rihanna, Brown's girlfriend. The story has dominated the general media with good reason. Both singers are young, apple-cheek gorgeous, immensely talented and squeaky clean -- the last couple you'd imagine as domestic violence headliners. Perhaps the only good that will come from the Rihanna/Brown publicity is destruction of our culture's misconception that abusers and their victims can only be universally poor, uneducated and powerless. Brown, whose first song debuted at No. 1 and whose first album topped the Billboard Hot 100, appeared on a Disney sitcom and in Sesame Street, Got Milk? and Wrigley's Doublemint Gum commercials. Barbados-born Rihanna has been big-brothered by music industry legends like Jay-Z and Kanye West and is signed to the Def Jam Recordings label. She has been astonishingly successful in the short time she has been on the music scene, attaining five Billboard Hot 100 No. 1's with ""SOS,"" ""Umbrella,"" ""Take a Bow,"" ""Disturbia"" and T.I.'s ""Live Your Life."" Like Rihanna, I had a bright future in my early 20s. I met my abusive lover at 22. I'd just graduated from Harvard and had a job at Seventeen Magazine in New York. My husband worked on Wall Street and was an Ivy League graduate as well. In our world, we were the last couple you'd imagine enmeshed in domestic violence. Many of my ex-husband's attacks also took place in our car. For reasons I never understood, the enclosed, soundproof space brought out his worst violence. He punched me so fiercely that my face had bruises from his fist on one side and from hitting the window on the other. As trapped in the car as I was in our marriage, it was there that I endured tirades about how controlling I was with money, how flirtatious and naïve I was with other men, how defiant and disrespectful I was of my husband's authority. So, I suppose I have more understanding than most about the shame, fury, confusion and disappointment Rihanna may be experiencing. What's hardest for outsiders to fathom is how lethal a cocktail love, hope and sympathy can be. I first fell for my husband the night he confided how he, like Chris Brown, had been traumatized as a young boy by domestic violence in his home. ""He used to hit my mom ... He made me terrified all the time, terrified like I had to pee on myself,"" Brown said during a 2007 interview with Giant magazine. Brown hasn't explained what happened in the recent incident, but this week he released a statement saying that he's sorry and saddened by it. Our culture encourages women to nurture men, making it predictable that many experience a seductive empathy for abusive men, as well as the misguided hope that love can obliterate an ugly past. In my case, it took four years, myriad terrifying attacks, and the intervention of the police and family court before I understood how little I could help my ex get over his abusive childhood. I certainly felt alone during my abusive relationship, but unfortunately I was in good company. The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that between 1 million and 3 million women in America are physically abused by their husband or boyfriend each year. Every day, on average, three women are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends. At some point in our lives, 25 percent of American women will report being physically abused or raped by intimate partners, according to the National Violence Against Women Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, these statistics, grim as they are, fail to highlight the root of the abuse cycle. A national survey showed that 50 percent of men who frequently assault their wives also frequently abuse their children. Witnessing abuse, as Chris Brown and my ex-husband did as young boys, is a form of abuse itself. Tragically, many victims of childhood abuse grow up to be abusers themselves. I always sensed that my husband didn't want to be hurting me -- he knew exactly how excruciating love and fear felt mixed together -- but his childhood rage overpowered his adult sensibilities. A few months after I left my marriage, I happened across another couple in another car, late at night on an empty street. I slowed down as a well-dressed woman about 25 years old was walking away from a white Honda, brushing off a tall, handsome young man wearing a sports coat and jeans. Suddenly she turned and tried to run. He grabbed her with his long arms and shoved her up against a dirty storefront. Even from my car I could see the fear on her pretty face. Without thinking, I jerked my car over and got out. By this time the man had let the woman go and she'd slid behind the wheel of the car. He stepped back as I approached, his anger displaced by uncertainty and shame at being interrupted. I didn't look at him. I leaned into the car as she sat clutching the wheel, crying and staring straight ahead. ""I just left a husband who beat me for three years,"" I said. ""You do not have to put up with this. You do not deserve to be treated like this."" ""I know,"" she whispered as fresh tears poured down her face. She sniffed loudly and shook her head. She wouldn't look at me. Her eyes were rimmed red, but I could see resolve in them. ""You're right,"" she said. ""It's just taking me longer than I thought."" As I left, I gave the man a long stare. The spell had been broken and his face was open, sorrowful, filled with hope and fear -- a look I had seen dozens of times on my husband's face. How long would that look last before he got angry again? I could feel the woman's determination as I got back into my car. I knew she would be all right, one day. The man, I was less certain about. Family violence is a criminal act; perpetrators, while often former victims themselves, need to accept culpability. Until we can prevent children from witnessing and becoming victims of abuse, the cycle will repeat itself: there will be many more Chris Browns and ""alleged victims"" in our headlines and in our homes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leslie Morgan Steiner.","Leslie Steiner: I was victim of domestic violence many years ago .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in South Dakota and Nebraska on Friday suspended a search for a missing Nebraska family after a relative told authorities he spoke to his kin and said they are doing well. The Schade family of Creighton, Nebraska, is not missing, a relative says. Law officers still don't exactly know the location of Matthew Schade of Creighton, Nebraska; his wife Rowena, and their two children -- a daughter, 11, and a son, 8. But authorities think they might be in Nebraska because officials received a tip that a brush truck they suspect the couple stole from a volunteer fire department in South Dakota has been found abandoned in Antelope County, Nebraska. A brush truck is a type of small fire truck. The family was last seen on March 20 in Knox County, where Creighton is located. Knox Sheriff James Janecek said the family had gone missing after an officer went to their house on a domestic abuse complaint. Matthew Schade had been on probation for burglary and is wanted for violation of probation and failure to report a change of address, Antelope County Attorney Michael Long told CNN. Schade's father, Chet Schade, contacted the Knox sheriff's office on Thursday afternoon. He confirmed he had spoken with all four family members and said they were alive and well. The Knox County sheriff's office is urging the couple ""to contact authorities immediately to resolve the situation."" ""They could only help themselves by giving us a call,"" Janecek said. Searchers had been searching for the family in South Dakota's Black Hills until it was determined the couple possibly made their way back to Nebraska. ""The investigation clearly shows the Schade family is no longer in the Black Hills area,"" said the sheriff's office in Pennington County, South Dakota. Investigators think the Schades might have gone camping on U.S. Forest Service property in the Black Hills. Schade had visited the area in the past, and law officers found the family's Ford Taurus on Tuesday in Silver City, South Dakota. CNN's Kara Devlin and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Law officials says they still don't know location of family .

"(CNN) -- After his inauguration, if President Barack Obama needs real-time intelligence on crises around the world, he is likely to do it in the Situation Room, the ultra-secure conference room in the White House. It's a place this new president may be seeing a lot of. Interconnected crises: Afghan children hold toy guns in an anti-Israel protest. During the election campaign, Obama often talked about Iraq, a war he opposed, and his plan to withdraw troops within 16 months. He stressed the need to increase U.S. forces in Afghanistan. He criticized Russia for moving its troops into Georgia. Ultimately, however, the campaign hinged on the economy. Substantive debate over the long list of international challenges facing the United States never happened. As soon as he lowers his hand after taking the oath of office, this new president is responsible for steering the United States through the stormy waters of foreign policy dangers. He must decide not only which issues to take on, but when to take them on. But, in this interconnected world, the U.S. president cannot dictate the timing of world events. Crises can hit at any time. An effective president must be ready to act quickly while, at the same time, keeping his long-term focus on strategic priorities. And everywhere he looks, a raft of questions need answering. So, where does Obama start? Israel-Palestinians . The conflict between Israel and the Palestinians conflict flared up again with deadly results just as Obama prepares to take office. The Bush administration's last ditch efforts at forging a final status agreement between Israel and Palestine is in tatters. Will the new president continue the Bush policy of close alliance with Israel? Or will he talk tough to his Israelis allies, urging them to refrain from air attacks and to stop building new settlements while, at the same time, pressing the Palestinians to stop their rocket attacks on Israel and crack down on terrorism? Should he pull out all the stops, trying for a high-stakes strategy of brokering peace and a two-state solution? Or should he just try to put out the immediate fire? Iraq . President Obama takes office as the new Strategic Framework Agreement between the U.S. and Iraq, along with the Security Agreement governing the presence of U.S. forces in the country, goes into effect. U.S. forces will now operate under new rules with the Iraqi military officially taking the lead. U.S. forces are scheduled to be withdrawn by the end of 2011. But will Iraqi soldiers and police be up to the task of guaranteeing security for Iraqi citizens? By December 31, 2011 will Iraq really be stable enough for U.S. troops to leave? Afghanistan . Obama wants Afghanistan, not Iraq, to be the central front in the battle against terrorism. With attacks by the Taliban and other extremist groups on the rise, Afghanistan is sinking into chaos. Obama calls the situation ""urgent"" and wants to send more troops. Commanders in Afghanistan are asking for up to 30,000 additional troops, joining the 36,000 already there. But, beyond the number of soldiers, what is Obama's strategy to win the war in Afghanistan? Can he convince NATO allies to contribute more troops when they refused similar requests from President Bush? Can he ""regionalize"" his approach to the war, involving countries like Iran in the solution? How will he carry out his plan to target al Qaeda? Can U.S. forces finally capture Osama bin Laden? Iran . Iran's political power in the region is growing. Tehran is moving forward with efforts to enrich uranium and, some fear, ultimately produce enough for a nuclear bomb. In one of the most controversial issues of the U.S. presidential campaign Obama said he was willing to talk with the United States' enemies. Will he follow through with Iran? What if Israel carries out a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities before the talking is over? Pakistan . Pakistan's border regions have become havens for terrorists including, experts believe, Osama bin Laden. The Bush administration focused its relationship with nuclear-armed Pakistan on the military under General Pervez Musharraf, an uneasy alliance dictated by the war on terrorism. But concentrating on the military meant ignoring Pakistan's civilian government. How will Barack Obama balance the need to work with the military and security forces of Pakistan without undermining Pakistan's already-weakened democracy which, in turn, leads to more instability? Russia . In the wake of war in Georgia, U.S.-Russian relations are in their worst state since the end of the Cold War and the potential for serious conflict between Washington and Moscow is growing. Russia experts are urging Obama to review the relationship from top to bottom, establishing with Moscow new ""rules of the game"" that would avoid the current cycle of U.S. lecturing and Russia blustering. Will Obama follow their advice and work with Russia as an equal on challenges like Iran and nuclear non-proliferation? Financial meltdown . The world-wide financial crisis is not just an economic issue; it can limit the ability of the new president to project U.S. power internationally. Potentially it could destabilize countries. Many other nations, including America's friends, blame the origins of the crisis on the U.S., and Obama will need as many friends as he can get -- plus a coordinated world response -- to end this meltdown. A World Transformed . One of the biggest challenges facing the new U.S. president is not a country, or an international leader, it's the world itself in which power -- economic and political -- is shifting. New players are emerging: Brazil, Russia, India, and China, the so-called ""BRIC"" countries. Non-traditional issues like climate change are playing an increasing role in the United States' foreign policy. So is competition for energy supplies. From his seat in the White House Situation Room, President Obama will see a world filled with threats -- and opportunities. By establishing his priorities early, he can be ready for both.","Israel-Palestinians flared up again during the presidential transition period .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- When singer-pianist Peter Cincotti showed up to speak to CNN in 2004, he was fresh-faced and impeccably dressed in a suit and shiny shoes. Peter Cincotti rose to fame as a jazz pianist. His new album features pop songs. Seated at a piano, and under the watchful eye of his very sweet mother Cynthia, Cincotti performed the standard ""How High the Moon,"" showing off piano skills you'd expect from someone far beyond his 21 years. His debut album had just topped the Billboard traditional jazz chart -- the youngest artist to claim such a feat. Now 25, Cincotti is still fresh-faced, but he sings to a very different tune. Looking trendy in a fitted sweater, his hair a little looser, his personality more playful -- mom didn't come to this interview -- Peter has gone pop. ""He's this great jazz pianist,"" says producer David Foster, who worked on Cincotti's new album. ""And he just turned the whole thing 180 and wrote these incredible pop songs."" To Cincotti, whose pop debut ""East of Angel Town"" was released last week on Warner Bros. Records, the switch isn't that big a deal. ""I'm a musician,"" he says. ""I was just playing what I love then, and I'm playing what I love now.""  Watch Cincotti do what he loves » . Enlisting Foster to help navigate the transition was crafty: Foster is a 15-time Grammy winner with an undeniable knack for generating pop hits. He also has a reputation for getting his way in the studio. But Cincotti, a native New Yorker, didn't make things easy. ""He's a control freak, too, so we butted heads a lot,"" says Foster. ""And he actually made me come to New York to make the record. And I don't like New York because I'm claustrophobic and I don't dig elevators. But he made me come here for three months. That's how much I loved his music."" Cincotti smiles when he recalls the expletive-ridden voicemail message Foster left him expressing his displeasure over having to vacate his Los Angeles base to work on the project. ""I saved that message,"" Cincotti says. ""It's great."" Cincotti talked to CNN about new beginnings, old influences and playing piano in the fast lane. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: What do you love about pop? Peter Cincotti: To be honest I don't even categorize (my music) as that. It's just what I'm doing now. This is my first record that I've written everything. It's my first record of original material so the style changed and that's basically what I'm doing right now. CNN: When a 25-year-old is writing songs, what experiences are you drawing on? Cincotti: Well, this record is ... kind of like a debut, and I wanted to write about things that I never sang about before in songs. Things that either happened to me, personal experiences. And I didn't want to write a record of ""I love you and you love me."" So a lot of the subject matter I think is a bit atypical of what's out there right now ... at least to me. CNN: You've been playing the piano since you were how old? Cincotti: I started when I was 3. My grandma bought me this ten-key toy piano, and she taught me how to play ""Happy Birthday."" It was my third birthday, and I sat down and I never stopped. CNN: Which pianists have inspired you over the years? Cincotti: There are so many. I'm still going through phases. I'll just listen to a certain musician. The first guy I remember ... I got my first cassette ... it was a Jerry Lee Lewis tape. I remember I was 5 years old and I went with my uncle to the record store. And I always liked ""Great Balls of Fire"" ... and I just couldn't stop trying to play like Jerry Lee Lewis. So he was the first piano player guy that really got under my skin. And then that led to many others ... piano players like Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Billy Joel. From Art Tatum to Shirley Horne ... CNN: Jerry Lee Lewis played fast. Do you like to play fast? Cincotti: Back then I did. Back then I was fascinated. The faster the better. Now, if it's called for, sure. CNN: What was it like working with David Foster? Cincotti: It was great. He was a pain in the ass! In a good way. And I was a pain in the ass back to him. But I love working with him. There was no BS. It was just a very honest relationship. And I went through a period of taking my time figuring out what kind of producer I wanted for this record, and when he and I met ... we said ""let's just do one song together and see if it works out."" I was honored that he was interested, but at the same time I wanted the record to be right for what the vision was. But we got together and did 11 songs in three days. And it was one of those things that just clicked and happened. I couldn't imagine doing it with anyone else. CNN: What do you have against Los Angeles? Cincotti: I don't know if I have anything against it, but I'd rather spend my time elsewhere. CNN: Like New York? Cincotti: Like New York. CNN: You're a New Yorker through and through aren't you?

""My immediate reaction was anger: How dare anyone take a photograph of my home without my consent? I ran outside to flag the car down and told the driver he was not only invading our privacy but also facilitating crime. ""This is an affluent area.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has blocked the imminent release of dozens of sex offenders who have served their federal sentences after the Obama administration claimed many of them remain ""sexually dangerous."" The Supreme Court has blocked the release of sex offenders  after claims they remain dangerous. Chief Justice John Roberts on Friday ordered that the men be kept in custody while the case works its way through a federal appeals court, which had ruled as many as 77 North Carolina inmates should be released, some as early as next week. At issue is whether the government has the power to indefinitely detain prisoners who have served their sentences but could pose a public threat upon release. Such laws are known as ""civil commitments."" The Justice Department filed papers with the high court Friday, asking that any release be put on hold until the justices have more time to consider the larger legal issues raised in their appeal. Such an early release ""would pose a significant risk to the public and constitute a significant harm to the interest of the United States,"" wrote Solicitor General Elena Kagan, who took office this month. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act passed by Congress in 2006 included a provision allowing indefinite confinement of sex offenders. A federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, ruled lawmakers had overstepped their authority, prompting the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court. The law was named after the son of ""America's Most Wanted"" host John Walsh. The boy was kidnapped and murdered by a suspected child molester in 1981. Four inmates brought suit against the law. They were serving sentences of up to eight years for sexual abuse of a minor or possessing child pornography. Their detention was to have ended two years ago, but corrections officials and prosecutors determined they remained a risk for further sexually deviant behavior if freed. The inmates argued such continued imprisonment violates their constitutional right of due process. The justices' actions means the men remain behind bars for now. The case is U.S. v. Comstock (08A863).","As many as 77 North Carolina inmates are scheduled to be released .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- NATO-led troops killed 12 insurgents in a firefight Friday in Afghanistan, and a civilian caught in the crossfire was apparently killed by militants, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. U.S. Marines fire 120mm mortars on Taliban positions on April 3 in Now Zad in Helmand province, Afghanistan. The incident occurred south of Kabul in the eastern Afghan province of Logar, when Afghan security forces and ISAF troops were conducting an operation. It comes as NATO members meet in Europe to discuss the fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and as human rights groups this week urged NATO and the U.S. military to avoid civilian casualties and develop a well-coordinated condolence payment system for civilians victimized in the war. Troops saw a large group of insurgents placing a roadside bomb. The militants retreated to a compound and attacked ISAF troops with small arms. Troops surrounded the compound and urged them to surrender peacefully after it was cordoned off. It also asked the people in the compound to release women and children but no civilians left. Troops assaulted the compound and 12 male insurgents were killed in gunfire. Troops found one woman who was killed in the crossfire by insurgent small arms fire, ISAF said. An investigation is being conducted by Afghan National Security Forces at the site. Initial indications show that the woman was killed by insurgent small arms fire. Eight AK47 rifles, two rocket propelled grenade launchers, several rocket canisters, 82mm mortars, and two heavy machine guns were found in the compound. ""ANSF and ISAF are making significant progress against insurgent groups in Logar province who are involved in murdering civilians with IEDs,"" said Brig. Gen. Richard Blanchette, ISAF spokesman. ""Today's firefight illustrates the difference between ISAF troops who risk their lives to protect civilians, and insurgents who deliberately and tragically place civilians at risk."" Also, ISAF reported the death of a soldier from the NATO-led force Friday in eastern Afghanistan. The soldier died of wounds and another was injured after what was described as a ""hostile incident."" ""On behalf of the men and women of the International Security Assistance Force, I offer our heartfelt condolences to the loved ones of the brave soldier killed, and our support to the soldier wounded in this incident,"" Blanchette said. ""As we recognize their sacrifice in our battle against a vicious insurgency, we will continue supporting the Afghan National Security Forces so that the Afghan people reap the tangible benefits of peace in their day-to-day lives."" Overnight in the southern Afghan province of Helmand, troops killed four militants in an operation targeting a mid-level Taliban commander responsible for attacks against Afghan civilians and coalition forces. The commander directed attacks in December in Musa Qala, including one that killed 12 Afghan civilians.","Afghan forces investigating death of woman caught in crossfire of gunbattle .

"(CNN) -- Following this week's tough talks on the global financial crisis, President Obama on Friday shifted his tone to reflect upon his regrets, his frustrations and his hopes for the younger generation. ""There's nothing more noble than public service,"" President Obama says. Obama's remarks came after a woman from Heidelberg, Germany, asked if he ever regretted having run for president. The question yielded a lengthy response from Obama, who is participating in his first overseas trip in office. ""That's a good question,"" Obama said at a packed town hall meeting in Strasbourg, France. ""Michelle definitely asked that question. ""You know, there have been times, certainly during the campaign, and there have been times over the last several months where you feel a lot of weight on your shoulders. There's no doubt about it,"" the president said. With his wife, Michelle, looking on, Obama continued, ""During the campaign, the biggest sacrifice -- the thing that was most difficult was that I was away from my family all the time.""  Watch Obama weigh in on his regrets and sacrifices » . The president joked that he was jealous of not only Europe's high-speed rail but also the fact that campaigns there only last a few months. Obama announced that he was running for president on February 10, 2007, and was inaugurated nearly two years later. ""So I was away from home all the time, and that was very difficult, because not only do I have a wonderful wife, but I have two perfect daughters, and so, you know, I missed them a lot,"" he said. The president expressed disappointment about the lack of privacy and anonymity he's experienced since assuming office. ""You know, it's very frustrating now,"" he said. ""It used to be when I came to Europe that I could just wander down to a cafe and sit and have some wine and watch people go by and go into a little shop and watch the sun go down. ""Now I'm in hotel rooms all the time. And I have security around me all the time. So just losing that ability to just take a walk, you know? That is something that is frustrating.""  Take a look at Obama's European itinerary » . After a couple of minutes of going over his regrets, Obama paused. ""But -- having said all that, I truly believe that there's nothing more noble than public service,"" he said, adding that service doesn't mean one has to run for president. Obama pointed to Doctors Without Borders, the United Nations and community work as examples of other ways to serve. ""But the point is that what I found at a very young age was that if you can only think about yourself -- 'How much money can I make? What can I buy? How nice is my house? What kind of fancy car do I have?' -- that over the long term, I think you get bored,"" he told the audience of mostly students. ""I think if you're only thinking about yourself, your life becomes diminished, and the way to live a full life is to think about what can I do for others, how can I be a part of this larger project of making a better world,"" he said. Obama said with all the challenges facing the world now, the younger generation has an abundance of opportunities to make a difference. ""It would be a tragedy if all of you who are so talented and energetic -- if you let that go to waste, if you just stood back and watched the world pass you by,"" he said. ""Better to jump in, get involved -- and it does mean that sometimes you'll get criticized and sometimes you'll fail and sometimes you'll be disappointed -- but you'll have a great adventure. And at the end of your life, hopefully you'll be able to look back and say, 'I made a difference.' ""","President Obama says being away from family biggest sacrifice of campaign .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Farrah Fawcett has been hospitalized in the latest stage of her battle against cancer, a producer working with the actress said Monday. Farrah Fawcett, shown here in 2004, was first diagnosed with cancer in 2006. ""She is not unconscious, she is not unresponsive, and she is not comatose,"" Craig Nevius told CNN. He added that Fawcett ""is surrounded by family and friends."" She ""has a real iron will"" and is ""a fighter,"" he said. Nevius has been working with the 62-year-old on a documentary about her fight with cancer. Earlier, he told People magazine that Fawcett had checked into ""a Los Angeles hospital."" Fawcett was diagnosed in 2006. People magazine reported that she has anal cancer. Early in 2007, Fawcett said she was told her cancer had gone into remission. Her official Web site has posts from February, 2007 celebrating the news. But the cancer returned later that year. Fawcett was a model best known for bit parts and commercials, and as ""Six Million Dollar Man"" actor Lee Majors' wife, when she shot a best-selling pinup poster in early 1976 at the behest of a Cleveland, Ohio, company called Pro Arts. Photographer Bruce McBroom placed Fawcett -- then known as Farrah Fawcett-Majors -- in the Indian blanket-draped front seat of his 1937 Chevy and snapped away. The poster, with Fawcett's million-dollar smile front and center and right nipple obvious through the fabric of her red bathing suit, became a sensation. Soon after the photo shoot, Fawcett was asked to join the cast of a new Aaron Spelling TV show, ""Charlie's Angels,"" about a trio of female detectives who work for a mysterious man named Charlie. Fawcett, who played Jill Munroe, was the last to be cast -- co-star Kate Jackson was the known name at the time -- but, thanks to her poster, Fawcett became the series' breakout star. The highly rated TV series kicked off what came to be known as ""jiggle TV,"" series full of young actresses who appeared in bikinis at the drop of a hat. ""Denunciations of 'massage parlor television' and 'voyeurism' only brought more viewers to the screen, to see what the controversy was about,"" wrote Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh in their exhaustive reference, ""The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows."" ""Charlie's Angels"" turned out to be a huge hit, and shows ranging from the sitcom ""Three's Company"" to the drama ""Baywatch"" owe the show a debt. Fawcett didn't stay with ""Angels"" long. At the end of the first season, unhappy with her contract, she left the show, replaced by Cheryl Ladd. Fawcett's career stagnated for a time after ""Charlie's Angels,"" as she appeared in a handful of forgettable films and divorced Majors. But her career received a major boost with her starring role in ""The Burning Bed,"" a 1984 made-for-television movie co-starring Paul LeMat. In the film, Fawcett played an abused wife who sets fire to her husband's bed as he lies sleeping. Fawcett received an Emmy nomination for her performance. Around that time, Fawcett became romantically involved with actor Ryan O'Neal, with whom she had a son, Redmond, in 1985. Redmond O'Neal was arrested Sunday morning for narcotics possession. In recent years, Fawcett has appeared sporadically in the public eye. She posed nude for Playboy in 1995. In 1997, she appeared on ""The Late Show with David Letterman,"" an interview that became notorious for Fawcett's apparent incoherence. She later said she was just having fun with Letterman. She reunited with her ""Charlie's Angels"" co-stars, Jackson and Jaclyn Smith, for an awards-show appearance in 2006. Fawcett has been making a documentary, ""A Wing and a Prayer,"" for NBC about her cancer battle. ""She is an icon, and you don't become an icon by being weak,"" Nevius said Monday. ""All you have to do is look back at her 30-year-plus career to see that she is not somebody that has ever stepped down or backed down from a challenge of any kind.

"(CNN) -- Malawi's decision to reject pop star Madonna's adoption of a local child has reignited global debate about the ethics of international adoption. Author Melissa Fay Greene poses with her family, which includes biological and adopted children. Some international aid groups have praised the decision as best for the child, a 4-year-old girl named Chifundo James. ""I think it really highlights the bigger picture that there are so many children living in poverty in Malawi, and while Madonna has good intentions ... children would be better off staying in their own communities whenever possible,"" said Karen Hansen-Kuhn, policy director for ActionAid USA, a development group that also works in Malawi. ""We really need to stay focused on the needs of Malawi and of all the children there,"" she added. To get another perspective on the situation, CNN also talked with Melissa Fay Greene, an author and mother of five adopted children. Greene, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, is the mother of four biological children, four children adopted from Ethiopia and one adopted child from Bulgaria. The following is an edited transcript of that conversation: . CNN: What's your initial reaction to the news that Madonna's adoption of a Malawian child has been rejected? Greene: Surprise. ... It was awfully tricky with Madonna's first adoption, when the child turned out to have devoted family members nearby. [The singer's adoption of a Malawian boy was finalized last year.] And if that's true with this child also, it seems a similar sticky situation. That's not the situation for the majority of orphanage children around the world, who don't have caring grandparents or aunts and uncles a short walk or bike ride away. I think it gives people an odd perspective on what international adoption can mean for children who don't have any support network outside the walls of an orphanage. You often hear attacks on international adoption as robbing a child of his or her culture, and that's both true and false. It's true that an internationally adopted child loses the rich background of history and religion and culture and language that the child was born into, but the cruel fact is that most children don't have access to the local, beautiful culture within an orphanage. ... There's a culture in orphanages that children are eager to escape from, and it's a culture of being reared as a group and not being doted upon by parents. For any child, that's the bottom line. The fact is that a human child wants that mommy or daddy or both. We're just wired to want that and to need that. And there's no way an institutional setting can give a human baby what the child needs. It's impossible. So you have to balance priorities. ... I think what some of the human rights group say is absolutely accurate: that international adoption does not begin to solve the problems of the world's orphaned children. It's truly not the answer. ... At the same time, international adoption, even though it doesn't solve the whole problem, it solves a problem for a few. I think it can be a brilliant solution to the problem of adults wanting a child in their lives or wanting more children in their lives and the problem of children who want parents in their lives. CNN: How is it different for a celebrity person seeking an [international] adoption than for yourself? Greene: We don't jet in, take a child and fly out with a child. For an average citizen trying to adopt, it takes most of a year. First of all, you work with a country that already has international adoption regulations in place, so you have a bureaucracy dealing with international adoption. A big part of that is determining that the child is a true orphan, that there is no one who can care for the child. And in the case of our older kids' adoptions, people had to come to court to testify that there was no one to take the children. So you don't run the risk of 'Oh, whoops, there's a grandmother down the street.' ... CNN: There's been some chatter today online questioning why a person wouldn't adopt an orphaned child from their own country. Greene: Within the adoption world, it's a non-issue. There are children all over the world who need families, and some find their children in Philadelphia, and some find their children in Bulgaria, you know? ... It's just outsiders who look on and judge disapprovingly, but then they don't go on to adopt the neighborhood children, right? ... There are many children who need help, and anyone who wants to reach out and adopt a child from foster care or from a Russian orphanage should reach out and do it. CNN: What has the experience been like for your own foster children? Greene: We're a white Jewish family in Atlanta, but Atlanta is a major city for eastern African immigrants. So our children are in touch with the Ethiopian diaspora, and they feel very much a part of that. Atlanta is full of Ethiopian restaurants, markets, festivals. For a while, my kids were playing on weekends with an Ethiopian soccer league. I have an Ethiopian baby sitter who speaks to them only in Amharic so they won't lose their language, and we always have Ethiopian food here. Two years ago, we went back to Ethiopia with the kids and had a big reunion for one of my sons and his extended family ... We just consider ourselves sort of part of this amazing bicontinental family. CNN: The first time you adopted internationally, can you tell me what your ethical considerations were and how you worked through that personally? Greene: Our first adoption was of a boy in rural Bulgaria. An incredibly poor orphanage. The kids were hungry, thirsty, no education. I first met our son, Jesse, when he was 4. He was 4 years old, and he did not know what his own name was ... When he first came, he was just so anxious about food. When he would wake up, he was just shaking, wondering if there was going to be enough food. So I started waking him up with food. He had issues with water. He wasn't sure if there was going to be enough water to drink, so I bought him a little canteen so he could wear his water all of the time. Do I have ethical issues about taking him out of that orphanage? I don't. CNN: Is there anything else you wanted to add? Greene: I admire Madonna. And I don't understand why everyone attacks Madonna. I think that she is in part trying to raise the world's consciousness about the African orphan crisis. You know, 95 percent of the children orphaned by AIDS [globally] are in sub-Saharan Africa. You don't hear world leaders talking about it. Where is the global outrage? ... So, into the breach steps a celebrity. But don't attack her for it, you know. Maybe her methods are not what ours would be, but how many of us are Madonna? But at least she is out there; she's creating a school. Obviously, she's fallen in love with the Malawian children to such an extent she wants to make some of them her own. And I think that it's great. I just don't understand why the world's attacking her. Let other people step forth and do something. At least she's trying. That's my feeling.","Malawian judge rejects Madonna's request to adopt a 4-year-old girl .

"(CNN) -- A large ice shelf is ""imminently"" close to breaking away from part of the Antarctic Peninsula, scientists said Friday. Scientists are investigating whether the ice breakup is caused by global climate change. Satellite images released by the European Space Agency on Friday show new cracks in the Wilkins Ice Shelf where it connects to Charcot Island, a piece of land considered part of the peninsula. The cracks are quickly expanding, the ESA said. Scientists are investigating the causes for the breakups and whether it is linked to global climate change. The Wilkins Ice Shelf -- a large mass of floating ice -- would still be connected to Latady Island, which is also part of the peninsula, and Alexander Island, which is not, said professor David Vaughan, a glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey. The ice shelf experienced a great amount of changes last year, the ESA said. In February 2008, the shelf dropped 164 square miles (425 square kilometers) of ice. In May it lost a 62-square-mile chunk. That meant the ""bridge"" of ice connecting Wilkins to the islands was just 984 yards wide at its narrowest location, the ESA said. Further rifts developed in October and November, said Angelika Humbert of the Institute of Geophysics at Germany's Muenster University. ""During the last year the ice shelf has lost about 1800 square kilometers (694 square miles), or about 14 percent of its size,"" Humbert said. Antarctica's ice sheet was formed over thousands of years by accumulated and compacted snow. Along the coast, the ice gradually floats on the sea, forming massive ledges known as ice shelves, the ESA says. Several of these ice shelves, including seven in the past 20 years, have retreated and disintegrated. The Wilkins Ice Shelf had been stable for most of the past century before it began retreating in the 1990s. ""It had been there almost unchanged since the first expeditions which mapped it back in the 1930s, so it had a very long period of real stability, and it's only in the last decade that it's started to retreat,"" Vaughan said. Wilkins is the size of the state of Connecticut, or about half the area of Scotland. It is the largest ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula yet to be threatened. If the ice shelf breaks away from the peninsula, it will not cause a rise in sea level because it is already floating, scientists say. Some plants and animals may have to adapt to the collapse. The Antarctic Peninsula is the piece of the continent that stretches toward South America.","A large Antarctic ice shelf is cracking and may break away .

"(CNN) -- Johanna Sigurdardottir was sworn in as Iceland's prime minister on Sunday, becoming the world's first openly gay premier and the first woman to take the post in Iceland. Johanna Sigurdardottir is a former flight attendant and union leader. Sigurdardottir, 66, took office less than a week after the Cabinet resigned amid fallout from Iceland's financial collapse. A former flight attendant who entered politics via the union movement, Sigurdardottir was minister of social affairs and social security in the outgoing Cabinet, which resigned Monday. Iceland has been in political turmoil since October, when its currency, stock market and leading banks collapsed amid the global financial crisis. The island nation's Nordic neighbors sent billions of dollars to prop up the economy, as did the International Monetary Fund in its first intervention to support a Western European democracy in decades. But weekly demonstrations -- some verging on riots -- finally forced Prime Minister Geir Haarde and his coalition to resign en masse on January 26. The country's president turned to the Social Democratic Alliance party to form a new government, and they selected Sigurdardottir to lead it. She has been a member of Iceland's Parliament for 30 years, and was in her second stint as minister of social affairs. She started her career as a flight attendant for the airline that became IcelandAir. She was active in the flight attendants' labor union during her 11 years with the airline, according to her official resume. She briefly led her own political party, which merged with other center-left parties to form the Alliance party. Sigurdardottir is Iceland's first female prime minister, although not the North Atlantic nation's first female head of state -- Vigdis Finnbogadottir became its fourth president in 1980. Sigurdardottir lists author and playwright Jonina Leosdottir, 54, as her spouse on her ministry Web site. She has two children from an earlier marriage. Her prime ministership may be short-lived. The government she is forming is only due to last until the next elections, which must take place by May and could be held in April. A statement posted by the new government on Iceland's Web site promised elections ""as soon as circumstances allow,"" and said the interim government ""will base itself on a very prudent and responsible policy in economic and fiscal matters."" The statement added that the government will treat as priorities ""the principles of sustainable development, women's rights, equality and justice."" Stonewall, a leading British gay and lesbian rights group, welcomed Sigurdardottir's appointment as a milestone. ""It really does matter. It is helpful"" to have an openly gay prime minister, said Gary Nunn, a Stonewall spokesperson. ""We are trying to foster the ambition that young people can be anything they want to be.""","NEW: Johanna Sigurdardottir sworn in Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Artillery shells slammed into a hospital Sunday in the northern Sri Lankan district of Mullaittivu, where civilians -- including a growing number of children -- are being treated as government forces and Tamil rebels continue to clash. A Sri Lankan soldier walks through Mullaittivu, the former military headquarters of the Tamil rebels. More than 200 civilians and at least 30 children have been injured in the last three days of fighting, a relief worker told CNN Sunday. ""That is the absolute minimum (number of injured),"" the aid worker, who did not want to be identified for fear of jeopardizing the work of relief organizations, said. Government officials are accusing aid organizations and foreign media of sensationalizing civilian casualties. ""It looks as if it's convenient for certain agencies to exaggerate the numbers so that this can be converted to a humanitarian crisis in the public eye, "" Secretary of Foreign Affairs Dr. Palitha Kohona told CNN. On Sunday, Sri Lankan Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa promised to ""continue with the military offensive until we liberate the remaining area under LTTE (the rebel group) control,"" according to Sri Lanka's state-run news agency.  Watch a report on civilians caught in fighting » . A ""handful"" of United Nations staff are working around the clock to save a growing number of children caught in the crossfire, a U.N. spokesman said Saturday. Children as young as 4 months old were being treated in local hospitals for shrapnel injuries and other ""wounds of war,"" spokesman James Elder told CNN. ""There is just intense fighting in a small area where children and other civilians are,"" Elder said. ""The space (where conflict is taking place) is shrinking and the fighting is augmenting."" Thursday, U.N. aid workers rescued 50 critically injured children and 105 adults, he said. ""We are trying to get as many people out of there as we can,"" Elder said. Humanitarian groups say as many as 250,000 unprotected civilians are trapped in the area. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa has promised to allow safe passage to trapped civilians and urged the Tamil Tigers to promise the same. ""We have declared a safe zone for civilians, the coordinates of which were announced by the security forces,"" Rajapaksa said on his government's Web site. ""It is unfortunate that the (Tamil Tiger group) is exploiting this declared safe zone for civilians by placing their heavy artillery within the safe zone and using it as a launching pad to attack security forces and indiscriminately kill civilians."" The fighting has created a ""nightmarish"" situation for civilians in the conflict zone, Elder said. An emerging shortage of humanitarian supplies and diminished access to clean water, sanitation, and food are compounding a crisis, he said. Sunday, Sri Lankan soldiers seized a key rebel stronghold in a surprise attack deep in Tamil held territory. Troops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency. The The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead.","Sri Lankan hospital hit by artillery shells .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- George Obama, the half brother of U.S. President Barack Obama, told CNN on Sunday that he was released from a Kenyan jail hours after his arrest on suspicion of marijuana possession. George Obama was arrested in Kenya on suspicion of marijuana possession, according to police. Kenyan police did not confirm whether George Obama was still in their custody. Obama spoke to CNN from his cell phone, and a relative also said he was released. He said he was arrested on Saturday and released later that day. Obama was arrested on suspicion of possession of cannabis, known in Kenya as bhang, and resisting arrest, Inspector Augustine Mutembei said. He was held at Huruma police post in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, and scheduled to appear in court Monday, Mutembei said. But Obama told CNN all charges against him were dropped. Police would not comment on that. Speaking from behind bars on Saturday, Obama denied the allegations. ""They took me from my home,"" he said. ""I don't know why they are charging me."" George Obama and the president barely know each other, though they have met. George Obama was one of the few people closely related to the president who did not attend the inauguration in Washington. In his memoir, ""Dreams from My Father,"" Barack Obama describes meeting George as a ""painful affair."" His trip to Kenya meant meeting family he had never known. CNN tracked down George Obama in August 2008 and found him at a small house in Huruma, a Nairobi slum, where he lives with his mother's extended family. His birth certificate shows he is Barack Obama's half brother. The two men share the same Kenyan father. In the memoir, Barack Obama struggles to reconcile with his father after he left him and his mother when he was a child. Barack Obama Sr. died in a car accident when George was 6 months old. And like his half brother, George hardly knew his father. George was his father's last child and had not been aware of his famous half brother until he rose to prominence in the Democratic primaries last year. Unlike his grandmother in Kogela, in western Kenya, George Obama received little attention from the media until reports about him surfaced in August 2008. The reports sprung from an Italian Vanity Fair article saying George Obama lived in a shack and was ""earning less than a dollar a day."" The reports left George Obama angry. ""I was brought up well. I live well even now,"" he said. ""The magazines, they have exaggerated everything. ""I think I kind of like it here. There are some challenges, but maybe it is just like where you come from, there are the same challenges,"" Obama said. Obama, who is in his mid-20s, said at the time that he was learning to become a mechanic and was active in youth groups in Huruma. He said he tries to help the community as much as he can.","George Obama says he's out of jail, that charges against him have been dropped .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Heidi Newfield goes into Sunday's Academy of Country Music Awards with five nominations. It's more than any other female, but she still considers herself the dark horse -- and in many ways, she is, especially since she's up for top female vocalist against such heavyweights as Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift. Heidi Newfield says she considers herself an underdog at Sunday's Academy of Country Music Awards. For 10 years, Newfield was the lead singer of the honky-tonk trio Trick Pony. Her soulful debut solo album, ""What Am I Waiting for,"" was released in August to stellar reviews -- many from critics who scoffed at the high-energy antics of her former band. If you spend any time with the petite blonde from Northern California, you're struck by how many times she says, ""Please"" and ""Thank you."" There's a smile for everyone -- waiters, doormen, cameramen -- and she steers conversation away from herself to ask how others are doing. Newfield is a nice girl. But her life changed when a fellow musician told her to stop being so nice, as she revealed in the following interview with CNN:  Watch Newfield talk about her nominations » . CNN: What went through your head when you received five nominations for this year's Academy of Country Music Awards? Heidi Newfield: I thought one or two would be so fabulous, that would be so great. And they kept calling my name, and you know, I won't lie -- I'm going to tell on my husband -- the tears started flowing, and we were just really happy. All the hard work, all the time, and all the road -- and just the experience over time starts to play back in your mind, just like a movie.This is a really special time. CNN: Was it validation that leaving Trick Pony was the right thing to do? Newfield: People tell you, ""You can't do this."" You know in country music oftentimes it does not work when a front person leaves a group. In other genres -- pop, rock, hip-hop and rap -- people can leave all the time and do amazing things on their own. Beyonce, Justin Timberlake, Sting -- there's a gazillion people. But in country, we have that tight-knit, almost family relationship with our fans, so when you change something up, they don't always like that very much. CNN: Did you feel guilty about leaving Trick Pony? Newfield: No, not an ounce of guilt. I left Trick Pony with my head held high. I felt like I left with total dignity and class, and I didn't leave anybody hanging. I fulfilled every obligation, no matter how hard it was -- and it was hard. There was a lot of drama, and they weren't exactly happy with me. I don't mind saying this, but it was miserable the last several months. But my intuition was saying it's time to make a change. So did I stay too long? I don't know. I mean, everything happens for a reason. Had I left three years ago, maybe I wouldn't have been the same person I am today. CNN: John Popper from Blues Traveler kind of gave you a kick in the pants. Newfield: Oh, I love Poppy! We talk all the time, I kid you not. John was on a USO tour with us for 2½ weeks, so we got to know each other really well. Every night, he would come on stage and do a [harmonica] number with me. On the last night of the tour, we were in Germany, and we were at this pub, and Poppy said to me, ""You love this, and it's clear you're a musician -- but you need to learn to stop being so nice. You need to speak your mind and step up and step up for yourself."" His actual words were, ""When you learn to be a b----,"" that's what he told me. And I thought, ""Well, my philosophy is I don't think you ever, ever, ever have to be a diva or a prima donna to make it to a certain level."" I think you can always treat people with respect and be nice, and I always plan on doing that. But what he said was right. When you start to believe in yourself, that's when there's no limit to what you can do. CNN: Your debut solo album, ""What Am I Waiting for,"" shows a lot of growth. It's much more introspective and mature, whereas Trick Pony's music was brash and not as multidimensional. Newfield: When my producer Tony Brown and I first sat down to talk about making this album, one of the first things that came out of his mouth was, ""We have to show people who you really are. We need to cut songs, and you need to explore parts of your vocals that you never got a change to showcase."" All the ACM nominations are validation that we are on the path to doing just that and being taken seriously as an artist -- as a singer, as a songwriter and as a musician. We made a record that made people say, ""Hey, this girl can sing."" And that's what I had always hoped. CNN: Still, it's a building process, and in a lot of ways, you're starting from scratch. Newfield: At this one fair that I went to, they had my name spelled H-e-d-y instead of H-e-i-d-i. Hedy Newfield. And I thought, ""Oh, that's just great."" And, of course, you go up to the promoter and say, ""Come on, hook a sister up here."" So we're fixing that. CNN: Of the five awards you're up for at the ACMs, you have to be most thrilled about top female vocalist. [Newfield is up against Underwood, Swift, Lee Ann Womack and Miranda Lambert.) Newfield: I'm the biggest dark horse ever. I'm the big underdog, but I like to be the underdog. I hope the makeup's rockin'. I hope I look good at that moment when they call out, ""Carrie Underwood.""","Heidi Newfield is up for five Academy of Country Music Awards .

"(CNN)  -- Parts of the Texas town of Wheeler were evacuated Saturday as strong, shifting winds fanned wildfires that had already destroyed three buildings, law enforcement officials said. Wildfires in the Texas panhandle are being fed by sustained winds of about 40 mph. Two homes and one business had been burned down by a fire that had grown to engulf about 8,000 acres by Saturday night, said Lewis Kearney, a spokesman for Texas emergency services. Another 12 homes had been damaged, and 300 homes and 60 business were threatened, according to a report from state emergency officials. The heavy winds -- sustained at about 40 mph with gusts up to 60 mph -- were making it hard for helicopters and other firefighting vehicles to battle the blaze, Kearney said. Further complicating matters were three other smaller fires, about 100 acres each, elsewhere in the state that had already stretched emergency resources. There were no immediate reports of injuries in the Wheeler fire. About 200 residents of the town of about 1,400 people on the eastern edge of the Texas panhandle were evacuated Saturday, state officials reported. The fire was believed to have started at about 4 p.m. ET Saturday, according to the state report.","NEW: Wind-driven fire had grown to 8,000 acres Saturday night .

Protesters carrying Tibetan flags chanted ""China Murderers,"" and ""China Out of Tibet,"" as Wen, on a three day trip to Britain, arrived at the embassy. China has long been criticized by the international community for its human rights record in Tibet. Tibetans are pushing for autonomy from China and greater religious freedom. Wen was greeted at the embassy by a firecracker display in honor of the Chinese New Year before being escorted inside by security personnel. A group of protesters attempted to jump over security blockades when Wen's motorcade arrived at the embassy. Several were wrestled to the ground by police and arrested. Police said five people were detained, according to the UK's Press Association. Approximately 150 Chinese counter-protesters were also at the demonstration chanting pro-Chinese slogans.

"(CNN) -- A judge ordered Tuesday that the man accused of killing singer and actress Jennifer Hudson's mother, brother and nephew be moved from a state prison to the Cook County jail to make it easier for his lawyer to meet with him. Jennifer Hudson, at the October premiere of ""The Secret Life of Bees,"" hasn't performed in public since the killings. William Balfour, 27, has been held at Stateville Correctional Center near Joliet, Illinois, since he was arrested in early December in what defense lawyer Joshua Kutnick called ""a difficult position."" ""[Balfour] has exhibited, to me, patience,"" Kutnick told CNN after Tuesday's hearing. ""He understands that this case is not going to be over this week or next week or next month,"" Kutnick said. ""He realizes in order for us to establish that he's not guilty, that we're going to have to go through all the steps of fighting the case.""  Kutnick said the defense is conducting its own investigation of the killings and has subpoenaed the prosecution's evidence. Nothing has been handed over yet, he said. He would not speculate on when the case might go to trial. ""You're talking about some time down the road,"" Kutnick said. Balfour, indicted a month ago, entered a not guilty plea last week. Tuesday was the first time Balfour has been before Judge Marjorie Laws, who was appointed last week after prosecutors asked that Judge Evelyn Clay be removed from the case. Prosecutors did not make public their reasons for wanting a new judge. While Judge Laws ordered Balfour to be moved to Chicago, Kutnick said he expects it might just be for 10 days. ""The sheriff of Cook County does not always obey those orders because he is dealing with his own problems such as jail overcrowding,"" Kutnick said. ""He's doing OK"" despite ""being incarcerated under a difficult position,"" Kutnick said of Balfour. ""When any inmate is serving a sentence on a parole violation, they're kept in what's called the receiving unit,"" Kutnick said. ""It's very restrictive. They don't get the kind of free time and privileges that general population gets, so that is very difficult for him."" Hudson has not performed in public since the deaths, but she is scheduled to sing the national anthem Sunday at the Super Bowl. Balfour first was detained for questioning October 24, the day that Hudson's mother and brother were found shot to death. At the time, authorities said they were holding Balfour for an unspecified parole violation. Prosecutors have portrayed Balfour as a jealous man who killed three people in a rage at the thought that his estranged wife had a boyfriend. Balfour is the estranged husband of Hudson's sister, Julia Hudson, and stepfather of one of the victims, 7-year-old Julian King. He also has been charged with one count of home invasion. Balfour denies the charges, and his attorney told the court in December there was no forensic evidence linking him to the killings . Hudson won a best supporting actress Oscar for her portrayal of Effie in the 2006 film version of the Broadway musical ""Dreamgirls."" She competed on the third season of the TV singing competition ""American Idol"" and was among the top seven contestants before her elimination.","William Balfour has been at Illinois' Stateville Correctional Center since December .

"(CNN) -- An immigration judge with the U.S. Justice Department has granted a stay to John Demjanjuk, the Nazi war crimes suspect who had been ordered deported to Germany, his lawyer said Friday. John Demjanjuk appears in court in Jerusalem in 1987 on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. John Broadley said the stay was ordered after Judge Wayne Iskra in Arlington, Virginia, decided to reopen deportation proceedings. ""In the four years since his deportation was ordered, his health has seriously deteriorated,"" Broadley told CNN in a telephone interview. Broadley had argued that Sunday's plan to send Demjanjuk to Germany, which has issued an arrest warrant for him, and putting him through the rigors of a trial there would be tantamount to torture. Demjanjuk -- a Ukrainian -- is accused of involvement during World War II in killings at a Nazi German death camp in Poland. He denies the allegations. The retired auto worker celebrated his 89th birthday Friday with his wife at their home in Cleveland. Broadley said Demjanjuk suffers from pre-leukemia, kidney problems, spinal problems and ""a couple of types of gout."" German authorities issued the warrant for Demjanjuk on March 10, accusing him of being an accessory to 29,000 counts of murder as a guard at the Sobibor death camp from March to September 1943. Demjanjuk says he fought in the Soviet army and later was a prisoner of war held by the Germans. Demjanjuk has been fighting charges of Nazi war crimes for well over two decades. He was extradited from the United States to Israel, where he was convicted in 1986 of being ""Ivan the Terrible,"" a guard at the notorious Treblinka extermination camp. The conviction was overturned by Israeli courts on appeal and he returned to the United States. The United States filed new charges against him in 1999, again alleging that he had been a concentration camp guard. A federal judge found in 2002 that Demjanjuk had been a guard at the Sobibor death camp, where a quarter of a million people were killed during World War II, and at two other concentration camps. Prosecutors argued that Demjanjuk concealed his history when he came to the United States in 1952. He was stripped of U.S. citizenship and has been awaiting deportation since 2005, despite fighting his case all the way to the Supreme Court. CNN's Diana Magnay contributed to this report.","NEW: Judge reopens deportation hearings on accused former death camp guard .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- For the first time since media coverage was banned in 1991, the return of the body of a fallen member of the U.S. armed forces was opened to news outlets late Sunday. A transport plane carries caskets of U.S. servicemen in this photo the Pentagon released in 2005. The U.S. Air Force informed media on Sunday that the family of Staff Sgt.

He died Saturday in a roadside bombing in southern Afghanistan, the U.S. military reported. In February, President Obama and Defense Secretary Robert Gates overturned a policy that dated back to the first Persian Gulf war. They agreed to allow reporters to observe the remains of American troops being returned to the U.S. military mortuary at Dover, as long as families agreed.

"(CNN) -- A Connecticut woman attacked Monday by her friend's pet chimpanzee was taken Thursday from a Connecticut hospital to the famed Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, a hospital spokeswoman said. She would not divulge the victim's condition nor the reason for the move. Travis, seen here as a younger chimp, was fatally shot by police after attacking Nash, authorities say. Charla Nash, 55, was transferred by airplane and ambulance to the clinic, where doctors in December performed the first facial transplant in the United States. The attack has raised questions about whether exotic animals should be kept as pets. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said Wednesday that primates and crocodiles should be added to a state list of animals citizens are not allowed to own. Nash initially was taken to Stamford Hospital, where she underwent seven hours of surgery after she was attacked by the 14-year-old chimp, named Travis. Nash's friend, Sandra Herold, 70, had called Nash for help in getting the animal back inside her house after he used a key to escape. When Nash arrived at Herold's Stamford home, the chimp, who has been featured in TV commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy, jumped on her and began biting and mauling her, police said. Doctors said Wednesday that Nash had received extensive injuries to her face and hands. A Stamford police officer fatally shot the nearly 200-pound chimp after the primate turned on him inside a police cruiser, police said. Herold told reporters at her home that she and the chimp slept together and that she considered him like a son.","Charla Nash, 55, transferred from Connecticut by airplane .

"(CNN) -- The blog ""Stuff White People Like"" is wildly popular with fans who've embraced the hilarious, satirical sendup of the white middle class that -- according to the list -- have an ongoing love affair with things such as coffee (No. 1), organic food (No. 6), yoga (15) and the Toyota Prius (60). Blogger-turned-author Christian Lander is the force behind ""Stuff White People Like."" The site also has spurred an outpouring from those who view it as offensive and racist. Now devotees and detractors alike have more to discuss with the release of the book ""Stuff White People Like: A Definitive Guide to the Unique Taste of Millions"" by the blog's creator, Christian Lander. Filled with photos and some content from the blog, the guide includes new entries exclusive to the book. Lander also worked with a designer to create things such as flow charts on ""How to Name a White Child"" and ""White Career Trajectories"" as well as a test of the reader's ""whiteness."" As befitting the genius behind such a site and book, Lander is a bit of a ham (actually, make that Canadian bacon since he hails from Toronto, Ontario).  Watch Lander talk about what he likes » . The origins of ""Stuff"" date from January 2008, he said, because of an instant messenger conversation between him and his friend Miles about the HBO drama ""The Wire."" Miles, who is Filipino, tossed off that he didn't trust any white person who didn't watch the series. That exchange started a back-and-forth between the two about what white people were doing instead of watching the show. ""We said, 'Oh, they are going to plays, they're doing yoga, they're getting divorced,' "" recalled Lander, who couldn't pass up the gold mine of ideas and started blogging. ""The goal was to literally make Miles and a few of my friends laugh, and it just took off."" Within six weeks, Random House came calling, and a book deal was finalized. CNN talked to the blogger-turned-author about his ""whiteness,"" whether he is like Stephen Colbert but instead mocks earnest, left-wing types, and why ""Stuff White People Like"" will never make the list of ""Stuff White People Like."" CNN: Where do you get your ideas? Christian Lander: Farmers' markets. CNN: How do you get your ideas at farmers' markets? Lander: Keeping my eyes open. I just see what people are up to. And the mirror is another good place to look for inspiration. I really make fun of myself. CNN: So what makes you an authority on white people? Lander: Look at me [laughing]. I mean, I have liberal arts degrees; I look like this. I'm on the inside. CNN: Do you ever worry about offending people? Lander: No. I'm glad when I offend people with this because it's not offensive. What's been great about it is the title draws people in, and right away they are like, ""What is this? Am I going to get offended by this?"" Then they read it, and it's not what they expect. People see the title and they expect ""Stuff White People Like"" to be entries like mayonnaise, or dancing poorly, these old stereotypes that are really outdated and aren't even funny anymore. You're sort of expecting it to be the lame white guy stuff and you go, ""Oh my God, this is all the stuff I actually like."" It's playing off white stereotypes, but it's not stereotypes in a demeaning way. CNN: If those are old stereotypes, could your stuff be considered ""new stereotypes""? Lander: No, because they're true [laughing]. I consider these valid observations. It's an update on this idea of a yuppie. In the '80s, the idea of the yuppie was really about just consumerism: I have an expensive BMW, I have these things, and it's buying, buying, buying. I think that that attitude is still there, but the materials changed into where it's ""My carbon footprint's lower, my music taste is better, I visited more countries than you."" The quest for status is still there. CNN: What are some of the entries that elicited the most negative responses and really pushed people's buttons? Lander: One was written by Miles. Now Miles is Asian, and I can't stress that enough. He wrote post No. 11, which is ""White People Like Asian Girls."" That has been by far the most commented on. The other ones have all been pretty level in terms of drawing responses from people. CNN: What are some of the things that have been rejected from the list? Lander: People send in stuff all the time, and one of the things is that people just don't get what I am going for here. They send in [suggestions such as] guns, NASCAR, trailer parks -- these old stereotypes that are not what I'm after. The one I reject a lot is people say, ""Well, you know what, 'Stuff White People Like' should be on the list of 'Stuff White People Like.' "" I'm just like, ""All right, postmodern hero, you're not the first person to send this in. I'm not putting it on the list."" CNN: Entry No. 92 is book deals, so we are assuming you like that one. What are some other things on the list you like? Lander: There are things that I like that I am ashamed that I like. My favorite entry, which I wrote and where I attack myself the most, is ""Knowing What's Best for Poor People."" That was one that definitely applies to me, and I sort of recognize the ego that's behind that one and how ridiculous that one is. CNN: What's some stuff white people don't like? Lander: Other white people. That's it. The wrong kind of white people. CNN: Who are the wrong kind of white people? Lander: Anyone you blame for everything that's wrong in America are the wrong kind of white people. Not only do they hate them because they create all of these problems, but if those kinds of people start liking anything on this list, they immediately become unacceptable. CNN: Stephen Colbert made the list, and he's renowned for making fun of the right wing. Do you consider yourself a type of Stephen Colbert for the lefties? Lander: I don't know because Stephen Colbert, in his heart of hearts, is a lefty and so am I. I consider myself a self-aware, left-wing person who's not afraid to recognize the selfishness and contradictions that come on the left. I think a lot of people who are on that side really fail to do that a lot of the time. I think the people I write about here are very, very self-righteous and believe that everything they do is right, and they are very resistant to cast a critical eye to themselves. It was really fun for me to write in a cathartic way, sort of like I am attacking my own pretentiousness and my own ridiculousness. It's just amazing because these people are so self-aware but so unaware at the same time.","Popular ""Stuff White People Like"" blog now a book .

"(CNN) -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that despite President Bush's low approval ratings, people will soon ""start to thank this president for what he's done."" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says ""there is no greater honor than to serve this country,"" ""So we can sit here and talk about the long record, but what I would say to you is that this president has faced tougher circumstances than perhaps at any time since the end of World War II, and he has delivered policies that are going to stand the test of time,"" Rice said in an interview that aired on CBS' ""Sunday Morning."" The secretary of state brushed off reports that suggest the United States' image is suffering abroad.  She praised the administration's ability to change the conversation in the Middle East. ""This isn't a popularity contest. I'm sorry, it isn't. What the administration is responsible to do is to make good choices about Americans' interests and values in the long run -- not for today's headlines, but for history's judgment,"" she said. ""And I am quite certain that when the final chapters are written and it's clear that Saddam Hussein's Iraq is gone in favor of an Iraq that is favorable to the future of the Middle East; when the history is written of a U.S.-China relationship that is better than it's ever been; an India relationship that is deeper and better than it's ever been; a relationship with Brazil and other countries of the left of Latin America, better than it's ever been ... ""When one looks at what we've been able to do in terms of changing the conversation in the Middle East about democracy and values, this administration will be judged well, and I'll wait for history's judgment and not today's headlines."" Asked by CBS' Rita Braver why some former diplomats say Americans are disliked around the world, Rice said that's ""just not true."" ""I know what U.S. policy has achieved. And so I don't know what diplomats you're talking to, but look at the record,"" she said. Rice said she wasn't bothered by criticism about her or the administration's polices, saying if a person in her business is not being criticized, ""you're not doing something right."" ""I'm here to make tough choices, and this president is here to make tough choices, and we have. And yes, I -- there are some things that I would do very differently if I had it to do over again. You don't have that luxury. You have to make the choices and take the positions that you do at the time,"" she said. Asked about historians who say Bush is one of the worst presidents, Rice said those ""aren't very good historians."" ""If you're making historical judgments before an administration is already out -- even out of office, and if you're trying to make historical judgments when the nature of the Middle East is still to be determined, and when one cannot yet judge the effects of decisions that this President has taken on what the Middle East will become -- I mean, for goodness' sakes, good historians are still writing books about George Washington. Good historians are certainly still writing books about Harry Truman,"" she said. Rice, 54, said she has enjoyed working in the Bush administration during the last eight years, first as national security adviser, then as secretary of state. ""There is no greater honor than to serve this country,"" she said, adding that there is also no greater challenge. Rice said when the new administration takes over, she plans to return to the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and write two books -- one on foreign policy and one about her parents.","Condoleezza Rice says Bush's policies will ""stand the test of time""

"(CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for tighter controls over tourism and other forms of pollution in Antarctica Monday, arguing for greater global cooperation to help preserve the continent's environmental and scientific research value. The Dry Valley region of Antarctica has seen an increase in visits by tourists. Addressing a joint session of the Arctic Council and the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in Baltimore, Maryland, Clinton said the Obama administration is concerned about the growing popularity of tourism in the southern polar region. She said the United States is proposing new international limits on the number of landings from tourist vessels, as well as greater cooperation to prevent potentially hazardous discharges from those ships. At the same time, the United States is proposing new requirements for lifeboats on tourist ships ""to make sure they can keep passengers alive until rescue comes,"" Clinton noted. Aside from worrying about the environmental impact of tourism, the U.S. is ""concerned about the safety of the tourists and the suitability of the ships that make the journey south,"" she said.  Watch Clinton say how the Antarctic has been protected from war » . The issue of tourism in the Antarctic has become an increasingly divisive issue in recent years, pitting scientists and preservationists against a travel industry seeking to capitalize on a growing demand for adventure and nature-oriented tours. Over 46,000 tourists visited Antarctica in the 2007-2008 tour season -- almost four times as many visitors as during the 2000-2001 season, according to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators. Clinton's remarks came as the United States helped mark the 50th anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty, a model for ""how agreements created for one age can serve the world in another,"" Clinton said. Clinton noted that President Obama sent the U.S. Senate an amendment to the treaty Friday that would spell out how the international community should better prevent and respond to environmental emergencies in Antarctica. The amendment would cover the question of liability tied to environmental damage in the ecologically sensitive region. In addition, the United States has proposed an extension of the treaty's marine pollution rules ""in a manner that more accurately reflects the boundaries of the Antarctic ecosystem,"" she noted. ""The treaty is a blueprint for the kind of international cooperation that will be needed more and more to address the challenges of the 21st century,"" Clinton said. ""It is an example of smart power at its best: governments coming together around a common interest and citizens, scientists and institutions from different countries joined in scientific collaboration to advance peace and understanding."" Clinton argued that the treaty ""and its related instruments remain a key tool in our efforts to address an urgent threat of this time: climate change."" A number of international scientific research stations have been established in Antarctica in part to help explore the probable causes and effects of global warming. Twelve nations initially signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959; 47 nations abide by it today. The accord specifies that Antarctic territory cannot be used for military purposes. It bans, among other things, nuclear testing and the disposal of radioactive waste material on the continent. It also protects freedom for international scientific research in the region.","Secretary of State Hillary Clinton calls for limits on tourism in Antarctica .

"Editor's note: Clarence B. Jones, author of ""What Would Martin Say?"" is Scholar in Residence at the Stanford University Martin Luther King Jr. Research & Education Institute. He was a lawyer and speechwriter for Dr. King. Clarence Jones says America is indebted to Martin Luther King Jr. for breaking its addiction to segregation. Next week, the day after our national holiday commemorating the 80th birthday of Dr. King, Barack Obama will be sworn in as the 44th president of the United States, the first African-American elected as president. Obama's election would not have been possible without the transformative effect of Dr. King's struggle, leadership and legacy in dismantling segregation and institutional racism in the United States. America owes a great debt to Dr. King. Prior to him, our nation was like a dysfunctional drug addict or alcoholic, hooked and addicted to segregation and institutional racism. His ""tough love"" of nonviolent direct action civil disobedience forced America to confront its conscience and the immorality of racial injustice. Dr. King enabled our country to embark on an extraordinary journey of recovery to reclaim its soul. He enabled us to reactivate those precepts enshrined in our Declaration of Independence: ""all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights."" In twelve years and four months, from 1956 to April 4, 1968 -- except for President Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation -- Martin Luther King Jr. may have done more to achieve racial, social and political justice and equality in America than any other person in our country's history. Dr. King had confidence in the democratic future of America. He believed that we, as a people, would be able to ""transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood."" I met Martin Luther King, Jr. for the first time 49 years ago when he visited my home in California to enlist my assistance in the defense of a criminal tax indictment against him by the state of Alabama. Only six months earlier, I had graduated from Boston University Law School. I worked for him as a law clerk, political organizer, personal lawyer and, at his request, I drafted speeches for Dr. King until his death on April 4, 1968. He was an ordained Christian minister before he was a civil rights leader. His religious faith and abiding belief in God were the fuel that ignited the engine of his moral leadership. President-elect Obama's religion and belief in God appear central to his political leadership. During the 40 years following Dr, King's assassination in Memphis, Tennessee, the most recurring question asked of me has been: ""Who today, what  black leader, if anyone, is most like Dr. King?"" I would consistently answer that Dr. King was sui generis, one of a kind And, then ask rhetorically: ""Who today is most like Michelangelo, Mozart, Galileo, Copernicus, Aristotle, Beethoven or Shakespeare?"" Since Obama's election, I have been asked: . • Is Barack Obama another Martin Luther King Jr? • What would Dr. King say about the election of Obama? • Does the election of Obama, as the first African-American president of the United States, mean that Dr. King's dream has been fulfilled? • Does Obama's election indicate that racism for all practical purposes no longer exists in America? • Will Obama's election have any impact on the number of African-American men incarcerated or the high percentage of out-of-wedlock births within the African-American community? There are no easy answers to these questions, but it is clear that those of us in the civil rights movement of the 1960s never anticipated the event we will witness Tuesday. After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the assumption of the presidency by former Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, some of us who worked closely with Dr. King, concluded no fundamental change in race relations in America could be accomplished successfully and sustained unless it was done under the political leadership of a white man from the south, people like Presidents Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Our belief was predicated on the political assumption that America would be more willing to follow a white southern political leader on the issues of race relations and equal economic opportunity than a politician from another part of our country. We never contemplated the realistic possibility of a black president of the United States in our lifetimes. The 1965 Voting Rights Act sparked the prairie fires of subsequent black voter registration and voting which dramatically altered the political landscape of America. It was this legislative foundation that fostered and facilitated the political possibility of a successful Obama candidacy for president. ""We Shall Overcome"" was our national anthem of the Civil Rights Movement under Dr. King's leadership. President-elect Obama, like a masterful musical composer with perfect pitch, successfully updated, translated and rearranged ""We Shall Overcome"" to a ""Yes, We Can"" surround-sound mantra for the cell phone, YouTube, Facebook, MySpace and Internet-blackberry generation. This may be the most enduring 21st Century tribute to the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Clarence Jones.","Clarence Jones: Martin Luther King cured U.S. of addiction to racial segregation .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Deep into injury time in one of Manchester United's most important games of the English Premier League season a 17-year-old Italian on debut hit a stunning winner and lifted himself to instant stardom. Man of the moment: Seventeen-year-old Federico Macheda is now a legend at Manchester United . Federico Macheda was the teenager who came on as a substitute and scored late on Sunday for the Red Devils -- helping them to a 3-2 win after they had earlier trailed 2-1 to Aston Villa at Old Trafford. The finish was of the highest quality -- as he curled the ball past Villa goal-keeper Brad Freidel from a wide angle. His fine touch, turn and shot were made all the more amazing given their significance in the context of both the match and season. But, who is this 17-year-old hero? And how did he get to live his fairytale? Born in Rome in 1991 (yes, 1991), Macheda, known by team-mates as ""Kiko"", is a striker who developed his game through the ranks of the Lazio youth programme in Italy -- where he is considered as one of the brightest talents of the future. He made a move to Manchester United in September 2007, and quickly moved up the ranks -- starting out in the under-18 side, before progressing to the senior reserve team. He officially signed a professional contract with the club on his 17th birthday, in August 2008. Although Sunday's goal puts his name permanently on the minds of all Manchester United faithful, it's not the first time he has made an impression. Just six days before he scored a thrilling hat-trick for the reserve team in a 3-3 draw against Newcastle at St James' Park. He has also represented Italy at under 19 level. What did you think of Macheda's goal? Can he go on to become a top club and international player? Share your thoughts in the Sound Off box below. Macheda was eventually booked for celebrating with the crowd after his strike -- though he later revealed he had hugged family members -- who were in the crowd to see his debut. He was named man of the match for his goal (after playing just 30 minutes) and although he wasn't allowed the bottle of wine he won for the honor -- he told Manchester United television ""this is the best day of my life."" In the post-match interview on Sky Sports, Macheda said: ""I think this is the day of my dreams -- to score a goal like that on my debut."" The Manchester United Supporters' Web site has since been inundated with comments praising Macheda, and there are even several proposed supporters' chants being drafted for their new star. English-based Italian football journalist Gabriele Marcotti told CNN he had been impressed by Macheda's progress at a young age -- but felt it was important he didn't get ahead of himself. ""When a guy scores like that on debut there's always excitement. But, he needs to keep his feet on the ground and keep working,"" Marcotti said. Marcotti said the reaction from Italian fans was likely to be mixed. While there would be happiness that he is emerging as a great prospect for Italy in future, there is also concern that players like Macheda are moving to England at a young age and the Italian clubs who train them gain very little in compensation, he said.","Federico Macheda scores stoppage time winner for Manchester United .

Kryssia, Abraham's mother, is from El Salvador. ""I loved the name Abraham,"" she says. ""I always did. I think it sounds so elegant and in Spanish, it's 'Aab-ra-haam'. In the Bible, Abraham is the 'father of our faith.' "" ""I never knew I was going to marry a man with the last name 'Lincoln,' never dreamed about it. So when I got married (in 1982) to my husband, Dean Lincoln, and we had our second child, and it was a boy,"" she says, snapping her fingers, ""sure enough, I wanted to name him Abraham. ""We didn't have to argue very much because of course the heritage that he has ... and his great-grandfather's name was Abraham.""  See photos of the Lincolns » . At the Lincolns' home in Everett, Washington, the dining room table is full of genealogy lists, old family photos and letters, some dating back to the Civil War. Dean carefully unfolds one of the letters. It's from William Lincoln, a Union soldier and Dean's great-great-great-grandfather. ""The 'Rebs' are getting just where ol' Sherman wants them,"" William Lincoln wrote home to his wife. ""He will rout them soon and drive them back to their holes."" ""We ain't heard from the election to any certainty yet. But the soldiers think, if Lincoln is elected, we have hopes of the war playing out."" Of his famous name, Abraham says, ""At first, people don't believe me. I usually have to pull out my driver's license. They'll usually crack a few jokes ... sort of breaks the ice."" ""Once in school, a teacher came to my name in roll call. He decided to stop the class and told me to 'make sure I never drive a Ford car.' 'Don't ever let my wife convince me to go to a theater.' ""He asked if I knew John Wilkes Booth. Those are the most common ones. I think he was waiting to get a reaction outta me, but I told him that I'd heard them before."" Word spread quickly through his high school that this freshman wanted to be called ""Mr. Prez."" The nickname stuck. And because of his Hispanic roots, some of his classmates even called him ""El Presidente."" ""I think I've heard every one in the book. I still get a chuckle every time someone thinks they've come up with a new one,"" Abraham says. Abraham grew up in Everett, where, coincidentally, the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln is based. When he was 16, the local newspaper asked if he would write a letter to crew members returning from a mission to Iraq. Abraham's letter read, in part: . ""Dear Lincoln crew, . ""My name is Abraham Lincoln. I want to thank you for making me proud to know that the men and women on board the Abraham Lincoln, a ship with the same name as me, are out there fighting as true American heroes."" At first, Abraham had no desire to walk in the shadow of such a great leader. Then, at the University of Washington, he took a political science class. ""There was something about politics that drew me,"" he says. ""I loved the history behind it. That's when I made up my own mind: That was the path I wanted to go."" Abraham spent a semester in Washington, D.C., as an intern for former Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts. On his list of places to visit? The Lincoln Memorial and Ford's Theatre. ""The whole atmosphere of that city, knowing someone I was related to, a descendant of mine, had such a huge impact and changed the world as we know it ... And to have a huge memorial dedicated to such a great president."" This past summer, Abraham married Jenae, whom he met as a church youth leader. He says she likes the history behind the name and the attention they receive. Abe is working as a paralegal. He wants to attend law school and -- you guessed it -- pursue a career in public service or politics. ""If anything, President Abraham Lincoln is a great model to follow after. So if you have the name, might as well go down the same path."" Of the similarities between Presidents Lincoln and Obama, Abraham says, ""Lincoln came into office with a nation divided in the Civil War, and Obama is the first African-American president, hoping to transcend party lines dividing America."" Since Abraham's birthday comes eight days after his famous namesake's, the Lincoln family will celebrate President Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday together with their own son's birthday. Meanwhile, Dean is growing a beard again. Kryssia wants him to shave the mustache and don a suit to honor President Lincoln's birthday . She says of her son: ""No, I don't think he looks like Abraham Lincoln, the president. But he has the name and he serves well the name ... And I think there's a future for my son. ""I just know in my heart he will keep honoring that name. It's very special.""","Abraham Lincoln of Washington state is a 23-year-old paralegal .

"Editor's note: Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. His new book, ""Arsenal of Democracy: The Politics of National Security -- From World War II to the War on Terrorism,"" will be published this fall by Basic Books. Zelizer writes widely on current events. Julian E. Zelizer says so far the Obama presidency resembles that of Lyndon B. Johnson. PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- While pundits have compared President Obama to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, less attention has been paid to another, perhaps more apt parallel -- Lyndon Baines Johnson. Sometimes the similarities are striking. Both aimed high, seeking major legislation to reshape America -- Johnson with civil rights and Medicare, Obama with health care and energy legislation. Both Johnson and Obama understood that Congress was a credit-claiming institution whose members did not like to have proposals rammed down their throats. Johnson's style of political leadership was famous. A creature of the Senate, Johnson loved to lean on legislators and intimidate them into supporting his agenda. As Senate majority leader from 1955 to 1961, Johnson had been famous for subjecting colleagues to the ""Treatment"" whereby the hulking Texan cornered a legislator in the hallway, stood eye to eye and made his arguments about a bill until he received assurances of support for particular legislation. Although Johnson slightly changed his posture once he was president, he still relied on this kind of interaction to build support. As president from November 1963 until January 1969, Johnson worked closely with the Southern committee chairmen and ranking Republicans who dominated the House and Senate. Johnson sought to achieve a delicate mix of maintaining control over deliberations -- thinking of ways to obtain what he wanted without giving the appearance of it being a presidential-led idea -- all while responding to the concerns of the chairmen. The back-and-forth deliberations with House Ways and Means Chairman Wilbur Mills over the creation of Medicare in 1965 have become the classic example of how a president can work the chamber while allowing a congressional leader into the room to shape a bill in ways with which he'll be comfortable. Johnson agreed to redesign the particulars of the legislation so that the final program would protect the fiscal integrity of Social Security (under which it was included) and contain long-run costs. Thus far, Obama has taken a similar approach with the economic stimulus and, more recently, with his budget proposal. The president outlined to Congress the basic ideas he wanted in the final product but then left to lawmakers the work of designing the details. While the downside has been that Obama relinquished control over the structure of the legislation, House and Senate Democrats have felt invested and empowered to produce what Obama's team viewed as successful results. The second similarity is that Johnson, like Obama, distanced himself from the arguments of liberals who said that conservatives did not need to be feared. Johnson was consumed by his fears of a right-wing resurgence, even after trouncing Republican Barry Goldwater in the 1964 election. Johnson constantly warned advisers that the most dangerous political force in the country as far as he was concerned was not the left on college campuses but what he called the ""reactionary element"" within the GOP, and he took this into consideration when shaping legislative proposals. With domestic policy, Johnson avoided programs that could be tagged as ""socialistic,"" and on foreign policy he worked hard to demonstrate a tough stance against communism. Recently released telephone conversations have revealed that Johnson was obsessed with the 1966 midterm elections after the 1964 election was over, realizing that historically those results were not likely to be good for the White House. Obama has been reluctant to embrace liberal arguments about an end to the Age of Reagan, courting conservative journalists such as David Brooks instead of liberal pundits such as Paul Krugman. He accepted compromises on legislation in response to moderates in both parties and agreed to a financial bailout that pleased Wall Street, not Main Street. And his administration has steered clear of explicitly nationalizing banks, a step that could be called socialist. Obama has even touched on sensitive subjects such as deficit reduction and Social Security reform, which are much more appealing to the right than left. During one important conversation, Obama told the centrist Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana that he need not worry about his administration going too far on spending since he identified himself as a New Democrat, a reference to members of the party who in the Clinton years believed that they needed to accept some of the arguments of the conservative movement. Finally, both presidents understood the strategic importance of leveraging social movements to their political advantage. During the height of the struggles over civil rights, Johnson frequently pointed to the growing power of the grass-roots civil rights movement as he tried to pressure undecided legislators to support legislation to end public segregation and then to ensure voting rights for African-Americans. Johnson made it clear that the movement had become a potent force in American life, winning the hearts and minds of citizens, and that it could cause political trouble for his opponents. Obama has shown glimmers of a similar strategy with regard to the budget. The administration recently announced that it was trying to mobilize the ""net roots"" operation from the 2008 campaign to build pressure on wavering representatives and senators to support his plans on health care and the environment. The comparisons between Johnson and Obama likewise offer reminders about what could go wrong for the current president. After all, Johnson was a politician who looked like a transformative president in 1965 but within three years found himself to be a defeated man who withdrew from the Democratic primaries. Johnson's fears of the right, moreover, pushed him and America deeper into the deadly war in Vietnam. The social movements that LBJ used to his benefit in 1964 and 1965 turned against him as the administration plunged deeper into Vietnam, a lesson worth thinking about for the current administration. Johnson's policy of respect for committee chairmen prompted him to make compromises over social policy -- such as cuts in social spending in 1968 -- that weakened his support among the very Democrats he needed to win re-election. Johnson was never fully aware of how his greatest political skills could also become the source of his downfall. Obama's challenge is to harness the best parts of this comparison -- such as how Johnson handled Congress to produce dramatic legislative results -- without repeating the destructive characteristics that shattered Johnson's White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E. Zelizer.","Julian E. Zelizer: The Obama presidency resembles that of Lyndon B. Johnson .

"(CNN) -- Robert Pires is confident Villarreal -- nickname 'the Yellow Submarine' -- can torpedo the Champions League dreams of former club Arsenal in Tuesday's quarterfinal first leg clash in Spain. Robert Pires made his final apearance for Arsenal in the 2006 Champions League final defeat against Barcelona. ""We can beat them, for sure,"" said the former French internationa\. ""We would not come on the pitch if we were not convinced that we are good enough to go through. ""I would say that I expect a spectacular game between two teams that look like each other a lot. Hopefully we will see many goals."" The 35-year-old spent six successful seasons at Highbury, and made his last appearance for the Gunners in the 2006 Champions League final when he was substituted in an early tactical change following the sending off of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann. Such an exit was not the way Pires wanted to bring the curtain down on an Arsenal career which had seen him help guide Arsene Wenger's side through an unbeaten Premier League campaign in 2003/2004. ""I have always had a tremendous relationship with the Arsenal fans and these games will be the occasion for me to say goodbye to them,"" Pires told www.setanta.com. ""Not having been able to say goodbye to them is a pain to me. ""I wanted to have the chance to thank the Highbury public for their support, but I could not do it because my last game was the Champions League final with Barcelona. ""Then I announced my departure to Villarreal three days later and did not see them again. Sincerely, this draw is emotional to me, and fills me with nostalgia as well, that is for sure."" Pires was sent off in the 3-0 weekend defeat at Almeria that saw  midfielder Santi Cazorla break an ankle in a match that left Manuel Pellegrini's team in fourth place. Spain international midfielder Marcos Senna is, though, expected to be fit to face the Gunners. Arsenal striker Robin van Persie misses the trip to Spain with a groin injury, but Samir Nasri and Theo Walcott have been passed fit for the clash at El Madrigal after a virus and knee injury respectively.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- North Korea has positioned what is thought to be a long-range missile on its launch pad, a U.S. counter-proliferation official said on Wednesday. A North Korean soldier stands guard in the border village of Panmunjom on December 1, 2004 in South Korea. The official confirmed a Japanese media report. North Korea recently informed a pair of U.N. agencies that it plans to launch a satellite. The launch is slated for sometime between April 4-8, according to Yonhap, South Korea's state-sponsored news agency. North Korea is technically capable of launching a rocket in as little as two to four days, according to Kim Taewoo, an expert at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, but who doubts a launch will come that soon. It would not make sense for Pyongyang to make such a move after going through official channels with its plans, Kim said. ""The North could delay the launch if they experience problems with the weather, or within the leadership, but I don't see any reason why they would fire it ahead of time,"" Kim said. North Korea's announcement has triggered international consternation. U.S. and South Korean officials have long said the North is actually preparing to test-fire a long-range missile under the guise of a satellite launch.  Watch what might motivate Pyongyang to pursue missile tests » . Japan said this month that it could shoot down the satellite that North Korean officials said they plan to launch. What the North Koreans would be testing may not be known until an actual launch. A U.N. Security Council resolution in 2006 banned North Korea from conducting ballistic missile activity. Japanese officials said they could shoot down the object whether it is a missile or a satellite. ""As the U.N. resolutions prohibit (North Korea) from engaging in ballistic missile activities, we still consider it to be a violation of a technical aspect, even if (the North) claims it is a satellite. We will discuss the matter with related countries based on this view,"" Japanese Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone said this month. The United States has no plans to shoot down the North Korean rocket, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday, but will raise the issue with the U.N. Security Council if Pyongyang carries out a launch. ""We are doing our best to dissuade the North Koreans from going forward, because it is provocative action,"" Clinton said. ""It raises questions about their compliance with the Security Council Resolution 1718. And if they persist and go forward, we will take it up in appropriate channels."" South Korea echoed Clinton's statements. ""The South Korean government believes that if the North conducts its launch despite continuous warnings of the South Korean government and the international community, it is a provocative action that constitutes a serious threat to the security of northeast Asia and the Korean peninsula,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Moon Tae-Young. ""The launching of the long-range rocket is a clear violation of the U.N. Security Council Resolution No. 1718, and we strongly urge North Korea to immediately stop such measures."" The North Korean Taepodong-2 missile is thought to have an intended range of about 4,200 miles (6,700 kilometers) that -- if true -- could strike Alaska or Hawaii.","NEW: U.S. Secretary of State Clinton says U.S. has no plans to shoot rocket down .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Regular programming has just been interrupted by a news conference. A slender black man in a suit steps up to a podium, flanked by American flags and a White House logo. Michael Lamar was laid off in January but has a new job as a Barack Obama look-alike. ""I wish I could announce such an economic package,"" he says, ""but there is a bank in Turkey that did it. It is Garanti. I wish we had Garanti in America."" Don't be fooled. This is a commercial on Turkish TV. The actor is a 44-year-old Barack Obama look-alike from Whitehall, Pennsylvania, named Michael Lamar. And he is shilling for a Turkish bank. In the month before the real Barack Obama is to visit Turkey, this ad campaign went out all across the country on television and on billboards, using the iconic, Warholian image of the American president to sell low-interest loans. The ""Mad Men"" behind the concept say their Obama look-alike was the perfect guy to sell what they described as Garanti Bank's own economic stimulus package. ""We probably wouldn't be doing this commercial if it was the previous president,"" said Can Celikbilek, a copy writer at the advertising company, Alametifarika. ""But in the case of Obama, he does represent hope, not only for the States but for the whole world."" For Obama look-alike actor Lamar, there was some irony about getting flown to Turkey to star in a commercial for a bank. He is a recent casualty of the global economic crisis. ""I was laid off in January of this year from JP Morgan Chase Bank in the U.S.,"" Lamar said, in a telephone interview from Pennsylvania. ""After 18 years in the company, I was just laid off. One of the cutbacks. I'm currently unemployed right now."" Or, was unemployed. Lamar's striking resemblance to the American president has suddenly offered the former software analyst a possible new career for supporting his wife and child. ""I'm available full-time now,"" Lamar said. ""I'm going to see where this leads me."" Lamar is now being represented by a casting agency in Los Angeles that specializes in celebrity look-alikes. Since he discovered his new ""talent,"" he has traveled to the Netherlands to appear in a commercial for a liquor chain and to Paris, where an activist organization brought him in to meet lawmakers at the National Assembly, as part of a campaign to raise awareness about racism and racial profiling in France. ""This was very exciting for me, a true privilege!"" Lamar said. During his brief visit to Turkey, locals did double-takes when they saw Lamar walk past. ""Even in the studio, the crew [members] were like, 'Oh! Is that Obama?"" said Celikbilek of Alametifarika advertising. Using the image of an American president to promote anything in Turkey is a remarkable reversal. U.S. approval ratings in Turkey plunged to 9 percent, according to a 2007 Pew Research poll, making America less popular in Turkey then almost anywhere else in the world, even though the two countries are NATO allies. There was widespread anger among Turks at the war in neighboring Iraq. But the election of Barack Obama appears to have dramatically improved perceptions of America. ""Bush was a dictator who attacked other countries,"" said Abdurrahman Ozdemir, who sells cigarettes from a small stall on the street. ""But we love Obama ... because he does not want to go to war with other countries."" ""We started to love and like America because of Obama,"" said a 33-year-old woman named Begum Arinc. ""I don't want to see people dying. I don't want to see any war. That's why I want to believe in Obama.""","Michael Lamar strikes an Obama-like figure in ads for a bank in Turkey .

"(CNN) -- Norwegian Tony Andre Hansen has been stripped of his Olympic showjumping bronze medal -- and banned for our-and-a-half months by the International Equestrian Federation -- after his horse tested positive for a banned substance at the Beijing Games. Hansen was Norway's highest-scoring rider as the nation finished third in the Olympic team showjumping. The 29-year-old Hansen was the best performer in a four-rider Norway team which won bronze under a scoring system where the top three count. Without his scores, his teammates -- Morten Djupvik, Stein Endresen, and Geir Gulliksen -- drop out of medal contention. The fourth-placed Switzerland team of Steve Guerdat, Christina Liebherr, Niklaus Schurtenberger and Pius Schwizer will now be awarded the bronze medals by the International Olympic Committee. The United States won gold, beating Canada in a jumpoff in Hong Kong, where the equestrian events were staged last August. Hansen's horse, Camiro, tested positive for capsaicin, a banned pain relieving medication. He was provisionally suspended and did not complete the individual jumping competition. However, he is free to return to competition on January 3 as his suspension was backdated. ""It is each person's duty to ensure that no prohibited substance is present in his or her horse's body during an event,"" said the FEI. Although the drug can be used out-of-competition as a legal medication, it is also classed as a doping substance if used to inflame a horse's legs. This is done to encourage horses to jump higher because striking an obstacle becomes more painful. Hansen is the fourth rider disqualified and suspended in cases involving capsaicin: Germany's Christian Ahlmann was suspended for four months, Brazil's Bernardo Alves for three-and-a-half months, and Irish rider Denis Lynch got a three-month ban.","Norwegian Tony Andre Hansen is stripped of his Olympic showjumping gold .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill that would make suing for pay discrimination easier by altering a time limit on such suits. The act is named for Lilly Ledbetter, seen here in 2008. Her discrimination lawsuit victory was overturned in 2007. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which passed 250-177, would give workers alleging unequal pay the right to sue within 180 days of their most recent paycheck. Current law says such employees must sue within 180 days of receiving their first unfair paycheck. Supporters of the new legislation say that, under the current law, an employer merely needs to hide unfair pay practices for three months before being able to continue them without penalty. The act, named for a former Goodyear Tire employee who sued the company for gender discrimination in 1998, would effectively overturn a 2007 Supreme Court decision on the limit. Ledbetter was awarded $360,000 in back pay by a federal judge in Alabama, but the verdict was overturned in a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling in May 2007. The court said that even though she filed her complaint within 180 days of when she first learned that she was getting paid less than comparable male employees, she had failed to file within 180 days of the first unequal paycheck. After Tuesday's House vote, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the chamber had ""taken a bold step"" in passing the legislation. ""In doing so, it has injected fairness, reason and common sense back into policy,"" Pelosi said. The legislation, which passed the Senate on Thursday, now goes to President Barack Obama, who has promised to sign it into law. It is the first major piece of legislation Congress has sent to Obama for his approval. On the campaign trail, Obama and Republican nominee Sen. John McCain debated the bill. Obama heavily emphasized what he called the plan's benefits to working women, while McCain criticized it as a boon for trial lawyers. Pelosi said Obama called to congratulate her on the bill's passage. Obama danced with Ledbetter at one of his inaugural balls, and she spoke at the Democrat National Convention at which he accepted his party's nomination. ""My case is over -- I will never receive the pay I deserve,"" Ledbetter said in that speech. ""But there will be a far richer reward if we secure fair pay for our children and grandchildren, so that no one will ever again experience the discrimination that I did.""","President Obama has promised to sign Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act .

"Editor's note: Dr. Thomas H. Murray is chief executive of The Hastings Center, a nonprofit research institute on bioethics in Garrison, New York. Murray was formerly director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at Case Western Reserve University and president of the Society for Health and Human Values. Thomas Murray says doctors have responsibility for welfare of children conceived through IVF procedure. GARRISON, New York (CNN) -- The birth of octuplets to a California woman last week raised a boatload of issues that can distract us from the central ethical question posed by the case: How do we take children's well-being into account in reproductive medicine? Yes, it's puzzling why an unemployed single woman who already had six children wanted a passel more. And it is not crazy to wonder who will pay for these children's needs over the years, beginning with what is sure to be a gobsmacking bill for neonatal intensive care. For now, we can put aside the lifeboat problem: A human uterus is not built for eight passengers; the odds for each child to be born alive and healthy go down as the number in the lifeboat goes up. Her physicians offered to reduce the number of fetuses she was carrying; citing her moral convictions, she declined. As of the last reports, all eight survived. Still, knowing what we do about the many risks that come with being born too soon and too small, their medical course is likely to be complex and unsteady. What this case really does is split wide open a fault line running through infertility treatment in American medicine. People who show up at fertility clinics are adults. In the typical case, they've been trying to get pregnant for a year or more without success. When all goes well, a cycle of IVF (in-vitro fertilization) results in a pregnancy and the birth of one, perhaps two, healthy babies. As a son, a father, and now a grandfather, I can attest that there is no more important or enduring relationship in our lives than the one between parents and children. Whether that relationship is forged through infertility medicine, adoption or the old-fashioned way matters not at all: What counts is that adults who want to love and raise a child are matched with a child who needs just that love and care. The point of infertility treatment, after all, is to create a child. But that child-to-be is not the clinic's patient -- the would-be parents are. I believe that the interests of those children deserve at least as much consideration as the wishes of the prospective parents. The vast majority of infertility patients are no doubt fierce advocates for the well-being of the child they so earnestly seek to bring into their lives. What happens, though, when the client's request shows little consideration or regard for the welfare of the would-be children? What happens if a woman in her early 30s with six children wants eight embryos implanted all at once? A responsible physician could turn down such a request, citing professional guidelines that counsel implanting one, at most two, embryos in women younger than 35. How Nadya Suleman ended up with eight is a mystery. That's what Nadya Suleman is claiming. Perhaps there is a physician somewhere willing to defy the wisdom of his or her peers; perhaps Suleman used fertility drugs rather than IVF as she claimed. Whatever the case, this guideline is based on safety. Carrying more than a couple of fetuses is dangerous to the pregnant woman and to the health and survival of the fetuses in her womb. Citing safety is a prudent way to turn down requests an infertility physician thinks are ill-considered. But sometimes that gambit isn't available. A psychiatrist friend who conducted intake interviews for a well-respected clinic described a rough-looking couple who carried for their up-front payment thousands of dollars in cash stuffed in a bag -- drug money, she was certain. She was able to discourage the couple from following through on their plan. Here's the rub: Her concern was the ultimate well-being of the child that the clinic was being asked to help create. But the ideology of American infertility medicine allows physicians to escape from making any judgments about the suitability of prospective parents. There is understandable worry that cracking the door to considerations about parents' motives and capacities would blast it wide open for nasty, petty stereotypes and prejudices. That would be an awful result. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine acknowledged in a 2004 report that fertility programs may withhold services when they can provide ""well-substantiated judgments"" that the child will not receive adequate care. But that same report has a huge loophole. Providers can abdicate almost all responsibility to anticipate the welfare of the children they help create by claiming ""an obligation to treat all patients who would benefit from medical treatment."" The statement goes on to say that ""except when significant harm to a future child is likely,"" they ""should not be required to make assessments of a patient's child-rearing abilities or other child welfare issues."" It's time for the profession -- and business -- of reproductive medicine to accept their firm, inescapable ethical obligation to give the interests and well-being of the children they help to create the same consideration they give to the desires of the adults they serve. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Murray.","Thomas Murray: The case of the birth of octuplets in California raises questions .

"(CNN)  -- Police said they are pursuing leads in the death of 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, whose body was found Monday stuffed into a suitcase in a dairy-farm pond near her Tracy, California, home. Sandra Cantu, 8, disappeared March 27. Her body was found at a dairy-farm pond near her Calilfornia home. ""We are heading in a direction,"" Tracy police Sgt. Tony Sheneman told reporters. ""To comment on that would compromise the investigation, and I can't do that."" A search warrant was executed at the Tracy mobile home park where the girl lived, and a related search was to be conducted Tuesday at a nearby church, he said. He implied more than one person may have been involved in the death of Sandra, who had been missing since March 27. ""Investigators are looking at additional information they received since yesterday and, hopefully, that will lead us to Sandra's killers,"" he said. Asked if his use of the plural meant police were looking for more than one person, he responded, ""We have no specific suspects, ma'am."" Sheneman also implied the killer likely was familiar with the location where the body was found. He said he himself was unfamiliar with the location where the girl's body was found, despite having lived in the community for nearly 12 years. ""Someone would have to be familiar with that area to know to go there,"" he said.  Watch how the suitcase was found » . Sheneman said police had no one in custody, despite having interviewed hundreds of people regarding the case. ""Everyone that we speak to right now is being considered a person of interest,"" he said. ""We're not eliminating anyone."" The autopsy was being conducted Tuesday, but it was not clear when the report would be available. ""It's going to be some time before we hear from the coroner,"" Sheneman said. ""I can't tell you when that's going to be."" More than 10 search warrants have been executed as part of the investigation and ""a lot"" of evidence has been recovered, Sheneman said. The day Sandra was last reported seen, she returned home from school, kissed her mother and left to play with a friend who lives nearby. A short time later, wearing a pink Hello Kitty T-shirt and black leggings, she left to go to another friend's home, according to a family spokeswoman.

Department of Homeland Security Director Janet Napolitano would not confirm such a breach, but said Wednesday that there has been no known damage caused by one. ""There have been, to my knowledge, no disruptions of power on any grid caused by a deliberate cyberattack on our infrastructure -- on the grid,"" Napolitano said. ""Nonetheless, we remain in constant protection, prevention, education, resiliency mode and we work with the utility sector particularly on that.""  Watch security officials explain threat » . The U.S. power grid isn't the only system at risk. The former officials said malicious code has been found in the computer systems of oil and gas distributors, telecommunications companies and financial services industries. Napolitano said the vulnerability of the nation's power grid to cyberattacks ""has been something that the Department of Homeland Security and the energy sector have known about for years,"" and that the department has programs in place to fight such attacks. Security experts say such computer hacking could be the work of a foreign government -- possibly Russia or China -- seeking to compromise U.S. security in the event of a future military conflict. Former CIA operative Robert Baer said he is not aware of a specific breach like the one the former officials describe. But he said people in the intelligence community assume that such attacks from countries like China go on all the time. ""Their foreign intelligence service has been probing our computers, our defense computers, our defense contractors, our power grids, our telephone system. ... I just came from a speech at the national defense university and they were hit by the Chinese trying to get into their systems,"" Baer said. ""They are testing and have gotten in portals. It's a serious threat."" Baer said if the software was embedded by a foreign government, he doubts it would be used to launch a surprise attack. Instead, he said, that government likely would keep the bugs in place in case of a future conflict with the United States. ""It's deterrence in the event of war,"" he said. ""They will have another weapon at their disposal, which will be to turn off our power."" When the coding is found, it can be destroyed. But experts said that's easier said than done. ""If you have somebody who knows what they're doing writing that code and embedding it in a clever way, you can look right at it and not recognize it,"" said Scott Borg, director and chief economist at the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit, an independent research institute. And even when it's found, Borg said, confirming the source of a cyberattack can be next to impossible. ""Anonymity is a fact of life in the cyberworld,"" he said. ""It's very easy to run an attack through somebody else's computer. It's very easy to embed code in Russian or Chinese when you're not Russian or Chinese. ""So it's very difficult to be confident on where anything like this comes from."" Critics of the utilities industry have accused it of not doing enough in the past to defend against cyberassaults. But Ed Legge, spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, which represents shareholder-owned electric companies, said the industry takes the threat seriously and has made progress in closing some of the loopholes that would allow such attacks. President Obama has started a 60-day review of all the nation's efforts at cybersecurity that is expected to be completed by April 17, Napolitano said. While utility grids are owned by industries, not the government, Napolitano said her department will continue working with power companies and other industries to help prevent an attack that could cripple power or other vital services. ""Can we continue to work to enhance efforts within critical infrastructure like the utility grid? Yes,"" she said. ""Are we continuously looking for ways to enhance and educate for the prevention and protection of the cyberworld? Absolutely. ""Is this a priority of the president's and of all of us that are involved with safety and security? You bet.""","2 ex-federal officials say U.S. electrical grid, other infrastructure targeted .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The pilot of a small Cessna 172 aircraft reported stolen from a Canadian flight school has been captured, authorities said. The pilot was flying a plane similar to this one -- a Cessna 172 -- before he landed in Missouri. The pilot reportedly stole a small Cessna 172 aircraft from a Canadian flight school, flew hundreds of miles across the Midwest, landed on a dirt road in Missouri late Monday and took off on foot, federal officials said. Federal, state and local authorities launched a manhunt for the pilot, who was identified by the FBI as Adam Leon, 31, a native of Turkey who became a Canadian citizen last year, according to FBI spokesman Richard Kolko. He was formerly known as Yavuz Berke, though officials did not indicate a reason for the name change. He was taken into custody at an Ellsinore grocery story after a brief manhunt, according to Missouri state police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A federal law enforcement source said the pilot parked the plane under what appeared to be a bridge or culvert, apparently in an attempt to hide it. The plane had been intercepted and tracked by U.S. military aircraft as it flew from Canada into U.S. airspace and meandered southward for several hours before landing, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman said. It landed in the town of Ellsinore, population 360, in southern Missouri, a dispatcher with the Carter County Sheriff's Office said. A spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said the pilot flew ""erratically"" over the course of the afternoon, at time reaching 14,000 feet in altitude, then dropping as low as 3,000 feet. The Cessna departed the school in Ontario at about 3 p.m. ET and flew over Lake Superior less than half an hour later, according to NORAD officials. F-16 fighter jets intercepted the pilot near Michigan's upper peninsula border with Wisconsin at 4:43 p.m., and tracked the Cessna until its safe landing. The NORAD spokesman, Mike Kucharek, said military pilots who intercepted the Cessna had tried repeatedly to get the pilot's attention and at one point, the pilot appeared to acknowledge that he saw the other aircraft. ""He looked at them,"" Kucharek said. But the pilot had not communicated with NORAD or the Federal Aviation Administration, Kucharek added later in the evening. At 9:20 p.m., the pilot was believed to have had roughly 30 minutes of fuel left, Kucharek said. ""We don't want to suppose the motive of the individual,"" Kucharek told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" after the landing. ""But it certainly made a day for the professional pilots that were flying these missions and a very serious situation from a NORAD perspective."" Officials allowed the pilot ""to play his hand"" because they ""[didn't] want to provoke the situation,"" Kucharek said. A federal law enforcement official told CNN the pilot is a naturalized Canadian citizen, but declined to give his name or country of origin. The source said the pilot was a flight school student for a ""brief"" period and only clocked a few hours of flight time. Canadian officials have received some information that the pilot is ""not a happy individual,"" the official said. The Cessna departed at about 3 p.m. ET and flew over Lake Superior less than half an hour later, according to NORAD officials. F-16 fighter jets intercepted the pilot near Michigan's upper peninsula border with Wisconsin at 4:43 p.m., and have tracked the Cessna since. Earlier in the evening, the Wisconsin National Guard deployed two F-16s of its own in an attempt to get the pilot to establish communications with FAA air traffic controllers. The state capitol in Madison, Wisconsin, was evacuated for less than an hour as a precaution. FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said the plane was reportedly stolen from a flight school in Thunder Bay, Canada, and the pilot had been identified as a student at the flight school. Both Lt. Cmdr. Gary Ross of NORAD and Brown of the FAA said the 14,000-feet altitude is above the level at which the FAA requires use of oxygen. Brown said it was not clear whether the Cessna had supplemental oxygen on board. Ross says the plane is a long-range version of a Cessna 172. It was fully fueled, giving it about seven hours of flying time. Ross said if NORAD officials believe the aircraft poses a threat, ""we take seriously any intent to harm any of our citizens or critical infrastructure."" He added that ""all options are on the table although we continue to move towards a resolution that doesn't call for [lethal force].""

"(CNN) -- In anticipation of more flooding next week, residents of Fargo, North Dakota, began stacking sandbags Wednesday for the second time in just over two weeks along the banks of the Red River. A trucker relaxes April 1 on sandbag pallets in Fargo, North Dakota,  which is preparing for more flooding. They hoped to fill 1 million, said Fargo spokeswoman Karena Lunday. ""If we get a million, that will be a total of 4 million we've made since the flood started,"" she said. The first sandbag effort began about March 23. The Red River crested at nearly 41 feet at Fargo on March 28, breaking a record that had held since 1897, when the Red River reached 40.1 feet. The National Weather Service issued a flood warning Tuesday, predicting that melting snow -- and possibly rain -- will start to raise river levels on the Red River south of Oslo, Minnesota, this week. Lunday said forecasters expected the river to crest there between April 16-18, possibly reaching 35 feet on April 14. ""I don't think people are as worried as they were the last time, but the possibility of getting up to 40 feet is a concern,"" Lunday told CNN. The Red River meanders along the border between North Dakota and Minnesota, so many other cities also were bracing for flooding.","Fargo spokeswoman says city has goal of filling 1 million more sandbags .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Wendell Lawing's eyes light up as the 88-year-old man talks about his last flight in a B-17 bomber. Wendell Lawing, 88, recently flew on a B-17 for the first time since World War II. ""We were going to Berlin, and we were flying around 20,000 feet. Suddenly, Me 109s headed out of the clouds,"" said the Atlanta native, referring to Germany's Messerschmitt fighter aircraft. ""We had a big fight, a running fight, and I personally saw my waist gunner shoot down one of those Me 109s right outside the window."" Seconds later, his bomber was struck in the plane's radio room. Lawing, who was the radio operator, already had moved farther back in the plane. ""I was back at the waist gun. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here today. We were set afire, and I was told to bail out, and I bailed out."" The Liberty Belle, a restored World War II-era B-17 like the one Lawing flew in, starts a nationwide tour this weekend in Atlanta. Its mission is to remind Americans of the sacrifices made by their fathers and grandfathers over the skies of Europe. It's also sure to spark the memories of servicemen who flew in them. Lawing's plane went down on the outskirts of Berlin in 1945. Two of his crew mates never got out of the plane. As he tells a small crowd the story at Atlanta's Peachtree DeKalb Airport, he is overcome with emotion and walks away briefly to gather himself. When he returns, Lawing talks about how he was captured on the ground and spent the next several months as a prisoner of war before U.S. Gen. George Patton's Third Army freed him. Lawing is one of two veteran bomber crew members who have been invited out to the airport by the Liberty Foundation. The foundation is responsible for resurrecting and flying this B-17, often referred to as the ""Flying Fortress"" because of the 13 machine guns carried aboard the plane. Of the 12,732 B-17s built during the war years, only 12 continue to fly. ""Our role is to fly this aircraft as a flying museum, to teach younger people the history of WWII,"" said Ron Gause, a foundation volunteer and part-time pilot of the Belle. ""It is in honor of those men and women who fought and died for us. And to honor those men who are still living. Some of them fly on the aircraft with us, and we get to hear their stories of what happened to them during WWII. That's the icing on the cake."" But it's not just veterans who get to relive the B-17. Each weekend, for nine months out of the year, the plane tours the United States, providing an opportunity for young and old to take a 30-minute flight on the Liberty Belle. ""It's a wonderful 30 minutes. You get to move to all of the combat positions other than my seat,"" said Ray Fowler, the Liberty Belle's chief pilot. ""The best seat in the house is the bombardier seat in the front. It's a great experience."" But this ""experience"" doesn't come cheap. It costs $430 for nonmembers of the foundation to fly a mission. Fowler said the money allows the group to keep the plane airborne. ""About half that is to break even just to fly the plane. The rest goes to operating costs."" The fuel costs are the weekend's single largest expenditure. It costs roughly $91,000 to fill the tank, and the four engines burn 200 gallons of fuel an hour. ""There are a lot of forces trying to put these things in a museum,"" Fowler said. ""We want to keep these things flying for the public. It's strictly based on public donations, and we hope to keep it flying for years."" The Liberty Belle was built in 1945 but never saw combat. No longer needed, the plane was sold for scrap before being passed around to several entities before the Liberty Foundation bought it in 2000 and restored it. Liberty Foundation founder Don Brooks then had it painted as the ""Liberty Belle"" to honor his father who flew on the original Belle in the 390th Bomb Group during the war. Fowler, who is a Continental Airlines pilot when he is not flying the Belle, said it's important to remember the high casualties B-17 crews suffered during World War II. ""It's just staggering to think about,"" he said of the more than 45,000 B-17 crewmen killed or wounded during the war years. ""But we tell everybody never pass up an opportunity to tell these guys thank you."" Jonathan Swift, 84, can't say how many missions he flew. The former bombardier remembers at least 30. ""I was just busy and didn't keep up with it,"" he said. ""Somebody asked me if I ever got shot at,"" Swift said, recalling, ""Yes, every mission and you were scared."" He said he's grateful for what the Liberty Foundation is doing. ""Of course it means a lot to me. ... Thousands [of B-17s} were just destroyed,"" he said. Lawing said he's also appreciative. Lawing ended his first flight aboard a B-17 since his fateful leap in 1945, gingerly climbing out through the fuselage hatch to show his fellow passengers how he escaped. His smile reveals that at least this day, the Liberty Belle's mission has been a success.","Liberty Foundation begins tour of World War II-era B-17 in Atlanta this weekend .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hip hop is one U.S. commodity that has made it past the trade embargo to Cuba. Cuban rap duo ""Doble Filo"" say hip hop allows them to embrace social issues. Cuba has developed a homegrown rap movement, inspired by the sounds and fashions of U.S. hip hop. But what makes Cuban rappers different is that rather than celebrating bling, girls and guns, their lyrics address social issues in a country where free speech is tightly controlled. Cuban rap began to surface in the 1990s, a grassroots affair, with songs recorded in rappers' bedrooms and distributed on cassette tapes. The island's fledgling hip hop scene was given a boost in 1999, when it was endorsed by the government as ""an authentic expression of Cuban Culture."" In the following years the government set up the Cuban Rap Agency (CRA) to promote the scene, as well as a record label, ""Asere Productions,"" and a rap magazine called ""Movimiento."" Government approval helped Cuban hip hop emerge from the underground, but some see that endorsement as a gilded cage. Formed in 1996, rap duo ""Doble Filo"" (""Double Edged"") have been part of the Havana scene since the beginning and work with the Cuban Rap Agency. But rapper Irak Saenz admits there are contradictions in being part of the system. ""It does limit our creative freedom,"" he told CNN. ""The CRA has an agenda that goes with the government's agenda. It doesn't limit me but it does force me to be creative in how I express my ideas."" Along with fellow Cuban rap duo ""Los Aldeanos"" (""The Villagers"") ""Doble Filo"" work with U.S. hip hop audio/visual label, Emetrece Productions. But ""Los Aldeanos"", who formed in 2003, are part of a younger generation of Cuban rappers. They don't belong the CRA, and nor do they want to. They are defiantly underground and outspoken. ""Hip hop is an art form speaks the truth about how people are living,"" says Aldo Rodriguez, one half of Los Aldeanos. Their track ""Niñito Cubano"" is about a young boy growing up during Cuba's ""special period"", when the fall of the Soviet Union brought hardship to the island. Their forthright lyrics about life in Cuba don't make them any friends among Cuba's authorities, and that limits their opportunities on the island. ""Our lyrics don't always go with the standard Cuban rhetoric and often that won't get airplay,"" says Rodriguez. ""I can be famous in other countries, but here they won't let me play a concert in a theater."" Listen to Doble Filo and Los Aldeanos here » . Doble Filo's Saenz has performed the U.S. with fellow Cubans ""Obsesion"", a tour that included playing on the same bill as U.S. rap stars Kanye West and The Roots. He says that where his generation of rappers was forced to limit the way it talked about the realities of daily life, the new generation is bolder with its lyrics. Bian Rodriguez, also known as El B, the other member of ""Los Aldeanos,"" says hip hop gives voice to the concerns of ordinary Cubans. ""People tell me they need this music, not just because they can identify with what we are saying, but because they feel that maybe we can say things they might be afraid to say publicly,"" he told CNN. Like most other Cuban rap groups, ""Los Aldeanos"" aren't yet in a position to make a living from their music. El B has won Cuba's Red Bull freestyle rapping championship three years in a row, but he still has a day job as a primary school teacher. A lack of funds and equipment means the island's hip hop producers have to use a certain amount of ingenuity when it comes to recording their music. Doble Filo's producer Edgaro explains that in the group's early days, he would make tracks by looping the last few bars of songs on cassette tapes. These days, Edgaro produces songs on his PC, but the software is pirated from copies brought into the country and circulated on the streets. It simply isn't available in the stores. More about Cuba's arts: Carlos Acosta takes CNN on a tour of Havana. » . As the scene develops the groups are getting more ambitious. Doble Filo are now incorporating live musicians into their sound, weaving in elements of traditional Cuban music, and they are set to release their debut album ""Despierta"" (""Wake up"") through Emetrece Productions. Emetrece is run by Melisa Riviere, a Ph.D. candidate in the Anthropology Department at the University of Minnesota. More than just promoting good music, she says Emetrece is trying to educate, and to challenge the U.S. embargo on Cuba. Like Cuba's rappers, she sees hip hop as a tool for social change. As El B puts it, ""I think one of the things people take from the music is the idea that we can do anything, we can change anything, we can be anything we want.""","Cuba's homegrown rap scene is known for its socially conscious lyrics .

"(CNN) -- A 93-year-old World War II medic who froze to death last month in his Bay City, Michigan, home left his entire estate to a local hospital, an estate attorney told CNN Wednesday. Martin Schur poses with his wife, Marian, in 1976. Local and state officials agree that Schur's death was avoidable. The attorney would not disclose the exact amount left behind by Martin Schur. But his nephew said his uncle indicated to family members two years ago that he had saved up more than a half-million dollars over the years. Schur and his wife, Marian, who died more than a year ago, did not have any children. ""I just know at one time he said he had over $600,000 in savings,"" said William Walworth. ""That's what he told me and my brother, and he was proud that he was able to save and build his estate up to that."" Cathy Reder, an attorney negotiating on behalf of Bay Regional Medical Center and the Schur family, said she was filing paperwork in probate court Wednesday for the court to determine the validity of the will. A hearing has been set for March 17. Reder would not specify the amount left to the hospital, other than to say it's more than $1. ""The will leaves everything to Bay Medical Center,"" she said. The hospital had no immediate comment. Walworth said his uncle was a frugal man who hadn't eaten at a restaurant for over 30 years. ""He was very tight, and he was very frugal. But he did manage to save a lot of money."" He said it's possible his uncle's estate could be less than $600,000, but he believes it's still ""sizable."" ""Knowing my uncle, that's him,"" Walworth said. ""He loved his community. He loved Bay City, Michigan."" He added, ""Hopefully his death is not in vain and we can learn from this, and he's still able to save lives. ... He was a very unique, special person in my life. I'm proud of what he was able to do in his life."" He said he hopes his uncle's message will spur others to ""look out for their neighbor."" The size of the estate -- if it's as large as the nephew believes -- adds another tragic twist to Schur's death. The power company limited his electricity because he owed about $1,000.  Watch neighbor say the death is ""unforgivable"" » . Schur's death last month shocked Bay City, a town of about 37,000 on Lake Huron's Saginaw Bay. The World War II veteran's frozen body was found in his home January 17, just four days after a device that regulates how much power he uses -- installed because of failure to pay -- shut off his power. A medical examiner said the temperature was 32 degrees in the house when Schur's body was found. The medical examiner told The Bay City Times that Schur died a ""slow, painful death."" ""It's not easy to die from hypothermia without first realizing your fingers and toes feel like they're burning,"" Dr. Kanu Virani told the paper. The Michigan State Police launched an investigation into Schur's death for possible criminal violations. ""We have to do everything we can to make sure this doesn't happen again, whether it's Bay City or in any one of the cold weather states,"" Bay City Mayor Charles Brunner said last week. The death has prompted a review of Bay City Electric Light & Power's rules and procedures for limiting or cutting off power. It also resulted in Bay City residents protesting Monday to the city about its handling of the whole situation. A neighbor who lives down the street called Schur's death ""unforgivable."" ""This can't be allowed to happen in this country,"" said Jerome Anderson. Walworth said he believes his uncle's death was ""preventable."" ""It should never have happened. It's a tragic loss,"" he said. ""I had a lot of fond memories of my uncle, and that's the type of memory I don't want to have: Him freezing to death."" Utility officials said Schur owed about $1,000 resulting in a ""limiter"" being put on his home. Limiters are devices that cut power as a warning for people who haven't paid their bills. Limiters can be reset to restore a lesser degree of power until a bill payment is worked out. In Schur's case, the limiter was never reset, and it's unclear whether he knew how to do that. Schur had been living alone since his wife died, Walworth said. Unlike private utilities regulated by the state, Bay City runs and oversees its own utilities and therefore doesn't fall under Michigan's public service commission. By law, Michigan requires private companies to prohibit cutting off service to senior citizens between November and April. Seniors must register for the program. The city has begun questioning whether its rules and procedures for limiting or cutting off power need a major overhaul. The utility has stopped its practice of cutting power to customers who don't pay their bills. The utility also has removed all ""limiters"" on homes. Walworth said someone should have looked at Schur's payment history and made direct contact to see whether something was wrong. He's hoping the nation will learn from his uncle's death. ""Hopefully, some good can come out of this. I'm still an optimist."" CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Martin Schur, 93, froze to death in his home last month; leaves estate to hospital .

"(CNN) -- Her school has become a symbol of the kind of crumbling infrastructure that President Obama hopes his stimulus bill will improve. South Carolina student Ty'Sheoma Bethea was invited to the speech after she wrote a letter to lawmakers. But on Tuesday, Ty'Sheoma Bethea became the face of the issue, when she joined first lady Michelle Obama as her guest for the president's first speech to a joint session of Congress. The White House invited Bethea, a student at the J.V. Martin Junior High School in Dillon, South Carolina, after a letter she sent lawmakers appealing for help rebuilding her school made its way to the president. The eighth-grader flew with her mother, Dina Leach, from South Carolina to Washington to attend Tuesday night's speech. On Wednesday, back home in South Carolina, Bethea explained what she wanted the president to do. ""I just want for him to help my school out and to get us a bigger and better school and build us a new one, and I would thank him for that."" she told CNN. The eighth-grader was inspired to write the letter by Obama, who mentioned her school in his first presidential news conference on February 9. After visiting the school, he referenced J.V. Martin as evidence of educational institutions that would benefit from school construction funding in his $787 billion stimulus package. iReport.com: 'A very emotional moment' In her letter, Bethea described the dilapidated condition of her school, which was built in 1896, and said the funds would improve the building and the quality of education. ""We are just students trying to become lawyers, doctors, congressmen like yourself, and one day president, so we can make a change to not just the state of South Carolina, but also the world.

""It was great to hear the president say my quote,"" Bethea said Wednesday. ""We are not quitters because anything is possible, and I don't think we should give up so easily. We should work harder for it."" Poorly maintained and ill-equipped schools in South Carolina's ""corridor of shame"" were an issue during the Democratic primary as evidence that education reform had to be an imperative for the next president. The schools became an issue again last week when South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican, said he might turn down some of the money in the stimulus. And South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, said turning down money was an ""insult"" to blacks. ""We have legislation here now with the money to do something about the schools, do something about water and sewage along that corridor in these 12 counties. And now the governor says, 'I don't want to accept the money.' That's why I called this an insult, that's why I said this is a slap in the face, because a majority of those counties are, in fact, inhabited by African-Americans,"" Clyburn said on CNN's Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. In his speech Tuesday, Obama vowed that education is among the priorities of his administration. He urged Americans to take advantage of the promise of an education.  Watch Obama discuss education » . ""In a global economy, where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity.

"LONGMONT, Colorado (CNN) -- A Colorado solar-energy company has high hopes for the economic stimulus bill that President Barack Obama will sign Tuesday in Denver. AVA Solar CEO Pascal Noronha holds one of the solar panels his company produces. Obama touts that the stimulus bill will help create up to a half a million so-called ""green"" jobs in the field of alternative energy. Colorado has a growing green energy industry. Executives of AVA Solar, based in Fort Collins, Colorado, are among green energy industry representatives invited to the bill signing. AVA Solar has its plant in Longmont, about 30 minutes north of Denver. The plant, set to begin production in the spring, will construct solar panels for solar power plants. Once production is up to speed, CEO Pascal Noronha says, the plant should create enough solar panels a year to power 40,000 U.S. homes. Noronha says AVA Solar needs two things: Government loans to expand its factory, and more government assistance to help power companies commit to building large solar power plants in the United States. iReport.com: What would you fix first? Noronha says those two moves would help AVA Solar create 1,000 to 2,000 new jobs in its factory, plus added employment for its suppliers. The company, founded in 2007, currently has 175 employees. Without the stimulus, Noronha said, AVA Solar is on track to create 420 new jobs by the end of this year. AVA Solar currently operates on $175 million in U.S.-based private venture capital. In 2007 the company also received $3 million in seed money from the U.S. Department of Energy. Noronha says Obama is on the right track in terms of the stimulus bill. ""What everybody needs is a little seed money because five years from now there's no question [that] solar has to replace the oil that we import,"" Noronha says. ""What the government needs to do is provide the traction that is needed to get the first few projects on the ground."" ""We need money from the federal government ... to facilitate production immediately,"" the CEO adds. ""Otherwise, we will be sitting and waiting for projects in the U.S., and if we have to wait one year or two years -- when we're able to produce a solution for this country today -- that is a really good reason for the government to say, 'Here it is, let's go.' "" Noronha says his company's biggest customer base is in Germany, a country that is far ahead of the United States in embracing solar energy. Obtaining U.S. customers is a priority, he explains. ""As a company we would very much like to have customers here in the U.S.,"" Noronha says. ""The government needs to be able to facilitate these customers by making it possible for them to put large-scale power plants up."" Noronha is optimistic about the stimulus bill and the direction of the Obama administration. ""If you look at the vision of the president, you know he is looking out in the future and saying we've got to reduce our dependence on foreign oil,"" Noronha says. ""Well, to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, there is only renewable energy. And there are two forms that are promising -- one is wind and the other is solar. And solar, you've got the sun's resources all over the world.""","Solar-panel company has high interest in stimulus bill .

"JUAREZ, Mexico (CNN) -- Jose Molinar knew something wasn't right. He hadn't heard from his wife for a few hours, which was not sitting well with him. Marisella Molinar was killed while driving her boss, a target of cartels, across the border into El Paso, Texas. Marisella Molinar worked as a secretary for a top prosecutor in Juarez, Mexico, Jesus Huerta Yedra. She was employed in the office for more than 10 years and though she lived across the border in El Paso, Texas, with her husband, she drove about 20 minutes over the Juarez-El Paso border every day to the job she loved. The growing violence over rival drug cartels had concerned the couple, but Mexico was a part of their lives and they were sure the violence stayed between rival drug gangs, who were fighting over a lucrative drug route into the United States. Without fail, Marisella Molinar would call her husband every day when she arrived to work, went out for lunch and when she was leaving the office. But on December 3, 2008, by around 5:30 p.m., Jose Molinar still hadn't heard from his wife. He called the office in Mexico and was told she was giving her boss a ride over the border so he could do some Christmas shopping. Jose Molinar turned on his television, and his life changed forever. ""As soon as the image came up, I saw her truck,"" said Molinar, who was watching the news out of Juarez, ""and I knew what happened right then and there.""  Watch Jose Molinar talk about the moment he knew his wife was killed » . Marisella Molinar was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Her passenger, Jesus Huerta Yedra, was a target of the cartels that day. As Molinar's car was about a mile away from the border crossing back to the United States, gunmen walked up to her car and fired 85 rounds from an AK-47 into their intended target. One shot hit Marisella Molinar, a mother of two and proud grandmother, in the chest, killing her instantly. ""She wasn't involved, she didn't have anything to do with this!"" said Jose Molinar in a recent interview with CNN. ""She was the guy's secretary and she was giving him a ride to meet his wife here in El Paso who was Christmas shopping."" But instead of making it home to help her husband hang Christmas lights, Marisella Molinar became yet another victim in the drug war taking place just steps from the U.S. border. The violence generated by the war of the drug cartels for control of drug routes translated last year into some 6,000 killings. More than 1,600 of them occurred in Juarez, three times more than the most murderous city in the United States. This year, in two months, the body count in Juarez is 400. Mexican military and police in riot gear now patrol the once popular streets of Juarez. Gone are the Americans shopping, dining and partying. The bars and restaurants are shuttered -- many closed for good. Americans don't come here anymore. In March 2008, the Mexican military joined with Mexican states and local law enforcement in the fight against drug cartels in border cities. Mexican President Felipe Calderon has waged a war against business as usual with the cartels who controlled drug routes through Mexico and into the United States. The fallout has led rival drug gangs to launch all-out war not only with the military, but also with each other, because the once-established drug routes are now up for grabs. The violence has been the worst in Juarez, where cartels have killed police officers, forced the chief of police to resign and threatened public officials. ""They started killing police officers, and not when they were doing police work, but when they were coming out of their homes and getting into their cars to go to the police station,"" said Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz, whose own family has recently received death threats. At the city's only morgue, bodies are piling up. The mayor said there are far too many dead for the small facility to handle. The majority of the dead are unidentified members of the cartels. Just last week, the mayor said, 50 corpses were buried in mass graves because no one claimed the bodies. Officials from both sides of the border said the drug war may go on for years. Beheadings, bodies riddled with gunfire and blood-stained streets will continue daily, they said. They added that the appetite for illegal drugs is too great in the United States, and the drug routes are too lucrative for the battles to end. ""It's not going to be won quickly,"" said Enrique Torres, a spokesman for the Mexican government, adding that the Mexican president is committed to fighting the cartels. ""He can't talk about a time frame in this type of situation. We know the monster is big, but we don't have an idea of how big it is.""","Marisella Molinar, a secretary, was killed nearly a mile from her U.S. home .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Mexican authorities have detained the country's former drug czar on suspicion that he may have accepted $450,000 a month in bribes from drug traffickers, Mexico's attorney general said Friday. Noe Ramirez Mandujano was in charge from 2006 through August of fighting organized crime in Mexico. Noe Ramirez Mandujano was in charge from 2006 until this August of the attorney general's office that specializes in combatting organized crime. Ramirez is accused of meeting with members of a drug cartel while he was in office and agreeing to provide information on investigations in exchange for the bribes, Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora Icaza said at a news conference Friday. The arrest was part of an ongoing investigation called ""Operation Limpieza,"" or ""Operation Cleanup,"" the attorney general said. The operation targets officials who may have passed information to drug cartels. The arrest was announced Thursday night, four days after the house arrest of Ricardo Gutierrez Vargas, the director for International Police Affairs at Mexico's Federal Investigative Agency and the head of Mexico's Interpol office. Authorities say more than 30 officials have been arrested since July in connection with the anti-corruption operation. Interpol, which is based in France, announced Wednesday it is sending a team of investigators to Mexico to investigate the possibility that its communications systems and databases may have been compromised, a prospect raised by the arrest of Gutierrez, the top official working with the agency in Mexico. ""A war of master proportions"" between authorities and narcotics traffickers and traffickers among themselves has left more than 4,300 dead so far this year, according to the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, an independent research and information organization. By comparison, the council said in a report this week, there were 2,700 drug-related deaths in 2007. ""Homegrown drug cartels operating from both within and outside the country are engaging in a vicious turf war to seize control of major trafficking corridors while engaging in almost open warfare against the mobilized forces of the state,"" the council said about what it calls ""narco-fueled crime."" Mexican leaders have been trying to tamp down the violence by tightening controls on money-laundering and cracking down on corruption among local and municipal police forces infiltrated by drug traffickers. It may not be enough. ""Due to pervasive corruption at the highest levels of the Mexican government, and the almost effortless infiltration of the porous security forces by the cartel, an ultimate victory by the state is far from certain,"" the Hemispheric Council concludes. Drug trafficking in Mexico is a $20 billion- to $50 billion-a-year industry, as much as the nation earns from tourism or remittances from Mexicans living in the United States, said Robert Pastor, a former National Security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and now a professor of international relations at American University in Washington. He has been studying Latin America for more than four decades. ""This is a huge industry with an extraordinary capacity to corrupt and intimidate the country. And they're doing both right now,"" said Pastor, also a former director of the Carter Center's Latin American and Caribbean Program. The drug cartels are paying some Mexican officials bribes of $150,000 to $450,000 a month, authorities have said. This in a country where the per capita income is $12,500 a year and one of every seven Mexicans lives in poverty, according to the CIA World Factbook.","Noe Ramirez Mandujano arrested, suspected of taking $450,000 a month in bribes .

"AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (CNN) -- The nationalities of the people killed in the Turkish Airlines plane crash near Amsterdam's main airport have been identified as five Turks and four U.S. citizens. Masked investigators work at the crash site Thursday. Among the dead were two Boeing employees, among four onboard the flight, their company said late Thursday in a posting on its Web site. A third was hospitalized, and a fourth employee's fate was not yet known, the company said. None of their identities have been released. Investigators were trying to determine what caused the crash of the aircraft, a model with a good safety record flown by a well-respected airline at one of the world's most modern airports. The crash split the plane into three parts, as it was arriving at Schiphol from Istanbul, Turkey, around 10:40 a.m. (4:40 a.m. ET). Flight 1951 went down in a farmer's field about 500 yards short of the runway in favorable weather conditions. It had 135 people onboard. Among those injured in the crash, 63 remained hospitalized Thursday, six of them in critical condition, said Theo Weterings, the mayor of Haarlemmermeer municipality, where Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is located. Another 25 passengers were severely injured, an official said Tuesday. Authorities have confirmed the nationalities of all but 15 of the passengers and crew, Weterings said. Those on board the flight included 53 Dutch, 51 Turkish, seven Americans, three Britons, and one each from Germany, Bulgaria, Finland, and Taiwan.  Watch crash survivors return home » . ""I want to express my deepest sympathies again to the victims of TK flight 1951,"" Weterings said. One week ago, an employees' union accused Turkish Airlines of ""inviting disaster"" by ignoring aircraft maintenance, it emerged Thursday. The Turkish Civil Aviation Union alleged on its Web site on February 18 that Turkish Airlines ""is ignoring the most basic function of flight safety, which is plane maintenance services."" ""The company administration does not understand the consequences of ripping people from their jobs and inviting a disaster."" The union, which represents 12,000 Turkish Airline employees, is involved in an ugly dispute with the company's management.  Watch how survivors described crash » . Turkish Airlines posted a statement on its Web site on Thursday saying it takes safety seriously and that it followed all ""maintenance procedures of the plane manufacturer, national and international authorities directives"" for the plane. Two days before the crash, the company statement said, the pilot of the plane reported failure with the ""Master Caution Light"" while taxiing. The part was replaced, and ""after this replacement, the plane had eight take-offs and landings and there were no problems,"" Turkish Airlines said. In the wake of the disaster, Turkish Airlines executives and officials from Turkey's Transportation Ministry said the Boeing 737-800 had last been inspected December 22.   See where 737-800 has been involved in previous incidents » . ""There was no problem with maintenance in the records of the plane,"" Candan Karlicetin, executive board chairman of Turkish Airlines, said in a news conference just hours after the crash. Teams of investigators arrived at the crash site just after daybreak and set up a large white tent. They fanned out over the debris field, where the white fuselage of the Boeing lay in three pieces. A special Turkish Airlines flight landed in Amsterdam Thursday morning from Istanbul, carrying about 70 relatives of those on board the fatal flight. The relatives were accompanied by trauma specialists, the airline said. The flight data and voice recorders were recovered. Turkish officials have also ruled out weather conditions as a possible reason for the crash. Dutch and Turkish authorities say they await the results of an international investigation into the cause. Aviation experts say Turkish Airlines has a relatively good safety record, though in 2003, more then 70 people were killed when a Turkish Airlines domestic flight crashed in fog near the southeastern city of Diyarbakir. Turkey's flagship carrier had been expanding its routes and fleet of aircraft in recent years. Hollywood actor Kevin Costner was recently hired to star in an advertising campaign for the company. Costner's commercials were to be broadcast in 70 countries. An employee in Turkish Airlines' advertising department said the promotional campaign was suspended in the wake of the fatal plane crash.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- With thousands of Americans looking for jobs, many businesses are saying: Sorry, we're not hiring. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is sending out another message: Come right this way. Donna Gill Lumpkin is one of more than 270,000 people to apply for about 2,950 jobs at the FBI. After years of being outgunned in the battle for job applicants by corporations who could pay bigger salaries, hundreds of thousands of job seekers are applying for FBI positions. The FBI announced a hiring blitz in January to fill more than 2,100 professional staff positions. The job postings run the gamut from scientists to accountants to auto mechanics. In addition, the bureau said it wants to hire 850 FBI agents. What happened next caught many at the FBI by surprise. More than 270,000 people applied over about six weeks. The FBI said about 70,000 people seek positions in a normal year. But this isn't a normal year. Just ask Donna Gill Lumpkin, a divorced mother of two who lives in Maryland. Gill Lumpkin lost her job selling radio ad time in November. ""The competition is really stiff,"" she said. ""There's a lot of people out of work. A lot of people looking for a job."" Gill Lumpkin has applied for a job as an FBI recruiter. If the FBI thinks she has the skills for the post, that's just one step toward a job. She'll have to undergo an FBI background check and take polygraph and drug tests.  Watch the applications pile up at the FBI » . The FBI official in charge of human resources concedes the FBI is benefiting a bit from the sour economy and getting a flood of applications this year. ""In years past it was often difficult to find people with the science and technology background or chemistry background or a biology background because we were competing with the private sector,"" said FBI Assistant Director John Raucci. Raucci said during the dotcom explosion, the FBI had a difficult time competing with dotcom start-up salaries. ""Now, what we offer is stability, we offer a job and I think a very exciting environment in which to work,"" said Raucci. Raucci said the average starting salary at the FBI is about $35,000 per year. But he adds those with extraordinary academic credentials and prior job experience start at a much higher rate. Donna Gill Lumpkin said the stability of a job with the federal government and the good benefits such as health insurance attracted her to apply. ""In this tough economic climate right now the federal government, I think, is one of the most steady and stable places anyone could be."" The stakes are high for Gill Lumpkin, who has a 12-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son. She said her children are covered under her ex-husband's health insurance. But she needs coverage for herself. And she is not able to put any money away right now for her children's college years. ""Right now the college fund is on pause,"" said Gill Lumpkin. ""It's the survival fund. We are trying to survive.""","Hundreds of thousands of job seekers are applying for FBI positions .

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has apparently released a new audio message calling for a jihad, or holy war, against Israel for its Gaza campaign. Osama bin Laden, in an undated photo, apparently taped a message calling for jihad against Israel. The 22-minute message contains ""an invitation"" from bin Laden to take part in ""jihad to stop the aggression against Gaza."" The audio message was posted on a radical Islamist Web site that has posted other statements from bin Laden in the past. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the message, but the speaker's voice was similar to other recordings that bin Laden has made. While not naming President-elect Barack Obama, bin Laden refers to the future of the United States in the face of the current global economic crisis.  Watch as experts discuss Osama message » . ""[America is] now drowning in a global financial crisis,"" he said. ""They're even begging all nations, small and large, for help. America is no longer feared by its enemies nor respected by its allies. ""The decline of the American power is one of the main reasons for Israel's rushed and barbaric aggression on Gaza in a desperate attempt to take advantage of the last days of [President] Bush's term in office."" He appears, however, to refer to Obama, saying ""Bush leaves his successor with the worst inheritance ... two long guerrilla wars and no options. He either withdraws and faces military defeat, or carries on and drowns his nation in financial trouble.""  Watch Obama comment on bin Laden's message » . The message also names Vice President-elect Joe Biden. ""Here is Biden, the vice president of the president-elect ... [he] says that the crisis is bigger than they expected and that the American economy, all of it, is open to collapse,"" bin Laden said. On December 20, Biden said in an interview that the economy ""is in much worse shape than we thought it was in."" White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the message ""demonstrates [bin Laden's] isolation and continued attempts to remain relevant at a time when al Qaeda's ideology, mission and agenda are being questioned and challenged throughout the world."" He noted that the message also appears to be ""an effort to raise money as part of [al Qaeda's] ongoing propaganda campaign."" ""The United States promotes an alternative, hopeful ideology while continuing to partner with over 90 countries to pursue terrorists wherever they are,"" Johndroe said. The last time bin Laden released an audio message was in mid-May, timed to coincide with Israel's 60th anniversary. That message urged his followers to liberate Palestine. Israel launched a military offensive in Gaza on December 27 to stop Hamas rocket strikes on southern Israel. The death toll in Gaza was nearing 1,000 on Wednesday, including more than 300 children, according to Palestinian medical sources. The Israeli toll stood at 13, including three civilians, according to Israeli police and military officials. Bin Laden, who is about 51, is the head of the al Qaeda terrorist network, which was responsible for the September 11, 2001, attack on the United States that killed 2,751 people. He's been in hiding since the U.S. assault on Afghanistan that followed the 9/11 attacks. The U.S. government is offering a $25 million reward for information leading to his capture. President Bush, whose term ends next week, told CNN's Larry King on Tuesday that he remains optimistic that bin Laden would be found. Asked by King, ""Are we ever going to find bin Laden?"" Bush replied: ""Yes, of course, absolutely. We've got a lot of people out there looking for him, a lot of assets. You can't run forever."" The message is important to the incoming U.S. president because it signifies that bin Laden is still ""out there,"" said Tim Roemer, a former Democratic congressman from Indiana who served on both the congressional and the presidential September 11 commissions. ""It's a reminder of President-elect Obama's inheritance of some of the difficult problems out there that he has to confront,"" said Roemer, who is president of the Center for National Policy. ""Al Qaeda is trying to be relevant with this tape,"" Roemer said. ""They seek competition with Hamas, Hezbollah, the ongoing battle between Israel and the Palestinians. ... ""This reminds us of what bin Laden said right after 9/11. He said it wasn't 19 Arab armies or 19 Arab states that attacked the United States. It was 19 post-graduate students. It reminds us how much the world has changed, and how many different threats are out there today.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Hugh Hefner founded Playboy magazine 55 years ago and turned the adult-oriented publication into a multimillion-dollar empire. CNN anchor John Roberts recently sat down with Hefner, now 82, and talked about Steven Watts' new book, ""Mr. Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American Dream."" Hugh Hefner, 82, says that ""staying young is what it is all about for me."" John Roberts, CNN anchor: Mr. Hefner, good to see you. Hugh Hefner: It is my pleasure. Roberts: You have over the decades certainly supported political causes, you've supported Democratic causes. I'm wondering what your thoughts are regarding the pending inauguration of Barack Obama and where you think the country is headed in the next four years. Hefner: Well, where the country is headed is obviously a question we would all like to know. But I, certainly, [say] this [is] a time for a change. I supported Obama. I'm delighted that I lived to see a black president. I think he's a very good man. I think we've had ... eight of the worst years in my memory. And we hope that Obama can make some difference.  Watch the interview with Hugh Hefner » . Roberts: You know in the 1950s and through the '60s and the early '70s you were such a factor in the sexual revolution in this country. With the election of Barack Obama, do you believe that the cultural revolution has come to an end? Hefner: It's always ongoing. You know, we remain essentially a puritan people. And so I think that conflict is always there. One got a remarkable revolutionary change in pop culture and in moral values in the '60s and '70s, and then there was a backlash. And that backlash, I think, has influenced government. And, um, the Christian right has had, played a major role in all of that. And I think that the complicated problems with religion being involved with politics hopefully will come to an end for a while at least. Roberts: Now in 1953, when you first launched Playboy magazine, you seemed to be the right publication for the right time. I know that you were very heavily influenced by the Kinsey Report, which had come out not too long prior to that. But 55 years later, is Playboy magazine still relevant? And if it is, how do you keep it relevant? Hefner: Well, I don't think obviously it will ever play the same kind of role that it played back in the 1950s and '60s. But I do think that a magazine of quality always has a place. Increasingly, obviously fewer people are reading magazines and fewer people are reading newspapers and books, but I think that part of that is a change that Playboy is always, is also embracing. We're very much involved with the Internet. We were the first magazine to use [the] Internet and have our own Web site. So I think that we'll continue to publish and publish both the magazine and then publish through electronics. Roberts: The new Steven Watts biography is a fascinating, very fascinating look at your entire career, from your roots all the way up until the present. And he says, looking back over it, that ""the key to his approach was that he edited Playboy for himself. Aiming it at his own tastes and values."" Was that also a key to your success as well that you approached this with such a personal passion? Hefner: I think so, but I think that is one of the things that makes magazines unique. They do speak with a personal voice. And I think it is one of the things that makes magazines special. Roberts: Now this, of course, has been a family enterprise. You founded the magazine, your daughter Christie took over as CEO of the company in 1982. She has been there for 26 years, but she's stepping down later on this month. Will you be able to still maintain that same - I don't want to say ""quality"" because I'm sure the quality was there -- but can the business continue in the fashion it has for the past 55 years? Hefner: Well, only time will tell. If you're talking in terms of family connections, I have two teenage sons. As a matter fact, there was an interview with Marston and Cooper in the current January issue. Roberts: I saw it. Hefner: Marston has just turned 18 and is at Trinity College. Cooper will be graduating in June and will be going to USC, and both have an interest in the magazine. Roberts: So you'll be able to continue that legacy into the future? Hefner: That is my hope. Roberts: Hugh, in the early part of the 1980s you ran into a number of problems. You were attacked on a number of different fronts by Reagan conservatives, the feminist movement, business started to suffer. Of course, there was the murder of 1980 Playmate of the Year Dorothy Stratten and charges that you had exploited her. A recent article in the Baltimore Sun described those times this way. It said: . ""Many now viewed Hefner as an anachronism: A creepy old guy padding around the mansion in slippers, pajamas and smoking jacket, pathetically cavorting with the same young bimbos and living the dissolute life of an aging Lothario -- the sexualized Peter Pan who refused to grow up."" How did you overcome all that and survive another 25 years in the way that you have? Hefner: Well, I think that's probably the great question. One of the big questions is ""Why is the brand so hugely popular again?"" There was a period in the '80s and '90s on which we were in the shade, and the brand has become hugely popular again. Part of it because of the television show. The television show is a global phenomenon. And what is unique about it is the fact that it is more popular with women than with men. Roberts: I know. The program you are talking about is girls gone wild ... sorry, ""Girls Next Door."" It's heading into its sixth season. And one of the statistics I saw is that 78 percent of the viewers are women. How do you think you've tapped into that market? Hefner: Well, we certainly didn't anticipate it. The original notion of doing the show through the eyes of the girlfriends seemed inspired because it took a lot of the pressure off of me. Because I'm a very busy guy. I still am very busy involved with the business and with the magazine. So the notion of doing a reality show through the eyes of the girls was a good idea because it took the pressure off the old man. What we didn't anticipate, of course, was as a result ... it is a hugely popular phenomenon with women and that, of course, is really welcome. Because we knew that we were going to have the guys so the fact that the magazine and the brand is now hot with young women bodes well for the future. Roberts: Of course, the three principals in ""Girls Next Door"" are Holly, Bridget and Kendra, and we know that there has been a bit of a change in the relationship between you and Holly, at the very least. Will they be back again next year for the next season? Hefner: Yes, all three of the girls are scheduled for season six. It will be a season of transitions and we will be meeting some of the new girls, too. Roberts: You're 82 years old now? Your latest girlfriends are a pair of 19-year-old twins, Karissa and Kristina Shannon. You are 63 years older than they are. A lot of people would say, ""How do you do it?"" And other people might say, ""Are you ever going to grow up?"" Hefner: Well, I'm never going to grow up. Staying young is what it is all about for me. Holding on to the boy and, um, long ago I decided that age really didn't matter and as long as the ladies ... feel the same way, that's fine with me. Roberts: Well, you're definitely the youngest 82-year-old I've ever seen. Hugh Hefner, thanks for being with us today. Hefner: My pleasure always. Roberts: Take care.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Mega-rich Middle Eastern investors are the latest wave of businessmen being linked with some of the biggest clubs in English soccer. Sulaiman Al Fahim eyes Chelsea, while Liverpool's fans also see a change of ownership looming. They follow an influx of 'foreign' owners led by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, and Americans at Manchester United and Liverpool. Sheikh Mansour, a member of the oil-rich Abu Dhabi royal family, has transformed the financial fortunes of Manchester City -- a team long in the shadow of its more successful neighbor United -- since buying the club last summer. He bought Brazilian Robinho for a record £32.5 million ($45 million) at the start of the season, has spent millions more on players in the January 2009 transfer window and had a bid to sign Kaka, a former World Player of the Year, for a record-busting £100 million ($138 million) fail. At the weekend British newspapers suggested that two of the Premier League's ""Big Four"" are attracting the attention of wealthy Gulf investors. Not for the first time, the Kuwaiti Al Kharafi family was linked with Liverpool FC, currently owned by Americans Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Meanwhile, Dr Sulaiman Al Fahim, an Emirates property mogul and TV personality, is fronting an audacious bid to buy a controlling interest in Chelsea from Abramovich. Jassim al Kharafi has shot down speculation that his family is interested in buying Liverpool. The Kharafis, who made much of their estimated $9.7 billion fortune in construction and fast-food interests, have been in talks with Liverpool before. They considered a bid last year after the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, abandoned his efforts to buy the club. But that may not be the end of the story. Some analysts think potential suitors are biding their time, as Liverpool's current American owners approach the deadline for refinancing their takeover of the club. That would mean renegotiating the terms of a whopping £350 million ($550 million) loan by July. Most analysts think it highly unlikely in the current economic climate that the banks will want to refinance the loan. So if the Kharafi family denies interest in the club, that may be an act of brinkmanship to drive down the price as the July deadline looms. Dr Sulaiman Al Fahim, on the other hand, has already successfully overseen one takeover. He came to the public's attentions after fronting the Abu Dhabi United Group's bid for Manchester City, only to be removed when he made several audacious claims concerning City's future transfer policy. Now he's back, fronting a collection of investors who want to get their hands on Chelsea FC. ""It's not entirely clear if Chelsea is for sale, but regardless of that, we first need to see if we are in a position to buy it,"" Al Fahim told Arabian Business.com. ""Given that Roman Abramovich has invested over £500 million ($694 million)  into the club, it would not be cheap...but through a number of investors, there is money available to put together a deal."" The moves highlight just how important money from the region has become. Manchester City has already smashed the British transfer record after signing Robinho and paid what many think are generous fees for other players during a slow transfer window. Middle Eastern investors have been offered the chance to buy anyone from Newcastle United, who are enduring a poor season in the Premiership, to Charlton Athletic, struggling in the second tier of English football. Companies based in the Gulf have been involved in huge sponsorship deals, like the Dubai-owned Emirates Airline who gave Arsenal £100 million for naming rights for their stadium. Not everyone is happy however. UEFA president Michael Platini has criticized the influx of foreign owners into the Barclays Premier League, claiming that clubs are losing touch with their roots as a result. ""Do you want in Liverpool an Arab sheikh as president with one Brazilian coach and nine or eleven African players?"" Platini said at a news conference last October. ""Where is Liverpool in that? We have to make some rules."" Is Platini right? Have your say. With half a dozen Premier League clubs known to be up for sale, and Arab investors looking like the only ones willing to do the buying, Kharafi and Fahim won't be the last names the footballing world hears from the Middle East. What do you think? Is Platini right to be wary of foreign owners? Is the Premier League becoming too dependent on Middle Eastern money? Or is the influx of money and big names a refreshing shot in the arm for European football? Have your say.","Two new Arab investors look to buy Liverpool and Chelsea .

"(CNN) -- Every dog has his day, but Sir Lancelot -- or at least his carbon copy -- has a second one. Edgar and Nina Otto show off 10-week-old Lancey, a clone of ""the most human of any dog we've ever had."" A Boca Raton, Florida, couple paid a California firm $155,000 to clone their beloved Labrador retriever, who died from cancer a year ago. The clone, a 10-week-old puppy dubbed Lancey, was hand-delivered to them earlier this week by Lou Hawthorne, chairman of BioArts International, a biotechnology company. ""One minute with Lancey and you know he's special. He's both extremely aware and very sweet,"" Hawthorne said in a BioArts statement. Edgar and Nina Otto said they began thinking about cloning Sir Lancelot about five years ago. ""I said 'Well, you know, it wouldn't hurt to have his DNA frozen,' and that's what we did,"" Nina Otto told CNN affiliate WPBF. The Ottos were one of five families to bid and win a BioArts auction for a chance to clone their family dog, according to a BioArts statement. Lancey is the world's first commercially cloned dog, the company said; the Ottos are the first of six current clients to receive their clone. Sir Lancelot's DNA sample was sent to the Sooam Biotech Research Foundation in Seoul, South Korea, which provides cloning services to BioArts. Researchers there put the DNA into an egg, and Lancey was born November 18, according to BioArts. The Ottos said they have had many beloved dogs over the years -- and have nine others currently -- but maintain Sir Lancelot was special. ""Sir Lancelot was the most human of any dog we've ever had,"" Edgar Otto said in the BioArts statement. ""He was a prince among dogs."" In an interview with WPBF, Edgar Otto said Sir Lancelot ""was a very, very, very special dog to us. And we've given a lot more to the Humane Society than we've ever spent on this project.""  Watch the Ottos talk about Lancelot and Lancey » . For its part, the Humane Society of the United States says it's against the commercial cloning of animals. ""Given the current pet overpopulation problem, which costs millions of animals their lives and millions in public tax dollars each year, the cloning of pets has no social value and in fact may lead to increased animal suffering,"" the organization said on its Web site. ""For those looking to replace a lost pet, cloning will not create an animal identical to the one who is gone; cloning cannot replicate an animal's uniqueness. Cloning can only replicate the pet's genetics, which influence but do not determine his physical attributes or personality."" The Ottos, however, said replicating Sir Lancelot's genetics is enough for them. Edgar Otto said he realizes Lancey might not be just like their departed dog, but ""if he's different, we're not going to love him any less."" Edgar Otto is the son of the late Edwin Otto, who was part of the founding of NASCAR and a ""motorsports pioneer,"" according to www.ottomotorsports.com.","Couple won auction to clone family dog, biotech company says .

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles police have launched an internal investigation to determine who leaked a picture that appears to show a bruised and battered Rihanna. Rihanna was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, before the Grammys on February 8. The close-up photo -- showing a woman with contusions on her forehead and below her eyes, and cuts on her lip -- was published on the entertainment Web site TMZ Thursday. TMZ said it was a photo of Rihanna. Twenty-one-year-old Rihanna was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, on a Los Angeles street before the two were to perform at the Grammys on February 8. ""The unauthorized release of a domestic violence photograph immediately generated an internal investigation,"" an L.A. police spokesman said in a statement. ""The Los Angeles Police Department takes seriously its duty to maintain the confidentiality of victims of domestic violence. A violation of this type is considered serious misconduct, with penalties up to and including termination."" A spokeswoman for Rihanna declined to comment. The chief investigator in the case had told CNN earlier that authorities had tried to guard against leaks. Detective Deshon Andrews said he had kept the case file closely guarded and that no copies had been made of the original photos and documents. Brown was arrested on February 8 in connection with the case and and booked on suspicion of making criminal threats. Authorities are trying to determine whether Brown should face domestic violence-related charges. Brown apologized for the incident this week. ""Words cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired,"" the 19-year-old said in a statement released by his spokesman. ""I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God's help, to emerging a better person.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton was in the White House on multiple occasions when her husband had sexual encounters with Monica Lewinsky, according to newly released documents. The National Archives released 11,000 pages of Hillary Clinton's schedule as first lady. The National Archives on Wednesday released more than 11,000 pages of Clinton's schedule when she was first lady. Sen. Barack Obama's campaign pushed for the documents' release, arguing that their review is necessary to make a full evaluation of Clinton's experience as first lady. But the documents also provide a glimpse into Clinton's life during her husband's publicized affair. The scandal involving former president Bill Clinton and Lewinsky, first broke in the national media on January 21, 1998. According to the documents, Hillary Clinton started that day at a private meeting in the White House. She later made an appearance at a college in Baltimore, Maryland, and stayed there until late in the afternoon before returning to the White House for a black-tie dinner.  Watch where Hillary Clinton was during the scandal » . The schedules reveal where Clinton was, but provide no indication of how she dealt with the controversy. Carl Bernstein, who wrote a biography of Hillary Clinton, said there was much more going on behind the scenes. ""She was on the telephone with her aides, she was trying to learn more about what the press was doing, she did not want to give the impression of a firestorm that was raging outside,"" he said. On the day her husband made his first public admission -- August 16, 1998 -- she was on a trip to Martha's Vineyard. She had no public schedule for the days that followed. And on December 19, 1998 -- the day the House voted to impeach her husband -- the calendar shows a holiday party. A dance between the president and first lady is listed as ""optional."" The papers show Hillary Clinton had no public schedule on the day independent counsel Kenneth Starr was appointed to investigate Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, or on the day Bill Clinton was deposed in the case. On the day the affair began -- November 15, 1995, according to Starr's report -- Hillary Clinton had a private meeting and a meet-and-greet with then-Vice President Al Gore and Nobel Prize winners. Lewinsky said she and the president had an encounter in the bathroom outside the Oval Office study on January 7, 1996. This is the same day the president and his wife had a small dinner gathering at the White House, according to the documents. The president and Lewinsky also had a sexual encounter on February 4, 1996, according to Lewinsky. On this day, the president and Hillary Clinton went to the National Governors Association annual dinner. Hillary Clinton kept up a busy schedule as the affair spiraled into impeachment. Thousands of pages are marked by redactions -- blacked-out information like the names of people who attended meetings. ""This is not about someone who is eager to shine a light on her full record. That's the point. And at the same time, some of this is understandable -- when you're running for office, the slightest thing can be misinterpreted,"" Bernstein said. But the schedules also show her involvement in policy -- she dove into health care reform just three days after her husband's inauguration in 1993, and dozens of related events followed. Despite her efforts, the Clinton health care reform foundered in Congress. Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said the trove of documents ""shows she was a co-president,"" revealing an ""extraordinary extent of meetings for an unelected official to be meeting with cabinet officials."" The documents cover nearly 2,900 days. An additional 27 days will be posted in the near future, the archives said. The documents are among those at the center of a legal battle between the archives and Judicial Watch, a conservative public interest group that has long urged a speedier release of files from the Clinton White House years. In a court motion this month, the archives promised to release the schedules by the end of the month but said it will need ""one to two years"" to process remaining documents, including more than 20,000 pages of call logs -- well after the November 4 presidential election. A Clinton spokesman said the lawsuit had nothing to do with the release, and the Clinton team had nothing to do with the redactions. A key aide to the Clintons actually fought to un-redact some parts, the spokesman said. According to the archives statement, 4,746 of the schedules have redactions that largely relate to privacy concerns including Social Security and telephone numbers and home addresses. ""We'll look them over, and may ask the court for relief if it looks like something important is missing,"" Fitton said of the redacted information. He said Judicial Watch continues to demand phone logs from Clinton's time in the White House. The documents are from the files of Patti Solis Doyle, director of Clinton's scheduling as first lady, the archives said in a statement. Doyle stepped down as Clinton's presidential campaign manager in February after a string of poor showings in primaries. ""Arranged chronologically, these records document in detail the activities of the first lady, including meetings, trips, speaking engagements and social activities for the eight years of the Clinton administration,"" the archives said. The records were simultaneously released on CD-ROM at the William J. Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas, and at the archives in Washington. The documents are also available for view on the Clinton Library's Web site. E-mail to a friend .

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- An Australian author imprisoned last month for insulting the king and crown prince of Thailand was on his way home Saturday after receiving a pardon from the king. Harry Nicolaides behind the bars of a Thai holding cell. Harry Nicolaides, 41, was arrested last August over his 2005 book titled ""Verisimilitude."" The book includes a paragraph about the king and crown prince that authorities deemed a violation of a law that makes it illegal to defame, insult or threaten the crown. CNN has chosen not to repeat the language because it could result in CNN staff being prosecuted in Thailand. Mark Dean, a lawyer for Nicolaides, said he was released Friday and taken to the Australian embassy in Bangkok, where he stayed until leaving for Australia at about midnight. ""He is obviously very relieved and grateful that the pardon was granted,"" Dean said. Nicolaides was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty last month. He faced a term of up to six years before the plea.  Watch shackled Nicolaides at court » . His lawyers then requested the pardon. King Bhumibol Adulydej had pardoned foreigners in similar cases in the past. Dean said Nicolaides was deported from Thailand, but that he did not know of any other stipulations related to the pardon. In an interview with CNN International, Dean avoided repeating what Nicolaides wrote, but said the passage was presented as a rumor, not a fact. ""This is probably not the best time to repeat the passage that was found to be offensive,"" Dean said. ""But it concerned the crown prince of Thailand and a rumor that was being circulated in Thailand about the crown prince."" Nicolaides had been living in Thailand since 2003, lecturing at two universities about tourism. He was about to leave Thailand when he was arrested on August 31. It is not clear why the authorities waited three years after the publication of his book to bring charges against him. Fifty copies of the book were published, and only seven were sold. Thailand's king is highly revered in the Buddhist nation. But even he has said in the past that he can be criticized. Thailand's prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, also has told CNN he is concerned about what he called misuse of the law. Still, other cases of violating the law are pending before the Thai Criminal Court, involving both Thais and foreigners.","Harry Nicolaides, 41, was arrested last August over his 2005 book .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- If there were any justice, the divas who've been trading off the No. 1 slot -- Mariah, Madonna, and newcomer Leona Lewis -- would also be slugging it out with a platinum-blond dark horse from Scandinavia. Swedish singer Robyn performs in London on April 19. Enter Sweden's Robyn, who arrives Stateside with ""Robyn,"" an album that's a veritable parade of Songs of the Summer. After landing a few mediocre teen-pop hits in the '90s (namely ""Show Me Love""), she's forsaken her white-soul dullness for hooky dance-pop greatness with help from electro-favoring fellow Swedes like the Teddybears and the Knife. From the girly hip-hop of ''Konichiwa Bitches'' to the Eurodisco defiance of ''With Every Heartbeat,'' she's developed a real backbone to go with that asymmetrical 'do. Not since Pink's ""M!ssundaztood"" has an easily dismissed young thrush made so unexpected a leap to career artist. That comparison starts with Robyn's first single, ''Handle Me'' -- a less nasty but even hookier version of Pink's lounge-lizard-repelling ""U + Ur Hand."" But she hardly sticks to playing a tough cookie: The next song, ""Bum Like You,"" offers an amusing, knowing lesson in How to Fall for a Jerk 101. Meanwhile, in the pensive, timbales-'n'-synths-driven ""Who's That Girl,"" Robyn decries her guy's impossible standards. ""Good girls are pretty, like, all the time,"" she sings.

"(CNN) -- The Marines have been making children's Christmas dreams come true for nearly 60 years, but the corps may be seeing fewer smiles this year. Volunteer Betty Whelan sorts donated toys in a Toys for Tots center in Boston, Massachusetts. With demand up due to the poor economy and toy donations down, Toys for Tots, the Marine Corps' program that distributes Christmas toys to children in need, is facing one of its toughest years, according to Bill Grein, the Toys for Tots Foundation vice president. Grein said the program last year distributed approximately 16.6 million toys and books, but this year he doesn't think they will be able to reach that number. ""We always run out of toys before we run out of children,""  he said, but this year ""it's a major problem."" Grein said that the program is getting more requests than in previous years and cities like Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Miami, Florida; Fresno, California; Atlanta, Georgia, and many others are hurting for donations. ""Every kid deserves a present,"" said Marine Sgt. Daniel Sampson of the Toys for Tots program in Boston, Massachusetts. ""Right now, we're not sending out as much as we should be."" In the Washington area, the Marines need to find toys for 82,000 children, but ""we are tens of thousands of toys behind,"" Master Sgt Timothy Butler said. If they can't fill the need and get every child on the list a toy for Christmas, Butler said, ""It's gonna break my heart."" Last year, the Marines were able to raise $13,000 in donations from people at Union Station, a major commuter hub in downtown Washington, but this year the Marines will be ""lucky to get half that,"" Staff Sgt. Johnny Noble said. In Atlanta, Toys for Tots administration chief Edward Barrett said they had received 241,814 donations, well short of their goal of 800,000. Barrett understands that the economy has a lot to do with the lack of contributions, and he estimates that donations are down by about 30 percent this year. In San Francisco, California, Gunnery Sgt. Timothy Anthamatten said the Toys for Tots program there was also seeing a 30 percent decrease in toy and monetary donations. In Boston, last minute donations came to the rescue. According to volunteer Kay Carpenter, the Boston Toys for Tots program used money that came in last week to buy $15,000 worth of toys, hopefully, enough to fill all of their orders. But, nationally, Toys for Tots bins are still empty. ""We're Marines and we set goals,"" Edwards said, ""and when we can't achieve those goals that's frustrating.""

"(CNN) -- What appears to be a separated human foot inside a shoe -- possibly the sixth discovered in Canada's British Columbia in the past 15 months -- has been found on a riverbank, Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Wednesday. Some of the feet found this year washed up on Westham Island, south of Vancouver, British Columbia. The shoe -- a left New Balance running shoe -- was found about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday on the south arm of the Fraser River by a Richmond, British Columbia, couple, police said. It was turned over to the British Columbia Coroners Service for examination and DNA testing, authorities said. Before Tuesday, five feet -- all inside running shoes -- had washed ashore in southern British Columbia since August 2007. One of them, a right New Balance shoe, was found May 22 on Kirkland Island. That foot was determined to belong to a female, authorities said.  View a map of where the feet washed ashore » . The provincial coroners' office said in July that DNA tests determined that two of the five feet -- a right foot found February 8 and a left foot found June 16 -- were from the same male, but they said they didn't know to whom any of the feet belonged. What was initially thought to be a sixth foot inside a running shoe, found in June, was determined to be a hoax. Authorities said a ""skeletonized animal paw"" was put in the shoe with a sock and packed with dried seaweed. ""Obviously, due to the fact that a hoax was perpetrated previously and then extensively reported on, we want to proceed cautiously [with Tuesday's discovery] until we know what exactly we are dealing with,"" said Constable Annie Linteau, an RCMP spokeswoman. The provincial coroners' service said in July that the five sets of remains found to that point appeared ""to have naturally separated (disarticulated) from the body."" There was no forensic evidence, such as tool or trauma marks, on the remains to suggest that they had separated in any way other than decomposition, the service said. Authorities are investigating multiple possibilities on the origin of the feet, including foul play and the chance they could belong to victims of a plane crash. Missing persons files are also being reviewed. Four of the five feet discovered between August 2007 and June 2008 were in running shoes made between 2003 and 2004, and the other was made in 1999, according to police. Royal Canadian Mounted Police have released photos of the shoes, hoping someone can help identify the remains. Here is a timeline of the discoveries in British Columbia, according to police: . August 20, 2007 . The first foot is found by an American man and his 12-year-old daughter boating near Jedidiah Island. The shoe is later identified as a Campus brand running shoe, primarily white with blue mesh, and is believed to be a size 12. It is determined that it was produced in 2003 and distributed primarily in India. August 26, 2007 . The second foot is found on Gabriola Island by a resident walking on a trail. The shoe is a size 12 men's Reebok running shoe, primarily white in color. It was produced in 2004 and was distributed globally, though mostly in North America. It was first available March 1, 2004, but is no longer available. February 2 . A third foot is found by two forest workers on Valdez Island. The shoe is a size 11 blue and white Nike running shoe, made in 2003 and sold in Canada and the United States from February 1 to June 30, 2003. May 22 . The fourth foot is found on Kirkland Island by a man walking along the shoreline. The size 7 blue and white New Balance running shoe was made in 1999 and distributed in major retail stores.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- The wife of accused swindler Bernard Madoff pulled $15.5 million out of a Madoff-related brokerage firm in Massachusetts in the weeks before his arrest, authorities there disclosed Wednesday. Bernard Madoff is under 24-hour house arrest in his Upper East Side luxury apartment. The withdrawals by Ruth Madoff took place in November and December, according to a complaint filed by state regulators against Cohmad Securities, a firm they said was ""intertwined"" with Madoff's New York-based company. The regulators say Cohmad has refused to provide information about its ties to Madoff, who is accused of running a Ponzi scheme that may have cost investors up to $50 billion. Daily wire transaction reports show Cohmad was aware of transfers to and from Madoff-related accounts, the filing states. ""For example, the few reports produced by Cohmad show that Ruth Madoff withdrew $5.5 million on November 25, 2008 and withdrew $10 million on December 10, 2008,"" investigators said. Bernard Madoff, 70, was arrested December 11 and is currently under house arrest in his Manhattan luxury apartment. He faces one charge of securities fraud in connection with an international scheme that has cost some investors their life savings and could face up to 20 years in prison and a $5 million fine if convicted. In January, prosecutors tried to revoke his $10 million bail after he mailed more than $1 million worth of diamond-studded jewelry to friends and family, a move they said showed he was trying to move assets out of government hands. But a judge ruled Madoff was neither a danger to the community nor a flight risk. Prosecutors and Madoff's lawyers have agreed for a second time to push back the deadline for an indictment or probable cause hearing for the former investor, sources close to the case said Wednesday. The previous deadline of Wednesday -- which was itself a delay -- has now been moved back another 30 days. Madoff and the Securities and Exchange Commission already have agreed to a partial civil judgment against the disgraced investment manager, one that could eventually force him to pay fines and return investors' money. Under the terms of the deal, Madoff will keep a previously reached agreement to freeze his assets and not to violate any other securities laws, but it does not require him to admit or deny any allegations.

"(OPRAH.com) -- Decision-making can be challenging for anyone, but when a couple needs to make a collective decision, the challenge becomes greater, psychologist Dr. Josh Klapow says. Remind your partner that you are a team and collaboration is needed when facing differing opinions. The key is to recognize that the decision-making process is the same regardless of the type of decision, Dr. Klapow says. ""Making decisions as a couple is not so much about what you decide on, but rather how you go about the process of making the decision,"" he says. ""If you approach each decision with the same game plan, then over time, you will become experts at decision-making."" Dr. Klapow shares his five ""smart"" (set, monitor, arrange, recruit and treat) steps to collective decision-making. Set a specific goal . Make sure you are very specific about what you want, Dr. Klapow says. For example, a goal of saving money is not specific enough; however, saying that you want to save an extra $100 per month by automatic deduction from your paychecks to pay off your credit card is specific. ""The more specific you are, the better,"" he says. Monitor your discussion . As you are discussing the decision at hand, make sure you are staying on track, Dr. Klapow says. ""Very often couples will start discussing a goal and stray to some other topic, which can lead to frustration,"" he says. ""If you notice yourself or your spouse getting off the subject, quickly come back to the specific goal."" Oprah.com: The five best things to do for your relationship . Arrange the situation for success . Decision-making doesn't work well when someone is tired, hungry, short of time or preoccupied with other activities. ""Before you start the discussion, make sure each of you is in the right frame of mind and you have the time,"" Dr. Klapow says. If not, take a break from the discussion because it likely won't be productive. Recruit support from one another . A collective decision means that sometimes there will be a compromise, Dr. Klapow says. If you are going into the discussion to win, then you are not making a collective decision -- you are fighting a battle, he says. ""Remind each other that you are a team and that you are in it to win collectively, not necessarily individually,"" he says. Treat yourselves .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- For the first time since media coverage was banned in 1991, the return of the body of a fallen member of the U.S. armed forces was opened to news outlets late Sunday. A transport plane carries caskets of U.S. servicemen in this photo the Pentagon released in 2005. The U.S. Air Force informed media on Sunday that the family of Staff Sgt. Phillip Myers consented to allowing coverage of his casket being returned to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Myers, 30, of Hopewell, Virginia, was a member of an engineering unit based in Britain. He died Saturday in a roadside bombing in southern Afghanistan, the U.S. military reported. In February, President Obama and Defense Secretary Robert Gates overturned a policy that dated back to the first Persian Gulf war. They agreed to allow reporters to observe the remains of American troops being returned to the U.S. military mortuary at Dover, as long as families agreed. The policy was supposed to take effect on Monday, and no reason was given why reporters were allowed to view the proceedings on Sunday. Watch report on lifting of the ban » .","Family of Staff Sgt.

"(CNN) -- A British-owned cargo ship on Monday became the latest vessel to be seized by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. International naval patrols have been stepped up in the Gulf of Aden following increased pirate attacks. The 32,000-tonne Malaspina Castle was taken early on Monday and was believed to be heading towards Somalia's pirate-infested coast, the European Union's Horn of Africa maritime security center said. ""Few details are known at this stage, but the mixed-nationality crew is believed to be safe,"" a statement on the London-based organization's Web site said. The vessel, which is operated by an Italian company, carried a crew of 24, from Bulgaria, Ukraine, Russia and the Philippines, Britain's Telegraph newspaper reported. ""There have not yet been communications from the Malaspina Castle that we are aware of, so information is limited,"" said Andrew Mwangura of the Seafarers' Assistance Program in quotes carried by the Telegraph. He added: ""It is likely to be taken towards the Somali coast and negotiations will begin soon."" Meanwhile, the BBC reported that a Taiwanese fishing boat, with a crew of 29, was also hijacked Monday approximately 260km (160 miles) from the Seychelles. The latest attacks follow a string of incidents in the pirate-plagued waterway off Somalia at the weekend, with a French yacht, a Yemeni tugboat and a German ship also reported to have been seized. Last year, pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 off Somalia, according to the International Maritime Bureau. In response, a number of countries have deployed warships from their navies to the region, including the United States, China and Japan. Monday's seizure of the Malaspina Castle was immediately condemned by the UK ship masters' union Nautilus, which has long urged governments to take stronger action to deter piracy. Nautilus assistant general secretary Mark Dickinson told the British Press Association: ""Over the last 10 years, most governments have not really done very much about this. ""More recently they have been motivated to act and there is an EU naval coordination force patrolling off the Gulf of Aden."" He added: ""I'm not sure that this is going to be a long-term thing and I'm also worried that the pirates will start seizing ships well away from the areas being patrolled. ""In Somalia, piracy is like a big, successful industry and the authorities there need to act. The pirates are treated like local heroes. People look up to them and girls want to marry them. They are seen by some locals as good people but they are ruthless.""","32,000-tonne Malaspina Castle was taken early on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Researchers with a Malaysian university said they have uncovered evidence of an iron industry that dates to the 3rd Century, A.D., and proves that ancient civilizations in Southeast Asia were more advanced than once thought. The archaeologists from the Universiti Sains Malaysia found the remains of an iron smelting site, tools to pump oxygen into the iron smelting process, rooftops of buildings, beads and pots, said Mokhtar Saidan, a professor and leader of the team. The discovery was made after a month of excavation at Lembah Bujang, a historical site in Malaysia. ""This is the first discovery of the earliest iron industry in Lembah Bujang and has been dated conclusively. This date also adds on to the facts and data on the early history of Southeast Asia,"" he said. He said coal from the site was sent to a laboratory in Florida that said elements in the coal dated to the 3rd Century. The professor said the discovery confirms that human civilization in the area was more advanced than thought and the site probably was a place for exporting iron in the 3rd Century.","Researchers uncover evidence of Malaysian iron industry dating to 3rd Century .

"(CNN) -- Three police officers -- shot to death after responding to a domestic argument call -- will lie in repose at Pittsburgh's city-county building later this week, Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl told reporters Monday. A statue at Pittsburgh's police memorial is decorated with a bouquet after the deaths of three officers on Saturday. The public will be allowed to view the officers -- Stephen Mayhle, Paul Sciullo III and Eric Kelly -- from 4 p.m. Wednesday until 10 a.m. Thursday, Ravenstahl said. City offices will close at 2 p.m. Wednesday and remain closed Thursday, he said, adding that city offices were already closing for the Good Friday holiday. Following the viewing, the officers' bodies will be taken in a procession to an event center, where a public ceremony will be held at 1 p.m. Thursday, Ravenstahl said. Individual funerals will be held for the officers later. A fund for the officers' families has been established at a local police credit union, Ravenstahl said.  Watch mayor tell of plans to honor slain officers » . The three officers were shot to death Saturday after arriving at a Pittsburgh home in response to a 911 call about an argument. Court papers said the argument was triggered by a urinating dog. Richard Poplawski, 22, is in custody in connection with the shootings. He was hospitalized over the weekend after he was shot in the leg during a four-hour police standoff; his whereabouts were unclear Monday. Police said Saturday that he would be charged with three counts of homicide, aggravated assault and other charges. Details of the incident were included in the police complaint seeking an arrest warrant for Poplawski. The complaint says Margaret Poplawski called 911 about 7 a.m. Saturday to report that her son was ""giving her a hard time."" She told police she awoke to discover that ""the dog had urinated on the floor,"" and awakened her son ""to confront him about it."" The two had an argument, and Margaret Poplawski told her son she was calling police to remove him from her home, according to the complaint. When Mayhle and Sciullo arrived, she opened the door and let them in. ""Mrs. Poplawski reported that as the officers entered approximately 10 feet into the residence, she heard gunshots, turned and saw her son about six feet away with a long rifle in his hands, at which point she fled downstairs after asking him, 'What the hell have you done?'"" the complaint said. Margaret Poplawski reported she stayed in the basement during the standoff, and heard her son yell, ""Yeah, I've been shot,"" and ""I'm standing down, come in and help me,"" according to the complaint. Kelly was a 14-year veteran of the department, Police Chief Nathan Harper has said, while the other two had worked there for two years each.  Watch officers respond at the scene » . The chief said Sciullo was the first to approach the home, and was shot in the head as he entered the doorway. When Mayhle tried to help his fellow officer, he also was shot in the head. Kelly arrived at the scene and was shot before he could aid the other two officers, Harper said. Harper said the suspect fired from a bedroom window, shooting at an armored vehicle carrying a SWAT team -- preventing those officers and medics from reaching the wounded policemen. Two other officers, Timothy McManaway and Brian Jones, were injured. McManaway was shot in the hand and Jones, who was trying to secure the rear of the house, broke his leg trying to get over a fence, Harper said. Autopsies showed that Kelly died of gunshot wounds to the trunk and lower extremities, Sciullo died from gunshot wounds to the head and trunk, and Mayhle was shot in the head, the complaint said. ""We have never had to lose three officers in the line of duty on one call,"" Harper, the police chief, said. ""They have paid the ultimate sacrifice."" Authorities believe Poplawski, wearing a bullet-proof vest, aimed more than 100 rounds at police, using an AK-47, Harper said Saturday. Police had responded to calls from the home two or three times previously, Harper said.","Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III were shot to death on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Fans of the character Easy Rawlins don't want to hear it, but author Walter Mosley says he has officially moved on. Author Walter Mosley found fame with his Easy Rawlins mysteries and has debuted a new series. The prolific writer seemingly wrapped up his beloved series -- which spawned the 1995 film ""Devil in a Blue Dress"" starring Denzel Washington -- in 2007 with the 10th Easy Rawlins mystery, ""Blonde Faith."" The ending saddened die-hard fans who had faithfully followed the adventures of the Los Angeles, California-based everyman-turned-private investigator whose stories played out in an era from the Jim Crow 1940s to the politically charged 1960s. Now Mosley, who has found success writing everything from erotica to science fiction, has launched a new mystery series with the release of his book ""The Long Fall"" (Riverhead). The book features an ex-boxer named Leonid Trotter McGill, the latest colorfully named Mosley character. Three of his previous books involved ex-convict Socrates Fortlow, and another trio concerned bookseller Paris Minton. But the new novel takes Mosley to a different place and time. Instead of mid-20th century Los Angeles, ""The Long Fall"" is set in modern-day New York, where McGill is finding it hard to leave his less-than-stellar past behind. That past includes a childhood as a red-diaper baby abandoned by his union organizer father and left to fend for himself at an early age, a loveless marriage to an unfaithful woman named Katrina and a son who's a burgeoning criminal mastermind. Moreover, he's at work on a case where you just know people are going to die. Such page turners are nothing new for Mosley, who is known for his strong, black male characters and his passionate musings on race, politics and the writing life. McGill's creator recently spoke with CNN about the new mystery novel, why he doesn't miss Easy, and how the changes in the United States are mirrored in his writing. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Why leave Los Angeles for a setting in modern-day New York? Walter Mosley: I have been a resident of both cities. The new series being contemporary and about a character who in some murky ways reflects where America is right now, New York seemed the right place for that. CNN: How so? Where do you think America is right now? Mosley: I think that America has made a decision, after about 20 years of going in one direction, to go in another direction: to leave rampant and amoral kind of deregulation and also rampant and immoral wars and say, ""Maybe we should be doing the right thing instead of the wrong thing,"" or redefining what the right thing is, at any rate. Those kinds of decisions, there are only two places [the setting] can be, and that's either in Washington, D.C., which I feel is very limiting because it's a one-business town, or New York, where everything from economics to government is centered. So I decided on New York. CNN: McGill is trying to leave behind his shady past. Do you feel like America is trying to do the same? Mosley: Yes, I think that's exactly what's happening. I think America is trying to seek redemption after having done many things wrong in the eyes of the world in general. Leonid McGill is trying to seek redemption after a long criminal history. His history is somewhat forgivable, but still it's criminal. CNN: Did you approach this book differently than you did when you were writing the Easy Rawlins mysteries? Mosley: Yes and no. All books are different, so each of the Easy Rawlins books I wrote I approached differently. [Leonid] is a new character and he has a unique life that I had to begin to learn. I knew Easy very well, but Leonid I had to learn who he was. CNN: In your new book, I love that McGill's wife's name is ""Katrina"" and she leaves lots of destruction in her wake. Mosley: [chuckling] It's true, but the first story I wrote about Leonid [a story called ""Karma"" published in the anthology ""Dangerous Women""] was before the hurricane and that was a long time ago. It's funny that it worked out like that. CNN: What do you like about McGill? Mosley: This is the first time in my experiments in crime fiction that I've written a hard-boiled detective character. This is going all the way back to the beginning of the genre in the '30s, where you have a guy who gets thumped upside the head a lot and he's just as bad as the people he's after. In the old style, you never knew what was going on inside the hard-boiled character's head, but in these stories I am actually discovering the underlying character of the hard-boiled detective, and for me that's been a great deal of fun. CNN: You've written so many various genres. What is it about the genre of crime fiction that appeals to you? Mosley: Originally I got into it because you can talk about worlds that people wouldn't read about ordinarily unless they had a particular interest in it. Everybody reads crime fiction and they read it to find out about different worlds. I like writing in different genres. There's all this stuff that I really enjoy doing because I think they all serve different purposes. And listen, I'm known as a crime writer, people like it and I enjoy it. CNN: For your fans, a lot of them miss Easy Rawlins. Do you miss him at all? Mosley: No, he's right there on the shelf. All I have to do is reach up and pull him down. I'm finished with that. I'm moving on.","Writer Walter Mosley is best known for his Easy Rawlins mystery series .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Despite a hardline U.S. policy, there is no reason why federal officials can't negotiate directly with pirates who are holding a U.S. captain hostage off Somalia, a counterterrorism expert said Thursday. Pirates have been plaguing commercial shipping vessels in the waters off the coast of east Africa. Nor is there anything to stop an independent party from paying for his release, said Juan Carlos Zarate, who served as deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism under former President George W. Bush. ""The U.S. has a very clear policy of no concessions; that's different than no negotiations,"" said Zarate, now is a senior adviser to the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The U.S. policy against concessions translates into a policy against paying for the release of hostages, he said. ""That means no ransoms, nothing of value in return for the safe release of hostages,"" he said. But, he added, ""It's also important to note that there's nothing in U.S. policy that restricts family members or private companies -- like a shipping company -- to actually pay a ransom. There's nothing that the U.S. government can do other than potentially to prosecute if that money is going to a known terrorist organization, which is a fine line."" Nevertheless, he said it is U.S. government policy to discourage private companies from making payments to hostage takers. ""The U.S. has a very clear sense that, if you start to pay ransoms, you in essence create an industry for kidnapping,"" he said. ""And, frankly, it's why you see an uptick in the piracy problem in East Africa. It's a for-profit venture. It's very lucrative at low cost for the pirates and it's, in part, fueled by the fact that shipping companies in other countries have been paying ransoms for the release of ships, cargo and personnel."" Zarate predicted the standoff off Somalia will not be resolved soon. ""I don't see or forecast the use of massive force inadvertently because of the potential for hurting our citizen,"" he said, referring to Richard Phillips, the captain of the Maersk Alabama who was taken hostage after four gunmen boarded it on Wednesday. ""And so I think this is going to take a while, and it may involve some third-party negotiations."" Though he approves of the government's handling of the situation so far, Zarate said the situation not an easy one. ""This, to a certain extent, is the U.S. government's nightmare scenario,"" said Zarate, who oversaw the U.S. government's counterterrorism strategy from 2005 to 2009. ""We had always planned for, but hoped that this kind of situation wouldn't happen -- where a U.S. vessel was taken or a U.S. citizen was taken in those waters,"" he said. He called the standoff ""a classic hostage situation, which is difficult to resolve. It is certainly difficult to resolve on the high seas where we have limited levers to play."" iReport.com: How should the U.S. respond? Zarate said the hostage holders appear to be in the stronger position, though at first glance -- four men holding a fifth aboard a 28-foot powerless lifeboat in the ocean hundreds of miles from shore -- that may not appear to be the case. ""I think they have the upper hand, in part, because we value the life of our citizens,"" he said. ""They may not value their lives as much, and they may not be using the same rational calculus that we would in this situation."" But, he said, the pirates may not be able to turn that advantage into victory. ""I think the good guys will win,"" he said. iReport.com: 'Stop the pirates, Obama!' ""I think we'll find a way out of this. I think the FBI hostage negotiators, the naval personnel on scene and others will find a way of negotiating their way out of this. They're professionals; they know how to do that. But it's difficult."" CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this story.","Paying ransom encourages more kidnappings for money, Juan Carlos Zarate says .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Los Angeles Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart was among three people killed in a crash in Fullerton, California, early Thursday, according to the team and a hospital spokesman. Los Angeles Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart was killed Thursday, hours after his fourth MLB start. Adenhart, 22, of Silver Spring, Maryland, died at UC Irvine Medical Center, according to spokesman John Murray. ""The Angels family has suffered a tremendous loss today,"" Tony Reagins, the team's general manager, said in a written statement. ""We are deeply saddened and shocked by this tragic loss. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Nick's family, friends, loved ones and fans."" One person was arrested in connection with the three-vehicle accident, which occurred about 12:23 a.m. Thursday in Fullerton, south of Los Angeles. Witnesses say a red minivan ran a red light and struck two vehicles at an intersection, police Lt. Craig Brower said. One of the vehicles, a gray Mitsubishi, slammed into a power pole, Brower said. Two of its passengers were declared dead at the scene, he said. The other two were transported to UC Irvine Medical Center. Murray said Adenhart underwent surgery and died at the hospital but did not know whether he died during or after the procedure. Brower said the remaining passenger was in critical condition. The Angels said the two dead at the scene were the female driver of the Mitsubishi and another male. No other members of the Angels organization were involved, the team said. Adenhart reportedly was ""in bad condition at the scene,"" team spokesman Tim Mead said, and there wasn't much that could be done for him at the hospital. He died ""mid- to late morning,"" Mead said. A passenger in the minivan was taken to a hospital with minor injuries, Brower said. The third vehicle sustained minor damage, and its driver was unhurt, he said. Police did not identify any of the dead. The minivan's driver fled the scene and was later arrested, Brower said. Andrew Thomas Gallo, 22, of Riverside will face charges of manslaughter, felony driving under the influence and hit-and-run, he said. Footage from the scene showed the minivan with a smashed front end and the Mitsubishi, which was heavily damaged. Debris littered the intersection where the crash took place, and it was cordoned off with yellow police tape. The Angels' game Thursday night with the Oakland A's was postponed at the direction of Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig. No information was released as to when the game would be played. ""Major League Baseball is in mourning today upon the news of this tragedy that has taken Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart and two others,"" Selig said in a statement. ""Nick was just 22 years of age, with a wonderful life and career ahead of him. On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my sincere sympathy to the families and friends of all three victims and to the entire Angels' organization. I send my deepest condolences to Nick's parents, Jim and Janet. The hearts of everyone in baseball are with them at this most difficult time."" The Angels quoted Adenhart's family in the team statement, saying they express ""sincere gratitude for all the help the Angels have provided."" ""He lived his dream and was blessed to be part of an organization comprised of such warm, caring and compassionate people,"" Adenhart's parents said. ""The Angels were his extended family. Thanks to all of Nick's loyal supporters and fans throughout his career. He will always be in everyone's hearts forever."" Funeral and memorial arrangements were pending, the team said. Adenhart pitched in a game against the Oakland A's on Wednesday night in Anaheim, California, making a ""brilliant effort"" despite the Angels' 6-4 loss, according to MLB.com. In his fourth major league start, Adenhart pitched a scoreless six innings, with seven hits, three walks and five strikeouts. ""I thought he pitched a terrific game,"" manager Mike Scioscia told MLB.com after the game. ""He gave us a chance to win. He has better tools out there now. He pitched ahead a lot and was able to get back in counts and put guys away."" ""It felt good to work out of some jams early,"" Adenhart told MLB.com. ""My curveball was really working for me, and then my change came on later when I felt I needed it."" Jim Adenhart had flown out from Baltimore, Maryland, and was at Wednesday night's game to watch his son's start, his first of the season, Mead said. He remained in California on Thursday, and Janet Adenhart was expected to fly out later in the day. The Angels drafted Adenhart in the 14th round of the June 2004 draft, according to the team statement. He was in his fifth professional season and made the Angels' Opening Day roster for the first time. ""Adenhart earned his spot in the Angels rotation via a spring training in which he recorded a 3-0 record and a 3.12 ERA over the course of six starts,"" the team statement said. ""During that span, he struck out 18 while allowing only five base on balls."" Adenhart made his major league debut May 1 against Oakland, the team said. At the time, he was the youngest active-roster pitcher in the majors. Adenhart was a 2004 graduate of Williamsport High School in Williamsport, Maryland. His baseball coach there, Rod Steiner, told CNN affiliate WHAG, ""After watching last night, as well as he pitched ... things seemed to be going so smooth. This is the last thing that you ever imagine."" He remembered Adenhart as a hard worker who knew he wanted to be a major-league pitcher while still in high school and worked hard to achieve that goal, despite a setback when he had to undergo shoulder surgery. He said area residents who didn't even know Adenhart followed his career and cheered him on. ""He touched a lot of lives.""

"(CNN) -- Nearly one-fifth of American 4-year-olds are obese, and children of color are at higher risk, according to new research. Obese children are at risk for early onset of diabetes, fatty liver and musculoskeletal problems. Researchers calculated the body mass index from a sample of 8,550 Hispanic, black, white, Asian and Native American 4-year-olds. The children were born in 2001, and in 2005, their height and weight were measured -- 18.4 percent of them were obese. ""Significant differences in the prevalence of obesity between racial/ethnic groups were evident at 4 years of age,"" the researchers wrote in the April issue of the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine. Using body mass index, they found that 31.2 percent of American Indian/Native Alaskans, 22 percent of Hispanics, 20.8 percent of blacks, 15.9 percent of whites and 12.8 percent of Asians were obese. ""It's surprising that there are large differences by racial/ethnic group by that age,"" said Sarah Anderson, an assistant professor of epidemiology at The Ohio State University and lead study author. Anderson and co-author Robert Whitaker's analysis showed that children were becoming obese even before encountering soda and candy vending machines in schools. ""These results really do point to the need for us to focus attention on early childhood and the need for research to understand how these differences can emerge so early,"" Anderson said. ""To do that, we may need to understand the different family and cultural factors that are at play in these children's lives."" The cause for the early health disparities is hard to pinpoint, childhood obesity experts said. ""It's always possible there are biological factors within ethnic groups,"" said Dr. Tom Robinson, director of the Center for Healthy Weight at the Stanford University School of Medicine. ""We know most of the changes that have occurred in body fat tend to occur from being in an environment that promotes very easy access to high-caloric foods and limited opportunities for physical activities."" Michael Rich, an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, called the disparities between ethnic groups disturbing. ""The expectations, lifestyle, behaviors are different on a cultural and socioeconomic basis,"" he said. ""Kids who live in the inner city, whose neighborhoods are perceived as dangerous, stay at home more, sit more, eat more snacks, because that's all they can get at the local bodega. There are no supermarkets to get produce. That's what mom is eating, so that's what kid is eating. What we're dealing with here is whole life issues."" Previous research has shown that older children are becoming less active and spending more time in front of a computer or TV. ""That is displacing physical activity,"" said Dr. Sarah Barlow, director of the Obesity Center at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. ""You can imagine strollers, less outdoor play -- all those kinds of things that have shifted how much activity younger kids are getting. At the same time, portion sizes are increasing for everybody."" According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, adults fare no better. Approximately 45 percent of blacks, 36.8 percent of Mexican Americans and 30 percent of whites are obese. ""It's a very bad sign if we see obesity at a young age,"" Robinson said. ""When we see children obese at age 4, we're likely to see complications -- high blood pressure, abnormal lipids -- which can lead to heart disease and stroke, diabetes in children."" Diseases commonly seen in 40- or 50-year-olds are presenting in 6- and 7-year-olds. Obese children are developing type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease and musculoskeletal problems, which occur because their bodies can't carry that much weight, doctors said.  Calculate your child's body mass index. ""The heavier you are as a child, the likelier that extra weight will follow you through life,"" Robinson said. ""That's why we see adolescents who need weight-loss surgery, because they have life-threatening complications from obesity."" If you have an obese child... The first step is for the parents to acknowledge that the child is overweight, instead of making excuses or comparing him or her to heavier children. Many of the parents of obese children are overweight themselves, which makes that acknowledgment difficult, said Rich, who is also director of the Center on Media and Child Health at Children's Hospital in Boston. ""While it's important to focus on it and take it seriously, it's also important not to give up or feel hopeless,"" he said. ""Then you won't try. You want to look at it for what it is and not be defeated by it."" When you're trying to help your child achieve a healthy weight, remove the stigma attached to obesity. ""It should always be about health, not about losing weight,"" Rich said. ""You're trying to build the positive."" He recommended the 5-2-1-0 plan. Eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables, cut screen time down to two hours or less, exercise at least one hour, and have zero soda and sugary drinks. Such changes, which are not seismic shifts to lifestyles, can help the child get into a health weight. ""It's easier to start that way, rather than try to change habits when they're 8 or 12 or 16,"" said Barlow, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. While it's possible for some kids to outgrow the excess weight, she warned parents not to count on that. ""We've seen over time that the environment doesn't promote that,"" she said.","Research: 18.4 percent of 4-year-olds in the United States are obese.

"NORFOLK, Virginia (CNN) -- Negotiators aboard a U.S. Navy warship are trying to secure the release of an American freighter captain who is being held by pirates on a lifeboat off the coast of Somalia, according to Maersk Line Ltd. Capt. Richard Phillips of the Maersk Alabama is being held by pirates on a lifeboat off Somalia. The crew aboard the destroyer USS Bainbridge could see the lifeboat where pirates have been holding Capt. Richard Phillips since Wednesday, the company said in a written statement issued at 5 p.m. ET. Phillips has not been hurt, the statement said. Phillips, who has received provisions and batteries for his radio, has been in touch with the crews of the Alabama and the Bainbridge, the statement said. The pirates are the same four men who hijacked Phillips' vessel, the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama, early Wednesday hundreds of miles off the Horn of Africa. The Alabama's 20-person crew later regained control of the ship, which is owned and operated by the Norfolk-based Maersk Line Ltd. In a written statement, Maersk spokesman Kevin Speers noted that ""there have been many questions about how the crew re-captured the ship and how the captain came to leave the ship."" But he would not clarify the matter. ""Our immediate focus has been to bring the current situation to a safe resolution,"" he said. ""There will be time for due diligence and retrospective review once we have the safe return of all parties and the opportunity for a full de-briefing."" The U.S. Navy, which is in charge of the situation, requested the help of the FBI. FBI negotiators in the United States are in touch with the crew of the Bainbridge, which arrived on the scene earlier Thursday to assist, a senior U.S. defense official said. According to Maersk's last communication with the Navy, the 28-foot lifeboat was disabled and ""dead in the water,"" Speers said Thursday morning. ""We are encouraged that most of the crew is safe. They have been resilient and courageous throughout this crisis,"" Speers said.

"MacDILL AIR FORCE BASE, Florida (CNN) -- No piece of equipment is more crucial to a soldier in the field than his rifle. And America's most elite troops are about to get a new series of rifles designed for their unique and dangerous missions. CNN was given an exclusive look at two new rifles for an elite group of U.S. troops. ""The difference is, I'm gonna have a weapon that's gonna fit the situation,"" an Army Ranger staff sergeant said. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) is about to start training its SEALs, Green Berets and other Special Operations troops in the use of Mark 16 and Mark 17 rifles. Within a year, the new rifles should be in action against terrorists and insurgents in Iraq, Afghanistan and hot spots the public may never hear about. The usually secretive SOCOM gave CNN an exclusive chance to see and even fire the new weapon recently at its headquarters near Tampa, Florida.  Watch a preview of the new weapons » . The contractors working with SOCOM to develop the weapon say it is more versatile and more accurate, jams less and lasts longer than the current rifle used by many Special Operations troops, the M-4. The Mark 16 (Mk16) fires a 5.56 mm round, the same size used for decades in M-16s and M-4s. The Mk17 fires a larger 7.62 mm round that is used in some U.S. military machine guns, but it's not the same round as in the AK-47, the world's most widely used assault rifle. Both of the new rifles are designed to kill regardless of the situation. ""Whether that's a soft target, a guy without body armor, or whether that's an enemy force within a vehicle that you need to shoot through a window or the side of the vehicle and you want to ensure that round is not deflected,"" said Tucker Campion, a retired Navy SEAL who now is a civilian contractor working on the new rifles. ""We want a round that, when it hits the enemy soldier, provides the maximum amount of damage."" Even though they fire different-size bullets, each rifle is largely interchangeable with the other. By changing only a few parts, including the bolt and the barrel, a soldier can switch from a gun that fires the lighter 5.56 mm round to one that shoots the heavier 7.62 mm round in a matter of minutes. That's just one example of the rifle's versatility. Each gun comes with three interchangeable barrels, and each gives the troops a specific advantage. ""If you were going to clear an urban environment, buildings, rooms, you'd probably throw the short barrel on there,"" the staff sergeant said. CNN is honoring the Ranger's request not to identify him, because in battle, anonymity is crucial for Special Operations troops. ""If you're in Afghanistan and you're walking in the mountains and the hills and all that, and your distance is going to be a lot greater to the enemy, and you're probably going to want to throw the longer barrel on there so you get that extra reach,"" the Ranger said. Even though the rifles fire the same bullets as existing weapons, they are designed to be much more accurate. ""If you look at a current inventory assault rifle, you get 350 to 400 meters,"" Campion said of their range of accuracy. ""Put a long barrel in (the new rifle), and now you're at 6 to 7 (hundred meters). So we're extending the standoff between us and the enemy."" A longer standoff means an American can shoot an enemy soldier from farther away; thus, the American is safer. One of the main goals was to design a gun that lasts longer. Campion says the M-4 is designed to fire 6,000 rounds over five years. But the Mk16 and Mk17 were designed for Special Operations, who are likely to fire 6,000 rounds in less than one year. The new rifles are designed to handle the greater rate of use and last twice as long. The design changes that make the Mk16 and Mk17 last longer also make them more reliable. Nothing is worse for a GI in battle than for his rifle to jam at the wrong moment, but it happens with all kinds of guns. These new rifles are designed to reduce those jamming problems as much as possible. The new rifle also comes in a Mk13 model, which includes a grenade launcher mounted below the barrel. To those who will use the rifles in the field, what they need first and foremost from the new weapons is success.

"Editor's note: José Miguel Vivanco is executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit organization that seeks to protect people's rights. A lawyer from Chile, he was educated there, in Spain and at Harvard Law School. José Miguel Vivanco says conviction of Peru's ex-president is a warning to those who deny human rights. (CNN) -- Peruvians are celebrating an extraordinary victory this week: the conviction of their former president, Alberto Fujimori, for death squad killings carried out during his rule in the 1990s. The Peruvian Supreme Court found him guilty of egregious human rights abuses, including the massacre of innocent civilians, and sentenced him to 25 years in prison -- a stiff message to other leaders that justice can eventually catch up to even the most powerful. It is one of the first times a nation's own independent courts have convicted a former leader for such serious human rights crimes and it sets an important precedent for a region that suffered so much from political violence and rights violations. Equally significant, the ruling came after a lengthy televised trial, which was clearly fair to the defendant -- despite Peru's previous history of authoritarianism and weak rule of law. Fujimori came to office in 1990 on the promise of crushing a vicious Maoist insurgency but, in the process of restoring order, he corrupted and weakened Peru's most vital government institutions -- including parliament, the courts and law enforcement. Just a few years ago, Fujimori had near-total control of Peru's judiciary. For a decade, his government used bribery, extortion, and intimidation to concentrate power in the presidency, subverting the democratic process and eliminating normal checks by the judiciary, legislature, and media on government abuses. He led Peru from 1990 to 2000, presiding over the war with the Shining Path guerrillas and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. He was convicted of authorizing killings and kidnappings by paramilitary death squads. Fujimori is to be tried separately on multiple corruption charges. The landmark decision fits within a global trend of increasing accountability for former heads of state. Just 20 years ago, it was exceedingly rare for even the most brutal leaders to be brought to book. In the late 20th century, Mao Zedong, Idi Amin, Milton Obote, Ferdinand Marcos, Anastasio Somoza, Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier and Mobutu Sese Seko, to name just a few, were never brought to trial. Since then, however, the tide has turned. In October 1998, London police arrested General Augusto Pinochet on a warrant from a Spanish judge for human rights crimes. The arrest and the subsequent decisions by the British House of Lords to reject Pinochet's claim of immunity were a wake-up call to tyrants everywhere, but more important, they gave hope to victims elsewhere that they too could bring their tormentors to justice. In country after country, particularly in Latin America, victims were inspired to challenge the amnesty laws of the 1980s and 1990s that had allowed the perpetrators of atrocities to go unpunished and, often, to remain in power. Thanks to these efforts, former leaders in Argentina, and Uruguay have also faced human rights trials. Pinochet's arrest also strengthened a nascent international movement -- spurred by the killings in Bosnia and Rwanda, and facilitated by the end of the Cold War -- to make certain the worst abuses are punished. After the creation of UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the world established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and serious war crimes when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so. The ICC is now investigating crimes in the Central African Republic, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in March the court indicted President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan on charges of crimes against humanity in Darfur. The Fujimori case stands out, though, because it was Peru's national court system which demonstrated the will, capacity, and independence to try its former president. A second panel of the Supreme Court will now review an appeal by Fujimori. One can hope the second panel will be as transparent and fair as the first. Even after this verdict, impunity for past atrocities continues to be a major problem in Peru and throughout the region. It is likely, however, that yesterday's verdict will help give momentum to efforts currently underway in many Latin American countries to bring other human rights violators to justice. The verdict will also send a powerful message to current heads of state who may be tempted to use abusive tactics to resolve their political problems. As Fujimori discovered yesterday, crimes they may be able to get away with while in power can come back to haunt them years later. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of José Miguel Vivanco.","José Miguel Vivanco: Peruvian court verdict in Fujimori case sends strong message .

"(CNN) -- Three former guerrilla leaders -- who helped command what one activist called ""one of the most brutal rebel movements in modern days"" -- were sentenced Wednesday in Freetown, Sierra Leone, for crimes against humanity. Amputee victims of Sierra Leone's civil war take part in football training at a beach in Freetown. The U.N. Special Court for Sierra Leone found the men guilty in February of crimes that included murder, rape, sexual slavery and forced marriages stemming from a civil war that lasted from March 1991 to January 2002. They were arrested in March 2003, said Peter Anderson, spokesman for the U.N. court. The rebels -- former leaders in the Revolutionary United Front guerrilla movement -- were known for hacking off civilians' hands and feet during the war, which stood out for its viciousness even on a a continent that has suffered many horrific conflicts. Presiding Judge Pierre Boutet of Canada read the sentences. Former Revolutionary United Front ""interim leader"" Issa Hassan Sesay was sentenced to 52 years in prison, former commander Morris Kallon to 40 years, and former chief of security Augustine Gbao to 25 years. Sesay and Kallon had been found guilty on 16 counts, and Gbao was found guilty on 14. The former rebels received credit for the six years each already has served in prison, Anderson told CNN. He said they will be imprisoned in another country, maybe Rwanda, because the prisons in Sierra Leone do not meet the standards of the U.N. court. Kallon was the only one of the three to express sorrow at his sentencing, Anderson said. ""He really had made a genuine expression of remorse,"" which is considered a stronger statement than regret, the court spokesman added. The court noted several mitigating factors at the sentencing, but ""in view of the gravity of the crimes, their impact was limited,"" a statement from the court said. The court noted that the crimes ""were committed upon a massive scale across several districts of Sierra Leone"" and that ""the impact of all these crimes upon the Sierra Leonean society has been enormous."" ""The Chamber concluded that the inherent gravity of the criminal acts for which Sesay, Kallon and Gbao have been convicted is exceptionally high,"" the statement said. Corinne Dufka, a senior researcher in Human Rights Watch's Africa division, had called the verdict ""very significant."" ""The RUF were renowned for leading one of the most brutal rebel movements in modern days. Everyone knows about the signature atrocity of limb amputation, but there was also horrific sexual violence, abductions, use of child soldiers and forced marriages,"" she told CNN by phone from Senegal in West Africa. Eight people have been convicted of war crimes connected with the conflict -- some on the rebels' side and some on the government's. The U.N. Special Court's mandate is to try only ""those who bear greatest responsibility for atrocities committed in Sierra Leone."" The trial of Sesay, Kallon and Gbao lasted nearly five years. The three had pleaded not guilty on all counts. The Special Court cannot impose the death penalty. The Revolutionary United Front seized most of Sierra Leone from the government and fought international and African peacekeepers. International forces retook the capital, Freetown, in 2000. The trial of the three former leaders was the last of three to be held at the Special Court. Former Liberian President Charles Taylor is on trial separately at an international court in The Hague, Netherlands, for his role in the conflict. The prosecution rested in the Taylor case in January after a year of presenting its arguments. Sierra Leone is known for its diamond wealth, but 70 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. The Special Court is an independent tribunal established jointly by the United Nations and the Sierra Leone government. It is mandated to bring to justice those most responsible for atrocities committed in Sierra Leone after November 30, 1996.","Three rebels in Sierra Leone sentenced for crimes against humanity .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British man who has just claimed the world land sailing speed record is now planning to better his speed -- on ice. Greenbird, driven by Briton Richard Jenkins has claimed the land sailing speed record . Using just wind power, Richard Jenkins drove his vehicle, the Greenbird, to 202 km/hour (126 miles/hour) in late March on the dry Lake Ivanpah near the border of California and Nevada in the western United States. Greenbird is a carbon fibre composite craft -- described by the makers on their Web site as ""part airplane, part sailboat and part Formula One car"" -- that uses solid sails to harness the power of the wind. It weighs 600 kg and is able to travel up to four or five times greater than the speed of the wind -- at which point the downward force of the wings increases the craft's weight to nearly a ton. The only metal in the structure is in the wing bearings and the wheel. Jenkins told CNN the record came after the team, which is sponsored by UK-based green electricity company Ecotricity, made gains in all aspects of the vehicle's design. ""It's a real mixture of everything -- all of the margins are so tight you have to make a little gain in every place."" The technologically advanced Greenbird works by using the flow of air over its vertical sail to push it forward. It transfers the side force of wind into downward energy to keep it from taking off -- a similar concept to that used in Formula One race cars. Greenbird's record speed defeated the previous record set by American Bob Schumacher in 1999. Schumacher, in what he described as a ""boat"" called the ""Iron Duck,"" managed 116 miles per hour. View a photo gallery of the successful speed record attempt » . Jenkins told CNN he had been working towards the record for about 10 years and was ecstatic to have managed the feat. ""We had been working on this for a long time. It started when I was at university...so it was great to finally achieve the record."" The 32-year-old said bad weather and attracting sponsorship had been the main challenges in preparing to set the record. ""You have to be very lucky for the weather to be right at the right time. For years I thought we were going to be unlucky."" With the land sailing record under his belt, Jenkins now plans to return to work on his Greenbird ice sailing craft -- which he feels has the potential to be even quicker than the Greenbird land racer. ""Theoretically it should be a lot faster, but currently ice yachts are not as quick as land yachts. We are not completely sure why."" Jenkins said his next ice sailing attempt would likely take place in December this year on Canyon Ferry Lake in Montana, where the ice is large and secure enough for the vehicle. It is also important to make attempts before snow falls on the ice, creating more drag, Jenkins added. Ice sailing is significantly more risky than land sailing, he told CNN. ""Depending on when you go, the ice can be a lot more unstable. There is the risk that you could go through a water-hole into the ice. We try not to think about it,"" Jenkins said.

"Editor's note: CNN's Ed Henry traveled with Barack Obama to Europe on the his first overseas trip as president. President Obama speaks during a news conference after the G-20 summit in London, England, on April 2. ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN)  -- One of the most revealing moments of President Obama's European tour came early in the trip at the close of the G-20 summit in London, England, where expectations were sky high for the new guy. He had just scored some victories on the financial crisis, while also taking some lumps. And now he had to face the media. Pushed by a reporter on why he couldn't get more done, the president was ready with a comeback about how it was far easier for American and British leaders to get their way at summits in years gone by. ""Well, if there's just Roosevelt and Churchill sitting in a room with a brandy, that's a -- that's an easier negotiation,"" the president said to laughter from reporters. ""But that's not the world we live in, and it shouldn't be the world that we live in."" In two simple sentences, the president accomplished a lot. In the first sentence, he made a fair point about how no U.S. president -- Barack Obama or George W. Bush -- can simply wave a magic wand and get the world to follow his lead. And in the second, with the line about how ""it shouldn't be the world that we live in,"" he was trying to send a signal to Europe that he's not planning to bully them. Again and again, Obama said he was here to listen and learn -- not to lecture colleagues such as French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Left unsaid, since it was plain enough to see, was what Obama was really saying: I'm not President Bush. That was clearly Obama's biggest accomplishment on this trip. He was able to effectively press that reset button administration officials have been talking about in order to make the case that traditional U.S. allies should come back into the fold, and it seemed to work. I remember sitting in the front row during a news conference at a palace in France to hear Sarkozy positively gush, ""And it feels really good to be able to work with a U.S. president who wants to change the world and who understands that the world does not boil down to simply American frontiers and borders. And that is a hell of a good piece of news for 2009."" Those are the style points where Obama clearly scored, and not just with European leaders. A new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll found that 79 percent of Americans surveyed feel that Obama has had a ""more positive"" effect on how people in other countries view the U.S. Only 19 percent of those surveyed thought he's had a ""more negative"" effect. The much tougher question is on substance, and whether Obama was able to capitalize on those warm feelings to accomplish what he set out to do before this trip. On that he basically has an incomplete because the early record here in Europe has been mixed. At the London summit, the president pushed for big money to be pumped into the world economy, and the leaders responded with $1.1 trillion. But that money is being directed to the International Monetary Fund to help developing countries, not pumped into the large economies to stimulate growth as U.S. officials had hoped. And Obama was also able to help prevent Sarkozy and others from getting a global supercop to oversee markets across all borders, a bit of a victory in his effort to make sure new regulations do not go too far. Perhaps the biggest victory came on the sidelines of the G-20 and had nothing to do with the financial crisis. Obama had his first face-to-face with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, and they seemed to thaw those recently icy relations. Most important, is the two men agreed to begin intense negotiations to drastically reduce each side's nuclear stockpiles. This could be a dramatic step forward for world peace, so pay close attention to this development. But a cautionary note: There's a lot of heavy lifting left before this becomes a reality, and we may not know until Obama's visit to Moscow in July whether or not this deal has legs. At the NATO summit in France and Germany, the president was hoping to get a boost in resources for the war in Afghanistan. He did get allies to cough up about 5,000 troops, but in the form of police and security trainers -- not combat troops. So with Obama already committing 21,000 more U.S. troops to the mission, this is a very U.S.-heavy effort, something to keep a close eye on in the days ahead. In Prague, Czech Republic, at the European Union summit, Obama delivered a speech about nuclear nonproliferation to more than 20,000 people -- a boisterous crowd reminiscent of the campaign. He even used the old line ""yes we can"" to answer critics who think he can't follow through on ridding the world of nuclear weapons. But the most important moment of that stop in the tour came a few hours before the speech. It was when the infamous 3 a.m. phone call that Hillary Clinton talked about in the campaign finally arrived. Except it came at 4:30 a.m., when spokesman Robert Gibbs woke the president with the news that North Korea had tested a missile. He basically passed the test of his first international crisis (with -- ahem -- Secretary of State Clinton at his side, no less), although so far the administration has gotten nowhere at the United Nations despite a clear case against North Korea. Welcome to the U.N., sir. And finally, in Turkey the president officially began his outreach to try and repair the U.S. image in the Muslim world. Most interesting is that he got personal, alluding to the fact that he grew up in Indonesia and his father was Muslim -- politically risky given that last year he spent so much time having to deny false rumors that he's Muslim. ""The United States has been enriched by Muslim-Americans,"" Obama said. ""Many other Americans have Muslims in their family, or have lived in a Muslim-majority country -- I know, because I am one of them."" The speech was very well-received in this Muslim-majority nation. But it will take far more than one speech to fix tensions flared by everything from the war to Iraq to the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay. In all, that's a hefty agenda to confront in just eight days abroad. It's no surprise then that I've noticed the president has been looking very tired on this trip. One aide told me that Obama was planning to go out for a nice unofficial dinner with first lady Michelle Obama in Prague on Saturday night but it was canceled because they simply needed some sleep. The fatigue has been complicated by the fact that Obama has been battling a nasty cold, telling aides he feels like he's got an ""acorn up my nose"" -- an interesting turn of phrase I had never heard before but seems to mean the president is stuffed up. And that brings me back to that brandy Roosevelt and Churchill shared decades ago. Obama made a legitimate claim about the difficulty of calling the shots in the current global environment, where small and mid-sized countries hold more sway than before. But right now all I can focus on is the brandy itself. After eight long days on the road, and very little sleep, I'm pretty ragged, too. That sounds like a pretty good way to cap things off.","Obama: World's fate no longer decided by Roosevelt and Churchill sitting over brandy .

"(CNN) -- ""Who controls the past controls the future."" President Reagan's former aides say Obama's budget repudiates Reaganomics. It's a line from George Orwell's novel ""1984."" But it could also serve as the rallying cry for two groups battling over President Obama's ambitious domestic agenda -- and the legacy of two former presidents. Critics of Obama's proposed $3.5 trillion federal budget say he's poised to jeopardize the economic gains unleashed by President Reagan. They say he will make the same mistakes that President Lyndon B. Johnson did when he committed massive amounts of federal money to create a slew of anti-poverty programs dubbed ""The Great Society."" ""The Great Society created a lot of programs and wasted a lot of money,"" said Kenneth Khachigian, a former Reagan speechwriter and adviser. ""The biggest war on poverty was the economic boom started by Reagan."" But others like Joseph Califano Jr., Johnson's senior domestic adviser, say the notion that the Great Society was a failure is one of the ""greatest political scams"" in American history. Republican leaders who have labeled Obama's budget proposals socialist are rehashing the rhetoric their predecessors used to attack Great Society programs like Head Start 40 years ago, Califano says. ""I'm hearing the same round of arguments,"" Califano said. ""The Republicans said that if you provide Head Start and preschool education to poor kids, it would 'Sovietize' our kids and be communistic."" 'Failure' of the Great Society . The clash between both points of view centers on Obama's plan for reviving the nation's economy. The Senate and the House of Representatives passed similar versions of Obama's $3.5 trillion budget for 2010 last week. The budget didn't receive a single Republican vote in either chamber. Both chambers will meet after Easter recess to produce a final budget. Even before last week's vote, though, Obama's budget was creating a partisan wedge. Proponents said it would use trillions of dollars to transform education, spark a green industrial revolution and provide health care to all Americans. CNN political analyst David Gergen said Obama's budget ""set forth the most ambitious reform agenda of any president since Lyndon Johnson."" Gergen's comment could be taken as a compliment or a reprimand, depending on one's historical point of view. Craig Shirley, author of ""Reagan's Revolution: The Untold Story of the Campaign That Started It All,"" took it as a warning. His model for reviving the nation is Reagan, who moved ""power from the government to the people"" by cutting taxes and making government less intrusive. Shirley, alluding to an alleged Reagan quip that ""Johnson declared war on poverty and poverty won,"" says out-of-wedlock births, illiteracy and bloated federal programs increased during the Great Society. He says Medicare and Medicaid, two vaunted Great Society programs that provide health care to the poor and elderly, are now virtually bankrupt. ""All evidence says that the Great Society was a failure,"" Shirley said. Khachigian, Reagan's speechwriter, says Obama's budget would also create tension between people who fought their way up the economic ladder and those who did not. Under Obama, the well-off would be ""brought back down through higher taxes and subsidizing benefits for people who have not worked as hard."" Obama's budget is influenced by the president's previous job as a community organizer, Khachigian says. ""You can't have been a community organizer and not have in your mindset that agencies of the government exist to, as Obama said, to 'spread the wealth,' '' Khachigian said. If Obama wants to look at an economic blueprint for lifting the nation out of a nasty recession, he should look at Reagan, Khachigian says. Reagan's tax cuts helped end the deep recession he inherited when he came into office, he said. The economy took off, and everyone benefited. ""I would argue that the biggest war on poverty took place when the economy started booming in 1983,'' Khachigian said. The 'myth' of Reagan's tax cuts . Other analysts had a different take on the legacy of the Reagan Revolution and what it can teach Obama. Will Bunch, author of ""Tear Down This Myth: How the Reagan Legacy Has Distorted Our Politics and Haunts Our Future,'' says Reaganomics is built on a fable. Reagan didn't prove that tax cuts and small government lead to economic growth, because he never consistently did both, he says. Bunch says Reagan did cut taxes in 1981 but raised them in succeeding years. He also expanded the federal government and created a huge national debt. ""His initial 1981 tax cuts went so far that he was actually forced to increase taxes a half-dozen times in the years that followed, something you never hear about,"" Bunch said. Obama would do better to follow the example of Johnson, not Reagan, says Califano, Johnson's senior domestic adviser. He says Johnson's Great Society was designed to give the most vulnerable Americans -- the poor, the elderly, the disabled and racial minorities -- the same opportunities as the affluent. ""The Great Society saw government as providing a hand up, not a handout,"" said Califano, who wrote about his time with the president in ""The Triumph and Tragedy of Lyndon Johnson."" He says the Great Society proved that government wasn't incompetent. Johnson persuaded Congress to pass at least 100 Great Society proposals. Programs awarded college students financial aid, gave struggling families food stamps and gave millions of Americans access to health insurance for the first time. It also reduced poverty, Califano says. About 22 percent of Americans lived below the poverty line when Johnson took office in 1963. By 1970, when the impact of Great Society programs was being felt, the poverty rate dropped to 12.6 percent, Califano says. (The poverty rate in 2007 was 12.5 percent, the U.S. Census Bureau reported.) Califano, who calls Obama's budget a logical extension of the Great Society, says Obama personally benefited from the Great Society ""crown jewel"": the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which ensured African American participation at the polls. ""My God, Obama wouldn't be president if Lyndon Johnson hadn't passed that civil rights law,"" Califano said. ""He would not have gotten the votes to get elected."" Robert Weisbrot, co-author of ""The Liberal Hour: Washington and the Politics of Change in the 1960s,'' says the Great Society also helped lay the foundation for the modern environmental movement with its passage of clean air and water laws. Read why Weisbrot says Obama can't create another Great Society . ""We can find much to celebrate in those years in the 1960s when we see a burst of reform when the government is ready to face problems openly and decisively,"" Weisbrot said. There may be, however, one point of agreement for supporters and critics of Obama's domestic agenda. It was expressed by Khachigian, Reagan's former speechwriter. When asked whether he was miffed that some people were now comparing Obama to Reagan, he said his opposition to Obama's budget was based on something deeper: fear. He says the nation could become a Failed Society if Obama's approach doesn't end a brutal recession. ""It's not a matter of pride but of practicality,"" he said. ""If this doesn't work, we're all in deep doo-doo.""","Clash over Obama's budget centers on America's future, and past .

"BINGHAMTON, New York (CNN) -- Authorities defended the timeliness of police response to Friday's massacre at an upstate New York immigration services center as funerals were set to begin Sunday for two of the 13 slain. Jiverly Wong, 41, has been identified by police as the gunman in the Binghamton, New York, rampage. ""No decisions by the police had any bearing on who died,"" Broome County District Attorney Jerry Mollen told reporters Sunday. The first officers arrived at the American Civic Association about three minutes after the first emergency calls were made Friday, according to a timeline by the Binghamton Police Department. Officers did not enter the building for about 40 minutes, police said. ""No one was shot after police arrival, and none of the people who had been shot could have been saved, even if the police had walked in the door within [the] first minute,"" Mollen said. ""The injuries were that severe."" Police said Jiverly Wong, a 41-year-old Vietnamese immigrant from an ethnic Chinese family, fatally shot his victims and then turned his gun on himself. City officials on Sunday released a list of all the victims. A receptionist at the American Civic Association called 911 at 10:31 a.m. Friday while she hid under her desk, said Binghamton Police Chief Joseph Zikuski. She was shot in the stomach and pretended to be dead before crawling under the desk, he said.  Watch Zikuski give a timeline of the shooting » . Four people, including the receptionist, remained in serious condition in local hospitals but were expected to survive, the chief said. Wong had been taking English classes at the association and was upset about recently losing a job, police said. But officials on Sunday were still trying to determine a motive. Zikuski said the first 911 calls were in ""broken English,"" and dispatchers ""could not determine what was the problem."" But two minutes after the first calls, officers were being dispatched to the civic association, and the first units arrived one minute later, the chief said. He said in these types of situations officers have orders to enter a building if shooting is still happening inside, but in this case the shooting had stopped. At 10:38 a.m., one of the wounded called with a description of the gunman. The department's tactical squad did not move in until 11:13 a.m., Zikuski said. Mollen said the issue of the police response was ""an obvious question"" that will be investigated, but ""now's not the time."" ""We need a lot more information before any reasoned, intelligent response can be given to you,"" he said. Those who knew Wong said they were not surprised by his actions, Zikuski said Saturday. ""Some of this behavior on his [Wong's] part wasn't a total shock,"" the chief said. ""Apparently people were making fun of him. He felt he was being degraded because of his inability to speak English, and he was upset about that,"" Zikuski said. Wong came to the United States in the late 1980s and lived in Binghamton before moving to California in the early 1990s, police said. He returned to Binghamton in July 2007, Zikuski said. Wong became a U.S. citizen in 1995 and married and divorced while living in California, where he had been convicted on a misdemeanor charge of writing bad checks, according to Zikuski. Police found at the center two semi-automatic handguns, a .45-caliber and a 9 mm, licensed to Wong. The guns were purchased locally, and Wong made trips to a firing range ""at least once a week, sometimes more than that,"" Zikuski said. Wong had attempted to purchase ""a number of firearms,"" the chief said. Purchasing a gun in New York takes about two weeks, Zikuski said, and Wong would return to a store during that period, ""cancel that order and purchase another one."" Wong was wearing body armor during the shooting. Investigators are ""looking into that"" because New York limits body armor purchases to law enforcement, Zikuski said. Funerals for two victims were held Sunday afternoon at a local mosque. An interfaith memorial service for all the victims was held Sunday evening, and hundreds of people took part in a candlelight vigil afterward.  Watch relatives remember one of the victims, Roberta ""Bobby"" King » . ""In a strange way, this tragedy has brought everyone together,"" Binghamton Mayor Matthew Ryan said. ""We are a good community, a nonviolent community,"" Ryan said earlier of the city of about 50,000 people about 140 miles northwest of New York City. ""And we are going to spread the word that this is a community that will come together and heal."" More details emerged over the weekend about the shooting. Wong used his car to barricade the center's back door and entered through the front of the building, authorities said. Ryan said the car belonged to Wong's father. Wong lived with his parents in Johnson City, near Binghamton, the site of a law enforcement search Friday. ""They took a computer hard drive -- they took an empty long gun case and some other bags,"" the mayor said. Wong was known to practice target shooting there, acquaintances told state police. Angela Leach, a representative of the American Civic Association, read a statement through tears at a news conference Saturday.  View photos from the scene in Binghamton » . ""Whatever drove this individual to do what he did I cannot possibly fathom,"" Leach said. ""But we will come out of our grief and sadness more resolute in our mission and more dedicated than ever to help people realize the dream of American citizenship."" One of the victims was Omri Yigal's wife, Dolores, Yigal told CNN. A native of the Philippines, she was taking English classes at the center to better herself. Yigal said he had no anger for the shooter. ""My thoughts are on my wife. I don't have time for that now,"" he said. Yigal said he felt ""grief for my wife and that's it."" ""She's come so far,"" he said haltingly. He crossed his arms and his eyes to the ground. ""So much,"" he said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A pair of Republican congressmen ripped Congressional Black Caucus members for ignoring Cuba's ""myriad gross human rights abuses"" Thursday, saying this week's caucus trip to the island nation ignored the plight of political prisoners under the Castro regime. Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, blasts members of the Black Caucus on Thursday for their trip to Cuba. They also urged the Obama administration to refrain from easing trade embargo or travel restrictions until the Cuban government releases all ""prisoners of conscience,"" shows greater respect for freedom of religion and speech, and holds ""free and fair"" elections. The call from Reps. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, and Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, came three days after the administration signaled that new rules on family travel and remittances to Cuba may be announced before President Obama goes to the Summit of the Americas on April 17. It also followed statements from several Black Caucus members Tuesday arguing for consideration of an end to the trade embargo and other diplomatic restrictions placed on Cuba for five decades.  Watch CNN's Ed Hornick discuss the story » . ""Yes, we have history -- we have good history and not-so-good history,"" said Rep. Laura Richardson, D-California. ""But the point is it's history, and we need to move forward."" Three members of the caucus were visiting the Latin American School of Medicine, where students from nations including the United States study, when they received an invitation to Fidel Castro's home for a meeting. ""Former President Fidel Castro is very engaging, very energetic,"" said CBC Chairwoman Barbara Lee, also a from California Democrat. ""Our conclusion is, given the new direction in our foreign policy, that it's time to look at a new direction in our policy toward Cuba.  Watch Lee discuss her visit to Cuba » . ""The 50-year embargo just hasn't worked,"" she said. The caucus members, who also visited current Cuban President Raul Castro, ""did nothing to publicly show any concern for the myriad gross human rights abuses perpetrated by the Cuban government or the tragic fate of hundreds of Cuban democracy and human rights activists,"" Smith said. ""Yet they held press conferences at which they heaped and lavished praise and affection for a government the United States Department of State only six weeks ago called 'totalitarian.' "" A 2008 State Department human rights report cited, among other things, numerous accounts of beatings of Cuban political prisoners, harsh and life- threatening conditions for dissidents, and severe restrictions on freedom of movement and religion, Smith said. ""Over the past 50 years, the Castros and their secret police have been directly responsible for killing thousands of nonviolent, courageous pro-democracy activists and for jailing and torturing tens of thousands of others. And they continue to this day to perpetrate their brutal crimes,"" he said. ""Before the Obama administration even thinks about permitting further travel to Cuba, or altering the trade embargo on Cuba, both the White House and Congress have a moral obligation, a duty, to ensure that the Cuban dictatorship releases all prisoners of conscience, makes substantial progress in respecting freedom of religion, speech and, press and assembly, and holds free and fair elections."" Lee responded Thursday that it made no sense to continue what she characterized as a failed policy. ""Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but by any objective standard our current policy toward Cuba just hasn't worked. Simply put, it's time to open dialogue and discussion with Cuba,"" she said in a statement. ""I am convinced, based on the meetings which were held, that the Cubans do want dialogue, they do want talks, and they do want normal relations with the United States of America. And I believe that it's in the United States' best interest to do that."" On Monday, the White House adviser for the Summit of the Americas, Jeffrey Davidow, refused to be pinned down about when the administration might announce its easing of the restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba. ""I really could not say. But I would not be surprised if it came before the summit,"" he said. ""They're going to happen. I can't tell you exactly when.""

"(CNN) -- ""It's time to talk to Cuba."" Fidel Castro is not in power, but he's still a big part of Cuba. He welcomed the U.S. delegation. That frank assessment from Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California, has resonated loud and clear from the island of Cuba -- 90 miles from the southernmost point of Florida -- to the halls of Congress. For the first time in nearly 50 years, relations between the two nations, which have a history steeped in tension, have seemed to ease a bit. That was apparent this week as a delegation from the Congressional Black Caucus traveled to the communist country on a fact-finding mission, with plans to deliver a report to the White House.  Watch CNN's Ed Hornick discuss the story » . ""Our purpose was to see if there were preconditions on the Cuban side. We heard that there were no preconditions,"" Lee said Wednesday. ""And, in fact, we wanted to find out if they were interested. We have to remember that every country in Latin America, 15 countries, have normal relations with Cuba. ... We're the country which is isolated.""  Watch Lee discuss her visit to Cuba » . But even more significant were the meetings the group had with Cuban President Raúl Castro and with his brother and predecessor, 82-year-old Fidel Castro, a controversial political and social figure. President Obama has said he is in favor of changing the relationship with Cuba. The $410 billion budget Obama signed in March makes it easier for Cuban-Americans to travel to Cuba and to send money to family members on the island. It could also allow the sale of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to Cuba. Three provisions attached to the omnibus spending bill loosened restrictions enacted by former President Bush after he came to office in 2001. Analysts see the lawmakers' trip and Obama's campaign rhetoric as a way for the new administration to start thawing relations with Cuba before the Fifth Summit of the Americas. The summit will bring together the U.S. president and 33 other leaders from the Western Hemisphere in mid-April in Trinidad and Tobago.  Watch more on the lawmakers' meeting » . It's a point that Fidel Castro seemed to hint at. In a letter published Tuesday in the online version of Granma, a state-run Cuban newspaper, Castro wrote that an unnamed caucus member told him ""he was sure that Obama would change Cuba policy but that Cuba should also help him."" ""I value the gesture of this legislative group,"" Fidel Castro wrote. ""The aura of [the Rev. Martin] Luther King is accompanying them. Our press has given broad coverage of their visit. They are exceptional witnesses to the respect that U.S. citizens visiting our homeland always receive."" U.S. citizens are allowed to visit Cuba, an island shrouded in a virtual blackout to the U.S. and other parts of the world, but must apply for special licenses to do so. Though it is illegal, some citizens travel to a country like Mexico or Canada and then into Cuba. Not everyone is eager for change. Cuban-American members of Congress, in particular, have voiced outrage over the easing of relations. Florida Republican Sen. Mel Martinez, who was born in Cuba, doesn't want to see changes to the embargo. ""Having tourists on Cuban beaches is not going to achieve democratic change in Cuba,"" Martinez has said. New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, a Democrat and Cuban-American, said in a recent speech that the Cuban government is ""pure and simple a brutal dictatorship. ... The average Cuban lives on an income of less than a dollar a day."" Fidel Castro led the 1959 revolution that overthrew Cuba's Batista dictatorship. The United States broke diplomatic ties with the nation in 1961. The next year, the U.S. government instituted a trade embargo. Both policies remain in effect.  Interactive: A look at the Fidel Castro's life » . The State Department, per its Web site, officially recognizes the country as ""a totalitarian police state which relies on repressive methods to maintain control. These methods, including intense physical and electronic surveillance of Cubans, are also extended to foreign travelers."" Although Castro was credited with bringing social reforms to Cuba, he has been criticized around the world for oppressing human rights and free speech. Lee said she hopes the meeting in Cuba this week will help open diplomatic channels between the two nations. ""It's time to change our direction in our foreign policy. The president is doing a phenomenal job in the world, reshaping America's image and role in the world,"" she said. ""So we want to make sure that we have the proper information to make recommendations to the president, our secretary of state and our speaker with regard to U.S. policy toward Cuba.""  Interactive: Learn more about Cuba » . Though the current stance of the U.S. government toward Cuba fits well with an older generation of Cuban-Americans who despise Castro, not all are of that mind-set. Namely, members of a younger generation see great benefits of opening trade and direct tourism between the United States and Cuba. Jessica Rodriguez, who owns Cuba de Ayer restaurant in Burtonsville, Maryland, is part of that younger generation looking to change the views of her community. ""I think it would be good to open up some of those doors. I have so many customers who say, 'Oh, I'd like to go to Cuba.' And I say, 'Me too.' "" ""I think it would be great for the world to see Cuba for itself,"" she added. Some Cuban-Americans like Tessie Aral, owner of a Miami, Florida, travel agency that specializes in trips to Cuba, see the financial benefits of lifting the travel ban. ""I think a lot of Americans are going to want to travel to Cuba because it's been the forbidden fruit for so long,"" Aral said. ""For our country to tell us which country we can travel to, I think that's just archaic."" Others in Congress see opening greater relations with Cuba as vital to the United States. A group of senators and other supporters unveiled a bill March 31 to lift the 47-year-old travel ban to Cuba. ""I think that we finally reached a new watermark here on this issue,"" said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-North Dakota, one of the bill's sponsors. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, another sponsor of the bill, issued a draft report in February that said it was time to reconsider the economic sanctions. Lugar is the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Nonetheless, there is more political and diplomatic work to be done before restrictions on travel and trade could be lifted. Though it's a first step, Lee sees it as a crack in the proverbial ceiling. ""We went to Cuba to listen to Cuban officials to make sure that we had the information and the facts that were necessary to bring back and at least let our administration know what we believe is possible.""

"BUZZARDS BAY, Massachusetts (CNN)  -- A crew member aboard a freighter seized by pirates off east  Africa said Wednesday that the crew had captured one of four pirates who hijacked their vessel, but they released him in a failed hostage trade. Shane Murphy is one of the crew members on board the U.S. ship that was hijacked off Somalia's coast. The crew of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama had hoped their release of the pirate would lead the pirates to release Capt. Richard Phillips, but it did not, crew member Ken Quinn told CNN in a satellite telephone call. Instead, the four pirates -- who had scuttled their boat when they boarded the ship armed with AK-47s -- took Phillips with them aboard the ship's 28-foot lifeboat, Quinn said. The crew had earlier overpowered the pirates and forced them off the ship, according to messages from first officer Shane Murphy. Murphy relayed the information in quick phone calls to his wife and father in his home state of Massachusetts -- where his father, Joe Murphy, is a maritime instructor, and his son once lectured about dealing with hostage situations.  Watch Shane Murphy's wife recall the conversation » . Joe Murphy, who teaches at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, said the crew sent a distress signal to which the U.S. Navy responded immediately from almost 200 miles away. The ship had eluded the pirates for more than three hours off the coast of Somalia before being boarded, Joe Murphy said his son reported. After hiding from their attackers, then leading them to believe they were more in command of the situation than they really were, the crew jumped the pirates, capturing one of them, the elder Murphy said his son told him. ""It was by sheer force,"" he said. ""They have no weapons -- it must have been, obviously, that they overpowered them."" He said three other pirates ""had gone into the water."" Pentagon officials confirmed that four hijackers had boarded the Maersk Alabama Wednesday morning, and that one had been in custody. Joe Murphy said his son was in contact with the pirates Wednesday evening, helping negotiate for the release of the captain. He said he can only shake his head at the timing of the attack. Two weeks ago, Shane Murphy visited his father's class to lecture the students on situations like the one he now faces. ""This is a classic example of Murphy's law,"" Joe Murphy said. ""I teach the course, my son goes to sea and he gets captured."" He said that, despite his concerns, he has faith that his son's experience and knowledge will help wrap up the tense situation. ""Hopefully, it's all going to work out,"" he said. ""I think this is going to end as a very positive story.""

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- Reporters, editors and photographers at the Seattle Post-Intelligencer prepared their final contributions to the paper, toasted one another with shots of Wild Turkey and packed up their desks in an ""eerily clean"" newsroom as the final edition of the paper went to the presses Monday night. SeattlePI.com will continue to cover breaking news, Managing Editor Dave McCumber says. The paper -- which was the oldest continually operating business in Seattle -- published its final print edition Tuesday as the P-I makes a transformation into an online-only news outlet. A skeleton crew of 20 to 25 staffers will remain at the new Seattle PI.com while more than 140 staffers will lose their jobs. ""Its been an opportunity to experience your community first-hand,"" staff photographer Meryl Schenker said of her 13 years with the paper. ""You meet people from all walks of life, and that's been a real privilege."" P-I journalists coming into the newsroom Monday morning were told by management that they would ""put the paper to bed for the last time"" that day. Other reporters and photographers on assignment when the news broke received texts about it from their colleagues. The P-I is the largest paper to go under in an economic climate where newspapers are facing a steep drop in advertising revenues and readership. At the same time, newspapers are also forced to compete with Web sites that republish news stories but do not share the costs of producing them. Last month, the Rocky Mountain News in Denver, Colorado, published its final edition after nearly 150 years. Last October, the Christian Science Monitor also announced that in 2009, it would replace its daily print edition with its Web site. It also offers subscribers weekly print and daily e-mail editions. P-I Publisher Roger Ogelsby said there was no way for the paper to survive in the current environment. See the final front page . ""It was a combination of time and really rotten economic conditions that caught up with us,"" Ogelsby said. The announcement came a little more than two months after Hearst Corp. which owns the paper, announced that it would either sell the P-I or close it. For months, the paper's staff prayed a buyer would come through while covering the city and the drama surrounding their own future. ""There's some relief in knowing,"" Managing Editor David McCumber said. ""And some excitement about SeattlePI.com. We'll be the first paper to go online only. So I am glad the globe will keep spinning on the roof and there will still be a P-I in Seattle even if it will be online only."" The Web site will solicit contributions from the community, link to other sites and continue to cover breaking news, McCumber said. iReport.com: Are you a newspaper person? ""We want to engage as many people in the community as possible with the Web site. It's going to be different, there's no question,"" he said. P-I staffers who lost their jobs and those who remained said that in its new form, the P-I will no longer be able to cover Seattle with the same depth and resources it once had.   Watch as staff puts out the final print edition » . ""I wrote about the port of Seattle. Looked at some of the ways the port was mismanaging public dollars,"" said investigative reporter Ruth Teichroeb, who lost her job after 11 years with the paper. ""I've looked at vulnerable adults who were being mistreated in group homes across the state. I have written about children at a state school for the deaf who were mistreated for decades. Those are the kinds of stories that the city is losing now."" The P-I's rival, the Seattle Times, will still publish a daily newspaper, but that paper also has been plagued with financial difficulties, prompting some Seattleites to worry that they may soon live in a no-newspaper town. Under a joint operating agreement, the Times and P-I shared production costs while remaining editorially independent. That competition was good for both papers, P-I columnist Mike Lewis said.  Watch more on the end of the final print edition » . ""You lose two things. You specifically lose all the stories the P-I might be doing, but you also lose a competitive news environment. It makes us a lot sharper, and it certainly has made them a lot sharper."" David Lonay, a subscriber since 1950, told CNN affiliate KIRO he'll miss the morning ritual of picking up the paper. ""The first thing I do every day is get the P-I and read it,"" Lonay said, according to KIRO. ""I really feel like an old friend is dying."" Sitting in a downtown cafe near the P-I, Jesse Stewart said he doesn't read either local paper because of the environmental issues involved with producing newspapers and the convenience factor of reading news online.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It is news that will be greeted with despair and joy in equal measure in family homes across the globe -- Computer games might be good for children. According to scientists at Brunel University in West London, ""young people can experience huge benefits from participating in multi player online role playing games"". Children playing online games have their imaginations stimulated, not stunted. On the one hand, parents will be pleased to learn that their offspring aren't wasting their time as they sit boggle-eyed in front of a computer screen, and may actually be learning important life skills needed in adulthood. But on the other, it's just another excuse for their children to spend hour upon hour locked away in their bedroom neglecting school studies and family duties. Still, there's always the off switch. Dr Simon Bradford and Nic Crowe of Brunel University's School of Sport and Education have just completed a three-year study of 13-16 year olds playing Runescape -- a massively popular online with over nine million members worldwide. The findings are in contrast to ongoing criticism that children are spending too much time indoors -- either voluntarily watching television and playing computer games or at the request of concerned parents afraid to let them play in the street or in parks, where they could be the victim or a perpetrator of crime. This so-called ""bedroom culture"" is, it is often argued, creating a generation of monosyllabic, culturally illiterate group of youngsters who are ill-prepared for the impending roles and responsibilities of adulthood. Researchers have found that far from constricting young people's imagination, Runescape and similar multiplayer virtual games enhance brain activity. They offer an opportunity to experiment with different identities such as gender, race or ability. Gamers can also benefit from opportunities that they may not have access to in the real world. ""Virtual environments, like Runescape,"" says Nic Crowe, ""form important new leisure spaces for the many young people who occupy them. In the real world, where streets or town centers have become inaccessible to many young people or are considered risky by them or their parents, it is not surprising that virtual public space has become increasingly attractive as a leisure setting."" Runescape is one of the most popular multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) and attracts all age groups, but is particularly popular with teenagers. Players can explore a virtual world which takes its inspiration from children's fantasy games and books -- think Dungeons and Dragons and JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings -- incorporating dungeons, vast landscapes, forests and towns, with monsters to slay, quests to complete and treasure to find. The Runescape website describes the game as ""an evolving world of remarkable depth and flexibility"". ""Our research"", says Nic Crowe, ""explored how Runescape's appeal lay in the provision of an environment in which young people can experiment (symbolically) with the cultural institutions and structures of the material world -- a space in which young people can establish their presence, identity and meaning in ways that might not be accessible or permissible in their everyday lives."" Runescape isn't just about combat. If you don't want to fight the monsters you can take on the role of a craftsman providing the tools of battle. Players can also trade goods and services and build up skills through interaction with other characters. The study revealed that many of the players were entrepreneurial, engaging in business deals online. Dr Simon Bradford says ""At a time when emerging technologies such as the Internet, and computer games in particular, continue to be subject to suspicion and concern, it is important that we also recognize the benefits of what is an increasingly popular and important activity for our young people."" The Brunel University research findings follow hot on the heels of claims by computer giant IBM that online games are helping to groom future business leaders. Multiplayer online games are teaching children the core skills which are required to lead a team. Online games like Runescape, World of Warcraft and Everquest allow players to join forces and work in closely-knit teams to achieve a goal that may take hours or sometimes weeks to complete. With the help of Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Seriosity (a company who specialize in computer work solutions) IBM's research paper ""Virtual Worlds, Real Leaders"" suggests that MMORPG's can train leaders to deal with motivational, social and emotional needs of their team. ""If you want to see what business leadership may look like in three to five years, look at what is happening in online games,"" says Byron Reeves, professor of communication at Stanford University. According to IBM, online games also give leaders the freedom to fail and to experiment with different approaches which, they say, is something that any Fortune 500 company that hopes to innovate needs to understand.

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Japan's Prime Minister Taro Aso announced a historic ¥15 trillion ($150 billion) stimulus package Friday aimed to turn around the recession in the world's second largest economy. Japan's Prime Minister Taro Aso has announced a $150 billion stimulus package. Steeped in a recession, with a surge in bankruptcies and sentiment among its largest manufacturers at a record low, Japan has seen unemployment reach a three-year high. The stimulus plan is meant to keep Japan's economy from cracking open, coalition party officials told CNN. It is the biggest-ever supplemental budget to boost the ailing economy. Japan has been hit hard by the global financial slump. Although Japanese banks were spared the brunt of the credit crisis, the drop in exports to the United States has sent the country into its worst recession since World War II. Aso needs the package to boost Japan's economy and his government's popularity. ""This could help save his life as prime minister,"" said Satoru Ogasawara, a Tokyo-based economist for Credit Suisse. The Aso administration's approval rating fell below 10 percent two months ago, but has been buoyed by the stimulus package and the recent North Korea rocket launch, Ogasawara said. If approved, the package could add two points to the country's gross domestic product, Ogasawara said. But its long-term impact remains an open question. ""It will help the economy from collapsing from this point ... [but] unless the package improves productivity or increases demand, it will be a short-term fix,"" Ogasawara said. Jesper Koll, president and chief executive of TRJ Tantallon Research Japan, said the stimulus package was unlike the ¥12 trillion injections into the economy in the past eight months. ""This is the first designed with real business input, and that's reflected in the package,"" he said, referring to a series of meetings Aso held with business leaders last month. ""That's outside the normal technocratic, bureaucratic fix. ... It isn't just pork-barrel money for the boys."" Koll cites details of the plan -- such as tax breaks for gift-giving, environmentally friendly cars, or measures to increase employment in health care -- as a step forward. ""This goes way beyond grand-standing fiscal policy. It's very specific. For Japan, that's something,"" he said. Still, Japan now has one of the highest amounts of public debt in the world - a rate which could approach 200 percent of GDP next year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. ""The government has since spent billions and billions of dollars to support the economy,"" Kirby Daley, a strategist for brokerage Newedge, said. ""Japan has been trying this and has now gone into almost two lost decades and will likely enter a third lost decade if they continue down this policy path. It has not worked in Japan. It will not work again."" Among the package's highlights: . -- ¥1.9 trillion for unemployment benefits and the promotion of job sharing. -- ¥3 trillion to boost struggling companies. -- ¥1.6 trillion to promote green initiatives, such as the purchase of environmentally friendly cars and energy-efficient electronics. -- ¥2.6 trillion for infrastructure, such as airport runways, train networks and road extensions. -- ¥1.7 trillion for health and welfare. The proposed stimulus package helped a rally in Japanese stocks this week, with the Nikkei 225 Average briefly breaking the 9000-point level for the first time in three months on Friday morning trading. The Nikkei hit a 26-year record low last month.","Japan announces ¥15 trillion ($150 billion) in extra spending Friday .
