"By . Peter Rugg . Almost 25 years after being videotaped smoking crack with a woman in a hotel room, former Washington D.C. Mayor Marion Barry still insists that he was a victim of an entrenched white power structure. In a new memoir out this week called 'Mayor for Life,' Barry writes about his decades in politics, the stunning fall from grace that has come to define his career, and the people he still holds responsible. A review from the New York Post calls Barry 'the original Rob Ford' and marvels over his insistence that he was set up. In his new book, Marion Barry claims he was the victim of powerful white men who didn't like his challenge to the status quo . Berry was arrested after being caught on tape smoking crack cocaine in 1990 . Barry, who claims he gave city contracts to black business owners that it eventually took up 47 per cent of the city's $2 billion budget, writes that his challenge to the status quo put a target on his back. 'White folks may let you in their country clubs to play golf, invite . you out to dinner, take you out to play tennis, but when it comes to . dividing up the money, that’s a whole ’nother story,' he writes. 'They . didn’t want me creating all of these opportunities for black folks. So . when the FBI set me up at the Vista [Hotel], they were really trying to . kill me. If they killed me, they wouldn’t have to worry about me . anymore.' There are some who would agree. The surveillance video of Barry smoking crack in 1990 led to six months in prison for drug possession charges. And despite the city's own struggles against a sweeping and destructive crack epidemic, but he was released to massive crowds who considered him a hero. He was elected mayor again in 1994. To this day he retains a seat on the D.C. city council. Despite a public disgrace, Barry was elected mayor again in 1994 . Barry said he first experimented with cocaine in the late 1980s when the married then-mayor found himself alone with a woman at a friend's house after a long night of drinking. Barry remembers that after she came back from a third trip to the bathroom she told him: “That’s some good s—. You want some? This makes my p—- hot.” 'At first I hesitated,' Barry writes. 'I had never done anything like . that before. But this woman’s comment excited me. So I was curious. If . cocaine made this woman feel that hot, I wondered how it would make me . feel.' After accidentally blowing cocaine all over on a botched first attempt, Barry finally inhaled the powerful narcotic. 'That was my first time ever trying cocaine, and I felt like I had . ejaculated,' he writes. 'The cocaine was a powerful stimulant that went . straight to my penis. What happened next? I had sex with her.' Barry claims he gave city contracts to black businesses, angering powerful people . That was the first step on the road to the Vista Hotel on Jan. 18, 1990, a day he refers to as 'the war to reclaim Washington for white people.' In his telling, he was set up that day by Rasheeda Moore, a teacher and former model then in her 30s who he had fallen for. He claims she was addicted to cocaine while he remained a casual user hoping to quit entirely. The breaking point between them came when he found her smoking crack in an executive suite at the Grand Hyatt Hotel at an AIDS fundraiser, and proceeded to smash her pipe. He also found five crack rocks in her purse that he tried to flush down the toilet Moore wrestled them away. 'It was like Diana Ross in ‘Lady Sings The Blues,’' he remembers. 'I . wasn’t a violent person. I had never hit a woman in my life, but I had . to smack Rasheeda upside her head and push her down to get her off me. I . told her, ‘Rasheeda, you gots to go now!’' Barry remains active in Washington D.C. politics and holds a seat on the city council . He avoided her for months after. But, he claims, when his enemies discovered she had a bench warrant for failing to appear at a grand jury hearing they used the threat of jail to get her to cooperate. The FBI then 'put her up at the . Vista Hotel, placed cameras in the room, supplied the drugs and told her . what to say. They even babysat her kids.' Once in D.C. she harassed Barry until he finally agreed to meet with her. Though he claims to have arrived at the Vista with a security detail agreeing to meet Moore in the lobby, he was outfoxed when the woman he last saw screaming in a drug-fueled rage told him: 'I just . ordered a bowl of soup, but once I finish that, we can come back . downstairs. Now come on up.' Barry claims a former lover was coerced to set him up by the FBI . Once he went upstairs, his resolve began to weaken. 'I started thinking sexually while sipping my drink,' he writes. 'But . every time I reached to caress her breasts, she pulled away from me. Then she said, ‘Let’s do something.’ That was Rasheeda’s code word for . drug talk.' The rest is history. He was tried on 11 counts of cocaine possession and three coutns of perjury. A racially divided jury hung on all charges except for a misdemeanor count of drug possession and putting Barry behind bars as 'a political prisoner.' His campaign slogan for his successful run at the mayor's office after his release? 'He may not . be perfect, but he’s perfect for DC.'","Barry was caught on tape smoking crack in a D.C. hotel room .

"By . Peter Rugg . Being pistol-whipped during an April robbery may have actually saved the life of Arizona man Jerimiah Willey. After Willey suffered the beating during a robbery, a CT scan of his head revealed a massive and possibly fatal brain tumor. Willey, a Phoenix Circle K manager, recounted the terrifying experience in an interview with Cnn affiliate KTVK. Doctors discovered a massive tumor in Jerimiah Willey's brain after he was pistol-whipped during a robbery . 'He hit me in the head twice. ... and then throughout the whole thing, he was nudging me with the . gun,' Willey said. The resulting injury required eight staples, and the life-saving scan. 'They . said that had this not been found and soon around the time that it was . found, that he probably just would have gone to sleep one night and not . been able to wake up,' said wife Alisha Willey. He is now recovering from the first of what will likely be three brain surgeries. 'It's . our understanding, that because of the size, we believe there's going . to be two more surgeries,' said mother-in-law Rose Gould. Security footage captures a robber beating Circle K manager Willey in an attack that would require 8 staples and a CT scan . He is also undergoing therapy having been left with slurred speech and slight hearing loss. A fund has been established to help pay the family's medical bills. 'It's . hard to be thankful to somebody who was so violent,' said Alisha Willey. 'I'm just very blessed that my husband is still alive and that it . wasn't over that morning.'","Jerimiah Willey required eight staples in his head and a CT scan following the beating .

"By . Peter Rugg . A York woman says she's overjoyed after discovering photos of her late infant son were returned to her by the thief who stole them along with her purse. Patricia Harris, 27, discovered her purse had been stolen at roughly 5:30 p.m. Friday upon returning home with her four children, who range in age from 2 to 6 years old. 'Having to get four children settled is a handful,' she said. 'I . realized I didn't have my purse. When I went back to the car to get it, . it was gone. The memory card was in my purse. I was lost. I cried a . lot.' Devastated mother Patricia Harris begged thieves to return a memory card containing photos of her deceased infant son . Harris said losing the images was like losing her son, Cole, all over again . Inside that purse was a memory card containing the pictures she had of her son, Cole Brady Fogle, who was born on Dec. 10 and died on Feb. 22 of sudden infant death syndrome. Those 500 images were the only copies Harris had. 'It's like I'm losing him all over again,' she described the feeling later. 'I want them back.' She and fiance Michael Fogle, 30, immediately began taping up fliers around the neighborhood with a picture of Cole begging for the return of the memory card. Harris and fiance Michael Fogle put notices all over the neighborhood hoping for the image's safe return . 'And then I just lost it. I wrote a note with black crayon that said 'keep the tablet and phone but please return the memory card. It has pictures of my son. He died on February 22. He was two and a half months old,' she told Local 21 News. She even left her car door unlocked in the hopes that whoever took the purse would return the photos. As she waited, her story made the rounds online, being shard more than 500 times on Facebook to sympathetic readers who wanted to see the photos returned as much as Harris did. 'I just want to get the word out there,' she told The York Daily Record. 'I didn't realize so many people would respond that way.' Then when she was at work the following Monday she got a text from Fogle around 1:30 p.m. telling her the memory card had been returned to the car. Harris said having the photos returned was the happiest she'd been in a long time . It was tucked into her Comcast work badge, which had also been in her purse, and left dangling from the rearview mirror. Both the purse and the other items it held remain missing though Harris recently learned one of her credit cards had been used at a local Turkey Hill. No arrests in the theft have been made. Still, Harris said she got back the only thing that mattered. 'I guess the thief has a potion of a heart,' she told The York Dispatch. 'You just take things and you don't know what you're stealing from someone and what it means for that person or their family.'","Patricia Harris said her purse was stolen out of her car, along with a memory card containing 500 images of her infant son Cole .

"By . Peter Rugg . A group of male Michigan Republicans decided to answer critics of a controversial law requiring women to buy abortion insurance in case of a rape with an image of themselves holding women's fashion magazines. In what progressive groups are calling a poor attempt at humor, state House Republicans Peter Pettalia, Roger Victory, and Ben Glardon posed in the image posted to Twitter. In the picture, the men pose with copies of Glamour and Harper's Bazaar to prove they care about women's concerns. Michigan state House Republicans Peter Pettalia, Roger Victory, and Ben Glardon posed with women's magazines to prove they care about their female constituents . The tweet was posted with the line: 'Don't say we don't understand women.' The response from critics who claim the group has waged a war on women was swift. 'Eat your heart out ladies,' read one sarcastic response from Mother Jones. The controversial law first made headlines during the 2010 fight over health care reform. An amendment from Democrat Rep. Bart Stupak would have blocked Obamacare abortion coverage in favor of requiring people to purchase separate, abortion-only policies. A similar bill was enacted this March by Republican lawmakers. 23 other states have adopted similar policies. Feminist blog Jezebel called the law an 'atrocious' piece of legislation 'which essentially calls on women to plan ahead for their rapes.' The site also noted that Right to life Michigan essentially admitted the law would likely not lower the state's abortion rates though it would force extra financial strain on women.","Politicians accused of 'war on women' after controversial bill .

"By . Peter Rugg . and Daily Mail Reporter . A legal expert claims quizzing potential jurors on their favorite television shows helped lead to one of the most controversial acquittals in California history when Kelly Soo Park was found not guilty in the death of Juliana Redding. In an interview about the case with 48 Hours, jury consultant Lee Meihls revealed the specific personality types she looked for, and how their pop culture tastes were an important part of evaluating their personalities. Meihls said it was important for the defense to find someone who 'it doesn't matter what you say, they're going to start challenging you.' Jury expert Lee Meihls said a person's viewing habits reflected on the kind of juror they'd be . Jurors believed Kelly Soo Park's DNA may have found it's way to the crime scene without her being there . In the case of Kelly Soo Park, they needed quite a few skeptics. Beauty: Juliana Redding was murdered in her Santa Monica apartment in 2008 and DNA from a woman who prosecutors then alleged worked for her ex-boyfriend Dr. Uwaydah was found all over her home and on her neck . Police had discovered her DNA all over the house one-time Maxim model and actress Juliana Redding was killed in, with traces even visible on her throat. Redding was found strangled to death . in her apartment in March 2008, the investigation eventually turned into . a cold case. Park was accused of working as an . enforcer for a Dr Munir Uwaydah, a physician who once dated Miss . Redding. Uwaydah had lavished expensive gifts and trips on Redding and invited her to live in his mansion before she discovered he had a wife and child. She broke off contact, but Uwaydah continued to try and woo her and attempted to establish business deals with her father to keep in contact. 'For most . people, DNA is DNA, and it tells the truth,' Meihls said. 'So we had to . have another story about the DNA. I felt our side of the story made . more sense.' The defense's side of the story was that the DNA may have found it's way there from the scene of Munir's house. He fled the country days after Park's arrest and has never been charged in connection to the murder. Forensic scientists said that finding mingled DNA was possible but extraordinarily unlikely. To determine who was a skeptic, Meihls asked them about their television viewing. Pictured together here on a birthday vacation, Redding discovered Uwaydah was married only hours later . Authorities speculated Park may have been acting as an enforcer for Dr Munir Uwaydah but he left the country without being charged . 'One of (a juror's) favorite shows was 'The Good Wife.' I thought that was perfect,' she said. 'They're working for clients who are probably guilty but giving them the best defense possible.' Not so promising were shows like Criminal Minds or Blue Bloods which stressed forensic evidence. 'I think this was a model jury,' Meihls said.","Kelly Soo Park, 47, was found not guilty of first and second-degree murder .

Kerim Akgul joked: 'The look on his face.... Priceless.' Troyer, who has used a mobility scooter for years though he has full mobility, has publicly struggled with drug and alcohol addiction in the past. Gawker noted that as full cavity searches are performed in separate rooms, it was likely the pic was just Troyer having a joke. However Ross Feinstein, press secretary for TSA, told MailOnline that any screening of Troyer was done in line with normal TSA regulations and procedures. Troyer rose to fame as the evil Mini-Me in the Austin Powers films .

"By . Peter Rugg . Police say Gary Dudek used his position in medical sales to steal $350,000 worth of skin grafts . A medical salesman is accused of using his position as a sales representative to steal more than $350,000 . worth of human skin from a Philadelphia hospital over nearly three . years. Gary Dudek, 54, of Wallingford, has been charged with theft and tampering with records. Dudek worked as a sales representative for Organogenesis, a Massachusetts-based regenerative medicine company, and was in charge of managing the company's accounts for Mercy Hospital's bio-science department as well as supplying the facility with skin grafts. Between November 2011 and July 2013, Dudek used that position to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of skin, authorities said. In his job, Dudek had an 'open purchase order' allowing him to order skin grafts whenever he wanted. But police claim he made several unauthorized purchases and the hospital never received the grafts. He was allegedly captured twice on surveillance video taking the grafts from the hospital to his car. It's possible he made the unauthorized purchases to pocket the sales commission. Dudek declined to comment, asking reporters to contact his attorney, Eugene Tinari, for a statement. Dudek was allegedly captured on hospital security cameras transporting skin grafts to his car . 'If Mercy Hospital has suffered . losses and they can be deemed to be as a result of Mr. Dudek's actions . then perhaps a civil suit could have been initiated,' Tinari said. 'But to take this . into the criminal arena against a man who has been nothing but . hard-working and law-abiding his entire life is a bit draconian, in my . view.'

"By . Peter Rugg . A California designer has filed a copyright infringement suit claiming he's been cheated out of credit and payment for posters he designed for the Spike Lee film 'Oldboy.' This Tuesday, Juan Luis Garcia filed suit in California federal court court claiming he offered Lee and his Forty Acres and a Mule Filmworks production company 'accesss to the the posters, and offered . Defendants the opportunity to use them to market their film, with the . condition precedent that they pay Plaintiff for such use. Defendants . never paid Plaintiff.' Released in . November, the remake of the South Korean cult classic was a box office . bomb and grossed less than $5 million worldwide. Juan Luis Garcia filed suit claiming he offered Spike Lee and his work for Oldboy movie posters but that he wasn't compensated . Oldboy was one of the worst performing film's of Spike Lee's career, bringing in less than $5 million worldwide . Garcia claims to have designed posters for films including 'The Great Gatsby,' '12 Years a Slave,' 'Lincoln,' '42,' and 'Jobs.' His lawsuit notes that the posters were released with tags ';© 2013 Spike Lee,'; and ';© 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks.' 'This copyright attribution is false, as Plaintiff owns these . posters, not anyone else, and the images were not owned or under license . to Defendants,' the complaint reads. 'Moreover, Defendants knew this was false at the time these posters . were created, but continued to reproduce and distribute this false . information.' Beyond copyright infringement, Garcia claims a violation under 17 U.S.C. 1202, which is regarding alleged alteration of copyright management information. Lee claims he never heard of Garcia or agreed to any deal for his work . He wrote an open letter to Lee at the time of the film's release saying he had worked exclusively on the posters for two months only to be offered an extremely low fee from the ad agency, which he then declined. Lee responded to the letter on Twitter: 'I Never Heard Of This Guy Juan Luis Garcia,If He Has A Beef It's Not . With Me.I Did Not Hire Him,Do Not Know Him.Cheap Trick Writing To . Me.YO.'

There were people who told her her time . would be better spent getting off the sofa and putting away the donuts. She doesn't even touch donuts because of a gluten allergy, and exercises with a trainer three times a week. 'I can laugh at those people because [they] believe the stereotype that fat is a simple concept,' Averill, 35, told ABC News. 'It’s foolish. I’m going to help educate you by making this film.' Averill's film has raised $32,862 of its $38,050 Kickstarter goal and she plans to include a mini-documentary on her harassment on the DVD . But it didn't take long for things to escalate from jokes about her eating habits to full-scale harassment. Anonymous people began calling her home with rape and death threats. They ordered pizzas delivered to her home to show they had her address. They called her husband at work and extended their reach to people who appeared in the documentary and backers on Kickstarter. 'I didn't expect it to get this ugly,' she said. A troll even took her video promo for the film, and spliced it with new footage to load on YouTube under the title: 'Cakes: The New Comedy Hit.' That troll's edit was cut with racist, anti-Semitic and violent imagery. Averill tried to get the video removed by filing a complaint for copyright infringement. The troll struck back, sending her a tweet telling her to retract the complaint 'or else.' In a way, all the attacks did was help convince her the project was important. While her own experience with online harassment won't be part of her finished film, she will likely include a short of the battles as a DVD extra. 'I really do feel like we do live in a culture that’s brutally cruel . to fat people of all ages — children and adults alike,' she said. 'If . you’re like me and you’re living in a fat body, no one should be mean to . you.'","Filmmaker Lindsey Averill announced a documentary on body images called 'Fattitude'

"By . Daniel Bates . Being interrupted is so bad for your concentration that even a one minute distraction is enough to completely wipe your short term memory. A study has found that if you are bothered for 60 seconds while trying to focus on something then you will have to start afresh because you can’t recall what you were doing. The researchers said that their findings should be a warning to anyone with a smartphone as users check the devices around 125 times a day. A study has found that if you are bothered for 60 seconds while trying to focus on something then you will have to start afresh because you can¿t recall what you were doing (stock image shown) People who joke about having the memory of a goldfish may have to think again, after scientists have found fish can remember events for up to a fortnight. Canadian researchers trained fish to locate food before removing them from the tank for 12 days. When the fish were later reintroduced, motion-tracking software revealed they could identify the precise location of the food. The study looked at African Cichlids, a popular aquarium species which has previously been shown to demonstrate complex behaviours, including aggression. Working on the assumption they could be capable of advanced memory tasks, each fish was trained to enter a particular zone of an aquarium to be fed, with each training session lasting twenty minutes. After three days, the fish were given a 12-day rest period. They were later reintroduced into their training arena, and their movements recorded with motion-tracking software. And the software revealed the fish returned to the spot where it found food. It shows that humans are more similar to goldfish than they might think as the animals have a memory that lasts just three seconds. The US researchers asked test participants to outline an answer to an exam and then write their response under three conditions. Firstly they had to write uninterrupted, secondly they were disrupted three times whilst writing the outline and thirdly they were interrupted three times whilst writing the answer. During each of the one-minute interruptions, the test subjects had to do maths problems. The findings showed that the breaks caused 95 per cent of people taking part to write poorer quality answers. They also wrote less - for those planning to write a paragraph with five points, they only managed to include three even if they did not realise. The study has been hailed as ‘breaking new ground’ as it is the first to show the impact that distractions have on the quality of work somebody is trying to carry out. Cyrus Foroughi, a doctoral student at George Mason University, Virginia, who led the research, said: ‘One minute is more than enough to wipe your short-term memory. ‘Most interruptions in the real world can last from 10 to 15 minutes to 10 to 15 seconds.’ Dr . Gary Small, a professor of psychiatry at UCLA Semel Institute for . Neuroscience and Human Behaviour, who did not take part in the research, . likened our brains to a computer and said that you have to ‘boot it up’ if you flit between tasks.

"By . Peter Rugg . Called a 'monster' and 'evil,' by those in court, Carnell Petetan Jr. was sentenced to death Thursday in the murder of estranged wife, Kimberly Farr Petetan . It took jurors in Waco's 19th State District Court roughly 225 minutes before returning to the courtroom with a punishment-phase verdict. While they found Petetan was a continuing threat to society, they did not find him exempt from execution on the grounds of mental impairment. Carnell Petetan Jr. was sentenced to death Thursday in the murder of hi estranged wife, Kimberly Farr Petetan . Carnell Petetan, Jr. was convicted of shooting estranged wife Kimberly Farr Petetan to death . As Judge Ralph Strother handed down the death sentence on the 38-year-old Petetan, deputies circled him in the courtroom. When Petetan was asked if there was any reason the sentence should not be imposed, he said it was because he was not guilty, the Waco Tribune reported. During victim impact statements, Kimberly's youngest daughter said Petetan had robbed his family of its most important person' “I don’t think you are dumb,' the 11-year-old girl said. “I just think you are evil.' Oldest son Tyler Farr called him a 'monster.' 'You got what you deserved,' he said. 'The next time I see you will be the last time you’ll see anybody.' He called his mother a good woman who even saw the good in her murderer. The couple met when Kimberly started writing him in prison in 2009 after she had a chance meeting with his brother. Defense attorneys called four expert witnesses in an attempt to prove Carnell Petetan was mentally disabled . Kimberly was a recovering drug addict studying to become a drug abuse counselor, and Carnell's brother believed her story could help his brother. At the time, Carnell was serving 20 years for shooting two men and attacking another with a chair in separate incidents when he was 16. At the time Carnell was serving a 20-year-prison term for three violent assault charges. Through out the trial, Carnell denied having broke into Kimberly's Lake Shore Drive apartment to murder her in September 2012. However two men who rode with him from Port Arthur earlier that day said they witnessed the homicide, as did her daughter. Carnell claimed one of the unidentified men fired the fatal shots himself. Defense attorney Russ Hunt Sr. said the verdict was unsurprising. 'We believe that Carnell is mentally retarded and . we thought the jury may have thought so, too, but not enough to prevent . him from receiving the death penalty,' he said. While an appeal is possible, Hunt said he wants an attorney with a 'fresh set of eyes' to review the case. Carnell Petetan was called 'the most dangerous man' prosecutors had seen in 25 years as they urged jurors to hand down a death sentence . Carnell had just been released from prison a few months prior when he murdered his wife. Even before his assault sentencing, Carnell had been behind bars since the age of 13 when he attacked a teacher. and spent most of his teenage years in a state juvenile facility before graduating to prison. Far from a model prisoner, his early years were marked by the sexual assault of three other inmates as well as attacks on guards and membership in the 357 Graveyard Crips prison gang. 'You have the luxury of knowing how that animal will act inside a cage,' Reyna told them. 'He is a maniacal, evil, deceitful, aggressive killer,' he continued. 'Is he retarded? No. He is just evil.' Renya called him a jungle predator as he urged a death sentence. 'There is absolutely no remorse in the evil heart . that beats in that beast,' he said. 'You are not taking a life. He . forfeited his life through his actions. He earned every bit of that . death penalty.' Defense attorneys argued that regardless of the jury's decision, Carnell would die in prison. Arguing for life in prison, attorney Michelle Tuegel noted that the expert testimony of four witnesses showed that Carnell was retarded and low-functioning, a claim the state had not bothered to refute with a single expert of their own. 'Carnell did not choose to be born with a . disability. He didn’t choose to have a mother who is an enabler and a . father who is an abuser,' she said. Prosecutors noted Petetan's history of violence, including assaults as a juvenile and later being given a 20 year sentence for attacking multiple men . 'Do justice. Love mercy. Go humbly before God,' she said, quoting Micah 6:8. 'Today you have a chance to do something . extraordinary. Will you show mercy? Will you show compassion in the face . of total brokenness?' Davis argued that Carnell Petetan was the most dangerous person he'd seen in 25 years of prosecuting capital murder. Though Davis refrained from advocating for death, he said he knew the advocates for justice would lead the jury to a proper decision. 'We have the death penalty in this state because we do place a high value on human life,' he said. After the verdict was read, Reyna commended the prosecution team. 'Today, Carnell Petetan Jr. received the justice . that was coming to him,' he told reporters 'It was the choices he made . throughout his life and the evil that exists within him that earned him . this death sentence.","Attorneys called Carnell Petetan the 'most dangerous' criminal they'd seen in 25 years .

"By . Daniel Bates . He has a reputation as a Hollywood womaniser, but Jack Nicholson gets more attention from men according to his former lover Anjelica Huston. The Addams Family star said that men were ‘worse than women’ in their efforts to approach Nicholson, whom she dated on and off for 16 years. Huston said men would mob him with cries of ‘Jack! Jack! Jack!’ in the same manner as besotted teenage girls. Lovers: Jack Nicholson (right) gets more attention from men, says his former lover Anjelica Huston (left) Her claims will be surprising for many, as Nicholson is seen as having a largely female fan base. But it also gives an insight into how a legendary Lothario was seen as such a catch that members of his own sex wanted to be with him too. Huston, 63, met Nicholson, 77, in 1973 at a party at his house in Los Angeles, an event which she described as ‘love at first sight for me’. Their affair lasted until 1989, even though he repeatedly cheated on her, but the final straw came when he had a child with actress Rebecca Broussard. In a US TV interview, Huston said that it was hard work keeping Nicholson focused on her with all the admirers around him. She . said: ‘He was the centre of attention and very much the centre of . female attention – and male attention, by the way. Men are worse than . women. Men are: “Jack! Jack! Jack!” ’ Together: Huston, 63, met Nicholson, 77, in 1973 at a party at his house in Los Angeles, an event which she described as 'love at first sight for me'. They are pictured here in New York in 1974 . Scrunching up her face, Huston said that her reaction to this was: ‘What?’ The couple starred alongside each other in the 1982 Italian mob drama Prizzi’s Honour, for which she won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. 'He was the centre of attention and very much the centre of female attention – and male attention, by the way. Men are worse than women. Men are: ""Jack! Jack! Jack!""' Anjelica Huston . Of the public scrutiny of their relationship, she said: ‘It’s a real pain to always have this kind of is she or isn’t she going to be pregnant, it was a lot of pressure on a girl. I did want to have a child and worked very hard at it.’ She spoke candidly about the end of their affair, saying: ‘All of a sudden he was as absent as he’d been present in my life, and that was really hard to take.’ Huston, who went on to marry sculptor Robert Graham until his death in 2008, will write about her relationship with Nicholson in the second part of her autobiography, which is out next year. She told US network CBS: ‘Just so long as I don’t drag him through the thistles I think we’ll be fine.’","Men were 'worse than women' in their efforts to approach Nicholson .

"By . Daniel Bates . Hillary Clinton had a rare moment of bonding with Vladimir Putin over his passion for saving Siberian tigers, she writes in her new memoir published today. The former US Secretary of State said that she was able to get the Russian President to shed his tough guy image by appealing to the animal lover inside of him. He took her to his private office and gave her a lengthy lecture and even invited her husband Bill to tag polar bears in the wilderness with him. Anecdotes: Clinton (at a book signing today) shared the stories of the world leaders she met during her time as Secretary of State . Clinton also inspired Putin to reveal a never-before-heard anecdote about how his mother was mistaken for a dead body and nearly taken away for burial when she was really just sick and unconscious. She talks about both episodes in her book, ‘Hard Choices’, which was released today after being highly anticipated in Washington. The memoir and barrage of interviews Clinton has given is being seen as the first step in her potential run for the Presidency in 2016. Hard Choices covers the major events of her time as Secretary of State between 2009 and 2013 including the Arab Spring, the attack on the US embassy in Benghazi and attempts to find peace in the Middle East. But it also includes offbeat anecdotes about relations between US and Russia, which were ‘reset’ by President Obama in 2009 but fell apart by Russia’s use of energy as a tool of foreign policy and its annexation of Crimea earlier this year. She writes that overall Putin proved to be ‘thin-skinned and autocratic, resenting criticism and eventually cracking down on dissent and debate’. But in meeting at his dacha, or holiday home, outside Moscow the two had a rare moment of solidarity. Clinton knew that one of his passions was wildlife conservation so asked him out of the blue: ‘Tell me what you are doing to save the tigers in Siberia’. Clinton writes: ‘He looked up in surprise. Now I had his attention’. Putin led her down a long corridor to his private office, past dozing guards to a huge map of Russia when he launched into an ‘animated discourse’ in English about the fate of tigers, polar bears and other endangered species. Putin even invited Clinton’s husband Bill to tag polar bears in the countryside in a few weeks time, but in the end the trip did not happen. Cuddly: Hillary Clinton revealed that Putin warmed when she inquired about his conservation efforts - particularly his work to save Siberian tigers. He invited husband Bill on a polar bear-tagging trip . Another moment happened in September 2012 at Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting he hosted in the Russian city of Vladivostok. Clinton mentions she had been to a memorial in the city to the Nazi’s siege between 1941 and 1944 and it ‘struck a chord’ with Putin. He reeled off a story she had never heard before and surprised Russian history experts she consulted afterwards. Clinton writes: ‘During the war Putin’s father came home from the front lines for a short break. ‘When he approached the apartment where he lived with his wife, he saw a pile bodies stacked in the street and men loading them into a waiting flatbed truck. ‘As he drew nearer, he saw a woman’s legs wearing shoes that he recognised as his wife’s. He ran up and demanded his wife’s body. ‘After an argument the man gave in, and Putin’s father took his in his arms and, after examining her, realised she was still alive. ‘He carried her up to their apartment and nursed her back to health. Eight years later, in 1952, their son Vladimir was born’. Relations between Clinton and Putin have taken a very different direction since. He branded her 'weak' and said that it is 'better not to argue with women' last week. Putin was responding to Clinton's comments that he was behaving like Adolf Hitler by sending Russian troops into Eastern Ukraine. In 2010 thousands of secret diplomatic cables sent by the US were published by Wikileaks, revealing embarrassing details of what they really thought about world leaders. Clinton writes that it was a ‘long Thanksgiving holiday’ during which time she made dozens of phone calls to apologise. Clinton also had face to face meetings with some leaders, including Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who she spoke to at a meeting of the Organisation for Cooperation and Development in Kazakhstan. In the cables American diplomats accused him of having a ‘penchant for partying hard meant that he never got sufficient rest’. He is also branded ‘feckless, vain, and ineffective as a modern European leader.’ A wounded Berlusconi, who had suffered his own public indignities over his notorious ‘Bunga Bunga’ parties, told Clinton: ‘Why are you saying these things about me? ‘America has no better friend, you know me, I know your family’. At his request Clinton made a speech in front of TV cameras about the importance of relations between the two countries to smooth things over. Shock: Clinton said that Putin surprised her with the grisly tale of how his sick mother was nearly mistaken as being dead eight years before he was born . She writes: ‘No one wished these words had stayed secret more than I did’. Clinton spent two thousand hours on board her Boeing 757 whilst travelling the globe as part of her job, the equivalent of 87 full days. She describes how the air stewardesses used to buy local foods wherever they went such as smoked salmon from Ireland, but the ‘Air Force’s famous turkey taco sandwich’ was always a favourite. On the long flights the journalists, staff and crew on board amused themselves by celebrating birthdays that took place mid-trip and watching weepy romantic comedies. They also never grew tired of the yellow pyjamas worn by Richard Holbrooke, the former special advisor on Pakistan and Afghanistan, Clinton writes. On one occasion they were watching Breach, a 2007 historical drama about an FBI agent who spied for the Russians in the 1980s and 90s. At one point the main character, played by Robert Hanssen, sparked a wave of laughter when he said: ‘Can’t trust a woman in a pantsuit. Men wear the pants. The world doesn’t need any more Hillary Clintons’. Elsewhere Clinton says that when she was on the road she was warned to leave her Blackberry on her plane and take the battery out to stop it being compromised. She had to put up an opaque tent inside her hotel room to stop hidden cameras from recording what she was reading. Where it was not possible to put up the tent she had to improvise by putting a blanket over her head and reading by torchlight.","Former Secretary of State reveals in memoir Hard Choices how she and the Russian President thawed relations over talk about his work saving Siberian tigers .

"By . Daniel Bates . James Thompson: He died on the same day as the Alps massacre. Now his daughter Joy Martinolich wants his remains to be exhumed . The body of the secret  ex-husband of an Alps massacre victim should be exhumed to find out if he was poisoned, his daughter said yesterday. Joy Martinolich wants the remains of James Thompson to be dug up by the FBI and tested for evidence that he did not die of a heart attack as has long been thought. She also appealed for the French police to contact her family to ‘eliminate my father from the investigation’ and find out who was the target of the mass shooting. Miss Martinolich spoke out after a French detective identified her father as having been married to Iqbal Al-Hilli, 47, between February 1999 and December 2000. Mrs Al-Hilli, a Briton of Iraqi origin, was shot dead on September 5, 2012 along with her  50-year-old husband Saad  Al-Hilli, her mother Suhaila  al-Allaf, 74, and French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45. Their daughters Zainab, seven at the time, and Zeena, who was four, survived the attack, which happened in a forest in the French Alps near Lake Annecy. On the same day, Mr Thompson, a former oil industry worker from Natchez, Mississippi, died aged 60 in the US after slumping at the wheel as he drove home. He suffered from high blood pressure and was said officially to have died from a heart attack. But Benoit Vinnemann, a senior French detective, has raised the possibility that Mrs Al-Hilli’s covert relationship with Mr Thompson may have provided a motive for the murders. And Miss Martinolich, 38, said that in light of the potential link to such a mysterious case, she wants his body examined. She said that no autopsy was carried out on Mr Thompson, meaning questions about potential toxins in his system remain unanswered. Gunned down: Police examine the Al-Hillis' car after the killings. Mrs Al-Hilli, a Briton of Iraqi origin, was shot dead on September 5, 2012 along with her 50-year-old husband Saad  Al-Hilli, her mother Suhaila al-Allaf . Slaughtered: The Al-Hilli family pictured in the French Alps the day before they were killed. There are a range of theories about why the Al-Hillis, of Claygate, Surrey, were targeted . Short-lived: Mr Thompson (pictured) was only married to Iqbal Al-Hilli between February 1999 and December 2000. He died on the same day as the Alps killings . Miss Martinolich said her family might be divided about whether to go forward with the exhumation. Her brother Joshua would probably oppose it and she was not sure about her aunt Judith Weatherly. But she said: ‘I would not have a problem with the exhumation for the simple fact that the corpse there is not my father, it’s just the shell of him. ‘If there is something in his body I would want to know what it is. If the FBI agree, I would comply with it.’ There are a range of theories about why the Al-Hillis, of Claygate, Surrey, were targeted. The family originally came from Iraq, and one theory is that their links to the regime of former dictator Saddam Hussein may be a reason for their murders. There have also been claims that Mr Al-Hilli was involved in a dispute over a family inheritance with his brother Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, of Chessington, Surrey. Victims: Saad Al-Hilli (left) was gunned down along with his wife, mother-in-law and French cyclist Sylvain Mollier (right). There have been claims that Mr Al-Hilli was involved in a dispute over inheritance with his brother . Last year he was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder but then released because of a complete lack of evidence. In . February Eric Devouassoux, 48, a former policeman from the Annecy area, . was also arrested over the killings and spent four days in custody. The . gun collector is still being investigated for arms trafficking, but . there has been no legal action linked to the four murders. Investigators . say that whoever carried out the crime is likely to be a trained . marksman, and to know the local area well. Miss Martinolich said: ‘If . the French police get in contact we will help them in any way. Speaking out: Miss Martinolich said that no autopsy was carried out on Mr Thompson (pictured), meaning questions about potential toxins in his system remain unanswered . ‘Do they even know who was the intended target? It could have been Iqbal. ‘Eliminating my father from the investigation and knowing he had a heart attack would be something we would like to know.’ Miss Martinolich said her father married Iqbal, a dentist, so that she could get a green card and live in the US. In exchange, she bought him a Honda car and fixed his teeth. But she returned to the UK because she was homesick and her family did not want her to marry outside her culture.","Al-Hilli family were gunned down near Lake Annecy, France, in 2012 .

Both Brand and Ross were suspended by the BBC for the incident, with the comedian later resigning from the show in the wake of the scandal. Russell's latest comments come after Justin apologised a second time for video footage showing him making racist remarks. He was forced to make his latest apology after a second video emerged showing Bieber singing his hit song One Less Lonely Girl, but changing the final words to ‘lonely n*****’. The singer, who fans branded ‘an arrogant little twerp’ over the footage, also uses sick lyrics about killing black people and joining the Ku Klux Klan. The 24-second clip follows the release of a video a few days ago in which he asked: ‘Why are black people afraid of chainsaws?’ before imitating the noise of a chainsaw and saying: ‘Run n*****, n*****, n*****, n*****, n*****’. The footage will further jeopardise his career, which has already suffered from a string of run-ins with police in America and his native Canada. Footage: A 14-Year-Old Justin sings 'One Less Lonely N*****', an adaption of his hit 'One Less Lonely Girl' where he talks about murdering a black man and joining the racist KKK . Now he has apologised - once again - for the latest controversial footage. He told The Sun: 'Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I've ever dealt with. 'But I feel now that I need to take responsibility for those mistakes and not let them linger. 'At the end of the day, I just need to step up and own what I did.' He said in a statement: ‘I’m very sorry. I take my friendships with people of all  cultures very seriously and apologise for offending or hurting anyone with my  childish and inexcusable mistake. ‘I was a kid then and I am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again.’ Hairstyle: Bieber had his long floppy fringe style in the controversial video .

Racists: The popstar was reportedly caught on camera changing the lyrics of his song One Less Lonely Girl to sing 'one less lonely n*****' - and joked about joining white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan (file picture) Bieber, 20, who has sold more than 15million albums and earned a reported £80million, blamed the first video, filmed when he was 15, on youthful indiscretion.

Bieber had  realised at the time that making the recording was a . mistake, and had told his mentor, the R’n’B star Usher Raymond, and . actor Will Smith. Mr Raymond rebuked him and showed him videos to . illustrate the evils of racial prejudice, it reported. What's more, TMZ reports that the Young Money Entertainment clan, which features the likes of 'Lil Wayne and Birdman – who Justin regularly hangs out with – are supporting the Never Say Never hitmaker. Mack Maine, President of Young Money, is quoted by the website as saying: 'Bieber does not have a slave mentality.  He treats his people with respect.' Turning to God: As well as his apology, Bieber posted this Bible passage on Wednesday, from the book of John and from Isaiah, both passages relate to forgiveness . The white supremacist Ku Klux Klan lynched hundreds of black people in the southern US. TMZ last night claimed . Bieber had been approached two months ago by a man who wanted £650,000 . for the first video, of the racist joke, but his PR team refused.

"By . Daniel Bates . Some 650,000 people said they wanted Meriam Ibrahim to be freed from her cell where she is eight months pregnant and in shackles with her toddler son Martin next to her. The 27-year-old’s ‘crime’ was to marry a Christian because her father was a Muslim and a judge said she should be worshipping Islam. Meriam Ibrahim, 27, was convicted by a Khartoum court this week of apostasy, or the renunciation of faith, and sentenced to death. Ibrahim is Christian, her husband said. But the court considers her to be Muslim . Daniel Ibrahim (in wheelchair) with his son, Martin after being recently reunited. Martin is being held in a brutal Sudanese jail alongside his heavily pregnant mother, Meriam, who awaits her death sentence for marrying a Christian . Yet in a statement the Sudanese embassy to the US sided with the court and claimed that she was lying about her family raising her as a Christian. In a stinging rebuke, it claimed that it was ‘unwise and dangerous’ to protest about Meriam’s treatment even though it is a breach of Sudan’s constitution. Meriam has been locked up in a notorious women’s prison in Khartoum since September after being charged with adultery and apostasy and given the death sentence. She was also sentenced to 100 lashes as the Sudanese court refused to recognize her 2011 marriage to husband Daniel, a naturalized US citizen from Manchester, New Hampshire. The judge in the case said that because she was born a Muslim she should stay a Muslim. The case has attracted international outrage and the governments of the UK, the US and the Netherlands have all spoken of their concern. But now, as Meriam’s lawyers file an appeal to get her off death row, Amnesty has revealed that its petition to have Meriam released has reached 650,000 signatures. A petition sponsored by Amnesty International has garnered more than 650,000 signatures demanding the release of Meriam Ibrahim (right), pictured here with her husband Daniel. Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher, said: ‘The plight and the bravery of this young pregnant mother has clearly touched the world. ‘More than 650,000 Amnesty International supporters have taken action to call for her immediate and unconditional release. ‘Since Meriam has been sentenced, we are deeply concerned at the conditions of her detention and use of cruel and inhuman forms of restraint. ‘We have received worrying reports that she has been constantly shackled. The Sudanese authorities must guarantee Meriam's safety and release her immediately and unconditionally.’ Such calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears with the Sudanese embassy to the US, however. Its statement it claimed that Meriam’s case was merely a ‘legal issue and not a religious or a political one.' It expressed ‘regret’ at reports of her fate and hit out at those who have ‘mistakenly accused the government of Sudan of violating human rights’. The statement said: ‘The official records of the Government of Sudan indicates that the real name of the lady mentioned in this case as Mariam Ibrahim is actually 'Abrar Elhadi Muhammad Abdallah Abugadeen' and there is no official record shows that her name was changed to Mariam Ibrahim Yahia. ‘Abrar was born in um Shagrah in Algadarif state on Jan. Ist. 1986 to Muslim Sudanese parents and the claim that the mother is an Orthodox Christian from Ethiopia is untrue.’ The statement added that ‘freedom of choice is the cornerstone of both Islam and Christianity’, even though Meriam has effectively been told by a court which religion she must worship. Pressure to help Meriam has also come from two senators who have sent the Secretary of State a second letter demanding that more be done to help Meriam. New Hampshire's Senator Kelly Ayotte and fellow Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri have said they are concerned that the government is wasting time. Earlier this week MailOnline revealed that it was allegedly jealousy and greed which drove Meriam Ibrahim’s own family to file lawsuit against her alleging apostasy and adultery which led to the criminal charges being filed. Her half brother and half sister - who had not seen her for decades - tracked her down so they could get rid of her and take over her successful general store, Meriam’s lawyers alleged. Daniel has only been allowed into the prison once to see his son Martin, 20 months, in what was an emotional reunion.","Petition sponsored by Amnesty International asks the Sudan government to stop the execution of Meriam Ibrahim, 27, who is eight-months pregnant .

"By . Jenny Coad . The great big glass feathers clank heavily when you set them off. 'Aren't they gorgeous?' says chandelier specialist Amanda Holly. They are hypnotic — hanging from the ceiling like giant shards of ice. Lit up they must be quite something. These days everyone can have a show-stopping light at home and there are chandelier reproductions all over the High Street. But if you want something extra special, or a bit of guidance on what will work best, then interiors website rubyinthedust.co.uk is a good place to look for inspiration. Glitzy: One of Amanda's murano glass chandeliers adds character to this room . Amanda, who set up the company, knows how to add glamour to a setting. There is lashings of sparkle in her house, which is filled with crystal-studded mirrors that light up in theatrical style and Seventies' chandeliers. Think of the styling in the film American Hustle, or the glittering decadence of The Great Gatsby, and you get the idea. Amanda sources her lights, furniture and mirrors from the UK and Europe, gives them a thorough clean-up and has them re-wired. Unusual styles: An orange Murano ceiling chandelier (left) and hexagonal glass chandelier (right) Most of the chandeliers are French or Italian. And her favourite projects are for individuals, who want a touch of daring in whichever room, but need some direction. It's a bit like getting a personal stylist to choose the right outfit. 'I ask women how they dress — if they wear a large, statement necklace or are happier with a simple drop pendant — that will give a clue to what they feel comfortable with,' Amanda says. It also depends on what sort of ambience you are aiming for at home — whether you favour a soothing retreat or something more showy. It's important to get a piece as flamboyant as a chandelier right. Textured treasures: There are all sorts of styles available including beaded (left) and flocked (right) Amanda has always been a collector — beginning with her grandmother's jewellery, and moving on to glass. 'The thrill of the find' inspires her to scour markets and fairs year-round. She is a great advocate for injecting nostalgia, stories and a personal touch into our living spaces with antique pieces. 'You wonder who has looked into those mirrors before you,' she ponders. If you live in a flat or suburban semi, there is no need to shy away from a big chandelier. Quite the opposite. A statement piece can create the illusion of space and distract from less interesting features. And you can achieve the look without spending a fortune — with prices starting from £500. Amanda suggests trying a wall-mounted style. She has an example in her dining room — a Triedi Murano chandelier — which cascades like a waterfall down the wall. Contemporary: Vintage chandeliers can look striking even in a sleek, modern setting . You could also try hanging a light over the staircase — where there is plenty of room for the drop. And for low ceilings, she advises flush mounted lights, which won't intrude too much, or pretty crystal wall lights to shimmer in a hallway. Globe pendants work well in Victorian flats with high ceilings, she adds. Some people follow mathematical rules when it comes to proportions (size of chandelier versus height of the room) — but Amanda believes it's best to trust your instinct. Muted colours and minimal style are beginning to go out of fashion, says Amanda. Now the recession is easing, people are starting to spend again, and they want luxury — and even a touch of extravagance. Glittering: If you have a tall enough ceiling, you can go for it with a gigantic, feature chandelier . It's a perfect fit for 'Hollywood Regency', which is how Amanda describes her style. It's a look which harks back to the glamour associated with the film industry — crystals, silks, over-the-top details — combined with classical furniture. The term was originally coined in the 1930s and made popular by celebrities like Joan Crawford and the first lady, Nancy Reagan. The idea is that the home is a display designed for entertaining, while hinting at the personality of the owner. Amanda's lights are not short on character. She has a peacock lamp (complete with real feathers captured between the blue green glass) in her cloakroom. That, as they say in the industry, is a good 'talking point'. No doubt her dinner party guests would agree.

"By . Daniel Bates . Preacher of hate Abu Hamza yesterday told a court yesterday he had just been a spokesman for Yemeni a terrorist group that ended up killing three Britons ‘like Gerry Adams with the IRA’. Hamza said he had no advanced knowledge of the kidnapping of 16 tourists in December 1998 - which ended in a bloodbath when three Britons and an Australian were killed in a firefight. Hamza admitted the prosecution claim that he bought the kidnappers a satellite phone and topped it up with £500 credit. Hiding in plain sight: Abu Hamza, sketched giving testimony earlier this month, was accused by the judge of hiding his terror message behind his religion . But he claimed his motives were dramatically different from those which have been alleged -  because he wanted a peaceful conclusion. Hamza, who at the time was running the Finsbury Park mosque in North London said: ‘To be clear, I was acting like Gerry Adams with the IRA. ‘We couldn’t afford to do anything other than (be) legal and transparent’. The court was shown phone records from December 27 1998, the day before the kidnapping, which revealed that Hamza’s home landline was called three times by the satellite phone. The following day the tourists were ambushed as they drove through the desert in Yemen by members of the fanatical Islamic Army of Aden. Abu Hamza al-Masri facing U.S. terrorism charges, gives testimony in Manhattan federal court in New York in this artist's sketch . Hamza said that he only found out after the fact because he was called by an associate in the UK  - and felt that a ‘can of worms’ had been opened. He told the jury how he thought the terrorists had shown ‘ignorance’ by moving without consulting him. Five hours after the hostage taking - as the tourists were being used as human shields amid a furious gun battle - Hamza spoke to the ringleader Abu Hasan on the satellite phone. Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri in the street outside the closed Finsbury Park Mosque in London . He said: ‘I didn’t argue with him. I said to him I was a bit angry. He said don’t panic, these things happen in Yemen every day. I said this is different’. Hasan told him he wanted to be a martyr but Hamza told him that ‘this is not the platform’ to do so. Hamza issued a press release and gave a press conference at Conway Hall in London to try and put pressure on the Yemeni government not to attempt a rescue. But his efforts were unsuccessful and carnage ensued when the Yemeni army advanced. The terrorists who he had been talking to forced all 16 captives to stand on mounds and fired through their legs during the terrifying ordeal, the court has been told. Hamza, 56, who only has one eye and has stumps for hands, is also accused of trying to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon and trying to facilitate jihad in Afghanistan. He denies all the charges and the trial at Manhattan’s Federal Court, which is in its fifth week, continues.","Hamza said he had no advanced knowledge of the kidnapping of 16 tourists in December 1998 .

"By . Daniel Bates . Chris Christie's political mentor has said he is losing faith in the New Jersey governor over the Bridgegate scandal and that his protegee could be 'finished.' Thomas Kean, himself a former governor of New Jersey, said that he does not know if he will support Christie if he runs for President in 2016 because he is so damaged. In a withering assessment, Kean said that Christie's weakness is that he holds grudges for years and that if you don't obey him he 'makes you feel that your life's going to be very unhappy.' That one of Christie's closest friends could be abandoning him is a deeply worrying sign that his political career is in jeopardy. Losing support: Thomas Kean, himself a former governor of New Jersey, said that he does not know if he will support Chris Christie, pictured, if he runs for President in 2016 because he is so damaged . Christie has been under fire since it emerged that his top aides closed two lanes of the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey and caused traffic chaos to take revenge on the town's Democrat mayor for not supporting him. Christie has always denied he knew what was going on and claimed he was 'blindsided' by the actions of his top lieutenants. But critics have refused to believe this and say he is still not telling the truth. Kean, 78, first met Christie when he was 14 after delivering a speech at his junior high school. Christie told his mum that he wanted to be a politician and so his mum took him to meet Kean, starting a friendship that would span decades. In an interview with the New Yorker, Kean said there were lingering questions about whether Christie 'created an atmosphere in which some of those people thought they were doing his will because they were getting back at people.' Kean said: 'That's possible. If you cross Christie, he'll come back at you, even years later. So his people might have picked up that kind of thing.' New Yorker journalist Ryan Lizza asked: 'What if he did know?' Mentor: Thomas Kean, pictured, was New Jersey governor between 1982 and 2000 and also served as the chairman of the 9/11 Commission which looked into the September 11 2011 terrorist attacks. He and Christie met when Christie was still at high school . Kean said: 'And he's just telling a lie to everybody? Well, then he's finished. As governor, too.' In . the interview Kean said that he and Christie have not spoken since his . re-election night last November because they had fallen out, though he . did not specify why exactly. The . fight brought an end to the friendship which had seen Christie work for . Kean during his gubernatorial election campaigns and become close to . the man the New Yorker calls 'arguably the most important political . figure in Christie’s career.' Kean . was New Jersey governor between 1982 and 2000 and also served as the . chairman of the 9/11 Commission which looked into the September 11 2011 . terrorist attacks. Kean said that Christie's problem is that he 'doesn't always try to persuade you with reason.' He also is hampered by the fact that he 'makes enemies and keeps them,' he said. Kean said: 'He makes you feel that your life's going to be very unhappy if you don't do what he says... '...As long as you're riding high, they'll stay in the weeds, because they don't want to get in your way. 'But you get in trouble, they'll all come out of the weeds, and come at you.' Asked about the 2016 Presidential election, Kean said: 'I haven't decided whether I'm going to support him or not. 'There are a lot of people (candidates) I don’t know that well and I'd like to get to know them better.' Another reason that Kean feels angry at Christie is his treatment of his son Thomas Kean Jr, who is tipped to run for New Jersey governor in 2017. After Christie's re-election he supposedly wanted to remove Kean Jr from his position as New Jersey Senate Minority Leader. The New Yorker claims that with the support of Stephen Sweeney, the Democrat Senate Majority Leader, he 'attempted to engineer a coup' against Kean Jr. During the plot Kean Jr was supposedly summoned to Christie's office where he was told by the governor's chief of staff, Kevin O'Dowd, to step aside. Kean Jr refuse and survived, staying in his post having won the votes of colleagues. His father heard about the plot and called Christie and was told that the governor had nothing to do with it, which appears to be a lie. Upset: Another reason that Kean, right, feels angry at Christie is his treatment of his son Thomas Kean Jr, left, who is tipped to run for New Jersey governor in 2017 . Kean said: 'I thought at some point . the Governor would call me and say: ""Hey, you gotta understand this, I . had to do this for this reason or that reason.""' 'Whatever. But he never called me. The last time I talked to him was Election Night.' The Bridgegate row dates back to September 9th last year when two of the three lanes going to the George Washington Bridge, one of the major arteries into New York City, were closed. Traffic chaos ensued during what was the first week of school. Paramedics said calls took up to three times as long to respond than they should have done. Emergency responders took seven minutes to get to a 91-year-old woman who died at hospital after an ambulance was delayed getting to her. Police were also hampered in their response to finding a missing four-year-old boy and responding to a traffic accident. Meanwhile, among Christie's top aides it all seemed like good sport. In an email apparently ordering the lane closures, Bridget Kelly wrote to David Wildstein, another senior Christie official: 'Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.' He replied: 'Got it.' Kelly was fired by Christie and Wildstein quit in December. A recent poll made clear the effect that the Bridgegate scandal has had on Christie, whose popularity soared after Superstorm Sandy struck America in 2012 due to his strong leadership. The survey found that 45 per cent of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Christie, and 34 per cent have a favorable opinion. In January a YouGov/Huffington Post poll found that just 34 per cent of respondents said they had an unfavorable view of him and 38 per cent had a positive view of him.","Thomas Kean, himself a former governor of New Jersey, said that he does not know if he will support Christie if he runs for President in 2016 because he is so damaged .

"By . Daniel Bates . A woman was dragged along her driveway by five bears after catching them digging through her garbage bins in her garage. The 45-year-old was mauled and clawed but managed to escape and ran back inside her house to her husband. They called 911 and she was taken to hospital with wounds to her head, face, legs and torso. The Florida woman was set upon by five bears (this image is stock) as she went to check on her trash . The attack in Lake Mary, Florida happened just 10 miles from another bear mauling where a woman was jumped upon whilst walking her dogs home. Wildlife officials said that at this time of year bears were more likely to be scavenging for food and that residents should be on the lookout. In the latest incident, Seminole County Sheriff Lt. Pete Brenenstuhl said that the woman, who has not been identified, was set upon by five bears ‘of various sizes’, suggesting it was a family of the animals. He said the bears pounced on her the moment they saw her and ‘dragged her from inside the garage out into her driveway’. The woman was taken to South Seminole Hospital in Longwood for treatment. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission confirmed that it was investigating. Dave Telesco, the head of the wildlife commission's bear management program, said: ‘Now is the time to expect bears to show up looking for food. ‘If they can't find food in your neighborhood, they'll move on.’ In December Susan Chalfant suffered serious head injuries after a bear ‘came out of nowhere’ and jumped on her as she walked with her dogs in Longwood. Deadly: The woman was lucky to survive the attack and fled inside to get help from her husband . It was the worst bear attack ever recorded in Florida and left the 54-year-old covered in blood and with facial injuries that were so bad a neighbour hardly recognised her. She later told wildlife investigators: ‘That bear was trying to kill me. It just kept coming’. In January two Scottish tourists were attacked by a bear whilst on holiday in California after they walked straight past the animal oblivious to its presence. Bob and Irene McKeown did not see the black bear as they exited their daughter’s house even though it was just 10ft away from them. It followed them to their car where it clawed Mr McKeown who had just put his wife in the vehicle. Wildlife officials said that the animal could have been looking for food. Urban sprawl has meant that towns are taking up ever more of the land where bears live - and their numbers are increasing too. In the 1970s an estimated 300 wild black bears were in Florida but that number stood at 3,000 in 2002, the most recent survey. Researchers believe there could be as many as 5,000 now.","Unidentified Florida woman was set upon in her driveway in Lake Mary .

"By . Louise Boyle . Anti-Semitic graffiti has appeared on synagogues and the property of Jewish families in a worrying increase in hate attacks amid the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Swastikas and the word 'Hamas' were found spray-painted on the entrance of the Torah V'Emunah Congregation synagogue in Miami, Florida today. On Saturday, a family in Miami Beach found their two cars with the words 'Jew' and 'Hamas' smeared in cream cheese and pelted with eggs. Scroll down for video . Swastikas and the word Hamas were found spray-painted on to the side of a Jewish synagogue in Miami on Monday in a run of anti-Semitic hate attacks . A Jewish family in Miami Beach had their car smeared with the words Hamas and Jew at the weekend . Josh and Rachel, who did not want to use their last name, told NBC that they did not believe they were singled out but picked because their cars are the first on the block and have a Miami Beach Jewish Community Center sticker. Rachel said: 'It's not necessarily terrorism, but it's like a hate crime. It's clearly racism right here and we thought this is America. It shouldn't be happening to us, but it does.' No one has been arrested so far over the hate crimes. There has been scattered attacks across north America since the ceasefire between Israel and Gaza broke down earlier this month. The 20-day war has killed more than 1,060 Palestinians, mainly civilians, according to Palestinian health officials. Israel has lost 43 soldiers, while two Israeli civilians and a Thai worker in Israel were killed by rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza. JPUpdates . reported last week that anti-Semitic graffiti including a swastika was found in a Toronto bus stop in Canada just days after anti-Muslim . slurs were smeared on an Islamic center. Josh and Rachel from Miami Beach, Florida, who did not use their last names, said that their family's cars were attacked with anti-Semitic graffiti on the Sabbath this weekend . The Anti-Defamation League reported earlier this month that dozens of anti-Israel demonstrations had taken place across the U.S., including one in Los Angeles where Jewish activists were attacked by pro-Palestine supporters. There were no major injuries. Anti-Semitic attacks are also on the rise across Europe. More than 100 hate crimes have been recorded by police and community groups this month in the UK, more than double the usual number. Protesters in France, which has the world’s third largest Jewish population, have attacked synagogues, smashed the windows of Jewish-owned businesses and set others on fire. In Germany an Imam reportedly called on Muslims to murder ‘Zionist Jews’ and Jewish people have been attacked in the street.

Rose Marie Morris, who has two sons, left to go out with friends on July 24 at 5.30pm from her home in Dowagiac, Michigan. She then later left a friend's home at around 11.30pm and hasn't been seen since, Dowagiac police told MailOnline today. Scroll down for video . Rose Marie Morris, who has two sons, disappeared from her home in Dowagiac, Michigan last week . Her family reported her missing to police on Sunday. Ms Morris lives with her mother. Dowagiac Public Safety Director Steven Grinnewald told MailOnline today that the missing woman is not believed to be in a relationship nor have any mental health problems. Police have no reason to believe that the woman is in danger, he said. Limited searches have been taking place, made difficult by the fact that Ms Morris does not have a cell phone or credit card that could be traced.

"By . Louise Boyle . Father-of-six Eric Garner, 43, died on Thursday after being put in a chokehold by police and pinned to the ground on Staten Island . A father-of-six died on Thursday after being put in a chokehold by an NYPD officer. Eric Garner, a 43-year-old who weighed 400lb and suffered from asthma, can be heard repeatedly shouting: 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe' in cellphone footage captured by outraged bystanders. Mr Garner was also pinned to the ground by five other cops, one of whom appeared to slam his head into the concrete. The man, whom officers claimed was illegally selling cigarettes in Staten Island, stopped struggling after less than a minute and appeared to be unconscious. Paramedics were called to the scene outside a beauty supply store in Tompkinsville around 5pm. Mr Garner later died at Richmond University Medical Center following a cardiac arrest. Mr Garner leaves his wife Esaw, six children and two grandchildren. His wife told the Daily News: 'When I kissed my husband this morning, I never thought it would be for the last time.' She said that police gave her little information when she went to hospital to identify her husband's body. Mr Garner allegedly had a history of selling untaxed cigarettes, the Daily News reported. But the deceased's family claimed the . 43-year-old father was simply breaking up a fight on Thursday and had no cigarettes . on him at the time. Scroll down for video . Mr Garner, 43, pictured with an unidentified woman, was trying to break up a fight on Thursday when police arrested him, his family said. Mr Garner later died in hospital following a cardiac arrest . The father-of-six was not armed, according to reports. Garner had a court date scheduled in October for selling untaxed cigarettes and pot possession. His . wife said that he had a history of ill health, including asthma and . diabetes, which made it difficult for him to hold down a job. On a video, obtained by the New York Daily News, Mr Garner is seen sitting outside a store when he is approached by plainclothes officers. Mr Garner can be heard telling the cops: 'Every time you seem me you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today.' More officers arrive and when Mr Garner refuses to put his hands behind his back to be cuffed, an officer grabs him from behind in a chokehold. Several other officers then wrestle the man to the ground before one appears to pin his head to the concrete. After repeatedly telling the officers 'I can't breathe', Mr Garner goes quiet and stops struggling. Police are seen on the cellphone footage trying to move bystanders away from the scene. Confrontation: Eric Garner was stopped by police on this sidewalk . Residents reacted with fury following Mr Garner's death. After the incident, posters saying 'no justice, no peace' 'and Another innocent black man has been killed by police brutality. The NYPD must be stopped!' appeared in the area. Reverend Lloyd Land, from the First United Christian Church, told Staten Island Live: 'He was a gentle giant. Insofar as violence, I don't believe if you smack him in the face he would hit you back ... The police have no reason to attack him.' An NYPD internal affairs investigation was reportedly underway. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio promised a full investigation into Mr Garner's death. In a statement on Friday, the mayor said: 'On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my deepest condolences to the family of Mr Garner, who died yesterday afternoon while being placed in police custody. 'We have a responsibility to keep every New Yorker safe, and that includes when individuals are in custody of the NYPD. That is a responsibility that Police Commissioner Bratton and I take very seriously. We are harnessing all resources available to the City to ensure a full and thorough investigation of the circumstances of this tragic incident. 'The NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau is working closely with the Office of the Richmond County District Attorney, which is leading this investigation.'","Eric Garner, a 43-year-old who weighed 400lb and suffered from asthma, can be heard shouting 'I can't breathe' on cellphone footage .

"By . Louise Boyle . The pilot who flew Ebola patient Nancy Writebol the 5,000 miles from Liberia to the U.S. said today that he had no regrets about the risky mission and that he was honored to bring her home. Captain Randy Davis told ABC: 'If I had this to do over again, I would be one of the first to volunteer.' Mrs Writebol arrived at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia on Tuesday where she was stretchered into a specially-quarantined wing by medics in biohazard suits. Scroll down for video . Captain Randy Davis, who flew Ebola patient Nancy Writebol back to the U.S. from Liberia, said today it was an honor to perform the task and he would volunteer again if needed . Nancy Writebol, an American aid worker, is transported into Emory University Hospital on Tuesday completely covered. The two medics transporting the 59-year-old Ebola patient wore protective suits and masks . She had traveled in a chartered jet in a portable, disposable bed. Captain Davis said that the bed allowed Mrs Writebol to be comfortable on the long flight but also kept the crew safe. The captain had little hesitation flying with Mrs Writebol as a passenger, despite the deadly risk of Ebola on board. 'I think everybody everywhere would agree that you'd like to try to help people who are so selfless,' Captain Davis said to ABC News. American medical teams were taking no chances with Ebola which has no known cure and is fatal in 90 per cent of patients. Mrs Writebol, a 59-year-old aid worker, was wheeled into the unit covered from head-to-toe in protective covering and with her eyes closed. She appeared to be in a more serious condition that her colleague who contracted Ebola, Dr Kent Brantly, who had been seen walking into the hospital on Saturday. The hospital released an encouraging statement on Wednesday revealing that Mrs Writebol was eating and speaking. Her sons are with her at the hospital and her husband is traveling back to the U.S. from Liberia. An Emory University Hospital spokesman also revealed that Mrs Writebol had walked on to the plane in Liberia. Mrs Writebol showed some improvement this past weekend and even asked for Liberian potato soup - her favorite meal, family and friends said. A special portable and disposable hospital bed was set up in the chartered jet (pictured) to carry Mrs Writebol on the long journey back to the U.S. from West Africa . Nancy Writebol and her husband David were being sponsored to work in Africa by their church in Charlotte, North Carolina when she contracted the deadly virus. Her husband is currently on his way home from Liberia to be at her bedside . The two Americans infected with Ebola are receiving an experimental drug so novel that it has never been tested for safety in humans. The experimental treatment is made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical of San Diego, with funding from the government. The treatment is aimed at boosting the immune system’s efforts to fight off the virus. It is made from antibodies produced by lab animals exposed to parts of the Ebola virus. It’s unclear whether the experimental treatment played a part in the recent improvements in the aid workers’ medical conditions. The World Health Organization said today that 932 people have now died from Ebola - rising from the 887 deaths reported two days ago. Dr Brantly, seen here with his wife Amber, is improving at Emory University Hospital after receiving a dose of an experimental serum. His colleague, Nancy Writebol, joined him at the pioneering hospital on Tuesday .","Captain Randy Davis said he would volunteer again without hesitation  to help someone as 'selfless' as Nancy Writebol .

"By . Pedro Oliveira Jr. First responders in New Jersey did not hesitate to smash an SUV's windows when they saw a lifeless infant locked inside the hot car in Hoboken on Thursday. It was only once the damage was done that the rescue crew realized their mistake: the body inside was no baby, it was just Todd the doll. 'I saw pictures of the doll and it looked real,' Thomas Molta, president of the Hoboken Volunteer Ambulance Corp., told WABC-TV. 'I got 34 years' experience in EMS and I probably would have broken the window too.' Spot the baby: EMTs in New Jersey say they only had a split second to save the life of what they thought was a baby trapped inside a hot car . As it turns out, the 'lifeless body' was none other than a doll named Todd, whose 2-year-old owner forgot perched inside her grandmother's car . The owner of the vehicle, Kitty Mieles, says her 2-year-old granddaughter left Todd perched up on a seat. A passerby thought it was a baby and called 911. When she went back to her car not long after, it was already too late. ‘Oh no, my car!' she said, according to CBS 2. 'When I got there, everything was broken.' The EMTs have apologized and Hoboken will pay for the the smashed window. 'The guys that were on the ambulance are . taking a beating by their coworkers, but it’s all in good fun,' Molta told CBS 2. 'But again, I’d . rather err on the side of caution,' he added. 'You can replace a window — you can’t . replace a life.” The zealous EMTs had good reason to . exercise caution: every summer, dozens of children are left inside . sweltering cars across the US and die when temperatures rise. Kitty Mieles says the EMTs have apologized for breaking her car windows and that Hoboken will pay for the damage . 'Seconds are paramount there, that's the difference between a baby breathing, not breathing, pulse, no pulse,' Molta told WABC-TV. Some 44 children died inside hot cars last year. So far in 2014, there have been 19 deaths nationwide. A Kansas father was recently charged with murder after he forgot his 10-month-old foster daughter inside a car for two hours, resulting in her death. In Texas, a 59-year-old man is also facing criminal charges after he left his 20-month-old granddaughter in a sweltering vehicle for more than six hours. And in California, a 37-year-old mother is accused of child endangerment after she left her two toddlers inside a hot car while she gambled. Luckily, the children were rescued in time, unharmed.","Zealous rescuers made a split-second decision to save what appeared to be a child trapped inside an SUV .

The results of his labor are obvious: the trails and holes he's dug up zig-zag through Cheasty Greenspace, complete with ditches, steps and even an elaborate irrigation system. 'They call him the Moleman,' neighbor Ed Newbold told KIRO-TV. 'He has a fear of what he calls noxious weeds, and he's dug up about half-acre of the area.' A Seattle homeless man known as 'Moleman' has dug up a series of elaborate ditches throughout the Cheasty Greenspace . But nobody in the neighborhood of Beacon Hill can find the man, who local residents say may be called 'James.' Seattle Parks officials often find signs that he's been around, from mattresses to trash cans left behind in Cheasty Greenspace, a 43-acre woodland habitat in south Seattle. Yet they're still trying to hand the man a no-trespassing order, after he's ignored all their notices to remove his belongings from the park. Just on Wednesday, they combed through the park once again — but Moleman was nowhere to be found, KIRO-TV reported. Along with the holes, parks officials usually find mattresses and trash as signs that Moleman has been around . Local environmentalists say Moleman's work has destroyed some of the city's wetlands, aside from being plain unsightly . Neighbors say that they've complained for some four years. 'They are ignoring their own responsibility,' Newbold told the station. 'As stewards of this land, they should be doing something about it.' Local environmentalists say Moleman has destroyed sensitive parts of the park, including protected wetlands. Along with ditches, Moleman has created a series of stairs and even an irrigation system going through the Seattle park . Taxpayers will have to pick up the tab, to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars, KIRO-TV reported. 'It's not only unsightly,' Newbold told the station. 'It's doing real damage to the area.' City officials say that Moleman is homeless and they're trying refer him to social services in hopes of finding him a new place to live.

"By . Pedro Oliveira Jr. A widower in Florida says his church canceled his husband's funeral a day beforehand because parishioners found out he was gay and complained about the planned service. Kendall Capers, of Tampa, says his partner of 17 years, Julion Evans-Capers, died late last month after a four-year battle against Amyloidosis, a rare illness that attacks the organs in the body. The couple was married last year in Maryland. Mourners were already at Evans-Capers' wake when leaders at New Hope Missionary Baptist Church in Tampa started receiving calls from parishioners, who were angered when a local newspaper ran an obituary listing Capers and Evans as married. The man's mother, Julie Atwood, was told that holding the funeral at the Christian church would be 'blasphemous' — and the family was sent packing, she says. 'I did feel like he was being denied the dignity of death,' Atwood told WFLA. 'It was devastating.' Widower: Kendall Capers (right) says his local church canceled his husband Julion Evans-Capers' funeral after parishioners complained that the couple's union was 'blasphemous' Pastor T.W.

Jenkins, did not immediately reply to a MailOnline request for comment on Friday. But the minister told WFLA that his . faith preaches against gay marriage, and he canceled the service after . members from his congregation called to complain. 'Based on . our preaching of the scripture, we would have been in error to allow the . service in our church,' Jenkins told the station. 'I'm not trying to . condemn anyone's lifestyle, but at the same time, I am a man of God, and . I have to stand up for my principles.' Capers says his family scrambled to put another service together, but with just 24 hours notice, many mourners didn't make it to the new location. The distraught husband said he would have understood the church's position had he been given enough notice. No secret: the couple had been together for 17 years and tied the knot last year in Maryland. Kendall Capers says they were always open about being gay . 'If you agree to something, three and four days later, agree to it and stick to your plan, don't change at the last minute because your church constituents are calling you, or the church members are calling you to complain,' Capers told FOX 13. 'Stand your ground.' 'I know there are other people that are probably going to be in the same shoes Julion and I were in,' he added.

"By . Pedro Oliveira Jr. A serial killer in Indiana is boasting of his murder streak with a sickening tattoo that has left prison officials scratching their heads to figure out how the death row inmate even got inked in the first place. The marking — 'Death Row x3' — covers most of the back of William Clyde Gibson's head, in a clear reference to the three women he's admitted to having sexually attacked and brutally killed. William Clyde Gibson'S tattoo makes it pretty clear how he feels about his crimes. Officials, meanwhile, are still trying to figure out who let him get the tattoo, which was only pictured on July 30 because no cameras are allowed inside Indiana courtrooms . Guilty: William Clyde Gibson has been convicted in one murder and pleaded guilty to another two. In all cases, he admitted to sexually assaulting his victims, ranging in age from 35 to 75 . But ever since Gibson showed up with the tattoo in court in March, officials at the Floyd County jail . and the state Department of Corrections have been . passing the buck on who let the inmate get inked. Gibson has been in police custody since April 2012, when he was first arrested for strangling Stephanie Kirk, 35, and Christine Whitis, 75, along with the 2002 stabbing death of Karen Hodella, 44. 'When they took him to corrections and released him over to [DOC], his head was completely shaved at that point, and no tattooing was visible at that time,' Sheriff Darrell Mills told WAVE 3. But over on death row, the story is the exact opposite. Officials there have shifted the blame to the county jailers, saying that if he'd been tattooed while in state custody, Gibson would have been written up. 'He was held at high security risk and maximum security while in my facility,' Sheriff Mills countered.  'We know the tattooing didn't occur here.' Last . fall, Gibson was sentenced to death for the murder of his mother's best . friend, Whitis, who was found mutilated inside his garage. Then . in March of this year, Gibson pleaded guilty to killing Karen Hodella . and was sentenced to 65 years in prison for the crime. Hodella was . stabbed to death in 2002, and her body was found near the Ohio River in . Clarksville at the beginning of 2003. Gibson is standing trial for the murder of Stephanie Kirk, whose remains were found buried in his s backyard. He's already pleaded guilty to the death, but the trial is necessary to determine if he'll be sentenced to death .

He is currently standing trial for the murder of Kirk', whose remains were found buried in Gibson's backyard. He's already pleaded guilty to the death, but the trial is necessary to determine if he'll be sentenced to death. District Attorney Keith Henderson, who is prosecuting Gibson on the latest charges, said the tattoo could be damaging because it might make it difficult for a jury to see Gibson impartially. 'It potentially affects the prosecution of a very important case,' he told WDRB.

Shaun Hiles, 35, whose wife Nicole Hiles, also, 35, then turned the rifle on himself, shooting himself in the stomach and the chest, but failed to end his own life. The attack came just hours after Hiles had posted angry Facebook messages revealing he knew his wife was in a new relationship with Larry Whiteker, 32 and eight hours after Nicole filed an emergency restraining order against her estranged husband. Prior: Shaun Hiles, 35, is pictured here in his arrest photograph after beating a co-worker with an aluminum pole in April and is now accused of shooting dead his wife and her new boyfriend on a rural Kentucky road on Monday night . Police in the tiny town of Dry Ridge say that Hiles rammed his truck into Whiteker's truck around 11.30 pm after chasing them and then when they had both crashed opened fire with a .357 caliber handgun, killing his wife and then used an AR-15 to shot dead Whiteker. On Facebook, Shaun posted several times about discovering his wife's infidelity — and gave out grim warnings about what might come next. 'The moment when you check your cell phone bills and you catch your wife cheating on you priceless,' posted on Thursday. Then next day, he wrote, 'The war has began!!!!!!!

However, it was too late in the day and by the time a judge would have been able to sign it, she and her new boyfriend had been shot dead. 'Talking to her, we learned she's separated from her husband, marital problems, he's tearing her stuff up and I advised her if she had been threatened, she could get an emergency protection order,' Grant County Sheriff Chuck Dills told the Cincinnati Enquirer. 'He (Shaun) had been chasing after them,' Dills told the newspaper. 'We're learning that his wife was seeing this other person and he was upset over it.' Spurned: On Facebook, Shaun Hiles posted grim warnings about what he expected out of separating his wife Nicole .

Hiles and his wife have a 14-year-old daughter together and Nicole Hiles has a child from a previous relationship said Dills. It was also revealed that Hills has a violent past - he has a separate misdemeanor battery case that is pending in Dearborn Couty and was scheduled to appear in court on Friday. He is accused of punching a co-worker and beating him with an aluminum tire iron in the parking lot of a trucking company .

"By . Pedro Oliveira Jr. The morgue at a hospital in Washington, DC, is infested with rodents that scratch and dine on cadavers stored there, a former contractor claims. '[Rats] were actually gnawing inside of the bags and leaving the remnants . of where they were eating to get inside of the bags,' Doris Kennard, who ran the morgue at Providence Hospital for two years, told FOX 5.

'They were going into places like . the anal area, the vaginal area, the pubic area of the males,' Kennard told FOX 5. 'That's where they would get in.' Kennard claims to have been attacked herself many times, once even needing a battery of exams and treatment. She sued the hospital for emotional distress in 2012 and last week was awarded $237,000 by a jury, court records show. Providence spokeswoman Karol Marciano did not immediately reply to a MailOnline call seeking comment. Attacked: Kennard says she has been bitten multiple times by the rats she claims overrun the morgue at Providence Hospital . The former contractor says the rats were so vicious, she ended up hospitalized and had to undergo a series of examinations . Kennard claims not even traps set near the morgue could stop rats from taking over the place . Kennard's attorney, Gregory Lattimer, claims rodents have run amok at Providence Hospital for decades, and the hospital has tried to 'cover this thing up from day one.' 'If you look down there now, I'm willing to bet you'll find the same problem and it may even be bigger,' he told FOX 5. Kennard says she remains traumatized. 'It could have been anyone in my family, and every time I think about the way those people were treated and doing with a hospital like Providence Hospital, nothing like this should never happen in any hospital in the United States,' she told the station.

"By . Pedro Oliveira Jr. An old piano warehouse in Indiana that was engulfed in an inferno this weekend yielded a sight as stunning as it was unexpected: a huge rainbow that showed up as firefighters tried to douse the flames with water. The rare sight happened while the Muncie Fire Department tried to quench the flames that broke out about 6:43am on Saturday, The Star Press reported. Stunning: Firefighters in Indiana accidentally created this gorgeous rainbow while battling a raging blaze inside an old piano factory . Built in 1895, the three-story brick building's wood-framed structure had already caught on fire several times before. This time, the blaze engulfed the entire building in just an hour  — roaring from one end of the huge warehouse to the other, sounding like a series of explosions at times — and kept fire crews busy for nearly the whole weekend. Even on Monday morning, firefighters were still dumping water on the structure from an aerial truck as flare-ups continued to show up here and then. They also kept trees nearby wet so the flames wouldn't spread. Authorities say the 119-year-old structure's wooden frames and beams caused the fire to engulf the building as quickly as it did . The warehouse had already caught on fire several times before, but never with such intensity . Batallion Chief Terry Moore told the Star Press that his crews are yet to enter the building for fear it might collapse. The building was deemed unsafe to be occupied as far back as 2011, when the place was covered in trash and windows were broken out, according to The Star Press. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. No injuries were reported. Firefighters spend nearly the entire weekend trying to bring the fire down, and were still at the warehouse on Monday morning to make sure the blaze wouldn't reignite .","119-year-old structure burns for whole weekend in Muncie, Indiana .

'The influx of unaccompanied child migrants is a growing humanitarian crisis that we can no longer ignore,' the mayor told the Chicago Tribune on Sunday. Emanuel will use federal funds to build new shelters in addition to nine others in Chicago that already house some 500 migrant children. He will also push for a  'broad based pro-bono campaign' to expand legal services offered to the minors.

'While we have our own challenges at home, we cannot turn our backs on children that are fleeing dangerous conditions,' said Emanuel, a former chief of staff to President Obama. 'We will do our part to ensure that these children are given access to services and treated fairly and humanely.' Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has also vowed to shelter some of the tens of thousands of children apprehended at the border. Details are still being ironed out, but the city will likely use federal funds to shelter the children and offer them legal advice, the Los Angeles Times reported. Nonprofits are expected to find them more permanent accommodations. Undocumented children who are apprehended at the border, like the ones pictured here, will also receive legal advice in Chicago . 'Before you get partisan, before you tell me where you are on immigration: these are children,' Garcetti told reporters recently, according to the paper. 'As a father, who are we as Americans if we don’t step forward first and say: these kids who are isolated, alone … let’s get them someplace safe and secure.' The mayor of Los Angeles is also offering shelter to undocumented kids, like this 6-year-old boy from El Salvador . The mayors are responding to the growing crisis in the US border, where more than 57,500 unaccompanied minors have been apprehended since October, according to US Customs and Border Protection.

Larry Burns, who is advising the self-driving project for Google, is confident driverless cars would be popular within just a few years, but believes the real challenge would be regulations and consumers getting used to the new systems. 'Most of the true leaders in this field say by 2017-2018 the car will be able to drive itself, anywhere, anytime without any human input,' Mr Burns told the ABC. Scroll down for video . Driverless cars could be on the streets by 2017 as technology continues to show increasing promise, experts say . 'I think it's going to be very compelling, I think it's going to grow to a very large scale over a couple of decades.' Larry Burns, who is advising the self-driving project for Google, is confident driverless cars would be popular within just a few years . The former vice president of General Motors was in Adelaide to give a talk on the future of the car. Mr Burns said cars that move people around busy CBDs without anyone at the wheel would gain popularity once people realise how easy the mode of transportation is. 'The way to get past those hurdles really is just to get out and start trying it on a small scale and learn and show people it's possible,' he said. He said safety would be a huge selling point to get driverless cars as a mainstream vehicle. 'Basically the car makes two simple decisions simultaneously, ""How fast should I go and which way should I steer?"", he said. 'Once you get the driver out of the loop the vehicle becomes much, much safer. Traffic safety experts say about 90 percent of crashes are due to human error. 'If cars don't crash we can now tailor their design to the typical trip we take, which is one and two person. That allows us to have a much smaller vehicle, which is much more energy-efficient, space efficient.' Penny Gale from the Royal Automobile Association of South Australia said they were eyeing potential opportunities for car manufacturing. 'The ideas we're talking about might create new opportunities... Whether we build the driverless cars here in South Australia or build the robots that will help build those vehicles, it shows a lot of promise,' Ms Gale said.

Braving horrific conditions, these workers breathe in highly noxious gases without masks while they risk their lives carrying loads of up to 70kg up steep quarry walls. The men - working in Ijen, a super volcanic range in East Java, Indonesia - have a short life expectancy as a result of the hardship they face on a daily basis. Scroll down for video . Grueling: With a scarf wrpped around his head, a miner begins the punishing climb out of the crater of a mine in Indonesia on his way to the collection point with his baskets, which usually hold over 70kg of sulphur . Danger: Workers risk their lives in highly toxic sulphur mines at the Kawah Ijen volcano in East Java, Indonesia . Toxic: A miner braces himself before lifting heavy baskets laden with sulphur while fumes billow out behind him . Perilous: With blocks of sulphur in a basket slung over his back, this miner sets off to a collections point and prepares to cross wooden planks over a crevice while toxic fumes fill the air . The sulphur they produce is used to make a huge range of products from concrete and asphalt to matches and the bleaching of white sugar. Many of them work shirtless, and have huge growths on their back from the loads. Photographer Brad Ambrose captured the breathtaking pictures along with his friend Geoff Mackley, while trekking through Indonesia. The 38-year-old photographer said: 'It would be one of the more dangerous jobs in the world - not just because of the fall risks, but because of the gases the miners work in.

"By . Emily Crane . and Sarah Dean . Taxpayers could be forking out hundreds of millions of dollars a year so security agencies can properly monitor Australian jihadists returning from conflicts in the Middle East. Surveillance costs are expected to tip $8 million for just one jihadist as intelligence teams monitor the 150 or so Australians who may return home having been suspected of fighting in countries like Syria and Iraq, the Australian reports. The high spending comes as police and surveillance agencies prepare for potentially the largest monitoring operation in Australia to stop suspected fighters becoming home-grown terrorists. Scroll down for video . Mohamed Elomar, who is believed to have left Australia last year to fight in Syria, is shown holding up the decapitated heads of two men . Khaled Sharrouf, from Sydney, is thought to be fighting with al-Qaeda off-shoot Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant . The $8 million sum would reportedly cover eight-person surveillance teams working on five different rolling shifts for the entire year. It also includes transport and high-tech surveillance equipment. It comes as the federal government announced an additional $600 million in counter-terror funding this week for five different agencies, including the domestic spy agency ASIO and the Australian Federal Police. While security agencies will not reveal specific target numbers or spending figures, it is expected that some of the extra funding will be spent on this extra and expensive surveillance. 'The important thing here is to give us the tools that we need to ensure that people who are a serious threat to our country are appropriately dealt with,' Prime Minister Tony Abbott said this week. Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced an additional $600 million in counter-terror funding this week for five different agencies, including the domestic spy agency ASIO and the Australian Federal Police . The funding came as an Australian jihadist posed with decapitated heads and supposedly gave advice on how people could access deadly explosives in Sydney on Twitter. Mohamed Elomar, who is wanted by the Australian Federal Police for his activities in the Middle East,  renewed his social media attack on his former home country on a new Twitter account after his previous one was shut down last week. The 30-year-old invited wannabe jihadists in Sydney - the city where he was born - to contact him if they want to get their hands on dynamite and grenades. 'Anyone in Sydney who is after explosives (dynamite sticks, C4 sticks, orica mine sticks, grenades ) lots more. If interested DM me,' he wrote. Elomar invited wannabe jihadists in Sydney to contact him if they want to get their hands on explosives. Mohamed Elomar gave tips on the best way to avoid the security services . He reportedly set up the Twitter account after his previous one was shut down . The 30-year-old advised 'brothers who are confused about jihad' to get in touch . He also gave tips on the best way to avoid the security services. 'Buy a phone cover ur idenity if you have to wear a Niqab, activate simcard with false details, when u use phone make sure in different area,' he wrote.

Elomar and his friend Khaled Sharrouf, also from Sydney, are thought to be fighting with al-Qaeda off-shoot Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and will be arrested on terrorism-related charges if they ever return to Australia. Before Elomar's previous Twitter account was shut down last week, he wrote that Australia should be worried about what is coming to it. He also sent tweets aimed directly at ASIO earlier this month, claiming he had been injured but would soon be fighting again. Offering up his advice to 'brothers who are confused about Jihad in the West' he said 'please DM I would love to have a chat'. The account that is purporting to belong to Elomar also claimed he had 'just divorced his wife'. Elomar's wife Fatima, 29, appeared in court in Sydney on July 8 after she was arrested by joint counter-terrorism detectives at Sydney Airport on May 3 while trying to board a flight to Malaysia. She was alleged to be carrying cash and camouflage gear on behalf of Elomar. Mohamed Elomar will be arrested on terrorism-related charges if he ever returns to Australia . The tweets claim he has divorced his wife Fatima, 29, because she kept 'insisting' on it . Fatima Elomar appeared in court with their four children after appearing on terrorism related charges . Elomar said he will see his children on the 'day of judgement' She was later charged with supporting terrorism, specifically 'preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities'. The pair have four children together. 'To my 4 beautiful kids inshallah I will see them on day of judgment, this is islam allah swt will test us and test us,' Elomar wrote on Sunday. Elomar's jihadist friend Sharrouf previously spent time in jail for his part in a foiled plot to blow up targets in Sydney and Melbourne. He is thought to have flown to Syria with Elomar late last year on his brother Mustafa's passport. Sharrouf has also taunted Australian police via his social media account recently, boasting that he would 'slaughter' Australians. Mohomed Elomar (right) used to be a champion boxer. Here he is seen fighting Pises Buachai at the Entertainment Centre in Sydney, Wednesday, March 7, 2007. Elomar won the fight. Convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf has threatened the Australian Federal Police and his countrymen on his Twitter account . Elomar is also the brother of Ahmed Elomar, who was arrested in Lebanon for alleged terrorist links in 2007 and then sentenced to jail in Sydney in June for brutally bashing a police officer in the Hyde Park riots. The two brothers, Ahmed and Mohamed, used to be champion boxers - Ahmed has competed in more than 20 professional bouts. In 2007, their father Mamdouh Elomar slammed the clerics who he believes radicalised his sons in Sydney.","Taxpayers could fork out hundreds of millions each year for proper surveillance for Australian jihadists .

He's the colourful identity and former bikie associate who was left bleeding to death three years ago on an affluent Sydney street after being stabbed nine times in broad daylight. Now, Kings Cross party boy Mark James Judge has taken time away from Sydney and changed his name to continue his love of nightlife across the globe. The 34-year-old former Rebels bikie associate has dropped his surname on his social media profile and now calls himself Mark James as he jet sets around Europe and Africa with his girlfriend Claire Thompson. Scroll down for video . Mark Judge has tweaked his name on social media sites to Mark James as he jet sets around Europe and Africa with his girlfriend Claire Thompson . Judge, who is a regular on the Sydney party scene, first catapulted into the public limelight in 2009 after a bizarre episode with former Home & Away actress Jodi Gordon, who is now the wife of NRL star Braith Anasta. The pair, who met that night at a bar in Kings Cross, were found by police huddled in the bedroom of his Bellevue Hill home after they sparked an emergency operation after claiming to see armed men on CCTV cameras trying to break in. The well-known ladies' man was found bleeding to death on an upmarket Sydney street after he was violently stabbed nine times in 2011. He was found collapsed on the footpath outside his apartment by two friends who were driving past after the attack. The 34-year-old, pictured here with the late Charlotte Dawson last year, is a regular on the Sydney party scene . Judge, who grew up near Penrith in western Sydney, started out as a doorman for a Rebels clubhouse. He never joined the club and instead chose to remain an associate.

Judge admitted in court three years ago to amphetamine and steroid use in the past but his lawyer said he had been clean for several years. He was spared a full time jail sentence in 2005 after pleading guilty to bashing a furniture store owner and using a brick to crush the man's finger when he tried to reclaim some of the $70,000 he had lent him. Judge, who counts Kings Cross nightclub owner John Ibrahim as a friend, was among the first to be banned from the notorious nightclub strip for alleged bad behaviour alongside former NRL player John Hopoate in 2013. The bans were subsequently overturned on appeal. Judge, pictured here leaving court, was acquitted late last year of assault charges relating to a bloody brawl involving four people near Kings Cross police station on July 21, 2013 .

"By . Emily Crane . Australian customs officials are on high alert as the deadly Ebola virus spreads across the world. The federal government's top health experts have met with border protection agencies who will step up monitoring and screening of incoming passengers at Australian airports  as fear mounts about the world's largest outbreak of Ebola. Dr Glenn Marsh, a CSIRO research scientist currently working on a vaccine for the deadly virus, said it was 'always possible' Ebola could reach Australian shores. Scroll down for video . CSIRO research scientist Dr Glenn Marsh is working with live Ebola samples at a high containment laboratory in Geelong . 'Airline staff and customs are all on the lookout for any passengers with signs and symptoms of ebolavirus infection,' Dr Marsh told Daily Mail Australia. Dr Marsh, who is working with live Ebola samples at a high containment laboratory in Geelong near Melbourne, said the huge outbreak in West Africa was 'terrifying' and 'seems to be fairly out of control'. 'Fortunately we have a very good health care system here in Australia so it is highly unlikely that disease would spread here,' he said. 'We are very well equipped to contain the virus and stop it spreading in Australia. 'The key to managing an outbreak is rapid diagnosis and then to ensure that the infected patients are managed appropriately including ensuring all health care workers are wearing gowns, gloves and masks.' Dr Marsh said the huge outbreak of Ebola in West Africa was 'terrifying' and 'seems to be fairly out of control' The death of an American citizen from Ebola last week has sparked alarm across the globe after he was able to board an international flight while carrying the incurable disease – potentially infecting other passengers who could fly across the world. Ebola spreads via bodily fluids so secretions from infected people generally contain the virus, according to Dr Marsh. Border protection officers are on alert to check people who are unwell as they land in Australia to detect Ebola symptoms. ' 'Australia has one of the best border protection systems in the world checking people who are unwell in flight and at the airport,' Australia's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Baggoley said. 'Since the Ebola outbreak the Department of Health has been in contact with all border protection agencies to alert them to look out for the possibility of Ebola when identifying a person landing in Australia who is unwell. The Department of Foreign Affairs has urged Australians not to travel to the West African nations affected by the virus. They said there is little the federal government can do if they run into trouble. Australian embassy staff have deferred travel plans to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. 'We recommend Australian travellers do the same,' the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says in its latest updated advice. There's a real risk that Australians travelling in the region could become stranded if the outbreak worsens. DFAT warns that borders in the region could close and travel restrictions be imposed with 'little or no warning'. Australians who ignore the government's advice are being urged to check their travel insurance as medical evacuations for any Ebola patient would be 'extremely difficult to conduct'. 'The Australian government may have limited options in providing consular assistance in these circumstances,' DFAT says. Those in the region should closely monitor local health advice and know the symptoms of the virus. Symptoms are are severe and include high fever and weakness followed by external and internal bleeding. Any traveller to the region showing these signs before or after visiting should seek medical attention. Victims of the virus, or those suffering symptoms, should be avoided at all costs as the disease is highly contagious. Dr Marsh will start working with ferrets to research potential Ebola vaccines because they have displayed human-like infections with other high-risk pathogens . Health workers in West Africa wear protective gear on the way to bury a woman who died of the Ebola virus from the isolation unit in Foya, Lofa County, Liberia'These systems have been rigorously tested with both the SARS outbreak and the more recent Swine Flu pandemic of 2009.' While the Department of Health says the likelihood of Ebola coming to Australia is low, health authorities from around the country are discussing the possibility and subsequent ways to respond. If there was a suspected case picked up by border protection, there are laboratories with the highest level of physical containment in Australia. '(This) provides laboratory space, testing facilities, diagnostic methods and highly trained virology and medical science staff capable of handling Ebola and other viruses that cause viral haemorrhagic fever,' Prof Baggoley said. American citizen, Patrick Sawyer, 40, died last week from Ebola after becoming noticeably ill on a flight from Liberia in West Africa to Lagos, Nigeria . The CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong will start working with ferrets to research potential Ebola vaccines because they have displayed human-like infections with other high-risk pathogens. 'All work with ebolaviruses is at the highest level of bio containment deep within AAHL’s solid walls and we must work on the virus wearing fully encapsulated suits with an external air supply,' Dr Marsh said. 'We are investigating the pathogenicity, or disease causing ability, of these virus strains to understand why the African strains have a high fatality rate in people, compared to the Asian strain, which does not cause human disease.' 'We believe that understanding the differences in virulence between these two closely related strains of ebolavirus may hold the key to developing an effective vaccine to prevent this deadly disease, or therapeutics to treat it.'

"By . Ryan Lipman . and Emily Crane . Jetstar has apologised after a crew member advised Splendour in the Grass festival goers to dump their drugs before the plane landed in Sydney. People who attended the music festival near Byron Bay were on a flight out of the Gold Coast on Sunday night when the crew member issued a public announcement. The flight attendant said sniffer dogs and quarantine officers were waiting at the domestic terminal and advised them to flush 'anything you shouldn't have' down the toilet. The announcement reportedly sparked a rush to the bathrooms. Jetstar confirmed an employee made their own quarantine announcement about sniffer dogs waiting at Sydney Airport late Sunday night . Jetstar says the staff member will be reprimanded. The airline says the staffer was complying with a requirement that airlines make quarantine announcements, but the crew member's words were 'poorly chosen and plainly at odds with the professional standards we'd expect from our team'. But some took a more positive view. 'Thank you for caring for your Splendour passengers,' one person posted on Jetstar Australia's Facebook page. 'Very thoughtful and kind thing to do. 'Hope the staff member will be promoted.' There are reports a number of passengers dashed for the plane's toilets and were seen queuing as they clenched things in their hands. But the crew member's announcement left some passengers angered and questioning the reasoning behind warning people who may have been breaking the law and otherwise could have been caught. The plane was arriving from the Gold Coast to Sydney and was full of passengers who had been at the Splendour in the Grass music festival, pictured, in Byron Bay . The airline confirmed the employee made his own improvised quarantine announcement rather than the using prerecorded one used by Jetstar. A spokesman said the airline is required to play the prerecorded announcement to passengers on all interstate and territory boarders and that its procedures allow cabin crew to deliver the quarantine message through public announcement as was done on this occasion. 'The crew member's words were poorly chosen and are plainly at odds with the professional standards we'd expect from our team. We're addressing the matter with the cabin crew member involved.'

Baden-Clay was found guilty on July 15 of killing Allison and dumping her body under a bridge 13km from their Brisbane home two years ago. Ms McHugh told the magazine she drove over the Kholo Creek bridge while Allison's undiscovered body laid during the 10-day search for the Brisbane mother. 'We drove over the bridge and she was under there, and later that day, maybe around noon, we heard a woman’s body has been found, and I knew straight away – instantly – that it was Allison.' The real estate agent, who started the affair with Baden-Clay when he was her boss, said she considered herself Australia's Monica Lewinsky, the mistress of former US President Bill Clinton, and she planned to write a book about the case. 'I'm still coping with the damage, emotionally and financially. I lost my job, which I loved, and which I was good at.

I remember after police told me, Gerard called me from a blocked number and said `I’m outside your office, I’m in a cab, I have to talk to you’ and the first thing he said when I got in the cab was `are you wearing a wire?’.’ Ms McHugh said they went to a unit in the inner Brisbane suburb of Fortitude Valley where Baden-Clay gave her reasons for having sex with other women. 'Because he wanted to make sure what he had with me was 'real’,’’ Ms McHugh said of his reasons. Ms McHugh also said she only came to believe Baden-Clay was responsible for his wife’s murder earlier this year. 'If you were told that your child had done something terrible, think about how much you love your children, how long it would take you to come to terms with that?' she said.

'Almost all of them, including the adults, were coughing, were sick, were depressed, unable to communicate, were weak,' Ms Triggs told the ABC. 'Some of them (are) not leaving their cabins, are not eating. 'But the other thing that was distressing was the mental decline - children who wouldn't even make eye contact.' Ms Triggs who was accompanied by paediatrician Professor Elizabeth Elliott said she and her team interviewed hundreds of detainees over three days as part of a national inquiry into the mandatory detention of children seeking asylum in Australia. A high majority of the 174 child asylum seekers at Christmas Island were reportedly sick and many had developed speech impediments .

While there's almost half the number of children at Christmas Island compared to the last visit in March, Ms Elliott said that there is still too many under current conditions. 'Christmas Island is no place for young children,' she said.

Safety levels at three Australian airports run by military air traffic controllers has come under fire after a former Qantas chief pilot called on the government to investigate why their safety records were poorer than those of civilian counterparts. Chris Manning, who was Qantas' chief pilot from 2002-08, has called for a three person independent inquiry to examine why Darwin, Townsville and Newcastle airports are at higher risk of experiencing mid-air collisions, the  Australian reports. The three airports, while not unsafe, have a higher number of 'loss of separation' incidents, which means passenger planes pass too close to each other, according to an Australian Transport Safety Bureau report. Scroll down for video . Former Qantas chief pilot Chris Manning has called for an independent inquiry into safety levels at three Australian airports run by military air traffic controllers . 'There should be no difference in the level of safety at all towered aerodromes that civil aircraft use,' Mr Manning told the newspaper. The report, released in October last year, found that military controllers were involved in 36 percent of loss of separation occurrences between 2008-12, even though they were responsible for controlling only 25 percent of aircraft movements. 'Most of these loss of separation occurrences were contributed to by air traffic controller actions,' the ATSB report found. 'This may be a result of the nature of aircraft operations and airspace constraints at some military airports, leading to reduced use and effectiveness of strategic separation defences, thereby placing more responsibility for separating aircraft directly onto the controllers.' Newcastle Airport is one of three run by military air traffic controllers because they are adjacent to military bases . Darwin, Townsville and Newcastle airports are all next to military bases, which means military air traffic controllers are responsible for controlling civil air traffic too. 'I find it difficult to believe that a ATSB report that highlights safety issues has received scant attention - makes you wonder why they bother doing a report if there's no obvious desire to address the real problems raised,' Mr Manning said. He has also called on the government to subject Australia's military air traffic controllers to the same safety auditing the Civil Aviation Safety Authority conducts on its civilian counterparts.

'Rome has been battling his guts out for the past five and a half years... He has constantly been juggling medicine, treatments, supplements, therapies and operations,' a post on his supporter Facebook page said. 'Rome recently had a big fight for his health and came through with miraculous results. At the end of that battle, he also made a big decision. That decision was to switch from fight to peace.' Mr Torti underwent major surgery two days before Christmas last year so renowned surgeon Dr Charlie Teo could remove the Giloblatoma Multiforme Grade 4 malignant brain tumour and buy the young father some time. The photographer has been battling cancer for the same amount of time he's been married to wife Rachel and the entirety of his son Ryder' life . But the tumour, which had begun to wrap around Mr Torti's brain stem, was one of the worst Dr Teo had seen and the operation left him with paralysis. Mr Torti, a well known skate photographer on the Gold Coast, had already tried chemotherapy, radiation, natural therapies, supplements, oxygen therapy and even an expensive experimental German treatment called oncothermia, which he planned to try once more this year in Germany. 'He and his family have spent all their free time and energy fighting against a tumour that was supposed to take him years ago,' the Facebook page post said. Rome and Rachel had sold their house and car and cashed in their savings and superannuation to help fund the rehabilitation, treatment and medical bills over the past five years .

"By . Emily Crane . A small family-run brewery in Sydney will continue to sell beer under its current name after winning a two-year trademark battle against multi-billion dollar beer company, SABMiller. The global company tried to stop the Sydney-based  brewery from selling its craft ale back in 2012 when owner Peter Philip tried to register the Wayward Brewing name. Executives from SABMiller India thought the name was too similar to its Indian brewed Haywards 2000 and Haywards 5000 beer. SABMiller tried to stop the Sydney-based brewery from selling its craft ale back in 2012 when owner Peter Philip went to register the Wayward Brewing name . But an Australian Trade Marks hearing ruled in favour of Wayward Brewing this week and agreed with Mr Philip's argument that the Indian beer was virtually unknown in Australia, according to The Daily Telegraph. 'Maybe they thought that a little guy wouldn't stand up to them, but I always knew we were in the right and I wasn't going to give up without a fight,' Mr Philip said. 'For me it was always personal as I have put my heart and soul into building this business.' SABMiller cited 14 different reasons why the Wayward brand should not be trademarked, including the fact it could have traded off the popularity of the Indian beer. Executives from SABMiller India thought the Wayward name (left) was too similar to its Indian brewed Haywards 2000 and Haywards 5000 beer (right) The Trade Marks Office, however, said Haywards only accounted for less than 0.006 percent of the total Australia beer market in 2011-12. The global company was ordered to pick up the legal bill for the Wayward Brewing. Despite the win, Mr Philip said the case had put him about of pocket by about $20,000. 'It is a great feeling to be finally vindicated in our victory but it has cost us a lot of time, money and stress wondering whether this massive global brewer was going to force us to change our brand and start all over with a new name,' he said. An Australian Trade Marks hearing ruled in favour of Wayward Brewing this week and agreed with Mr Philip's argument that the Indian beer was virtually unknown in Australia . Up until now, Wayward had been what was known as a 'Gypsy Brewery', meaning they utilised equipment from other breweries around Sydney. But the company recently secured premises in the inner western suburb of Camperdown where it will start brewing from in early 2015.","SABMiller tried to stop Sydney-based Wayward Brewing from selling beer .

"By . Gerard Couzens . and Emily Crane . An Australian man who was seriously injured when he was gored by a bull at Spain’s famous San Fermin festival has spoken of the sheer panic he felt as he was chased by the animal with a gaping wound to his leg. Jason Gilbert, a mechanic from Adelaide Hills in South Australia, underwent several hours of surgery at Pamplona’s Virgen del Camino Hospital after being gored in the chest, abdomen and thigh on Monday. Doctors said the horn that penetrated the 25-year-old's chest came dangerously close to touching soft tissue in his neck, but miraculously none of his vital organs were damaged. In recovery: Jason Gilbert was gored at Pamplona's running of the bulls and had to have surgery for his injuries at Virgen del Camino hospital. The 25-year-old Australian said he would never take part in the event again . Lucky to be alive: The bull's horn penetrated Mr Gilbert's chest and came dangerously close to spearing the soft tissues in his neck. He was pinned against the wall for several moments while he was gored by the animal . Torn open: He only realised the severity of his injuries when he looked at his leg . 'It’s the first time I’ve run and I can tell you now it will be the last,' Mr Gilbert said from his hospital bed. 'I felt like I was running for my life as it chased after me the first time it gored me. 'I was in pain and I knew it was bad when I saw my leg was wide open. It was a feeling of sheer and utter panic being chased by the bull.' The 595kg bull named Olivito went on a rampage after becoming separated from the rest of the pack when it slipped and crashed into a wall. Mr Gilbert was pinned against the wall as the bull gored him in the left leg before chasing him and attacking him for a second time as other thrill-seekers and paramedics tried desperately to pull him through the fence sealing off the 850m course. 'I didn’t see the bull fall but I realised I was in trouble when it got back up and trapped me against a wall,' he said. 'After that I really just remember being pulled through the fence by people on the other side. It probably saved my life. Seeing the paramedics and knowing I was out of immediate danger was a feeling of tremendous relief.' Mr Gilbert - who ran wearing a T-shirt with the words 'Real Men Wear Skirts' emblazoned across the chest -  had only arrived in Pamplona just 24 hours before he was injured with three friends he is travelling around Europe with. They are just two weeks into a six-week trip. He said he decided to take part in the last run of the festival after going to watch a bullfight in the town's bullring the day he arrived. 'I spoke with a Spanish man at the bullfight who told me about the number of people who take part and the number of people who get injured every year and I thought ""Why not?"",' he said. ‘I watched the World Cup final and went to bed after that because I wanted to run the following day. Australian man Jason Gilbert, 26, underwent surgery at a hospital in the northern town of Pamplona after being gored in the chest, abdomen and thigh on Monday . The bull broke away from the pack and charged several runners, including Mr Gilbert who is seen hear being lifted off the ground by the bull's horns during the eighth run at Spain's famous San Fermin festival . The bull attacked the 25-year-old with such ferocity that it sent bits of wall flying before goring the Australian in his left leg . Mr Gilbert stood little chance against the bull's mighty horns, which ripped his shorts and left a large chunk of skin missing . 'It was my first time in Pamplona and I’d seen the morning runs on the television before so I knew of the dangers involved. 'I grew up in a regional town and have seen a lot of cattle so I know how powerful bulls are. What shocked me about the bull that gored me was just how aggressive it was.' Doctors say Mr Gilbert will most likely remain in hospital for a week after suffering the gash to his leg, a punctured lung and broken rib. The 25-year-old said while he had no regrets about running, he would not be participating again. 'It's a local tradition and I respect Spaniards who run it every year but I've done it now and got it out of my system and with what's happened, I don't want to repeat,' he said. As the Australian thrill-seeker lifted his legs in a bid to protect himself, the bull thrust its horn through his thigh . Mr Gilbert's friends only realised he had been gored after seeing the images posted repeatedly online. A Spanish friend helped them track down Mr Gilbert and they arrived at the hospital four hours after he was injured. 'I've spoken to family and friends. My parents knew I was going to run and my dad already knows I was hurt,' Mr Gilbert said. 'I haven't spoken to my mum yet and I'm sort of dreading it I suppose. I know she's not going to be very happy.' He said he will wait until he is released from hospital before deciding whether to continue with his trip around Europe or return straight home. Mr Gilbert had only arrived in Pamplona just 24 hours before he was injured with three friends he is travelling around Europe with . He said he was in pain and knew his leg was wide open when he was being chased by the bull . A second Australian, James Andrew Metcalfe from Grenfell in NSW, was left with a 5cm gash to his right thigh after he was gored by the bull in the same area Mr Gilbert was hurt. First aiders were packing up and the other injured were already in hospital when Mr Metcalfe, 24, sought help. He was discharged from hospital later the same morning after receiving treatment. Doctors described his injury as ‘slight.’ Spaniard Enaut Gorriz, 21, from the village of Burlades near Pamplona, was also gored three times. He suffered a 10cm gash to his left thigh and a 15cm gash to his right thigh. Mr Enaut, an architecture student, was taking part in the adrenalin-filled run for the first time. Seven people needed hospital treatment after the last run. Ten of the 47 runners taken to hospital during this year’s festival remained in hospital on Tuesday. Fifteen people have been killed at the annual festival since records began in 1911. Pinned down: But the bull again caught him and pinned him to a barrier as others tried to ward him off . Finally, with the help of a few police officers, Mr Gilbert managed to get behind the fence where he was promptly taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries . The bull would not give up its hunt for the man who had so infuriated it and continued ramming him against the fence . Fellow Australian Nicholas Kordahi told Sydney radio station Triple M's The Grill Team he was also at the running of the bulls when he was charged by one of the beasts, sustaining injuries to his side and ankle. Mr Kordahi shot some footage of the moment the animal made its way towards him and his friends, and described it on air as 'one of the most adrenaline fueling scariest moments I've ever had in my life. Me and my two friends were shaking before the gun went.' Several men have already been gored by bulls during this year's festival but Monday's run, the eighth and last, was particularly brutal. One of the six bulls broke away from the others and charged several runners, lifting two of them off the ground on its horns and ripping through their legs. Other participants tried to distract the bull and eventually herded it into the ring. The runs usually last between three to five minutes, and the bulls then appear in an evening bullfight, when they are killed.","Jason Gilbert, 25, underwent hours of surgery after being gored in the chest, abdomen and thigh on Monday .

Sea urchins are a delicacy in Japan and China and chefs in Tasmania have slowly started to introduce it on their menus. 'Fresh, high-quality ones get premium prices,' Prof Hayward told news.com.au.

Prof Hayward says people should be eating cane toads, sea urchins and camel meat instead of regular options found in supermarket freezers for future sustainability . 'It makes sense to farm other animals that are culled because they are pests,' he said. Most Australians are already shifting away from the standard meats like chicken, beef and lamb, according to Queensland University of Technology's Dr Gary Mortimer. 'People are becoming more adventurous, and shows like MasterChef, which feature a range of more exotic ingredients, are a part of that mind shift,' he said. Camel burgers have been stocked in Coles supermarket stores in 200 stores across the east coast of Australia since May last year.

Harley Hicks, 21, was jailed for life last month after he broke into a Bendigo home in June 2012 and brutally bashed 10-month-old Zayden Veal-Whitting to death. Hicks, who was 19 at the time, offered no explanation during his trial in June for why he bashed the baby more than 30 times with a homemade baton during the marijuana and ice-fuelled robbery. Scroll down for video . Harley Hicks, who was jailed for life last month after brutally bashing 10-month-old Zayden Veal-Whitting to death, has applied to lodge an appeal against his sentence . He pleaded not guilty to the murder and his lawyers argued in court that his twin brother could not be excluded as a suspect. But a Victorian Supreme Court jury rejected the suggestion and found him guilty in April. Lawyers for Hicks applied on Wednesday to appeal his sentence in the state's Court of Appeal. In sentencing Hicks last month, Victorian Supreme Court Justice Stephen Kaye described the killing as a 'totally and utterly evil crime'. 10-month-old Zayden Veal-Whitting was struck more than 30 times with a homemade baton at his Bendigo home in June 2012 . Justice Kaye said he could not say for sure if Hicks had viciously snuffed out Zayden's cry in a bid to silence the baby during the robbery. 'At no stage of the trial could I detect from you any sign of remorse. Nor was there even the slightest indication by you of any pity or sympathy for the baby, whose life you had taken, or for his family, whose lives you have shattered,' he said last month. Hicks broke into the Bendigo home of  Casey Veal and unplugged her son's baby's monitor before repeatedly striking Zayden.

"By . Louise Cheer . Even in the nude, a boat owner still tried to defend his boat when a trio of men allegedly robbed him of his alcohol and prawns. A 59-year-old man was sleeping on his charter cruise vessel - Cape Adieu - at Stokes Hill Wharf in Darwin on Friday when he was woken up by a father and his two sons rifling through his belongings at 5.45am. Northern Territory Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen commended the man for fighting back. The alleged thieves boarded Cape Adieu while the boat's owner was naked and sleeping on board . 'Often as you do in the territory, the man was sleeping naked and confronted the offenders in the nude,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Despite his nakedness, the man fought back with his hands. 'The offenders were a little confronted by the naked male. 'You have to admire the [alleged] victim for doing what he did.' The incident happened early Friday morning at Stokes Hill Wharf in Darwin where the trio took alcohol and prawns . Unfortunately, the offenders made their escape after they struck the boat owner in the face with glass bottles. As a result, he suffered lacerations and bruises to his face. But thanks to the public, police were able to catch up with the family of alleged thieves later on the same day after they drove off in a maroon Ford Falcon. 'They came to our attention because they were driving erratically,' Duty Supt Jorgensen said. 'People rang in and we were able to apprehend them at the service station.'

"By . Louise Cheer . Natalie James has launched an investigation into allegations employers are using a requirement of 417 visa holders to attract free labour . With millions of overseas workers expected to flood the labour market in the next five years, experts are concerned this will threaten the job prospects of Australians. The Fair Work Ombudsman says an estimated 2.5 to 3.5 million foreigners will seek employment on Australian shores. It comes as the workplace watchdog launches an investigation into allegations that overseas workers are being exploited by employers. According to ombudsman Natalie James, it is believed local businesses are using the requirement that 417 visa holders must undertake 88 days of work to attract free labour. With more than 128,000 of these working holiday visas issued in the first half of the 2013-14 financial year and the expectation this number is expected to increase, Ms James said it was important the integrity of the scheme be upheld. But experts said schemes like the 417 visa could be used by employers as an opportunity to find cheaper labour costs. University of Technology, Sydney's Sarah Kaine - a senior lecturer in human resources management - said there was a concern that visas used to attract foreign workers were undermining the current conditions and pay of Australian laws in relation to employment. 'Of course there are legitimate needs for a workforce where local workers can’t be found, like in agricultural areas such as fruit pickers, which is a phenomena we not only see in Australia but in the US,' she said. 'The problem is whether these workers are seen as cheap alternatives to Australian workers by employers, and that is where the danger lies with Australian workers.' Ms Kaine also added foreign workers in industries that have no regulations surrounding employees' rights were most at risk of being exploited. 'It is at the lower end of the labour market where concerns are the greatest,' she said. Experts are concerned the job prospects of Australians will be threatened by the millions of foreigners expected to hit our shores in the next five years . 'They have less power to bargain and enforce those sorts of things. 'At least local workers know the local language but with foreign workers, compounded with regulatory issues and cultural issues, it is a recipe for disaster.' During the past two financial years, the Fair Work Ombudsman has received about 2,000 requests for assistance from workers who are on 417 visas, which accounted for one in three requests from all visa holders. Most of these requests came from those working in the hospitality industry - followed by agriculture, forestry and fishing.","Between 2.5 to 3.5 million foreigners will seek employment in Australia .

"By . Emily Crane . Murdered mother Allison Baden-Clay wrote a secret letter to her husband Gerard in the days after she found out about his affair saying that what he had with his mistress was just a 'boy's fantasy'. The letter was found on Allison's computer as police investigated her disappearance in April 2012 but it wasn't shown in court during the 21-day trial that led to Gerard Baden-Clay being sentenced to life in prison for his wife's murder. Allison's letter, obtained by Channel 7's Sunday Night, revealed she felt 'bitter' over her husband's three-year affair with Toni McHugh, a colleague at his Brisbane real estate business, but she was prepared to put the affair behind them. Scroll down for video . Allison Baden-Clay, pictured here on her wedding day, wrote a secret letter to her husband Gerard three days after she found out about his long-term affair with a colleague . 'What you had with her was not real. It was a boy's fantasy with an adrenalin rush every time you were sneaking about,' the letter read, according to the program. 'You were never with her when she had broken sleep for years on end as her children were little and she was breast feeding. You only used her breasts for other f***ing reasons. 'You only saw her when she washed her hair, shaved her bikini line, put her good undies on and was ready for her lover. That makes me bitter.' The mother of three said in the letter the length of the affair was what had hurt most and the fact Baden-Clay didn't have the courage to end it sooner. 'At the depth of deceit I shake my head in complete disbelief as to how you could have thought up so many excuses and told so many lies,' it read. The letter was found on Allison's computer as police investigated her disappearance in April 2012 and detailed what Baden-Clay could do to try and reconcile their marriage . But Allison also wrote of what her husband could do moving forward in a bid to reconcile their marriage, including date nights, flower deliveries and weekends away. 'This is not meant to be a put Gerard down list, neither is it a poor me letter,' the letter read. 'My aim is to start the new year with a fresh start and no longer talk about the affair except in counselling so I wanted to get as much off my chest as I could.' Her list included: one date night, a bunch of flowers and lunch together each week, a Saturday off every month and four weekend trips away every year. Her decomposed body was found lying in a creek 13km away from the family home in Brookfield, Brisbane, in April 2012. 'Where she ended up was not where she deserved to be found,' Allison's friend Linda Ebeling told Sunday Night. Allison's friend Linda Ebeling told the program she had spoken to Baden-Clay at Allison's funeral saying she would give anything for just one more hug . The morning after he killed his wife and dumped her body by the creek, a calm Baden-Clay called 000 at 7.15am to report his wife as missing. As he was questioned by police, Baden-Clay said two scratches he had on his face were from shaving and that the scratches on his body came from a caterpillar.

Passengers on the return trip include Defence Minister David Johnston and his wife, Toni Hodge, along with Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, according to The Sunday Telegraph. Each one-way trip to Perth done by the empty 30-seat RAAF jet costs up to $16,000, but does not include the lavish return trip where ministers and their wives wine and dine on cocktails, boutique beers and restaurant-quality meals. It has been revealed more than $100,000 of taxpayers' money has been spent on flying empty RAAF jets across Australia to pick up senior ministers . On top of that is the cost of rostering on RAAF crew members during the duration of the flights. The Department of Defence calculates the bill for the 'special purpose aircraft' rides amount to six-figure sums, with a round-trip to the nation's capital costing an average of about $25,000, The Sunday Telegraph reported. According to the Department of Finance's Guidelines for the Use of Special Purpose Aircraft, the defence minister has the authority to approve his own flights and those of party members. Mr Johnston can use the aircraft for 'approving authorities and entitled persons to meet commitments associated with their official, parliamentary or political responsibilities, including electorate business'.

"By . Louise Cheer . Attorney-General George Brandis has had a bad day at the office after delivering a 'train wreck' of an interview on Sky News about metadata and the role it will play in the Federal Government's data retention policy. During an interview with journalist David Speers on Wednesday, Mr Brandis struggled to outline the government proposal which would require telecommunication companies to keep track of what customers did on phones and the internet. This data would be logged for two years and would be used by Australian law enforcement, anti-corruption and national security agencies to investigate crimes without a warrant. George Brandis struggled to explain to Sky News' David Speers what data the government would be collecting in a new proposal . Mr Brandis’ appearance on Sky News followed an earlier interview Prime Minister Tony Abbott did with Channel Nine breakfast show Today, where he used a postal analogy to explain metadata. ‘It’s not the content of the letter, it’s what’s on the envelope,’ Mr Abbott said. ‘It’s not what you’re doing on the internet, it’s the sites you’re visiting. ‘It’s not the content, it’s just where you’ve been so to speak.’ Tony Abbott appeared on Channel Nine earlier to also explain what information the government would be collecting as part of its data retention policy . But later the prime minister’s office told The Sydney Morning Herald internet browsing history was not metadata. To add further confusion - after he was repeatedly asked to clarify what information would actually be captured - Mr Brandis told Sky News: 'What you're viewing on the internet is not what we're interested in...what the security agencies want to know, to be retained, is the electronic address of the website that the web user is visiting.' But then he went onto to admit the data collected under the proposal would include the website.

"By . Louise Cheer . The competition watchdog is looking at making it cheaper for Australians to call and text from their mobile phones. On Friday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission released a discussion paper that outlined the options it was considering to drive down the costs of the service. These included determining prices based on those seen overseas or a uniform price for both landline-to-mobile calls and mobile-to-mobile calls. The ACCC is looking at making it cheaper for Australians to call and text on their mobiles . The paper also uncovered huge discrepancies in prices between Australia's mobile call rates and those overseas. It costs 3.6 cents per minute to make a call in Australia. But in the United Kingdom it is more than half that price at 1.455 cents, while in China it costs 0.681 cents and 0.176 cents in India. This discussion paper has come out of an investigation launched in May after it was found mobile operators were charging each other too much to receive calls and texts on mobile phones. It costs 3.6 cents per minute to make a call in Australia compared to 1.455 cents in the United Kingdom . The discussion paper was done to help the watchdog determine a new regulated price for mobile phone costs . ACCC Commissioner Cristina Cifuentes said this meant consumers were paying higher bills or experiencing reduced product offerings. 'The ACCC is now looking to determine how these services should be priced to promote competition in retail markets and benefit consumers,' she said in a statement. 'Competition has led to lower prices and greater choice for consumers for voice calls, and the ACCC expects that greater competition will similarly lower SMS prices.' Since the ACCC started regulating the cost of mobile calls in 2004, prices have fallen from 21 cents per minute to 3.6 cents per minute. It was also noted that the 4G network roll-out would impact on pricing as it would provide a less expensive and more efficient way of sending out data compared to older networks. This paper was done to help the watchdog determine a new regulated price for mobile phone costs.","The watchdog released a paper outlining options to drive down costs .

"By . Louise Cheer . A Queensland family who took advantage of their elderly landlord after he offered them a roof over their heads have allegedly repaid him by trashing his house. The Bickles were living out of their car when Brian Radke decided to give them a second chance by letting them live in his house for $400 a week if they helped fix it up after the Good Samaritan's previous tenants had left it in a wreck. But Mr Radke told A Current Affair his bad luck continued when he discovered the Bickles had left holes in his home's wall and dumped rubbish in the backyard when he decided to take them to court and evict them for not paying rent. Scroll down for video . Brian Radke (pictured here with A Current Affair reporter Tim Arvier) allegedly had his house trashed by a Queensland family . Lloyd and Diane Bickle, along with their son, were evicted from Mr Radke's home after he took them to court for not paying rent . As the cameras continued to roll, Bickle patriarch - Lloyd - became more aggressive with ACA reporter Tim Arvier . 'They never made any attempt to leave the house and to me, I believe, they used the system the way it is to stay in the house as long as they can,' Mr Radke said. But this was not the first time the family had been evicted for not paying their rent. According to A Current Affair, the family were evicted nine months earlier at another home where they caused more than $75,000 worth of damage. It was a similar story to the one experienced by Mr Radke, the Channel Nine program claimed the Bickles owed their previous landlord thousands of dollars and left the house with doors off the hinges, holes in the walls and piles of rubbish strewn throughout the house. 'They then told me it [the problems at the previous home] was a fault of their children, their children had ran amuck,' Mr Radke told A Current Affair. 'It was their fault that they were in the situation they were.' The elderly landlord took them in after he found them living in their car . Lloyd Bickle threatened to 'smash' the ACA reporter's mouth in when he showed up to film his family being evicted . The family claim Mr Radke had agreed to let them live rent-free for six months if they helped fix a bathroom and kitchen . Mr Radke claimed this was the second time tenants had trashed his home . While the Bickles left Mr Radke's house, they were captured on camera by the news program. In the footage, Mr Bickle is seen swearing at reporter Tim Arvier and threatening to 'smash [his] f**king mouth in'. The Bickle patriarch claimed he and Mr Radke had agreed to six months rent-free if he helped fix up the bathroom and kitchen. He called Mr Radke a 'lying b*****d' when the landlord denied it. 'These dodgy landlords pull this s**t all the time,' Mr Bickle told A Current Affair. 'I haven't trashed the house. 'This house is a f**king dump...[we lived here] because we had nowhere to go.' Mr Radke is now trying to recover the Bickles alleged unpaid rent through the courts.

"By . Louise Cheer . and Lucy Thackray . The best suburbs to invest in each state have been revealed, and you will be surprised about where they are located. In some cases, the percentage of rental return is up to 18 per cent. According to real estate agents, the suburbs' popularity comes down to its close proximity to larger centres and its ties to the mining boom. Venus Bay - just over two hours away from Melbourne - led the pack in Victoria with a 18.53 per cent return on housing, while Killcare was the best place to buy in New South Wales with a return of 16.33 per cent, according to Your Property Investment magazine. A house in Killcare on New South Wales' coast has a return of 16.33 per cent . Venus Bay on Victoria's south coast had the highest rental return with 18.53 per cent . Real estate agent Kerrie Ryan, from Ray White Killcare Peninsula, said the coastal town was a perfect place for families looking for a holiday home because it was a stone's throw away from Sydney. Killcare is just over an hour's drive away. She said in the past 12 months were investing in the luxury of a holiday home close to Sydney. 'If husband needs to go back to work et cetera, he can duck off and mum and kids can stay, then he can come back,' Ms Ryan told Daily Mail Australia. 'Permanent rental properties don’t traditionally get a big yield in this area, but holiday prices do range considerably. 'Properties range from 800 a week to 6,000 a week.' The best places around Australia that have the highest rental return in each state . Ms Ryan said a lot of people were using their investment homes as a holiday rental property business. One of the families who saw the value in a holiday home in Killcare were the Marcells from Sydney. George Marcells' family have had their property on Hardys Bay in the town for more than 30 years. 'My parents bought it when we were little kids and we thought we’d keep it for our kids,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It’s close to work and close to Sydney, and you can always pop back up and down. 'It's just about two hours away and especially with kids you don’t have to sit in the car for hours and hours. 'It’s a beautiful area and unspoiled.' Tasmania's Zeehan gave the highest return in the state for investors. Real estate agents say it's because of its proximity to mines . South Australia's Robe is also a good pick for investors, with a return of 14.02 per cent . Investors looking for a place in South Australia should look at Robe, which sees a 14.02 per cent return on houses, and in Northern Territory, Johnston investors get 13.09 per cent. Meanwhile, those across Bass Strait in Tasmania's Zeehan are expected to see the highest return, 13 per cent, on units. Jenayah Hampton, from Ray White Burnie that sells in the area, said these results seen in Zeehan did not surprise her as buying prices were low and rental prices were high. She said the town's ties to the mining industry with the Avebury nickel mine and its proximity to other mines made it attractive to investors. 'Depending on what’s happening in the mines, it [affects] what the markets are doing,' Ms Hampton told Daily Mail Australia. 'With mines going ahead, prices are low and good rental return. 'But [there's] no crystal ball - you can’t predict what will happen next.' Further north, Queenslanders in Smithfield can see a 10.99 per cent return on units and in Western Australia's Kambalda West, buyers can expect 10.19 per cent. In the ACT, Scullin was the best place to invest with a 7.13% return on units.","Venus Bay on Victoria's south coast topped the state with 18.53 per cent .

"By . Louise Cheer . A father has relived the moment he was forced to make the agonising decision to either save the life of his pregnant wife or his unborn child. Faced with such a terrible choice, doctors offered Dean Hutchison one other option - to move them both to Sydney's Westmead Hospital for specialist treatment, but warned him there was only a 50-50 chance of either of them surviving. He took the second option and thanks to the amazing care of doctors - and the fact little Erin, now eight, was a 'born little fighter', both of his loved ones lived. A father has relived the moment he was forced to make a heartbreaking decision to save his unborn child or his wife . The couple's nightmare began in January 2006 when Kim Hutchison awoke feeling 'a bit off'. Unbeknownst to her, she was suffering from eclampsia. They decided to drive to the hospital as a precaution but in a matter of seconds, Mrs Hutchison started screaming in agony in the car. When they arrived at a Baulkham Hills hospital, the expectant mother started having seizures. It was there medical staff asked Mr Hutchison to make one of the toughest decisions of his life. 'The doctors gave me two choices – stay at that hospital and save Kim but lose our baby, or risk moving them to Westmead Hospital to save them both, but with a 50/50 chance that neither of them would make it there,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Hutchinson took the risk and chose to try and save both his daughter and her mother, which presented only a 50-50 chance of survival for both of them . When Erin was born she weighed less than 600 grams, so small and fragile that her dad's wedding ring was too big for her arm . Today, Erin is a healthy eight-year-old and Mr Hutchinson says he is blessed to have both his girls by his side . '[When they told me] I actually did something that I thought only happened in movies, not in real life. 'I fell down and sat on the floor and I thought ""I want both of them to live"". 'I wanted both of them to have a chance, I couldn’t imagine not having either of them.' Finally, Mr Hutchison decided to make the trip to Westmead Hospital. Erin was only 597 grams when she was born at 25 weeks and spent her first few weeks in the world fighting for her life, while her mother was in a coma. 'For three days, I didn’t know whether either of them would make it home,' Mr Hutchsison said. '[Erin] was given only a 5 per cent chance of surviving. When Mrs Henderson was pregnant with Erin she was rushed to hospital with extreme cramps and seizures . She was given a five percent change of survival and spent months in neo-natal care . Mr Henderson, here with Erin at Christmas a few years ago, says the research done by the Children's Medical Research Institute saved his daughter's life . 'It was a heartbreaking percentage to deal with, but she was just a born fighter. 'Imagine a baby so small that my wedding ring could travel all the way up her arm to her shoulder - that was Erin.' It was during this time that Mr Hutchison saw first-hand the benefits of the work of the Children's Medical Research Institute (CMRI) and a short while later he took up a job with the institute as their payroll officer. 'The research CMRI conducts finds direct answers to medical and genetic issues which also assist others researchers in other areas,' he said. 'Several times while I was at the neo-natal intensive care unit, I heard remarks from specialists and doctors about CMRI and the research they did that led to the oxygenation equipment, and the procedures and techniques used to help Erin see again. She needed her retinas re-attaching in the early stages of her life, and thanks to the research doctors were able to restore her vision . Erin's mother was in a coma for the first few days of her daughter's life, but thankfully both pulled through the nightmare . 'Part of the ordeal she was going through meant her retinas were detaching, without CMRI's research, it would have been unavoidable. 'They helped make some breakthroughs in those areas and led to a better result for Erin being able to maintain her vision.' Mrs Hutchison was able to leave hospital 10 days later, but it was a tougher fight for Erin. After almost three months in neo-natal intensive care, and a further four weeks in the special care unit, the brave little girl was finally able to go home. To help families going through similar ordeals, Mr Hutchison has asked people to support CMRI by wearing denim on Jeans for Genes Day on Friday to raise money for their research and donate to their cause by visiting www.jeansforgenes.org.au. 'While I’m not connected in a research role, I’m happy to be a part that makes up this team,' he said. 'It’s wonderful to know that these guys are working on such amazing and wonderful things.' Jeans for Genes day is this Friday, August 1 and Mr Hutchinson has urged people to support the worthy cause .","Dean Hutchinson was faced with an impossible decision on January 2006 .

"By . Louise Cheer . A former design school employee accused of leaking details of a $60,000 scholarship to the daughter of Prime Minister Tony Abbott has filed a legal claim with the Fair Work Commission. The Whitehouse Institute of Design's chief executive officer Ian Tudor confirmed to the Daily Mail Australia that an 'adverse action case' by a former employee was to be heard by the workplace relations tribunal. The complaint was filed by the former employee who had been investigated by the school after it was reported Frances Abbott had been given the chairman's scholarship worth $60,636, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Scroll down for video . Frances Abbott was awarded a $60,000 scholarship at Whitehouse Institute of Design in Sydney . Mr Tudor told the Daily Mail Australia the institute was 'confident that the adverse action case is without merit and has no prospect of success'. 'The former employee concerned was subject to an internal disciplinary review and resigned before that review was complete,' he said in a statement. 'Given that the matter is currently before the Fair Work Commission, we will be making no further comment.' In May, it was revealed Mr Abbott's second daughter had won the prestigious chairman's scholarship to the Whitehouse Institute of Design. The school, which has campuses in Sydney and Melbourne, has Liberal supporter Les Taylor as chairman of its board of governors. The institute that awarded Tony Abbott's (pictured) daughter the scholarship has had legal action launched against it through the Fair Work Commission . The former employee of the school who lodged the case was investigated for a student confidentiality breach . The revelations Frances Abbott received the 2011 scholarship caused controversy was it was revealed in May because Mr Abbott did not declared the scholarship on his pecuniary interest register - despite previously declaring other matters relating to his children such as trips, accommodation and tickets to sporting events. Mr Abbott has maintained that he had no reason to declare the scholarship because his daughter won it on merit. A school spokesman told The Sydney Morning Herald that the employee was investigated for a breach in student confidentiality, but did not name the student in question. It was revealed to Fairfax media by a source that it was Frances Abbott.

"By . Louise Cheer . A Queensland police officer used a fake Facebook account to bombard an Aboriginal rights activist with racist taunts. Leanne Rissman - who works in Townsville - hurled abuse at Geraldton's Joyce Capewell on her Facebook page, Boomerang Justice, using the alias 'Anne T Sharia'. When sounded out phonetically 'Anne T Sharia' sounds like 'anti-sharia'. Sharia is the moral code and religious law of Islam. Ms Capewell started Boomerang Justice last year after 20 years of working in the Western Australia prison system and interacting with Aboriginal inmates. The page aims to raise awareness about ongoing Aboriginal deaths in custody. Leanne Rissman was disciplined by the Queensland Police Service after it was found she made racist remarks via an alias Facebook account . On New Year's Day, Senior Constable Rissman referred to indigenous people as 'scum bags' and 'oxygen thieves' after Ms Capewell posted on her Facebook page about Tony Abbott's indigenous advisory council and what role they would play in looking into deaths in custody. 'Get off your a*** get a job and start giving something back to your own and the greater community,' Senior Constable Rissman allegedly posted under the Anne T Sharia alias. 'And while you're at it how about you give you children and dogs a decent existence as well instead of starving and abusing them.' Ms Capewell said the barrage of racist comments continued after she contacted Anne T Sharia to ask her to stop posting the offensive remarks. 'Everything you have is because of the white man, if you hate it so much go back to the Aboriginal empire that existed before we came and saw you all sitting in the dirt rubbing sticks together while Rome was built, China built the magnificent great wall, and the English Spanish and Dutch traded and built empires,' Senior Constable Rissman allegedly wrote. A police investigation was launched into Snr Const Rissman (left) after Geraldton's Joyce Capewell (right) lodged a complaint against her . Ms Capewell told Daily Mail Australia she was so offended by the comments she lodged a complaint with police that sparked an internal investigation into Snr Const Rissman. An official document seen by Daily Mail Australia confirmed the Queensland Police established that the abuse allegations 'were capable of being supported'. 'I felt very horrified and lost faith in the police...[it] kept me wondering if this was the type of people we have working with Aboriginal people in custody,' Ms Capewell said. 'I don’t want this woman dealing with Aboriginal prisoners or any Aboriginal people for that matter.' A Queensland Police Service spokeswoman confirmed an officer had been disciplined in relation to a complaint made by Ms Capewell in January. 'The remarks were considered to be racially offensive and although made by the subject officer off-duty were not consistent with the standards and values of the QPS,' she said. 'In response, the complaint was investigated by a senior officer and found to warrant significant remedial action. 'The officer was subsequently required to undertake a number of training programs relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People race relations and social issues as well as professional practice in the QPS and information security obligations.' Under the alias, Snr Const Rissman abused Ms Capewell through her Facebook page, Boomerang Justice . Daily Mail Australia can also reveal Ms Capewell has been attacked on Facebook by supporters of Senior Constable Rissman since Monday. 'Why don't YOU get your facts straight and stop terrorising a decent hardworking Australian citizen,' one wrote. Another supporter also threatened Ms Capewell with legal action, writing: 'Please don't waste your time on this UNEDUCATED MORON. I hope she has a GOOD Lawyer because she's going to need one.' Senior Constable Rissman is also under investigation for not complying with police standards in relation to the investigation into the bashing death of an indigenous woman named Adelaide Riversleigh, according to The Australian. The 37-year-old died on May 10 after she was allegedly attacked by her partner. A Queensland Police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia she could not comment on the matter because it was currently being investigated internally by the service. A number of Senior Constable Rissman's supporters did not return messages seeking comment on the matter. 'All matters relating to this officer are being investigated by a senior member of the QPS from Northern Region with overview by the Ethical Standards Command,' the police spokeswoman added.","A police investigation found Leanne Rissman had used the alias 'Anne T Sharia' to attack renowned Aboriginal activist Joyce Capewell .

"By . Louise Cheer . An early wedding present came for a devoted royalist in the form of a personalised letter from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge who 'reluctantly' declined her wedding invite. Two months ago, NovaFM producer Georgie Clark - who said she had been obsessed with the royal family since she was young - sent an invitation off to Prince William and Princess Kate asking them to attend her August 9 wedding to fiance Chris Page, 31. Attached to the invitation was a note that read: 'We’re massive supporters of you and followed your trip around Australia. We know that airfares are expensive but we’d love to see you there anyway', Ms Clarke told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Nova producer Georgie Clark (pictured here with Nova's Fitzy and Wippa) received a letter from Wills and Kate who 'reluctantly' declined her wedding invite . On Wednesday afternoon, the 32-year-old got the shock of her life when she received a letter from the royal couple, saying after 'careful consideration to the possibilities' they 'reluctantly feel they have to decline' her invitiation. 'I was so excited. I got it yesterday in the mailbox and I ran upstairs to read it,' Ms Clarke told Daily Mail Australia. 'The envelope is beautiful quality and it has a Buckingham Palace stamp on it and an ER [Elizabeth Regina] on it.' In the letter dated July 10, Claudia Spens wrote on behalf of the Royal Highnesses, saying: 'The Duke and Duchess were extremely grateful for your kind invitation.' 'The Duke and Duchess send you their best wishes, and very much regret having to send you this necessarily disappointing reply,' Miss Spens wrote. Prince William and Princess Kate (centre, pictured here with Prince Harry and sprinter Usain Bolt) wrote they were 'grateful' for the invite . The letter says the Royal Highnesses 'reluctantly feel they have to decline' Ms Clark's invite to her August 9 wedding . Ms Clark said she had been obsessed with the royal family her 'whole life'. 'I did a project in Year 2 about the royals and it kind of grew from that,' she said. 'Wills is the same age as me so we kind of grew up at the same time. The Neutral Bay bride-to-be, 32, also sent an invite to US president and first lady Barack and Michelle Obama . 'I started following Kate when she started going out with Wills.' Ms Clark even had a brief brush with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, during their recent visit Down Under. 'I was standing on the wharf nearby when they visited Kirribili [the Prime Minister's official residence] and I said to everyone else standing near me, ""We're [Will and Kate] not in their eyeline so we’ll have to yell to get their attention"", and it worked,' Ms Clark said. 'They gave us a wave.' When NovaFM breakfast team Fitzy and Wippa got wind that Ms Clark had written to the royals, the renowned radio larrikins decided to extend invites to other celebrities from Andre Rieu to Shaggy. 'We got a reply back from Napoleon Perdis who sent a bottle of wine, and return to senders from Eric Bana and Nikki Webster,' Ms Clark said. 'I was nervous because I thought Shaggy would actually come because he's not doing much these days, but the guest list is finalised now.' Ms Clark said the idea to send the royal couple an invite was sparked by a growing trend in the United States. 'I got the idea from bridal magazines and websites. It’s sort of a trend in the US to invite Mickey and Minnie, and you get a personalised reply back,' she said. 'I actually sent Barack and Michelle [Obama] an invite as well, but I imagine they get a lot of mail so I haven’t received a reply back.' The US president and first lady, Barack and Michelle Obama, were also on Ms Clark's guest list .

This was more than double the amount fired off by people at Wakefield in South Australia, which was the second rudest suburb with 15.5 per cent of their tweets containing a swear word. Mr Jackson's list of swear words included about 1,000 phrases from s**t to WTF. Through his research, the geographical information systems consultant also found other than English, the top five languages people tweeted in across Australia were Japanese, Malaysian, Arabic Indonesian and Spanish. The geographical information systems consultant also found out the top five languages used in Australian tweets were Japanese, Malaysian, Arabic Indonesian and Spanish . During his study, Mr Jackson was able to observe the phenomena of tweeting hotspots and their locations. 'Of the football stadiums I was looking at around Melbourne, like the MCG, there were a lot of profanities being tweeted around them,' he said. 'Up in the northern tip of Queensland at Prince of Wales Island, you can see a smooth line of all these people tweeting and I think this is where people on boats get into range of Australia and can start tweeting.' Mr Jackson said airports and traffic lights were other interesting hotspots. 'Even though you're meant to turn off your phones, there are quite a few people who are still tweeting on the runway and you can see them tweeting things like ""I’m on my way to Bali"" or farewells and stuff,' he said. 'There are also hotspots at particular junctions with traffic lights, where I assume people are tweeting and sharing their locations, and it’s interesting to see that is what’s happening when you shouldn't be on the phone.' Other observations made by Simon Jackson were swearing hotspots around football stadiums as well as tweeting hotspots at traffic lights and airport runways . To collect the data, Mr Jackson used a Twitter function called Streaming API. This function shares the location of tweets. 'Every time you tweet and choose your location, Twitter offers people the chance to listen in while they tweet within Australia,' he said. 'It is typically used for marketing purposes to see what people are saying about a certain brand in certain areas. 'I was able to use this data and plot it out on a map.' To find out language trends, Mr Jackson used the Google Language Detector to translate tweets. Even though, this study was a bit of fun, Mr Jackson said the functions used in this study could be applied practically. 'During the Sydney bushfires, we had a map that looked at real time sources to find out things like what roads were closed,' he said. 'In London, they also use this function to predict events, such as riots, after the London riots happened.' South Australia - of which Adelaide (pictured) is capital - was the state that had tweets with the greatest number of profanities . The Illawarra region was found to be the rudest suburb, with more than one in three tweets coming from the area containing a swear word .","Tweets in Australia were observed between June 2013 to March 2014 .

"By . Louise Cheer . A team of University of New South Wales students have broken a 26-year-old world record for speed, which would make their solar car the fastest electric vehicle to travel 500km on a single battery charge. The car, which was built by Australia's top solar car racing team - UNSW's Sunswift, was able to travel at an average speed of more than 100km/h, leaving the previous world record of 73km/h in the dust. But it is not official yet until the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the world motorsports' governing body, gives it the green light of approval. UNSW's Sunswift solar car racing team set a new world record for speed with their solar car on Wednesday . It has solar panels on top of its roof and hood to charge the 60kg battery inside . The world record was broken on a 4.2km circular race track in Geelong - south-west of Melbourne - in Victoria at the Australian Automotive Research Centre on Wednesday afternoon. The vehicle to smash the record, eVe, was the fifth one built and raced by Sunswift since the team was founded in 1996. One of the professional drivers who was involved in the world record attempt, Garth Walden, relished the rare opportunity. 'As a racing driver you always want to be on the podium and it's not everyday you get to break a world record,' he said. 'I really enjoyed hanging out with the team and being part of history.' The car, eVe, was built and designed by a group of about 60 undergraduate engineers . It took place at a track in Geelong - south-west of Melbourne - in Victoria at the Australian Automotive Research Centre . Professional drivers got behind the wheel to get involved in the record attempt on the 4.2km racing track . Project director Hayden Smith - a third-year engineering student - was jubilant about breaking the record. 'This record was about establishing a whole new level of single-charge travel for high-speed electric vehicles, which we hope will revolutionise the electric car industry,' he said. The last time an FIA world record was broken in Australia was in April 1984 by a production-based, petrol-engine sedan, and the most recent Australian record was set in March 1994 by Rosco McGlashan in a jet-powered vehicle. But the Sunswift team are no strangers to setting records. They have broken records for the fastest solar powered road trip from Perth to Sydney and a Guinness World Record for the fastest solar car. But the Sunswift team - which was established in 1996 - is no stranger to breaking world records . The team has also broken the record for the fastest solar powered road trip from Perth to Sydney . The last time an FIA world record was broken in Australia was in April 1984 by a production-based, petrol-engine sedan . And soon, they hope to take the record-breaking car to the streets of Sydney, expecting to meet Australian road registration requirements within as little as one year and industrial designers from UNSW Built Environment have also been enlisted to rework the car's interiors in preparation for its application for road-legal status. The team believes Wednesday's performance showed it was ready for day-to-day use. Its zero-emission solar and battery storage systems makes it 'a symbol for a new era of sustainable driving'. 'Five hundred kilometres is pretty much as far as a normal person would want to drive in a single day,' Mr Smith said. 'It's another demonstration that one day you could be driving our car.' The solar panels on the car's roof and hood to charge a 60kg battery, but the panels were switched off for the record attempt - meaning the car ran solely on battery charge.

"By . Louise Cheer . The devastated family of MH17 victims Mary and Gerry Menke have described the Victorian couple as polar opposites who were not only loved by each other but loved by everyone who knew them. Breaking their silence through a statement released by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Menkes' family say 'their loss is felt as extensively as it is deeply'. 'Though Mary and Gerry Menke’s lives may have been tragically cut short in the MH17 disaster, they will be remembered by everyone who knew them for the vivacity and spirit with which they lived,' the Menke family said. Scroll down for video . Mary (front centre) and Gerry Genke (back centre) have been remembered by family as vivacious and spirited . 'Mary and Gerry were many things to many people: award winning business owners, adventurous world travellers, and active members of the Mallacoota community. 'They were inseparable partners in everything they did, loyal friends, deeply loving siblings and children, devoted parents to four children and doting grandparents to five grandsons.' The couple ran a successful wild abalone pearl cultivating business, which was unique in Australia. The fledgling family business, MAPA Pearls, had recently received a local business award and was going to be the focus of an upcoming episode of ‘Coast’. After a 'whirlwind romance', the couple were married in Mary's home country of New Zealand and 'rarely spent a day apart'. Following their wedding, they embarked on adventures all around the world - taking them to the African wilderness, diving with whale sharks off Ningaloo and hiking the jungles of Borneo. The Menkes ran a successful abalone pearl cultivating business in Victoria and were inseparable . But despite their travels, home was where their heart really lay in Mallacoota in Victoria's west. Both were united in serving their local community - including sporting clubs, schools and the SES - but in personalities they were polar opposites. 'Mary was a woman as colourful in spirit as she was in appearance,' the Menke family said. 'Her easy smile and laugh were as bright as the shock of blonde curls piled on her head. 'Always the centre of attention and the life of the party, you could hear her coming long before you could see her. 'Her ""Ger"" on the other hand could often be seen sitting quietly to the side with a contented grin on his face and laughter in his eyes. 'Though he spoke significantly less than his adored wife, everyone would stop what they were doing to listen.' The couple died when MH17 was shot down on July 17. They leave behind four children and five grandchildren . Other than each other, nothing was more important to the couple than their family. 'Mary and Gerry were central figures in the large and closely-knit extended family,' the Menke family said. 'They were especially loving and involved grandparents, doing activities with their five grandsons on a nearly daily basis. 'In the weeks preceding their tragic accident, Mary and Gerry had been surrounded by friends and a large number of family to celebrate Gerry’s 70th birthday in France.' Gerry was from the Netherlands, born in Hilversum in 1944, and was one of six siblings who immigrated to Australian in 1953. The 70-year-old's fascination in the ocean from a young age led to a successful and lifelong career in the abalone industry in which he was a diver for 35 years before focusing his efforts on the pearl business. Mary came from Bignell in rural Christchurch and was working in an Australian pub when she met Gerry during her working holiday around the country. The pair were returning to their home in Mallacoota on the doomed Malaysia Airlines flight. Mary and Gerry are survived by their four children - Sara, Brett, Anna and Paul - along with their extended families. The Menke family also sent their deepest condolences to those affected by the tragedy.","The Menke couple leave behind four children and five grandchildren .

When police let Mr Rose off the hook, they took measures to make sure this would not happen again on his return trip home. 'They let me go but told me to call the police line before I leave work so that they don't respond if someone calls on the home journey,' Mr Rose posted. A New South Wales police spokeswoman confirmed a report had been received about the incident. At 7.20am, while the train was pulling into Blacktown station, passengers had concerns about a man wearing a costume with a number of weapons and other paraphernalia. After police arrived they found out the weapons and other paraphernalia were in fact toys. The man was asked by police to put the weapons in a bag to avoid any further confusion from passengers, the spokeswoman said.","Reuben Rose was arrested by police on Friday morning on a Sydney train .

"By . Louise Cheer . A group of Australian golfing buddies have taken on British super group Queen's most iconic hit, Bohemian Rhapsody, in a seven-minute parody littered with sporting references. The clip posted by Nigel Tait on YouTube draws from the original music video, including the easily recognisable opening scene of Freddie Mercury and his band mates in the shadows mouthing the four-part harmony of the song's opening lines. In this re-imagined version, Mr Tait and three of his eight friends kick off the video with: 'Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Four days of golfing and an escape from reality.' Scroll down for video . Nigel Tait and his friends decided to make a golfing parody of Queen's iconic hit, Bohemian Rhapsody . The group of eight golfing buddies take an annual trip touring the Murray River golf courses in South Australia . Keeping true to Queen's original film clip, the use of fading in and out of scenes is seen throughout as well as a solo guitarist playing the famous riff. In another reinvented line, instead of 'Mama didn't mean to make you cry, if I'm not back again this time tomorrow', Mr Tait - who did the vocals and played the instruments - sings 'Mama didn’t mean to make it slice, I’m going back for more lessons tomorrow.' So far the video has attracted more than 20,000 views. With the video, Mr Tait wrote it was a 'culmination of 10 years parody song writing for our annual golf trip to the Murray River courses in [South Australia]'. During these trips, which have happened over 10 years, the group have written Queen parodies . This seven-minute video drew from Queen's original film clip of the song and featured many of the same elements, including a shot of hands playing a piano . The video has so far attracted more than 20,000 views on YouTube . 'It all started with a protest song and after that being well-received, parody songs became an annual feature of the trip,' he said. 'After years of raising the standard of song production, one year we decided to produce a six-song album dedicated to the legendary Queen, titled ""A Day on the Greens"". 'The only criticism of the album was its failure to include Bohemian Rhapsody. I took it on as a challenge.' The parody album, A Day on the Greens, is a take on Queen's fifth studio album, A Day at the Races. The song is littered with golfing references as well as scene incorporating the sports' equipment . The group also released a six-song album of Queen parodies, which did not include this hit .","The video was made by Nigel Tait and his seven other golfing buddies .

"By . Louise Cheer . Police were forced to break up a clash involving angry protesters outside a Sydney Woolworths store who were opposing the supermarket giant celebrating the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. To celebrate the holiday, which began on June 28, Woolies put up ‘Happy Ramadan’ signs across 239 of its stores. The move sparked outrage from some members of the public, prompting the Party for Freedom, a fringe political group, to organise a protest on Saturday. Protesters outside Marrickville Woolworths clashed over the supermarket giant's Ramadan celebration signs on Saturday . There were eight protesters against Ramadan and about 60 people for Ramadan . During the demonstration, eight Party for Freedom members and about 60 pro-Islam protesters clashed outside Marrickville Woolworths on Illawarra Road. Party of Freedom chairman Nick Folkes said the Islamic faith was 'incompatible' with the Australian way of life. 'I don’t know why Woolworths is celebrating a ideology that I think is worse than Nazism,' he said. 'It has brought nothing positive in Australia and you can see what’s happening in the Middle East…it’s just chaos.' A journalist at the protest said the two groups exchanged words for about half an hour . Police were called to the Illawarra Road store about 11am to break up the protest . Party for Freedom was the group protesting against Woolworths celebrating the Muslim holiday . During Ramadan Muslims abstain from food and other pleasures during the daylight hours for a month with the idea it will purify the soul and refocus their devotion to God. A New South Wales police spokesman said no one was injured during the protest, but Mr Folkes claimed it was 'really ugly and almost turned into a riot'. '[Pro-Islam protesters] attacked us and came around the corner so fast,' he said. 'We had about 10 people and they had 60 people. They stole one of the burkas, flyers and placards, and punches were thrown and it was very heated.' Mr Folkes also claimed the pro-Islam protesters had weapons but a police spokesman said there were no reports to confirm weapons were seized. Peter Boyle - a journalist who witnessed the clash - said: 'There was a bit of pushing and shoving, but I didn’t see anyone throw a punch let alone draw out a knife'. Boyle said the pro-Islam protesters were there before the anti-Islam protesters arrived. 'There were about three metres between the two sides,' he said. 'There was probably half an hour of shouting at each other and people left. 'It was broken up very quickly by police...[they] didn’t even close the road.' The 'Happy Ramadan' signs have been up since June 28 (left) and have caused a stir in the community with some people for (right) and against them . The group's chairman Nick Folkes said the ideology was 'incompatible' with the Australian way of life . Boyle said the pro-Islam protesters were wearing scarves around their heads. 'I didn’t see anyone of any Middle Eastern background,' he said. 'They were sort of young inner city anarchist types. 'Some of them had things around their face so I couldn’t even see their faces, but they were white Australians.' The police spokesman said they were called to the Woolworths in Marrickville at 11am on Saturday to a group of protesters causing a disturbance outside the supermarket. He said no one was injured or arrested. A Woolworths spokesman said it would continue to celebrate religious and cultural festivals. 'Woolworths is a proud Australian company and we have been so for 90 years,' he said. 'Our customers and our staff mirror the diversity of Australian society. 'We are a strong and active part of the communities in which we operate. 'We join with our customers to celebrate not only Christmas and Easter, but also other religious and cultural festivals including Ramadan, Diwali, Lunar New Year, Chinese New Year and Passover. 'We look forward to continuing to celebrate these festivals with our customers.'","Police were called to the Marrickville store, in Sydney's inner west .

"By . Louise Cheer . Former US presidential candidate John McCain has urged the Prime Minister not to invite Russian president Vladimir Putin to November's G20 summit in Brisbane. The prominent US senator told The Australian on Wednesday from his office in Washington DC that he believed Mr Putin's alleged involvement in July 17's MH17 tragedy - where a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down - should warrant the leader being treated as an 'international pariah'. When asked if he thought Mr Putin should be allowed to join his counterparts at the G20 summit in Brisbane later this year, Mr McCain replied: 'I certainly don't think so.' John McCain has urged Prime Minister Tony Abbott not to invite the Russian president Vladimir Putin to November's G20 summit . Making his position clear on who he thought caused the deaths of 298 people on-board the doomed flight, Mr McCain said Mr Putin was 'totally responsible'. This comes after Mr Abbott indicated on Tuesday that it was still too early to consider if Russia should be turned away from the summit. He said on Monday Russia must show genuine remorse and regret over the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight - his strongest hint yet that President Vladimir Putin could be barred from this year's G20. But Treasurer Joe Hockey said he hoped Russia would still be attending the Brisbane event. Mr McCain has urged Tony Abbott (left) not to invite Vladimir Putin (right) to the G20 summit in Brisbane . Mr McCain believes Russia is behind the shooting down of MH17 on July 17 . Mr Hockey said no one knew where the fallout from the downing of MH17 was going. 'The Russians have said they will co-operate with all this - let's find out if they are fair dinkum or not,' he told Sky News while he was an official visit to New Zealand. Mr Hockey also added the decision about Russia's attendance would ultimately be made by G20 members, not just Australia. Later he clarified his remarks, saying they should not be taken as support for Russia's attendance at the summit. A spokeswoman for the treasurer told AAP that the Treasurer's position was consistent with the Prime Minister's. Queensland Premier Campbell Newman said Mr Putin would not be welcome at the G20 conference unless he co-operated with a probe into the MH17 disaster. 'If Mr Putin's not prepared to do that, well frankly I believe that Queenslanders don't want him here at the G20,' Mr Newman said on Saturday as flags across the state flew at half-mast to mourn the residents of the state who died in the crash.","John McCain said the Russian president should be treated as a 'pariah'

"By . Louise Cheer . Michael Murphy received at least 10 calls from a Commonwealth Bank representative who was offering him money not to do an interview with A Current Affair . A Commonwealth Bank subsidiary has been accused of trying to prevent a victim of its financial advice scandal from speaking out by allegedly offering him money to keep quiet. Michael Murphy had agreed to an interview with Channel Nine's A Current Affair two weeks ago to tell all about his ordeal, when the bank's subsidiary lost tens of thousands of dollars of his life savings by investing it in high-risk products. But on Wednesday, the 79-year-old claimed he had been harassed by an employee of Financial Wisdom - a subsidiary of CommBank - in a bid to stop him from talking. The latest accusation levelled at the bank and Financial Wisdom comes after both were involved in a financial advice scandal, which dated back to between 2003 and 2012, and involved some financial advisers transferring their clients' life savings into high-risk investments and giving poor advice. In some cases, it has been alleged they were forging the signatures of clients to transfer to products that generated more profit. It is thought the dealings had lost millions of dollars for 12,000 customers. Mr Murphy invested $125,000 with Financial Wisdom - but later found out that amount had dwindled to $9,000. After the senior citizen had been interviewed by A Current Affair over his experience of the scandal, Mr Murphy suddenly got a call from a Financial Wisdom representative. The program's reporter, Dan Nolan, heard recordings of about 10 phone conversations with the pensioner over the course of a few days. Recordings of the calls were made without Mr Murphy's permission . The bank refused to hand over tapes of the exchanges to A Current Affair, but the program believed one of the calls which lasted for three minutes had two minutes missing. Speaking about the calls he had with the Financial Wisdom representative, Mr Murphy said: 'It was just harassment and it went on all day, continually getting calls: ""Have you called A Current Affair yet? Have you pulled out of A Current Affair yet?""' Mr Murphy told ACA that in one conversation, that may not have been recorded, the representative asked him: 'How much would it take for you to withdraw from A Current Affair?'. 'They were offering me an inducement not to go ahead with the interview,' he said. Mr Murphy said the woman offered him a financial incentive for his silence after he lost more than $100,000 in savings with Financial Wisdom . The subsidiary of CommBank recorded the calls without Mr Murphy's permission, but two minutes of one phone call has gone missing . Earlier this month on July 3, the bank's CEO Ian Narev apologised for CommBank's mishandling of fraud and misconduct allegations . Mr Murphy claimed he called the woman back and named his price. He said she replied with 'Oh, well, I’m actually out of the office right now and I’ll get back to you tomorrow'. 'And I thought, well, she’s going along with me. She’s not saying, ""We’re not in the business of offering money,"" she’s going along with me,' Mr Murphy said. The next day the pressure on Mr Murphy to kill the ACA story ramped up. In one of the calls, it was alleged by Mr Murphy that the representative said: 'I thought you emailed [ACA] not to go ahead with that interview until we’ve discussed further? If you tell them you don’t want to proceed with the program, they won’t proceed.' Mr Murphy said he told her he needed a good reason not to go ahead and wanted an offer. The representative allegedly replied: 'Things don’t move that quickly. We will reopen your file and look at it again and I will be back in touch with you today. If you don’t want to proceed with that interview, you are perfectly within your rights to tell them.' But a Commonwealth Bank spokesperson said allegations it tried to offer money to a customer was 'purely fanciful' But Commonwealth Bank has denied its staff had tried to offer anyone money in exchange for silence. 'We strongly deny ACA's allegation that the Commonwealth Bank offered an incentive not to appear on the show. This is purely fanciful,' a bank spokesperson said in a statement to ACA. 'Our priority is to ensure Mr Murphy's case is fully investigated and resolved. We are continuing to work with Mr Murphy to ensure he is happy with the management of his case and that we reach a fair and appropriate outcome under the Open Advice Review program,' they said. 'In this instance, Mr Murphy's case manager, with whom he has been working with for some months, was out of the office on annual leave, so to ensure accurate notes were taken to assist in resolving Mr Murphy's complaints, recorded some of the calls. 'Although this was done with the right intention, it is not standard practice and the case manager should have asked for Mr Murphy's permission to record the call. 'We have apologised to Mr Murphy and have explained the unusual circumstances.'","Michael Murphy, 79, agreed to go on A Current Affair two weeks ago .

"By . Louise Cheer . A youth leader said Malaysia Airlines' disasters were the wrath of Allah for its flight attendants' uniforms (pictured) A Malaysian youth leader has been slammed after he suggested the MH17 tragedy was God's punishment for the airline serving alcohol on-board. The leader of the youth off-shoot of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, Ahmad Tarmizi Sulaiman, said the airline had provoked Allah's wrath 'in the bellies of the planes' because it mocked Islamic rule. 'In serving alcohol [which is prohibited by Islam] and the dressing of [MAS flight attendants] which cross the boundaries of Islam,' Mr Sulaiman told independent online newspaper Malaysiakini. His comments come just six days after Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile over the Ukraine-Russia border. At the same time, Mr Sulaiman expressed his party's condolences for the victims of the crash and their families. But he said the party felt that it was time the government and the airline looked at the tragedies plaguing the airline as springing from 'the element of God and his creation', and its failure to fully embrace the teachings of the Koran. 'Flying in a MAS plane does not give passengers the feeling of an airline operated by a country which organises the annual Koran recital competition and in fact, even winning the competition,' Mr Sulaiman said.

Malaysian Chinese Association youth deputy secretary-general Tee Hooi Ling said Mr Sulaiman's remarks were to 'gain cheap publicity from the deaths of 298 people aboard MAS Flight MH17'. 'It is disgraceful that he is insinuating that this tragedy is a punishment from God against MAS for serving alcohol and allowing its crew to wear Malaysia’s traditional costume which he deems as indecent dressing,' she said in a statement. 'Time and time again PAS has always seen women as a scapegoat to be blamed for many crimes, thus causing disrespect for womenfolk and the creation of restrictions against women rights, but to blame a woman’s uniform for what happen to Flight MH17 is pushing things too far.'","Ahmad Tarmizi Sulaiman says Malaysia Airlines mocked Islamic rule by serving alcohol .

"By . Sally Lee . and Louise Cheer . While working behind-the-scenes with celebrities may be a dream job for some, Penny Hunt says being a stylist isn't as glamorous as it seems. The mother-of-one, who's been in the fashion industry for 14 years, has worked with the likes of Asher Keddie, Chris Hemsworth, Deborra-Lee Furness, Heath Ledger, Ian Thorpe, Lara Bingle, Melanie Lynskey and Missy Higgins, Rachael Taylor and Teresa Palmer. The list is endless. Ms Hunt, whose own style has evolved from being the Carrie Bradshaw of Sex and the City to classics and comfort, shared some of her favourite shoots and her personal experiences as a celebrity stylist. 'I really love working with Jessica Marais [from Packed to the Rafters],' Ms Hunt told Daily Mail Australia. 'She’s got it all going on. She’s beautiful, a lovely person, down-to-earth and very fun to work with. She is is such a warm and humble star and has the beauty of an old Hollywood glamour. Ms Hunt made particular mention of a Sydney shoot where she had the chance to work with loved-up Marais and her beau James Stewart. 'It was an amazing shoot and the two had just gotten engaged,' she said. 'Working with the couple was so easy and it helps that they're both so gorgeous.' Celebrity stylist Penny Hunt has worked with a long list of celebrities . Ms Hunt loved working with actress Jessica Marais (left) and her beau James Stewart (right) at a shoot in Sydney . Model Jennifer Hawkins pictured at Uluru in Australia's Northern Territory . While other highlights of her career including being flown around the world by Louis Vuitton to work on their shoots, one of Ms Hunt's memorable location is Australia's very own Uluru in the Northern Territory. 'I've done shoots there a few times and I've got to say that it's just breathtakingly beautiful,' she said. So working on set with glamour model Jennifer Hawkins was no exception. 'It was a phenomenal shoot but it rained half the day - we couldn't believe it,' Ms Hunt said. 'We were standing in the desert and thought ""what the hell is going on?"". But in the end, that shoot stands out for me because I got to see Jen in a different manner compared to all the other commercial campaigns she's done and I've worked with her for such a long time.' However working on such shoots comes with its demands. 'It's so much fun but it's definitely not glamorous,' Ms Hunt said. 'On a day-to-day basis, I'm either running around in my Havaianas or Converse and trying to visit 50 different places to grab everything I need for the shoot. 'By the end of the day I'm frazzeled, my hair is crazy and I'm dirty. Overall it's a demanding job and the hours are pretty long.' Cate Blanchett and husband Andrew Upton were described as a 'power couple' by Ms Hunt . Actress and model Teresa Palmer photographed at Sydney Airport . Ms Hunt also speaks very highly of Aussie actress Kate Ritchie, who's pictured at NSW's south coast . Model Lara Bingle pictured in Sydney . And now comes a new challenge - being a mother. 'It's also the best job I have ever had,' she laughed. 'But in terms of styling the most challenging would be hands down dressing footballers like the All Blacks and Wallabies only for the fact they have huge thighs, broad chests and shoulders and some it's almost impossible to fit unless its custom made.' Ms Hunt's most star-struck moment would have to be the time she met the late Heath Ledger. 'It was when he was filming Candy and the shoot was for an international magazine cover story,' she said. 'He was such a soft and humorous man with this clear, gleaming skin because he hadn't been in the sun to look more in character. 'He chatted openly with all the crew and sat around at lunch like he was an old friend from school - cheeky, handsome and charming.' But her most admirable celebrity and style icon is Cate Blanchett - whom Ms Hunt had the chance to style along with husband Andrew Upton. 'When you grow up admiring someone and then have the chance to work with them, even if it is only playing dress ups for a shoot, it's perplexing,' she said. 'Cate is clearly a stunning woman and so talented but she is also such a style icon with a natural sophistication it was - in a lovely way - slightly intimidating. 'I hadn't met Andrew prior to that shoot and was blown away at his ease and comic charm - the power couple!' Award-winning actress Asher Keddie at Balmoral Beach in Sydney's north shore . Aussie actor Chris Hemsworth known for his main role in Thor . New Zealand-born actress Melanie Lynskey in the Hollywood Hills in LA . Australian singer-songwriter Missy Higgins . Ms Hunt, who originally aspired to be a broadcast journalist but left university when she was offered a job as a beauty editor at Vogue in 2000, considers herself very lucky. 'I didn't think I would end up being somewhat of a celebrity stylist but I'm very grateful,' she said. 'There's a lot of unglamorous parts and it does give you the real insight that celebrities are as normal as anyone. It's just a job.' Now that she has her 16-month-old son, Ms Hunt 'frivolous' spending days are over and opts for classic black, white and grey colours. 'I'm also big on comfort and I love wearing jeans, a T-shirt with a cashmere jumper and a beautiful handbag,' she said. While Ms Hunt plans to continue her future in styling, she also hopes to get back to writing and journalism. And her main styling tip: 'Don't try and be something or someone you're not.' 'I think looking good in what you wear comes from feeling confident and comfortable so it should fit well, suit you and your lifestyle,' she said. 'It's like seeing pregnant women or new mums trot around in sky-scraper heels, maybe with the exception of Victoria Beckham who somehow pulls it off. It's dangerous and so impractical. Or wearing a micro-mini in the middle of winter out to a bar - it's bad for your health and looks the opposite of sexy. 'There's nothing wrong with trying new looks or having fun with fashion but stay true to yourself about what works.' Penny Hunt is represented by Lizard Management & Production, Sydney.","Penny Hunt has worked in the fashion industry for 14 years and has styled a lost list of international and national celebrities .

"By . Louise Cheer . Almost 60 per cent of workers are failing to meet the requirements of their job within the first two years of being employed. New research released by The Search Party - an Australian recruitment technology company - found 56 per cent of employees hired were not meeting the occupation's demands after two years at a company. It also found that 50 per cent of employers were compromising on candidates because their existing hiring processes were too lengthy and 54 per cent could not get someone who met the job specifications. A new survey has found 56 per cent of employees hired are not meeting the demands of a job two years after joining the company . One of the study’s respondents said despite knowing a candidate was being dishonest about their experience they still hired them because they were desperate for a hire. The study was commissioned by The Search Party, but was carried out by independent researcher PureProfile in June. It surveyed more than 500 Australian managers across a variety of industries - including finance and banking, information technology, local government, engineering, media and hospitality. The research also showed almost half - 44 per cent - of the recruitment processes took more than two months, having a significant impact on business productivity and efficiency. 'The lack of an effective process to solve Australia’s recruitment headache is impacting all organisations – they are making do with sub-optimal talent,' The Search Party CEO Ben Hutt said. 'Bad hires have a huge impact on the productivity of a business and at a macro level, we know productivity in Australia has been falling since 2007, which just isn’t sustainable.' The study also found the top method used to seek out candidates was through online job websites, like Seek (pictured), with 56 per cent using this process . Mr Hutt said to combat the issue uncovered by the research, organisations needed to change their approach to the hiring process. 'For too long the market has made do with a broken process and it’s time we addressed this head on,' he said. 'A 2013 PWC study of CEOs revealed that 77 per cent of firms are currently changing their talent strategy in response to this issue, so the appetite is there for change. 'We believe collaborative approaches, which combine best of breed recruiters, with verified, high calibre candidates, backed by a reliable and effective technology platform are likely to be the winners in this race. 'The market is now very competitive, so organisations need to evaluate and rethink their strategies and the tools they use to attract candidates in high demand.' But it seems managers already know they have to change their hiring strategies, with 70 per cent believing they should spend more on solving the issue. However only one in five were willing to increase their budgets over the next 12 months.

An Australian woman, who lost both of her legs in the 2005 terrorist bombings in London, will contest a seat on an Adelaide council. Self-described peace actionist Gill Hicks will stand as an independent for Unley council in November, saying she is keen to make a difference to her community. The affluent area of Unley is located in Adelaide's inner south and according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics has a population of almost 40,000 people. 'I'm up for new challenges in life. It's my community, it's where I now call home,' Ms Hicks told ABC radio on Tuesday. 'I absolutely feel passionate about what I can be doing to, pardon the pun, step up and say, ""OK, through my experience, what can I contribute?"".' Ms Hicks, who has received an MBE, been the subject of documentaries and is a sought-after motivational speaker, says she feels no specific need to be a campaigner on disability issues. On July 7, 2005, Ms Hicks was standing just one passenger away from Jermaine Lindsay, 19, when he detonated a bomb in a train carriage on the Piccadilly line between King's Cross and Russell Square stations. She was one of the survivors of the terrorist attacks, which killed 52 commuters on three trains and a bus. Ms Hicks was on a train on the Piccadilly line when Jermaine Lindsay detonated a bomb on her train carriage, just one passenger away . Ms Hicks was taken to St Thomas's Hospital and at the time was referred to as 'One Unknown' before her identity was discovered. The same name became the title of a book she penned herself about the tragedy and her recovery process after the bombings. Ms Hicks was the last victim found alive at the devastating wreckage and her heart stopped twice while she was being transported to hospital. Things did not look good for Ms Hicks when she lost 75 per cent of her blood, with doctors thinking she would die. After the bombings, Ms Hicks gave up her successful career in design and founded the charity MAD for Peace. MAD (Making A Difference) promotes peace in its books, films and events.

A 16-metre southern right whale, which has enthralled watchers off Sydney's beaches this week, has given birth to a 'big bouncing baby' and is spending the night with her newborn calf in Sydney harbour. Experts have confirmed the birth after the mother and calf were first spotted off Dee Why Beach on Friday morning. 'Mother whale and not so tiny calf bunkered in for a chilly night in the safety of Sydney Harbour,' the NSW Office of Environment & Heritage then tweeted on Friday evening. 'Big bouncing baby': The southern right whale with her newborn calf, spotted off Queenscliff beach, northern Sydney on Friday . 'We found her at 7.30 this morning and followed her and her calf down to South Curl Curl, before she moved out,' said Shona Lorigan from the Organisation for the Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia (ORRCA). ORRCA tweeted a photo of the family on Friday morning to announce the arrival of the calf: 'We now have a big bouncing baby whale!!' Its members had been on whale watch since dawn and had last sighted the southern right in the dying light of Thursday evening a mere 40m off Turimetta Beach. Pregnant: The southern right whale resting as she prepares for the birth of a calf at Warriewood Beach, NSW . The 16 metre whale has enthralled watchers off Sydney's beaches this week .

The mother and calf have since moved to the harbour and experts are still warning the public to steer clear of the family. Sydney ferrys travelling from Manly to the city centre slowed down as they passed the mother and baby on Friday evening. Passengers were overjoyed to catch a rare glimpse of the mother and baby whale, who were being watched over by a boat belonging to the Office of Environment & Heritage. 'A protective mother with a calf by her side will charge at people,' an ORRCA spokesperson told AAP. An Office of Environment & Heritage boat is guarding the whale and her baby in Sydney harbour .

On Thursday, speculation about the birthing whale drew crowds of onlookers down to Warriewood Beach to catch a glimpse of the mammal just beyond the breakers. Just 50 metres off the shore, the mammal treated spectators to an up close look as it swam up and down the southern end of the coastline as well as lifting its barnacle-covered head to taste the sea breeze. Southern right whales are known for their love of the shallows and can often be seen lolling in the waters just behind the surfline.

"By . Louise Cheer . The loot from robbing two teenagers was too sweet to resist for an Adelaide thief. Just days after a new Krispy Kreme store opened in West Croydon - north-west of Adelaide - a man threatened the pair with a knife and took their six boxes of doughnuts from a car parked on Malcolm Street, which is right around the corner from the franchise. About 9.40pm on Wednesday, the suspect demanded the victims to remain in the car while he opened the back passenger door and stole the doughnuts that had been purchased minutes before from the Port Road business, and ran off. Two teenage boys were robbed at knife-point of their Krispy Kreme doughnuts in Adelaide's north-west . Neither of the teenagers were hurt in the robbery and the thief did not demand anything else. South Australia police describe the man as Caucasian, about 165cm tall, between the ages of 16-20 years old, and he was wearing a black-hooded jumper and black trackpants. The man was last seen running south on Malcolm Street. Inspector Kevin Lawton told Nine News Adelaide that the robbery was a very serious offence. 'Anybody that is threatened with a knife and property taken from them - it is quite traumatic for them,' he said. The pair were in a car about 9.40pm on Wednesday on Malcolm Street, just around the corner from the store . More than 1,000 people queued up for Monday's opening of the first Krispy Kreme store in Adelaide . A SA police spokesman said they were investigating a number of leads. 'They are from information that has been received from the public and witnesses,' he said. The robbery comes after the Krispy Kreme store - the first for Adelaide - opened to popular demand on Monday. Nine News reported more than 1,000 people had queued up to be some of the first people to get their hands on the store's famous glazed doughnuts. Krispy Kreme's Mark Higginbottom said he hoped the incident had not put the teenagers off the delicious treats. '[Doughnuts] are best shared but it's best shared without any aggression and violence,' he told Nine News. 'I'd certainly like to see them and do my little bit to make them feel a little better if that's possible.' Police urge anyone with information about the robbery to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report online sa.crimestoppers.com.au.

"By . Julian Robinson . A medal-winning Commonwealth Games weightlifter headbutted a Welsh competitor after a row over 'physical contact' with his victim's girlfriend. Australian Francois Etoundi assaulted Gareth Evans, also a weightlifter, in the athletes' village on Wednesday morning, Glasgow Sheriff Court heard. The incident unfolded after Mr Evans' girlfriend and a number of other people had congratulated Etoundi, 29, for winning a bronze medal by 'physically taking hold of him'. Scroll down for video . Francois Etoundi, pictured, leaving court in Glasgow where he was ordered to pay £400 compensation to Gareth Evans . Gareth Evans suffered an 'uncomplicated fracture to his nose' after being assaulted by Francois Etoundi, the court heard. He is pictured in action in the men's 62kg category at the Commonwealth Games . Procurator fiscal depute Stuart Fauré said Etoundi was staying in the athletes' village at the time of the incident. He told the court there was a lead up to the assault around 4.45am in the morning of July 30 when Mr Evans and his friend Sonny Webster - a weightlifter for England - were in the 'mess hall' having breakfast. Etoundi went into the hall and asked Mr Evans to go outside for a fight but Mr Evans ignored him and carried on having his breakfast. Mr Fauré said: 'The accused left the dining room. At approximately 5.30am that same morning the complainer and Mr Webster left the dining room and whilst they were walking through the athlete's village they came across the accused, Mr Etoundi. 'Mr Etoundi was in the company of some others. It's said that Mr Etoundi approached Mr Evans and headbutted him to his face, in fact the blow struck Mr Evans on his nose. Francois Etoundi won a bronze medal in the men's 77kg weightlifting competition in the Commonwealth Games. But trouble brewed after Gareth Evans' girlfriend congratulated him for the result, the court heard . Etoundi, pictured, had gone to an athletes' village restaurant where he was congratulated by a number of people including Mr Evans' girlfriend, who 'physically took hold of him', the court heard . 'The incident was in relatively short compass. Mr Evans said it was totally unprovoked. The accused made off from the scene.' Mr Evans was described as having an 'uncomplicated fracture to his nose' and given painkillers. Police later detained Etoundi and as they did he said: 'Yeah, yeah, I understand, I'm cool man.' He later made no reply when charged by the police after being interviewed. Mr Hunter, defending, said that Etoundi was originally from Cameroon but lives in Australia with his girlfriend. He had won bronze on July 29 in the 77kg category of weightlifting. He said his client had gone to the restaurant where he was congratulated by a number of people including Mr Evans' girlfriend, who 'physically took hold of him'. The lawyer told the court Mr Evans 'didn't appear to be greatly impressed by the physical contact between the two and words were exchanged'. Etoundi headbutted Gareth Evans while he was walking through the athletes' village, pictured . He said they went their separate ways until later when they met again, when words were exchanged  and the assault took place. Mr Hunter told the court his client has had his accreditation taken from him and is unable to take part in the closing ceremony. Sheriff Andrew Cubie ordered Etoundi to pay £400 compensation to Mr Evans. He told the athlete: 'I sense from Mr Hunter you yourself are disappointed in your conduct, you should be.' Toilets for disabled visitors to the Commonwealth Games have been destroyed in a deliberate fire that caused £50,000 of damage. Twelve portable loos at Prospecthill Road in the Toryglen area of Glasgow were set alight at about 5am. Police Scotland detective constable David Hardie, from Glasgow city centre CID, has appealed for witnesses to the 'sickening' crime. He said: 'The portable loos were placed there for disabled guests who were attending the Commonwealth Games at Hampden. 'Alternative arrangements will now have to be put in place. It is sickening that mindless individuals carry out this sort of crime with no regard for the consequences.' Mr Hardie said the area was relatively busy at the time with people visiting the nearby 24-hour Asda store and drivers who may have seen the fire. He said: 'I would appeal to anyone who was in the area and saw anyone at or near the Portaloos to come forward.' Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101. The sheriff added: 'You have chosen to bring the law of the playground into the athlete's village. You fell out with someone about a girl and headbutted him. It's totally unacceptable behaviour.' Speaking outside court Australian Commonwealth Games chief executive Perry Crosswhite said: 'Absolutely, I'm disappointed. We're disappointed in any athlete who doesn't abide by the rules and goes off the rails a bit.' He also said: 'The behaviour of our people has to be exemplary.'","Francois Etoundi headbutted Gareth Evans in athlete's village in Glasgow .

"By . Julian Robinson . The number of people taking in a lodger has almost doubled over the past few years as people look to supplement their income, according to a new study. Research by insurance firm LV= found that the average spare room generated more than £3,000 rental a year, rising to more than £4,000 in London. A survey of 400 UK homeowners revealed that a fifth of lodgers are aged between 36 and 50. The number of people taking in a lodger has almost doubled over the past few years as people look to supplement their income, a survey has found (file picture) Around 2.7 per cent of homeowners rent out a spare room, compared with 1.4 pre cent in 2009, said the report. The cheapest rooms for lodgers are in the Midlands and North West at just over £2,400 a year, the research found. Rooms in Scotland earn £2,882, in East Anglia £2,748, in the North East £2,667 and in Wales £2,611. The average spare room is being let within eight days of being advertised, while one in ten people taking in a lodger have had their property damaged, said the report. And because of the housing shortage and spiraling house prices, lodgers are no longer students but becoming older with the average age now increased to 31. Landlords said getting a good rental income was the main motivation for renting out a room with a third using rent money to help with the bills while a quarter add it to their savings or to have more disposable income. But it is not all plain sailing with one in 12 landlords owed rent by their lodger or a previous tenant and on average being £307 out of pocket. Nearly a third of landlords owed rent said their lodger simply left without paying, while the same proportion said their current tenant never pays on time. The average spare room is being let within eight days of being advertised, the research found (file image) Many landlords admit if lodgers are a friend or family member it was hard to establish a commercial relationship and less than half of all landlords ask for a deposit. The research also found that a lodger can make a home more vulnerable to accidental damage and theft. A fifth of landlords have returned home to find appliances, such as the oven, left on unattended and one in seven has had their belongings damaged. One in six have noticed that windows have been left open while the home was unoccupied, and one in ten said their home was not locked properly. Three fifths of landlords said they don’t always check references and a third haven’t updated their insurance since taking in a lodger, potentially leaving themselves out of pocket should the worst happen. Selwyn Fernandes, Managing Director of LV= home insurance which carried out the survey said: 'While renting out a room to lodgers can be a great source of income, homeowners might be unwittingly invalidating their home insurance, leaving property and possessions at risk. 'All those considering taking in a lodger should vet potential tenants carefully and make sure they have suitable insurance in place.'","More people are looking to boost income by taking in lodger, survey finds .

"By . Julian Robinson . A High Court judge gave the go-ahead for a gravely ill teenage boy to be given potentially life-changing treatment against the wishes of his Jehovah’s Witness mother. The unidentified 13-year-old, known as T, was left facing profound disabilities after he contracted a disease which causes the immune system to mistakenly attack brain tissue. Medics at the children’s hospital where he was treated said he urgently required plasma exchange treatment, described as the 'gold standard' for the condition. A judge at the High Court, pictured, gave the go-ahead for a gravely ill teenage boy to be given potentially life-changing treatment - against the wishes of his Jehovah's Witness mum . However, his mother refused to give her consent because of her religious beliefs, meaning the hospital had to apply to the High Court for an order dispensing with her permission. In a ruling earlier this month, but only now published, family judge Mr Justice Cobb said it was in the child’s best interests that the treatment go ahead. 'I recognise the powerful competing consideration prevents T’s mother, by virtue of her adherence to the tenets of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, from consenting to the treatment which I am invited to authorise,' he said. 'I recognise, and respect, the exquisitely difficult conflict with which the mother herself must be wrestling: trying on the one hand to be faithful to the tenets of her religion but facing the quite dreadful prospect of her son’s deteriorating health. 'In my judgment, and taking account of the risks advised, and the views of his mother, I am nonetheless clearly of the view that it is in T’s best interests that he should receive this treatment.' The court heard the boy had been suffering with flu-like symptoms and was suspected to have tonsillitis, but his condition deteriorated rapidly. Various treatments were attempted, but with 'regrettably limited effect', said the judge. At the time of the hearing on July 17, he was being fed by tube and was only intermittently awake. However, medics had managed to explain to him during one of his periods of wakefulness what was intended. 'When asked for his view as to the use of plasma exchange treatment, T is reported to have nodded his head in agreement with a ""thumbs-up"" to go ahead with this treatment,' said the judge. He said the unanimous view of the boy’s medical team was that plasma exchange, which filters out harmful anti-bodies from the blood plasma, was the best form of treatment for him.","High Court Judge gave go-ahead for treatment for gravely-ill teenager .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . U.S. health authorities have eased safety restrictions on an experimental drug to treat Ebola, a move that could clear the way for its use in patients infected with the deadly virus. Canadian drugmaker Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp. said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration modified a hold recently placed on the company's drug after safety issues emerged in human testing. The company has a $140 million contract with the U.S. government to develop its drug, TKM-Ebola, which targets the genetic material of Ebola. But last month the FDA halted a small study of the injection in adults to request additional safety information. Tekmira said Thursday the agency 'verbally confirmed' changes to the hold that may allow the company to make the drug available, although it has yet to be proven as safe and effective. Scroll down for video . Breakthrough? Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp. said the FDA modified a hold recently placed on the company's Ebola drug after safety issues emerged in human testing . On the rise: Tekmira's stock was rising on Friday morning, the day after the company announced the modified hold . Two Americans diagnosed with Ebola recently received a different experimental drug called ZMapp, made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. of San Diego. It is aimed at boosting the immune system's efforts to fight off Ebola and is made from antibodies produced by lab animals exposed to parts of the virus. TKM-Ebola helped four Ebola-ridden monkeys four years ago and 'worked to protect them from the disease,' Bloomberg.com reported. The U.S. aid workers were first treated in Liberia. And while the FDA must grant permission to use experimental treatments in the United States, it does not have authority over the use of such a drugs in other countries. The FDA's move Thursday comes amid an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that health officials warn could sicken more people than all previous outbreaks of the disease combined. More than 1,700 people have been sickened in the current outbreak, which began in March. Nearly 1,000 have died, according to the World Health Organization. Currently, there are no licensed drugs or vaccines for the deadly disease. Several are in various stages of development, but none have been rigorously tested in humans. Treatment: Currently, there are no licensed drugs or vaccines for the Ebola virus . The FDA in March granted Tekmira 'fast track' status for its Ebola drug, a designation designed to speed up approval of high-priority drugs by granting companies extra meetings with FDA scientists. Early studies of TKM-Ebola in monkeys suggested it could block high doses of the Ebola virus. But on July 21, the company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, announced the FDA had halted a small dosing study of the drug in 28 healthy adults. The company said regulators had questions about a type of drug reaction that can cause nausea, chills, low blood pressure and shortness of breath. Tekmira's CEO Mark Murray praised the FDA for modifying the restriction on Thursday. 'We have been closely watching the Ebola virus outbreak and its consequences, and we are willing to assist with any responsible use of TKM-Ebola,' Murray said in a release. 'The foresight shown by the FDA removes one potential roadblock to doing so.' FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Yao said she could not confirm the company's announcement since FDA regulations bar the agency from disclosing information about experimental drugs. She did note that the agency places clinical holds on studies based on the risks and benefits to patients. Patients in the Tekmira study were healthy volunteers. On Friday, Tekmira's stock opened at $16.52. As of this writing, stock prices increased to $19.80.","Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp. has a $140 million contract .

"By . Lillian Radulova . and Louise Cheer . and Aap . A 15-year-old soccer player died on Saturday from a suspected cardiac arrest on the pitch after teammates and spectators tried desperately to revive him. Teenager Mark Arcuri, who played for the Austral Soccer Club's U16 team, collapsed during a game near Liverpool in Sydney's south-west. The details surrounding the incident still remain unclear, with one report claiming the boy collapsed after heading a ball on the field, while another says he warned his coach that he felt unwell after running off the field, and collapsed shortly after. It is also unclear at this stage if the boy had sustained an injury during the early afternoon game or if he suffered from a pre-existing medical condition. A 15-year-old soccer player died on the field at WV Scott Memorial Park (pictured) on Saturday after suffering from a cardiac arrest . The group that runs the league Mark played in is Southern Districts Soccer Football Association (SDSFA). Association president Andy Favaloro told Daily Mail Australia a team mate's mother who worked as a nurse, tried to revive the boy by issuing CPR. Mr Favaloro said Austral Soccer Club president Kevin Campbell also tried to help Mark, who was playing against the Liverpool Olympics under-16 team. 'Kevin knows [Mark's] family well and went to hospital with him,' Mr Favaloro said. 'The children who were playing were distraught. 'We were distraught ourselves to hear this had happened.' A bystander performed CPR on the boy before paramedics attended the scene and took him to Liverpool hospital . Mr Favaloro said a minute's silence would be observed before each SDSFA game on Sunday in honour of Mark. Friends of Mark took to Facebook to pay tribute to the teenager. 'May God be with his family during this really tough time they are going through,' Jason El Hawzi wrote. 'R.I.P to Mark Arcuri. Another life lost on earth, but another Angel gained in heaven.' A spokesperson for Ambulance Service of NSW confirmed that a bystander performed CPR on the boy before paramedics attended the scene. Paramedics rushed the teenager to Liverpool Hospital after attempting to stabilise him at the scene. Inspector Steve Corry of Green Valley police told Channel Seven some of the boy's teammates had joined his parents at Liverpool Hospital. 'It's distressing for anyone to lose a young man at that age,' Insp Corry said. A hospital spokesperson told the Daily Mail Australia at about 4pm on Saturday that the boy had died. The SDSFA’s Club Secretary, George McCulloch, told the Daily Mail that counciling is being organised for all the children who witnessed the incident.","Mark Arcuri, 15, played for Austral Soccer Club in Sydney's south-west .

"By . Ben Spencer . and Zoe Szathmary . People decide how trustworthy strangers are within the blink of an eye, psychologists have found, and it is all down to their facial features. We tend to judge someone with high eyebrows and prominent cheekbones to be more honest, while we are less likely to trust someone with a furrowed brow and sunken cheeks, researchers at New York University suggest. The findings give new weight to the principle that first impressions count - even if all it's down to genetics. Scroll down for video . Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon  (left) has high eyebrows and cheekbones, while news anchor Brian Williams (right) has high cheekbones . Psychologists at the university found that a section of the brain decides a person’s trustworthiness even before we have consciously perceived who they are. There is no evidence, however, that facial features demonstrate how honest someone really is – simply that they may be perceived to be trustworthy or untrustworthy depending on their looks. The brain takes just 33 milliseconds - three hundredths of a second, or a tenth of a time it takes to blink - to decide whether someone is to be trusted. The study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, suggests that our brains are set up to be instantly wary of people we decided we should not trust. Jonathan Freeman, assistant professor at New York University’s Department of Psychology, said in a release: ‘Our findings suggest that the brain automatically responds to a face’s trustworthiness before it is even consciously perceived. ‘The results are consistent with an extensive body of research suggesting that we form spontaneous judgments of other people that can be largely outside awareness.’ Applying the findings to public figures, comedian and talk show host Jimmy Fallon and entertainment news journalist Maria Menounos indeed have high cheekbones and eyebrows. Former US president Richard Nixon (left) and Russian president Vladimir Putin (right) have sunken cheeks . Study: Researchers presented these real and computer-generated faces so subjects could evaluate their 'trustworthiness.' Conversely, public figures who have been roundly condemned for their dishonesty or behavior – including convicted killer Scott Peterson and former LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling  – have sunken cheeks and furrowed brows. The New York research team presented a panel of ten volunteers with 300 computer generated faces, and asked them how trustworthy each was. Those faces with high cheekbones, high eyebrows and a smile were perceived to be the most honest. The scientists also presented the panel with real pictures of strangers, and the same facial attributes were found to be deemed as trustworthy. In a second set of experiments, a new set of 37 volunteers were presented with the ‘trustworthy’ and ‘untrustworthy’ images for a split second, while their brain activity was monitored. The images were then immediately replaced with a neutral picture so the brain could no longer process the previous image. The scientists found that a region of the brain called the amygdala, which is vital in social and emotional behavior, activated within 33 milliseconds even when the images were flashed up just momentarily. Former LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling has a furrowed brow and sunken cheeks, making him seem untrustworthy. Entertainment journalist Maria Menounos, however, has high eye brows and prominent cheek bones, making her seem trustworthy . Actress and human rights activist Angelina Jolie (left) has high cheekbones, while convicted killer Scott Peterson (right) has sunken cheeks . Faces with the high eyebrows and prominent cheekbones prompted activity in a different part of the amygdala than faces with furrowed brows and sunken cheeks. Dr Freeman said: ‘The findings suggest that we can assess another person’s trustworthiness from their face extremely rapidly and without conscious awareness, and that the amygdala plays an important role in this process. ‘One possibility is that faces that appear more untrustworthy and likely to inflict harm, or faces with stronger trustworthiness cues in general, are spontaneously tracked by the amygdala, so the amygdala could then quickly alter other brain processes and coordinate fast, appropriate responses to people --- approach or avoid. ‘This tracking would be especially pronounced for untrustworthy faces, who might inflict harm, which is consistent with what we found.’ Dr Bessam Farjo, a British cosmetic surgeon who specializes in hair transplants, including eyebrows, said: ‘The study’s findings are fascinating and further emphasizes that we do make first assumptions which are not necessarily based on our experiences or what information we have been exposed to.'","New York University psychologists  found people judge trustworthiness on features .

[around 2pm] and told us that the gazelle started to run to opposite ends of its . enclosure and charged at its gate three times.' 'The . other gazelle [in the exhibit] was completely undisturbed,' Wiley said, and 'was oblivious to what the other gazelle was doing.' The director of Topeka Zoo, Brendan Wiley, said he thought the gazelle may have been 'spooked' Another gazelle in the exhibit paid no mind to Raul's death, Wiley said . 'We asked the visitor that was here ""Did you see anything? Did you hear anything?"" and the answer was no.' 'We were a little curious - it sounds as if something spooked this gazelle,' Wiley told MailOnline. 'We looked at the animal for signs of snake bites or [signs of a sting] - there wasn't anything,' he said. The necropsy, he said, showed nothing strange apart from Raul's broken neck. Results from tissue examples should come between 10 and 14 days, he said. Wiley said gazelles like Raul are at risk in their native Africa because of hunting and lack of conservation money. It's the second rare gazelle to die at the Topeka Zoo, where a 3-year-old Addra died of a sudden illness in December 2012.

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . Staffers were evacuated from the American embassy in Libya on Saturday and sent to Tunisia safely, officials said. 'All embassy personnel were relocated, including the Marine security guards who were providing security at the embassy and during the movement,' Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement Saturday. 'The embassy staff was driven in vehicles to Tunisia,' he said. 'During movement, F-16's, ISR assets and an Airborne Response Force with MV-22 Ospreys provided security.' Kirby said that 'The mission was conducted without incident, and the entire operation lasted approximately five hours.' Scroll down for video . Evacuated: The entrance to the US embassy in Libya in seen here in a May 13, 2009 file photo. Staffers and Marines were evacuated on Saturday morning and taken to Tunisia . Violent: Embassy staff escaped unscathed from the attack which occurred this morning. In this photograph from Saturday, fighters from the Islamist Misarata brigade fire towards Tripoli airport in an attempt to wrest control from a powerful rival militia, in Tripoli, Libya . The battle for control of Tripoli's international airport began two weeks ago when Islamist-led militias launched a surprise assault on the airport, under control of rival militias from the western mountain town of Zintan.  On Saturday, the U.S. evacuated its diplomats in Tripoli to neighboring Tunisia and shut its embassy . Smoke rises in Tripoli on Thursday July 24 . An unnamed US official told ABC News a that a destroyer - which was not mentioned in Kirby's statement - was another possible resource. When asked about the number of evacuees, a State Department official told MailOnline 'We do not discuss exact numbers for security reasons.' However, ABC News reported 'there were about 150 Americans that were taken out in the convoy, with more than 80 of them being Marines,' citing its unnamed source. Tom Saunders, a spokesman for US Africa Command, told MailOnline that 'There were two MV-22s deployed from Naval Air Station Sigonella, Italy. The MV-22s belong to the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force Crisis Response (SP-MAGTAF-CR) element located at NAS Sigonella. 'The main component of the SP-MAGTAF-CR is located at Moron Air Base, Spain. A portion of the SP-MAGTF-CR matinains a [presence] at NAS Sigonella to be prepared to protect U.S. personnel and facilities on U.S. installations in north Africa. '[One] MV-22 carried one a quick response team of approximately 24 U.S military forces personnel, and the second carried a 2-person medical team. Three Air Force F-16s from Aviano provided air support. And an Air Force KC-135 from RAF Mildenhall, the UK, provided refueling support.' Saunders told MailOnline he was not aware of a destroyer, but said 'it’s not unusual for U.S. naval assets to be in that region during operations or training exercises.' State Department spokesman Marie Harf said in a Saturday statement the evacuation occurred '[d]ue to the ongoing violence resulting from clashes between Libyan militias in the immediate vicinity of the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli.' American personnel at the Tripoli . embassy, which had already been operating with limited staffing, left . the capital around dawn and traveled by road to neighboring Tunisia, . according to Harf. 'We are grateful to the Government of Tunisia for its cooperation and support,' Harf said. As the evacuation was underway, residents of the . city reported in real time on social media that American military . aircraft flew overhead while U.S. soldiers escorted a convoy of vehicles . out of town. The State Department would not confirm the evacuation . until all staffers were safely in Tunisia. The withdrawal underscored the Obama administration's concern about the heightened risk to American diplomats abroad, particularly in Libya where memories of the deadly 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in the eastern city of Benghazi are still vivid and the political uproar over it remain fresh ahead of a new congressional investigation into the incident. 'Securing our facilities and ensuring the safety of our personnel are top department priorities, and we did not make this decision lightly,' Harf said. 'Security has to come first.  Regrettably, we had to take this step because the location of our embassy is in very close proximity to intense fighting and ongoing violence between armed Libyan factions.' Danger: An airplane on the tarmac of the Tripoli airport belches black smoke into the air during fighting between the Islamist Misarata brigade and a powerful rival militia on Saturday . Fighters are seen Saturday trying to fight another militia for control in Tripoli . Support: MV-22 Ospreys, like the one in this file photo, were on-hand during the evacuation, the Pentagon said in a statement . The Pentagon also said that F-16s were involved in the evacuation . The evacuation was accompanied by the release of a new State Department travel warning for Libya urging Americans not to go to the country and recommending that those already there leave immediately. 'The Libyan government has not been able to adequately build its military and police forces and improve security' it said. 'Many military-grade weapons remain in the hands of private individuals, including antiaircraft weapons that may be used against civilian aviation.' The department said embassy operations will be suspended until a determination is made that the security situation has improved, it said. Tripoli has been embroiled for weeks in inter-militia violence that has killed and wounded dozens on all sides. The fighting has been particularly intense at the city's airport. 'We are committed to supporting the Libyan people during this challenging time, and are currently exploring options for a permanent return to Tripoli as soon as the security situation on the ground improves.  In the interim, staff will operate from Washington and other posts in the region,' Harf said. The evacuated staffers will continue to work on Libya issues in Tunis, elsewhere in North Africa and Washington. The move marks the second time in a little more than three years that Washington has closed its embassy in Libya. In Feb. 2011, the embassy suspended operations amid the uprising that eventually toppled longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. After the formation of a transitional government in July, 2011, the embassy reopened in September. Gadhafi was killed in October of 2011. The Obama administration has been particularly sensitive about security of U.S. government employees in Libya since the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. mission in the country's second largest city of Benghazi that killed ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The administration is still fending off criticism from Republicans and others that it did not either enhance security in Benghazi or evacuate the mission due to rising violence in that city in the months prior to the attack. The Benghazi mission was abandoned after that attack and never reopened. The embassy In Tripoli has been operating with reduced staff since but has remained open even as the violence intensified. On Friday, U.S. Ambassador to Libya Deborah Jones appealed for fighting near the embassy to stop. 'We have not been attacked but our neighborhood a bit 2 close to the action,' she tweeted. 'Diplomatic missions 2 B avoided pls.' On Sunday, Jones tweeted about 'heavy shelling and other exchanges' of fire in the vicinity of the embassy and speculation about the potential evacuation had been rife at the State Department for more than a week. A man looks out at smoke on Thursday. American personnel at the Tripoli embassy, which had already been operating with limited staffing, left the capital around dawn Saturday and traveled by road to neighboring Tunisia . Clash: Smoke rises over the Airport Road area after heavy fighting between rival militias broke out near the airport in Tripoli July 25, 2014 . Libya is now witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gadhafi's ouster. In Tripoli, the militias are fighting mostly for control of the airport. They are on the government's payroll since authorities have depended on them to restore order. The U.S. is just latest in a number of countries to have closed down their diplomatic operations in Libya. Turkey on Friday announced that it had closed down its embassy and militia clashes in Benghazi have prompted the United Nations, aid groups and foreign envoys to leave. In Tripoli, clashes near the international airport have forced residents to evacuate their homes nearby after they were hit by shells. On Friday, the official Libyan news agency LANA reported that explosions were heard early in the day near the airport area and continued into the afternoon. The battle in Tripoli began earlier this month when Islamist-led militias — mostly from the western city of Misrata — launched a surprise assault on the airport, under control of rival militias from the western mountain town of Zintan. On Monday, a $113 million Airbus A330 passenger jet for Libya's state-owned Afriqiyah Airways was destroyed in the fighting. The rival militias, made up largely of former anti-Gadhafi rebels, have forced a weeklong closure of gas stations and government offices. In recent days, armed men have attacked vehicles carrying money from the Central Bank to local banks, forcing their closure. Libyan government officials and activists have increasingly been targeted in the violence. Gunmen kidnapped two lawmakers in the western suburbs of Tripoli a week ago and on Friday armed men abducted Abdel-Moaz Banoun, a well-known Libyan political activist in Tripoli, according to his father. An umbrella group for Islamist militias, called the Operation Room of Libya's Revolutionaries, said in a brief statement on its Facebook page on Friday that 'troops arrested Abdel-Moaz over allegations that he served under Gadhafi' and 'instigated rallies against' the Islamists.","The United States shut down its embassy .

"By . Vanessa Allen . Controversial: Damien Hirst's work using live butterflies, In and Out of Love, has been criticised . If you’re an animal lover, he’s already unlikely to  be one of your favourite artists. But even shark-pickling Damien Hirst’s fans might flinch at his latest work. An exhibition by the 47-year-old featuring live butterflies saw more than 9,000 of the beautiful insects die – around 400 a week. Many were killed during the  five-month run after being  inadvertently trodden on or brushed off visitors’ clothing. Thousands more died naturally during the exhibit, called In And Out Of Love, and had to be replaced. Yesterday, animal rights charities criticised the artist, whose works include a shark preserved in formaldehyde and a severed cow’s head. A spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said: ‘Damien Hirst’s quest to be edgy is as boring as it is callous. ‘It does not matter whether Hirst killed the animals himself or sat by while thousands of them were massacred for his own unjustifiable amusement. ‘Butterflies are beautiful parts of nature and should be enjoyed in the wild instead of destroyed for something predictable and unimaginative.’ An RSPCA spokesman added: ‘In this exhibition, butterflies are forced to exist in the artificial environment of a closed room for their entire lives. ‘There would be national outcry if it involved any other animal, such as a dog. Life imitating art: Live butterflies feed from a bowl of fruit in Damien Hirst's installation In and Out of Love . ‘Just because it is butterflies, that does not mean they do not deserve to be treated with kindness.’ Dr Martin Warren, chief executive of Butterfly Conservation, said: ‘It is very sad to hear of the death of so many butterflies. ‘We are very concerned that this work . represents a throwaway approach to living creatures and encourages a . lack of respect for the environment.’ The artwork, shown at the Tate . Modern gallery in London between April and September, was part of a . retrospective of Hirst’s work, which attracted almost half a million . visitors. 'It is very sad to hear of the death of so . many butterflies. We are very concerned that this work represents a . throwaway approach to living creatures and encourages lack of respect . for the environment' Dr Martin Warren, chief executive of . Butterfly Conservation . It used tropical butterflies from the Owl and Heliconius species, which can live for up to nine months in their natural habitat. Those used in the exhibition survived for between a few hours and several days, suggesting their lifespan was shortened. Bowls of fruit, flowers and sugared water were left in the rooms to allow the butterflies to feed. A spokesman for Tate Modern said: ‘The . butterflies used in this work were all... selected from varieties known . to thrive in the conditions created. ‘The butterflies lived out the final . stage of their natural life cycle inside this room. Around 400 . butterflies were introduced to the exhibition over the course of each . week.’ In a statement, Hirst said: ‘A butterfly expert was employed at considerable cost. ‘Perfect living conditions were . replicated and this resulted in many butterflies enjoying longer . lifespans due to the high quality of the environment and food provided.’","47-year-old's work In and Out of Love featured thousands of live butterflies .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . A Michigan man was fatally mauled by two dogs as he jogged along a rural road on Wednesday evening. Craig Sytsma, 46, of Livonia was attacked by the cane corsos in Metamora Township, about 45 miles northwest of Detroit, authorities in Lapeer County said. He was unconscious when he was taken to a hospital, where he died of his injuries, police said. The attack was the third since 2012 involving canines from the same property, officials said. Attack: Two cane corsos attacked Craig Sytsma . Help: A neighbor reportedly witnessed the attack before he tried to shoot at and scare the dogs off . 'He was jogging, doing what everybody else does out there, running and riding bikes,' Metamora Township police Officer Sean Leathers told the Detroit Free Press. According to police, a man mowing his lawn nearby saw the attack, got a gun and tried to shoot at the animals to chase them off. In Michigan, a person may face involuntary manslaughter or other charges in such an attack. The county prosecutor's office is expected to review the case. The dogs, previously identified as bull mastiffs, were quarantined at the Lapeer County Animal Shelter. Sheriff's Detective Jason Parks told the Detroit Free Press the dogs' 45-year-old owner brought them in and authorities will seek to have the dogs destroyed. Sytsma was a 'a divorced father of three' and 'had apparently decided to jog after leaving work,' the newspaper reported. WXYZ reported that Sytsma survived a battle with colon cancer last year. Scene: Sytsma was running on this road when he was mauled by the two dogs . Victim: April Smith, pictured, was attacked by one of the dogs in April 2012 . In May 2012, there was a report of a dog bite where the animal returned to the same property, Metamora Township Police Chief David Mallett told The Flint Journal. And in November 2013, a man was taken to a hospital after being bitten by a dog that returned to the address. Mallett told the newspaper he didn't know whether the same dog or dogs were involved. The dogs 'get loose kind of regularly,' Geoffrey Petz told the Flint Journal. 'I've had interactions where I was walking out of my grandma's pole barn and there was a dog standing there with its hair standing up, growling at you,' he told the newspaper. 'When you get that feeling, you can see it in an animal if it's scared or aggressive and you just back right back into the door.' Oxford resident April Smith told the Free Press, however, that one of the dogs involved on Wednesday attacked her in May 2012. Smith said she and her sister were walking two dogs when she was bitten. She said she was horrified that the owner still had the dogs. 'It's just crazy to me,' Smith told the newspaper. 'Animal control should have done something. It should have never gone this far. The fact this has led to a death, it's sickening.' Some people in past dog attacks in Michigan have been charged. A Livingston County woman whose American bulldogs in September 2007 fatally mauled two people, including a 91-year-old man, was sentenced to prison in 2008. She pleaded no contest to two felony counts of keeping dangerous animals causing death and a misdemeanor charge of allowing her dogs to stray.","Craig Sytsma, 46, of Livonia was attacked by two cane corsos in Metamora Township .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . and Alexandra Klausner . The father of two toddlers who died after a dresser fell on them is facing involuntary manslaughter charges because he heard a crash and didn't immediately check on his daughters, a prosecutor said on Thursday. David Beatty, 28, of Aliquippa, is charged in the deaths of 2-year-old Brooklyn and 3-year-old Ryeley. Brooklyn died shortly after the dresser fell on her on July 4, and Ryeley died two days later in a Pittsburgh hospital. Beaver County District Attorney Anthony Berosh said Beatty was home alone with the girls and acknowledged he didn't check on them for 10 to 15 minutes after hearing the crash. The dresser weighed 124 pounds; the girls weighed about 30 pounds each. Irresponsible?: David Beatty (pictured), 28, of Aliquippa, is charged in the deaths of 2-year-old Brooklyn and 3-year-old Ryeley after he didn't respond to the crash of a dresser falling on them soon enough . Autopsies determined that the weight of the dresser prevented the girls from breathing. 'If the children's caregiver, namely David Beatty, the defendant, would have reacted immediately to the sound of the bang, both children would have survived this incident without significant injury,' a forensic pathologist told police, according to a criminal complaint. Beatty and his wife, Jennifer, 28, face two counts each of endangering the welfare of children because of the 'deplorable' condition of their home, which included dirty bedclothes and diapers and human and animal waste on the floors, walls and beds, authorities said. The couple's attorney, Dale Fouse, said the condition of the house had nothing to do with the children's deaths. When asked to address the prosecutor's allegation that David Beatty didn't respond soon enough, Fouse said, 'The sound was described as a bang. As you may or may not know, children make sounds inside of a house.' 'We can't possibly foresee all of these circumstances,' Fouse said, adding, . 'This looks to be just a tragic accident and it doesn't rise to the level of criminal culpability.' Sisters: Brooklyn and Ryeley Beatty, pictured in matching pink outfits, died after a dresser fell on top of them . Happier times: Brooklyn Beatty who died after a dresser fell on her is pictured here with her mother Jennifer Beatty . Authorities say Beatty gave police various accounts of what happened, first telling them that he responded to the crash within 'seconds' and that he had left the girls alone to play in the room only while he drew them a bath. Later, Beatty acknowledged he had been using the toilet and had waited 10 to 15 minutes to respond. 'He stated that he did not think much about the noise because the kids are always jumping off of beds and making noises,' police wrote in the complaint. The Beattys were released on unsecured bond and will face a preliminary hearing July 31. Beaver County Coroner Teri Tatolovich Rossi told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that 3-year-old Ryeley Beatty died on July 6 at Children's Hospital in Lawrenceville. Victims: Brooklyn Beatty, left, and Ryeley Beatty, right, died after a dresser fell on top of them . Deadly: Authorities were seen removing the dresser at the scene . Ryeley Beatty was taken there on July 4 after the dresser fell on her and her 2-year-old sister, Brooklyn, at their Aliquippa home in Western Pennsylvania. 'The girls appeared to have been playing in or around the bottom drawer of the dresser,' causing it to fall onto them, the paper reported. Joseph Sheppard, who lives in the same neighborhood as the victims, told CBSPittsburgh their father 'said he was running bath water and he heard a boom. And he ran in there and I guess he lifted [the dresser up and brought the girls] outside.' 'I heard their father screaming, yelling,' the girls' next-door aunt Rebecca Beatty told WPXI. 'I rushed over and because I'm a nurse, and I started CPR on them right away [...] so it's terrible.' Authorities were seen lifting the dresser out of the family's home. Brooklyn was pronounced dead on July 6 at a Brighton hospital. Brooklyn died of asphyxiation due to compression of her chest. 'Everybody . who worked that scene... we were trying to console each other and the . mom and dad,' Aliquippa Mayor Dwan Walker told the Tribune-Review. 'I . talked to [the girls' grandfather]...to tell him the whole city was with . him.' A GoFundMe page has been set up to help cover the Beatty family's expenses.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Laboratory tests found that Diet Coke contained 139mg of caffeine per litre, compared to 109mg in regular Coca-Cola . Diet cola drinks contain higher levels of caffeine than regular versions, according to new research. Caffeine is linked to hyperactivity in children, however manufacturers such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi and energy drinks companies are not required to label levels in their products. As a result, families do not realise that apparently healthier diet drinks may contain more caffeine, which can effect behaviour. Laboratory tests found that Diet Coke contained 139mg of caffeine per litre, compared to 109mg in regular Coca-Cola. This equates to 46mg of caffeine in a normal-sized 330ml can of Diet Coke compared to 36mg in a can of regular Coca Cola, according to the research commissioned by the Sunday Times. Diet Pepsi also had more caffeine, with 135mg per litre compared to 122mg in its regular product. The tests showed that caffeine levels also fluctuated in the own-brand cola drinks produced by supermarkets. The Morrisons' version contained the most caffeine, with 124mg per litre, while Tesco's Diet Cola contained the least at 95mg per litre. In December EU rules will come into force that require companies to put ‘high caffeine content’ warnings on products containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre. However, this regime will not cover many cola drinks which fall just below this threshold. Nutritionists and health experts have warned that high-caffeine drinks, often consumed by children, could pose a risk to health and said the test results showed that more needed to be done to safeguard children. Research last year by the European Food Safety Authority found that more than two-thirds of British 10 to 18-year-olds had drunk high caffeine drinks. Energy drinks such as Monster are a particular cause for concern, with some teenagers regularly taking cans in to school in the belief it will make them more alert in lessons or perform better in sports. John Vincent, a government adviser on nutrition and co-founder of the Leon chain of restaurants, has called for better labelling on products and for all highly caffeinated drinks to be banned in schools. Research last year by the European Food Safety Authority found that more than two-thirds of British 10 to 18-year-olds had drunk high caffeine drinks with Monster Energy (right) a particular cause for concern . ‘Energy drinks are effectively another form of drugs,’ he said. ‘The amount of sugar and caffeine in these drinks is in our view is effectively allowing drugs into schools. We don’t do that and neither do we think that should be part of school life. ‘It has a hugely damaging effect on their ability to concentrate, how they feel and it is having health effects.’ Sioned Quirke, a dietician, said: ‘Most parents wouldn't dream of giving their children a mug of coffee but they would easily give them a can of pop.’ Pepsi and Coca-Cola said caffeine was added to their drinks to improve the flavour. A Coca-Cola spokeswoman said: ‘There are slightly different amounts of caffeine in different brands to contribute to their distinct flavour profiles. ‘We clearly indicate the amount of caffeine in our drinks on our website.’","Manufacturers are not required to label caffeine levels in their products .

"By . Dan Bloom . A Team GB skier is applying for a restraining order against a friend’s violent ex-boyfriend whose abuse left her too scared to go jogging. Mark Laidler told Amanda Lightfoot, who competed in the biathlon at this year's Winter Olympics, that he would 'drag her out by the hair' after she stepped in to stop his partner being attacked. The athlete, 27, told magistrates she was nervous to train in the wake of 36-year-old Laidler's thuggish behaviour, which included hitting his then-partner on the head. Scroll down for video . Assault: British Olympic skier Amanda Lightfoot, 27, has spoken out after intervening to help a friend who was being assaulted by her ex-partner. He also threatened to drag the biathlete out of a room by her hair . The assault happened after Ms Lightfoot became embroiled in a domestic row between her friend Hayley Clare, and Ms Clare's then-partner Laidler. He first struck Ms Clare across the head several times after she returned from a night out in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in April. She retreated to the spare bedroom of their shared home in Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, where she texted the athlete and told her what happened. She was treated in hospital for swelling and neck pain, and South Tyneside magistrates heard the concerned athlete visited her friend's home the next day to give her support. Abuse: Mark Laidler, 36, pleaded guilty to two assaults on his ex-partner and one on the skier . When she arrived, Laidler kicked a table at his then-partner and hit her on the right arm. He then told Amanda: 'You’d better shut up or I’ll drag you out by the hair'. Laidler admitted two charges of assault against his former lover and a common assault on the Olympic athlete, believed to refer to his threats. The court heard Ms Lightfoot is now seeking a restraining order  because she regularly goes jogging near her home and was afraid Laidler would approach her. In Sochi Ms Lightfoot became the first female British Olympian in eight years to compete in the biathlon, a gruelling sport which combines cross-country skiing and shooting. In her victim statement to the court, she said: 'When he told me he was going to drag me out by the hair I was terrified he was going to hit me. 'I was shocked at how the defendant was treating my friend and I was shaking but tried to stay calm because Hayley was so distressed.' Christopher Brown, defending, said: 'This relationship was in a nose-dive situation and the tension had been building up. 'My client accepts that he acted in a manner of which he is thoroughly ashamed.' Laidler is due to be sentenced on August 28, when applications for restraining orders will be made. Speaking outside court, Ms Lightfoot said: 'We’re really pleased he pleaded guilty in the end and he accepted what he did was wrong. 'Hopefully we can put an end to this all now and Hayley can start the next chapter of her life.' Her friend Ms Clare added: 'I am so glad this is all over and done with. I just feel I have wasted three years of my life with this person. 'The court proceedings have been awful, but I am glad I went through with it. Rapid rise: Ms Lightfoot only took up skiing at 19 but has already competed in the Winter Olympics in Sochi . 'I am upset by the way and which I have been treated by him, but I have wonderful friends and family and I just want to get on with my life now.' Ms Lightfoot, from South Shields, South Tyneside, contested the 7.5km sprint in Russia earlier this year. The athlete - who has enjoyed a rapid raise after she took up skiing at the age of 19 - placed 71st in the 15km individual event after missing targets on the shooting range. But she was upbeat about her performance, saying she had plenty of experiences to improve her performance for the next Winter Olympics in 2018.

"By . Dan Bloom . Africa's Ebola outbreak is spreading beyond the control of top medics and poses a serious threat to the rest of the globe, the World Health Organisation has declared. Four west African nations have recorded almost 1,800 cases as bodies were left in the streets and at least 961 people have died - including 80 medics. Today the World Health Organisation's director-general declared the outbreak is moving 'faster than we can control it' as it emerged another 29 people have died in just two days. Scroll down for video . Toll: The World Health Organisation has declared a public health emergency over the spread of Ebola in west Africa. Pictured: Liberian Muslims pray over the bodies of two victims of the disease in a photo released today . Deaths: As of Monday the death toll including in Liberia (pictured) was 932. It is thought to have risen since then . Crisis: Liberia (pictured) has declared a 90-day state of emergency and the army has set up road blocks . In the two days between Monday and Wednesday this week there were another 68 cases and 29 deaths, the vast majority in Liberia and Sierra Leone, the World Health Organisation announced today. Of the 1,779 cases, 1,134 have been confirmed in a laboratory while 452 are 'probable' and 193 are 'suspected'. Of the 961 deaths, 622 have been confirmed, 286 are probable and 53 are suspected. After two days of conferences the organisation has issued a warning similar to those which were produced in the swine flu pandemic in 2009 and for a polio outbreak in May. Speaking from the WHO's headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, director-general Margaret Chan said: 'The outbreak is moving faster than we can control it. 'The declaration ... will galvanise the attention of leaders of all countries at the top level. It cannot be done by the ministries of health alone.' Protective clothing: Nurses prepare to remove an Ebola victim's body near the Liberian capital Monrovia . Every head of state must declare an immediate state of emergency, the WHO said, something which has already happened in Liberia with roadblocks stopping traders from moving around the country . She said the announcement is 'a clear call for international solidarity', although she acknowledged that many countries would probably not have any Ebola cases. She added: 'Countries affected to date simply do not have the capacity to manage an outbreak of this size and complexity on their own. 'I urge the international community to provide this support on the most urgent basis possible.' Britain increased its aid pledge to the crisis from £2million to £5million yesterday as the WHO pleaded with western countries to provide immediate help. It also called on the affected nations - Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria - to introduce a clampdown to halt the disease in its tracks. Every head of state must declare an immediate state of emergency, the WHO said, something which has already happened in Liberia with roadblocks stopping traders from moving around the country. Toll: An updated death toll released today by the World Health Organisation, accurate as of Wednesday . Clampdown: The WHO said all airports in the affected nations should introduce health screenings while other countries should have treatment facilities if needed. Pictured is the jet used to fly home two U.S. aid workers . Protection: The Gulf Stream III, complete with an isolation tent, was used to transport Ebola victims  Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol. They were later treated with experimental drugs produced in California . No patients should leave the country until at least 21 days after becoming infected unless they are being removed as part of a medical evacuation under strict conditions. And all airports in the affected nations should introduce health screenings to stop anyone with Ebola-like symptoms from leaving. There is no cure for the disease, which is transmitted by direct contact with blood or bodily fluids of infected people and emerged in 1976. Some victims bleed from the mouth, eyes and ears, meaning the illness can be passed on during ritual burials. Medics are in urgent need of better contamination supplies as it emerged 145 of those infected by the weekend were healthcare workers - 80 of whom died. Deadly: Ebola is transmitted through direct contact with blood and bodily fluids but so far remains in Africa . International emergency: The World Health Organisation says Ebola is spreading faster than officials can conrol it. Pictured is a billboard about the virus in Freetown, Sierra Leone, where troops are on the streets . Ebola emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which gave the disease its name. There are several strains which vary in how dangerous they are to humans, but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent. In the current outbreak that is just over 50 per cent. It is introduced into humans through direct contact with the blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals including fruit bats, which are eaten as a delicacy. Other species thought to have passed on the virus have included chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest. The virus then spreads between humans through direct contact with blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people. Symptoms include fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. People are infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus and the incubation period can range between two and 21 days. Although the disease has no cure, modern medical treatment and quick isolation help hugely to bring the death toll down. Source: World Health Organisation . Yesterday 75-year-old Spanish aid worker Miguel Parajes became the first confirmed case to be taken to Europe for treatment as he was flown into Madrid in an isolation chamber. His condition was described as stable. Experts were divided over the purpose of the WHO's stark statement today as it did not recommend any trade or travel bans. 'I don't know what the advantage is of declaring an international emergency,' said Dr. David Heymann, who directed WHO's response to the SARS outbreak and is now a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. 'This could bring in more foreign aid but we don't know that yet'. Other experts hoped the declaration would send more health workers to West Africa. 'The situation is very critical and different from what we've seen before,' said Dr Heinz Feldmann, chief of virology at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. 'There are so many locations with transmission popping up and we just need more people on the ground.' The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have already elevated their Ebola response to the highest level and have recommended against travelling to West Africa. Two U.S. aid workers were treated using the ZMapp drug, produced by the tiny California firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical, despite it only only being tested on monkeys. It consists of a cocktail of  proteins produced in bioengineered tobacco plants which target the virus. But President Barack Obama has ruled out flying in large quantities of the drug to west Africa because it is too soon too guarantee against serious side effects. Health officials also warned that there are almost no doses available of the drug.

"By . Dan Bloom . Paedophile: Rolf Harris is appealing his conviction . Disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris has begun action to appeal against his convictions for a string of indecent assaults. A spokesman for the Judicial Office confirmed lawyers for the 84-year-old had lodged papers at the Court of Appeal this week. The artist and musician was jailed for five years and nine months after he was convicted of 12 indecent assaults on June 30 at Southwark Crown Court. They included one on an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens and a catalogue of abuse of his daughter’s friend over 16 years. The court will now consider whether to grant permission for him to continue with his appeal bid. If he is granted permission his case will be decided by three High Court judges. Harris, a family favourite for decades, was finally unmasked as a predator who was fixated with under-age girls during his trial. Jurors heard how his 16-year campaign of sex abuse against his daughter’s friend 'haunted' her and made her abandon her dreams as he continued to be adored by millions of fans worldwide. His fall from grace saw him stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed. Now he faces losing his prestigious CBE and the performer’s multi-million pound fortune is at risk from potential compensation claims. Harris was jailed for five years and nine months for the sex abuse, meaning that he is due to serve just under three years for the crimes, which happened between 1968 and 1986. Earlier this week the Attorney-General’s Office confirmed that the sentence would not be referred to the Court of Appeal for being unduly lenient. Attorney General Jeremy Wright decided not to take action despite his office receiving 150 complaints about the term, of which he will serve half in jail. Disgraced: Harris has been stripped of several honours already and faces losing his prestigious CBE . A spokesman said on Wednesday: 'The Attorney General understands that his decision not to refer the case may be a disappointment to some people. 'However, he did give extremely careful consideration to this sentence and he concluded that he could not refer it. 'The sentencing judge was bound by the maximum sentence in force at the time of the offending. 'The judge made some of the sentences consecutive to reach the total sentence, but he could not simply add up sentences on individual counts; the overall sentence had to be just and proportionate to the overall offending.' Prisoners can only appeal against their conviction if they claim the original trial was unjust in some way - for example, if key evidence was omitted, tainted evidence was accepted or the judge did not follow procedures which keep the proceedings fair. A clerk at the offices of Harris' lawyers told MailOnline they would be unlikely to reveal the grounds of appeal at this stage.","Lawyers for 84-year-old lodged papers this week at Court of Appeal .

Players were stunned to see the spectacle of nature's brutality last week in the calm surroundings of Thornbury Golf Club in South Gloucestershire.

As Mr Henniker-Heaton drew his iPhone, the frog - which he had assumed was dead - kicked into life and escaped the snake's jaws. 'I was playing a pairs match against Bristol Golf Club when Philip came running over to see if I had a camera,' he said. 'I lay down on the green and managed to get a photograph of the both the frog’s and the snake’s eyes. 'The frog looked dormant and Philip thought it might be dead, but then I saw its throat move.

Measuring up to 6ft long grass snakes . are the largest species of snake in Britain, but unlike adders they are . not venomous. They pose no threat to humans but they are dangerous to the small animals on which they feast because of their speed and quick reflexes.

The . snakes subsist mainly on amphibious . animals like frogs, toads and newts, as well as the occasional fish. They also have a preference for birdies. Their feelings towards bogeys remain unknown, but are presumably not positive.","Display of nature's brutality came at 17th hole of course in Gloucestershire .

Gallagher, . 40, is in Spain, where he appeared unfazed as he downed cocktails yesterday. He . was drinking a mystery brunette in a black bikini, who stroked . his head as they lay beside a hotel pool in Ibiza. Starting . at 11.30am, the former Oasis frontman drank more than a dozen mojitos . and several tequila shots as he laughed and joked with friends. The previous night his new band Beady Eye had performed at the Ibiza Rocks festival. Afterwards . he was said to have looked ‘happy and relaxed’ as he mingled with . female fans and posed for photographs at Pikes Hotel, a favourite . celebrity haunt in San Antonio, and danced topless on his room balcony, . which overlooks the bar, until 2.30am. Gallagher flew to Alicante yesterday to play at the Benicassim festival. He has . made no public comment on what his spokesman says is ‘gossip’. Gallagher has taken steps to prevent . the story spreading, instructing London law firm Harbottle & Lewis . to write warning letters to newspapers making inquiries about the . singer’s reaction to the claims. He is also reported to have hired a . lawyer in New York to defend himself against a paternity suit brought by . Miss Ghorbani at the Manhattan Family Court. Ready to rock: Liam Gallagher after his band Beady Eye's gig in Ibiza on Wednesday. He has been told not to come home by his wife - for now... She . is  alleged to be seeking £2million. After paying for the medical costs . of the birth herself, Miss Ghorbani began the legal action and arranged . a DNA test for her baby. Gallagher’s . lawyers are taking unspecified ‘action’ against the New York Post for . naming him as the father, but on Thursday it made further claims. A . source told the newspaper: ‘Liza met Liam when she interviewed him and . they began an affair [which] continued until around three months after . the birth of the child. He ended the relationship when she told him she . was suing him for child support. Simpering: The glowing New York Times profile of Gallagher written by . Miss Ghorbani describing how the British singer 'turned heads' at the . Ritz-Carlton . ‘Liza isn’t after millions of dollars, she is simply seeking child support and no amount has yet been set.

McLean, Virginia. Her mother Sylvia, 63 – who was born in Lancashire and moved to America aged 19 – declined to comment. She is a teacher at a local school, while her husband, Iranian-born Daryoush, 65, runs his own mobile home business. Friends claim that Gallagher left it to another family member to break the news of the love child allegations to his mother. A source said: ‘They thought Liam should have done it himself. ‘His family have also advised Liam to see a top lawyer for the court case – and to consult a top divorce lawyer as well. ‘They . are concerned for Liam. They say he’s “chaos” and that they are worried . that he won’t stop his partying lifestyle until he makes himself ill.’ Friends of Canadian-born Miss Appleton . say she never suspected her husband of cheating on her, despite his . history – he already has three children by three women. Two of those . were born during marriage. On stage: Gallagher performed with his band Beady Eye at a hotel in Ibiza this week, just hours after the identity of his alleged love child's mother was revealed an ocean away . Gallagher married his first wife, actress Patsy Kensit, in 1997. But only a couple of months later he fathered a child with singer Lisa Moorish. Their daughter Molly is now 15. Gallagher and Miss Kensit had a son, Lennon, now 13, in 1999. In 2001, Gallagher had another son, Gene, now 12, with Miss Appleton, whom he married in 2008. In the same year, Gallagher boasted he was a ‘top dad’ who had turned his back on a rock’n’roll lifestyle to be there for his family. The singer revealed he had never intended to become a father but insisted: ‘Once you get your missus pregnant, you’ve got to step up to the plate.’","Relative says 'Liam only has himself to blame'

"By . Dan Bloom . Futuristic plans have been unveiled to build Britain's first 'floating village' in the heart of London. The scheme would turn the Royal Victoria Dock, which was an industrial powerhouse for more than a century, into an array of brightly-coloured houses, paths and restaurants on giant concrete 'stilts'. But its unveiling today has sparked a furious row between London mayor Boris Johnson and local politicians, who say it will hasten London's slide into a millionaires' playground. Dramatic: Plans have been unveiled for Britain's first 'floating village' in the old industrial heart of east London . Who would live in a house like this? Each home would be custom-built and perched on top of concrete piles driven into the base of the 160-year-old industrial dock - but there are fears over their high price . The entire 'village' - similar to many in the Netherlands - was described by Mr Johnson as floating but is set to be propped up on concrete piles driven underwater and through the floor of the dock. It's claimed the 15-acre site next to the Emirates Air Line, Boris Johnson's prized cable car which was blasted by his critics as a white elephant, would become a 'thriving community' with 50 homes, restaurants, cafes and bars. Each building would be connected by bridges and there would be a large events venue in the shadow of the nearby 69,000-capacity hall at the ExCeL Centre, which hosted events for the 2012 Olympics. The luxury development would also feature offices, water sports, a floating Lido and even an ice rink. Lead architect Professor Alex de . Rijke, of London's Royal College of Art, designed the scheme after . giving high-profile talks on floating villages in Venice. Multi-coloured: The 'village' would include 50 custom-built homes and walkways, restaurants and bars . Old and new: But the scheme has sparked a row with local politicians who say it is only for the super-rich . It would be similar to a 'floating village' in Ijburg, Netherlands, with each luxury house built off-site and shipped into place. But the scheme has been blasted today as a 'yuppie ghetto' by the mayor of the borough of Newham - which will decide whether to grant planning permission next spring. Sir Robin Wales said: 'We have always been clear that any new . development must provide affordable housing and an acceptable mix of . uses along with much needed long-term jobs for local people. Mayor Boris Johnson said the scheme would host some of London's most sought-after homes . 'The . current plans for the Floating Village do not meet our vision or the . Greater London Authority's own London Plan. 'Newham Council cannot, and . will not, accept a development consisting purely of luxury apartments . which will be out of reach of the majority of our residents.' London mayor Boris Johnson's office was unable to say exactly what percentage of the scheme will be affordable at this stage. But each house will be custom-built to its buyer's demands, raising the price, and the development will be surrounded by 'a blue water square, framed by a market square and a floating corniche.' A spokesman for Mr Johnson insisted: 'The Mayor wants to ensure a significant proportion of low cost homes within this exciting new development, with social housing provider Genesis on board, and a commitment from City Hall to recycle all financial receipts from the scheme back into it for affordable homes and commercial space.' Dug out in the heart of east London near what is now the financial hub Canary Wharf, the Royal Victoria Dock opened in 1855 and was a key part of Victorian Britain's powerful shipping trade. The first of the 'royal docks', it was followed by the Albert Dock and King George V Dock. Together they became the largest enclosed docks in the world and reached their peak in the 1950s. But as Britain's economy radically . changed after the Second World War the docks declined, and by 1978 they . were losing £9million a year. Cargo . gradually stopped being shipped up the Thames and went instead to sites . further downriver including Tilbury in Essex, which is now home to a . gigantic container terminal. As it is now: Opened 1855, the Royal Victoria Dock is now part of the largest enclosed docks in the world. Pictured centre is the vast ExCeL venue, which opened in 2000 and hosted sports for the 2012 Olympics . Dramatic past: Troops unloading the Argentina Star during a strike at the Royal Victoria Dock in 1949 . Chris Brown, the director of Carillion Igloo Genesis, said: 'Living in a floating home you've helped to design is a dream lots of us have. 'By combining the floating home experience of our Dutch collaborators with our custom built business we hope to make these dreams come true in Royal Victoria Dock for a few lucky Londoners. 'East London's place on the tourist trail is growing fast. It's about to be joined by Europe’s largest floating village, with floating markets, creative workspace, events and watersports.' The London mayor added: 'This site has the potential to become one of the most sought after . addresses in the capital while breathing new life back into London’s . waterways.'","Multi-million pound scheme in Royal Docks, east London, to be UK first .

"By . Dan Bloom . Eight puppies have been rescued after they were stuffed into a bin in blistering heat and left to die. The cross-breed dogs' callous owner even dragged the bin into the middle of a country lane near Orpington, Kent, putting the dogs in danger of being hit by a car. A concerned motorist pulled over on Friday and found the pets distressed and suffering from dehydration. Callous: Cross-breeds BonBon, Humbug, Dib Dab, Jelly Bean, Mars, Fudge, Crunchie and Bounty were found dumped in a bin and taken to rescue workers (from left) Sarah Mitchell, Kayleigh Williams and Jamie Cove . 'Roasted alive': A concerned motorist  found the pets distressed and suffering from dehydration . He took them to an animal shelter where they have made a remarkable recovery, and were named after sugary treats to reflect their 'sweet' nature. Staff at Foal Farm Animal Rescue Centre now hope BonBon, Humbug, Dib Dab, Jelly Bean, Mars, Fudge, Crunchie and Bounty can find new homes. Debra Taylor, the centre's manager, said: 'Somebody phoned up. He was quite upset and said . he had found a bin full of puppies and didn’t know what to do. 'We told him to bring the puppies over to us. He turned up with a couple of other guys with the puppies in the back of his car. Care: Kennels worker Kayleigh Williams with one of the rescued puppies . 'When the pups arrived they were overheated and panting. We took them inside and put them in a cool room and treated them.' 'I . can’t believe someone could do something so callous. It was the hottest . day of the year. Just when you think you’ve seen it all something like . this happens. 'They would have roasted alive if someone hadn’t picked them up. 'We are grateful they are safe - even though we’re full to capacity like most animal rescue centres. 'It could have been a lot worse.' The dogs were found at the end of a week which saw parts of the country bask in temperatures of 32C. Sarah Mitchell, kennel supervisor, said abandoned dogs were brought in every week - but this case was particularly callous. 'The bin had been moved to the middle of the road so any passing car would have to stop,' she said. 'We've done some initial investigations but there's no microchips on the puppies so there's not much we can do to track down the owner. 'We had two puppies just the day before. It's more irresponsible breeding than anything else. We've had cases of cruelty where dogs have had mange, losing all their hair. 'When we think about how these puppies were discarded, in heat, in a bin and left to die our hearts sink at the total lack of compassion, kindness and care for animal welfare. 'All people need to do is take these unwanted animals to a rescue where they will be kept safe, secure and be loved by the staff and volunteers and given a chance of life.'

"By . Dan Bloom . The incredible story of a spy who parachuted into Nazi-occupied Europe disguised as a nun has been revealed after she died aged 94. Just before her death Margaret Spencer wrote of her days as a Second World War spy, being shot in the back by a German sniper and caught by the Gestapo. She had been silent for 50 years after signing the Official Secrets Act - and her account was a shock to all but her closest friends and family in her village near Eastbourne, East Sussex. Secrets: Before her death aged 94 Margaret Spencer (pictured on her 21st birthday) wrote of her days as a Second World War spy, being shot in the back by a German sniper and caught by the Gestapo . She finally revealed her life story in memoirs which her family handed to her local newspaper, the Eastbourne Herald, after her death last month. Mrs Spencer said she had been recruited at the start of the . war, given a Colt 45 and instructed to round up German spies and . Communists along the south coast - all while working as a nurse. 'During all these activities my husband was in complete ignorance,' she wrote. 'He just thought I was busy at the hospital. 'Secrecy meant just that, not even your nearest and dearest knew about your double life.' During one of her daring missions she told how she was captured by the brutal Nazi secret police, the Gestapo. Her published memoirs do not reveal how she escaped - but she lived to tell the tale. Margaret Spencer revealed how during one of her daring missions she parachuted behind enemy lines dressed as a nun. In another she was shot in the back by the feared secret police, the Gestapo (file photo) Often referred to as MI6, the Special Intelligence Service (SIS) sabotaged enemy operations throughout the war. Its most famous unit - formerly called Section D - was set up to conduct paramilitary missions overseas. In 1940 Section D became a separate organisation, the Special Operations Executive, and Winston Churchill ordered its agents to 'set Europe ablaze'. Some agents sabotaged the enemy by blowing up trains, bridges or factories. Others tried to subvert occupying forces by encouraging revolt or guerrilla warfare. Although many spies had the famous 'tap on the shoulder' at Oxford or Cambridge, agents also included a former chef, an electrician, journalists and a car dealer's daughter. In another mission, she parachuted behind enemy lines disguised as a nun. After the war she continued working in the intelligence services, including a mission to Russia, before leaving to work as a community nurse and midwife. All the while, she said, she still had the bullet from a German sniper lodged near her spine. But she was only allowed to reveal her secrets in 1995 - and kept her gun until 1977. Mrs Spencer lived in Eastbourne with her husband Len before moving to the nearby village of Westham, where she was choirmaster at St Mary's Church. She was also a keen member of the WI and a local history group. Her daughter Diana Milne, 68, who also lives in Eastbourne, told MailOnline her mother had been involved in several parachute drops - but remained completely humble. 'She was far more proud of what she did in the village than what she did during the war,' she said. 'She was the kingpin of the village and lived in and around Eastbourne all her life. 'A lot of people had contacted the local paper because my mum had given a few talks locally, and there were so many different stories that I decided to let people read what she wrote. 'But she was very private and only told her story within the village. She had an opportunity to publish - someone who taught history at a university wanted to write it - and she said no. Daring: Mrs Spencer was captured by the Gestapo (pictured with commander Heinrich Himmler) 'She only ever wrote three accounts of her life which she put down in letter form to her family.' Her daughter added: 'The parachuting was normal for her and I know the details of the mission when she dressed as a nun, but she would have wanted that kept private. 'She was a wonderful woman, my mum. I'm very proud of her.' Friend Jill Parsons said: 'She was well known in the community and very popular. She came to our local group a few years ago and told us about her time in the war. 'She wasn't one to show off about what she did. She was incredible.'","Margaret Spencer lived a quiet life as a midwife in Eastbourne, East Sussex .

"By . Francesca Chambers . President Barack Obama will meet with average Americans and hold fundraisers for Democratic candidates during his trip to Texas next week, but he will not visit detention facilities at the border housing thousands of illegal immigrant children, the White House said today. Press Secretary John Earnest said the president is 'well aware' of the humanitarian crisis at the border and doesn't need to see it first-hand during his trip to the Lone Star State. 'The president has a very good sense of what's happening at the border,' Earnest said during his daily press briefing. 'He's getting regular updates from his officials who've traveled to that region. They're focused on solving this problem.' 'And what the president wants is ... regular reports about what they're seeing on the border, and how resources that are being devoted to processing these--those who have appeared at the border, are being used to effectively administrate justice. Ain't nobody got time for that: President Barack Obama will hold fundraisers for Democratic candidates for Congress when he visits Texas next week but he doesn't plan to go see the humanitarian crisis on the border . The original impetus of the president's travel to Texas was a pair of Democratic National Committee fundraisers taking place on Wednesday and Thursday in Austin, which is located near the middle of the large southern state. News outlets first began reporting the trip last weekend, and the White House confirmed earlier this week that Obama was in fact planning to appear at political events in the state. The first fundraiser will take place at filmmaker Robert Rodriguez' home. Tickets to that event reportedly cost between $5,000 and $32,400. The next day, Obama will participate in a roundtable discussion with progressive activist Aimee Boone Cunningham, assistant secretary of the Center for Reproductive Rights. Admission to that event is also $32,400. Obama is reportedly scheduled to attend a fundraiser in Dallas on the first day of his trip, as well. Today the president will also participate in another 'Day in the Life' event, in which he meets face to face with someone who wrote him a letter. In this instance, Obama will meet with a Texas resident who sent the White House a message praising the president's economic policies. He will not, however, make a pit stop at the border, Earnest said. President Barack Obama made a surprise trip to tech startup hub 1776 this morning in Washington, D.C. to talk about about job growth and meet with young entrepreneurs . The president's trip 1776 today was the latest in a string of attempts by the president to get out of the White House bubble . Questions about a potential presidential visit to the border first arose during the White House press briefing on Tuesday. Asked whether Obama would visit the overcrowded detention facilities in the Rio Grande area during his upcoming visit to Texas so he could observe the humanitarian crisis with his own eyes, Earnest said, 'At this . point, no,' Earnest said. 'But if there are any changes to the schedule we'll let you . know.' Earnest was again asked about Obama's plans on Wednesday, after Texas Governor Rick Perry invited the president to come visit the border in person during an appearance on Fox and Friends that morning. 'If he doesn’t come to the border, I think it’s a real reflection of . his lack of concern of what’s really going on there,' Perry said. 'If the President of the United States is really . serious about securing that border, we can show him how to do that,' the former Republican presidential candidate said. 'But I haven’t even had a phone call from this president.' On Wednesday Earnest said Obama still had no plans to visit the border but he 'wouldn’t rule it out until the day of.' 'Our focus at this point is to plan . to do something else,' he said. Likewise, Earnest, 'the most important thing' people like Perry could do 'is not offer public . invitations but actually to lend their public support to comprehensive . immigration reform.' The White House official also explained that the president doesn't need to travel to the border because other senior . administration . officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, Health and . Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell and Director of White House . Domestic Policy Cecilia Muñoz, have recently traveled to the border. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest got hammered with questions from reporters today about the president's upcoming trip to Texas and his decision not to visit the border while he's there . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi visited Brownsville, Texas, last Saturday to show her support for comprehensive immigration reform. The president opted not to join her on the trip. Johnson and Burwell were just in McAllen, Texas, on Monday to speak with border patrol . officers and receive an update on the federal government's efforts to feed, clothe, house and treat the overpowering number of unaccompanied minors being held in the area's detention facilities. Last week, Johnson visited illegal immigrant children being held at Nogales, . Arizona, detention centers. 'So this is something that the administration is paying very close attention . to,' Earnest said during yesterday's briefing. 'The President is getting regular updates on this situation.' 'This President is obviously very . attuned to what’s happening at the border,' he said at another point. After a reporter asked if Earnest was 'comfortable with the optics of the President going for fundraisers only and not . taking an eyeball look himself on the border?' Earnest said Obama's trip would 'include some activities other than just building . some support for Democratic candidates for office who are on the ballot in . November.' Obama's trip came up a third time during today's briefing to Earnest's chagrin. The newly minted senior administration official first repeated previous statements about Obama's travel schedule, and then said: 'I think the reason that some people are suggesting the reason the president go to the border when he's in Texas is because they'd rather play politics than actually try to address some of these challenges.' 'If they were committed to solving the problem, you know, for example in the case of the Texas Governor, he could probably be pretty useful, I hear he's a pretty persuasive fellow, that he could pick up the phone, and call up some of those Republican members of Congress from Texas who are standing foursquare against common sense immigration reform,' Earnest said a few minutes later. 'If the governor were genuinely concerned about solving so many of these problems that exist on the border, the most impactful thing he could do right now, is encourage those Republican members of the House of Representatives to stop blocking common sense legislation from coming to the floor of the House of Representatives.' The president's comprehensive immigration reform legislation passed in the Senate last summer, but House . Speaker John Boehner has refused to bring it to the House floor. Boehner . has said that he will not introduce immigration legislation until the . president agrees to a step-by-step approach instead. Texas. Gov. Rick Perry shakes hands with Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Sgt. Johnny Hernandez after touring the McAllen Border Patrol station on Monday . President Obama is one of the only a few high-profile Washington officials who hasn't visited the border since news outlets began reporting on how poorly the unaccompanied minors coming to the U.S. were being treated in detention facilities. Pictures of children sleeping in piles on the floor without mattresses or blankets caused an uproar, and the Obama administration had to act suddenly to resolve the situation. The president announced more than $250 million in new aid to the Central American countries from which the kids are primarily migrating from and sent both Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry to to speak with leaders of Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras about the importance of shutting down the criminal networks that are smuggling children in through the U.S. border with Mexico. On Monday the president announced that he was using his executive authority to direct the Homeland Security to 'refocus' its resources from the interior of the country to its Southern border. The president himself is yet to meet in person with Central American leaders or any of the 52,000 children who fled their home countries to come to the U.S. in the last year. Last weekend House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other members of the president's party made the trek to the border to stand in solidarity with the immigrant children and show their support for immigration reform. Today, members of the House Homeland Security took a field trip to McAllen to hear from Perry and Texas law enforcement officials. During the field hearing, which took place on the campus of South Texas College, Perry asked the government to pay back Texas the $500 million his state had spent since 2005 on border security efforts. 'We have been fulfilling a federal responsibility,' Perry said. 'The hardworking people of the state of Texas shouldn't be . shouldering that cost.' The Texas Governor also called on the president to send 1,000 National Guard members to his state to help secure the border. 'The power of boots on the ground cannot be overstated,' Perry said. 'The message needs to be not, If you come into the United States, . you'll be deported,"" but, ""You won't enter the United States."" ' The president said last week that he would send more border patrol agents to Texas, but he's ignored multiple requests from Republican officials to deploy the National Guard.","President Barack Obama is traveling to Texas next week to attend Democratic Party fundraisers .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Hillary Clinton's second memoir, Hard Choices, has sold a dismal 160,000 copies, data released by Nielson BookScan today indicates. By comparison Clinton's book Living History sold 600,000 copies in a single week when it was released in 2003, leading publishing group Simon & Schuster to believe Hard Choices would be a hit. But sales of the book continue to plummet, and it looks increasingly unlikely bookstores will be able to sell the million hard copies the publishing group distributed to them when the book dropped earlier this month. Who wants to buy one?: Hillary Clinton carries around a copy of her memoir at an Arkansas Wal-Mart during a book signing there last Friday night . From the beginning Clinton's book has struggled to gain the necessary traction to meet the enormous expectations in sales thrust upon it by publishers. Sellers reported . moving only a 85,000 copies the first week it was available in stores. From there, it was all downhill, with the book selling only 48,000 . copies it's second week on the shelf, a 43.5 percent drop from the week previous. Last week the book sold a dismal 26,000 copies. Total sales for the book are unavailable, as recent ebook sales have not been disclosed, but roughly 15,000 digital copies of the book were known to have been bought the first week. When asked about the unexpected unpopularity of Hard Choices, a spokesman for publishing company wrote off the memoir's shaky start. 'It . will be selling for years — in hardcover, e-book, audio and paperback — . and we expect it to be a successful book for Simon & Schuster as . well as our many international partners,' Simon & Schuster spokesman Cary Goldstein told the Washington Post last week. 'Most . importantly, reader reaction has been terrific.' Coming soon to a discount bookstore near you: Publishing company Simon & Schuster distributed a million hard copies of Hard Choices to bookstores, but only 160,000 of them have sold . Initial sales usually account for 30 percent of a book's total sales, . meaning Clinton's book would have needed to sale 300,000 copies in the . first week to stay on schedule. Reader reaction hasn't been quite up to snuff, either. The book has received 1,165 reviews on Amazon and only 276 of them have been marked with the coveted five star label. A large majority of reviewers gave the book one star, with users frequently complaining that the book was a waste of money. 'What . a waste of paper. Or for Kindle/Nook readers, screen space. What was . Simon and Schuster thinking when they paid her? Not profits for sure,' Virginia resident George V. Caylor commented yesterday. 'Too . bad kindle books can't be used for toilet paper. One star is five too . many for this book. Avoid like a plague,' Cornith, Texas, resident D. L. White said of the book on Monday. 'No . matter how you feel about Hillary, this book is boring and very poorly . written. It's not worth reading unless you need something to put you to . sleep,' a user name Richard wrote on June 21. 'This . book was one of the worst books I've ever read. I wanted to like it but . in the end, I ended-up stabbing myself in the face with a fork because . of it. There's nothing new in the book thus simply recycled boredom . all-the-way-around,' said another user on June 21. 'Good God-- most boring thing I have ever . attempted to read. If she had any integrity, she would refund her . advance,' an user named Druanne wrote on Amazon yesterday. Clinton's advance for the book is unknown, however, it is rumored to be north of the $8 million she was paid for Living History. That book ended up selling 1.4 million copies. After traveling across the U.S. to promote Hard Choices for the better part of June, Clinton will travel to Europe later this week for the second leg of her tour. There, publisher's hope her book will see a rebound in sales. 'We can think of no other recent book . written by an American leader to receive such an enthusiastic . international reception,' Jonathan Karp, president and publisher of . Simon & Schuster, said in a statement last week.","Publisher's expected Hillary Clinton's second memoir Hard Choices to sell a million copies or more .
But the book has struggled to gain traction, selling only 26,000 hard copies last week, and just 48,000 copies the week before that .

"By . Francesca Chambers . President Barack Obama's 'flippant dismissal of the Constitution' is 'utterly beneath the dignity of the office,' House Speaker John Boehner said in a op-ed on Sunday explaining why the House is suing the president. 'I know the President is frustrated. I'm frustrated. The American people are frustrated, too,' Boehner wrote on CNN. But that irritation doesn't give the president the right to enact his own laws, the Republican leader argued. 'That's why, later this . month, we will bring legislation to the House floor that would authorize . the House of Representatives to file suit in an effort to compel . President Obama to follow his oath of office and faithfully execute the . laws of our country.' House Speaker John Boehner and House Republicans are taking Obama to court. Boehner is pictured here last month at the press conference . When Republicans took over the House in 2011, the first-term Democratic president and Republican congressman embraced the split party control over Congress and pledged to work together to resolve the issues plaguing the nation. As a display of his willingness to work with and not against Republicans, the president even allowed the newly minted House Speaker to play golf with him, an invite usually reserved for close friends and aides. Boehner and Obama's once friendly relationship has deteriorated throughout the past four years, however, as the president has grown increasingly impatient with the opposing party's reluctance to pass bills addressing his favored issues. With no end in sight to congressional gridlock, and the final term of his presidency nearly half way over, Obama has taken on a more aggressive approach to moving forward his legislative agenda, using executive orders to make reforms when and where he sees fit. The president says he has only used powers afforded to him as the country's executive to make changes to administration policies. Republicans claim only Congress has the authority to make changes to U.S. laws, however, and the president is playing fast and loose with the Constitution. Boehner, left, and Obama, right, were still on friendly terms when the president invited the House Speaker to play golf with him in June of 2011. Their relationship has greatly deteriorated throughout the last two years, however . In a memo to fellow members of Congress last month, Boehner said Obama is in violation of Article II Section III of the Constitution, which says the president 'shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' 'Under the Constitution’s separation of powers principle, only the Legislative Branch has the power to legislate,' Boehner wrote. 'On one matter after another during his presidency, President Obama has circumvented the Congress through executive action, creating his own laws and excusing himself from executing statutes he is sworn to enforce – at times even boasting about his willingness to do it, as if daring the America people to stop him. 'On matters ranging from health care and energy to foreign policy and education, President Obama has repeatedly run an end-around on the American people and their elected legislators, straining the boundaries of the solemn oath he took on Inauguration Day,' the Speaker of the House continued. In response to Boehner's lawsuit the president definitely told ABC's George Stephanopolous, 'I'm not going to apologize for trying to do something while they're doing nothing.' A few days later he mockingly told Republicans who think he's acting outside the law: 'So sue me.' In an op-ed that appeared on CNN's website over the weekend, Boehner took on the president's comment, calling his behavior 'disappointing.' He also defended House Republicans' record, saying they'd passed more than 40 bills aimed at creating jobs that have died in the Senate, along with other House-led legislation. 'I don't take the House . legal action against the President lightly. We've passed legislation to . address this problem (twice), but Senate Democrats, characteristically, . have ignored it,' Boehner wrote. 'There must be accountability,' he said. 'When there are conflicts like this -- between the legislative . branch and the executive branch -- it is my view that it is our . responsibility to stand up for this institution in which we serve, and . for the Constitution.' Boehner's lawsuit is perfectly timed to coincide with a previously scheduled congressional recess that will last from the first week of August through the first week in September. While the president and Democrats are out campaigning against Republican obstructionism, Republicans will be able to use the certain-to-pass suit as proof of the president's malfeasance. Republicans are expected to keep the House after this year's elections, but there's still four months on the clock. The president plans to actively campaign for his party in the coming weeks and is making trips to both Colorado and Texas for fundraising events this week. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has also pledged to come out for Democrats this fall after she finishes her book tour this month. Clinton still enjoys a high approval rating, and candidates who receive the potential 2016 candidate's public support could see a bump in the polls.","President Obama says Republicans in Congress are keeping vital legislation from becoming laws and so he must go around Congress to make reforms himself .
Boehner and his Republican colleagues say the president doesn't have the authority to change laws passed by Congress, and in doing so, he is violating the Constitution .
The House is now suing the president for what it sees as lawless behavior, and the president doesn't seem to care .
The president's nonchalant attitude about the House's suit stuck a nerve with Boehner, and the House Speaker took the president on over the weekend in an op-ed ."
"By . Paul Donnelley . The National Portrait Gallery has a new exhibition of police mug shots with a difference - they are all criminal suffragettes and one of them bears a remarkable resemblance to the Princess Royal. Chopper-wielding Canadian Mary Raleigh Richardson – for she is the royal doppelganger – attacked The Toilet of Venus ( better known as The Rokeby Venus) by Diego Velázquez. She joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), led by Emmeline Pankhurst. On March 10, 1914 she entered the National Gallery in London and slashed the Rokeby Venus with a chopper that she had smuggled into the gallery. Which one is which? The chopper-wielding vandal Mary Richardson and the horse-riding Princess Royal . Velazquez's Rokeby Venus, which was damaged by Mary Richardson with her chopper . The damage perpetrated by Richardson when she attacked the painting with a chopper . Always on for publicity, she had even drafted a press release: ‘I have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs Pankhurst, who is the most beautiful character in modern history.’ Richardson later became the head of the women's section of the British Union of Fascists led by Sir Oswald Mosley. Formed in 1903, the WSPU's first scandal occurred on January 17, 1908, when a group of suffragettes chained themselves to the railings of 10 Downing Street and were arrested. Manchester art vandals: Evelyn Manesta (left) and Lillian Forrester (right) attacked portraits of classically 'beautiful' women on display at Manchester Art Museum . In 1912 the suffragettes started a campaign of window smashing and one of the biggest smashers was Evelyn Manesta and she was arrested and sent to Holloway Prison. On her relase she continued her nefarious activities and in March 1914, as part of a concerted attack on art, she and Lillian Forrester attacked paintings of classically ‘beautiful’ women in the Manchester Art Museum. Look for the woman: 1 - Margaret Scott, 2 - Olive Leared (née Hockin), 3 - Margaret McFarlane, 4 - Mary Wyan (Mary Ellen Taylor), 5 - Annie Bell, 6 - Jane Short, 7 - Gertrude Mary Ansell, 8 - Maud Brindley, 9 - Verity Oates, 10 - Evelyn Manesta . The woman in the case: 11 - Mary Raleigh Richardson, 12 - Lilian Lenton, 13 - Kitty Marion (Katherina Maria Schafer), 14 -Lillian Forrester, 15 - Miss Johansen, 16 - Clara Giveen, 17 - Jennie Baines, 18 - Miriam Pratt . In early 1913, Lilian Lenton and Olive Wharry began a series of arson attacks in London, and Lenton was arrested in February 1913 on suspicion of having set fire to the Tea House at Kew Gardens. Sent to Holloway, Lenton began a hunger strike that lasted for two days before she was force fed. The force feeding caused her to fall ill when food entered her lungs. She was quickly and quietly released. The Home Secretary, Reginald McKenna, denied that she had been force fed and that her illness was actually caused by her hunger strike. Lilian Lenton died in October 1972. She never married. The Government rushed through its 'Cat and Mouse Act' in April 1913, which allowed for the release of hunger-striking suffragette 'mice' to regain their health, when the security forces could re-arrest them. Arsonist Lillian Lenton (left) was force fed while on hunger strike in prison and became ill when food entered her lungs. Margaret Scott (right) Clara Giveen (left) was sentenced to three years' penal servitude for setting fire to the grandstand at Hurst Park; Kitty Marion (right) was an actress in pantomimes and became a militant suffragette when faced with the casting couch. She was sentenced to one month's hard labour for breaking a window in the Newcastle Post Office during a visit by Lloyd George .","Canadian-born suffragette Mary Richardson attacked The Rokeby Venus .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . and Dan Bloom . Three people were injured and London City Airport was forced to close for more than an hour today after a departing plane's engine 'exploded' as it was taking off. A passenger on board Geneva-bound flight LX437 said there was a large bang, flames which 'grew and grew' and 'large chunks of what looked like red-hot metal' flying into the air. He added: 'In about 20 seconds we would have been in the air'. Scroll down for video . Evacuated: Passengers are pictured leaving the Geneva-bound jet, which had to abort take-off . Shock: Passenger Mike Mompi, 28, sent updates from the stricken jet on Twitter after being evacuated . Rebuffed: Mr Mompi rejected suggestions that an 'exploding engine' was a minor technical incident . Three passengers were treated for ‘minor injuries’ and others remained in shock after the incident which caused other incoming planes to be diverted and departing flights to be postponed or cancelled. Passengers posted photos on Twitter of the stricken Geneva-bound Swiss plane being evacuated as 74 passengers and four crew got out onto the runway and sought refuge on the apron. Mike Mompi, 28, who was flying to Switzerland for a ski holiday, said the Swiss International Airlines Avro RJ100 was revving up on the runway for take-off when it happened. He said: 'There was a large bang and flames which grew and grew and large chunks of what looked like chunks of red-hot metal started flying up. 'People started freaking out... In about 20 seconds we would have been in the air.' Mr Mompi added on his Twitter account that the plane was ‘just firing up for take-off on the main runway’ when the explosion happened. He refuted the airport's claim there had only been a 'minor technical incident', saying: 'Exploding engine a minor technical incident?! 20 seconds more we'd been in the air.' Cancelled: The stricken jet blocked the runway at London City Airport and flights were cancelled for an hour . Business: The airport caters for more than 3 million passengers a year, many in financial services (file photo) Mr Mompi, a social impact investment adviser for London firm Impact Investment, said he didn't think anyone had been injured by the engine. He suggested it was more likely they were hurt as people tried to get off the aircraft. Swiss International confirmed that the RJ100 aircraft suffered an engine problem and the pilot aborted take-off. A spokeswoman said: ""The pilot aborted take-off at low speed due to an engine problem. 'Passengers and crew have been safely evacuated.' Air Accident investigators launched an immediate inquiry and classified the incident as serious. The Air Accident Investigation Branch said in a statement: ‘The AAIB have deployed a team to investigate a serious incident (involving only minor injuries) at London City Airport.’ London City Airport said one departing flight was cancelled and four were diverted because of the incident. Probe: The Air Accident Investigations Branch described it as a serious incident with minor injuries . Shock: A passenger said the Swissair flight had chunks of red-hot metal flying into the air (file photo) An airport spokesman said the plane was at the beginning of the runway when the technical glitch caused the plane to become stranded:’It had not  started down the runway to take-off.’ She said: ’The crew ordered the evacuation.’ She could not say whether smoke or a suspected fire prompted the evacuation. Today's incident involved an RJ100 jet, made by British Aerospace (now BAE Systems). Another RJ100 suffered difficulties at London City Airport in February 2009, when a British Airways flight from Amsterdam crash-landed there when one of its wheels failed. The 67 passengers and four crew on the flight were evacuated and paramedics treated four people for minor injuries. The RJ100 derives from the old British Aerospace 146, manufactured by the firm which is now known as BAE Systems. When the hub in Docklands opened in 1987, the 146 was for a time the only aircraft able to use the airport. The RJ100 first flew in May 1992, seats up to 128 people and is still widely-used. The three injuries happened after crew deployed emergency chutes and passengers used them to escape the plane. In a statement airport officials said: ‘London City Airport can confirm that a technical issue occurred onboard Swiss flight LX437, due to depart to Geneva at around 15.00 on Thursday 27 March 2014. 'Seventy-four passengers and four crew were evacuated immediately and three people were treated at the scene for minor injuries by the London Ambulance Service. 'The runway was closed temporarily and re-opened at 16.15.’ On its website the airport noted: ‘The airport runway is currently closed due to a minor technical incident. Flights will be disrupted, passengers should contact their airline for info.’ Later it posted: ‘The runway is now open, but flights may be affected by the earlier disruption.’ London City Airport is smaller than its counterparts Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, but still has more than 3 million passengers pass through its doors each year. Some 250 aircraft a day use the runway, many of them small charter flights or private jets catering to financial workers in the City of London and Docklands.","Engine failed on Geneva-bound jet containing 74 passengers and four crew .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Three thugs high on drink and drugs have been jailed after robbing two men in Salford within minutes of each other. Ballet master Dominic Antonucci, 39, was walking through Ordsall Park at 11am on Saturday, February 1 ahead of a matinee performance of The Prince of the Pagodas at the Lowry Theatre when he was attacked Manchester Crown Court heard. Mr Antonucci, who dances with Birmingham Royal Ballet, was pulling his suitcase and wearing a rucksack when he was set upon by William Paine, 23, Liam Johnson, 18, and Jerome Tue, 18. Liam Johnson (centre with thumbs up) arrives at Manchester Crown Court where he was jailed for two years for two muggings . Mr Antonucci was punched in the face and had a bottle smashed over his head before going to the ground where he was kicked and punched. He cried out for help and passers-by came over as the three thugs walked away in a ‘casual manner’ with his suitcase. It was later found dumped. Mr Antonucci was taken to Salford Royal where he was treated but still suffers from a serious injury to his left eye. In a victim impact statement read to the court Mr Antonucci said he is still having problems with his eye and had been unable to work for two months after the robbery. However, he said that bore no ill-will towards his attackers. Mr Antonucci a father of one who was bullied at school because of his love of ballet, suffered serious neck and head injuries as well as damaged teeth and he needed surgery to repair a damaged retina in his left eye. He later had to wear an eye patch and was unable to perform for eight weeks and now feels nervous whenever he goes out. Victim: Dominic Antonucci (laying down in front) was unable to work for eight weeks after the attack on him in a Salford park . In a statement he said: ‘As someone who has worked in pretty rough schools teaching dance I feel for them and I hope they can get themselves sorted out. I don’t have any feelings of revenge. ‘I’m just pleased there’s no lasting effects and I’m back at work. It was a sickening attack and I’m thrilled it’s all over. It saved a lot of trouble and heartache for everyone that they all pleaded guilty. That was a big comfort. ‘Everything happened so fast so it’s really lucky there were witnesses. It was half way over before I knew what was going on so I would not have been much of a help. My daughter is 15 and she was very upset to see my injuries and what happened. William Paine (looking at camera) outside Manchester Crown Court where he was jailed for two years . William Paine (left) shows respect for the law by turning up in a grey tracksuit at Manchester Crown Court where he was jailed for two years for a vicious mugging . ‘We’re just relieved it’s over and we can move on with our lives. It was a traumatic experience. It has taken me a long time to feel comfortable on the streets again. I was a bit afraid of even a pigeon flying nearby. It does feel like I can close the book on it. ‘It was the frustration at having to see them unzip my suitcase and go through it. My front teeth were badly damaged and I am still receiving treatment with an estimated cost of £900. ‘I have a scratch to the left cornea which has meant five different hospital visits. That’s had the most impact on my daily life as I have been unable to work for 7 to 8 weeks and had to wear an eye patch and dark glasses. Even now I’m quite nervous when out and it’s difficult because I’m usually a confident guy.’ Within minutes the three muggers had struck again, this time attacking John Owen, 52, a postman on his delivery round. One of the three shouted: ‘Let’s do him. lads!’ and he was then subjected to a ‘frenzied’ attack, being kicked and punched while curled up in a ball before his attackers left with his postbag. Mr Owen, a postman for 11 years, has felt unable to go out on rounds again following the attack, suffers anxiety attacks and his victim impact statement said that the robbery had a ‘massive effect’ on his personality. ‘[They] don’t realise the after effect these incidents have on people,’ he told the court. Police were called and all three were arrested after fleeing the scene of the attack. Paine, Johnson and Tue all from Salford admitted two counts of robbery at an earlier hearing. Paine, a father-of-two, had numerous previous convictions, as did Johnson, including a conviction aged 13 for a robbery involving a knife. Tue had never been in trouble before. The court heard all three had been drinking and taking cocaine at an all-night party and could remember little if anything of the robberies. Ordsall Park where Mr Antonucci was attacked . Jailing Paine and Johnson, Recorder Terence Rigby told them: ‘This is not just a tragedy for you but a tragedy for your family and friends and it is one you have brought upon them. My judgement is that each of these offences was very if not the most serious of robberies - made the more serious by the fact there were two robberies on two victims within a few minutes of each other. ‘I have no doubt drink and drugs played a part in what you did but the fact of the matter is it doesn’t matter to him whether you were drunk or had been taking cocaine or anything else. ‘What matters to him is that he was set upon and violently assaulted. I think that this is not a tragedy for you but it is a tragedy for your family and friends and one that you have brought on them and I hope you all finally see sense.’ Defending father-of-two Paine, Hunter Gray said: ‘He has not drunk alcohol since the offences. No real forethought went into this.’ For Johnson, Robert Kearney: ‘His memory of the incident is non-existent. It was a brave thing to enter his plea. A guilty plea is the ultimate expression of remorse. He has GCSEs and has qualified in football coaching. It lacked sophistication. A hooded top is the uniform of youth not a form of disguise.’ Paine and Jones were each jailed for two years and Tue got 16 months. All were told pay a £100 victim surcharge.","Ballet master Dominic Antonucci, 39, was walking through Ordsall Park, Salford when he was attacked .

"By . Ashley Collman . Two-time Olympian Hope Solo appeared in court to get assault charges dismissed on Monday, after allegedly getting into a fight at her half-sister's house last June. The 32-year-old soccer star is accused of beating up her half-sister and nephew in a drunken brawl, when she allegedly went over to the sibling's house to complain about her husband who was 'being a jerk'. But today, Solo and husband Jerramy Stevens put on a united front as they attended the brief hearing, which set up a new court date for November. They even smiled and held hands as they exited Kirkland, Washington municipal court. Stevens is a former tight end who played for the Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Solo has helped the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team win two gold medals at the Olympics and currently plays goalie for the Seattle Reign. Facing the charges together: Soccer player Hope Solo (left) and her husband Jerramy Stevens (right), a former pro-football player, appeared in court on Monday for another hearing regarding assault charges against Solo . Better now: Solo is accused of beating her half-sister and 17-year-nephew up in a drunken rage last June. According to the affidavit, Solo went over to her sisters house to complain about her husband who was being a 'jerk'. Above, Solo and her husband in court on Monday . According to the police affidavit, Solo went over to her half-sister's home 'upset about the fact that her husband refused to take her to catch a flight because he was being a jerk.' The siblings proceeded to start drinking wine and Solo apparently became intoxicated. At some point, Solo thought her 17-year-old nephew was insulting her so she told him he was 'too fat and crazy' to be a professional athlete. The nephew went into another room where Solo continued to berate him, calling him a 'fat p****' when he called his mom, according to police documents obtained by TMZ. 'I then told her to get her c*** face out of my house' the boy told police. Solo went on the offensive and stared punching her nephew and grabbing his hair. When the boy's mother intervened, Solo lashed out at her as well, punching her several times. Solo finally let up and left the house when the nephew called police. Responding officers noted that the boy had redness on one cheek and was bleeding from a cut on the ear, wearing a torn shirt. A bruise on Solo's sister's cheekbone was turning purple. TMZ later obtained pictures of the injuries. Star: Solo has helped the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team win two gold medals at the Olympics. Pictured above at a USA v France game last June . Team player: Solo currently plays for the Seattle Reign soccer team. She apologized to her fans after her public arrest . Solo has pleaded not guilty to charges of domestic violence. Her lawyer hopes to get the charges dropped at the next hearing on November 4. The soccer player apologized for her very public arrest on Facebook, explaining that her family has had troubles in the past. 'I understand that, as a public figure, I am held to a higher standard of conduct,' she wrote. 'I take seriously my responsibilities as a role model and sincerely apologize to everyone I have disappointed.' She went on to say she was confident her named would be cleared. This isn't the first time Solo and Stevens have been embroiled in controversy. Stevens was arrested just before their wedding in 2012 for assault after a disturbance involving Solo, but he was not charged. Solo said soon afterward that there never was an assault and that she and her new husband were happy. 'It's unfortunate what the media can do to judge before the facts are out there. It's hard to see, but it's a hard truth, and it's part of life,' she said at the time. 'I'm happy. I'm happily married. I would never stand for domestic violence. I've never been hit in my life.' Solo is due back in court on November 4. Fight prone: This isn't the first time Solo and her husband have been embroiled in controversy. He was arrested shortly before their marriage on suspicion of assault but the charges were later dropped. Pictured above entering court on Monday .

In an interview with The Sunday Times Miss Miller reveals she sold the home in Stroud for £597,000 and made little profit out of it, admitting that she and her family ‘were living beyond our means and the house was far too expensive to run. But it was a wrench to let go of it. ‘My business ran into trouble in spring of last year because I had postnatal depression and we had real issues with my financial backers, and we didn’t have a fall-back plan.

Revins stumbled into a branch of Barclays in Hanley, Staffordshire, at midday on January 21 and pulled a bread knife on terrified staff. A bank clerk found that 49-year-old Revins’s cashpoint card could not be used because the limit had already been reached that day. Drunken Patrick Revins has been jailed for 27 months after being caught twice in possession of three large knives . Revins who has a variety of tattoos on his face including his initials and the name Annette began muttering about a woman that he knew ‘who had done it’ and said he was going to ‘have her’. The bank staff asked him to leave and that was when he lifted his top and pulled a large bread knife from the front of his trousers. Revins then put the knife back into his trousers and left the bank. Revins was arrested 20 minutes later. Police seized a large kitchen knife with an eight-inch blade. Two days later, while on bail, Revins was stopped again, and found to be carrying a bayonet and a large carving knife. Police arrested him. Patrick Revins, 49, stumbled into this branch of Barclays in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, at midday on January 21 and pulled a bread knife on terrified staff . Sentencing Revins at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court Judge Paul Glenn told him: ‘You were unable to walk in a straight line in the bank, no doubt due to drink and or drugs. ‘Courts have repeatedly emphasised the seriousness of carrying knives. ‘Those who carry knives frequently end up using them. ‘You habitually carry knives when drunk or under the influence of drugs. You plainly represent a danger to others.’ The court heard he has a history of violence, including a wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm case in 2006. William Rickarby, defending, said in mitigation that no one was threatened and Revins made no attempt to use the knife in the bank.","Patrick Revins, 49, stumbled into the Hanley, Staffs, branch of Barclays with the knife in his trousers .

"By . John Naish . Many swear by its healing qualities, health gurus prescribe it for everything from bad skin to stomach ulcers and now crooks are counterfeiting it for huge profits. Manuka honey has acquired a quasi-magical reputation as a natural cure for an amazing variety of ailments. The model Lizzie Jagger uses it as lip balm in the belief that it will protect her from germs. Soothing: Opera singer Katherine Jenkins, pictured, drinks manuka dissolved in hot water to help her voice . The actress Scarlett Johansson says that she has regular manuka facials to ‘pull the impurities’ from her skin. And opera singer Katherine Jenkins drinks manuka dissolved in hot water to help her voice. But such miraculous qualities come at a price. Forget the £1.79 you might pay for some runny honey to spread on your toast in the morning, pots of this panacea can sell for up to £60 for a 500g jar. It has been nicknamed ‘liquid gold’ — and so it has proved for unscrupulous sellers, who package ordinary honeys as ‘manuka’ and sell them for £30 a jar. Official figures, published in The  Grocer magazine, show that only 1,700 tons of manuka are produced annually, while around 10,000 tons are sold. The market is flooded with fakes. But is there any scientific basis for the claims for this wonder honey? Or have we been duped into spending a fortune on a product with no real health benefits? Genuine manuka honey is produced by bees whose hives are near flowering wild manuka bushes. These grow mainly on New Zealand’s North Island and are used in Maori medicine for colds, stomach upsets and as a painkiller. Liquid gold: Made in New Zealand, Manuka honey sells for around £60 for a 500g jar . Until the 1980s, beekeepers used to throw manuka honey away because of its strong medicinal taste. At best, it would be used in cattle feed. Then scientists at the University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand, began to make strong claims for its curative powers. Biochemist Professor Peter Molan led the investigation. ‘I’m a great believer that if anything is traditional then it works,’ he declared. ‘There may be no rational explanation, but that’s because we haven’t found it.’ Practically all natural honey contains a chemical called glucose oxidase, which helps to produce hydrogen peroxide — a bleaching agent that can kill bacteria, including the antibiotic-resistant hospital superbug MRSA. Professor Molan claimed that manuka honey is especially potent, as it seems to have additional bacteria-killing powers beyond other honeys. In a study published in 1991, his team removed the hydrogen peroxide from a range of honeys, including manuka. The investigators reported that only manuka retained the ability to kill bacteria. Many brands of the honey now carry a Unique Manuka Factor (UMF) number on the label. The theory is that the higher the UMF number, the greater its strength at killing bacteria — and the greater the price of the pot. For example, a 250g pot of Manuka Pharm honey with a UMF factor of 12, sold by the health food shop Holland & Barrett, costs £14.99, while a pot of the same size with a UMF of 24 costs £28.99. In practice, though, this labelling . system is not regulated by law in New Zealand, so honey producers can . effectively stick on whatever numbers they like. Such confusion has provided a golden opportunity for fraudsters to substitute cheap baker’s honey for the real thing. The Food Standards Agency in Britain has sent a nationwide alert to all trading standards departments, asking them to watch out for fakes. Honey suppliers in New Zealand believe that 1,700 tons of manuka is produced there every year — yet 1,800 tons are sold in the UK alone. Celebrity follower: Model Lizzie Jagger uses it as lip balm in the belief that it will protect her from germs . As Britain’s trading standards officers start combing the shelves for ‘funny honey’, we ought to question whether even real manuka is worth the price. Independent research does seem to support some of the claims. Investigators at the University of Wales Institute and Cardiff Metropolitan University, for example, report that manuka can, in lab tests, kill the hospital superbugs Clostridium difficile and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, vets have found manuka to be effective on infected wounds on horses when applied externally. But such claims do not necessarily mean manuka is a miracle cure-all. Take just one example. The honey is widely claimed by alternative practitioners to provide an effective remedy for stomach ulcers. Fresh-faced: Scarlett Johansson says that she has regular manuka facials to 'pull the impurities' from her skin . This is based on research showing that manuka can kill a bacteria responsible for them, Helicobacter pylori, in the laboratory. However, clinical trials have shown that the lab results do not translate to real life: when patients swallowed the honey to try to cure or alleviate their ulcers, it didn’t work. This may well be due to the fact that the stomach breaks down the honey before it gets to the ulcer. Similarly, there is no reputable published independent clinical evidence to support widespread claims for manuka’s unique power to cure or prevent sore throats when swallowed, or to banish acne when applied externally. Much of the evidence supporting manuka’s benefits has been produced by the Honey Research Unit — part-funded by New Zealand’s beekeepers — at the University of Waikato. Facial: There is no reputable published independent clinical evidence to support widespread claims for manuka's unique power to banish acne when applied externally . But in 2012, the university shut down all the unit’s web pages without explanation. Commentators in New Zealand believe the university has turned its back on the studies. However, across the world, other universities have been trumpeting the benefits of their own local honeys. Scientists at the University of Thessaly in Greece reported, in January, the results of tests on 31 local Greek and Cypriot honeys which investigated their superbug-killing abilities. They claimed that some have the potential to be just as effective as manuka, and may even contain their own unique bug-killing powers. Scientists at two Canadian universities have reported how honey made from the country’s buckwheat flowers may be as effective as manuka at killing harmful bacteria. They also found that honey made from Canadian clover may have as much potential as manuka to be a remedy for skin rashes caused by shingles. Biologists at the Slovak Academy of Sciences concluded in April 2011 that: ‘Slovak honeydew honey has exceptional antibacterial activity against multi-drug-resistant S. maltophilia and was more efficient than manuka honey.’ All of this leaves manuka in a rather dubious position as regards its ‘unique’ effectiveness. The trouble seems to be a lack of reputable ‘double-blind’ studies. The best that can be said is that — like all natural honeys — it seems to have some beneficial bacteria-killing powers. And unless you gobble the stuff down like Pooh Bear, you can’t really do yourself any harm by taking it. Unfortunately, however, the science does not justify manuka’s hype. Instead the product has become, all too often, a very expensive honey trap.","Stars including Katherine Jenkins swear by manuka honey's healing qualities .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Three weeks after he was forced out, the founder of American Apparel has come to an agreement with the company and has been rehired as a ‘strategic consultant’. Dov Charney, 45, was sacked last month from the company he founded when he was 20 with . the board citing his alleged misuse of company funds and role in . disseminating nude photos of an ex-employee who filed a case against him . in 2011. ‘Mr. Charney will serve as strategic consultant until the end of the investigation. Based on the findings of the investigation, the committee will determine if it is appropriate for Mr. Charney to serve as CEO or an officer or employee of American Apparel,’ American Apparel officials said in a statement. Dov Charney will keep his large salary of $832,000 during the investigation into his alleged behaviour . The deal also stated five of the seven board members, including Mr Charney, will step down voluntarily. Only Allan Mayer and David Danziger, the current co-chairmen, will remain on a new board. The company said there is an ongoing investigation into the founder’s alleged misconduct, which is overseen by an independent board committee. Mr Charney has described the allegations as false and insisted he is still the 'best man for this job'. As part of the deal the Los Angeles Times reports that Mr Chaney is forbidden from accessing the company's computer systems. He will keep his salary - $832,000 a year - during the investigation. Dov Charney has accused the board of American Apparel of conducting a 'hateful campaign' against him . In an interview he gave after being fired, Mr Charney told the Financial Times: 'I think it's highly unusual that a board - any board - would indulge in such a hateful PR campaign against its founder.' American Apparel most recently said that they decided to sack Mr Charney based on information that he allowed an employee to impersonate and post naked photos online of a former worker who sued Mr Charney in 2011 for $260million after she claimed that he forced her to be his 'sex slave'. The case was dismissed in 2012 but the former employer was subject to an online campaign to discredit her, and Mr Charney is now facing claims he failed to stop it. The New York Post . has reported that Canadian Mr Charney was expected to say that he did not know about the . blog before it was published online and therefore isn't responsible for . the 'liabilities' cited by American Apparel. Mr Charney's . lawyers have pointed out that the board renewed his employment in April . 2012; more than a year after the blog was published. Irene Morales, 21, said that Charney allegedly made her his sex slave and new information states Charney may have allowed an employee to impersonate her online . In the letter to the board lawyer Patricia Glaser said the company had failed to give Mr Charney 21 days' notice of his severance package as required by law, making his dismissal 'not only unconscionable but illegal.' A link to the letter, whose receipt the source familiar with the matter confirmed, was provided in an article on the Wall Street Journal's website. The letter threatened legal action should Mr Charney not regain his executive positions. Mad genius? Dov Charney, 45, a Canadian national, started American Apparel in 1991 as a humble wholesale T-shirt manufacturer . The management shakeup followed years of stagnation, as the company amassed more than $250million of debt.

"By . Ian Birrell . The freight train filled with its grisly cargo of death last night finally pulled out of the station where it had sat for almost two days. While accusations of mistreatment flew around the world, the stench grew in the heat as two more truckloads of remains were loaded to join those packed into body bags inside four refrigerated carriages. Ukrainian officials said 282 corpses have been found, along with 87 fragments from 16 bodies. There are fears some body parts may have been incinerated as aircraft wreckage exploded. Scroll down for video . Finally: The refrigerated train carrying the bodies of MH17 crash victims has finally set off from rebel-held Torez in eastern Ukraine four days after the disaster . Remains: The train is carrying the bodies of 282 victims and 87 fragments from a further 16, Ukrainian officials said. The rest were incinerated . Almost 200 of the bodies were packed . on to the train in Torez station, about nine miles from the main crash . site, while obscene arguments raged over the conducting of forensic . investigations. Rebel . militia have been accused of wilfully allowing the site’s desecration. Bodies were left out for two days in sweltering heat while possessions . were looted and picked over. Some items even caught fire in the hot sun . yesterday, shortly before the search of the crash site was declared . over. Russian sources said last night the grey freight train containing the bodies was moving to the regional capital, Donetsk. The ultimate destination is expected to be the city of Kharkiv, currently loyal to Kiev. Luggage: As pro-Russian separatists prepared the train to set off from the station in Torez, the passengers' luggage was also driven over from the site . Loading: The bodies of the victims were ferried from the site to a station in rebel-held Torez using rubbish trucks today . Grim: Families have hit out at officials on the site after these pictures emerged of men in gas masks climbing over bodies and dragging them into the train . Dutch forensics arrived at the site to identify the bodies that will now be handed to officials in the Netherlands, which lost 173 civilians . Almost 200 victims were piled high in the sweltering heat in eastern Ukraine in the village near Grabovo controlled by pro-Russian separatists . Workers donned protective suits to unload the bodies and remains, many of which were badly burned in the crash, before loading them into the train . The operation appeared to be run efficiently despite accusations that rebel militia willfully allowed the site to be tampered with and destroyed . This is one of the images that enraged relatives of the 298 dead as their loved ones were shovelled into the back of a rubbish van . A . team of 12 Malaysian aviation investigators arrived in Donetsk last . night. According to their country’s prime minister, the group’s chief . was due to be handed the aircraft’s black boxes. It was also reported . that a deal had been reached with pro-Russian militia to allow the . investigatory team ‘safe access’ to the crash site. For . much of the day, militia men strutted around cradling assault rifles . outside the faded white station building in Torez as they held hostage . the human remains of people their forces almost certainly killed. They allowed Dutch investigators to examine the bodies for the first . time, while a team of international observers from the Organisation for . Security and Cooperation in Europe oversaw the loading of the . most-recently discovered remains. I watched as human remains were placed on the train with a sickening lack of decorum. Guards: The claims attempting to implicate Ukraine in the MH17 disaster came as rebel soldiers continued to stand guard over the corpses in Torez, eastern Ukraine, where they are left in refrigerated train carriages (pictured in the background) Standing watch: A separatist soldier stands just outside Torez train station, where the 200 bodies are being kept . On the scene: Rebels armed with AK-47s were surrounding the train carriages today, which before had been openly accessible to members of the public . Escort: A Dutch forensics expert, centre in blue and orange, was seen flanked by armed men coming back from the train carriages . A . blue dumper truck pulled up close to the carriage, while the guards . said they were waiting for a worker with ‘specialist equipment’ to open . the doors. After the . international observers arrived, protected by members of the security . force supposed to have been disbanded after the February killing of . protesters in Kiev that sparked the Ukraine crisis, this worker turned . up with a hammer to force a door lever. Another . man in an orange fluorescent vest climbed on to the truck and casually . slung a black bag containing body parts to a colleague on the train, . while the station manager covered her face at the stench. ‘The smell is simply horrible,’ admitted one of the militia from two separate paramilitary groups who were guarding the train. Horrifying: The bodies are dumped in rubbish trucks by rescue workers. Despite criticism, militiamen insist they are doing everything they can for the dead . Hauling: Rescue workers spent hours upon hours moving bodies around the site, which had lain where they fell for days . Efforts: Emergency workers have now recovered the vast majority of victims bodies from the crash site . Like . other rebels, he insisted the dead were being treated with dignity. ‘It . is horrible to see all these women and children lying dead,’ he said. ‘It is one thing when you see men killed on a battlefield but this is . quite different.’ Inside the . train, one of the rail staff was making a cup of tea for himself. ‘We . do not know of the final destination,’ he insisted. ‘We have not been told when we are leaving or where we are going.’ Ukrainian officials in Kharkiv, nearly 200 miles from the crash scene, . say they have been expecting the remains since Saturday after an . agreement with rebel leaders in Donetsk. The . town has prepared a special refrigerated warehouse to receive the . bodies and put scores of hotel rooms on standby for relatives. More than . 30 bodies are understood to have already been taken to a hospital . morgue in Donetsk. Row on row: The bagged victims were gathered and piled onto vehicles before being taken to a train station in rebel-held Torez, nine miles from the crash site . Piled up: Rescue workers are pictured above at the MH17 crash site in Grabovo, eastern Ukraine, moving bodies onto trucks . Loading up: The rescue workers were seen holding up the back of the truck with a stick while the bodies were tossed on board . Aftermath: Black bags are still being taken from the crash site by rescue workers . Horrifying: The international community has expressed outrage over the undignified scene - with swarms of flies buzzing around the train . Dirty work: Some of the emergency services laid flowers on the bagged-up bodies, as outrage at their treatment intensified across the world . Cleared: Two workers prepare the vehicle for the corpses at a crash site in Grabovo . Pro-Russian guards at the scene arrested several journalists making . inquiries on Sunday, although one militia man there confirmed to me that . some bodies were inside. Earlier yesterday, Ukraine accused rebels of blocking the train’s departure. ‘We managed to load 192 bodies and eight body parts of the innocent . victims of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 flight on to a special . train,’ said vice prime minister Volodymyr Hroisman. ‘The train has not left the station, for the terrorists are blocking . the way. We are in constant negotiations with them regarding the . transportation of the bodies of the victims.’ Australia’s foreign minister condemned using bodies of murdered people as political pawns in a conflict. ‘It is time for these bodies to be brought home and it’s time for an . investigation into who is responsible for this atrocity to begin,’ said .

"By . Paul Donnelley . American men have to register for the draft so if their country calls they can answer. There is, however, a limit to serving your country. A line that the Selective Service System seems to have overlooked by sending draft registration notices to 14,250 Pennsylvanian men born from 1893 to 1897. Failure to register is 'punishable by a fine and imprisonment' potential draft dodgers are warned. When puzzled family members began calling the agency realised its error. In this photo taken on Tuesday, July 8, 2014, Harold Weaver sits behind his wife, Martha, in their Nickleville, Pa, home. Martha holds a letter from the Selective Service for her late father, Fred Minnick, requiring him to register for the nation's military draft. The letter arrived too late for Minnick, who was born in 1894 and died on April 20, 1992. (AP Photo/The Derrick, Jerry Sowden) Chuck Huey, 73, of Kingston, revealed that he got a notice addressed to his late grandfather Bert Huey, a veteran of the First World War who was born in 1894 and died in 1995 at the age of 100. 'I said, ""Jeez, what the hell is this about?"" It said he was subject to heavy fines and imprisonment if he didn't sign up for the draft board,' he said. 'We were just totally dumbfounded.' Mr Huey tried calling the Selective Service but couldn't get through to a human being. That frustrated him even more because he wanted to make sure the agency knew that there had been a mistake. 'You just never know. You don't want to mess around with the federal government,' he said. The mistake, it turns out, originated with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) during a transfer of nearly 400,000 records to the Selective Service. A clerk working with the state's database failed to select the century, producing records for males born between 1993 and 1997 — and for those born a century earlier, PennDOT spokesman Jan McKnight admitted yesterday. 'We made a mistake, a quite serious selection error,' Miss McNight said. The Selective Service did not initially catch the mistake because the state used a two-digit code to indicate year of birth, spokesman Pat Schuback said. The federal agency identified 27,218 records of men born in the 1800s, began mailing notices to them on June 30, and began receiving calls from family members on July 3. By that time, it had sent 14,250 notices in error. 'It's never happened before,' Schuback said. The men are almost certainly all dead, given that the youngest would be turning 117 this year. Families of those men who received the notices can simply ignore them, he said. Their files will be deactivated and they shouldn't receive additional communications from the Selective Service. The agency also posted a notice and an apology on its website. The state Transportation Department, meanwhile, said that it had taken steps to ensure its mistake won't be repeated. 'We're really sorry,' McNight said. 'We apologise.'","Selective Service System sent draft registration notices to Pennsylvanians born from 1893 to1897 .

"By . Ian Birrell . Olga Neiman was asleep when the missile struck shortly after 9pm, exhausted by the daily exertions of looking after her two-year-old daughter. She was woken by the explosion. The bangs and booms of war have been commonplace in recent days, but she realised instantly this one was horribly close to home. Running outside, she found her neighbour’s house on fire. Fortunately its owner – an elderly woman in her 80s who emigrated from Russia three decades ago – was staying with her daughter nearby for safety. Two other homes lay wrecked, one in flames after a gas explosion, while another had been obliterated, replaced by a pile of rubble with an upended mattress and leatherette sofa sitting in its midst. A bent frying pan lay nearby, battered by the blast. Deadly blast: Smokes rises from Gaza city rises after an attack from the north towards Israel . Emergency response: Medics carry a 14-year-old Palestinian from Gaza into a hospital in el-Arish, 290 kilometers (180 miles) east of Cairo, Egypt. He was caught up in an Israeli air strike . Tank: An Israeli artillery cannon fires a shell on the border with the Gaza Strip . ‘I am worried for my daughter but I am still staying here,’ said Neiman, 39, who lives in the southern Israeli city of Be’er Sheva, a repeat target for the missiles fired from Gaza. Sirens sounded again yesterday as fearful homeowners retrieved possessions from their ruins. Yet this passionate mother was just as alarmed to see Palestinian children being killed by Israeli forces. ‘There must be some other solution than all this happening again,’ she said. Much of the world would share her weary sentiments as Israeli forces and militants in the besieged Gaza Strip carried on trading rockets and rhetoric yesterday. It all feels so familiar, so forlorn, so fantastically self-defeating for both sets of citizens snared in this seemingly ceaseless and hopeless conflict. This time, around 130 Palestinians have been killed so far – most of them civilians, according to the United Nations. This number could increase rapidly as tensions rise. Victims have included many women and children. Israel claimed to have hit another 60 ‘terror targets’ yesterday, as it took its tally to well over 1,000 strikes in the five days since the struggle flared up again. One strike on a charitable association for disabled people in northern Gaza was reported to have left at least two women dead and four others wounded, according to medical staff. Aftermath: Palestinians inspect the rubble of Al-Farouk mosque, which was destroyed in an Israeli air strike, in Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip . Support: A man carries two young boys near the scene of the blast . Debris: The devastation surrounding the Al-Farouk mosque in Nuseirat. The Israeli military released an aerial photo of the mosque, saying Hamas hid rockets in it right next to another religious site and civilian homes . Although Israel says it tries hard to reduce civilian casualties, warning targets by phone minutes before their homes are destroyed, the victims also include a doctor and a pharmacist, a four-year-old boy and a man aged 80. Clearly they are not all terrorists. A mosque was also demolished, although Israel claimed the building was being used to hide weapons. Someone scrawled a jibe against the Israeli prime minister on one shattered wall in response: ‘We will prevail despite your arrogance, Netanyahu.’ Both protagonists in this conflict know that propaganda is a powerful weapon. There were claims yesterday of Israeli special forces advancing into Gaza and clashing with al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the organisation Palestinian Islamic Jihad. If confirmed, this would mark an alarming escalation. Israel has already mobilised 20,000 reservists and its army chief, Lieutenant-General Benny Gantz, hinted yesterday he was ready to send tanks and troops across the boundary into Gaza. Their last such incursion was in early 2009, and lasted a fortnight. Spate of attacks: Israel's aerial bombardment of Gaza continued for a fifth day, with a strike on a mosque said to be concealing a weapons cache . Tensions: There have been over 1,000 strikes in the last five days since the struggle flare up again . Shelter: People sit on the floor as they take cover in the Tel Aviv main shopping mall, as air sirens warn of incoming rockets in the vicinity . ‘We are in the midst of an assault and we are prepared to expand it as much as is required, to wherever is required, with whatever force will be required and for as long as will be required,’ said Gantz. Israel insists it is entitled to stop missiles being fired over its borders. Dozens have been thwarted by its Iron Dome protective shield, although I also saw a petrol station in the port of Ashdod where one narrowly missed a tanker unloading fuel but still caused serious injuries. But as diplomats try to find a solution to stop the bloodshed, Israel faces a growing global backlash over its brutal response. Yesterday Foreign Secretary William Hague expressed concern about the loss of life in Gaza and demanded ‘de-escalation’ of the crisis, although he carefully endorsed Israel’s right to defend itself. And last night in a statement approved by all of its 15 members, the UN Security Council called for a ceasefire. This is the deadliest conflict here since November 2012, when 180 Palestinians and six Israelis were killed. That crisis was eventually halted with mediation from Egypt. Casualties: The Palestinian death toll has risen to 130 as a result of the increase in strikes . So how have we reached this situation where democratic Israel is on the brink of its third major offensive against Gaza in under six years – and lasting peace seems as distant as ever in this bitterly contested corner of the planet? The core issues, of course, go back many years. But the latest conflict was sparked by the slaughter of three Israeli teenagers, who disappeared while hitch-hiking home to a settlement in the West Bank. Israel blamed Hamas, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that runs Gaza, and began rounding up activists. A 17-year-old Palestinian boy was then abducted and murdered in a horrific act of reprisal as he waited for prayers at his local mosque. This led to riots in Jerusalem and rumbling rocket fire from Gaza, which was met in return with Israeli air-raids and attacks. Distraught: An Israeli man stands at the entrance to his house after it was hit by a rocket . At the heart of the struggle is Gaza, a crowded strip of coastal land lying along Israel’s western flank and home to 1.5 million Palestinians. Many are crammed into refugee camps and live in great poverty; two-thirds do not have access even to a sewage system. Yet behind this lie larger issues. Many on the Israeli Right want to destroy Hamas, an ally of Iran seen as a terrorist organisation by the United States and Europe, yet others fear it might be succeeded by the sort of extreme jihadis that have emerged in Iraq and Syria. Hamas has been weakened by Egypt’s new post-coup regime, which overthrew an elected Muslim Brotherhood government. It has closed down almost all the border tunnels that were used to smuggle in cars, weapons, fuel and missile parts. So for all the howls of outrage, some analysts believe it suits Hamas and its ruthless leadership to have another fight with Israel in order to shore up dwindling support. Carrying on: As the conflict rages on, residents relax on a beach in Tel Aviv . Meanwhile, the latest long-term peace talks broke down in April, seemingly because Israel was angered by a unity deal between Hamas and its rival Fatah. The two-state solution, the only realistic settlement, seems as far away as ever. So on one side of the barbed wire impoverished Palestinians face the onslaught of one of the world’s most formidable war machines. And on the other, Israelis must sprint into stifling underground shelters as missile sirens sound again and again. Among those Russians who emigrated to Israel three decades ago in search of a better life only to find their homes blown apart in Be’er Sheva was 63-year-old Violetta Lubich. Yet this kindly carer still invited me into her house, the bomb holes all too evident. ‘I am very scared because every minute there might be another rocket attack,’ she told me. ‘I just feel so sad about this situation we find ourselves in.’ The tragedy is that there are so many human beings on both sides of this interminable and bloodstained struggle who must share her sadness.","Around 130 Palestinians have been killed so far - more than civilians .

"By . Ian Birrell . Loved and loathed: Narendra Modi, India's new premier . Twelve years ago, a train containing Hindu activists heading for a protest at the site of a demolished mosque was set on fire in a small town in the Indian state of Gujarat. The attack at Godhra killed 59 passengers, sparking vicious retribution against local Muslims. Mobs went on the rampage, raping hundreds of women and burning children after pouring kerosene down their throats. Men were forced to watch their families tortured to death, then they too were slaughtered. About 2,000 people died and 200,000 made homeless over three nightmarish days. Despite pleas for protection, Muslims were ignored by officials. As the blood flowed, the state’s newly-elected chief minister quoted Newton when he was asked about the carnage: ‘Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.’ No one was ever held accountable. But many Muslims, including the British relatives of victims, believe that chief minister has blood on his hands for inciting the savagery. Now this same man – banned from entering the US and shunned by British diplomats – has been elected India’s new prime minister after a landslide election victory. Narendra Modi stormed to power yesterday, with results revealing the pro-business Hindu nationalist trounced the ruling Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. After a six-week election involving 500million voters, Modi’s opposition Bharatiya Janata Party took more than six times the seats of its closest rival. It was the most decisive mandate since the 1984 assassination of prime minister Indira Gandhi propelled her son to office. It immediately led to a stock market rally and raucous celebrations among Modi’s supporters. His rise is a remarkable story: the tea boy from a lowly caste who rose to lead the world’s biggest democracy. The celibate, yoga-loving technocrat, 63, has been swept into power by an electorate fed up with a stuttering economy, stifling corruption and state sclerosis. Victory: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters dance to celebrate Modi's win . Hardline Hindu: Modi takes blessings from his mother Heeraben, 90 . Although his election success was anticipated, the scale of victory was a shock. Unlike recent Indian governments, the BJP will not be constrained by coalition – marking what his spokesman called a ‘tectonic shift’. For once, this was not election hyperbole. After India’s most crushing triumph for three decades, Modi’s first comment was on Twitter. ‘India has won. Good times ahead,’ he told his four million followers, before visiting his 90-year-old mother to celebrate. But given his history, there are fears this hardline Hindu nationalist will inflame tensions with India’s 180million Muslim minority and its neighbour, Pakistan. The two have had four wars since the 1947 partition of India – and both have nuclear arms. Modi, now 63, pictured as a young boy . ‘This could go either way,’ said one Muslim diplomatic source. ‘It could be a terrible result for the region – but equally, sometimes these extreme politicians become more pragmatic when forced to grapple with the realities of power.’ Sonia Gandhi, head of the Congress Party that dominated politics since independence, once called Modi ‘a merchant of death’. But to his fans, he is India’s saviour after the stumbling rule of Congress’s Manmohan Singh, a mild-mannered Sikh economist. Singh last night looked set to win less than 50 of the 543 parliamentary seats at stake, a humiliation for the force that has dominated Indian politics in the 67 years since independence. Claims that Modi would re-open communal wounds clearly failed to convince voters. Born to a family of grocers, Modi spent his childhood helping at his father’s rail station tea stall – a striking contrast to the privileged lifestyle of the Gandhi dynasty. He is understood to have been forced into marriage at 13 to Jashodaben, now a shy, retired teacher.  But his growing fascination with militant Hinduism made him determined to live as a bachelor. In his teens he joined a banned extreme sect called Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which promoted ascetic living, charity work and military-style discipline. It was reportedly inspired by fascist movements in Europe. Narendra Modi greats crowds at the rally in Vadodara, in the western Indian state of Gujarat . Modi salutes to the crowds at an Independence day Function . Yet combined with skilful PR and self-promotion, he has built a power base that put him in charge of his western state for 13 years and now at the helm of his huge nation. Modi, who rises at 5am each day for an hour of yoga, turned his arid state into India’s most business-friendly region. By building roads he was rewarded with rapid economic growth, boosting his image as an efficient administrator who focuses on hard work and eschews the flashy trappings of success. He is fascinated by the rapid success of China, and his election campaign promoted an alluring vision of India freed of corruption and filled with bullet trains. A technology lover, he appearing at rallies as a hologram. Critics say Gujarat has fared no better than other states, while making little progress on India’s grinding social problems.

An election official counts votes in Hyderabad. If the results are finalised as expected, it would be the first time a single party has won an outright majority since 1984 . Muslims, worse off than Hindus on most measures from health to poverty, complain of discrimination. India has elected as prime minister its most divisive political figure, loved and loathed in equal measures. The hope is that this controversial character can shake off the stains on his reputation and drag his country into the shining future it deserves. Yet the fear for many is that he may send his nation spiralling back into the darkest days of its past.","Narendra Modi stormed to power yesterday .

"By . Ian Birrell . IN CRIMEA . Russian armoured vehicles firing heavy machine guns and supported by scores of special forces soldiers yesterday stormed one of the last two remaining Ukrainian bases still holding out in Crimea. The brutal assault at Pokryshkin airfield at Belbek, which left up to four wounded, was the first real clash involving the two countries’ armies since the Russians invaded the region four weeks ago. I watched as an armoured vehicle smashed through the walls of the base. It was followed by squads of soldiers crouching behind shields, and Spetsnaz special forces with assault rifles fanning out in the grounds. Scroll down for videos . Attack: Larisa Mamchur said yesterday she was 'worried' about the welfare of her husband, who has become the face of Ukraine' defiance. Above, Russian forces crash through the gates of the airbase on Saturday . Soldiers in unmarked uniforms sit atop an armoured patrol vehicle at the gate of the Belbek base as troops prepare to storm the compound . Members of pro-Russian self-defence units take cover behind cars outside the military base while Russian forces take it over . Stun grenades were thrown at the few hundred remaining Ukrainian support staff and pilots at the base. They were armed only with AK-47 rifles, pistols and homemade staves carved from branches. One man was injured, kicked and beaten on the ground as two more armoured personnel carriers surrounded the facility and scores more Russian soldiers poured in, all wearing balaclavas and body armour. A Ukrainian soldier fell near me as a stun grenade exploded, then ran off to join his comrades. ‘Look who are the real Nazis now,’ said one senior Ukraine officer. Russian officers screamed at the Ukrainian troops to give up, with gunfire heard around the base. The unequal struggle carried on for 35 minutes, although the Ukrainians were ordered not to return fire by their officers. There was no panic, however, merely anger and abuse towards the invading army, punctured by bursts of nervous joking. The Russian troops fanned out around the base. One armoured personnel carrier drove in close to the headquarters, its machine gun pointed at the Ukrainian forces, while marksmen knelt beside it . Ready to attack: Armed men crouch behind a van just before charging into the base, where a stand-off has been developing for weeks . ‘We will stay until the end, we will not give up,’ said one Ukrainian. But the game was up after a stand-off that had lasted more than three weeks – to the growing frustration of the Russian forces who seized the arsenal and 35 aircraft at this strategically important base near Sevastopol last month. Its commander, a former fighter pilot named Colonel Yuli Mamchur, had emerged as Ukraine’s unlikely hero after marching his men into Russian fire aimed above their heads at the start of this strange conflict. Yesterday, minutes after officiating at a wedding between two of his junior officers, with sniper units moving into position on the hills above us, he told me he was ignoring the latest one-hour ultimatum to hand over his base. ‘The Russian Federation came here and told us to give up our weapons and leave. If we disagree, they will assault the base,’ he said. Three and a half hours later, they did exactly that. The warning came with gangs of pro-Russian militia gathering outside the buildings, while armoured personnel carriers and jeeps with mounted machine guns moved into position nearby. Arguments broke out at the gates between the militia and Ukrainian soldiers. ‘You have your aim to protect the base, but we have our aim to put our flag up,’ said one dressed in military clothing. Stand-off: Former fighter pilot Yuli Mamchur, left in peaked cap, emerged as an unlikely hero after a length stand-off with Russian forces . Smoke screen: A Ukrainian serviceman at a separate base in Novofedorivka tires to ward off Russian forces with a smoke grenade . Minutes later – at 4.45pm – the unequal show of strength from Russia began as its heavily-armoured vehicles crashed through the 8ft high perimeter walls. There was confusion and shouting, then wailing from ambulances sirens and thumping of heavy machine gun fire. ‘This is the bitter truth,’ Colonel Mamchur said with an ironic smile. Afterwards, he ordered his men to line up, just as they had a few hours earlier to celebrate their colleagues’ wedding with champagne. ‘Thank you for serving your commander. You can be proud of what you have achieved,’ he said. There were cheers, and even a few tears, from these tough-looking troops. His men, with Russian rifles trained on them, movingly responded with a raucous rendition of the Ukrainian national anthem and shouts of ‘glory to Ukraine, glory to heroes’. Then they were ordered by the Russians to return to their rooms while Colonel Mamchur was arrested and taken from the base.

A sailor holds the Russian St Andrew flag on top of the submarine which was taken over . Military personnel board the vessel as a number of ships were taken over by Russian forces and handed over to the Black Sea Fleet . Many were worried about their families, with some wives and children still on the base. Crowds of men waving the Russian flag gathered at the gates behind a fourth personnel carrier, with triumphant chants of ‘Russia, Russia, Russia’ breaking out. ‘This was not necessary,’ said Major Vladislav Korgic, a Ukrainian fighter pilot. ‘There have been no shots fired in Crimea since World War Two and now we have their special forces opening fire. This is very hard, everyone is worried.’ The previous day I had listened as  Colonel Mamchur rebuffed demands from a Russian colonel to surrender the base. ‘According to United Nations laws this is part of the Russian Federation,’ declared the officer, wearing civilian clothes. ‘It is illegal for you to be here.’ ‘No, this is the territory of Ukraine,’ replied Colonel Mamchur, in trademark brown leather jacket and large peaked cap. ‘I will protect my soldiers and the wives of my soldiers. So long as no one comes on the base, there will be no conflict.’ The Russian officer insisted the Ukrainian troops were acting illegally. ‘I want to be informed if you have given weapons to your staff,’ he said. ‘Our staff are guarding their territory,’ responded Colonel Mamchur. ‘You are an officer. You should understand my position. Every commander must chose his way, but I don’t want to kill anyone.’ As they talked, local men who supported Russian annexation shouted homophobic remarks at the colonel. ‘People have become crazy,’ said Colonel Mamchur’s wife Larissa, 44, who had stayed on the base. ‘I have had phone calls and texts saying lots of dirty and scary things. I’m proud of him, but worried.’ The Ukrainian troops knew an assault might be looming and felt abandoned by their bosses in Kiev. I saw two soldiers burning military documents on bonfires in the morning, while others carried personal possessions into cars. Last night, Major Korgic said by phone from the captured base: ‘We are worried about our commander. We don’t know where he is and nor does his wife.’","Russians attacked airfield in Belbek, Crimea, with armoured vehicles .

"By . Ian Birrell . Josef Stalin, pictured attending the Potsdam Conference in 1945, ordered the Tartars to be dispatched to Uzbekistan . At four o’clock in the morning Zodiye Saliyeva’s mother was ordered out of her home at gun point, along with her three sisters and all their neighbours in Yalta. Forced to leave their possessions, they were herded into a school before being crammed on to railway containers and despatched thousands of miles away to Uzbekistan. For they were Tartars – and the people that did this to them 70 years ago were Russian soldiers, acting under orders from Stalin to clear the Crimea of all its original inhabitants whom he accused falsely of collaboration with the Nazis. Nearly half died of disease, hunger or in the ‘crematoria on wheels’, while mosques were destroyed and properties confiscated. These shameful expulsions were merely the most brutal chapter in a bloodstained history of Russian and Soviet atrocities against the Tartars. Now these blighted people – who returned only after the break-up of the Soviet Union – find themselves trapped in the nightmare of confronting Russian forces once again. They are the most vocal opponents in Crimea of the Russian invasion – and for people such as Zodiye, a friendly grandmother of seven, these are terrifying times. ‘This feels very scary – we have seen all this before,’ she told me yesterday. ‘When my mother talked about what happened she always had tears in her eyes. Now I am worried for my children and grandchildren.’ Such fears are understandable for this 270,000-strong Muslim minority, which represents one in seven Crimeans. They have lived in the region since arriving with Genghis Khan seven centuries ago. Most of the rest are Russians, who started arriving after Catherine the Great annexed the peninsula in 1783. They have largely welcomed the intervention – but now tensions between the communities are growing as President Putin ratchets up pressure. Ukrainian servicemen gather on the territory of their military unit - protecting it from unidentified troops. Tartars are now terrified they will have to face Russian forces again, writes Ian Birrell . Pro-Russian activists have been holding up pictures and collecting cash for the families of two people who died in protests last week. Talk to them, and they soon start alleging Tartars used tear gas and carried knives – claims that are far from proven. Yesterday 200 Tartar women held a demonstration for peace in Kamenka, a suburb of the regional capital Simferopol. Along with their children, they clutched balloons in the colours of Ukraine and held banners saying, ‘Putin: our children are afraid of your protectors’ and ‘Do not kill’. Afterwards, in a symbolic show of support, they took food to Ukrainian troops blockaded by Russian forces in bases at Perevalne and Bakhchisaray. There has been hardly any other conspicuous opposition in Crimea to Moscow’s power play. Tartar leaders refuse to acknowledge the new ‘puppet government’ in Crimea, which has been formed by pro-Russian militants and is pushing hard for a separatist referendum. Self-defence groups have been formed to protect communities, who have long complained of police harassment and economic discrimination. A graphic showing the percentage vote for pro-Russian president Yanukovych in the 2010 election . Tartar leaders have urged the community not to respond to Russian provocation, fearing this is precisely what Putin wants to justify his invasion. But one local journalist said they were well-organised and could get thousands on the streets of Simferopol within one hour. Yet they accept they cannot fight one of the world’s best-equipped armies; indeed, Tartars are renowned for a record of non-violent resistance. Instead they have appealed for help to the international community. ‘We are very worried because we are not safe and this could lead to war,’ said a spokesman for the Mejlis of the Crimean Tartar People, their representative body. Others put it more starkly. ‘If there is a conflict we will be the first to suffer,’ said Usein Sarano. ‘This could be the new Yugoslavia.’","Ian Birrell reports from Crimea about the fears of the Tartars .

"By . Ian Birrell . Robert Mugabe wants the Queen to help get sanctions against his government lifted – and if she refuses, will strip British businesses of their assets in Zimbabwe. The dictator’s covert campaign of blackmail and bribery is exposed in secret documents, passed to The Mail on Sunday, that were drawn up by his closest advisers earlier this month. Astonishingly Mugabe hopes Nicholas Van Hoogstraten, the British slum landlord who has become Zimbabwe’s biggest landowner, can help clean up his image along with a £13 million public relations campaign. Top secret: Robert Mugabe wants the Queen to persuade the government to lift sanctions on Zimbabwe . He aims to persuade the Queen to ‘compel’ the British government to relent over sanctions, including offering her wildlife or mining concessions as ‘a token gift of goodwill to make the message of reconciliation profound and clear’. He will also offer cash for endorsements from sports and music stars who rally to his cause. But if his campaign fails, British-owned firms will be seized and given to Chinese rivals. ‘In the absence of  an agreement to take our offers and relent on sanctions ALL British-owned [firms] will be seized without compensation  and handed to friendly nations,’ said the documents. The move – described as ‘a delicate smash and grab’ – follows the 89-year-old despot’s return to power last month in a heavily-disputed presidential election. During the campaign Mugabe railed against Britain, and last week ranted at the United Nations about ‘illegal and filthy sanctions’, which include travel bans on him and his wife. A three-page document marked ‘top secret’ and drawn up two weeks ago for Joint Operations Command (JOC), the body that oversees state security, reveals his tactics to get them lifted. Property baron: Nicholas van Hoogstraten is believed to be part of a 'sanctions task force' The paper proposes the formation of a ‘sanctions task force’ headed by Patrick Chinamasa, the country’s new finance minister, and Van Hoogstraten, who has made a fortune under Mugabe’s murderous regime and funds his party. The Bognor-born businessman focused on Zimbabwe following his 2002 conviction for manslaughter for the killing of a business rival. The verdict was overturned on appeal, but he was later ordered to pay the dead man’s family £6 million in a civil case. He owns two huge homes in the country, along with 1,600 square miles of prime land – an area bigger than Cornwall. Once described by a judge as a ‘self-imagined devil who thinks he is an emissary of Beelzebub’, he is an unlikely choice for a delicate diplomatic mission. The new body will hire international public relations advisers to help seek a meeting with the Queen, who stripped Mugabe of his knighthood five years ago. ‘The task team must convince the Queen that there is more good for British interests if sanctions are lifted,’ the leaked papers say. They add that Mugabe will send the monarch a gift to underline reconciliation, ‘as a matter of urgency’. Sources in Harare said he would offer a diamond mine or game reserve. Other proposals including telling the Queen of ‘the availability of diamond mining blocks to British firms upon lifting of sanctions’, and arranging covert meetings with foreign secretary William Hague and Downing Street strategists Andrew Cooper and Christopher Lockwood. Mugabe is proposing to halt ‘indiginisation’ policies, which force companies to cede control to black Zimbabweans. Withdrawal: Zimbabwe quit the Commonwealth in 2003 after it was suspended  following flawed elections. Mugabe now wants to rejoin. Pictured here with the Queen and Prince Philip in 1994 . ‘As a measure of goodwill and image management the government will pause the takeover of prominent British-owned businesses,’ said the paper. Firms such as Barclays, Standard Chartered and Rio Tinto will be told executives must speak out in support of Mugabe’s campaign. ‘It must be made clear that any corporate that fails or shows little interest will pay a heavy price,’ the paper says. ‘Through co-ordinated media interviews, opinion pieces and paid-up articles businessmen must plead and blackmail the Queen to force her hand.’ If Mugabe’s overtures to Britain are resisted, ‘everything will be grabbed and offered to the Chinese and Russians’, said one  ruling party source, adding that Canadian and Australian firms were also ‘at risk.’ Bribery: The 89-year-old despot hopes to tempt the Queen with an offer of diamond mines or game reserves . Western sport and music stars will be offered bribes to support the campaign. ‘Celebrities will chose between mines and conservancy offers on top of cash,’ reveal  the documents. Sports stars will be told to convey the message Zimbabwe will rejoin the Commonwealth ‘if Her Majesty agrees to assist in the lifting of sanctions.’ Mugabe pulled his country out a decade ago after it was suspended following flawed elections. Zimbabwe’s swimming champion Kirsty Coventry – a double Olympic gold medallist called the ‘golden girl’ by Mugabe – is named as someone who will be asked to join the task force. She said yesterday she had not been approached and steers clear of politics. Britain and the EU suspended sanctions against 81 Zimbabweans in March after a peaceful vote on constitutional reform. Travel bans remain on ten figures closely linked to repression, alongside an arms embargo; these are set to be reconsidered next year. Endorsement: Mugabe wants sports stars, such as Kirsty Coventry, and musicians to back his campaign . A Foreign Office source said any moves against British firms would undermine global confidence in an economy recovering from the second worst hyper-inflation in history. ‘If you attack one country, you unnerve everyone,’ said the source. ‘It is a high-stakes game he is playing since Britain and America are the two biggest development donors.’ The revelations alarmed British businesses active in Zimbabwe. ‘What we are really worried about is violence against our staff and their families,’ said one executive. The documents underline the fragile state of the economy. They show Mugabe seeking funds from China and oil-rich Equatorial Guinea to pay civil servants, while mining firms will be told to fund water supplies in cities ‘to stem potential source of dissent’. Much of the nation’s wealth, especially from gold and diamond mines, has been stolen by top generals and politicians. The JOC proposes a ‘sacrificial prosecution’ to ‘create a new image . . . and show seriousness to the nation and the world’. Van Hoogstraten admitted this weekend being friends with Chinamasa but denied involvement with the task force. ‘I would assist if asked but I know nothing about this,’ he said. Buckingham Palace declined to comment last night.","British firms could be stripped of their assets unless sanctions are lifted .

"By . Ian Birrell . Welcome to the stroppy summit. Held in one of Europe’s most spectacular cities, it  was designed to  discuss the stuttering global economy but overshadowed by the carnage in Syria. And forget any idea of  dignified diplomacy to resolve the planet’s most pressing problems. When the world’s most powerful politicians flew in to St Petersburg, they indulged in an abject  display of posturing, preening and petulance. The G20 began with juvenile jinks over the seating at dinner and ended with open feuding among presidents and prime ministers representing two-thirds of the world’s population. All for show? There may have been public smiles, but there remains much disagreement between Putin and Cameron - not least with regard to Syria . At the centre of it all was Vladimir Putin, the prickly Russian president hosting the bash amid the baroque splendours of a Baltic city built three centuries ago as a symbol of his nation’s strength. His determination to protect Bashar Assad, his murderous Syrian ally who buys so much Russian weaponry, intensified a new Cold War with the United States. And it was a tough two days for David Cameron: shunted to the sidelines by Parliament’s reluctance to intervene against Assad, the butt of barbs from the Russians, and summoned to a testy meeting with Putin at 2am where they rowed for 20 minutes over Syria. Cameron also raised the issue of deteriorating gay rights, which have prompted calls for a boycott of next year’s winter Olympics in Sochi. His belligerent host replied that he needed Russians to make more children, but promised gay athletes and visitors faced no discrimination. Even as world leaders tucked into their salmon blinis and venison at the showcase dinner in the Peterhof  Palace, Cameron’s advisers were  frantically working out a response to the jibe that defined his trip to Russia. Welcome: Putin was his usual, boisterous self as he hosted the G20 Summit in St Petersburg . Putin’s spokesman was said  to have dismissed Britain as ‘the small island no one listens to’, going on to joke about his country’s oligarchs ‘buying Chelsea’. Yet the slur underscored Cameron’s reduced role at this surreal shindig – along with his nation’s uncertainty over its rightful place in a fast-changing world. One source close to French president Francois Hollande said Cameron had been neutered by the refusal of MPs to back military action in Syria. Others were even more direct about the impact of the parliamentary vote ten days ago. ‘Britain has been made to look less reliable on the world stage, and Parliament has diminished the office of the Prime Minister,’ said one of Cameron’s closest colleagues. The Prime Minister responded to the Russian jibe by rhapsodising over our role in shaping the world – although his claim that Britain defeated fascism must have rankled in a country that lost 20 million people in the Second World War. Say 'cheese': Russia's President Vladimir Putin, center front, stands with G-20 leaders during a group photo outside of the Konstantin Palace in St. Petersburg, Russia on Friday, where Syria's civil war became the hot topic of conversation . Civil: The dinner table of the G20 summit at Peterhof Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia, where the G20 summit took place . But it diverted attention from the harsh realities of the summit, which as key Downing Street insiders admitted, must have been difficult for Cameron given his deep-felt desire to respond to Syrian atrocities. Yet Cameron, while still arguing passionately for intervention, had to focus on pushing the cause of increased humanitarian aid rather than play the pivotal role he so desired in the unfolding drama over possible US-led attacks on Syria. So while Hollande discussed war plans with Barack Obama, Cameron discussed a possible trade trip with China’s leader Xi Jinping. From the start of this fractious summit there were symbolic differences. All the leaders were delivered in Russian-assembled BMWs – except for Obama, last to arrive in his own Cadillac for the briefest possible handshake with his host. Tensions boiled over at the sumptuous dinner that evening in the gilded palace. Obama turned up late again after working phones to win support for the looming Congressional vote on intervention, then went straight over for a strategic huddle with Cameron. For the next three hours, the leaders put their case on Syria while waiters bought a succession of desserts and topped up wine glasses. Cameron, Obama and Turkish premier Recep Tayyip Erdogan led arguments for a forceful response to the use of chemical weapons. Germany’s Angela Merkel was more cautious, while China, India and Brazil were among those joining Russia in opposing any attacks without UN backing. Conflict continues to rage in Syria, as men were pictured fleeing flames caused by a bombing in Syria's Idlib province . Devastation: A video obtained from the Shaam News Network showed the bomb's destructive aftermath . The tension between the two key players – Obama and Putin – was palpable. ‘It was not exactly what you would call a debate, more the staking out of positions,’ said one source. The low point came when Cristina Kirchner, the Botoxed Argentine president, droned on for 25 minutes about her country’s history and past wars. Cameron eventually took out his translation earpiece and swung it ostentatiously from his fingers. Afterwards, the weary world leaders trooped outside to watch dancing and fireworks. Following his late-night meeting with Putin, Cameron snatched two hours’ sleep before the second day’s round of tense discussions and tetchy press conferences. On Friday evening, as participants clashed publicly in their final pronouncements, Putin made an alarming pledge to ‘help’ Assad in the event of air strikes. Even for this pugnacious president, it was a gobsmacking response after a gathering of global leaders and following the use of chemical weapons to slaughter civilians. Last time some of these leaders met – at the G8 meeting three months ago on the banks of Lough Erne – Putin cut an isolated figure defending Assad. It came less than a week after the Americans announced plans to provide military support for rebels. The video, authenticated based on its contents and other AP reporting, showed smoke rising from bombardments and clashes between Free Syrian army fighters and government forces in the town of Binnish . This time, however, the Russian leader clearly enjoyed exacting revenge on Cameron and Obama, who after the Northern Irish summit had compared him to ‘a bored kid in the back of the classroom’.As Cameron left St Petersburg he was given a Russian doll with his face on it. Inside, were smaller and smaller dolls of his Downing Street predecessors going back to a tiny Winston Churchill at the core. Was this a kind gift – or one more dig? Meanwhile, a weakened Obama flew back to Washington facing a battle to persuade Congress to authorise military action. Ten of the other G20 nations signed a statement accusing Assad of carrying out the chemical attacks, yet only France among them is offering forces in support. There is no doubt who the biggest losers were after this motley collection of world leaders spent two days  in Tsarist palaces striking poses  over Syria. As Cameron said, there is one new refugee created every 15 seconds in a savage civil war that has left 100,000 people dead – and for all the pontificating in St Petersburg, an end to their plight seems further away than ever.","Plenty of disagreement over dinner in St Petersburg .

"By . Ian Birrell . Leading British Muslim: Javed Khan has been accused of taking an armed gang to settle a dispute in Pakistan . The head of Victim Support, the Government-backed charity for people affected by crime, has been accused of taking an armed gang to settle a long-running land dispute in his native Pakistan. Javed Khan is reported to have arrived in the village of Haveli Bagal last week with about eight men armed with automatic rifles. Witnesses claim that one middle-aged woman who tried to stop the gang from bulldozing a contested wall of the village graveyard was threatened by the charity chief and that shots were fired in the air. Mr Khan spent several hours at a local police station as officers tried to resolve the row. Yesterday, a contempt of court notice was said to have been served, as the dispute was already before a civil court. The events threaten to embarrass Victim Support, which receives £38 million a year from the Government. They may also tarnish the reputation of Mr Khan, 50, who has been cited as one of the most influential British Muslims and is set to begin a new role as chief executive of the children’s charity Barnardo’s later this year. Mr Khan left Pakistan as a small boy when his father brought the family to Britain, but they still own a house and land there. Witnesses in the remote village in the Kashmir region say they saw Mr Khan and his party arrive in two Toyota Land Cruisers. Several of the men were openly carrying automatic weapons, said one shopkeeper. Tempers frayed after the group began using a bulldozer to demolish the disputed boundary wall, which Mr Khan’s family believe encroaches on their land. ‘The community tried to halt them,’ said Ziarab Hussain, one of the village elders leading the protests against the Mr Khan. ‘By the time I reached them, half of the wall was bulldozed. One man was holding a gun against me. I was not aggressive and told them to stop and respect the court order.’ Witnesses say that as tempers rose, the order was given to shoot a middle-aged woman. ‘Her husband stood against the gun, saying let Javed Khan do it himself,’ said a villager. Shots were then fired in the air, the source claimed. Mr Khan in due to start a new role as chief executive of children's charity Barnardo's this year (library image) The confrontation, which was confirmed yesterday by police, was defused after officers arrived at the scene. Inspector Khawaja Qayyum said there had been a dispute but it was now resolved, with a new wall erected on the correct boundary. He added that both sides accused the other of brandishing guns but police did not see any firearms or gunshot wounds. ‘In this area, it is the custom that everyone shows guns in disputes,’ he added. Both Mr Khan and Mr Hussain spent several hours with police.  Villagers allege they were told the matter would be resolved the following day, but instead officers helped Mr Khan, a prominent local figure, rebuild the wall along the lines he wanted the same day. His brother is understood to have visited Haveli Bagal last summer regarding the contested plot. Afterwards, villagers took action in a civil court and it is understood summons were served on the brothers. Mr Khan refused to comment this weekend, although he admitted to being in the village. A Victim Support spokesman said Mr Khan was in Pakistan in a personal capacity, adding: ‘We are making inquiries into local media reports but cannot comment further at this time.’","Javed Khan reported to have arrived in .

Most drivers will know just how annoying, not to mention dangerous, it can be when a motorist driving in the opposite direction blinds them by leaving their full-beam headlights on.

Facebook has also updated its settings so users can choose a neutral pronoun, meaning they are referred to as 'they, their or them'. Scroll down for video . This screen shot released by Facebook shows the new gender option screen. Facebook came up with its range of terms after consulting with leading gay and transgender activists, and the company plans to continue working with them . Facebook rolled out the changes to its more than 159 million monthly users in the U.S. in February. The changes are aimed at giving people more choices in how they describe themselves, such as androgynous, bi-gender, intersex, gender fluid or transsexual. 'There's going to be a lot of people for whom this is going to mean nothing, but for the few it does impact, it means the world,' said Facebook software engineer Brielle Harrison.

'All too often transgender people like myself and other gender nonconforming people are given this binary option, do you want to be male or female? What is your gender?,' said Harrison.

Facebook, which has 1.23 billion active monthly users around the world, also allows them to keep their gender identity private, and will continue to do so. The Human Rights Campaign last year found that 10 percent of the 10,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual transgender youths it surveyed used 'other' or wrote in their own gender terms. When a Facebook user customises their gender, they can also choose a preferred pronoun so that third party apps and messages from Facebook will be addressed in the right way. There is currently no way for advertisers to target specific groups based on the 'custom' settings on Facebook.

'Of course Facebook is entitled to . manage its wildly popular site as it sees fit, but here is the bottom . line: It's impossible to deny the biological reality that humanity is . divided into two halves - male and female,' said Jeff Johnston, an . issues analyst for Focus on the Family, an influential national . religious organisation based in Denver. 'Those petitioning for the change insist that there are an infinite number of genders, but just saying it doesn't make it so. 'That said, we have a great deal of compassion for those who reject their biological sex and believe they are the opposite sex.

In . the past decade, the transgender movement has become much more . organised and outspoken, demanding the kind of civil rights and respect . already sought by gay activists. 'During this time, the transgender . umbrella has been growing well beyond transsexuals to encompass a wide . variety of gender identities.

"By . James Rush . A North Korean official has threatened to launch a nuclear attack on the U.S. after claiming tensions had been ramped up on the Korean peninsula following a series of military drills. Hwang Pyong-So, director of the military's General Political Bureau, described the White House and the Pentagon as 'the sources of all evil' as he warned of attacking the U.S. with nuclear-armed rockets. Speaking at a military rally in Pyongyang on Sunday - the anniversary of the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War - Hwang, vice marshal in the Korean People's Army, said tensions had been raised following a series of drills by the U.S. and South Korea, AFP has reported. Scroll down for video . A North Korean military official has threatened a nuclear attack on the U.S. Pictured is North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un as he arrives for a performance by a national choir at a theatre on Sunday to mark the 61st anniversary of the signing of the armistice agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War . Hwang Pyong-So, director of the military's General Political Bureau, described the White House and the Pentagon as 'the sources of all evil'. Picture shows celebrations on Sunday for the 61st anniversary  of the armistice that ended the Korean War, in Pyongyang, North Korea . Hwang said: 'If the U.S. imperialists threaten our sovereignty and survival... our troops will fire our nuclear-armed rockets at the White House and the Pentagon - the sources of all evil.' It is widely believed North Korea does not possess the military capability to launch a nuclear attack on the U.S. It has however been testing a higher number of weapons this year than previously. On Saturday it fired a short-range ballistic missile into waters off its east coast, a South Korean defence official said. The missile, fired from North Korea's southwest Hwanghae province on Saturday evening, flew about 500 kilometers (310 miles) across the country before landing in the sea, the official said, according to AP. North Korea routinely test-fires missiles, artillery and rockets, but the number of weapons tests it has conducted this year is much higher than previous years. Service personnel of North Korean Army at the plaza of the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang, on Sunday, the 61st anniversary of the armistice that ended the Korean War . Outside analysts say this indicates that North Korea's young leader, Kim Jong-Un, is handling things differently than his late father, Kim Jong-Il, who used longer-range missile and nuclear tests sparingly, as negotiating cards with the outside world to win concessions. Analysts also say Kim Jong-Un won't order troops to stop testing weapons unless rival South Korea and the U.S. make a major concession such as downsizing their regular joint military drills or conducting them in a low-key manner. Pyongyang calls the drills by Seoul and Washington a rehearsal for invasion, though the allies say they have no intention of attacking North Korea. Annual summertime exercises by South Korean and U.S. troops are slated for next month. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un inspects a 'rocket-firing drill' on Saturday . Despite its continuing weapons tests, North Korea also has sent mixed signals by proposing measures that it says would lower tensions with the South, such as halting mutual slandering. South Korean officials have rebuffed the North's overture, arguing that the North must first demonstrate how serious it is about nuclear disarmament. North Korea is seen by foreign observers as pushing for better ties with South Korea and other countries as a way to lure international investment and aid to revive the country's stagnant economy. The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the July 27, 1953, armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War has yet to be replaced by a peace treaty. The U.S. has about 28,500 troops in South Korea to deter potential aggression from the North.","Hwang Pyong-So made the warning following South Korea and U.S. drills .

"By . Tim Shipman . and Ian Birrell . Vladmir Putin put the world on course for a new Cold War yesterday, annexing Crimea and telling the West to get out of Russia’s back yard. As Russia was accused of war crimes after the death of a Ukrainian soldier, Putin defiantly told a joint session of the Russian  parliament that he would not accept Western influence ‘next to our home or on our historic territories’. And in a stark warning that Ukraine risks dismemberment if it seeks to join the EU or Nato, he said he would not tolerate Western countries ‘behaving as the master of the house outside our fence’. Scroll down for video . Russian President Vladimir Putin signs a treaty for Crimea to join Russia . Russian President Vladimir Putin (second right), Crimea's Prime Minister Sergei Aksyonov (front left), Crimean parliamentary speaker Vladimir Konstantinov (back left) and Sevastopol Mayor Alexei Chaliy shake hands after a signing ceremony at the Kremlin in Moscow . An emotional Putin signed a document . reclaiming Crimea and declared: ‘In the hearts and minds of people, . Crimea has always been and remains an inseparable part of Russia.’ The . speech sent shockwaves through the international community and appeared . to have upended two decades of diplomacy since the fall of the Soviet . Union designed to imbed Russia as a member of the international . community. It came as a . Ukrainian officer and a member of a local Crimean self-defence brigade . were shot dead when pro-Russian militia stormed a military outpost in . the Crimean capital of Simferopol. Adoring public: Putin was last night riding the crest of an adulatory wave after righting what many Russians see as an historical wrong and reintegrating Crimea and the Black Sea fleet headquarters of Sevastopol . Nationalistic fervour: Dozens of Russian flags flutter in the breeze below a typically overcast Moscow sky . Ukrainian . Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said the storming of the military . facility showed that the dispute ‘has gone from the political stage to . the military by the fault of the Russians’. He . added: ‘Today, Russian soldiers began shooting at Ukrainian servicemen . and this is a war crime without any statute of limitations.’ David . Cameron yesterday condemned the decision to annex Crimea ‘on the basis . of a sham referendum held at the barrel of a Russian gun’. On the crest of a wave: Russian President Vladimir Putin stands next to Crimean Premier Sergey Aksionov as he addresses a rally in Red Square, Moscow, celebrating  Crimea's decision to join with Russia .

Mr Aksionov, the new Crimean premier, raises his fist as he shares the stage with Speaker of the Supreme Council of Crimea Vladimir Konstantinov, left, and head of Sevastopol city administration Alexei Chaliy, right . He . said: ‘The steps taken by President Putin today to attempt to annex . Crimea to Russia are in flagrant breach of international law and send a . chilling message across the continent of Europe. ‘President Putin should be in no doubt that Russia will face more serious consequences.’ The . Prime Minister will call on fellow EU leaders to bring in a new round . of tougher economic sanctions, plus an arms embargo, when they meet at a . Brussels summit tomorrow. Branding . the crisis ‘the most serious test of European security in the 21st . century’, Foreign Secretary William Hague made clear that two decades of . reaching out to Russia were at an end and that relations were likely to . dive. Foreign Secretary . William Hague said Britain had suspended all military co-operation with . Moscow. Suggesting Russia should be kicked out of the G8 group of . nations, he said: ‘We should be ready to contemplate a new state of . relations between Russia and the West in the coming years that is . different from the last 20 years.’ Last . night, Russian politicians and media were telling  Putin to grab back . oil and gas-rich Kazakhstan and authoritarian Belarus as well as more . slices of a battered Ukraine. Senior politician Sergei Mironov hailed ‘the great day when the gathering of Russian lands began’. Adolf Hitler made a spookily similar speech to Putin when he seized the Sudetenland, making similar references to common themes . The uncompromising autocrat got to his feet and made a bombastic speech as he seized a part of a neighbouring state dominated by his own countrymen. It came in the midst of a referendum condemned by other powers as a sham, with voters intimidated by the autocrat’s looming tanks. The move was greeted with delirious pleasure by his own citizens but seen as a portent of international strife by other Western countries. The despot in question is not Vladimir Putin but Adolf Hitler. The occasion was not the annexation of Crimea but the Nazi  seizure of the Sudetenland, the German-speaking part of Czechoslovakia. Putin, who spoke to the Russian parliament yesterday, appears to have stolen many of the themes of his speech from the Fuhrer’s address to the Reichstag as he seized the Sudetenland in October 1938. Putin said Crimea had always been Russian: ‘In people’s hearts and minds, Crimea has always been an integral part of Russia.’ Hitler said of the Sudetenland: ‘The  Sudeten German population was and is a German.’ Putin insisted he would fight for Russians everywhere. Hitler’s imagery was also emotive. ‘More than 1,000,000 people of German blood had in the years 1919-1920 to leave their homeland.’ Putin criticised Western nations, and  Hitler complained that his efforts to reach out to the West were rebuffed.Putin said Russia would retaliate against Western sanctions. Hitler said: ‘As a National Socialist, I am accustomed to strike back at an attacker.’ Putin claimed he would not invade other parts of Eastern Ukraine if Russia was allowed to exercise influence: ‘Don’t believe those who try to frighten you with Russia and who scream that other (Ukrainian) regions will follow after Crimea. We do not want a partition of Ukraine.’ Hitler also claimed that his ambitions would stop at the Sudetenland. ‘I have declared that the frontier between France and Germany is a final one. Germany has no interests in the West.’ Five months later, he invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia; 14 months after that, he invaded France.","Putin signs bill to annexe Crimea and pull territory back into Russia .

"By . James Rush . A rare script with an alternative ending for the Hollywood classic Gone With The Wind has emerged 75 years after the movie's release. The 1939 film, starring Vivien Leigh as heroine Scarlett O'Hara and Clark Gable as her lover Rhett Butler, is widely regarded as one of the greatest of all time and is still the most successful at the box office, once inflation is taken into account. The ending of the American Civil War movie sees a heart-broken Scarlett resolving to get on with life after being left by Rhett, and is celebrated for its portrayal of Leigh's character as a strong, independent woman. The emergence of the alternate script however has revealed it could have ended on a very different note. A rare script featuring an alternative ending to the classic Gone With The Wind is set to go up for auction in Texas . The 1939 film, starring Vivien Leigh as heroine Scarlett O'Hara and Clark Gable as her lover Rhett Butler, is widely regarded as one of the greatest of all time . In the alternative version, instead of speaking the famous resolute line 'After all, tomorrow is another day', Scarlett appears much more distraught, calling after her lover 'Rhett!... Rhett!... You'll come back. You'll come back... I know you will!' It is the first time a script with this ending has emerged for sale. Gone with the Wind took $390million at the box office, the highest grossing film of its time, and still the most successful film ever made if adjusted for inflation. Leigh, who was married to Laurence Olivier from 1940 to 1960, won an Oscar for her portrayal of Scarlett O'Hara while Gable was nominated for best actor. The 251-page script is thought to have belonged to a production member and was acquired by a film fan who ran a book shop in Hollywood. It has been tipped to fetch as much as $5,000 (£3,000) when it goes under the hammer at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas. The 251-page script is thought to have belonged to a production member and was acquired by a film fan who ran a book shop in Hollywood . Margaret Barrett, head of entertainment at Heritage, said: 'What's really interesting about this script is that it has an alternative ending to the one in the film. 'During the making of the film the makers played around with several different endings but eventually settled on the one we all know where Scarlett O'Hara speaks the famous line ""After all, tomorrow is another day"". 'The various endings are known of among the most dedicated film fans but this script just serves as proof of the changes the director made during production. 'In the original ending Scarlett comes across as a strong, determined woman who will survive with or without Rhett, but this alternative ending is much more traditional - her life has been ruined because her man left her. 'Scarlett is such an enduring character because she is so independent. She was way ahead of her time in terms of how women were viewed. Leigh, who was married to Laurence Olivier from 1940 to 1960, won an Oscar for her portrayal of Scarlett O'Hara while Gable was nominated for best actor . 'This alternate ending shows her life is going to be about getting Rhett Butler back whereas in the original she is sad to see him go but it's not the be all and end all. 'I think the directors made the right decision sticking with the original ending because it best shows Scarlett's true character - she was a fighter and that's why we all love her so much.

"By . Daniel Martin . Ranbir Singh Suri, who is chairman of the Oceanic Jewellers Ltd, is to be made a Lord, it has emerged . The row over ‘cash for peerages’ was reignited last night after it emerged a jewellery tycoon who has handed the Tories more than £300,000 is to be made a Lord. Ranbir Singh Suri – last night nicknamed the ‘King of Bling’ by Labour sources – was nominated by David Cameron. The Prime Minister has already handed out 161 peerages in this parliament. The announcement that another political crony is to be handed a peerage will lead to further calls for the controversial system of patronage which persists in this country to be scrapped. About 20 new peers are expected to be announced today, swelling the total to 850, making the House of Lords bigger than at any time since most of the hereditaries were removed in 1999. And it emerged that the expenses bill for the House of Lords has risen by more than £4million since 2010. According to Lords figures, the cost of peers’ allowances has risen from to £21.6million from £17.2million before the 2010 election. The new peers will increase the bill even further. Based on an average expense claim of £28,000, they could add £600,000 to the bill. Constitutional experts warn that the handing of peerages to dozens of political allies and donors is ‘unsustainable’. Paul Flynn, Labour member of the public administration select committee, said: ‘Our legislature is being prostituted; jobs are being given out to the highest donors. ‘The Lords is overcrowded as it is, only two thirds of them can get in.’ About half of the 20 or so peerages to be announced tomorrow will be for the Conservatives. The Prime Minister is expected to hand peerages to Apprentice star Karren Brady and former M&S boss Sir Stuart Rose. Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg will also name peers to represent Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the Lords – leading to claims they are being promoted to act as ‘lobby fodder’. Scroll down for video . David Cameron is preparing to announce up to 20 new appointments to the House of Lords tomorrow . Former M&S boss Sir Stuart Rose and West Ham vice-chairman and Apprentice star Karren Brady are expected to become peers in the new list of nominations . Ed Miliband will name former EastEnders actor and Labour MEP Michael Cashman, while Nick Clegg is expected to name a total of six. Last night Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: ‘It is absurd to keep adding to our overblown second chamber through nominations from the PM – particularly as many of the nominees seem to be big donors to the Conservatives. ‘No other second chamber in the Western World is so large. Every democrat should be pressing for a reform of the House of Lords as a matter of urgency.’ While the very idea of parties cramming the Upper House with political appointees is controversial, the idea that donors should be given seats is even more so. It has also been rumoured that Michael Farmer, a City financier who has donated more than £2.3million to the Tories since 2002, is also in line for a peerage. He was appointed the Tory co-treasurer in 2012. Ranbir Singh Suri is chairman of Oceanic Jewellers Ltd and founder of the British Asian Conservative Link, which aimed to encourage those with an Asian background to get involved in politics. Official figures show that since 2010 the bill for peers' expenses has risen from £17.2 million to £21.6million . Former Eastenders actor Michael Cashman, a Labour MEP since 1999, is expected to be nominated as a peer by Ed Miliband . Since 2006 he has donated £129,380 to the Conservative party, while his company has given them another £183,055. Reported to be worth £40million, he has been a Tory member for more than 30 years. Tory sources said he was a leading figure in the Sikh community who had served as a magistrate for a decade and a half. He was also a successful businessman who employs dozens. He will join Miss Brady, who last year introduced Chancellor George Osborne before his speech to the party’s annual conference. Now the 44-year-old vice-chairman of West Ham football club, she was working as an advertising executive for radio station LBC when she was hired by Sunday Sport publisher David Sullivan. Mr Sullivan made his fortune through adult magazines before founding the downmarket newspaper in 1986. At the age of 23, she was made managing director of Birmingham FC after Mr Sullivan and his business partner David Gold took over the football club in 1993. She remained there until 2009.","Ranbir Singh Suri, chairman of the Oceanic Jewellers Ltd, to get peerage .

"By . Ashley Collman . A Hurricane, Utah mother is wracked with guilt at the death of her 11-month-old daughter, whom she accidentally left in the car for hours on Friday during 90-degree weather. Skyah Suwyn was just one week short of her first birthday when mother April Suwyn broke her normal routine and brought her beloved daughter along in the car to drop off her two young sons with a babysitter. But the urgent need to use the restroom meant April parked her car and rushed back into her home, leaving Skyah behind in the hot parked car. It was only when she went back to the car around 1pm that she noticed her grave mistake. Scroll down for video . Tragic loss: April Suwyn, 32 (right), is left reeling after the loss of her 11-month-old daughter Skyah (left) who she left in a hot parked car for hours on Friday . Too young: Baby Skyah was the only daughter of Micah (left) and April Suwyn (right). She was just one week shy of celebrating her first birthday when she was pronounced dead from apparent heat exhaustion. Pictured above with her parents and two older brothers . Paramedics life-flighted Skyah in extremely critical condition to Dixie Regional Medical Center where she was pronounced dead. Skyah became the twentieth child to die of heatstroke after being left in a car this year, in a tragic recurrence that has claimed the lives of about 38 each year since 1998. Neither April or her husband Micah have made statements regarding their only daughter's death, but April's sister and a family friend have spoken to the press in their defense. 'It was an accident,' a crying Aimee Wright, April's sister, told the Deseret News. 'If people who are being negative could even see how hard she is on herself. If they could see that she keeps saying, ""If only. If only. If only. I wouldn't have been out of my routine that day. If only I had gone to the gym."" She blames it all on herself.' Inconsolable: Aprils sister Aimee Wright says the family is completely heartbroken at the loss . Saddening: Above, a view of the neighborhood where Skyah was found after several hours in a hot parked car . Wright says that Skyah's death was the result of a change of routine for her sister, who usually has a neighbor look after her daughter while she takes the boys to a babysitter. But she decided to take Skyah along for the ride that day. There was construction going on in the neighborhood so Mrs Suwyn had to park a few blocks away from her home, where she does nails in her in-house salon while watching Skyah. Mrs Suwyn rushed out of the car after parking, since she needed to use the restroom, and went about her day under the impression she took Skyah out of the car and put her down for nap as usual. She found her daughter hours later when she went back to the car to pick up her sons. Fatal error: April usually has a neighbor look after her daughter (center) while she drops her two sons (right and left) off with a babysitter. But on Friday, she broke routine and brought her daughter along for the ride. The three Suwyn pictured above, with a much younger Skyah . Distracted: Because of construction in the neighborhood, April had to park several blocks away from her house. And because she urgently needed to use the restroom, she rushed out of the car leaving baby Skyah behind. Mother and daughter pictured above in a shot from dad Micah's Facebook page . The incident is under investigation by local police, and as of Saturday no criminal charges has been pressed against April. Authorities are investigating these cases more seriously after the death of a Georgia toddler in similar circumstances this past June. Prosecutors say the boy's father, Justin Ross Harris, left him alone on purpose after finding suspicious web searches on his computer. 'This incident is very tragic and our hearts go out to those involved, especially the family,' the Hurricane police said in s statement on Skyah's death. 'The temperature in a vehicle can rise substantially very quickly, which makes it a very dangerous situation.' Sweltering: The temperature when Skyah was found on Friday was 90 degrees. Skyah and her mother pictured above spending the day by a river . But those close to the Suwyn family say there's no question Skyah's death was an accident. 'They loved her so much,' family friend Lacie Van Dam told KSL. 'They never, never set her down. She was just...everybody loved her.' Ms Van Dam went on to call her friend April a 'fantasic mom' who' loves her children more than anything in the world. However, some have lashed out at the mother online for causing her own daughter's death. April's sister and Ms Van Dam have urged these people to stop, since the family is already torn up with guilty. 'She doesn't need the negative. It's eating her away. It's eating the family away. She's a good mom and she made one simple mistake that she'd take back in a heartbeat,' Wright said. Many are reaching out to the family however, with an online crowdfunding campaign and Facebook support page. A campaign on Go Fund Me had raised over $11,000 as of Sunday night, while those close to the Suwyns and strangers have rallied on Facebook to show their love.","Skyah Suwyn was left inside a hot parked car for hours on Friday, while her mother worked at home painting nails .

Opah, also known as Moonfish, are a rare catch  and three at once is even more of a surprise since they don't often travel in packs . Opah, also known as Moonfish, are a rare catch for recreational fisherman since they don't travel in schools and therefore aren't commercially fished either. Instead, most are caught accidentally by fisherman looking for other fish, such as tuna. That's what the group was looking for last week when they came across the three opah in one day. Opah also aren't known to stray often into southern California waters, preferring warmer waters in tropical and sub-tropical seas.

At the time of the article, Snodgrass had tags on four opah in the region, to observe their swimming and diving patterns.

"By . Ashley Collman . The cheap Albuquerque, New Mexico motel that Bill Gates and Paul Allen called home in the early days of Microsoft now has a new life as affordable housing. The future billionaires checked into the Sundowner Hotel in 1975, the same year they founded Microsoft, but the once popular motor hotel was by then just a shadow of its former glory. The motel officially closed five years ago when it was overtaken by squatters, prostitutes and drug users. The birthplace of Microsoft: The Albuquerque, New Mexico motel that housed Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 as they were developing Microsoft has now been turned into affordable housing. Above, views of the hotel during its heyday. But a company has since purchased the building and given it a makeover, turning the motel into an affordable apartment complex housing the mentally ill, students and working families. Originally opened in 1960, the Sundowner was once a glimmering motel on America's famous Route 66. In it's heyday, locals and out-of-towners alike flocked to stay at the Sundowner, with it's pool, casino, nightclub and restaurant. But when Interstate 40 was completed in 1970, traffic slowed on the famous roadway and the hotel fell into disrepair. Early days: Paul Allen (left) and Bill Gates (right) pictured in 1981, six years after founding their ground-breaking company . John Bloomfield, executive director of New Life Homes, visited the motel in 2009 and called the trip 'an emotional encounter'.

The motel was resdesigned by Garret Smith Ltd and construction started in April 2013. The Sundowner has since been turned into 71 units, ranging from studios to three-bedroom apartments. The property now includes a sand volleyball court, garden and gazebo with a special display case explaining the Microsoft history.
