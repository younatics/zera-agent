"(CNN) -- The Guinness World Records Book 2011 lists the CBS soap opera ""The Bold and The Beautiful"" as the ""most popular soap opera -- current"" for its success not only at home, but abroad. The show can be seen in more than 110 countries and garnered 24.5 million viewers across the globe in 2008, making it more watched than any other telenovela or soap opera on television, according to Guinness. Too bad daytime dramas aren't doing as well in the United States. As fans mourn the impending loss of long-running soap operas ""All My Children"" and ""One Life to Live,"" such dramas in other countries and in other languages are thriving. In Ireland, fans are closely following the trials and tribulations of the Bishops on ""Fair City,"" while there's plenty of drama being stirred up in Munich on the popular German soap, ""Lindenstra√üe."" Audiences in the United Kingdom have been enthralled with ""EastEnders"" since it debuted in 1985 and the Dutch get their soapy fix with ""Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden,"" or ""Good Times, Bad Times."" ""Home and Away"" in Australia offers plenty of crickey, hard-bodied, soapy action while the Belgians enjoy ""Thuis""  (""At Home""). Even in America, the Hispanic telenovelas are racking up ratings that most soaps would envy. Sam Ford, co-editor of the book ""The Survival of Soap Opera,"" said part of the issue could be a matter of timing. ""Soap operas are considered part of daytime (TV) here and they are considered part of prime time (TV) in many other areas,"" he said. ""When U.S. soaps air elsewhere, when British and Australian soaps air and when telenovelas air, a good portion of them air at night and they don't necessarily have some of the same stigmas of daytime programming in the U.S."" Despite their vaunted place in American television history, soaps have not always received the praise or recognition of their night time counterparts. Many of the original television soap operas began as radio programs which made the leap to the small screen in the 1950s and 1960s when the country had a very different landscape. Advertisers rushed to get onboard with the hopes of snagging the interest -- and dollars -- of the stay-at-home mothers who watched the programs. By the 1980s, the shows experienced a pop culture revival with the help of characters like Luke and Laura on ""General Hospital"" and gave several major stars their first break in the business. According to The Guardian, when Luke and Laura married in 1981, 14 million viewers tuned in to watch, while now the soap averages an audience between 2.5 to 3 million. But the long-running nature of the soaps, where fans can literally check back in years later and catch right up, is not playing as well with today's viewers. Lynn Leahey, editor of Soap Opera Digest, told The Guardian that shifting viewer demographics are to blame. ""Women are not at home in the same numbers they used to be,"" she said. ""Mothers used to pass the soap-watching bug on to their daughters -- that just doesn't happen now."" Instead, today's soaps are competing with the drama of reality television shows and the time suck that can be social networking. That craving for a storyline is still there and Peter Tinoco, president and chief executive officer of Venevision Productions, said telenovela audiences enjoy that weaving of a tale. ""There is a difference between our telenovela and the soap operas in the United States,"" he said. ""The soap operas in the United States are ongoing while our telenovelas are like if you were reading a book which has a beginning and an ending and through it people try to live the life of the protagonist. I think the success is in having a beginning and an ending because people don't get tired of watching something."" Tinoco's company is the producer of the telenovela, ""Eva Luna,"" which is the highest-rated domestically produced telenovela. The show recently presented its grand finale on the Univision network which drew more than 9.7 million viewers, according to Nielsen data. ""Eva Luna"" also did gangbusters in Latin American countries, Tinoco said, a testament to the cultural importance of such shows in the Hispanic community. The history of the telenovela began decades ago, Tinoco said, with illustrators producing comic book-style pamphlets of operas and plays that the poor population in Latin American countries couldn't afford to attend. From there, telenovelas share a history with soaps in that the stories morphed into radio programs and later television shows, he said. Tinoco said the popularity of telenovelas in the U.S. are a mirror of the success they have found in Latin America where every channel has multiple series. When one ends, a new one takes its place and audiences follow, he said. ""They are very basic,"" he said. ""It's a love story, even if it has a little bit of suspense or a little bit of comedy; they always involve a love story."" Daniela Guevara, with the Hispanic marketing firm Lanza Group told CNN she understands the appeal of the telenovelas. ""I'm not surprised to see the success because it's something that the Hispanic community has grown up with,"" she said. ""It's part of our family, part of our life, since we're younger, family, grandparents, parents, brothers, sisters. So I'm not surprised."" The popularity of the telenovelas is expected to increase. According to Nielsen data ""by 2050, Hispanics are projected to account for more than 30% of the U.S. population"" and that number will be reflected in the ratings. ""The Hispanic consumer represents the greatest potential for sustained growth in the U.S. today,"" said a recent Nielsen report titled ""What You Think You Know vs. What You Need to Know about U.S. Hispanics and Media."" ""At the current rate of expansion, Hispanics will drive population growth and, in turn, consumption in America for the next generation."" So while the future looks brighter for telenovelas, soap operas appear to be in their winter of discontent. Soap actor Tristan Rogers said in Sam Ford's book that the shows, which now are down to only four left out of 20 in years past, are on their way out. ""This is not a genre that will be around in another 50 years,"" Rogers said. ""In many respects, it isn't necessary. They have made their mark, and almost every type of medium owes something to the way the soaps have been put together, whether they want to admit it or not."" Editor Ford, who has written about the demise of American soaps for Fast Company, said whether or not American soaps are headed for extinction in the short term remains to be seen. ""Ultimately that will be up to the networks and the advertisers,"" he said. ""There are four (soap operas) still on the air in the U.S. and that's 20 hours week. There are plenty of other genres on TV that don't have that much programming."" CNN's Rafael Romo contributed to this report .","American soap operas often pull larger audiences abroad .

"(CNN) -- Medical examiners will conduct an autopsy Monday on ""Glee"" actor Cory Monteith. Staffers at the Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel in Vancouver, Canada, discovered the 31-year-old actor's body in his hotel room Saturday after he missed his checkout time, police said. ""The coroner's service has decided that we will conduct an autopsy and toxicology testing on Cory to make sure that we do have the best possible information to determine the cause of death,"" B.C. Coroner's Service spokeswoman Barbara McLintock said Monday. While the cause of death was not immediately apparent, police have ruled out the possibility of foul play. In his own words . Monteith had been public about his struggle with addiction and checked into a rehab facility in late March. ""It's all about perseverance. Absolute perseverance. You can always get back up,"" he told Glamour magazine in June. Celebrities react to Monteith's death . It was his second stint in a treatment facility. Monteith played Finn in the popular Fox series, and credited ""Glee's"" success with helping him to turn his life around. ""It always blows my mind to think about how it was just a Fox pilot that started so humbly a couple of years ago"" the actor told GoldDerby in June 2012. The Facebook page RIP Cory Monteith had more than 669,000 likes early Monday morning, an indication of how popular the actor was with fans of the show. The ""Glee"" staff released a statement via Twitter early Sunday morning, saying, ""We are deeply saddened by this tragic news. Cory was an exceptional talent and an even more exceptional person."" Share your memories of Monteith . Monteith's on- and off-screen girlfriend Lea Michele, who plays Rachel Berry on the show, has not yet released a statement. Her representatives asked Sunday ""that everyone kindly respect Lea's privacy during this devastating time."" The statement added that the actress was ""devastated"" by the news. The couple had been dating for more than a year. In April, Michele voiced her support for Monteith's decision to enter rehab, telling People magazine. ""I love and support Cory and will stand by him through this."" Remembering Monteith as Finn on 'Glee' Adam Shankman, who directed an episode of ""Glee"" for each of the past three seasons, told CNN's Poppy Harlow that he had talked to Monteith on Saturday morning. Shankman said Monteith was the glue of ""Glee."" ""I had several interactions with him (Saturday) where he said that he was doing amazing,"" Shankman said. ""He even said I am feeling fantastic.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A first attempt to plug a cracked concrete shaft that is leaking highly radioactive water into the ocean off Japan failed Saturday, so officials are now exploring alternatives, spokesmen for Tokyo Electric Power Co. said. Power plant workers had been trying to fill the shaft with fresh concrete, but that did not change the amount of water coming out of the crack, the spokesmen said at a news conference that ran late into the night Saturday. Their ""plan B"" is to use polymers to stop the leak, the spokesmen said. A Tokyo Electric expert will visit the site Sunday morning and decide what polymer to use before the work begins. Workers will then break the shaft's ceiling and insert the polymer in a different spot from where they tried to place the concrete, they said. Water from the 2-meter-deep, concrete-lined basin has been seen escaping into the ocean through a roughly 20-centimeter (8-inch) crack, the company said earlier Saturday. The shaft lies behind the turbine plant of the No. 2 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, which was heavily damaged in the earthquake and resulting tsunami last month. Radiation levels in the shaft have been measured at more than 1,000 millisieverts per hour, which is more than 330 times the dose an average resident of an industrialized country naturally receives in a year. Radioactivity above the shaft was measured at 250 millisieverts per hour, said Tokyo Electric, the plant's owner. Tokyo Electric said it is discussing other methods to use should the polymer fail, but it hasn't identified what those other methods may be. The discovery of the leak comes after a feverish effort in recent days to explain a sharp spike in contamination in seawater measured just off the plant. Tokyo Electric said the shaft lies next to the water intake for the plant's steam condenser, at the end of a long channel that has been filling with radioactive water for several days. Officials announced Thursday, based on samples taken the previous afternoon 330 meters (361 yards) off the plant, that seawater showed levels of iodine-131 measuring 4,385 times above the standard and cesium-137 at 527 times beyond normal. Experts say the latter radioactive isotope may be a greater concern because it persists longer, since it takes 30 years to lose half its radiation -- compared to an eight-day half-life for the iodine-131 isotope. While officials know the radioactive water is coming from the cracked pipe, they don't yet know where it originates. The ratio of the two isotopes in the seawater samples, combined with the discovery of the cracked shaft itself, supports the idea that the radioactivity is coming from the reactor and not the spent fuel pools at the plant, said Gary Was, a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Michigan. Hunting down the source of the leak inside the reactor, however, is ""exceptionally challenging"" because officials must inspect a complicated array of pipes inside the dangerous radioactive environment that now exists within the containment building, said physicist James Acton, an associate in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency ordered Tokyo Electric to start testing water farther offshore and to the south, agency official Hidehiko Nishiyama said. The utility has now established monitoring posts 15 kilometers (9.5 miles) off the coast, in a line directly offshore, 10 kilometers south, and 16 kilometers south. Highly radioactive water has also been detected in several reactors' turbine buildings, nearby tunnels and groundwater in the immediate vicinity. But the area around the No. 2 reactor has been of particular concern, because water in an exposed maintenance tunnel leading from its turbine building showed radiation levels more than 100,000 times above typical levels for nuclear coolants. A two-day project began Saturday to install a camera in that trench to help pinpoint potential leaks, a Tokyo Electric official said. Spraying was also set to continue this weekend of an experimental new material to lock in radioactive material in and around the nuclear complex so that it doesn't seep further into the air, water or ground. Crews have dispersed about 2,000 liters (more than 500 gallons) of synthetic resin in a 500-square-meter locale, according to Tokyo Electric. The aim is to hold the released radioactivity on the ground, so it can't interfere with the restoration of the cooling systems aimed at preventing the overheating of nuclear fuel rods in reactors and spent fuel pools at the plant. ""You spray it to hold down the loose contamination, and it acts like a super glue,"" said Nolan Hertel, a radiation engineering expert at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. ""You don't want radioactive materials that are loose to get away."" Meanwhile, Nishiyama said there is a plan to inject nonflammable nitrogen into reactors 1, 2 and 3 to prevent the risk of another hydrogen explosion like the ones that extensively damaged the unit 1 and 3 housings in the days following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. A buildup of hydrogen is an early sign of damage to a reactor's superheated core, but Nishiyama said no alarms had been sounded about rising pressure and that adding nitrogen would not force engineers to release hydrogen from the reactor vessel. The nitrogen injection is only to prevent hydrogen from accumulating, he said. ""If the hydrogen concentration can be kept below about 4%, then it reduces the risk of an explosion,"" explained Was. ""So dilution with nitrogen, which doesn't support combustion, makes sense."" The continued injection of tons of water into the reactor cores and spent nuclear fuel pools shows that the race to prevent further explosions or widespread releases of radiation into the atmosphere remains far from over. ""I think the biggest concern here is what's going on in the reactor cores,"" said James Acton, of the Carnegie Endowment. ""Keeping those cores cool is still the single most important task facing the plant operators at the moment."" Jeff Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric Co., was heading to Japan to meet with Tokyo Electric about stabilizing the damaged reactors, which were designed by GE, company spokeswoman Deidre Latour said Saturday. All these efforts come just more than three weeks after a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck northeast Japan, effectively wiping out some communities and leading to the deaths of nearly 12,000 people and leaving more than 15,400 missing, according to Japan's National Police Agency. The Fukushima Daiichi plant was hit hard in the disaster, especially after its primary and back-up systems to cool nuclear fuel in its six reactors and their respective spent nuclear fuel pools failed. Since then, there has been a multifaceted and at times problematic race to prevent explosions (three took place in the days immediately after March 11), the overheating of nuclear fuel and the resulting release of radioactive material into the air, soil and water. By Saturday, concerns seem to have abated somewhat about the airborne radiation that led to the ordered evacuation of 78,000 people, with another 62,000 living within 20 to 30 kilometers being told to stay indoors. An official with Tokyo Electric said early Saturday that data from eight new monitoring posts around the plant showed airborne radiation levels had stabilized, at between .390 and .0019 millisieverts per hour. Saturday -- after a stop in Rikuzentakata, in Iwate prefecture -- Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan went to Hironocho, a village in Fukushima prefecture that has served as the operations center for the nuclear crisis effort. The trip, described by the prime minister's office as aimed at boosting morale among utility company workers and soldiers involved in the effort, put Kan on the edge of the 20-kilometer evacuation zone. ""I appreciate your significant contributions in fighting the invisible enemies in this battle, which will determine the fate of Japan,"" Kan said at J-Village, a soccer complex that has become a staging area for the Fukushima Daiichi operation. CNN's Tsukushi Ikeda, Yoko Wakatsuki, Junko Ogura, Rich Phillips, Midori Nakata and Susan Olson contributed to this report .","Efforts to plug the leak with concrete failed Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Before making judgments about the shootings at Fort Hood, a thorough investigation needs to take place, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said Thursday. ""It is imperative that we take the time to gather all the facts, as it would be irresponsible to be the source of rumors or inaccurate information regarding such a horrific event,"" Cornyn said in a statement. ""Once we have ascertained all the facts, working with our military leaders and law enforcement officials on the ground, we can determine what exactly happened at Fort Hood today and how to prevent something like this from ever happening again,"" he said. Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, shot and killed 11 soldiers and one civilian, officials said. Thirty-one people were wounded, officials at the Army base said. A federal official said Hasan is a U.S. citizen of Jordanian descent. Cornyn, a Republican, said people should not jump to conclusions about what happened and why. ""We do not yet have these details,"" the statement said. President Obama, who was speaking at a conference in Washington, said his administration ""will make sure that we get answers to every single question about this horrible incident."" He asked Americans to keep the soldiers and families of Fort Hood in the thoughts and prayers. Former President George W. Bush, who was governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000 and lives in Crawford about 20 miles from the post, expressed his family's sorrow. ""I was saddened to learn of the tragic incident at Fort Hood. Laura and I are keeping the victims and their families in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time,"" he said. iReport.com: Are you there? Send pics, video . Two prominent Muslim organizations condemned the shootings. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, based in Washington, said there was no reason for such violence. ""We condemn this cowardly attack in the strongest terms possible and ask that the perpetrators be punished to the full extent of the law,"" a statement from the organization said. ""No political or religious ideology could ever justify or excuse such wanton and indiscriminate violence."" The Muslim Public Affairs Council offered its sympathy to the victims and their families. ""MPAC and the Muslim American community unequivocally condemn this heinous incident,"" said a statement from the Los Angeles, California, based group. ""Our entire organization extends its heartfelt condolences to the families of those killed as well as to those wounded and their loved ones."" The group said it was working with law enforcement and government officials. ""American Muslims stand with our fellow citizens in offering both prayers for the victims and sincere condolences to the families of those killed or injured,"" the statement said. The Secretary of the Army said that while an investigation will come, the well-being of his soldiers was the Army's first concern. ""This is a terrible tragedy that we will know more about in the coming days. For now, our focus is squarely on taking care of our soldiers and their families,"" said John M. McHugh in a statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those who have been killed and wounded. The leadership at Fort Hood is marshalling the medical support and counselors necessary to take care of our soldiers and their families and to notify the next of kin."" Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas said her heart went out to the people affected by the violence. ""Our dedicated military personnel have sacrificed so much in service to our country, and it sickens me that the men and women of Fort Hood have been subjected to this senseless, random violence,"" said Hutchison, a Republican.

"(CNN) -- A movie about the early life of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs premiered Friday night at the Sundance Film Festival to mixed reviews, with some critics saying it presents a fawning, one-sided portrait of the late tech icon. ""jOBS"" stars Ashton Kutcher in the title role and dramatizes selected highlights of Jobs' life, from his formative months at Reed College to the 1984 debut of the Macintosh to the triumphant unveiling of the iPod in 2001. Co-starring Josh Gad (""1600 Penn,"" ""The Book of Mormon"") as business partner Steve Wozniak, the film focuses on Jobs' celebrated role in pioneering the personal computer. ""Over and over again, minor characters explain to him why something can't be done; Kutcher-as-Jobs smiles enigmatically and waves away their concerns,"" writes Casey Newton for CNET. ""Each time, he speaks of how the technology Apple is building will improve the lives of average people. Co-workers argue with him, but they never get anywhere, because their parts are poorly written and the filmmakers have no interest in showing their subject being wrong about his work,"" Newton continues. ""(A)ll Apple failures in 'jOBS' are portrayed as the result of conservative, backward-thinking executives beholden only to their shareholders. The result is that the viewer spends two hours watching cardboard cutouts lose arguments to Ashton Kutcher."" Matthew Panzarino of The Next Web has a more charitable view of the movie. ""There will be those who will attack the accuracy of the film, and there are plenty of chances to do so. Significant swaths of technical development of the Macintosh and Lisa computers are simply not present,"" he writes. ""But, overall, 'jOBS' works. ... This isn't going to be the canonical Steve Jobs biography movie. Honestly, Jobs was such a complex individual that I can't see one ever being made. But, as an impressionist portrait of a specific period in his life, it's successful."" Some observers had questioned Kutcher's ability to portray such a complicated and familiar figure. But both critics had praise for the actor's performance. ""He throws himself into the role, inhabiting Jobs in his mannerisms and gestures while doing a more than creditable impression of the man's voice. Kutcher also captures Jobs' deliberate, slightly hunched-over walk,"" writes CNET's Newton. ""At moments, as during an enjoyable sequence in which Jobs recruits members for the Macintosh team, Kutcher disappears into the role."" ""jOBS"" attracted some controversy last week after a scene from the movie was posted on the Internet. In the clip, Jobs raves about the commercial potential of an operating system that Wozniak has created. ""Nobody wants to buy a computer,"" says Wozniak. Replies Jobs, ""How does somebody know what they want if they've never even seen it?"" Wozniak told Gizmodo that the scene's characterizations were inaccurate. ""We never had such interaction and roles,"" said the Apple co-founder, who has not seen the whole film. ""I'm not even sure what it's getting at ... personalities are very wrong, although mine is closer."" In response, the filmmakers behind ""jOBS"" issued a statement saying the movie ""is not a documentary, nor is it meant to be a blow by blow, word for word account of all conversations and events. ... The filmmakers acknowledge that not every single thing in the film is a precise representation of what took place, but is feature film entertainment."" Kutcher discusses playing Jobs at Sundance . Steve Jobs died in October 2011 after a long battle with cancer. ""jOBS"" is scheduled to open in theaters April 19. Meanwhile, production is under way on another film about Jobs' life, written by Aaron Sorkin (""The Social Network"") and based on Walter Isaacson's best-selling book. Wozniak is a consultant on that film.","Steve Jobs biopic premieres Friday night at the Sundance Film Festival to mixed reviews .

"(CNN) -- At least 23 people were killed and dozens wounded in a series of attacks targeting Sunni areas across northern Iraq on Thursday, police officials told CNN. The deadliest attack was in Samarra, where 16 people died when a car bomb exploded in an outdoor market Thursday evening. Another 27 were wounded in the largely Sunni city, about 100 km (63 miles) north of Baghdad, police said. In Baghdad, gunmen shot dead three men outside their house in Saydiya, a mixed Sunni-Shiite area on the city's southwest side. And in al-Adil, a Sunni neighborhood in western Baghdad, gunmen opened fire on a group of people in a residential area and killed two people, police said. In Mosul, a car bomb exploded outside a local hospital and killed two people. Nine other people were wounded in this explosion. Mosul is a largely Sunni city about 360 km (224 miles) north of Baghdad. Police officials in those cities spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not allowed to release information to media. The latest bloodshed followed the deaths of 56 people Wednesday in a series of blasts that targeted mostly Shiite areas in and around Baghdad. Another 200 were wounded. The country has endured months of escalating violence stemming from decades-old discord between the nation's Sunnis and Shiites, the two largest branches of Islam. July was the deadliest month in Iraq since the peak of sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007. According to the United Nations, 1,057 Iraqis were killed and another 2,326 were wounded in acts of terrorism and violence last month. Sunnis have felt politically marginalized under a Shiite-led government since the ouster of longtime leader Saddam Hussein in the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Meanwhile, the government is wary that the Sunni Islamists who've been involved in fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government are now targeting the government in Baghdad. Sunni-Shiites frictions have escalated since an April incident in Hawija, in northern Iraq, where Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. Sunni protests against the Iraqi government have continued since the Hawija incident.","Bombs, shootings wrack Sunni districts in northern Iraq .

"(CNN) -- A meteoroid struck the surface of the moon recently, causing an explosion that was visible on Earth without the aid of a telescope, NASA reported Friday. But don't be alarmed if you didn't see it; it only lasted about a second. ""It exploded in a flash nearly 10 times as bright as anything we've ever seen before,"" said Bill Cooke, of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. NASA astronomers have been monitoring the moon for the past eight years, looking for explosions caused by meteoroids hitting the lunar surface. It's part of a program to find new fields of space debris that could hit Earth. NASA says it sees hundreds of detectable lunar meteoroid impacts a year. Meteor lights up East Coast and social media . None however can match the size of the explosion they say they saw March 17. NASA says the meteoroid was about 40 kilograms and less than a meter wide, and it hit the moon's surface at 56,000 mph. It glowed like a 4th magnitude star, NASA says, thanks to an explosion equivalent to 5 tons of TNT. ""It jumped right out at me, it was so bright,"" said Ron Suggs of the Marshall Space Flight Center. Cooke says Earth was pelted by meteoroids at about the same time, but they hit the moon because it has no atmosphere to protect it. Opinion: Meteor shows why it's crucial to keep an eye on the sky . ""We'll be keeping an eye out for signs of a repeat performance next year when the Earth-moon system passes through the same region of space,"" Cooke said. If you're wondering how there can be an explosion on the moon, without oxygen, NASA has the answer for you. It says the flash of light comes not from any type of combustion -- as we typically think of explosions -- but rather by the glowing molten rock at the impact site.

"San Diego (CNN) -- Hannah Anderson, the California teenager whose abduction triggered a manhunt across the West, has survived ""a tremendous, horrific ordeal"" and faces a slow healing process, her father said Monday. ""I am very proud of her and I love her very much,"" Brett Anderson said. ""She is surrounded by the love of her family, friends and community."" But authorities kept the detail of that horrific ordeal close to the vest Monday, two days after the man accused of abducting Hannah and killing her mother and brother was killed by an FBI agent. The 16-year-old was found alive after a frantic, week-long search that stretched from southern California to the wilderness of central Idaho, more than 1,000 miles away, where she was found at a campsite by a mountain lake. At a news conference in San Diego, Brett Anderson thanked investigators as well as reporters and social media users who spread the story ""across and beyond"" the United States. How to help Hannah Anderson . ""Have no doubt that this did make a difference,"" he said. But he said it was time ""for us to grieve and move on to the healing process,"" and he pleaded for the ""respect and time"" needed for that to happen. Hannah's ordeal came to an end after a tip from horseback riders sent FBI agents swarming to a camping spot outside Cascade, Idaho. James DiMaggio, the man investigators had sought in her disappearance, was shot in a confrontation with an FBI tactical agent. Hannah told authorities that DiMaggio fired at least once before being shot, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said. ""Obviously we would have liked for Mr. DiMaggio to surrender and face justice in the court of law,"" Gore said. ""But that's not going to be the case."" Hannah did not appear to have significant physical injuries and was reunited with her father Sunday. She was unaware that her mother and brother were dead until after DiMaggio was killed, when she was told of their killings by FBI interviewers, Gore said. Gore would discuss no details of Hannah's abduction except to say she was under ""extreme duress"" the entire time. He said the investigation is still going on, but cautioned, ""We might never know some of these answers."" ""When you get a completely irrational act like we've seen here, with two murders and a kidnapping, sometimes you're not going to come up with a rational explanation of what happened,"" he said. Grief to euphoria: Teen rescued, suspect killed . 'Uncle Jim' and his interest in Hannah . DiMaggio's friendship with the Anderson family had been long and close, predating Hannah's birth. Hannah referred to him as ""Uncle Jim."" But there were some signs that DiMaggio was infatuated with Hannah and signs he was trying to lure the family to his home in rural San Diego County, near the Mexican border, her grandparents said. The signs were subtle, according to grandparents Ralph and Sara Britt, also of San Diego. ""He seemed to enjoy being with Hannah and her friends ... more and more,"" Ralph Britt said, shaking his head. ""But he's been with the kids for years."" ""There was no danger sign, nothing that you would act on, say it was wrong,"" he said. ""It was just friendly."" But a friend of Hannah's said she saw a different side to the relationship between DiMaggio and the teen. Marissa Chavez told CNN that she was in a car with Hannah and DiMaggio, 40, a few months ago when he told Hannah he had a crush on her. Suspect's father once held teen at gunpoint . He followed it up by saying if he was her age, he would date Hannah, Chavez said. Hannah was unnerved by the comments, but did not tell her mother because she did not want to ruin the close relationship that her parents had with DiMaggio, Chavez said. But Hannah did not want to be alone with DiMaggio after that, according to Chavez. ""I don't think she would have gone willingly with him at all,"" she said. In an earlier episode, Chavez recalled a trip that DiMaggio and Hannah took to Hollywood. The trip was supposed to be for one week, but Hannah told Chavez that they came back after two days because DiMaggio was upset that she wasn't paying enough attention to him. 'You can't really tell the book by its cover' Sara Britt said DiMaggio would have done anything for them and they would have returned the favor. ""My message is to parents: Just be more aware, more conscious of what's going on,"" Britt said. ""Life gets busy, but take the time. If anything, learn something from this and that is just to be more aware for your children."" Ralph Britt added: ""I guess you can't really tell the book by its cover,"" he said. ""It was just complete shock. We didn't have any idea. I don't know what you would look for."" In the weeks before DiMaggio's home in rural San Diego County went up in flames, he pleaded for the Andersons to visit him one last time. He had lost the home to foreclosure and said he was moving back to Texas. ""We feel it was planned at this point based on the information that's out there,"" said Sara Britt. ""It's so unfortunate. Apparently he tried to get her up there before, but she couldn't go and so ... she went, took the dog and the kids."" Hannah went missing after cheerleading practice on August 3. The next day, the bodies of her mother, Christina Anderson, 42, and 8-year-old brother, Ethan, were found about 45 miles east of San Diego, in DiMaggio's burned house in Boulevard. The body of a dog was also recovered, police said. The horror spurred an Amber Alert and a manhunt, which zeroed in the Idaho highlands after DiMaggio's blue Nissan Versa was found outside Cascade. Then there was a sighting of the pair by horseback riders, who considered them poorly equipped for the environment. 'Red flags' Mark John, one of those riders, said Sunday that they saw multiple ""red flags"" during their brief encounter, including the brand-new camping equipment they carried and the pajama-like bottoms Hannah was wearing. It was ""just like a square peg going into a round hole,"" John said. ""They didn't fit."" Another rider, Mike Young, said it looked like Hannah ""had a scared look on her face,"" adding about DiMaggio: ""I just had a gut feeling about him."" Unaware of the Amber Alert, however, the horseback riders continued on, and only after seeing a news report on the pair upon returning home did the group put the puzzle pieces together. ""When I seen that picture on the screen, I told my wife, I said, 'That is the girl that was up on that mountain,' "" John recalled. Hundreds of law enforcement agents started to scour 300 square miles of rough terrain -- dense forests, steep valleys and peaks over 8,000 feet -- hampered by the smoke from nearby wildfires. Key moments in the manhunt . Late Saturday afternoon, they spotted the pair's campsite near Morehead Lake, about 30 miles from Cascade. But the topography was so steep, helicopters had to drop authorities off far away from the camp. Hostage rescue teams had to hike more than two hours to get to the scene, local sheriffs' departments said. They moved in carefully so they wouldn't alert DiMaggio that they were coming. They moved in after DiMaggio and the girl were separated, unshering Hannah to an area where a helicopter could whisk her away. At some point, a ""confrontation"" ensued between authorities and DiMaggio, Gore said. The confrontation ended when an FBI tactical agent shot and killed the murder and kidnapping suspect.

"(CNN) -- The puppeteer who gave Sesame Street's Elmo his voice allegedly threw a crystal meth sex party for a teenage boy in 2004, according to a federal lawsuit filed this week. Sheldon Stephens, now 24, is the fourth man to sue Kevin Clash, but he was the first one to publicly claim he had a sexual relationship with him as a teen. Stephens' lawsuit is ""meritless and barred by the statute of limitations,"" Clash lawyer Michael Berger told CNN Tuesday. ""Mr. Clash continues to deny any wrongdoing, and we intend to defend this case forcefully."" Although Stephens called it an ""an adult consensual relationship"" last November, the revelation triggered Clash's suspension from Sesame Street and eventually his resignation. Clash, who provided the high-pitched voice of the iconic furry red Elmo since 1984, acknowledged a relationship between ""two consenting adults"" when Stephens' story first emerged, but he said it otherwise was a ""false and defamatory allegation."" ""I am a gay man,"" Clash, 52, said in a statement in November. ""I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it, but felt it was a personal and private matter."" When heroes disappoint our kids . Three other men soon emerged with federal lawsuits, filed last November and December, accusing Clash of befriending them as teenager then engaging in sex with them. They are all represented by Florida lawyer Jeff Herman, who also filed Stephens' lawsuit Monday. Clash's lawyer has asked a judge to dismiss the three other suits based on his argument that the men waited too long to sue. The federal statute of limitations on such civil cases is six years, while their allegations involve relationships that ended more than 10 years ago, Berger said in a court filing this month. Each lawsuit contends that the men only realized in the last year or so that they suffered psychological and emotional damage from their encounters with Clash. ""Clash was an adult male living a prominent public life centered around the entertainment of toddlers, while at the same time he was, in secret, preying on teenage boys to satisfy his depraved sexual interests,"" the Stephens suit alleged. While the allegations in the newest suit mirror what the other men contend, Stephens' complaint is the only one to allege drug use by Clash. ""Clash smoked crystal meth while engaging in sexual activity with Sheldon,"" the lawsuit said. ""Clash also gave Sheldon 'poppers' as a sexual aide. While Clash had sexual contact with Sheldon, the chauffeur watched and masturbated."" ""Poppers"" generally refers to alkyl nitrites in capsule form that produce a physical rush when broken and inhaled: crystal meth refers to crystal methamphetamine. Stephens was 16 when he met Clash in New York ""at a social networking event for models and actors,"" the suit said. ""Clash told Sheldon he would help Sheldon with his acting career,"" it said. Clash resigned from his job on ""Sesame Street"" after the first lawsuit was filed in November. ""I am resigning from Sesame Workshop with a very heavy heart,"" Clash said in a written statement at the time. ""I have loved every day of my 28 years working for this exceptional organization. Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work Sesame Street is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer. I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately."" Despite his stepping down, Clash's voice will be used for Elmo through 2014, as the next season of ""Sesame Street"" has already been filmed.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Tired of the same old engagement and wedding photos? The cliched poses in gardens or on beaches? Then take some inspiration from the creative couples in Hong Kong, who are memorializing their love with unconventional photo shoots featuring such surreal backdrops as giant cats or pastries. Many couples in the city opt to take engagement photos months before the big day, a tradition that started in Taiwan and has now spread to China and South Korea. The more adventurous are opting for photo shoots that diverge from the standard scenes, and instead reflect something about their personalities, passions or the story of their love.

Kim Lee wanted a theme that reflected her love of food, so her photos with her fianc√É¬© Daniel Chan feature the couple sitting on giant egg tarts and macaroons. Yvonne Ho, the wedding planner behind Lee and Chan's shoot, said planning this sort of photography is closer to an advertising or fashion shoot. Ho works to create an individualized concept for each couple, so they come away feeling she has presented the story of their life together. ""I want to share their love,"" she said, adding that her responsibility is to ""tell the story by the photos."" In the case of sporting enthusiasts Kenny Tang and Olivia Kok, Ho enlisted a professional underwater photographer to capture the couple's active lifestyle. Tang and Kok jumped into a swimming pool fully clothed and relied on scuba tanks to breathe underwater. Read more: Underwater weddings in Thailand . The average couple in Hong Kong spends $2700 (HK$20,969) on engagement photos, according to e-commerce website ESDlife. That is twice the amount they're willing to spend on a photographer for their wedding. The unusual engagement photos are typically printed into albums and turned into slideshows that are displayed on their wedding day. Read more: Fairytale Indian wedding photography . For Wancy Wong, she couldn't bear the thought of leaving her 19-year-old pet cat out of her engagement photos. She worked with Ho to plan a series of poses that featured her fianc√É¬©, Frankie Cheung and her cat, Ah B. When the cat died just before the planned photo shoot, Wong was heartbroken and shelved the idea. But after a few months, Ho encouraged Wong to revisit the concept and turn her wedding photos into a tribute. With a little help from Photoshop, Ho superimposed images of the couple onto old photos of Ah B. ""I'm very happy with the result,"" Wong said.

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Five people were shot Friday outside a Chicago, Illinois, high school, police said. Police say a shooting outside a Chicago high school on Friday may be gang-related. Authorities said the shooting occurred about 8 p.m. CT outside Dunbar High School on Chicago's South Side. ""It appears to be gang-related,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Jody Weis said at a news conference, adding that more than 200 officers were investigating the incident. ""We anticipate solving this thing in the not too distant future,"" Weis said. Chicago Fire Department spokeswoman Eve Rodriguez said the five people -- all males -- were wounded by gunfire and taken to area hospitals. Two were in serious condition, one was in critical condition and two were in stable condition, she said. Rodriguez also said a female victim was injured in a fall and was listed in good condition at a hospital. Rodriguez told CNN affiliate WGN that all of the victims were ""young people,"" but she could not say whether they were students. WGN reported that a basketball game was in double overtime at the school when shots were fired outside the building. Basketball games had been underway at the school for about four hours, and some students were leaving the building when gunfire broke out, WGN reported. Shaneisha Turman, 15, told WGN that she was standing in the doorway of the gym when she saw a silver truck pull up to a nearby bus stop. The occupants of the truck pretended to shoot, Turman said, and then ""they really started shooting."" People were shouting ""They're shooting,"" Turman said, adding, ""It was a lot of people shouting and running.""

"Middletown, Connecticut (CNN) -- Five people were killed and at least 12 were injured in a gas explosion Sunday at an under-construction power plant in central Connecticut, local officials said. Residents up to 20 miles away reported hearing the blast at about 11:19 a.m. at the Kleen Power Plant in Middletown, a suburb of Hartford, Connecticut. ""There is no present or continuing threat to anybody from either substances getting into the atmosphere or of a possible subsequent explosion,"" Middletown Mayor Sebastian Giuliano said, adding terrorism has been ruled out. He said plant workers were purging a natural gas pipeline when the explosion occurred. ""Urban search-and-rescue teams are on the premises ... with dogs, attempting to locate and account for further victims,"" Giuliano said. It's unknown how many people were working in the plant, which was about 95 percent complete, at the time of the explosion. Multiple contractors were involved in the project, Giuliano said, complicating efforts to account for those who may have been on the site. ""[Each contractor] has their own foreperson, their own employee list, so we're trying to sort that out,"" Giuliano said. Deputy Fire Marshal Al Santostefano said later Sunday that no one has come forward with any names of missing people and dogs have not detected signs of life beneath the rubble left by the explosion. The plant was expected to go online this summer, Giuliano said. Santostefano initially said about 50 people, most of them construction workers, were working at the time, but Giuliano said ""we don't know that as a hard number right now."" ""What I've been told by the owners of the project is that there could be anywhere from 100 to 200 people working on the site on any given day,"" Giuliano said. But Santostefano later said the numbers Giuliano cited were weekday figures, and he repeated his estimate of 50 to 60 people at the site Sunday when the explosion occurred. He said he thought most of those escaped the blast. A no-fly zone was established over the site because of the unstable structure, Gov. Jodi Rell announced Sunday night. Middlesex Hospital in Middletown said it received 11 patients from the explosion. One patient with serious injuries was flown to a hospital in Hartford, and another was transferred to Yale New Haven Hospital, according to a statement on Middlesex's Web site. Two others had minor injuries and were treated and released. The remaining seven patients sustained injuries ""mainly to the extremities, including broken bones, blunt trauma and abdominal pains,"" the statement said. Emergency room physician Dr. Jonathan Bankoff told reporters that some patients reported being thrown 30 or 40 feet by the blast. Two people were airlifted directly to the Hartford hospital from the scene,  Middlesex spokesman R. Brian Albert said. A center was being set up at Middletown's City Hall for relatives of plant workers, he said. As of late Sunday afternoon, the hospital said it was not expecting more patients from the plant. After the explosion, it took a while for emergency crews to get into the plant, Santostefano said, because the plant was on fire and the natural gas had to be turned off at the source. No major incidents at the site had been reported since construction began there a couple of years ago, he said. People miles away reported hearing or feeling the blast. ""It felt like the house was shaking,"" Peter Moore, who lives about 10 miles away in Durham, told CNN. He said he thought at first there had been a traffic accident on his street or there was a problem with his house. Moore said his mother, who lives in Woodbridge, about 20 miles away from the plant, also said she heard the explosion, and said it ""sounded like someone pounded on the back door a couple of times."" ""It was almost like an earthquake,"" nearby resident Lynn Townsend told CNN affiliate WTNH. She said she heard the explosion and went outside to see ""a very big, bright orange flame"" between the plant's two smokestacks, and immediately dialed 911. ""It really shook the house,"" she said. ""Everybody was scared. The kids started to cry."" WTNH.com coverage of Middletown explosion . Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance told WTNH his agency has received ""an immense amount of inquiries"" from residents who heard or felt the explosion.

"(CNN) -- A roller coaster at Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio has been temporarily closed as a precautionary measure after a woman died last week on a similar ride at Six Flags over Texas in Arlington. No injuries have been reported on the Iron Rattler in San Antonio, which opened in May, but it will remain closed while officials investigate the Six Flags death in Arlington. Meanwhile, an inquest by the Tarrant County medical examiner's office revealed details Tuesday on how Rosy Esparza died after being ejected from her third-row seat as the Texas Giant roller coaster began a steep descent on the first large hill. On Friday, Esparza fell about 75 feet, struck a metal beam and came to rest on the metal roof of a tunnel, the inquest found. Esparza, 52, of Dallas died of multiple traumatic injuries and had extensive trauma to her torso, the medical examiner said. Esparza, who is identified in the report by her maiden name of Rosa Irene Ayala-Gaona, was pronounced dead at the scene. After deadly roller coaster ride, more questions than answers . The manner of her death is pending further investigation and laboratory results, the medical examiner's office said. At its highest point, the Texas Giant is 153 feet and has a drop of 147 feet, according to the theme park. The Texas Giant was originally designed in 1990 as an all wooden roller coaster. It was redesigned with a steel track and reopened in April 2011 to mark the theme park's 50th anniversary. Esparza's son-in-law and his wife were sitting in front of her at the time. Contrary to witness accounts reported by CNN affiliates, Ronald Segovia told CNN he did not hear his mother-in-law mention that her seat did not lock properly. Police: No fould play seen in Texas roller coaster death . Segovia also told CNN that Esparza was sitting by herself, contrary to initial reports she was sitting beside her son. Her sons, according to Segovia, were not there. In Facebook posts Saturday, her sons described the experience as horrific. On Saturday, authorities said an initial investigation showed no sign of foul play in the woman's death. ""At this point of the investigation, it does not appear there was any foul play or criminality associated with this tragic incident,"" the Arlington Police Department said in a statement. Six Flags Over Texas spokeswoman Sharon Parker said the park is committed to determining what happened.

"(CNN) -- When I started the Fit Nation program, I was a big guy. Seven months later, I'm still a big guy. I've run endless miles, biked endless hills, swum endless laps. Is there less of me? Yes. Am I fitter? Yes. Am I healthier? Absolutely. But am I finished? NO WAY! There has been quite a debate raging in recent years about whether you can be ""fat and fit."" There's no easy answer to that question. Perhaps the answer changes from person to person as our goals change. Over the years, everyone in the Fit Nation family has achieved great success, but in many cases, the pounds don't always dramatically disappear. We've all gained strength and improved our cardiovascular health, but I never thought of this as a weight-loss program. At least for me, the real changes have been in my body composition (more muscle and less fat), my overall endurance and my mental toughness. I've learned that being healthy is ultimately about being honest with myself. It's about being honest about what I can accomplish and what I can expect to accomplish in the short- and long-term. I think I would be doing myself and my health a disservice if I accepted the premise that I could be fat and fit, or at least as fit as I want to and can be. While I'm healthier now that I was at the beginning of the year, I still have improvements to make and fitness to gain. I hope to continue making gains for the rest of my life. Good health: The best birthday present . We all joined this program for different reasons, but the one thing that united us is that we wanted to take steps toward better health through a more active lifestyle, for ourselves and for the people we love. The one thing that Fit Nation has taught me is that I now know where I want to go, and I feel like I'm better prepared mentally and physically to get there. Getting what you want doesn't always come easily. I am about to achieve my short-term goal of finishing the Nautica Malibu Triathlon. I didn't expect to cross the finish line as an elite racer, but I did expect to become healthier person. Mission accomplished. Setting goals is really pretty simple, when you think about it.

"(CNN) -- A man lost both of his hands and four other people were injured in an explosion Friday morning at a southern Boston apartment building, Boston police said. Police spokeswoman Neva Coakley said the nature of the explosion at the building in the Hyde Park neighborhood wasn't immediately clear. However, Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis told The Boston Globe that the man who lost his hands had been mixing chemicals in his basement apartment, and that the chemicals exploded. Two people, including the man who lost his hands, were taken to a hospital, and three others were treated at the site in the Hyde Park neighborhood for unspecified injuries, Boston police said. Davis said the man mixing the chemicals might have been experimenting with fireworks, and investigators didn't immediately know why the chemicals exploded, according to the Globe. The incident had ""no connection to terrorism,"" Davis told CNN affiliate WCVB. ""He told us he was experimenting,"" Davis said, according to the station.

"(CNN) -- So, a judge walks out of a bar ... When the New Jersey Supreme Court decided that Vincent August Sicari must choose between his career as a municipal judge and his other career in the entertainment industry, he decided it wasn't yet the time to have a last laugh. Vincent August Sicari has practiced both law and comedy for over 15 years, and in January 2008 he became a part-time municipal judge in South Hackensack. While a judge, he continued to pursue his entertainment career as a standup comedian and actor, including appearing on the TV show ""What Would You Do?"" under the name Vince August, according to court documents. Sicari resigned in person from his judiciary position Thursday, just a few hours after the high court issued its unanimous decision. ""I'm disappointed. I'm proud of being a judge; I take great pride in it. It is a great life accomplishment, a great career accomplishment,"" Sicari told CNN Thursday. ""I don't like being forced to make a decision."" Though no longer a judge, Sicari will continue to be an attorney -- which is permitted -- and moonlight as an actor and comedian. He says that over the years he made the decision specifically not to work for big law firms so he could designate his hours as he saw fit and not neglect one career over the other. ""I'm going to keep doing what I was doing, but now I'm not a judge,"" Sicari said. According to court documents, Sicari provided information about his standup routines to the Advisory Committee on Extrajudicial Activities following his municipal court appointment. After the panel determined that his comedy career was a conflict, he appealed to the state's high court. Sicari argued that his two careers were completely independent of one another and never overlapped, according to statements put forward in court. The Supreme Court judges pointed, however, to a writeup in the Bergen Record newspaper in which they associated Vince A. Sicari, the lawyer, and Vince August, the actor and comedian. ""Vince Sicari, the lawyer, may be free to pursue a parallel career as an actor and comedian. Once he chose also to serve as a municipal court judge, however, he became subject to the Code of Judicial Conduct,"" the judges wrote. One canon of the Code of Judicial Conduct requires judges ""to conduct any extrajudicial activities in a manner to avoid casting reasonable doubt on the judge's capacity to act impartially as a judge."" Sicari could be seen in various roles on ""What Would You Do?"" -- a show that features social experiments to capture public's reactions to real-life scenarios played out by actors. The judges noted that his roles portraying homophobia, racial profiling and other forms of discrimination could be misleading to someone catching a glimpse of the show before changing the channel. His routines at comedy clubs often involve politics and religion. ""In the course of his routines, Sicari has demeaned certain people based on national origin and religion and has revealed his political leanings,"" the judges wrote. ""The court cannot ignore the distinct possibility that a person who has heard a routine founded on humor disparaging certain ethnic groups and religions will not be able to readily accept that the judge before whom he or she appears can maintain the objectivity and impartiality that must govern all municipal court proceedings."" Sicari maintains that his careers that he loves equally, were always separate. ""When I'm a lawyer I'm focused on that, when I'm on stage, on set, I focus on that,"" he told CNN. ""I thought I've done it pretty well.""","Vincent August Sicari held down two careers -- one as a comedian, the other as a judge .

"Sao Paulo (CNN) -- Antonio Patriota, Brazil's foreign minister, stepped down Monday night amid a diplomatic row with neighboring Bolivia. President Dilma Rousseff's office issued a brief statement, saying Patriota had submitted his resignation and would be replaced by Brazil's representative at the United Nations, Luiz Alberto Figueiredo. The resignation comes a day after a Brazilian diplomat helped an opposition senator from Bolivia flee into Brazil. The senator, Roger Pinto, had been living in the Brazilian embassy in La Paz for more than a year after seeking asylum there. Pinto said he was targeted by Bolivian officials after accusing members of Bolivian President Evo Morales' government of drug trafficking and corruption. Over the weekend, Brazilian diplomat Eduardo Saboia helped Pinto flee to the border during a 20-hour drive in a diplomatic car. That action sparked outrage from the Bolivian government. In a television interview, Saboia said he had acted without consulting with the Foreign Ministry.

Now, the alleged assailants are facing the consequences. Three teenagers appeared in a juvenile court Tuesday in Gulfport, Florida. They were charged with aggravated battery. If they had been in adult court, the charges would have constituted a second-degree felony, Judge Raymond Gross said.

"(CNN) -- A bomb scare that forced the evacuation of Jacksonville International Airport was a hoax, officials said Wednesday. A suspect was arrested after the incident Tuesday. Zeljko Causevic, 39, is charged with one count of making a false report about planting a bomb, and one count of manufacturing, possessing, selling or delivering a ""hoax bomb,"" according to Jacksonville Aviation Authority spokesman Michael Stewart. He was arrested at the airport. See photo of arrest at airport . There was no immediate public statement by an attorney on Causevic's behalf. The FBI is assisting in the probe. During the bomb scare, a bag was searched and X-rayed. No explosive device was found, a federal law enforcement source told CNN. After the airport was evacuated, some arriving flights were diverted and some passengers who were on planes that had already landed were taken to hotels. Hours later, officials issued an all-clear. Passengers wait after being evacuated . ""We erred on the side of caution in terms of doing whatever's necessary to make sure that everybody is safe,"" Stewart said. Shannon Harley, with the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, said Tuesday a device was found and rendered safe. He did not describe it as an explosive. Reports of the event first surfaced on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- It's an annual spectacle of diplomacy, dialogue and debate: the U.N. General Assembly session. International leaders shake hands, sip tea, catch up. Sometimes resolutions are passed; many times they aren't. This week, almost 200 countries will step up to the global stage again to tell the world what they want. Here are five things to look for during the session that begins Tuesday in New York: . 1. The Syria conundrum . It's been a hot topic for two years, yet not much has been accomplished. But there's a new sense of urgency to reach a deal on Syria, now with the confirmed use of chemical weapons and the threat of Western force hanging over diplomats' heads. In an ideal world, the U.N. Security Council would agree on what to do about Syria, where more than 100,000 people have died in the two-year-long civil war. But the Syria conundrum is like a boxing match with unlimited rounds. In one corner, countries like the United States and France want Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down. At the very least, they want to be able to use force if the regime doesn't give up all its chemical weapons. In the other corner, Russia and China won't stand for any strong action against their ally. The clock is ticking. Syria has agreed to a Russian-U.S. timeline for the removal of its chemical weapons, but the plan has to be sanctioned as a U.N. resolution. And since the two sides can't agree on whether to include the threat of force in the resolution, we'll see if the sparring countries can hammer out a deal before time runs out -- or before more bodies pile up. 2. The Iran overture . It's become as predictable as General Assembly's meeting itself: Iran's president take the mic, and diplomats walk out of the room in protest. But this year, the Holocaust-denying, West-baiting Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is gone. In his place is Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, who has said he wants to mend fences. ""We must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart,"" Rouhani wrote in The Washington Post last week. U.S. officials are skeptical about the outreach. They want Iran to walk the walk -- not just talk the talk -- on halting nuclear enrichment. But Iran's charm offensive, apparently spurred by tough economic sanctions, has spurred speculation that Rouhani and U.S. President Barack Obama will meet at the General Assembly. If they do, it'll be the first meeting between American and Iranian presidents since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. There's no such meeting on the schedule. But the White House says it hasn't ruled one out, either. No Iran meeting yet, but Obama's U.N. visit will center on Middle East region . Rouhani will address the General Assembly on Tuesday. Diplomatic corridors are abuzz with speculation that he'll make a dramatic announcement, perhaps offering to close an nuclear enrichment plant or allow inspectors in. We doubt anyone will be walking out. 3. The Mideast dilemma . Will Palestinians get a step closer this year to becoming a recognized member state? Last year, Palestinians won recognition from the U.N. General Assembly as a non-member state. The upgraded diplomatic status gave them access to U.N. bodies. It also raised concerns in Israel that Palestinians would seek membership in agencies such as the International Criminal Court, where it can press for war crimes charges against Israel. This year's agenda will include talks on the ""permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and of the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan over their natural resources."" Obama will meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, the first time the two have met since direct Mideast peace negotiations restarted earlier this year. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to visit the White House at the end of the month. 4. The LatAm tension . Things could get awkward when U.S. diplomats run into some of their Latin American counterparts. Brazil had a falling out with Washington over reports that the U.S. was electronically spying on the its president's communications. Both countries agreed to postpone Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's state visit to Washington in October to a later date. Venezuela isn't exactly happy with the United States, either. Last week, the government accused the U.S. of refusing to allow its president's plane to fly through U.S. airspace while en route to China. The State Department denied the claim, saying it granted permission for the plane to fly over Puerto Rico. 5. The no-show ... and the not wanted . Not all the 193 countries will be represented in New York. Kenya recalled its envoy, Macharia Kamau, because Deputy President William Ruto has been on trial at the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity. ""We very much regret that he cannot be out of the country at the same time as the Deputy President,"" Kenyan State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said in a statement. The U.N. court accuses Ruto of plotting attacks that killed more than 1,000 people after Kenya's disputed presidential election almost six years ago. He denies it. Another leader the International Criminal Court would like to get its hands on is Sudan's president. He's wanted for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged role in a five-year campaign of violence in Darfur. But President Omar al-Bashir might show up anyway. ""As I've said numerous times, he has submitted a visa application. We're not going to sort through the considerations underway right now on that application publicly,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Friday. There's little the U.S. can do. As the host country, it's generally obligated to grant visas to heads of state, wanted or not. CNN's Elise Labott, Kevin Liptak, Faith Karimi, Laura Smith-Spark and Tim Lister contributed to this report.","The global debate over Syria is expected to be a hot topic .

"(CNN) -- Sunday night brought the beginning of the end for Walter White of ""Breaking Bad."" The first of the final eight episodes featured an unbelievably tense scene, one that left fans with two words of wisdom as they barrel toward the conclusion. They were uttered by Bryan Cranston's corrupt meth kingpin after his brother-in-law, DEA agent Hank, tells him he doesn't even know who Walt is anymore. Walt's advice? In that case, ""tread lightly."" (Mindy Kaling's advice on Twitter wasn't half-bad either: ""If you didn't see breaking bad tonight, tomorrow you better take your spoilers like a man."") Keeping that in mind, we'll tread lightly on revealing too much in case you're still catching up or somehow nodded off during the mid-season premiere. The expectations were intimidatingly high for Sunday's ""Blood Money,"" but in the eyes of critics, creator Vince Gilligan and his team delivered -- as did stars Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. The journey kicks off with another flash-forward, showing the White home in disarray, its pool drained of its contents with a yellow ""Heisenberg"" tagged on a wall. We watched Walt grab the ricin capsule from behind an electrical socket, and then we're back in the present again. And that's when the real fun begins. We knew that Hank suspected that Walt was the meth kingpin he's been chasing, but we didn't know how he'd put those pieces together. Sunday's episode wasted no time answering one of our big questions, and by the end of it, Hank and Walt were stunningly face-to-face. It was at this point that we sort of wished AMC would go the Netflix route and just give the episodes to us all at once, and we're not the only ones. ""This TV version of a literary thriller has reached the point where the pieces are finally coming together and all we want to do is whip through its pages and finally devour that much-craved resolution. But we can't, because there are seven more episodes to go,"" said Salon's Jen Chaney. ""There's a lesson in it ... After watching a show about a man who comes to think he can have everything his way, whenever he wants, it's good to be reminded that most people can't. We are not in control, so we must accept it, respect it and patiently savor the prolonged, delicious agony."" The New Yorker found the climactic scene to be ""a classic opener for the season: a cowboy showdown that placed Hank, once a minor, comic character on the show, dead center in the role of hero."" And yet, the magazine's Emily Nussbaum predicts, ""Based on that terrifying cold open, it's a solid bet that Hero Hank is a red herring, and the show's real endgame will be Jesse, the one most damaged by Walt."" Esquire's Alex Berenson agrees, believing that there's no way Walt is making it out of this series alive -- flash-forwards to his 52nd birthday with a head full of hair, be damned -- and that Jesse is going to be the one to do it. ""Like all good psychopaths, Walter has convinced himself that his prior crimes don't matter as long as he lives decently in the future,"" Berenson writes. ""But Jesse can't forget what they've done. Jesse has grown a conscience, and it's killing him. And if Jesse is to find any kind of peace for the rest of his life -- even in prison -- he's going to have to destroy the monster he knows better than anyone else."" With just seven more episodes to go, we'll find out soon enough. Judging from the premiere, though, the rest of the season is bound to be just as fantastic as whatever end we find. As Time magazine's James Poniewozik put it, ""Game freakin' on.""","""Breaking Bad"" returned for its final eight episodes on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- It's no secret that Bolivian President Evo Morales is not a fan of the U.S. government, and at the U.N. General Assembly he took his complaints to a wider audience, calling for action against the Obama administration. ""I want to propose ... that we think seriously about constituting a 'Tribunal of the People' with international bodies and the large defenders of human rights to begin a lawsuit against the Obama government,"" he said on Tuesday. Earlier this month, the Bolivian president said his country would accuse the United States of crimes against humanity in the international courts. His statements might be written off as bluster, but it nonetheless was a strong critique of the United States on an important stage. In a way, Morales is continuing a tradition of bombastic barbs before the United Nations by a number of Latin American countries with leftist governments. It was at the same podium that the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, in 2006, called George W. Bush the devil and that behind the microphone ""it smells of sulfur still."" Chavez's message seven years ago was that Bush acted ""as if he owned the world."" Morales has a similar complaint, targeting Obama. The United States practices ""aerial piracy"" by denying use of its airspace or limiting the number of visas it grants to delegations from countries it doesn't like, Morales told CNN en Espa√É¬±ol Thursday. ""Sometimes, they limit our visas,"" Morales said. ""They blackmail us with visas."" The United States will deny use of its airspace to some, and then lie about it, Morales said, referring to allegations by the Venezuelan government that its president, Nicolas Maduro, was blocked from flying over U.S. airspace last week. The Venezuelan president saw the incident as an affront, but U.S. officials said the issue was resolved satisfactorily. To Morales, Obama's government talks about democracy but acts like a hegemon, asserting dominance around the world. ""First, he talks about peace, we know he is a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, but he does not contribute to peace,"" Morales said. Earlier the week, when Obama addressed the assembly, his focus was on Iran and the Middle East and far from Latin America. He did touch, however, on the criticisms lobbied against the U.S. for intervening in other countries' affairs, especially in the Middle East. ""The United States is chastised for meddling in the region, and accused of having a hand in all manner of conspiracy,"" he said. ""At the same time, the United States is blamed for failing to do enough to solve the region's problems, and for showing indifference toward suffering Muslim populations."" Morales attended the U.N. meeting in New York, but Maduro did not, alleging that there were plots against him. Because Maduro and other presidents do not feel safe meeting in New York, Morales suggested that the U.N. General Assembly rotate to other countries. He suggested Switzerland or Brazil.","Bolivia's Evo Morales wants to create a new court to sue the U.S.

"(CNN) -- One of two motorcyclists who police say used their helmets to bash in an SUV window moments before the driver was dragged out and allegedly assaulted by a gang of bikers turned himself in to authorities on Tuesday. The terrifying incident involving bikers on Manhattan's west side went viral after a video of the incident surfaced online. A helmet camera one of the bikers was wearing captured much of the road-rage incident, including the moment when the biker who, police say, has now turned himself in walks up to the SUV and smashes its window with a bike helmet. The man's name was not released, and police said Tuesday afternoon that he had not yet been charged. The New York City Police Department said a man driving a Range Rover with his wife and 2-year-old daughter inside Sunday struck a motorcyclist on Manhattan's West Side Highway, breaking his leg. The biker who was struck by the SUV, 28-year-old Christopher Cruz, was later arrested and faces several charges, including reckless endangerment, reckless driving and endangering the welfare of a child, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said on Tuesday. Earlier an NYPD spokeswoman, Lt. Karen Anderson, described the original incident by saying, ""It was an accident."" The SUV driver pulled over after the biker was hit, and the motorcyclists surrounded his vehicle, hitting it and spiking the tires, police said. The driver pulled away, hitting three more bikers in the process, police said. One of those bikers, Edwin Mieses, 32, is now paralyzed and in a coma, his family told CNN affiliate WBZ. ""All of his ribs are fractured,"" Mieses' mother, Yolanda Santiago, told CNN WBZ, ""his lungs are so badly bruised that he's still on a ventilator."" Mieses' wife, Dayana, told CNN affiliate WCBS her husband got off his bike to help Cruz but the SUV driver drove off, hitting her husband on the way. The hospital where Mieses is being treated did not respond to CNN inquiries about his condition. The gang, called ""Hollywood Stuntz,"" according to police, chased the man, and he was forced to stop because of flat tires. The SUV driver was cornered and beaten, according to police. He was later treated at a local hospital for slashes to his face and released. His wife and child were not injured. ""I don't condone the violence, there's no need for it,"" Mieses' sister Margie Mejia told WBZ, but ""I'm glad they chased him down and they stopped him."" Authorities have not identified the people in the SUV. Police say this same group of bikers descended on New York City and clogged up Times Square last year in what Commissioner Kelly said was a ""major stunt event."" Authorities say they were able to prevent the group from entering Times Square this year. Police arrested 15 bikers in total Sunday, seized 55 bikes and wrote 68 summons for various violations. They are looking at video footage to try to determine if any other charges will be filed in the road-rage incident. On whether it was legal for the SUV driver to leave the scene after hitting the first motorcyclist, Kelly said Tuesday that ""you have to look at the totality of the circumstances and that's what we're doing."" ""The investigation is ongoing,"" Kelly said. At this time, the SUV driver is not facing any charges. ""It's not going to bring my son's legs back, because it's not going to make him walk again,"" Mieses' mother said, ""But justice has to be served.""

"(CNN) -- Senior Iranian lawmakers are considering a boycott of Samsung, the South Korean electronics and appliance manufacturer, because of a controversial Israeli ad that pokes fun at the nuclear crisis, state-run Press TV of Iran said Friday. Samsung, meanwhile, said it had nothing to do with the commercial. The spot plays off the widely held belief that Israel is behind a series of recent explosions and assassinations connected with Iran's nuclear program. It shows actors from the popular Israeli comedy series ""AsFur,"" dressed as Iranian women and sporting facial hair, meeting up with an agent from Mossad, Israel's version of the CIA. The women discuss a Samsung tablet with the bored Mossad agent and, by hitting an application on the tablet, accidentally blow up a neighboring nuclear facility. The television spot was produced by HOT, an Israeli cable company that was offering the Samsung product free with a subscription. One version of the ad, on HOT's website, does not feature the name Samsung on the digital tablet. A video posted on YouTube, however, does include the logo. ""Samsung Electronics is aware of a recent news report in Iranian media regarding an advertisement aired by HOT cable network of Israel,"" Samsung said in a statement. ""This advertisement was produced by HOT cable network without Samsung's knowledge or participation."" A spokeswoman for HOT declined to comment. Iranian leaders were not amused. Press TV said the commercial ""implies that Israel is powerful enough to easily destroy Iran's nuclear facilities or assassinate the country's nuclear scientists."" The head of Majlis Energy Committee, Arsalan Fat'hipour, could declare a ""double-urgency"" campaign and impose a ""complete ban on buying all Samsung products,"" according to Press TV. Iran and Israel have been engaging in an increasingly heated war of words about the possibility of Israel striking Iranian nuclear facilities. At a security conference Thursday, Israel's defense minister again talked about a potential strike. ""Dealing with a nuclear Iran will be far more complex, far more dangerous and far more expensive in blood and money than stopping it today,"" he said. ""In other words, those who say in English 'later' may find later is too late."" At Friday prayers in Tehran, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, hit back. ""The Zionist regime is really the cancerous tumor of this region and needs to be removed and will be removed,"" he said to applause.

"(CNN) -- Some long-time Cuba watchers expressed skepticism Tuesday over a report by a former Mexican foreign minister that Communist leader Raul Castro removed two top-ranking officials earlier this month because they were plotting to overthrow him with the support of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Fidel Castro, beset by illness, ceded power to his younger brother, Raul, pictured, last year. Jorge G. Castaneda, who served as Mexico's foreign minister from 2000 - 2003, wrote in the March 23 issue of Newsweek, which became public Saturday, that Deputy Prime Minister Carlos Lage Davila and Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque were concerned that Raul Castro would make concessions that would betray the 50-year-old Cuban Revolution. ""For at least a month or so, Lage, Perez Roque and others were apparently involved in a conspiracy, betrayal, coup or whatever term one prefers, to overthrow or displace Raul from his position,"" Castaneda wrote. ""In this endeavor, they recruited -- or were recruited by -- Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, who in turn tried to enlist the support of other Latin American leaders, starting with Leonel Fernandez of the Dominican Republic, who refused to get involved."" The Venezuelan Embassy in Washington did not answer a verbal and written request for comment. The Dominican Republic Embassy in Washington did not answer telephones calls at various numbers. Robert Pastor, who served as a Latin America National Security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s, returned Saturday from a weeklong visit to Cuba. Pastor said he wrote Castaneda a letter upon his return expressing his disbelief in Castaneda's contentions. ""This is Jorge at his most creative,"" Pastor said Tuesday. Louis A. Perez Jr., a Cuba scholar who has written 12 books on the nation, also expressed his doubts. ""Where is this coming from?"" Perez asked. ""I operate with the idea that there has to be some standard of plausibility. Is there discontent in Cuba and was Lage seen as the heir apparent? Yeah, that's the conventional wisdom since last year. But that there's a conspiracy between Lage and Perez Roque? I don't think so. It would be helpful if the people who write these reports cross the barrier of speculation."" Castaneda freely offers that he has no proof, calling his thesis ""informed speculation."" ""I have no way to substantiate any of this,"" he said by telephone Tuesday from Mexico City. ""I have no evidence of it."" Instead, Castaneda points to an ""enigmatic"" comment former leader Fidel Castro made in a column after the two men were removed. ""He resorted to a baseball metaphor on the occasion of the World Baseball Classic to praise Dominicans for not participating (the team's plans had been unclear) and to claim that Chavez's baseball players, 'as good and young' as they might be, were no match for 'Cuba's seasoned all-stars,' "" Castaneda wrote in the Newsweek article. Castaneda says Castro was thanking Dominican President Fernandez and sending a veiled message to Chavez. The former Mexican official also points to Chavez' silence on the removal of the two men as further proof that he was involved. The two fired functionaries were acting out of loyalty to the revolution, Castaneda wrote. Fidel Castro, beset by illness, ceded power to his younger brother last year. Most analysts see Fidel Castro as the more idealistic and doctrinaire of the two brothers, while Raul is viewed as more pragmatic. ""Their reasons for wishing to unseat Raul were mainly turf and power,"" Castaneda wrote, ""but they also feared that the leader was beginning to feel threatened by the reaction of the Cuban people to excessive economic and social deprivation, and after his brother's demise would be unable to control the flow of events. Consequently, he would accept a series of economic and political reforms to normalize relations with the United States. ... ""They believed this to be a betrayal of the revolution, and the beginning of the end of its survival."" According to Castaneda, Raul Castro detected the plot and went to his brother and gave him an ultimatum: support him or the plotters. Fidel Castro agreed to back his brother, Castaneda wrote. The Castro brothers then called in Chavez and gave him a ""devil's alternative: back off, while maintaining economic support for the island, or lose his Cuban security detail and intelligence apparatus, exposing himself to coups and assassination attempts from eventual Venezuelan replacements. He chose to stick with the Castros."" Castaneda acknowledges that Pastor and others have criticized him but says, ""I ask that they offer a better explanation."" Says Pastor, ""Most of them are quite conventional explanations. Everyone knew he was going to change the Cabinet. The only question was when the changes would be."" Raul Castro was merely trying to make the government more efficient, Pastor said. ""What was he doing?"" he asked. ""Merging different ministries, trying to decentralize and strengthen the government's capacity to undertake economic reforms."" But Castaneda points to the manner in which the two men were removed as proof that there was more to it than just a change in government. Why weren't Lage and Perez Roque given ambassadorships or other face-saving posts, as is often done in cases like this, he asked? Instead, Castaneda said, the men were stripped of all posts and made to sign letters in which they confessed to unspecified ""mistakes."" And one day after the two men were removed, Fidel Castro wrote in his column that they were ousted after they became seduced by the ""honey of power,"" which led them to an ""unworthy role."" Castro further said the two men had reawakened the illusions of ""foreign powers"" regarding Cuba's future. Castaneda says Raul Castro was worried about what would happen after Fidel dies and was trying to avert a succession battle. Perez Roque, 43, might have been perceived as a threat. ""Perez Roque was popular in Cuba; his youth, his humble origins, his combative nature all brought him closer to the people than most Cuban bureaucrats,"" Castaneda wrote in Newsweek. Pastor notes that the decision to remove the two men was not popular. ""There was pushback in Cuba among the [Communist Party] cadres and the public who said, ""We've connected with these two people. Why are they going?"" Pastor said. ""They didn't feel the government had given an adequate explanation for changing those individuals. They were concerned about the language of the resignations and about Fidel's comments."" Interestingly, Pastor said, ""They blamed Fidel more than they seemed to blame Raul."" Perez, the Cuba scholar, also noted Fidel Castro's apparent passing from power. ""Nobody speaks of Fidel anymore,"" Perez said. ""He's a non-presence. Out of sight, out of mind. The only time anyone speaks of him is when they are asked about him.""","Former Mexican foreign minister says Raul Castro removed two top-ranking officials .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Surviving victims and family members of the Fort Hood massacre testified in emotional terms Monday over their personal trauma and grief, as the sentencing phase for the convicted murderer's court-martial moved quickly toward a dramatic conclusion. A military jury could begin considering by late Tuesday whether Maj. Nidal Hasan will get capital punishment for the horrific November 2009 shootings on this sprawling Army base. The Army Medical Corps officer was convicted Friday on all 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in connection with the shooting rampage at a Fort Hood deployment processing center. The incident occurred about a month before Hasan was to deploy to Afghanistan. ""I was expected to either die or remain in a vegetative state,"" said Staff Sgt. Patrick Zeigler, who was shot four times, including in the head. He recovered, but his left side remains partially paralyzed, and he said Monday that he struggles to cope with the injuries. ""It's affected every facet of my personality,"" he testified. ""I am a lot angrier, a lot darker than I used to be."" Twenty percent of Zeigler's brain was removed in the initial surgery, and he has had more than 10 additional procedures. He leaves the service in October on medical retirement but said he will never be fully functional. Prison or death for Hasan? It's up to the jury now . Prosecutors began presenting the first of 19 witnesses, including a liaison or family member for each victim killed in the attack. They began describing the impact the shootings had on their lives, part of the ""aggravating"" evidence the prosecution will use to try to demonstrate why Hasan deserves lethal injection. A dozen victims and family members took the stand before the court-martial unexpectedly recessed for the day at midafternoon. Base officials would cite only ""logistical issues"" for the delay and said the judge was meeting in chambers with Hasan, who serves as his own attorney. The defendant -- who was wounded by military police in the attacks and paralyzed -- repeatedly asked the bench Monday to take brief breaks from the public proceedings, but the court offered no explanations. Proceedings resume Tuesday morning. During the nearly three-week trial phase, military prosecutors called 89 witnesses and submitted more than 700 pieces of evidence. Unclear is whether Hasan himself will now present testimony or speak on his own behalf. He serves as his own attorney and has refused to put on a defense in court. The American-born psychiatrist of Palestinian descent has the opportunity to offer ""mitigating"" evidence that could persuade the panel to spare his life. He refused to cross-examine any of the victims and their families testifying. Angela Rivera lost her husband, Maj. Libardo Caraveo, a 52-year-old clinical psychologist preparing to deploy to Afghanistan when he was gunned down. When officials rang her doorbell to inform her of the news, 14 hours after the shooting, ""All I could say was, I knew it, I just knew he was dead, because he did not call me back"" after the incident. Rivera and Caraveo had three children living in the house at the time, including a 2-year-old. Rivera testified that her 12-year-old daughter was distraught, quoting her as saying, "" 'Mom, I hope who did this understands the pain he has caused all these families.' "" An older daughter could not cope, became suicidal and remains emotionally troubled, Rivera said. The father of Pvt. Francheska Velez said Hasan's action's left him devastated. His 21-year-old daughter was pregnant at the time of the premeditated murders. ""This man did not just kill 13 people,"" Juan Velez testified in Spanish. ""He killed my (unborn) grandson, and he killed me slowly."" Pfc. Kham Xiong, 23, left behind a widow and three small children. ""We can only imagine"" what might have been, Shoua Her said quietly. ""These past few years haven't been easy being a single mother. ... I miss him a lot, his soft gentle hands, how he held me and made me feel safe and secure. ""I feel dead, yet I'm alive,"" she added, wiping away tears. On his own initiative, Hasan admitted early in the court-martial, ""The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter."" He has also indicated a willingness to die as a ""martyr."" Judge Col. Tara Osborn is likely to instruct the military panel to ignore any direct pleas from Hasan that he be given lethal injection but to decide punishment only on the facts and testimony presented, in accordance with the law. The stakes in the penalty phase create an unusual dynamic in what was already a very unusual case. ""The U.S. military is not used to this kind of defendant, who apparently wants to die for his crimes. It might take a terrible weight off the jury -- if the inmate wants death, they may say, 'we'll accommodate.' It lessens the burden,"" said Richard Dieter of the Death Penalty Information Center. ""On the other hand, the military by its nature, and in this time of war, sees a lot of death. They may not desire to add to it and give (Hasan) what he may want. His wishes might have a reverse effect."" But Hasan's confessed rampage against innocents on a domestic military base will be an important consideration for the panel considering his fate. History may not be on Hasan's or the government's side. The last military execution was in 1961, and only five servicemen sit on death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The military has its own legal standards and procedures when trying and appealing capital cases. The U.S. Supreme Court gets the final say, if any petition reaches that far.

(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund smashed six goals past Hamburg at the Signal Iduna Park on Saturday evening to record their best ever start to a Bundesliga season. The 6-2 victory gives Jurgen Klopp's side a maximum 15 points from their opening five fixtures and keeps them two points clear of title rivals Bayern Munich. Dortmund raced into a 2-0 lead midway through the first half with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang opening the scoring in the 19th minute and Henrikh Mkhitaryan adding a second three minutes later. Zhi Gin Lam pulled one back for the visitors in the 26th minute and shortly after the break a Heiko Westermann header leveled the scores. Dortmund restored their advantage in the 65th minute when Aubameyang scored his second of the night before the floodgates opened eight minutes later as Robert Lewandowski netted followed by Marco Reus a minute later.

"(CNN) -- Somali forces clashed with al Qaeda-linked militants in the capital city Friday after the militants attacked an African Union peacekeeping station, according to an independent media report. Al Shabaab fighters display two bodies of Somali police officers during a battle August 12 in Mogadishu. Al Shabaab militants attacked the African Union Mission to Somalia headquarters in downtown Mogadishu, according to Somalia's independent Shabelle Radio. The attack sparked a firefight with government forces, Shabelle Radio said . This is the latest fighting in Somalia's war-torn capital in the ongoing war between government forces and the Islamist militia. At least 46 people have been killed and 65 wounded in two days of fighting in Mogadishu, Somali officials said Friday. The government forces are being aided by the African Union's peacekeeping force, which is mainly made up of Ugandan and Burundian forces. Meanwhile, the al Qaeda-linked Islamist militia seized control of the central town of Bulo Burde from government forces, killing 15, Shabelle Radio and witnesses said. Bulo Burde is about 155 miles (250 kilometers) southeast of Mogadishu. Ongoing clashes between the two sides trapped people in the town Thursday, witnesses said. A spokesman for Somalia's president announced Thursday morning that pro-government fighters had seized control of Bulo Burde, which is considered a strategic town because it lies on a major road between Mogadishu and Somalia's central regions. But later in the day, after residents reported heavy fighting, the Islamist fighters regained control of the town and the pro-government forces withdrew to about a kilometer outside Bulo Burde, witnesses said. The United States is supporting Somali government's fight against the insurgents, including providing weapons to government forces. Al Shabaab is on the U.S. list of terror organizations because of its ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. U.S. officials are concerned that Somalia's weak government could fall to the Islamist insurgency, as it did in 2006 before Ethiopian forces ousted the militants from power later that year.","Somali forces fighting al Qaeda-linked Al Shabaab in capital city of Mogadishu .

"Amsterdam (CNN) -- I recently returned to Amsterdam from the latest round of U.N. climate talks in Cancun, Mexico, and found this city of canals covered in snow. It was a beautiful sight. Yet rather than filling me with joy, it caused me concern. Over the past few years, climate-change skeptics have repeatedly used cold snaps as proof that our planet is not heating up. This argument ignores NASA's recent analysis of 2010 as the warmest year on record and the World Meteorological Organization's pronouncement of the first decade of this century as the hottest since records began. Global warming does not simply mean that temperatures are always climbing. What it does mean is that although our planet is steadily heating up, a delicate set of climatic imbalances creates an increase in extreme weather events. These may include both dramatic heat spells and powerful snowstorms, such as those that have blanketed parts of Europe not used to seeing such weather -- as well as the more southerly reaches of the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S. Most scientists tell us that we must dramatically curb greenhouse gas emissions if we are to avert catastrophic climate change. To do this, it will be necessary to mobilize people around the globe who are not yet concerned about the issue. But if the scientific evidence can be buried, in the eyes of some, by a single heavy snowfall, then we must have new strategies that generate interest in this complex issue and sustain public and political support for action. Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Joel Pett may have hit upon something with a cartoon he drew for last year's climate talks in Copenhagen, Denmark. It shows a scientist addressing a large audience at a climate summit. A spectator at the left side of the panel asks his neighbor: ""What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?"" The answer emerges on the right side of the panel where the following list appears on a chalkboard: energy independence, preserve rainforest, sustainability, green jobs, livable cities, renewables, clean water and air, healthy children, etc., etc. There is indeed something for almost everyone in climate protection. A small nonprofit group called the Climate and Energy Project ran with this idea in 2007. It sponsored a yearlong competition between six towns in Kansas with the goal of getting them to lower carbon emissions. They did this by reducing their energy consumption and accepting renewable sources of energy. A study had shown that a majority of residents in that region believed either that climate change was a hoax or that recent dramatic weather events were simply the result of natural climate cycles. Organizers decided to highlight the more immediate benefits of cutting carbon emissions, including energy independence, development of the local economy and financial savings. The New York Times reported in October that the project's strategy seems to have worked. In a year, the article read, ""energy use in the towns declined as much as 5 percent relative to other areas -- a giant step in the world of energy conservation, where a program that yields a 1.5 percent decline is considered successful."" Most of the world's major religions also offer reasons to engage in climate protection. Because taking care of the poor and needy (often disproportionately affected by climate-related disasters) and protecting God's planet are tenets of most of the world's major faith-based organizations, environmental protection is commonly becoming part of what they preach. Some Muslim and Hindu groups, for example, are working on special product labeling that would inform consumers about environmental impacts of the items being purchased. Similarly, around the globe, diverse organizations -- including trade unions, churches, non-governmental organizations and governments -- are coming together to find solutions to climate change. In 2010, the fossil fuel industry offered, albeit by accident, one of the greatest motivations to take action on global warming. BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulted in the death of 11 rig workers; local economies suffered deeply, and wildlife in the region could take decades to recover. The continued disintegration of public trust in government and business policy and procedures surrounding the disaster will, justifiably, have repercussions for a long time to come. Speaking with a Dutch friend, I commented that the snow -- which has caused great travel difficulties around Europe -- was at least a wonderful thing for children, who are out in force making snowmen. ""Yes,"" he replied, but when I was growing up, winters were so cold the canals would freeze over every year, and we could skate on them. Last year was the first time this happened again in over a decade. The world is no longer as we knew it. It is not possible to backtrack on climate change. It is, however, still within our power to help preserve our planet for future generations. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kumi Naidoo.","Kumi Naidoo said Amsterdam snow delightful, but he feared it would fuel global warming denial .

"London, England (CNN) -- Conservative Party leader David Cameron was appointed as British prime minister on Tuesday following the resignation of Gordon Brown, whose Labour Party was defeated in Thursday's general election. Cameron traveled to Buckingham Palace where he was invited to form a government by Queen Elizabeth. So what will happen in the near future? When does David Cameron take office? Cameron arrived at the prime minister's official Downing Street residence early Wednesday morning to begin work on agreeing the final details of his coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. Brown left the building for the last time on Tuesday evening. Full election coverage . How will the next government work? The Conservative Party won 306 seats in the election, which is 20 seats short of a parliamentary majority, so it needs the cooperation of other, smaller parties, especially on contentious legislation. On Tuesday the center-right party agreed a deal to govern in coalition with the centrist Liberal Democrats to form a ""strong and stable"" administration. This will give it a notional majority of 86 if all Conservative and Lib Dem MPs vote with the government. Who will be in the government? Nick Clegg and other leading Liberal Democrats look to be the big winners from the coalition deal with Clegg appointed Deputy Prime Minister, although it remains unclear exactly what brief that role will entail. The Liberal Democrats are expected to hold five ministerial posts in the Cabinet. But the Conservatives hold on to two senior offices of state, with George Osborne named Chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance minister, and William Hague appointed foreign secretary. What is the agenda of the new government? The government is expected to unveil an emergency budget within weeks as the UK continues to recover from the economic crisis. Cameron said reducing the huge budget deficit was his priority along with tackling the social problems that Britain faced. The Liberal Democrats favored delaying public spending cuts while the economic recovery remained fragile. But both parties have been forced to compromise on key policies in reaching a deal to work together. The Conservatives have pledged ¬£6 billion ($9 billion) in spending cuts this year. They will also scrap a planned increase in National Insurance contributions -- a form of tax funding healthcare and welfare benefits -- paid by employers which they said would damage the economy. But the Liberal Democrats have achieved a concession that will see the personal tax threshold raised to ¬£10,000 ($15,000) -- a key manifesto pledge they say will benefit lower-paid workers. Liberal Democrat demands for electoral reform have been partially accommodated with the government pledging a referendum on moving to an ""Alternative Vote"" system. But the Lib Dems have dropped for now their opposition to the replacement of the UK's Trident independent nuclear deterrent. What are the potential stumbling blocks? The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have very different policies on Europe, the UK's nuclear deterrent, immigration and, crucially, electoral reform. Will a coalition impede the workings of government and will it make it more difficult to get laws passed? There is no reason why a coalition government should necessarily work any differently to one formed by a single party. The party leaders will need to agree on the government's agenda, laid out in the Queen's Speech later this month. How effective the government is in passing new laws depends on lawmakers in both parties of course. If Liberal Democrats are rebellious they will vote against the government, and if they bring it down, by forcing a no-confidence motion, they risk sparking another general election. Is a second general election likely? Cameron has the right to call a new election at any time; he may do so if he feels in a strong enough position and if he feels the Lib Dems are not allowing him to pursue his agenda. Who is the opposition? The Labour Party is now in opposition along with other smaller parties, and its deputy leader Harriet Harman will be interim leader as well as leader of the opposition following Brown's resignation as Labour leader earlier in the week. Do officials in Downing Street remain in their jobs? Members of the Civil Service are non-partisan, and work with a government formed by any party. The civil servants thus remain in their posts, and help with the transition of the new government. How often does Britain have coalition governments? They are very rare in British politics. The last time Britain had a hung parliament was in February 1974, when Edward Heath's Conservatives gained more votes but fewer seats in Parliament than Labour. Unable to form a deal with the Liberal Party, the Conservatives stayed on in a minority government, but found themselves back at the polls by October. The last coalition to rule the UK was formed in response to the crisis of World War II, with Conservative Winston Churchill leading an all-party administration between 1940 and 1945.","Conservative Party leader David Cameron appointed as British prime minister .

"(CNN) -- Florida authorities have a message as the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial looms: raise your voice, not your hands. Anticipating that the outcome of the very public, and racially-tinged, case is likely to disappoint one swath of the population or another, law enforcement agencies have set up a response plan. Part of it is a public service announcement that the Broward County Sheriff's Office released this week. In it, a black teenage boy and a Hispanic girl urge viewers to ""stand together as one. No cuffs, no guns."" Zimmerman is a white Hispanic who is on trial for last year's shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a black teen, in Sanford city. Sanford is in Seminole County. He is charged with second-degree murder, and says he acted in self-defense. Prosecutors are arguing he profiled the teen. Opinion: Zimmerman trial -- it's about race . Millions of Americans have already made up their minds about what should happen. And no matter how the verdict falls, authorities worry passions will be inflamed. That's where the video comes in -- a plea not to resort to violence. ""Freedom of expression is a constitutional right,"" the sheriff's office said. ""While raising your voice is encouraged, using your hands is not."" In the video, the boy says, ""Let's give violence a rest, because we can easily end up arrested."" The girl adds, ""Let it roll off your shoulders. It's water off your back, don't lack composure. Because in one instant it could be over."" In Zimmerman trial, it's a jury of millions . The case has triggered a nationwide debate about Florida's ""Stand Your Ground"" law, race and racial profiling. ""People care about gun rights. People care about race. People care about children. People care about the right to defend yourself,"" said CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin. ""And this case has all of them wrapped up together, and that's rare."" Zimmerman's lawyer, Mark O'Mara, told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live"" that regardless of the outcome, his client will forever be looking over his shoulder: . ""First of all, my client will never be safe, because there are a percentage of the population who are angry, they're upset, and they may well take it out on him,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Every awards ceremony has its reputation, and MTV's Video Music Awards proudly wears the badge of scandal. Where the Oscars are elegant and the Golden Globes rowdy, the VMAs are all about testing the boundaries of what culture deems ""decent"" and reveling in youthful (and, yes, sometimes immature) freedom. This reputation was cemented from the first VMAs broadcast in 1984, when a then-26-year-old Madonna sensually writhed on stage in a wedding dress to ""Like A Virgin."" At the time, she was told her antics would ruin her career -- when in fact the opposite happened. It's now one of the most well-known moments not only from the VMAs, but from the now 55-year-old's legendary career. Countless pop stars and rockers have followed in Madge's footsteps, with each new year bearing the promise of an ever-shocking performance. MTV VMAs: From Courtney to Kanye, why I know to expect the unexpected . So when Miley Cyrus took the VMAs stage on Sunday and proceeded to provocatively dance (with teddy bears, no less) before removing even more clothing, was she committing the offense the Internet has claimed, or simply upholding 30 years of VMAs tradition? With her striptease, 20-year-old Cyrus didn't do anything her predecessors haven't already. In 2000, Britney Spears was not yet 19 when she ripped off a pantsuit at the VMAs to reveal a sparkling, flesh-toned body stocking underneath. As host network MTV has said of the memorable moment, Spears' ""striptease (not to mention the accompanying panting and grinding) served notice that Britney was no longer the pigtailed schoolgirl of the '... Baby One More Time' video, but rather a full-grown, supremely sexy woman."" The singer followed up that headline-making move by dancing seductively with a snake in 2001. In 2003, as a callback to the VMA original ""Like a Virgin"" performance, Spears and Christina Aguilera wore wedding white for the performance. And then there was the famous Spears kiss with Madonna. When that scene threw Spears back into the crossfire, the pop star told CNN that she was just ""performing and expressing myself."" And need we remind you of Nirvana's havoc-filled performance of ""Lithium"" in 1992, or Diana Ross feeling up Lil Kim's bare breast in 1999? (If you need a refresher, recall that Lil Kim was wearing a violet bodysuit that exposed one breast, which was covered with nothing more than a matching purple pasty.) Howard Stern, Marilyn Manson, Prince and Lady Gaga (the latter was at this very same show!) have all bared their bums for MTV's viewers. 6 memorable moments from the 2013 VMAs . To be sure, Cyrus' Sunday performance took notes from all of the above and combined them into one show-stealing set. But that's more or less what the VMAs have historically been: A place to go wild (within reach of censors), and a platform for young stars to show the world that they're now adults, perhaps even one that feels comfortable bending over in front of an audience and dancing in a latex two-piece. Yet the reaction to Cyrus appears to be more eviscerating than previous years. Some viewers were in awe that this is the same Cyrus who was once the Disney Channel's teen queen on ""Hannah Montana,"" and others aghast at the provocativeness of her performance. ""Raise your hand if you feel personally victimized by Miley Cyrus' #VMAs performance,"" tweeted E! Online. ""Do you think (Miley's dad) Billy Ray Cyrus woke up with an achy breaky heart this morning after his little girl's performance at the VMAs last night?"" said Lady Antebellum's Charles Kelly. Judd Apatow, posting a picture of Cyrus from her 2012 movie ""So Undercover,"" tweeted that he'll ""always have this version of Miley. Let's live in the past and heal."" Cyrus herself has been silent about her set and its overwhelming reaction, but anyone who's paid the slightest attention to the star wouldn't be too surprised by her routine. Although she rose to fame on ""Hannah Montana,"" a role she landed at just 13, Cyrus has always had a rocky relationship with the squeaky clean image she was expected to uphold. At 15, the singer/actress came under fire after she posed topless for Vanity Fair, holding a sheet to her chest as she gazed at the camera. The following year, Cyrus was criticized for her Teen Choice Awards performance, during which she danced atop an ice cream cart -- complete with a pole -- while singing her hit, ""Party in the U.S.A."" The moment would infamously become known as Cyrus' ""pole dance."" She was 16. In the days following her 18th birthday in 2010, Cyrus was subjected to more scrutiny when a video surfaced of the star smoking a bong apparently filled with salvia. The attention has only increased in the years since, as Cyrus has tried to transition from her Disney days into being a grown-up pop star, complete with an eye-catching haircut and the occasional middle finger thrown up in photographs. While her critics have been vocal about their discomfort with her behavior, Cyrus has said that she's simply being herself. Speaking on her new album, ""Bangerz,"" to Billboard magazine, she said that she feels like ""I can really be myself. ... I really have more of a connection of who I am, and I feel like I can maybe express that more in my music now."" Basically, we're hearing Britney Spears 2.0. The moves Madonna and Spears once performed at the VMAs are now an indelible part of pop culture history, moments that make the VMAs appointment-viewing after 29 years. (BuzzFeed, for example, has come up with an astonishing 95 reasons why the ""VMAs are absolutely nothing without Britney Spears."") Will Cyrus' 2013 performance receive the same fate? It's far too early to tell. But if the legacy of the MTV VMAs is any indication, she's going to express what she wants -- whether we like it or not.","Miley Cyrus stunned viewers at Sunday's MTV VMAs .

"(CNN) -- Remember when we all waved at Saturn last month while the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft took our picture? Well, NASA has finally gotten the film back from the drugstore -- and you can see our whole world. A good chunk of it, anyway. People shared more than 1,400 images of themselves as part of the July 19 ""Wave at Saturn"" event, which was organized by NASA's Cassini mission. On Tuesday, the space agency released a collage of those images, which -- from a distance -- looks like the portion of the Earth's Western Hemisphere that Cassini viewed at the time. Zoom in, however, and you can see everyday folks expressing their oneness with the ringed sixth planet from the sun. (The full-resolution version is here.) ""Hello Cassini,"" says a chalked message in one photo. ""Thanks for helping Earth wave at me today. Love, Saturn,"" read a handheld sign in another. NASA was thankful, too. ""Thanks to all of you, near and far, old and young, who joined the Cassini mission in marking the first time inhabitants of Earth had advance notice that our picture was being taken from interplanetary distances,"" said Cassini project scientist Linda Spilker in a statement released by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ""While Earth is too small in the images Cassini obtained to distinguish any individual human beings, the mission has put together this collage so that we can celebrate all your waving hands, uplifted paws, smiling faces and artwork."" The images came from 30 states and 40 countries. People used a variety of technologies to transmit them, including Instagram, Google+ and e-mail. Cassini took a picture of Earth as part of a larger set of images it was collecting of the Saturn system. Scientists are busy putting together the color mosaic of the Saturn system, which they expect will take at least several more weeks to complete. The scientists who study Saturn's rings are poring over visible-light and infrared data obtained during that campaign. The project originated because the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft, which was launched in 1997 and has been in orbit around Saturn since 2004, was going to be taking pictures of the planet and its rings during a solar eclipse. Thanks to various cosmological arrangements, the Earth was minutely visible in the endless universe beyond. The picture of Earth, though it doesn't reveal much scientifically, was a rare opportunity, NASA noted in July. ""Since the Space Age began, there have been only two images of Earth from the outer solar system,"" the agency said. And now, there are more -- and one that features so many of us. Hope you didn't blink.","NASA releases photo mosaic of people waving at Saturn .

"Homs, Syria (CNN) -- Government soldiers in Homs are showing the strain of war against opposition forces the government refers to as ""terrorists."" But they told CNN that, despite enduring many casualties, their morale has not flagged. Though Homs has been the site of urban combat for two years, the soldiers -- from the front line to checkpoints -- appeared largely combat-ready. Much has been reported about abuses allegedly committed by soldiers fighting for the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Those allegations include the indiscriminate use of heavy weapons -- tanks, artillery and war planes -- in urban areas. The United Nations says both the Syrian army and opposition forces have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. But here, the losses were personal on Friday, as a family grieved for their child, a soldier in al-Assad's army. Ali Suleiman was 19 when he was killed last week on the front, his mother, Abeer Suleiman, told CNN. ""Him on the front lines was painful for me, but I was with him, hand in hand, defending this country,"" she told CNN, adding that his body had not yet been returned to her. ""I handed him to God, a sacrifice for the homeland."" The Syrian government says its army is on the offensive against the ""terrorists."" But the access given to CNN to a hospital here underscored the price Syrian soldiers are paying. Twenty were killed and a number of others were wounded in a recent suicide attack at an army base. ""The first explosion was at the gate,"" a soldier recalled. ""We went out, and it was awful seeing our comrades on the ground. As we went out, a second car came. We opened fire, but he drove into the building. The explosion caused the whole building and residential houses to collapse."" A hospital doctor likened the casualties here to those seen by doctors in other combat zones. ""It is the same terrorism the Europeans and Americans faced in Iraq and Afghanistan and allowed the French to fight outside their country in Mali,"" said the doctor, Gen. Bashir Hadidi. The Syrian government has granted rare access to CNN. Officials have accompanied the journalists, whose movements are restricted. After nearly two years of such fighting, Syria's information minister called Friday for a national dialogue to end the civil war, the government-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. ""Omran al-Zoubi said that dialogue in the preliminary stage must cover the widest possible spectrum of Syrians, stressing that Syria is heading towards a national dialogue conference and there's no turning back from that, voicing readiness to invite everyone including coordinators and those who abandon weapons to engage in dialogue and affirming that none of those who respond to this national call will be harmed,"" SANA reported, citing an interview on Syrian TV. Al-Zoubi said that the Syrian Arab Red Crescent was contacting Syrians who have fled to neighboring countries -- ""regardless of reason or political opinion -- to arrange their return, stressing that Syria is the homeland of all Syrians and that none of those who return will be detained or punished."" Those numbers are increasing, with 5,000 Syrians crossing borders each day, according to Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. In all, ""787,000 Syrians are now registered or being assisted as refugees,"" he said, up from 414,000 in mid-December. ""There has been a huge increase in January alone; we're talking about a 25% increase in registered refugee numbers over a single month."" Opposition members have said they will not work directly with al-Assad's ""criminal"" government, nor will they accept any solution that doesn't involve al-Assad's departure. The calls for dialogue came as the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported 121 people were killed Friday, 42 of them in Damascus and its suburbs.","NEW: Doctor likens the casualties to those seen in Iraq and Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- A candidate in Australia's parliamentary elections referred to Islam as a country. As a result, she's now referred to as a former candidate.

""I don't oppose Islam as a country, but I do feel that their laws should not be welcome here in Australia,"" Banister said. Then she added: ""Less than 2% of Australians follow haram."" It is unclear whether she meant the Muslim holy book, the Quran. Haram refers to things that are forbidden under Islamic law. As if that's not enough, she got her religions all mixed up. Australia's Abbott makes 'suppository of all wisdom' gaffe . ""Jews aren't under haram, they have their own religion which follows Jesus Christ,"" she said. Judaism is based on the old testament, which predates the birth of Jesus Christ. Her blunders, though, were not limited to religion. She said the Australian national disability insurance scheme was ""working at the moment."" It is not set to begin until 2016, according to 7 News.

"(CNN) -- Bad news: Your Facebook page is likely about to slow down. Good news: The change will help keep online thieves away. According to a recent blog post, Facebook is in the process of moving all of its users in North America -- and soon the rest of the world -- to a type of Internet connection that is more secure but also tends to slow down Web browsing a bit. Called HTTPS, as opposed to less-secure HTTP, it's the connection you see on online retail sites when you're about to enter credit card information or a password. Sometimes a little lock icon appears in the browser window when you're connected to a site with HTTPS. (The ""s,"" by the way, stands for ""secure."") ""As the Web evolves, expectations around security change,"" Facebook's Alex Rice wrote last year when he announced that HTTPS would become an option on Facebook. ""For example, HTTPS -- once a technology used primarily on banking and e-commerce sites -- is now becoming the norm for any Web app that stores user information."" The new change is that Facebook is starting make HTTPS the default setting for all its 1 billion-plus users, so people who haven't selected that option soon will get added security -- and, potentially, slower browsing. ""People will be able to opt-out of HTTPS for maximum speed if that's how they roll,"" according to the blog TechCrunch. ""It is far from a simple task to build out this capability for the more than a billion people that use the site and retain the stability and speed we expect,"" Facebook's Frederic Wolens told that tech news site, ""but we are making progress daily towards this end. ""This may slow down connections only slightly, but we have deployed significant performance enhancements to our load balancing infrastructure to mitigate most of the impact of moving to HTTPS, and will be continuing this work as we deploy this feature."" How will you know whether you're using HTTPS or HTTP? Look at the top of your browser window, where you enter Internet addresses. If you go to Facebook and see https://facebook.com in that box, then you're browsing on the more-secure connection, which scrambles data as it sends it back and forth to Facebook's servers, making it more difficult for someone in the middle to nab your passwords or other sensitive data. ""Think of it like this: you're having a private conversation with your new boyfriend or girlfriend, and your ex -- unbeknownst to you -- is a few tables over listening to every word,"" the blog Lifehacker writes in a post titled ""WTF is HTTPS."" ""That's the sort of risk HTTP poses, whereas HTTPS would be more like if you and your new romantic interest were speaking a new language that only the two of you understood. To your stalker of an ex, this information would sound like gibberish and s/he wouldn't get any value from listening if s/he tried. ""HTTPS is a way for you to exchange information with a web site securely so you don't have to worry about anyone trying to listen in."" Other online services, including Gmail, already use HTTPS by default.","Facebook is moving to HTTPS connections by default .
That may result in slowed speeds for some users .
The switch is designed to offer additional security .
People who are unhappy with the change can opt out ."
"Alexandria, Egypt (CNN) -- Can jumping spiders still hunt for their prey in space? It may sound like science fiction or the start of a bad joke, but this is an experiment that will be carried out on the International Space Station later this year, thanks to Egyptian teenager Amr Mohamed. Mohamed, 19, from Alexandria, came up with one of the two winning entries from around the world for the YouTube Space Lab competition, backed by Professor Stephen Hawking, which asked students to design experiments for space scientists. The idea behind Mohamed's experiment is to study how the zebra spider, which jumps on its prey rather than building a web, will hunt when it is in zero gravity. It was conceived through Mohamed's fascination with both science and spiders. ""I'm just interested in how things work, and science seems to answer all my questions,"" said Mohamed. ""For example, physics can explain the world with just a handful of equations. And biology tells you how your body works. I'm just interested in that stuff."" Mohamed only heard about the Space Lab competition three days before the deadline, so he designed and made a YouTube video of his idea in a single day. He said he was reading about which animals had been in space, and discovered orb weaver spiders among them. ""They were very interesting because they build the knots differently,"" said Mohamed. ""So I say, OK, they can survive, let's make things a little harder. Let's get a kind of spider that can't build webs in space and that actually gravity is a factor in the way it hunts, so that's how the idea came. ""I just started writing a script and turned the camera on and explained my experiment and edited the video and it was online before the day was over."" Mohamed was announced as a regional finalist and after a week of public voting was invited to Washington DC as a regional winner to experience a zero-gravity flight. Also on Inside the Middle East: The film director who's not allowed to go to the movies . During the trip, Mohamed and a two-girl team from Troy, Michigan, were announced as global winners whose experiments will be taken to the International Space Station. Mohamed is currently taking a gap year before studying at Stanford University, California, in the fall. He said: ""Before the competition, I was just a kid struggling with my A-levels. Out of the huge ocean of the internet, the tide brought me Space Lab. So right now, I know where I want to be. I know who I want to be."" Mohamed's achievement is particularly impressive as Egypt's math and science education came 125th out of 139 nations in a World Economic Forum survey. ""There's not many Egyptians in the field of science and technology,"" said Mohamed. ""Egypt is not at the front of innovation. When it comes to technology or science, we're always consumers, we're never producers."" Mohamed's education was disrupted during last year's revolution, when his school was closed for several months. ""There was so much stress and nobody knew where this was going,"" he said. ""We had to protect the streets, so we formed committees to protect the streets. ""I had a curriculum to study, and we didn't know when the revolution was going to end or when this is going to stop, or when the school is going to get back. So we had to go on. I had to study and do the patrolling and and from time to time join the protests."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Mideast women beat men in education . Mohamed hopes one day to help change Egyptian attitudes to science through his passion. ""If I'm going to work in the field of science or technology, I might be able to bring the cultural or regional problems that people of the Middle East have into the field for tackling to solve them,"" said Mohamed. Mohamed's mother, Safaa El Badbooly, saw his potential early. ""Each person rises in a certain field, but for Amr it was reading all along. He read a lot and in everything. He was reading books at age three,"" she said. She, too, hopes that after her son has studied abroad, he will return to Egypt to create a better future. ""To benefit his country and maybe start a project like many others who came back and developed Egypt to benefit their own people,"" she said.

"London, England (CNN) -- The British election has ended in a hung parliament, as official returns show it is impossible for any one party to get a majority of seats. The leader of the largest party traditionally gets the first chance to form the government and become prime minister. But if no party has a majority, the sitting prime minister -- currently Gordon Brown -- has the right to stay in office and try to win a confidence motion in parliament. Hung parliaments are unusual in Britain. The last time it happened, in 1974, voters were back at the polls within months. CNN's Political Contributor Robin Oakley, a veteran of 12 UK elections, answers questions about a hung parliament. What exactly is a ""hung parliament?"" To enjoy a governing majority in the parliament, a party -- realistically either the Conservatives, led by David Cameron, or the ruling Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Gordon Brown -- needed to win a minimum of 326 seats. That's more than half the total of 650 being contested. A ""hung parliament"" is one in which no single party reaches that minimum number. Without a majority in parliament, a government becomes dependent on MPs -- or lawmakers -- from other parties to get its program voted through the House of Commons, the chamber which passes laws and legislation. Labour ended the parliament dissolved on April 12 with an effective working majority of 56. But the party only had to lose 24 seats to forfeit its majority due to some lawmakers not taking their places in the chamber (such as those from Northern Ireland's Sinn Fein), some lawmakers not having a vote (such as the speaker) and some seats being vacant. So didn't the Conservatives get the most votes? So they did. But the electoral arithmetic makes things more complicated. England, Scotland and Wales do not have proportional representation. Instead the British use the first-past-the-post voting system where winner takes all. The general election is not just a national contest but in effect a mini-election in every one of those 650 parliamentary constituencies. And because of a bias currently built into the British system, the Conservatives in practice need a lead of more than 10 points in their share of the vote to be sure of winning even a single-seat majority. The boundaries of parliamentary seats are periodically revised to keep them close to a notional average size. But the officials charged with the task, and the lengthy appeals process over their decisions, ensure that parliamentary seat sizes don't keep pace with population changes. Currently the distribution favors Labour, which tends to spread its vote more evenly across the country and to win a large number of seats by small majorities, particularly amid the shrinking populations of inner cities. The Conservatives, by contrast, rack up huge majorities of ""surplus"" votes in some safe rural and suburban seats. One way to appreciate the inequity of the system is to note that in the 2005 election it took Labour on average 26,872 votes to win a Parliamentary seat. The Conservatives averaged 44,531 votes per seat and the Liberal Democrats 96,485. Labour's share of the national vote last time was just 36 per cent. But thanks to the way the system worked, that gave them 57 per cent of the seats in parliament. The Conservatives needed to gain an extra 116 seats to have the barest majority of their own -- and they needed around a 10-point margin for that. When did Britain last have a hung parliament. How likely is it this time? The last time a hung parliament happened in Britain was in 1974. But election experts say that the prospects of a repeat have been increasing. Back in the 1960s, the two major parties, Labour and Conservatives used to take around 95 per cent of the vote between them. At the last general election in 2005 they aggregated less than 70 per cent. Not only have the Liberal Democrats advanced (they took 62 seats last time with 23 per cent of the vote) but so have other smaller parties. In Scotland and Wales in 2005 the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru (Welsh Nationalists) won 10 seats between them. And in local government contests and European Parliament elections, fringe parties like the Greens, the British National Party and the United Kingdom Independence Party have shown their ability to collect significant voting support. Winning a national majority is getting harder and the expenses scandals of the last parliament may boost support for minority parties that are apparently less tainted by them. What happened in the last hung parliament? Why are financiers and business people seemingly so jumpy about the possibility of another? Edward Heath, the then Conservative Prime Minister, called an election in February 1974 on the theme of ""Who runs the country?"" after battles with the trades unions. He failed to win a majority but took a bigger share of the national vote than Labour, which had four more seats than his Tories (301 to 297). Heath tried to stay in power, seeking to persuade the Liberals to back him. They would not and so his opponent, Harold Wilson, formed a minority Labour government. Wilson called a second election that year, in October, and that time won an overall majority of three seats. Part of the agitation in some financial circles about the possibility of a hung parliament on May 6 derives from sheer novelty. The first-past-the-post system has so often produced a definite election result that City and currency speculators are suggesting that a minority government -- or a coalition of two or more parties -- would not be strong enough to take tough decisions at a time when the parlous state of the British economy needs decision and consistency at the top. But many European countries where proportional voting systems regularly produce minority or coalition governments seem to manage their economies perfectly adequately. And some calmer Westminster and City voices have pointed out that Britain managed to run its affairs during World War II with a coalition government. So what is likely to happen this time? That is the hardest question. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader whose party could hold the balance of power, says that he won't play kingmaker. That, he says, is a task for voters. He adds: ""Whichever party has the strongest mandate from the British people it seems to me they have the first right to try and govern."" All fine and dandy, except that he didn't say whether that ""mandate"" should be determined by which party had the most seats or which had the biggest share of the national vote -- which wouldn't necessarily be the same thing. Clegg would not be keen to earn the ire of the British people by putting Gordon Brown back in 10 Downing Street, when British voters had refused to renew Labour's majority. But nor would his party stomach him working with the Euroskeptic Conservatives. The money therefore goes on a minority government rather than a coalition.","A ""hung parliament"" is when no party has the minimum number of seats to enjoy a governing majority .

"(CNN) -- The specter of U.S. military intervention in Syria prompted dire warnings from Iran's supreme leader, new president, and top diplomat, according to Iran's Fars News Agency. Talk of U.S. military action against Syria's Bashar al-Assad regime emerged after what rebels say was a deadly chemical attack by the regime that killed civilians last week. Since then, a flurry of comments and activity seems to be laying the groundwork for a military strike against the regime. At the same time, United Nations inspectors are looking for evidence that chemical weapons were used in the Damascus suburbs. The mounting tension has brought warnings from leaders in Iran, a longtime supporter of the al-Assad regime. ""Starting this fire will be like a spark in a large store of gunpowder, with unclear and unspecified outcomes and consequences,"" Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told Iranian Cabinet members in Tehran on Wednesday. Syria strikes could worsen war, analysts say . ""The U.S. threats and possible intervention in Syria is a disaster for the region and if such an act is done, certainly, the Americans will sustain damage like when they interfered in Iraq and Afghanistan."" President Hassan Rouhani, also speaking to the Cabinet, said people in the Middle East and the world won't accept ""a new war"" and deplored threats to use force. ""Any adventurism in the region will pose irreparable dangers to the stability of the region and the world and will merely lead to the spread of extremism and terrorism in the region,"" Rouhani said. 'Red line' debate: Chemical weapons worse than attacks? He called on the U.N. inspectors to carry out unbiased investigations to identify the culprits behind the chemical weapons use in Syria, and said, ""Each and every measure should be taken with respect to the sensitive situation of the region, rapid ending of the internal crisis, and prevention of extremism in the region and in the framework of the international rules and regulations."" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif likened a possible attack to a return to ""the Middle Ages."" Zarif condemned any possible military intervention in Syria on Wednesday, warning of ""graver conditions"" should strikes be carried out. Syria: Chemical weapons -- how did we get here? After last week's attack, new dynamics . The Syrian conflict grew into a full-blown civil war after a fierce government crackdown started on civilian protesters in March 2011. As the crisis worsened, the United States and other Western countries embarked on diplomacy and shunned force to end the crisis, which has left more than 100,000 people dead and millions of civilians displaced, according to the United Nations. But the attack on the outskirts of Damascus last week appeared to have changed the dynamics and put the possibility of force front and center. What justifies intervening if Syria uses chemical weapons? The al-Assad government, Syrian rebels say, used chemical weapons in the attack and killed more than 1,300 people. U.S. President Barack Obama said last year that the movement or use of chemical weaponry in Syria would represent a ""red line"" in the conflict. The United States has deployed warships off the coast of Syria, and Western powers say a strike on Syria could be imminent after reports of a chemical weapons attack that killed hundreds. Along with Iran, Russia has criticized the idea of a strike in Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said there's no proof yet Syria's government is behind last week's chemical attack. The Russia Foreign Ministry accused Washington of trying to ""create artificial groundless excuses for military intervention."" ""The West handles the Islamic world the way a monkey handles a grenade,"" Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said on Twitter. Iran and Syria: Allies for years . Iran's support for Syria has been ""unwavering,"" according to Karim Sadjadpour, who wrote an essay about the relationship for the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. ""Mutual contempt for Saddam Hussein's Iraq brought Syria and Iran together in 1980 and mutual fear and loathing of the United States and Israel has helped sustain their alliance,"" he wrote. He noted that Syria has been Iran's ""only consistent ally since the 1979 Islamic resolution"" and has been a ""geographic thoroughfare"" to Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia -- ""one of the crown jewels of the Iranian revolution."" Iran is the world's most populous Shiite Muslim nation and is led by Shiite religious authorities. The Syrian government is dominated by Alawites, a Shiite offshoot, and the rebels are dominated by Sunnis. ""Iranian motivations in keeping the al-Assad regime in power are also driven by deep concerns about the composition of a post-Assad government. Given Syria's overwhelming Sunni Arab demographic majority, Iran fears the prospect of Syria being rendered a Sunni sectarian regime aligned with Saudi Arabia or the United States and hostile to Shi`a Iran,"" Sadjadpour said. What happens if the regime ""loses Damascus""? Should Iran ""preserve a sphere of influence by supporting a predominantly Alawite militia representing only a small fraction of Syrian society, or to befriend the Sunni rebels poised to wield authority in Damascus?"" ""Contrary to conventional wisdom, what is most important for Iran is not the sectarian composition of Syria's future leaders, but a like-minded ideological worldview premised on resistance to the United States and Israel,"" Sadjadpour wrote.","Iran's supreme leader says ""possible intervention"" would be ""disaster""

"(CNN) -- The woman at the center of the Anthony Weiner scandal is a 23-year-old Indiana native who is passionate about politics and was a strong supporter of the New York politician even after he resigned from Congress amid similar circumstances two years ago, a friend said. Sydney Elaine Leathers actively posts about politics and her Democratic views on Facebook. That's where she met Lou Colagiovanni, a political blogger and writer who moderates a political Facebook page where Leathers frequently posted messages. ""She absolutely idealized this man,"" Colagiovanni told CNN on Wednesday of the respect Leathers had for Weiner, now running for New York mayor. A summer of lies . The gossip website TheDirty.com on Tuesday published a collection of sexual messages and blurred photos exchanged by Weiner and a woman the site did not identify. Weiner admitted later Tuesday that he had engaged in the lewd chats and apologized. Calls poured in for him to withdraw from the race. The website Buzzfeed, in a story Wednesday, was the first to identify Leathers by name as the woman behind the messages. CNN made multiple attempts to reach Leathers for comment without success. But in an interview Thursday with the television program ""Inside Edition,"" Leathers said the former congressman deceived her when he contacted her online. ""I felt manipulated,"" Leathers said. ""Obviously I felt like he's saying one thing to me, another thing to his wife, saying another thing on the campaign trail. I don't know who the real Anthony Weiner is, I guess."" She was astonished that Weiner would revert to the behavior that led to his resignation from Congress in 2011. ""I was shocked because I didn't think he would be so foolish as to do the same thing all over again,"" she said. ""He was making these campaign promises that he had totally changed, and he was a better man now, and he learned from his mistakes, and I have proof that that was not true."" Colagiovanni showed CNN unblurred versions of the same messages and photos released by TheDirty.com that also show Leathers is the woman with whom Weiner was corresponding. Opinion: The public humiliation of Huma Abedin . According to Colagiovanni, Leathers first told him about her online relationship with the former congressman in April, after it had ended. She said the relationship began ""post-scandal"" -- after Weiner resigned from Congress in June 2011 -- and Colagiovanni said the online contact went on for at least eight or nine months, possibly a year. She and Weiner made contact on Twitter and used other platforms to correspond, including Facebook, Formspring and e-mail, Colagiovanni said. Weiner's e-mail address contained the phrase ""CarlosDanger3333,"" Colagiovanni said. ""She initially contacted him through Twitter,"" he said. ""She said that she was a fan.... I assume that based on how beautiful of a young lady that Sydney is, Anthony Weiner had no choice but to act on his instincts and go after any pretty young woman who gives him the time of day. ""She thought he was a righteous fighter for the middle class,"" he added. Leathers is a political liberal and very passionate about women's issues, even going to Texas to attend a rally for Wendy Davis, the Democrat state senator who recently filibustered an abortion bill. Chat logs show that Weiner offered Leathers a condo in Chicago, Colagiovanni said. ""She had mentioned to me that he promised her a condo,"" Colagiovanni said. ""He offered to help her move so there was certainly conversations about that."" Colagiovanni said he doesn't know whether Leathers and Weiner actually met. ""There was tawdry phone sex that went on between these two for months on end,"" Colagiovanni told CNN. ""She had told me that she sent him numerous naked pictures."" Colagiovanni gave CNN a copy of the Facebook conversations he had with Leathers in which she described the relationship. He also shared lewd e-mails that Leathers forwarded from Weiner, written under his alias, Carlos Danger. Leathers told Colagiovanni in their Facebook conversations that she and the congressman had phone sex, texted, e-mailed and sent each other nude pictures of themselves. Should Weiner's wife stand by her man? ""We talked ALL the time,"" Leathers wrote to Colagiovanni. ""He even called in August, knowing I was on a train to Chicago, just to tell me about a sex dream he had about me. He did that kind of thing a lot. He was also obsessed with me wearing heels lol."" But by April of this year, things had turned sour, and Leathers felt let down and disappointed by the man she once held in high regard, Colagiovanni said. ""Sydney loved him but then she fell out of love with him because the idealized vision in which she had of him was not true, was not the case,"" he told CNN. ""She became disgusted with him after finding out that the person who she thought she was in love with was not indeed that person."" Pastor: Weiner is an addict . Colagiovanni, who said he has been involved in dozens of political campaigns around the country and works as a media consultant, said he and Leathers discussed selling the story. He told her she could use it as a ""springboard for national attention to ride on to fame and fortune."" ""I hope we make some $ out of it,"" she wrote. ""There is not a doubt in my mind that we won't makes (sic) thousands and thousands of dollars,"" he replied. Though it was CNN that contacted Colagiovanni, he said he wanted to share Leathers' messages to him and her correspondence with Weiner because he felt betrayed by her. Opinion: Will 'sexting' city give Weiner a pass? ""I feel this was my story,"" he said. ""I had cultivated this story. I sat on it for months. I was reluctant to release it because Sydney told me, 'Listen, I don't want this story to go out, I don't want anybody to know about it.'"" He said he asked her about 10 days ago what she was doing with the story, and she still told Colagiovanni she didn't want anyone to know about it. ""And then as everybody saw on TheDirty.com, the story did come out, so she misled me in her ideas of what she wanted to have happen here,"" Colagiovanni said. ""So why I'm talking to you now is, I want my story to get out there."" He is hoping to sell his story somehow. ""I'm not going to lie: I have bills to pay,"" he said. ""Everybody does."" Weiner wouldn't be in race without his wife . CNN's, Randi Kaye and Gabrielle Rodman contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I felt manipulated,"" Leathers tells ""Inside Edition"" about Weiner .

"(CNN) -- The 43-year-old gunman who set fire to his apartment in suburban Miami and then fatally shot six people in and around the building had given authorities no reason to believe anything was amiss until Friday night, police said Saturday. ""Nobody seems to know why he acted the way he acted,"" Hialeah Police Department Spokesman Carl Zogby told reporters about Pedro Vargas. Police were looking into the possibility that Vargas -- described by some as a ""quiet"" man -- may have had a dispute with the building managers, who were among his victims, Zogby said. But that had not been established. An initial check indicated that Vargas had no criminal history and no history of irrational behavior. ""We don't have an explanation,"" Zogby said. The incident began around 6:30 p.m. Friday, when callers to 911 reported that smoke was emanating from Apartment 408, which Vargas had recently rented and where he was living with his mother, Zogby said. The Hialeah police spokesman said Vargas used a flammable liquid to spread the fire. As the two building managers -- Italo and Camira Pisciotti -- ran toward the smoking apartment, Vargas exited the apartment and shot them both several times, killing them, Zogby said. Vargas returned to his apartment balcony, shooting 10 to 20 times into the street. Carlos Javier Gavilanes, 33, was returning home from work when he was struck in a parking lot across the street, Zogby said. He identified the victim as a father. Vargas then ran down to the third floor, kicked the door open of an apartment and fatally shot Patricio Simono, 69, and Merly S. Niebles, 51, and their 17-year-old daughter, whose name was being withheld, Zogby said. ""Vargas then ran out of the apartment, ran throughout the building firing shots at random in a very irrational fashion,"" Zogby said. By now, firefighters had arrived at the approximately 90-unit building but were unable to enter the burning apartment because of the gunfire, Zogby said. Hialeah police -- aided by officers from nearby police agencies -- responded in droves, with more than 100 at the building, he said. ""Our main objective at that point was to neutralize an active shooter,"" he said. ""He fired at us and we fired at him."" After eluding police for about three hours, Vargas entered another apartment, where he holed himself up with two hostages and began negotiating with police, Zogby said. But when the negotiations failed after about three hours, ""the SWAT unit made the decision to enter and neutralize -- and shoot -- Mr. Vargas,"" Zogby said. ""When they entered the apartment, he resisted, he fired at them. There was an exchange of gunfire, he was ready to fight."" The officers returned the fire, and Vargas died on the scene early Saturday, Zogby said. The hostages were ""shaken up,"" but not hurt. Police found a 9 mm pistol and ""plenty of ammo,"" Zogby said. The fire never spread beyond the Vargas apartment.","Police investigate possible motive .

"(CNN) -- A number of sectarian attacks occurred Saturday in Iraq, killing dozens and wounding many more. In northeastern Baghdad, 20 people were killed and 55 others were wounded in a suicide attack that targeted Shiite pilgrims, police said. The bomber, wearing an explosive vest, detonated among Shiite pilgrims near the al-Amma bridge in the Sunni al-Adhamiya neighborhood. The victims were among thousands of Shiite pilgrims heading to the al-Kadhimiya neighborhood of northwestern Baghdad to commemorate the death of Mohammed al-Jawad, the ninth of the 12 imams in Shiism. In a separate incident in the town of Balad in the north, at least 12 people were killed and 32 others were wounded when a car bomb exploded Saturday evening outside a coffee shop, police said. The town, which is predominantly Shiite, is located in Salaheddin province some 56 miles (90 km) north of Baghdad and has been the site of previous violence. In August 2012, at least 12 people were killed and 45 others were wounded when a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest blew himself up inside a coffee shop, police said then. It was not clear whether Saturday's attack occurred at the same coffee shop. In the al-Baya neighborhood of southwestern Baghdad, a makeshift bomb exploded Saturday evening inside a coffee shop, killing two people and wounding 10 others, Baghdad police told CNN. The area is largely Shia. On Saturday morning, gunmen fatally shot a television reporter and a cameraman who were working for al-Sharqiya, a private, pro-Sunni television station that is often critical of the Shiite-led government. The incident occurred in central Mosul in northern Iraq, police said. Also Saturday, at least two Iraqi security forces were killed and three others were wounded when gunmen attacked a security checkpoint south of Falluja, a predominantly Sunni city about 60 km (38 miles) west of Baghdad in Anbar province, police in Ramadi told CNN.","A suicide bomber targets Shiite pilgrims in northeastern Baghdad, killing 20 .

"(CNN) -- The events unfolding off the coast of Lampedusa are both tragic and shocking. More than a hundred people are confirmed dead and the death toll is almost certain to rise dramatically. Although it may be awful, sadly this is neither an unusual nor unfamiliar story. According to the UNHCR, in 2012, some 15,000 migrants and asylum-seekers reached Italy and Malta and almost 500 people were reported dead or missing at sea. The figures are damning and shameful. Too many people are dying in their attempts to reach safety in Europe and much more needs to be done to address the root causes of why people risk their lives in this way. One thing is clear -- this latest incident is an appalling reminder of what happens when people escaping persecution are denied access to safety at the EU's frontiers. While we don't know the personal circumstances of everyone on board this particular boat, we do know that the majority were from Somalia and Eritrea, two of the top 10 sources of refugees in the world, according to the UNHCR. Both are countries with well documented human rights abuses. Given this, it's reasonable to believe that a number of people on board were refugees, fleeing persecution and seeking safety in Europe where there are substantial and settled Somali and Eritrean communities. Yet there's been considerable head scratching in the media about why people would put themselves at such risk. Why would you get on an overcrowded, potentially unseaworthy vessel and risk your life to make it to Lampedusa? For refugees, the answer is simple -- what they're leaving behind is much, much worse. Somalia and Eritrea's human rights abuses are well documented. Sexual violence and torture are commonplace. For refugees, staying at home -- or 'going back to where they came from' -- is not an option. Difficult though it may be for us to comprehend, for refugees, paying smugglers and boarding these boats is a rational decision. The problem is compounded by the lack of safe, legal routes into Europe. The Refugee Convention -- a legal framework which defines who refugees are, their rights and the legal obligations of countries -- recognizes that people fleeing for their lives may have to resort to illegal entry. This drives refugees to take even greater risks to escape. European countries have a legal obligation to provide protection under the Refugee Convention but during the last decade the continent's borders have become heavily securitized, with millions of pounds invested in Frontex, the agency established by the EU to strengthen Europe's borders and protect the continent against unwanted illegal migrants. These measures should not apply to individuals escaping war and persecution -- the theoretical beneficiaries of legally sanctioned protection and compassion -- but refugees are often forced to resort to the same irregular channels to leave their country of origin and travel towards safety. Europe's formidable migration control apparatus does not sufficiently differentiate between individuals who may be in need of international protection and other migrants. In the absence of safe, legal ways to reach European territories, refugees are forced into dangerous and abusive situations, and often obliged to embrace the perils of life-threatening journeys and the unscrupulous services of smugglers. Boarding an overcrowded boat bound for Italy would possibly have been the last stage in a long and dangerous journey for many of those on that voyage. Some of them possibly didn't even know where they were headed. European governments must work in solidarity to ensure people fleeing human rights violations and persecution are given entry. When people are in need of our help, we must live up to our international obligations and offer it. Only then can we be sure we are doing all we can to prevent more deaths. We must keep a door to safety open for refugees and develop ways of identifying those with protection needs among the broader flow of migrants. As yesterday's events have shown, it's a matter of life and death.

"(CNN) -- Kim Kardashian's weekend visit to promote milkshakes in Bahrain drew a large crowd of excited fans, but the promoter who brought the Hollywood reality star to the island Gulf state denied a report of protesters being tear-gassed by police. Kardashian, 32, stopped in Bahrain Saturday as part of a Middle Eastern promotional tour for Millions of Milkshakes, a franchise created and owned by businessman Sheeraz Hasan. ""WHAT PROTESTS?? Kim Kardashian loved by the people of Bahrain & wants to return!!"" Hasan said in a Twitter posting Sunday. CNN has been unable to independently confirm the reports, all of which are ultimately attributed to an unidentified ""local newspaper,"" that police used tear-gas grenades to disperse 100 Shiite Muslim protesters with anti-Kardashian signs before her arrival at a high-end shopping complex in Riffa, Bahrain. Read more: Kim Kardashian shakes Bahrain . Kardashian, whose reps did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment Sunday, did tweet about her visit Saturday, not addressing the protest report: ""Thanks @sheerazhasan and Paresh A Shah for an amazing trip to The Kingdom of Bahrain and Kuwait. We did it!!!"" Kardashian, who initially gained notoriety when a sex tape with singer Ray J. Norwood leaked in 2007, told fans gathered in the mall. ""It's so beautiful here, the people are so amazing."" Shiites are two-thirds of Bahrain's population, but it is ruled by a Sunni royal family. The split between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, the two major denominations of the Islamic faith, dates back to the 7th century when the two sects were divided over who should lead the nascent religion following the Prophet Mohammed's death. Shiite Muslims believed a direct descendent of the prophet should lead, while Sunnis believed there was no rightful successor and that one should be selected by followers. The schism culminated in a war that forever split the sects. Shiite groups have conducted public protests demanding greater economic opportunities, including jobs, housing and political rights. ""Protests stem from a population who feel they are being treated as second-class citizens, not because they have different interpretations of the Quran,"" said Jane Kinninmont, senior research fellow at British think tank Chatham House, in a CNN interview last year.

"(CNN) -- The tragic death of Moritz Erhardt, a 21-year-old intern at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, has cast a spotlight on the extreme work culture in the financial industry. The hours that Erhardt had been working are not unusual. Many finance professionals often work into the wee hours of the morning. Their weekends are spent recovering from grueling workweeks. Their holidays are spent constantly checking in with the office. The result is that work begins to take up nearly every waking hour. There is little time left for life. The extreme work culture used to be the preserve of a few elite professions, such as banking or law. Now it seems to be spreading. Employees in many jobs are being asked to make themselves constantly available. Partly, it's because new technologies allow people to be connected and reachable at all times. But it comes at a huge cost. There is a significant body of research that shows long working hours have negative physical and psychological effects on people. A recent study by professor Alexandra Michel tracked investment bankers over a nine-year period. These bankers would routinely work from early morning to well past midnight. To cope with these hours, many became gym junkies, taking to the treadmill after midnight for an hourlong run. However, after about seven years of this relentless grind, the bankers began to suffer serious psychological and physical breakdowns. In addition to damaging the body and mind, long hours at work cut people off from their family and friends. People who spend most of their waking hours at work or dealing with work-related activities have little time to build and nurture relationships outside of work. Their intimate relationships with family can become strained. Their friendships can become weak. If something goes wrong, they may feel isolated and helpless because they lack a healthy ecosystem for emotional support. The result is that their social network withers and, over time, can die. Extreme hours have been proven to be unhealthy for workers. They are also bad for communities. If days are spent only working, then there is little time to put into local clubs, faith groups and associations. Harvard professor Robert Putnam has pointed out that the long working hour culture has led to a stunning decline in the numbers of people who are members of clubs and associations. It has effectively weakened the fabric of our communities. People are increasingly cut off, to the extent that it's common not to know your neighbors or anyone in your neighborhood. What is perhaps most surprising is that long hours are not even good for companies. The most productive countries among the developed economies often have the shortest work hours. Employees in Germany and France work less hours but get more done. Their British counterparts spend much longer at work but produce far less. Not only that, when people are tired from long hours, they tend to make more irrational and risky decisions. A recent study by the Swedish sociologist Roland Paulsen has shown that long hours at work also lead to the prevalence of unproductive ""empty work"" such as checking Facebook, watching YouTube videos or even undertaking personal projects at the office. It's possible that these are ways for employees to show resistance. There are so many good reasons to end the extreme work culture. But how can it be done? A first step is for companies to introduce policies and practices that stop employees from working through the night. These might include having work-life balance programs, or closing the doors to the office at a reasonable hour or banning e-mail traffic after a particular time at night. As important as these top-down changes are, employees need to instigate bottom-up changes. These require us to avoid modeling and encouraging the practice of working long hours among new recruits. We have to make it acceptable to say ""no"" to an extreme work culture. Remember, we work to live, not live to work. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andre Spicer.","Andre Spicer: Intern's death casts spotlight on extreme work culture in finance industry .

"(CNN) -- A former Microsoft executive and his son were aboard a turboprop airline that crashed Friday morning into two houses in East Haven, Connecticut, a family member told CNN. There has been ""no official confirmation or positive identification"" that Bill Henningsgaard and his son were on board, but there is no reason to believe that it was not the two of them, his brother, Blair Henningsgaard, said. Also feared dead in the crash were two children -- ages 1 and 13 -- in one house, East Haven Mayor Joseph Maturo Jr. said. The other house was unoccupied. National Transportation Safety Board investigators cannot confirm the number of people killed, saying there are reports of four to six people dead. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said there could be as many as five people killed in the crash, including up to three people on the plane. But Blair Henningsgaard said only his brother and his nephew were believed to be on the plane. Two bodies were seen inside the home but haven't been recovered because the home is unstable, East Haven Fire Chief Douglas Jackson said at a press conference Friday afternoon. Fire consumed both houses, preventing firefighters from searching for victims, Jackson said, and the basement in the home holding at least two victims was filled with water. Maturo said the children were in one house with their mother when the plane struck shortly before 11:30 a.m. The mother escaped, he said. ""It's ... total devastation in the back of the home,"" Maturo said. The multi-engine Rockwell International Turbo Commander 690B, registered to Bill Henningsgaard, took off from New Jersey's Teterboro Airport on Friday morning and crashed while approaching the Tweed New Haven Airport around 11:25 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said. The plane missed its initial approach, which isn't uncommon, said Tweed airport manager Lori Hoffman-Soares. But NTSB investigator Robert Gretz told reporters it was possible the plane was on its first approach. The neighborhood is about a half mile from the airport. One resident said the accident wasn't surprising. ""They fly in very low, and a lot of times you can hear the engine cut off before it gets to the runway,"" she told CNN affiliate WTIC. The mayor said the airport's close proximity to residents isn't unusual. ""It's always a concern, but it's something that happens in every airport,"" Maturo said. Neither the pilot's identity nor information about how many people were in the plane was immediately available. The fuselage entered one of the homes, Malloy said. The right wing of the airplane could be seen in the smoldering wreckage of one house, and the left wing was in another house. Video from affiliate WTNH showed smoke rising from a heavily damaged house in East Haven, and what appeared to be the tail of a plane nearby. NTSB investigators will examine whether the weather played a role in the crash. It was raining at the time of the crash. Bill Henningsgaard worked for Microsoft for 14 years, beginning in 1988. He served as vice president of sales for the western United States, Australia and New Zealand. CNN's Jason Hanna, Chelsea J. Carter, Kevin Conlon and Cristy Lenz contributed to this report.","NEW: Between four and six people are believed dead, NTSB says .

"Washington (CNN) -- In a critical indication of growing U.S. military involvement in the civil war in Syria, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered the deployment of more American troops to Jordan. Hagel announced the deployment, which was first reported on CNN, in a statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. He said the troops will work alongside Jordanian forces to ""improve readiness and prepare for a number of scenarios."" The troops, which will number up to 200, are from the headquarters of the 1st Armored Division at Fort Bliss, Texas, two Defense Department officials told CNN. The deployment ""creates an additional capability"" beyond what has been there, one official said, and will give the United States the ability to ""potentially form a joint task force for military operations, if ordered."" The new deployment will include communications and intelligence specialists who will assist the Jordanians and ""be ready for military action"" if President Barack Obama were to order it, the official said. There have been several dozen American troops, mainly special forces, in Jordan for the past year assisting the Jordanians. But that group has been very ad hoc, the official said. This new deployment makes the U.S. military presence more official and is the first formalized ongoing presence of an American military unit in the Kingdom in recent years. This comes as the Pentagon has recently reviewed military options for Syria although Obama has not ordered any to be put into action. Hagel cautioned lawmakers about the difficulties surrounding any direct U.S. military action in Syria. ""It could embroil the United States in a significant, lengthy, and uncertain military commitment,"" he said. He called military intervention ""an option, but an option of last resort."" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said the United States could send troops to Syria if the regime of President Bashar al-Assad fell to rebels, if needed, to secure the country's chemical weapons cache. But when asked if he was confident the United States could secure them, Dempsey said, ""Not as I sit here today simply because they have been moving it, and the number of sites is quite numerous.""","Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel orders up to 200 troops to Jordan .

"(CNN) -- Strange things happened in a small courtroom in the Russian city of Kirov last week. Moscow mayoral candidate, and my colleague in the Russian opposition, Alexei Navalny, was convicted July 18 on concocted embezzlement charges in the type of political show trial that Josef Stalin favored long before his spiritual successor President Vladimir Putin embraced them. Then, the very next morning, the same prosecutor asked for Navalny's release pending his appeal. It was a move so unexpected that an incredulous Navalny asked the court to make sure the prosecutor had not been swapped for an identical twin overnight. That something surprising happened in a Russian courtroom is itself surprising. As with our so-called elections, important trial outcomes are decided well in advance and with little need for evidence. (When the Kirov judge went to his chambers to deliberate over Navalny's release, one wit tweeted ""the Skype connection to Moscow must be particularly slow today."") The judicial process and the democratic process in Russia are both elaborate mockeries created to distract the citizenry at home and to help Western leaders avoid confronting the awkward fact that Russia has returned to a police state while they stood by or, in many cases, while they eagerly did business with the repressive Putin regime. That this strange occurrence happened to the most prominent member of the anti-Putin opposition movement is therefore shocking and meaningful. In Putin's Russia, political dissidents simply do not get out of jail. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia's wealthiest man, has been imprisoned since his October 2003 arrest for the ""crime"" of disloyalty to Putin. Everyone knows his jail term is exactly as long as Putin's stay in power, no shorter and no longer. It is no coincidence that Navalny's sentence will leave him in prison safely beyond the 2018 presidential elections. The motivations for Navalny's brief respite are unclear, and will likely always remain so, but it likely reflects factional infighting inside the Kremlin. Putin's main allies, the security and intelligence forces known as the siloviki, advocate ever-greater repression. They want to jail every opposition leader and activist and prevent any legitimate expression of democracy. Former Putin classmate Alexander Bastrykin is the leader and symbol of the siloviki camp. As former top prosecutor and current chief of the powerful Investigative Committee, Bastrykin is the administration's main weapon against political and social resistance. Apparently Bastrykin is not all powerful, however, and Navalny's hurried release counts as a defeat for his authority. But it is not clear for whom it was a victory. Navalny is running for mayor in Moscow in what was expected at the start to be another electoral charade. But incumbent mayor Sergey Sobyanin -- worried about a repeat of the 2011 protests against the blatantly fraudulent parliamentary elections which brought hundreds of thousands onto the streets, actually helped Navalny get on the ballot. It is likely Sobyanin and those in the Kremlin sympathetic to his position on social unrest were behind Navalny's release. Sobyanin craves the legitimacy of retaining his prestigious position as the mayor of Moscow in a relatively fair contest against Navalny. He believes this would position him as a leading contender to succeed Putin when the dictator inevitably falls. Sobyanin is hardly a democrat, but his selfish interests may work to bring democracy back to Russia. Conjecture aside, Navalny's quick release was either incompetence or high-level internal sabotage -- and neither possibility is good news for Putin. The siloviki live in a pseudo-Soviet bubble, working to keep the lid of repression down as tightly as possible for as long as possible. But others, including Sobyanin, look ahead and realize that taking this path will make the eventual explosion of opposition even stronger. Some of them are ambitious enough to chafe at Putin's obvious intent to hold power for life. They are far from liberal reformers, of course, and are seeking to advance their own interests. But at the moment those interests are leading them to undermine Putin's iron grip on every lever of power. This matters, because the policeman on the Moscow street gets his strength from the knowledge that his superiors will support him unconditionally. He can crack open a protester's skull knowing his captain will defend his action. The captain knows the colonel will defend him because the general will protect him, the judges will protect them, and so on all the way up to the plushest chair in Putin's office. This unbroken chain is critical and a public weakening of the links at the top means Red Square moves a bit closer to Tahrir Square. The protests that erupted after Navalny's conviction were the largest unsanctioned rallies since 2011 and the police let them happen nearly without incident. (The prosecution's request to release Navalny was made immediately after the verdict was read.) There is doubt in the ranks because they sense doubt at the top. If Navalny is set free, wonders the police captain, should he give the order to beat those protesters demonstrating in his name? This may be only a brief moment of hesitation, but it is real. Cracks are appearing in the fa√É¬ßade elsewhere as well. Mikhail Prokhorov, the oligarch who pretended to be an opposition candidate in last year's presidential election without saying a word against Putin, is now openly supporting Yaroslavl mayor Yevgeny Urlashov after he was arrested on bribery charges. (Kremlin partners do not suffer such indignities.) Another Prokhorov ally, Yevgeny Roizman, is running for the mayoralty of Russia's third-largest city, Yekaterinburg. The most popular slogans during last week's spontaneous rallies were ""Svoboda!"" (""Freedom!"") and ""Putin vor!"" (""Putin's a thief!"") The situation looks increasingly unbalanced. A new wave of mass protests could force the Putin regime to find out how loyal its security forces really are. Navalny is still convicted and he may be allowed to run for mayor only to attempt to discredit him before jailing him. If he gains too much support he can be locked up at any time, or worse, as he well knows, although this would create just the sort of scandal Sobyanin would like to avoid in his quest to appear to be a legitimately elected official. But the election might not be as easy as they think. In last year's presidential election Putin received 47% of the vote in Moscow -- and those are the official numbers, not real ones -- despite epic fraud and despite facing no real opposition. Can Sobyanin then be expected to surpass the 50% needed to avoid a second ballot without resorting to the same tactics that spawned outrage in 2011? Navalny is a real fighter and he has thousands of enthusiastic volunteers to campaign for him and to closely observe the election process on September 8. There are only bad choices for the Kremlin at this point. Their fear of Navalny and the movement he represents is provoking conflict and confusion. In the movie ""Groundhog Day"", Bill Murray's character wakes up in Andie MacDowell's arms after an eternity of repeating the same day over and over. ""Something is... different,"" he says. ""Good or bad?"" she asks. ""Anything different is good,"" he answers. Something different happened in Kirov last week and my optimism tells me it was a positive sign. After more than 13 years of predictable repression under Putin, anything different is good. We should not let avid speculation distract us from the cruel reality of Navalny's situation -- and of Putin's Russia. The lives of opposition members and journalists are worth very little. A man will spend five years in a labor camp for nothing more than speaking openly his opposition to Vladimir Putin. Navalny's former colleague, Pyotr Ofitserov, refused to testify against him and got a four-year sentence. He has five young children. And for every case you hear about, there are dozens of others forming this new generation of political prisoners under Putin. The big picture is important, but we lose our humanity if we lose sight of the real people whose stories make up that picture. Success for Navalny's campaign in Moscow, any demonstration that he has substantial popular support, would change the atmosphere of the country and give these prisoners hope. And it would give us all hope that real change is on the way.","Important trial outcomes are decided well in advance and with little need for evidence, writes Garry Kasparov .

"(CNN)  -- Expecting moms can determine whether they're carrying a boy or a girl as early as 10 weeks after conception, according to makers of an over-the-counter gender prediction test. With IntelliGender's home gender prediction test, a urine specimen turns orange if it's a girl. Green is for boys. IntelliGender, the  Plano, Texas, creator of the ""Boy or Girl Gender Prediction Test,"" says scientists isolated certain hormones that when combined with a ""proprietary mix of chemicals"" react differently if a woman is carrying a boy or a girl. It claims that within 10 minutes of taking the urine test, a woman will be able to tell her baby's gender. The specimen will turn green if it's a boy, and orange if it's a girl. IntelliGender would not say what hormones or chemicals it uses it in its test because of a pending patent. ""Most parents have a great degree of curiosity to find out if they're having a boy or a girl, and it can be so excruciating to wait until the 20-week sonogram to find out,"" IntelliGender co-founder Rebecca Griffin said. ""But the test was never meant to be a diagnostic tool. We don't claim 100 percent accuracy.""  Watch more on the at-home test ¬ª . In fact, the company's Web site specifically says to not ""paint the room pink or blue"" until an expectant mom confirms results with her doctor. ""We specifically state to all our consumers that they shouldn't make any emotional or financial steps until the results are confirmed via sonogram,"" the company says. The gender predictor test boasts a 78 to 80 percent accuracy rate, according to the latest IntelliGender report. So why are soon-to-be parent be so eager to find out whether their ""Sammy"" is really a ""Suzy"" a few months early? ""When a parent can visualize the sex of their baby and confirm they have that little person inside of them, it suddenly becomes real to them,"" said Jennifer Parks, co-director of Loyola University Chicago's Programs in Health Care Ethics. ""They often feel a stronger connection. So, it's not surprising parents would want this test."" But some say the issue could get dicey if the test findings led to  a decision about whether to carry on with the pregnancy. ""Say a woman has three daughters and wants to get pregnant one last time to have a baby boy. If she takes the test at 10 weeks, and it's not the sex she wants, she may want to terminate and try again,"" Parks said. ""Not everyone in America is rabidly pro-choice, or rapidly pro-life; a lot of Americans kind of hang out right in the middle,"" she added. ""At 10 weeks, most Americans see it as the earliest embryo, very different than a more developed fetus."" The makers of the gender prediction test say they ""categorically disagree"" with the idea their test may prompt an increase in sex-selection abortions. ""I can't even fathom someone making a decision about whether to terminate a pregnancy based on a test informing them they may have a boy or a girl,"" Griffin said. IntelliGender says out of ""hundreds of thousands"" of e-mail inquiries, only two have inquired about using the test as a vehicle for sex-selection. Anti-abortion groups, already concerned about women opting to keep babies based on hair and eye color, are now worried about gender-selection, too. ""There's a problem that's very prevalent in some countries where boy babies are greatly preferred for cultural reasons and aborting girl babies is very common,"" said Anthony Lauinger, vice president of National Right to Life. While the test is available for sale in 11 countries, IntelliGender does not sell the test to India or China. ""All of our retailers have to strictly adhere to that policy. If they don't, we would pull our product immediately from their shelves,"" Griffin said. Since 2006, more than 50,000 tests have sold online in the United States. Last month, U.S. drugstore chains CVS and Walgreens, began selling the gender predictor test for $34.95.","Just 10 weeks after conception, women can take at-home test to predict gender .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Hundreds of police are involved in the hunt for a 63-year-old man in connection with the murder of five people in a remote Japanese hamlet. The victims' houses were also burned down. A note, apparently written in the form of a ""haiku"" poem -- a typically short form of Japanese verse -- was left hanging in the window of the fugitive man's home next door to one of the burned out homes. Three bodies were found on Sunday after two houses in Mitake, a tiny community in western Japan's Yamaguchi prefecture, were gutted by a ""suspicious"" fire, Yamaguchi police spokesman Katsumi Harada told CNN. The following morning, two more corpses were found a few hundred meters away in the same neighborhood in the victims' respective homes. An autopsy revealed that all five victims were killed by injuries to the head, prompting police to set up a task force to investigate a possible serial killer, Harada said. Despite feverish media speculation, Harada refused to draw a link between the poem and the killings, though he said the man, who's been missing since Sunday, could provide valuable information about what happened. According to the authorities, the poem translated as: ""Setting on fire, smoke gives delight, to country fellows."" Mitake is a remote, mountainous hamlet with only 16 inhabitants. According to local media, the man police are hunting lived alone and moved into the neighborhood about 20 years ago to take care of his elderly parents. Reports suggested the man grew increasingly alienated in the small community after his parents died about 7-8 years ago. One of the victims frequently quarreled with him over his dog, according to Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper.","Five bodies discovered in remote village in Western Japan; their house burned down .

"(CNN) -- Its winds no longer a major threat, a stalled Tropical Storm Karen still carried the threat of storm surge to portions of the U.S. Gulf Coast. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) said the storm's maximum sustained winds were at 40 mph on Saturday evening. The storm was idle much of Saturday night, but forecasters predicted it would turn northeast and gain speed going into Sunday, when it was expected to weaken to a tropical depression. The center of the storm will move just south of the Gulf Coast from Alabama to the Florida Panhandle on Sunday night and Monday, the NHC predicted. The storm will dissipate into a remnant area of low pressure on Sunday evening, with no secondary landfall along the northern Gulf Coast, forecasters said. A tropical storm warning was in effect for Grand Isle, Louisiana, to the mouth of the Pearl River. Coastal residents were warned that storm surges and dangerous waves remained possible. The storm is expected to drop up to 3 inches of rain over parts of the central and eastern Gulf Coast through Sunday night, mainly near and to the east of the storm's center, the hurricane center said. Storm surges also are a concern. If peak surges coincide with high tide, water could reach up to 3 feet above ground from the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana to Alabama's Mobile Bay, the center said. ""The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters,"" the center said. CNN's Sean Morris, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Todd Borek and David Simpson contributed to this report.","Tropical Storm Karen has sustained winds of 40 mph .

"(CNN) -- The Super Bowl XX champions Chicago Bears -- regarded as one of the most colorful teams in NFL history with players nicknamed ""The Fridge,"" ""Da Coach,"" ""Sweetness,"" and a punk quarterback -- has been invited to the White House next month to make up for a visit that was canceled 25 years ago, a White House official told CNN Thursday. As it turns out, President Barack Obama, who is from Chicago's South Side, happens to be a big Bears fan. The team will visit Washington on October 7, the official said. The Bears' initial post-Super Bowl visit to the White House was canceled because the space shuttle Challenger exploded just two days after the January 1986 victory. The nation went into mourning over the seven-member crew's deaths. The Bears posted a 15-1 record that season and are regarded as one of the most dominant teams to win the Super Bowl. What endeared the team to many fans, however, were the team's colorful personalities -- perhaps too colorful because the Bears never became the dynasty that many had expected. An attendee list wasn't immediately available, but the 1985 team roster included such prominent members as coach Mike Ditka, whose Midwest provincialism inspired a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit with catchphrases such as ""Dit-Ka"" and ""Da Bears"" delivered in ice-hard Chicago accents; Jim McMahon, often dubbed the ""punk quarterback;"" the 350-pound-plus lineman William ""The Fridge"" Perry; and erstwhile all-time NFL rushing leader Walter ""Sweetness"" Payton, who died of cancer in 1999. Considered a die-hard Bears fan, the president said it was difficult to host the Green Bay Packers at the White House in August to celebrate their Super Bowl victory last February. Bears vs. Packers is one of the NFL's most intense rivalries. Both play in the NFC North, nicknamed the league's bruising ""Black and Blue"" division. ""This hurts a little bit. This is a hard thing for a Bears fan to do. It doesn't hurt as much as the NFC Championship game hurt -- but it still hurts -- you guys coming to my house to rub it in,"" Obama joked while honoring the Packers in August. ""What are you going to do, go to Ditka's house next?"" The Bears lost to Green Bay in the NFC Championship game last season, and the Packers advanced to the Super Bowl.","The Super Bowl XX champs Bears will visit the White House on October 7 .
Oh, by the way, President Obama is a Bears fan .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- On the face of it, women in China seem to have cracked the code for success. Seven of world's top 10 wealthiest self-made women are Chinese. Property tycoon Zhang Xin is richer than Oprah. And a girl-power chick flick called ""Tiny Times"" broke the mainland's opening-day box office record earlier this summer. But don't let the headlines fool you. In China, as in many other corners of the world, women are under pressure, under-represented, and under threat. A preference for boys under China's one-child policy continues to this day. Access to cheap ultrasound and and abortions has led to widespread selective abortion of female fetuses. According to the China Statistics Bureau, there are now 34 million more men than women in China. OPINION: China's biggest problem? Too many men . Marital property in China belongs to the one person who owns the home -- who is, more often than not, a man. And there's not a single woman on the ruling Communist Party's seven-member Politburo Standing Committee. ""So when it comes to women's issues, who will speak for women?"" asks former legislator and committed feminist Wu Qing. For CNN's ""On China,"" I talked to Wu and two high-profile observers of women's issues in China -- Tsinghua University scholar Leta Hong Fincher and bestselling author Joy Chen -- on the state of gender inequality in China. Wu squarely blames the government for not trying hard enough to shore up women's rights by implementing the constitution. ""Article 33 says every single citizen of the People's Republic of China should be treated equally,"" Wu points out. ""And, according to Article 48 on women, women should enjoy equal rights in the economy, in politics, in everything."" ""And yet, China is still rule of man, by man."" OPINION: What Chinese women want . Beijing is not only failing to represent the needs of women. It's putting its own interests ahead of China's increasingly educated and single female population. According to Hong Fincher, there has been an active state media campaign to promote the term ""leftover women,"" a derogatory term referring to spoiled food that's been used to shame China's urban educated women over the age of 27 who are still single. The term was defined by the All China's Women's Federation in 2007. ""After the Women's Federation defined this term, then the state media started aggressively pushing it,"" Hong Fincher tells me. ""There's been a stream of reports insulting educated women in their late 20s who don't have a husband yet."" ""It's insulting not just to single women,"" says Joy Chen. ""It's insulting to all women and all men because it basically says you're legitimate to the extent that you're married."" ""And the leftover label is everywhere in society,"" Chen adds. ""Your plumber tells you to hurry and get married if you're a single woman with an apartment."" OPINION: Single Chinese women say 'I won't' Hong Fincher argues that the term is part of a government program to upgrade population quality: ""So what they want to do is promote match -making to encourage or scare educated women into having a child because that fits the government's demographic goals."" Despite all the social pressure and lack of government support, there are the outliers among Chinese women -- extreme examples of extraordinary success. So what pushed them to go so far? ""These women who are multi-millionaires have made it in spite of being in China, not because of it,"" says Hong Fincher. ""I wish that those women would speak out more on behalf of women all across China."" Wu herself is an outlier among China's women. A former university professor and a member of the Haidian district's People's Congress for 27 years, she is a tireless activist. And she is speaking out on behalf of China's women as a women's rights advocate and a founder of a school to empower rural women. ""We need to have a very clear goal in our lives, know what we want,"" Wu tells me. ""I was lucky that when I was a little girl, my mom told me that I'm a human being first before I'm a girl or a woman."" To crack the code for success, don't say you're a woman first.","Chinese women may feature on rich lists but many take second place to men .
Young women are under pressure to marry lest be labeled ""leftover women""
Marital property belongs to one person, typically the man of the household .
Preference for boys continues due to China's one-child policy ."
"(CNN) -- Next time you host a soiree, you can collect photos of the event from your guests in one album on Facebook. The social network has added shared photo albums so people can throw photos from an event or of a common subject into a single spot. The new shared album feature, first reported by Mashable, is rolling out to English-speaking users of the social network but will eventually be available around the world. When you create a new photo album, there will be a new button that says ""Make Shared Album."" Click and add up to 50 other people you want contributing to the album. Each person can upload 200 photos for a maximum of 10,000 images in a single shared album. Every contributor can tag, edit and give captions to the photos they add. The album's creator can decide who sees the photos by setting the privacy settings to just contributors, friends of contributors or public. You can only add individual contributors. There's no option to open an album to your entire network or base one on a specific shared gathering such as a concert or sporting event. You can open up the floodgates a bit by allowing your friends to add anyone else they like to an album. ""Hundreds of millions of photos are uploaded onto Facebook each day and today, we're making it even easier for friends to share photos with the rollout of Shared Photo Albums,"" the company said in a statement . Creating a single bucket for all the photos from an event is going to be a hit with wedding or other party guests, though the 50-person limit could be tricky if you throw proper ragers. The 68,000 people returning from the Burning Man festival next week can share their dusty photos memories in groups on Facebook instead of each posting them individually. A family vacation to Disney World can be immortalized in one spot. Birthday party guests can share their photos of the guest of honor blowing out candles from every possible angle. The shared photo album is not an original idea. Various startups such as Keepsy, Hipstamatic and Albumatic have tried to make sharing albums easy, but many require everyone downloading the same app or signing up for a service. It makes much more sense as an additional feature on a site that is already a popular place for photo-sharing. More than a billion people are on Facebook, and they're sharing hundreds of millions of photos every day on the service, according to Facebook. It's surprising it took the company this long to add this simple, helpful feature.","Facebook is adding shared photo albums for up to 50 people .
Groups will be able to upload photos after social gatherings to the same album .

"(CNN) -- The best and worst thing about San Diego Comic-Con, the four-day mashup of geek and mainstream pop culture, is that the schedule is such an embarrassment of riches. What was once a haven for lovers of comics has expanded into a heaven for entertainment fans of all stripes, and this year's Comic-Con is no different. Starting Wednesday through Sunday, July 21, the San Diego Convention Center will be flooded with well over 100,000 attendees as they shuffle between panels promising exclusive previews and answers to fans' burning questions. But unless the goal is to not sleep for four days -- which it might be for some -- having a plan of attack is crucial. Even a Con-goer flying high off a rush of adrenaline, caffeine and Joss Whedon sightings needs to prioritize. It was difficult, but we've narrowed down the wealth of SDCC to 15 events that we're the most excited to see. That's not to say there isn't plenty more to take in, as we also have our eyes peeled for ""Kick-Ass 2""; ""The Big Bang Theory""; J.J. Abrams' new Fox pilot, ""Almost Human""; ""The Walking Dead""; ""True Blood""; and the first and only appearance of the ""How I Met Your Mother"" cast. But if you need a starting point, here are 15 events to highlight: . 'The X-Files' 20th Anniversary . Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny are staging an ""X-Files"" reunion at Comic-Con this year, marking the 20th anniversary since they first partnered as Agents Scully and Mulder on Fox's prime-time sci-fi series. Writer-producers like David Amann, Vince Gilligan and Howard Gordon, plus creator Chris Carter, will be here as well. 'Ender's Game' and 'Divergent' Summit Entertainment brought the ""Twilight"" masses to Comic-Con in the past, but this year they're arriving with fresh -- and pretty prestigious -- meat. Harrison Ford will join his ""Ender's Game"" co-stars Asa Butterfield, Hailee Steinfeld and Abigail Breslin for a Q&A with fans, who'll also get to see new footage of the November release. This panel will also offer a glimpse at another fan favorite adaptation, ""Divergent."" Author Veronica Roth, whose best-selling young adult novel has spawned a series and a massive following, will be here to take fan questions, along with the movie's stars, Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Miles Teller, Mekhi Phifer, and Maggie Q, among others. 'Dexter' The stars of Showtime's ""Dexter"" will convene in Convention Hall H for one last Comic-Con appearance. Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, David Zayas and James Remar will join the series' executive producers to take fan questions about the eighth and final season, which began in June. 'Veronica Mars' The Kickstarter-funded ""Veronica Mars"" movie just began filming, but Rob Thomas and the ""Mars"" crew already have some fun stuff to share with fans. Several of the cast members will be here, including Kristen Bell, Francis Capra, Enrico Colantoni, Percy Daggs III, Jason Dohring, Ryan Hansen, Chris Lowell, Tina Majorino and Krysten Ritter, plus Thomas. Fans who get into this chat will get to ask questions, learn details about the production and see footage from the film. 'Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' The only glitch for ""Walking Dead"" fans is that the show's panel overlaps with the first look at Joss Whedon's upcoming ABC series, ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" We've had a small taste of what's to come with a trailer, but additional ""top secret information"" plus surprise guests are on the bill for the Comic-Con panel. 'Game of Thrones' Fans will have an opportunity to get the scoop on the fourth season, which will begin filming this summer. Expect to see Emilia Clarke, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Peter Dinklage, Kit Harington and more. 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' Sony and Screen Gems are rolling out previews of four upcoming films, not the least of which is Marc Webb's ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2."" With Jamie Foxx joining Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone in the sequel -- in which the Oscar winner takes on the role of the villainous Electro -- we can't wait to see what sneak peeks will come out of Comic-Con. The other Sony-Screen Gems previews are ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,"" ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,"" and the remake of ""RoboCop"" -- with Samuel L. Jackson, Joel Kinnaman and Abbie Cornish. 'Orphan Black' If you've yet to become acquainted with the name Tatiana Maslany, now would be the time to do so -- especially ahead of awards season. The star of BBC America's ""Orphan Black"" is raking in the critical acclaim. Fans who are taken with this suspenseful series, about an orphan (Maslany) who takes on the identity of her look-alike after witnessing the woman's suicide, will get to ask questions about the addictive first season. 'Godzilla,' '300: Rise of an Empire,' 'Gravity' Warner Bros.' panel will feature Jeff Bridges' ""Seventh Son""; ""The LEGO Movie""; ""300: Rise of an Empire""; the George Clooney and Sandra Bullock space thriller ""Gravity""; and a do-not-skip preview of Gareth Edwards' ""Godzilla."" 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' This panel will also put a spotlight on Aaron Eckhart and Yvonne Strahovski in ""I, Frankenstein,"" but we're betting all eyes will be trained on what's in store for ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire."" It'll be the first time the franchise appears at Comic-Con, and fans can anticipate a look at new scenes, plus a Q&A. 'The Wolverine,' 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' We know that 20th Century Fox is going to feature ""The Wolverine"" and ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"" but we're more curious if the crew from ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" will be there as well. Going to the Con? Share your mini-interviews of interesting people and you could see them on CNN . 'Thor: The Dark World,' 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige is going to satisfy the fandom's thirst for glimpses of this year's ""Thor: The Dark World"" and 2014's ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier."" ""Surprise"" special guests are in store, so our fingers are crossed for double Chris action: ""Thor's"" Chris Hemsworth and ""Captain America's"" Chris Evans. 'Breaking Bad' Along with ""Dexter,"" Comic-Con is also giving AMC's ""Breaking Bad"" one final panel in honor of its last season. Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn and more stars will join creator Vince Gilligan to talk about filming those final eight episodes. There'll be an opportunity to ask questions, of course, and fans will get to see a sneak peek at the final episodes of season 5 ahead of the August 11 premiere. 50th anniversary of 'Doctor Who' Matt Smith is no longer ""Doctor Who,"" but he will be at Comic-Con to celebrate the 50th anniversary special with Jenna Coleman, David Bradley, Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat. It's unlikely that we'll also learn who the new ""Doctor"" will be, but we can hope. 'Community': Celebrating the fans . Given that it's the fandom that has truly held ""Community"" afloat on NBC for the past four seasons, we appreciate that the fans are getting their due this year -- even if it's only in the panel title. Gillian Jacobs, Danny Pudi, Yvette Nicole Brown, Alison Brie, Jim Rash and Ken Jeong will be at the panel, along with reinstated executive producer Dan Harmon. CNN's Henry Hanks contributed to this report.","San Diego Comic-Con has become a must for pop culture fans of all stripes .

"(CNN) -- Scientists are studying what caused tsunami-like waves that observers spotted near the New Jersey coast earlier this month. ""The source is complex and still under review,"" the National Weather Service's West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center says on its website. In New Jersey's Barnegat Inlet, a fisherman said he saw a massive, 6-foot-tall wave surging toward the coast on June 13. Tsunami-like waves were observed at more than 30 tide gauges in areas along the East Coast, the center said. Meteorological factors and the slumping of the continental shelf east of New Jersey may have played a role, the center said.","Fisherman describes a 6-foot wave near the New Jersey coast .

"(CNN) -- The gunshot wounds to two Ohio boys found dead in their grandparents' home are consistent with a homicide-suicide, a coroner said Friday. The two boys, who were half-brothers, were found Wednesday in Jackson, Ohio, about 75 miles south of Columbus. They were identified as Austin Wiseman, 12, and Blake Campbell, 9. Both boys suffered gunshot wounds to the head. The nature of the wounds and the bullets in their bodies indicated that the killings were a homicide-suicide, but it is not known whether they were accidental or intentional, said Dr. Gregory Hawker, the Jackson County coroner. ""We can't tell -- we might not ever know,"" he said. Family and friends have suggested that the older boy accidentally shot his younger brother and then was overcome with grief and turned the gun on himself, but there is no way to prove that forensically. ""Authorities have taken the older boy's computer to make sure there's no indication of ill intent,"" Hawker said. The older boy had become obsessed with guns in the last few weeks, he said. The boys lived with their grandparents and were unsupervised when the shooting happened, he said. The shooting occurred in an upstairs bedroom. ""That's crazy to think two young boys are dead, and no one knows anything about it,"" neighbor Michael Hatley told CNN affiliate WSAZ.

"(CNN) -- Sophia Banks says she has been a woman since birth, but for most of her life, people knew her as Daryl, her given name. The Canadian photographer started asking people to call her by her chosen name, Sophia, when she came out as a trans woman last year. It took time for people to adapt to her new name and refer to her as a woman using the pronoun ""she,"" Banks said. She would gently correct them because it was a fundamental part of who she was and the transition process. Just as Banks had to make clear her wishes, she expected those who knew her to respect them. 5 things to know about gender identity . ""I was born trans, I am a woman from birth but because I was born with a penis I was labeled a man,"" she said. ""What we do choose is when to come out, not what our gender is."" The issue of pronouns and gender identity resurfaced this week when Army Pvt. Bradley Manning announced his intention to transition from male to female in a statement signed ""Chelsea E. Manning."" ""The tiny matter of pronouns might seem insignificant but it's fundamental to the person whose identity is at stake. You want other people to see you for who you think you are,"" said Deborah Tannen, professor of linguistics at Georgetown University. ""In our society -- in principle -- we respect individual rights to self-determination,"" she said. ""If you believe that, then if a person tells you that their sense of who they are has changed, then they have right to express that."" As the press reported Manning's announcement, Banks and other trans rights activists criticized media outlets (including CNN) for not respecting Manning's wishes to be referred to as a woman with the pronouns ""she"" or ""her."" CNN's policy is to reference Manning with masculine pronouns since he has not yet taken any steps toward gender transition through surgery or hormone replacement therapy. The National Lesbian & Gay Journalists Association (NLGJA) issued guidelines for reporting on Manning's transition, advising journalists to ""use the name and pronouns that someone prefers,"" citing AP style and suggesting ""that she be referenced as 'U.S. Army Private Chelsea Manning, who formerly went by the name Bradley.' ""It is not about surgeries and hormones. If a person wants to talk about these very personal topics, fine, but one's gender identity and right to be respected aren't dependent on taking such actions, nor are these necessarily public topics,"" the NLGJA said in a statement. Could Bradley Manning become 'Chelsea' in civilian prison? Banks and others echoed those sentiments in impassioned conversations on Twitter. Their view that Manning should be referred to as Chelsea is consistent with their general belief that the right time to start calling someone by their chosen identity is when they state a preference. ""Transition is a very complicated and slow process. Should we really hold off on using someone's name and preferred pronouns because of what clothes they are wearing or how long they have been on [hormone replacement therapy]?"" Banks said. Sure, It can be difficult to change habits if you've known someone for a long time, but it's a key step, said Jody M. Huckaby, executive director of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays National. ""Referring to someone in their preferred gender identity by name and with proper pronouns sends an important message that everyone deserves to be respected, regardless of who they are and how they identify,"" he said. ""We all meet new people all the time with whom we've had no prior interaction. If you have questions about someone's preferred pronoun, respectfully ask them. If you already know the person, it's understandable that you will probably make mistakes in the beginning but keep working on getting it right."" The same rules apply for asking anyone questions about their personal life, Matt Kailey, an author and blogger who focuses on transgender and transsexual issues, wrote in a blog post, ""Trans Etiquette for Non-Trans People."" Treat them as you would any other person and don't make their gender identity the focal point of all discussions, Kailey says. Ask questions that seem appropriate for the setting and don't make assumptions. If you use the wrong pronoun, move on and don't make a scene, especially in public; setting is everything. In other words, treat the person like you would any other person of that gender and learn the terms so you can discuss transgender-related topics more comfortably. It can be hard in a society where everything is patterned by gender, from clothes and toys to occupations to restrooms, Tannen said. Imagining someone as a man or a woman and not transgender can help people adjust to the idea. ""Think about homosexuality. People were once baffled by it and now vast majority of people are comfortable with it,"" she said. ""But with time and exposure to more and more people, they will come to understand and accept it as well."" In Manning's case, the private remains a male in the eyes of the U.S. Army, according to one Army official who was not authorized to speak publicly about Manning's case. Another said Manning would be treated like any other prisoner. ""A lot of the inmates have issues they're dealing with,"" said the second official, who also was not authorized to speak publicly about the case. ""Even if you have gender identity disorder, you still serve your sentence."" A previous version of this story incorrectly stated Sophia Banks' given name. CNN regrets the error.","Private Bradley Manning identifies as transgender; wants to be called Chelsea Manning .

"(CNN) -- From Superstorm Sandy and last year's drought to tornadoes, wildfires and a hurricane, the weather and climate disasters of 2012 caused more than $110 billion in damages, making it one of the costliest years on record for weather events, national climate data show. There were 11 disaster events last year, each one causing more than $1 billion in damages, the National Climatic Data Center said. Since 1980, only 2005 had a higher damage total at $160 billion, according to the center, which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The two most expensive disasters were Sandy, which caused about $65 billion in losses, and the yearlong drought, which cost about $30 billion, the center said. The drought, which affected more than half the country for most of 2012, also led to several wildfires and a fatal heatwave, the center said. Among the other major disasters of 2012 were tornadoes in the Southeast, Ohio Valley, Texas and the Midwest, along with Hurricane Isaac and severe storms across the country.","There were 11 major disaster events last year .

"(CNN) -- It's almost unfathomable to believe that Sinead O'Connor couldn't have seen this coming. Earlier this week, in an open letter to Miley Cyrus, the Irish singer-songwriter offered the lately controversial pop star such tough-love advice as ""you don't need to let the music business make a prostitute of you"" and ""They're there for the money..."" and ""Kindly fire any --- who hasn't expressed alarm, because they don't care about you."" Cyrus has certainly seemed to ask for such admonition -- and warning. In recent weeks, she's shocked the world with antics that have included a seamy, hypersexual awards show performance, a music video in which she swings around naked on demolition equipment and licks sledgehammers, and a Terry Richardson photo session in which she's depicted smoking blunts and violating herself with a red bodysuit. She has officially, and unfortunately, ushered the word ""twerking"" into the vernacular. In return, she's been called ""crude,"" ""a hot mess,"" and a lot worse. She's also gotten immense attention, which is, of course, the point of all of this. When in a recent Rolling Stone interview Cyrus said that O'Connor's 1990 video for ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" helped inspire her own video for her new single, ""Wrecking Ball,"" O'Connor, it seems, saw an opening. She swiftly posted a 1,000-word letter to her website and Facebook page, issued, she claimed, ""in the spirit of motherliness and love"" and telling the younger musician why and how she should value her body, which is ""for you and your boyfriend"" and not the music honchos who ""will be sunning themselves on their yachts in Antigua, which they bought by selling your body."" But by choosing to hand down her advice in such a public forum, O'Connor effectively proved that the aspiring yacht owners aren't the only ones out to get something from Cyrus. She easily could have sent Cyrus a private letter. Instead, O'Connor chose to initiate a very public shaming. That, of course, provoked an aggressive response, igniting a woman-on-woman battle likely as damaging to young female onlookers as O'Connor's condemnation of Cyrus' self-exploitation. Once again, we have women beating down on other women. A near-teenager under attack, Cyrus responded like any near-teenager under attack might: Instantly and cruelly. She compared O'Connor to troubled actress Amanda Bynes, tweeting a screen shot of messages O'Connor had posted to Twitter two years ago about her own emotional health. Then she said she was too busy to get into it with O'Connor, because she had a ""Saturday Night Live"" gig to prep for. O'Connor's sympathy for Cyrus, a ""victim"" in her eyes only hours earlier, immediately turned far less understanding as she threatened legal action if Cyrus didn't apologize and remove the tweets. She then mocked Cyrus in an objectifying way that was particularly ironic given such missives in her original note as ""you are worth more than your body or your sexual appeal"" and ""women are to be valued for so much more than their sexuality."" She wrote that Cyrus ""can take five minutes today between G-string (effing) changes to publicly apologize."" That's not to say O'Connor doesn't have a point -- or a good one. She has called for a public discussion of how male executives at record labels manage young female stars and whether their decisions are always or ever in a star's best interest. After all, who is looking out for Miley? Certainly not her parents and certainly not the men from her record company, who are making a ton of money off of her. Larry Rudolph, best known for guiding the career of Britney Spears, is heading Team Cyrus, surely he must know there can be a price to pay when the act overshadows the talent. There is a shelf life on outrageous behavior, as so many young stars have found out who came before Miley. So, one might give O'Connor the benefit of doubt. She was concerned for Cyrus and thought, somehow, that insulting her in a public forum was the quickest and most direct way to reach her. But by assuming that Cyrus isn't in charge -- or, more poignantly, suggesting to Cyrus that she wasn't in charge -- and by inviting a global audience to sit in on the belittling, O'Connor was very carefully and specifically asking for a fight. And a fight she got. The letter could have been the best and most honest advice Cyrus has ever received, but delivery -- and intention --matters. And O'Connor wasn't in it just for Cyrus, now was she? For fans of Cyrus, the best bet is to focus on the music. Cyrus might not be role model material at the moment, but if you don't look to her for more than catchy tunes, there's less chance that she'll disappoint. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Sinead O'Connor posted an open letter to Miley Cyrus telling her she's a victim .

"(CNN) -- Carlos Tevez marked his Juventus debut with the winning goal, but it was not enough to put the Italian champions top of Serie A after the opening day of matches. That honor went to Verona following the promoted side's shock 2-1 victory over AC Milan earlier Saturday. However, Juve's bid for a 30th scudetto began with few scares against the only team to have beaten the Turin side home and away last season. Tevez, a $15 million arrival from English club Manchester City in preseason, started up front while fellow new forward signing Fernando Llorente was on the substitutes' bench. The Argentina international was denied a first-half goal by keeper Angelo Da Costa, who also saved from Kwadwo Asamoah's header, but he made no mistake from close range in the 58th minute after being set up by Paul Pogba. It was Tevez's second goal for the club, having also netted in last Sunday's 4-0 Italian Super Cup win over Lazio. That match was marred by racist chanting by some home fans, and as a result Lazio's opening home match this season against Udinese will be played with a section of the stands closed. Sampdoria had substitute Paolo Castellini sent off in time added on for a foul on Stephan Lichtsteiner. Llorente was given a brief debut when he came on for Mirko Vicunic in the 89th minute, while Tevez gave way to Sebastian Giovinco. Verona celebrated the end of the club's 11-year wait for a top-flight match, as veteran former Italy striker Luca Toni headed two goals to defeat last season's third-placed team Milan. The seven-time European champions, held 1-1 by Dutch club PSV Eindhoven in last week's Champions League qualifier, took the lead in the 14th minute when Mario Balotelli set up midfielder Andrea Poli. However, Toni headed home a corner just before the half-hour mark and the 36-year-old repeated the feat from Bosko Jankovic's cross in the 53rd minute. Balotelli had two strong shouts for a penalty, but the Italy striker ended up with just a booking for his efforts after complaining bitterly when denied on the latter occasion.","Serie A season kicks off Saturday with champions Juventus beating Sampdoria .

When it started the operator had just two planes, but now it has expanded its fleet to 28. To date the Air asia group, has carried over 35 million guests. In August 2003, Air asia became the first airline in the world to introduce SMS booking where guests can book their seats, check flight schedules and obtain latest updates on Air asia promotions from the convenience of their mobile phones. In Jan 2004, Air asia carved a milestone in the history of Asian aviation when the low fare airline formed a partnership with Shin Corporation in Thailand to develop a low fare carrier in Thailand. In July 2004, the low fare airline commenced service to the Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Macau, by introducing a flight via is Thai operations from Bangkok. In April 2005, the Air asia Group became the first low fare, no frills airline to commence services between Bangkok and Xiamen, in China, and Clark (the Philippines) from Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu. In line with its growth and expansion plans, Air asia has secured a 130 aircraft commitment with Airbus for its A320s (100 firm, 30 options). The 130 aircraft order will place Air asia as the single largest customer for the aircraft in Asia-Pacific, and potentially one of the largest airline fleets in the region. The new aircraft would gradually replaced Air asia's existing Boeing 737-300s. . E-mail to a friend .","Air asia launched as a low fare, no frills airline in 2001 .

"(CNN) -- ""The British aren't coming! The British aren't coming!"" screams the headline of New York's Daily News, describing Britain as ""normally reliable"" but now a surprising let-down for U.S. President Barack Obama. Following a lengthy debate in the UK parliament Thursday, a majority voted against the government's motion to militarily intervene in Syria in response to an alleged chemical attack by the Assad regime. The result of the emergency meeting has been described in the press as a humiliating defeat for both UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Obama. The New York Times says Cameron's intentions were hasty and the result of the vote was a ""blow"" to the U.S. president. ""Like nearly all presidents since the Vietnam War, he has relied on Britain to be shoulder-to-shoulder with Washington in any serious military or security engagement,"" it said. Writing for Canada's National Post, author Kelly McParland criticizes U.S. President Barack Obama's approach as slow and indecisive. ""Syria's government can only feel fortunate that so grievous a violation of international norms has provoked so uncertain and disjointed a response,"" she concludes. Al Jazeera reports UK finance minister George Osborne's view that the result will diminish Britain's position in the world and fray the bond it has with the U.S. Russia's weekly newspaper the Moscow News says the debate is ""a stunning defeat"" for Cameron. They also add that the White House has said Thursday's U.N. Security Council permanent member meeting, which failed to reach a conclusion, was another effort by Russia to not hold the Syrian regime accountable for the use of chemical weapons. Russia's English-speaking daily, Moscow Times, says there are eight issues that must be considered before carrying out an attack on Syria. It says the main point is that Western leaders are not thinking about the bigger picture, such as whether military intervention will actually prevent further use of chemical weapons. The paper also suggests pushing for diplomatic instead of military resolutions. The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson writes: ""The prime minister has lost control of his own foreign and defence policy and as a result he will cut a diminished figure on the international stage."" He adds that the prime minister's defeat will be mostly felt within his own party. UK's daily newspaper The Independent said Cameron's military plans were ""shot down in a dramatic Commons vote"" and that ""foreign policy is in disarray."" It adds that the prime minister's ""humiliating defeat"" questions his leadership. The paper also claimed the loss was a win for opposition leader Ed Miliband, who supported military intervention but then spoke firmly against it. According to the paper, some Tory ministers were quite confused. In the British political television program Newsnight, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond twice referred to the need to deter ""Saddam Hussein"" from chemical warfare. British tabloid newspaper The Mirror also claims that UK politicians cannot pin Damascus on a map. ""One person picked Texas - hopefully they were joking,"" quips the paper. Britain's Daily Mail newspaper suggests Cameron has shot himself in the foot, describing him as the ""Grand Old Duke of York"" attempting to march his men to the top of the hill. ""He now discovers that he has charged up his own hill while the majority of the British people and indeed a majority of their MPs remain stubbornly at the bottom."" Time Magazine reminds readers in its blog that the British government's desire to take action in Syria is nothing new, including numerous warnings to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to stop attacks on his own people. French news outlet France 24 expresses shock at the result of the vote, claiming that the nation's President Francois Hollande will maintain his firm stance in support of military intervention. Unlike in the UK, the French leader does not need a vote in parliament to back his actions. Hollande is also quoted as saying that Britain's agreement is not needed: ""Each country is sovereign to participate or not in an operation. That is valid for Britain as it is for France."" The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong reflects on the Iraq War -- the memory of which clouded the debate in parliament and gave rise to concerns from politicians who remember the invasion only too vividly, it says. However, unlike the uncertain grounds of that war, the paper points to the strong evidence of the use of chemical weapons. ""Unlike Iraq in 2003, the triggering event in Syria a decade later is not a shaky argument that the government possesses weapons of mass destruction, but a rocket assault that left hundreds of victims convulsing and gasping for breath, glassy-eyed and foaming at the mouth -- all classic symptoms of a reaction to poison gas."" However, some feel excluded from the debate altogether. The online version of the Israeli Haaretz Newspaper claims that Israel should have been a part of the discussion: ""During the lengthy debate in the British parliament over a possible military intervention in Syria on Thursday, Israel barely featured.""","British members of parliament voted against military intervention in Syria .
The decision goes against the government's motion and U.S. President Barack Obama's intentions ."
"(CNN) -- Forget the macho world of the standard shoot-'em up video game. Rather than relying on blood, gore and mayhem, a number of game developers are tapping into their inner emotions, inviting gamers along for adventures of the psyche. Recent releases ""Tomb Raider"" and ""BioShock Infinite"" evoked an emotional response by creating characters with which gamers could identify and empathize. Now ""The Last of Us"" ups the stakes with its story of two people surviving in a post-apocalyptic world -- Joel, a grizzled man who has seen too much, and Ellie, a young girl who could be the future of the world. ""The thing we heard consistently (from focus groups) was 'I've never cared for characters as much as I've cared for Joel and Ellie,' "" Naughty Dog creative director Neil Druckmann told CNN. ""There are moments we want to show close-ups, we want to show really subtle performances, and that's where cut scenes are really useful. But we really use interaction to get you to connect, between Ellie and Joel, in a way you couldn't do in film."" It's an increasingly popular approach in a segment of gaming where ammo and attitude have traditionally reigned supreme. In ""Tomb Raider,"" players journeyed with a young and unsure Lara Croft through an early adventure in her career. They got to experience her anguish and joy as the star of the long-running franchise made her first kill or rescued close friends. With ""BioShock Infinite,"" an entire team was devoted to bringing the Elizabeth character to life. That level of care and precision resulted in a character who evoked a visceral response from the player -- one so real, designers said, that gamers would feel like they're part of something larger than playing a game. ""The Last of Us"" designers at Naughty Dog wanted to bring different elements together to get gamers to feel attached to Joel and Elle. It had to be more than just intense moments, they said; it needed to come together seamlessly and sell their relationship to the player. The game action is centered on a fungal outbreak that possesses humans and transforms them into ... well, zombies. Joel is older and has seen life on both sides of the outbreak. Ellie, just 14, was born into the post-outbreak world. Their different viewpoints on life and how it should be lived were important to developing the relationship between the two characters. ""How much we dedicate to those characters and building those characters and have those characters shift and change and go through these dynamic arcs and the gameplay supports that,"" studio director Bruce Straley said. ""They feed off each other."" Early reactions suggest the dynamic works. ""We've had people cry when playing the game for us,"" Druckmann said. ""There are about three spots in the game where people cry. Two of those are in cut scenes, and one of those is in game play."" He said he thinks the gameplay scene is the most powerful. ""You are so invested in the characters, and you're using these mechanics and then all of the sudden ... I can't say too much without spoiling it, but we flip a mechanic on its head and it doesn't do what you expect because of where the characters are at,"" Druckmann said. ""You see people just lose it, and it's awesome."" Straley and Druckmann said they used different literary sources as inspiration for the game's emotional journey. One movie, in particular, struck a chord with both. ""We came out of 'No Country for Old Men' mouth agape, wide-eyed, going, 'Oh my God, what just happened?' and 'Could you ever experience that tension and emotion in a video game? Can you achieve that with a joystick in your hand?' "" Straley said. ""In this world, anything can happen, and you as the player get to control that outcome and feel that tension."" But are gamers looking to cry over their characters? Is there a danger of turning off gamers because they may get too emotionally involved? Both ""Tomb Raider"" and ""BioShock Infinite"" garnered commercial and critical success, suggesting that hard-core players are open to more than just another shooter. Each asked the player to take a fresh look at some familiar gaming situations, using the main characters as a canvas on which to create the experience. ""The Last of Us"" similarly asks players to tackle a challenging question -- in the horrible circumstances in which many games are set, how do you find, and define, your humanity? ""That's what all good true drama is based on -- that conflict and difficult choices and the human experience,"" Straley said. Druckmann said he wants players to come away thinking about deep issues, such as the dynamics of relationships and what it takes to keep them alive. ""You sit down. You play the game and you're going to have moments,"" he said. ""That's what we've set out to do. We want to give people moments."" ""The Last of Us"" is available worldwide. The game is a PlayStation 3 exclusive title. It is rated M for Mature due to blood and gore, intense violence, sexual themes and strong language.","In new top video games, designers are working hard to move players emotionally .

"(CNN) -- Mon Dieu, how things change! A decade ago, France's opposition to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq caused such disdain that restaurants across the United States began calling French fries ""freedom fries."" Some Americans bandied around the term ""cheese-eating surrender monkeys,"" coined by TV show ""The Simpsons,"" for their Gallic cousins, while then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair became George W. Bush's BFF. Yet on Friday, as the United States tried to rally support for military intervention in Syria, Secretary of State John Kerry had only fond words for the French, calling them ""our oldest ally."" Hollande, in turn, described the two nations as ""close friends and allies."" Meanwhile, Britain -- whose Parliament voted against military intervention in an embarrassing defeat for Prime Minister David Cameron -- was relegated to an unfamiliar backseat position as Washington gears up for potential combat. So did Kerry's words signal a new era in French-American relations? While France has been a historical ally of the United States, going back more than two centuries to the Revolutionary War, in more recent times the French and their American cousins have not always marched to the beat of the same drummer. French President Jacques Chirac was sharply critical of the Bush administration as it tried to drum up support to invade Iraq in 2003 without a U.N. mandate. ""Iraq today does not represent an immediate threat that justifies an immediate war,"" he said in March 2003. His opposition earned him then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's scorn, as he dismissed France as belonging to ""old Europe."" Undeterred, Chirac's tone was no softer six months later, when he addressed the U.N. General Assembly in New York. ""The war, launched without the authorization of the Security Council, shook the multilateral system,"" he said. ""The United Nations has just been through one of the most grave crises in its history."" When former President Ronald Reagan launched air strikes back in 1986 on sites connected to Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, after an incident in which Libyan agents had bombed a disco in Berlin, killing two Americans, France denied U.S. planes access to its airspace, according to news reports from the time. The aircraft instead took off from Britain. At that point, Francois Mitterand was in the presidential palace, while Chirac was prime minister. More recently, Hollande told President Barack Obama during an Oval Office meeting days after he was elected to the French presidency that he would stand by his campaign pledge to withdraw French combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of the year. France was one of the bigger contributors of troops to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, making its withdrawal a blow to the Obama administration. But when Gadhafi was again in the sights of the international community in 2011, as Libyan rebels fought for his ouster, then-President Nicolas Sarkozy was an enthusiastic participant in the conflict. French fighter planes bombarded pro-Gadhafi forces as part of a NATO effort also spearheaded by Britain, while the United States kept a low profile. Sarkozy and Cameron gave a passionate speech together in the Libyan city of Benghazi, newly united after the divisions prompted by the war in Iraq. France's involvement didn't do much to help Sarkozy's re-election effort the following May, when he lost out to Hollande, but it did perhaps indicate a willingness by France's leaders to re-engage with international diplomacy. Hollande has carried on the trend, sending French forces into Mali, at the African nation's invitation, to help push back militant Islamists earlier this year. But if international strikes on Syria go ahead, and France plays a part, Hollande may be in need of his transatlantic buddies. Nearly two out of three French people are opposed to a military intervention in Syria led by an international coalition including France, according to figures released Saturday by one of the country's main polling agencies and published by daily newspaper Le Parisien. Another survey, by the BVA polling agency, suggested 58% of those surveyed do not trust Hollande to lead a military intervention in Syria. But while Hollande is currently the Obama administration's golden boy, it's probably too soon to count out the long-running Anglo-American friendship hailed, in Britain at least, as the ""special relationship."" Foreign Secretary William Hague made it onto Kerry's call list Friday -- and Obama and Cameron are also still speaking. A readout of their call Friday from the White House said that the United States ""values the special relationship with the United Kingdom, a close ally and friend."" And a 10 Downing Street readout of the same call said Obama ""stressed his appreciation of his strong friendship with the Prime Minister and of the strength, durability and depth of the special relationship between our two countries."" The House of Commons defeat was clearly a blow for Cameron, who has repeatedly spoken of the need for robust action on Syria, but the loss of British support for potential U.S. action is more symbolic than militarily significant. The two nations have weathered plenty of storms together in the past and will likely find themselves back on the same page in future. Washington stood behind Britain when it went to war against Argentina in 1982, following the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands, a disputed British territory in the South Atlantic. The two were also key allies during World War II, leading then-Prime Minister Winston Churchill to first describe their bond in 1946 as the ""special relationship"" that would help prevent future wars and bolster world stability. In the meantime, Obama can cozy up with France, Turkey -- which has also voiced support for military intervention -- and other Arab regional players, while Cameron nurses his wounded pride. CNN's Chelsea Carter and Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","Secretary of State John Kerry hails France as the United States' ""oldest ally""

"(CNN) -- On the starting line of the Emirates Motorplex on Thursday (Jan 24) will be professional drift racing, one of the most dangerous disciplines in motorsport. And amid the petrol fumes and testosterone will be a 23-year-old Palestinian woman, Noor Daoud. Daoud, who had previously been invited to compete in a Formula 3 - a different discipline of motor racing - race in Israel, is the first Arab woman to compete on the international motorsport circuit. She has spent two months in the United Arab Emirates training for the Drift UAE race on January 24, and will then go on to other international races in Japan and Poland. Drifting is a driving technique, born in Japan, in which the driver intentionally oversteers, causing the rear wheels to skid, while maintaining control of the car. ""It's a big race and all the international people will be there. I'm the first Arab girl to race in it, so it's huge for me,"" said Daoud. ""I really want to make this my career. I'm really serious about it. ""I just want to show the world what I can do. I'm not only doing this for myself, I'm doing it for my country. I want to show that Palestinian people can make it."" Daoud has previously competed at a world-class level in swimming, tennis and soccer and also loves boxing and motorcross. She says motor racing has become her favorite sport since joining an all-female Palestinian motor racing team, Speed Sisters. Speed Sisters became a team in 2009 with the support of the British consulate in Jerusalem. Now a Canadian filmmaker, Amber Fares, is making a feature-length documentary about the Speed Sisters and their incredible journey from the streets of the West Bank. Daoud has been able to take her career to an international level because she was born in Texas and holds an U.S. passport. Her fellow Speed Sisters have traveled no further than Jordan for street car races, but compete regularly on the popular Palestinian street car circuit. Also on Inside the Middle East: Inside a dictator's palace: Fake diplomas, sports cars, stuffed leopard . Maysoon Jayyusi, formerly a Speed Sister herself, now manages the team and is the Palestinian representative on the FIA's Women in Motorsport Commission. Jayyusi, 36, first got into motor racing because a colleague at the United Nations, who was also head of the Palestinian Motorsport Federation, suggested she try racing after seeing her driving home from work. ""It's exciting for us, especially as women; we want to improve ourselves and show that we can achieve what we like,"" said Jayyusi. ""We want to challenge the ideas that women can only work in the kitchen and that Palestinian people can't live normal lives."" When Jayyusi took up the sport, she was so worried about telling her parents about her new hobby that they only found out when she started to appear in newspaper articles. ""They are a traditional Arab family and don't encourage women to participate in sport,"" she said. ""They accept it now because they know we are strong."" The Speed Sisters core team also includes Betty Saadeh, 31, from Bethlehem, Marah Zahalka, 21, from Jenin, and Muna Ennab, from Ramallah. In 2011, the team was invited to Silverstone, home of the British Grand Prix, for training. But the quest for success is still a struggle for the Speed Sisters. Jayyusi said they don't have a regular training ground, must scramble to find enough money to compete and cannot take their cars abroad because of travel restrictions. ""This year I have a new agenda that we want to make connections with motorsports in other countries and arrange exchanges,"" said Jayyusi. Fares, who is of Lebanese heritage, decided to make a film about the Speed Sisters while living in the West Bank because she wanted to show Arab women in a way not often seen in Western media. ""Women racing cars is pretty much the last thing you would expect to happen in Palestine. ""They are amazing girls and their stories resonate with people. When people hear about their story, they find them inspirational."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Paris Hilton whips up a storm in holy Mecca . Daoud finds her inspiration from within. ""It's a dangerous sport and I really enjoy the adrenaline,"" she said. ""When you are driving something really powerful, you and the car must be one. I feel the power and I feel no fear. ""Sometimes after a race I get out of the car and take off my helmet and people say 'Oh my God, it's a girl.' ""Some people don't like it and say I should get a husband and have children or that I should be cleaning the house, but I just ignore them.""","Speed Sisters became first all-female Palestinian motor racing team in 2009 .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in San Francisco are asking for help from anybody who witnessed a recent fatal stabbing of a Dodgers fan after a man once suspected in the case was released. The fatal slashing occurred Wednesday night and some have said it stemmed from the long-standing baseball rivalry between fans of the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants. The incident occurred after the Dodgers and Giants played and a man wearing Dodgers gear was killed just blocks from the San Francisco stadium. The victim was Jonathan Denver, 24, the son of a Dodgers security guard. A day after the stabbing, police arrested a 21-year-old man and said he faced a homicide charge. But Friday night that man was released from jail, CNN affiliate KGO reported. The San Francisco District Attorney's Office released a statement about the case asking for witnesses to come forward.

"(CNN) -- A 224-foot-long U.S. warship will have to be cut into smaller pieces to get it off a Philippine reef where it grounded two weeks ago, Navy officials said Wednesday. They said that's the only way to prevent further damage to the Tubbataha Reef, a Philippine national park and UNESCO World Heritage site, where the USS Guardian, an Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship, ran aground on January 17. Survivors mark anniversary of cruise ship grounding . Lt. Anthony Falvo, a U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet spokesman in Pearl Harbor,Hawaii, told CNN on Wednesday that Navy salvage experts are stillformulating the details of how they'll cut up the 1,312-ton minesweeper. Crews are now working to remove any hazardous materials from the vessel and will look to save anything that could still prove useful tothe Navy. The ship's 15,000 gallons of diesel fuel were removed lastweek. ""We will strip it out beforehand. We'll work to salvage any parts thatcan be salvaged,"" Falvo said. Then the cutting will begin. Illegal weapons seized from ship . Heavy-lift cranes are expected at the site of the grounding, about 80miles (130 kilometers) east-southeast of Palawan Island in the Sulu Sea,in the next few days, Falvo said. The cranes will lift the pieces of theGuardian onto barges or other ships to be taken away. Last week, the Navy said it hoped to lift the ship off the reef in itsentirety. But Falvo said Wednesday that after reviewing all thealternatives, it was decided it would have to be cut up. After it struck the reef, initial efforts to free the Guardian at hightide were unsuccessful. Its crew of 79 was evacuated to other vessels,and the ship was battered by waves that pushed it farther onto the reef,causing leaks in its wood-and-fiberglass hull. ""The ship cannot move on its own, and it is not operational,"" Rear Adm.Tom Carney said last week. Stripping, cutting up and removing the Guardian from the reef could takemore than a month, Falvo said Wednesday. This isn't the first time the Navy has had to undertake such anoperation, but it hasn't happened in more than 40 years. In August 1971,the supply ship USS Regulus grounded in Hong Kong harbor during Typhoon Rose, Falvo said. It took more than a month to cut that vessel up and remove it, he said. A similar operation was also conducted in 1916, he said. As for what the loss of the Guardian, one of 14 Avenger class minecountermeasures ships in the Navy, means for the service, Falvo said itwas too early to speculate. He pointed out that the vessel was in the23rd year of its expected 30-year lifespan. The ship cost about $61 million to build, Lt. Cmdr. James Stockman, aNavy spokesman, said last week. As for other costs, Philippine officials said last week that thePhilippines would seek compensation for damage to the reef. About 1,000 square meters (about 10,760 square feet) of it have been damaged. ""It's a damage to a world heritage site. It's a damage to our naturalresources. It's a damage to an important site. We cannot but putemphasis on the importance of this reef as a heritage site,""presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda said. Navy commander apologizes for grounding . The reef is home to a vast array of sea, air and land creatures, as wellas sizable lagoons and two coral islands. About 500 species of fish and350 species of coral can be found there, as can whales, dolphins,sharks, turtles and breeding seabirds, according to UNESCO. The salvage operation must ensure that the reef sustains nofurther damage, Lacierda said. Navy officials are still trying to determine how the Guardian ended upon the reef.

""The U.S. Navy investigation will review what charts Guardian was using.While this erroneous navigation chart data is important information, noone should jump to conclusions,"" Stockman said.

"(CNN) -- Since she was a college student, Ilene Gordon dreamed of running a Fortune 500 company. She finally achieved that goal last year when her company Ingredion exceeded sales of $6 billion for the first time, making her one of only 21 women to run a company in the coveted Fortune 500 list. ""Over a 35 year career, I got there,"" said Gordon, chief executive, chairman and president of Ingredion. ""When we became a Fortune 500 company a year ago when our sales hit over six billion, I have to say that was my dream, it was very satisfying to fulfil that dream."" In the four years since Gordon joined Ingredion -- which makes food additives such as starches and corn syrup - its share price has gone from $25 to $60. ""We're a very global company with over 11,000 people,"" she said. ""So really my job entails not only running the company from our Chicago base but really getting out into the field and to our 40 different factories. "" ""It's a 24/7 job. I love it, and I've built on my whole career to be ready for a position like this."" Her achievement is even more remarkable given the company has faced a public backlash over one of its staple products, high-fructose corn syrup, which many people blame for rising obesity. When Gordon joined the company -- then called Corn Products -- in 2009, she quickly diversified into other products, acquired National Starch and changed its name to Ingredion to reflect its new focus. ""We really diversified and actually only 14% of our sales globally are focused on high fructose for the soft drink industry,"" said Gordon. ""It is a perception problem and high fructose and sugar are really the same dynamics,"" said Gordon. ""Consumers really want healthy food, and so it became clear that to grow the company why not grow with this trend of people looking for health and nutrition type ingredients. ""So we've made acquisitions, and we've diversified away from that and really have grown the company with modified starches that really provide a very healthy ingredient."" Gordon, born in 1953, studied math at MIT in the 1970s, originally intending to be a high school math teacher. ""Instead I met these incredible women that were going to be lawyers, doctors, and PhDs in nutrition and science,"" she said. ""It really influenced me to say 'Wait a minute. I can do more than teach.' which was a traditional field. And that's when I decided to go into business."" Gordon earned a Masters degree in business and decided to go into manufacturing because there were so few women, and she felt it was an opportunity to be a ""pioneer"". This eventually led to her first CEO role, heading up Alcun Packaging, a division of Rio Tinto. ""They wanted me to move to Paris and make a decision in 48 hours. My family was in Chicago, and I didn't know quite how we would make it happen. But it was a great opportunity to be a global CEO of a six and half billion dollar company, and I said 'I'll take it, and I'll figure it out."" Gordon has never been afraid of standing out. At school, she complained to her principal about being forced to take sewing and cooking classes with the girls, and instead took shop lessons with the boys. Later, at MIT, she was outnumbered by more than 10 to one by men. ""I've always pushed ahead and been a pioneer in everything that I've done,"" she said.","Ilene Gordon is one of only 21 women running Fortune 500 companies .

"(CNN) -- Imagine seeing masterpieces by Van Gogh, entertaining your kids with activities and strolling a hilltop garden with waterfalls and beautiful views at sunset. Now imagine doing it all for free. That's how your day could play out at the Getty Museum in L.A., where admission doesn't cost a thing. Enjoying what America has to offer can get expensive fast: in 2011, the U.S. travel industry made $813 billion, and some of America's most popular cities are also its most expensive. With high gas prices and airline fees, it's refreshing to know that there are still some venues like the Getty that give another meaning to the land of the free. In our search for the top free attractions, we bypassed public parks and train stations to focus on experiences you wouldn't necessarily expect to be free. Find out just how far $0 can get you from coast to coast. Smithsonian Museums, Washington, D.C. The National Zoo, National Museum of Natural History, and National Air and Space Museum‚Äîwhich displays The Spirit of St. Louis‚Äîare the biggest crowd-pleasers among the 18 Smithsonian institutions in D.C., otherwise one of the country's priciest cities. Indeed, making knowledge accessible is key to the mission of the world's largest museum and research complex. Affordable-travel expert Tim Leffel observed that the three museums he visited with his wife and daughter would have set them back more than $100 in most European capitals. And here's a bonus: you can download a free app about the National Mall sites from the National Park Service. New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park . Most national parks encourage you to tune in to nature; this one celebrates jazz in its birthplace, New Orleans. There's live music at the visitor center in the French Quarter and the Old U.S. Mint six days a week, and a kids' music workshop on Saturdays at Perseverance Hall in Louis Armstrong Park. The visitor center also hosts free talks, video documentaries and exhibits on local jazz history. You can pick up one of two self-guided audio tours, ""Jazz Sites in New Orleans"" or ""Jazz Walk of Fame."" Travel + Leisure: Best U.S. cities for affordable getaways . The Getty Center, Los Angeles . Maximize your time at the Getty by visiting on a Friday or Saturday, when this sprawling hillside art complex is open late‚Äîallowing you to take in sunset views. The light-filled museum interiors display an impressive collection of European and American art including Vincent van Gogh's famous irises. Debbie Dubrow of the family travel blog Delicious Baby recommends the Family Room's interactive exhibits, giant illuminated manuscripts and an art treasure hunt. ""And whenever you need a break, just pop outside to the Getty's fabulous gardens,"" she says. While parking is admittedly expensive ($15), the Getty is also accessible by public transit. Staten Island Ferry, New York City . Even in the most expensive city in America, you can find great deals like free admission nights at MoMA (otherwise $25), discounted Broadway tickets, and lower hotel rates in July and August. Then there's the thrill of one of the world's most beautiful ferry rides on the Staten Island commuter ferry‚Äîwhich also happens to be free 24/7. Board at sunset, when Lady Liberty is silhouetted against a pink-and-orange sky. You'll pass the Statue of Liberty, with a panoramic view of glittering downtown Manhattan, Brooklyn and Jersey City.

It's an added bonus that parking is unusually affordable for Waikiki: free for an hour with validation. 7 amazing island rentals . The Alamo, San Antonio, Texas . ""Remember the Alamo!"" became a rallying cry after a small group of Texans stationed at this Catholic mission was defeated in March 1836 by a Mexican army after a 13-day siege. These days, the Alamo chapel is an official Texas State Shrine‚Äîand the state's most popular site with more than 2.5 million annual visitors. After your visit, stroll the nearby River Walk, lined with shops and restaurants like Boudro's for homemade guacamole and prickly-pear margaritas. Pike Place Market, Seattle . This iconic Seattle waterfront market occupies nine acres with an assortment of vendors selling fresh, locally produced food‚Äîmost famously, flying fish.

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. Natural disasters, revolutionary technology, pro-athlete scandals and national calamities marked 2007 as an unforgettable year. Yet, amid these major happenings arose stories that were overlooked, unseen or ignored altogether: tales of our nation's work force. Understandably, these pieces weren't as newsworthy as Michael Vick's dog fighting charges or Paris Hilton going to jail. But these stories held an angle unlike any other: They were just plain weird. Here are 15 headlines that exemplify the strange happenings that took place in the workplace in 2007. 1. ""Employee eats 32 vending machine items for charity"" A juvenile probation officer ate one of every item in a county courthouse vending machine in one day. She consumed more than 7,000 calories and more than 300 grams of fat, eating such items as beef sticks, candy bars, Pop Tarts and potato chips -- all to win a bet with co-workers and raise $300 for charity. 2. ""Cola wars get physical as Pepsi worker attacks Coke employee"" Two employees from the rival companies got into a tiff over shelf space in the aisle of a Wal-Mart in Indiana. The Pepsi worker allegedly assaulted the Coca-Cola employee, hitting him in the face, giving him a black eye and breaking his nose. Police say the two were also accused of trying to run each other over with pallets full of soda bottles. 3. ""Alleged robber asks victim out for date"" After two men robbed a Domino's Pizza delivery woman, one of them called the victim from his cell phone to apologize -- and to ask her out. 4. ""Four women fired for gossiping"" Four women employed in a small New Hampshire town were fired for gossiping about a relationship between the town administrator and a fellow co-worker. They were fired on the basis that ""gossip, whispering and an unfriendly environment are causing poor morale and interfering with the efficient performance of town business."" 5. ""Eau de Lawsuit: Woman sues over scent"" An employee in the Detroit planning department sued the city, saying a female co-worker's strong fragrance prohibited her from working. The woman claimed she is severely sensitive to perfumes and her co-worker not only wore a strong scent, but also plugged in a scented room deodorizer. 6. ""Salt lands McDonald's employee in jail"" A McDonald's employee was arrested, jailed and is facing criminal charges because a police officer got sick after a hamburger he ate was too salty. The employee accidentally spilled salt on some hamburger meat and told her supervisor and co-worker, who ""tried to thump the salt off."" The employee was charged because she served the burger ""without regards to the well-being of anyone who might consume it."" 7. ""Carpenter free to ply trade in the nude"" A carpenter caught hammering nails and sawing wood in the nude says he prefers working in the buff because it's more comfortable and helps keep his clothes clean. The carpenter was found not guilty of indecent exposure. 8. ""Southwest Airlines employee tells passenger her outfit won't fly"" A Southwest employee asked a young woman in a short skirt to leave the airplane, saying she was dressed too provocatively for the family airline. The young woman was eventually allowed to complete her trip after covering up. On her return flight, she came home with no problem -- in the same outfit. 9. ""Employee accused of faking being cop"" A Taco Bell employee was arrested for impersonating a law enforcement officer and attempting to arrest his managers and co-worker. He passed himself off as an undercover narcotics investigator, going as far as typing fake criminal histories on the general manager, two shift managers and an employee and telling them they were going to be arrested. 10. ""Employee took 1 million screws home from factory"" An assembly worker hid screws in a specially designed hiding place and took up to 7,000 home with him every day. Over a two-year period, he stole more than 1.1 million screws with an estimated value of $155,000. He allegedly sold the screws over the Internet at discount prices. 11. ""Deputy nabbed twice for DUI -- by husband"" An off-duty jail deputy was pulled over and charged with driving under the influence -- by her husband, a fellow deputy. She supposedly left before he could give her a Breathalyzer test, so he pulled her over again and called for backup. She was placed on administrative leave. 12. ""Workers killed after seeking raises"" A car dealership owner killed two employees because they kept asking for more pay. The employer told police he was having financial problems and was under a lot of stress. 13. ""Man demands coupons from radio station employee"" A radio station employee was threatened at gunpoint when an angry patron was unhappy with the promotional bumper stickers he received. The patron demanded McDonald's coupons instead; when the employee didn't have any, the man flashed what looked like a handgun. She searched her car and found a coupon for a free cheeseburger. The man took it, made a derogatory comment about the radio station and rode away on his bike. 14. ""Wienermobile gets cop roasted"" When a 27-foot-long, 11-foot-tall vehicle -- known to most as the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile -- was slowing traffic in a construction zone in Arizona, an officer ran its ""YUMMY"" license plate to make sure it was street legal. A bad computer entry erroneously showed the Wienermobile as having stolen plates, forcing the officer to pull it over. After further investigation, the officer learned that the entry should have read that license plate had been stolen -- but only if found on any vehicle that isn't a giant hot dog. 15. ""Drive-through dispute gets suspect jail food"" Workers at a Burger King in New York got into a dispute with a customer after he refused to turn his music down while ordering at the drive-through. The customer grabbed the restaurant's manager, tried to pull her through a window and then attempted to run over a worker who came to help the manager. E-mail to a friend .

"Havana (CNN) -- The death toll from a batch of poisoned, bootleg rum climbed to nine people, Cuban state TV said Thursday. Another 59 people were still hospitalized from drinking the toxic liquor, and five were released after treatment, a government newscaster said. Late Monday, Havana hospitals were flooded with people complaining of dizziness and stomach ailments, a statement from the provincial public safety office said. Authorities said they appeared to have consumed a black-market rum brewed with toxic methyl alcohol, commonly found in varnishes and anti-freeze. On a Cuban state TV newscast, doctors said most of the patients were slowly recovering, including those who had temporarily lost their vision from drinking the poisoned rum. ""The vomiting has stopped and so has the great sickness they felt,"" said Dr. Efren Acosta. But Acosta said many patients still suffered from dizziness. Patients interviewed by Cuban state media said they experienced blurred vision and nausea after one drink of what they described as an acrid tasting liquid. They said they sought treatment upon hearing that neighbors and friends had fallen ill. ""I couldn't see,"" Sandy Pons told Cuban government television. ""It was all foggy. The headaches and dizziness are gone now."" According to the provincial public safety office, investigators traced the illegal alcohol sales to two workers for the government Pharmacy and Foods Institute. Authorities accuse them of stealing the chemicals from a government warehouse. The workers provided the chemicals to a woman who brewed the alcohol and sold it in her neighborhood, the public safety office said. Cuban authorities have not said what charges the people involved in producing the liquor could face, but Cuban President Raul Castro last month called for a greater crackdown on corruption and black market activities.","Poisoned rum brewed in Havana neighborhood claims nine lives, state media say .

"(CNN) -- At long last, the royal baby has arrived! The queen can finally depart for her summer holiday at Balmoral. The paparazzi who have been littering the streets in front of St. Mary's Hospital can now train their long lenses on a topless (albeit nursing) mother. To Kate and William, I pass on the most consoling words I received when my daughter was born: The first month of parenthood isn't for the faint-hearted. Everyone's got advice for new parents. The French -- we are told -- raise happier and better-behaved children, thanks to their self-assured authority and bans on snacking. Tiger moms, so the legend goes, breed successful children because of rigorous discipline and unflinchingly high standards. Gwyneth Paltrow's children prosper because they are deprived of carbohydrates. But in a clamorous field of conflicting advice-givers, the members of Britain's royal family are notable no-shows. While many have an opinion about how the new royal baby should be brought up -- nanny or no nanny, Charles and Camilla or the Middletons holding grandparently sway -- there is no volley answering back from the Palace. Little wonder, since a Royal Guide to Parenting sounds like a Monty Python skit, with the dotty royal ancestors alternately misplacing their progeny and browbeating them for breaches of arcane infant protocol. 'Wicked' author: Royal baby stands for hope . It's not that royal parents lack a plan. Kate and Prince William reportedly want a ""normal"" childhood for their offspring. Prince William's mother, Diana, said the same thing. For Diana, that meant unscheduled playtimes, the occasional meal at McDonald's, nursery school with other children. But if a trip for the royal heirs to Disney World was a novelty, the longing for ordinariness -- or seeming ordinariness -- is in fact a much older aspiration. It was Prince William's great-great-great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria and her German consort, Prince Albert, who recognized the adulation that might be inspired by a royal family (the term was Albert's own coinage) cast in the mold of middle-class virtues. Unlike her dissipated uncles, Victoria and her family would be paragons of bourgeois domesticity. Albert was present at the birth of his children. The education of Bertie, their second-born son and heir, was approached with the utmost seriousness. Distrustful of the lax and inattentive royal parents of the past, Albert elected to superintend every detail of Bertie's upbringing himself. Opinion: Why I wouldn't want to be royal baby . Still, all of this parental care came, as Jane Ridley's fascinating new biography of Edward VII reveals, at a high price. Bertie could never live up to his parents' expectations of him. He was rebellious, a slow learner and -- or so his father feared -- marked by the congenital weaknesses in Victoria's line. In the hope of instilling regular habits, Albert spied on his son constantly. Both of his parents issued a constant stream of corrections, Tiger Mothers before the fact. ""I had no boyhood,"" Bertie later lamented. From Victoria and Albert onwards, contemporary claims to normality and ordinariness jostle up against retrospective assessments of secrecy and isolation. Was Charles' father, Prince Philip, really doing a ""splendidly modern job on the upbringing of his son,"" as the Daily Mirror reported when Charles was 13: ""No effete, out-dated Eton, with its tailcoats, fancy waistcoats, slender watch chains and high-pitched accents""? Or was young Prince Charles, as is now often suggested, the hapless victim of distant parents who subjected him to an education unsuited to his personality? Opinion: Baby helps make a monarchy better . As Prince Albert presciently recognized, family life does provide common ground, even a point of identification and sympathy, between royals and their subjects. While few live in a castle, the vast majority of us have parents of some sort. But contrary to Albert's fond hopes, the royal family has proved itself most normal in the late 20th century not by exemplifying middle-class virtues but by enacting the same fallout from the sexual revolution as most other Western families: adultery, divorce, confession and intergenerational conflict. That sort of normality, however, doesn't endear you to taxpayers. For extraordinary people to make themselves ordinary is a conjuring act, one that requires a certain suspension of disbelief on the part of their audience. It's role-playing on our part as well as theirs. So, Kate and William: We wish you many perfectly ordinary sleepless nights, changing diapers and worrying over test scores. But we'll only know you're really normal when you tell the rest of us how to raise a baby -- and, on the basis of results achieved, some are willing to listen. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Deborah Cohen.","The Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to a boy on Monday .

"Mordovia, Russia (CNN) -- It takes a seven-hour drive east from Moscow to get to the prison camps of Mordovia. Convicted criminals fear the place. It is grim, decaying and intimidating. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, a member of the Russian punk rock collective Pussy Riot, was sent to Mordovia last year for her part in a performance of a ""punk prayer"" critical of Vladimir Putin -- then the prime minister, now the president -- at a Russian Orthodox cathedral. Found guilty of hooliganism, Tolokonnikova, 23, was sentenced to two years in the penal colony. She has less than six months left on her sentence. But on September 23, she declared the conditions at the prison to be intolerable and began a hunger strike. 'Slave labor' In a lengthy letter to the news site Lenta (a translated version was published in London's The Guardian), Tolokonnikova described ""slave labor"" and unsanitary conditions in which women work through sickness and injury up to 17 hours a day and are beaten -- or worse -- for failing to complete their duties. After several days without water, she became so weak that doctors ordered that she be placed in the penal colony's medical ward on Friday. Four days later, she ended the hunger strike, said Pyotr Verzilov, her husband. But Tolokonnikova will resume her protest if conditions at the prison camp don't improve, he said. She had started developing complications because of the length of the hunger strike, Verzilov said. Prison authorities have denied Tolokonnikova's allegations about the situation at the penal colony, accusing her of lying. A similar experience . But Svetlana Bakhmina believes every word because she says she lived through a similar experience. Bakhmina was convicted of embezzlement and served three years in a Mordovia prison camp. ""It's like torture,"" she said. ""The system between the administration and the convicts is not just based on subordination, but humiliation, fear, intimidation and physical force."" Bakhmina said she also went on a hunger strike after authorities said she could no longer phone her children. She said the psychological pressure applied to make her quit was harder than the hunger. Maria Alyokhina, another convicted member of Pussy Riot, went on a hunger strike earlier this year, protesting conditions in a different remote prison camp. She drew attention and won concessions. Tolokonnikova is waiting to discover if she has done the same.","Tolokonnikova began her hunger strike to protest prison conditions .

"(CNN) -- As media outlets flourish, and attention spans shrink to hashtag-sized dimensions, advertisers have had to get increasingly creative with how they deliver messages to the masses. Many brand ambassadors have found salvation in an unexpected source: the airport. ""The individuals that are passing through generally will have an above-average income, they're disproportionally more likely to be carrying a smart phone or tablet, and they're very much in a captive environment. They're basically the sort of people advertisers are striving to get a hold of,"" explains Steve Cox, the managing director of JCDecaux's UK airport division. In July, Heineken utilized John F. Kennedy Airport in New York as part of their wider, ongoing ""Dropped"" campaign. A ""Departure Roulette"" board was set up at Terminal 8, and passengers were invited to drop their current travel plans to be shipped off to an unknown, more exotic destination instead. The stunt, conceived by Wieden + Kennedy, coincided with TV ads and a Heineken-branded YouTube series. Video: Is sharing the new way to travel? ""The airport really lent itself to this campaign,"" says Erik Norin, creative director at Wieden + Kennedy. ""People are more stressed out at the airport than at any other time, and they're about to totally surrender to an airline. They're looking for a distraction. For us, it's really the perfect storm."" Departure Roulette not only attracted the attention of the national and international media, but footage from the installation garnered over 2.5 million hits on YouTube. Norin notes that airports are a gateway to travel, and for that reason seem to capture the public imagination like few other venues. It is for this reason, perhaps, that airport marketing campaigns are apt to go viral, adding an extra element of success. ""When people are traveling, whether for business or leisure, they will share their experiences -- especially if it's a memorable experience that touches them or wows them,"" explains Henry Mason, the global head of research and a managing partner at TrendWatching.com. ""For that reason, campaigns that center around the airport can reach a much wider audience, one that goes beyond the physical reach of the airport itself."" Read more: Place your bids for an upgrade . Another campaign that was particularly adept at wowing passengers this year was a Douwe Egberts-branded coffee vending machine placed in South Africa's OR Tambo International Airport. The machine was yawn-activated, and rewarded passengers who could figure out its mechanism with a free cup of coffee. Like Departure Roulette, the campaign garnered thousands of YouTube hits and Twitter buzz. Pepe Marais, the chief creative officer at Joe Public, the firm that came up with the install, notes that the one-day interaction was relatively inexpensive, but had a big payoff. ""Douwe Egberts don't have a big budget. We spent about $22,000 on development of the machine, and the seeding costs on Twitter. It went out to about six million followers, and just went mad,"" he recalls.","Big brands like Microsoft and Heineken, roll out innovative campaigns at airports.
Airports have a captive audience of customers with a disposable income.
It's important that airport marketing be experiential -- to match travelers' frame of mind.

"(CNN) -- An Alitalia aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing at Rome's Fiumicino airport on Sunday night after landing gear failed to function, Italy's state-run ANSA news agency reported. The pilots made several attempts to land the aircraft, an Airbus A320, which was flying to the Italian capital from Madrid. A foam path was used to assist with the landing. The plane did not skid off the runway and none of the 151 passengers on board were injured. A picture taken by Instagram user Andrea Ugolini showed the aircraft tilted to one side while passengers were evacuated using the emergency exit above the wing. ANSA said that passengers clapped and congratulated the pilot, who had more than 15,000 hours of flying experience and had previously worked in the military. Two investigators have been sent to the scene to determine the cause of the equipment failure. Journalists Sophie Brown and Katie Hunt in Hong Kong contributed reporting .","Alitalia aircraft makes emergency landing after equipment failure .

"(CNN) -- The love of money may be the root of all evil according to the Bible, but that hasn't stopped bookmakers from offering odds on who will emerge from the white smoke as the next pope. At odds as low as 2-1, Cardinal Angelo Scola, the archbishop of Milan, is the bookmakers' favorite to succeed Benedict XVI, who Thursday becomes the first pope to step down for almost 600 years. Those betting an African will take the Catholic Church's top job for the first time will be happy to hear Ghana's Cardinal Peter Turkson is running a close second at 5-2, while Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican Secretary of State, is currently running third with odds of 3-1. MORE: Conclave to elect new pope starts Tuesday . Claire Davies, a spokeswoman at Irish bookmaker Paddy Power, said more than √Ç¬£300,000 ($450,000) in bets on the next pope have been placed since Benedict's resignation -- and that's before the papal conclave to choose the next church head has even started. ""It's our biggest non-sporting event of the year,"" Davies told CNN, ""and we expect the betting to really pick up as we head towards the conclave."" Canadian Cardinal Marc Ouellet and Brazilian Cardinal Odilo Scherer round out Paddy Power's top five -- and though betting on the next pope is illegal in the U.S., the Irish bookmaker is offering 20-1 odds on Cardinal Timothy Dolan, America's top Catholic. But Vatican insiders aren't the only prospective pontiffs punters can wager on in the hopes that a puff of white smoke will finally put their bank accounts into the black. Davies says nine more bets have been placed on Father Dougal Maguire -- the dimwitted fictional priest from Irish television sitcom ""Father Ted"" and a 10,000-1 underdog -- than for Claudio Hummes, a Brazilian cardinal who also has the added benefit of being a real person. Paddy Power says it has also drawn 20 bets at 1,000-1 that U2 singer Bono will be the next pope, and another five on Richard Dawkins, the famously outspoken atheist and scientist, at an ominous 666-1. One British bookmaker is even offering 10,000-1 odds that disgraced American cyclist Lance Armstrong will be chosen to head up the church. But the bookies' odds aren't necessarily the best indicator of who the next pope will be, and a phrase repeated by Cardinal Javier Barragan of Mexico is worth remembering: ""He who enters the conclave as a possible pope comes out a cardinal."" According to Davies, Pope Benedict was 20-1 after his predecessor's death in 2005 before rising to 6-1 at the start of the conclave -- ""up with the favorites, but not a nailed-on certainty."" While the next pope will almost certainly be chosen from among the cardinals set to attend the conclave at the Vatican within the next few weeks, technically any practicing Catholic can be elected to lead the church.

"(CNN) -- I've always found amusement parks very unamusing, for it's hard to justify standing in a hot, 40-minute roller-coaster line so I can promptly lose my car keys and barf up a churro. That's what whiskey is for. But lots of people dig this kind of entertainment. And it seems all the theme parks around the world try to out-amuse each other with technologically advanced new rides promising wild and exciting fun. ""Hey kids! Come try The Agonizer! It will literally give you second-degree steam burns to the face!"" You see, when it comes to roller coasters these days, they have to be super-√É¬ºber extreme to stand out. And, right now, thrill seekers on the Web are all talking about Full Throttle at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Southern California. The ride opened last weekend to rave reviews, and it's being touted as the ""world's tallest and fastest looping coaster."" Which sounds pretty amazing, save for the part about it being tall and fast and looping. My ideal roller coaster is a hammock. Nevertheless, this thing goes up to 70 mph, reaches a height of 160 feet and uses something called a linear synchronous-motor magnetic launch system. I don't know what that means, but I'm fairly certain it causes diarrhea. ""Did anybody else just ...?"" ""Yes. Get the kids. We're going home."" Full Throttle also prides itself on having the world's first ever ""top hat"" loop, allowing riders to fly across the outer rail of the circle as well as the inside. Everything I've read suggests that this is actually a rather big deal when it comes to roller-coaster engineering. Though, to be fair, I'm still trying to figure out button-fly jeans. So, in my book, pretty much anything more sophisticated than a ballpoint pen counts as an major scientific accomplishment. Hell, my ceiling fan is certifiably magic. Anyway, never mind all the wild technology. Just know that Full Throttle is really big and really fast, and if the train ever flies off the rails, there's a pretty good chance you'll end up somewhere near Pittsburgh. ""Ha-ha. Now that's what I call being thrown for a loop!"" ""Shut up, Dave."" And if the overall speed and height weren't wild enough, Full Throttle also minimizes the protective harnessing that prevents you from dropping painfully to your death. Which, to some, might be slightly concerning. Here, there's nothing covering your chest -- just a simple lap bar to keep you and your bladder snugly in position. But it's said to be very advanced, and the limited upper-body protection totally enhances the fear factor when, at one point during the ride, you apparently almost slow to a stop along a curve. It's a terrifying pause that lasts just long enough to make a deathbed confession to the stranger sitting next to you. ""Hi. I'm Jim. I like Nickelback."" These are the dirty secrets we share when roller-coaster technology rises to the next level. Tim Burkhart, director of maintenance, construction and engineering for Six Flags Magic Mountain, was the project lead for creating Full Throttle, and told Theme Park Insider that, ""Anyone can take a track and flip it. I've done it a million times -- it's easy to do. But to build an actual loop, with all the supporting structure, and the dynamics you have to do to be at 160 feet, that is a much (more) difficult thing."" If this all sounds completely amazing, it is. Roller-coaster engineering continues to test the limits of your lunch, and Six Flags Magic Mountain has quite literally raised the bar. So, if you're an adrenaline junkie and you make it out to California, make sure you head over to Six Flags to give this thing a shot. Do it for me. Because I'll be in my hammock, confidently eating a churro.","Full Throttle coaster goes 70 mph and up to 160 feet in the air .

"(CNN)  -- Before I explain why I believe the time has come to start a stop-the-war movement, I should say that I am not one of those intellectuals who has never worried about the fate of their loved ones or gotten his own boots dirty. My son completed a five-year stint in the U.S. 1st Armored Division. As an Israeli commando, I saw a lot of fighting during Israel's war for independence. My unit started fighting with 1,100 members; when the fighting stopped, 700 were dead and buried or wounded. And we killed all too many on the other side. I abhor war and believe we should fight only when there is a clear and present danger, when all other means for resolving a conflict have been truly exhausted and to protect the innocent. Those are the three criteria of a just war. The war in Afghanistan used to meet these criteria. It no longer does. We invaded Afghanistan to stop it from serving as a base for terrorists of the kind who attacked us on 9/11. This goal has been accomplished. Fewer than 100 members of al Qaeda are in Afghanistan. There are many more in Yemen and Somalia, which we are not planning to invade. The Taliban has no designs on us, beyond making us leave. After that, the people of Afghanistan can duke it out over which kind of regime they want. If the majority of the Afghan people don't want the Taliban to rule, they should fight for their rights, as they have shown they can when they defeated the Taliban in 2002 with limited help from us. Some claim that we must keep fighting to secure human rights, especially women's rights, and a democratic regime in Afghanistan. However, nothing indicates that we can accomplish in this godforsaken 12th-century country what we did in Germany and Japan after World War II. See more opinion articles at CNN.com . The metrics that the U.S. Army keeps inventing to show progress are pitiful. Having committed 100,000 troops and a similar number of ""private"" contractors against rag-tag, poorly equipped, illiterate locals, we captured a few scores of square miles, opened a few markets and a local government or two. But large and growing areas of Afghanistan are under Taliban control. We should neither die nor kill for an illusion. Sometimes, a minor news item highlights a much greater issue. A recent report from an embedded reporter for GlobalPost shows a 19-year-old American soldier getting shot in the head -- his helmet saved him from death -- as his unit traveled through Kunar Province in late August. They were surveying polling sites for the upcoming elections. Also, a homemade bomb, called an IED, damaged and set afire the lead vehicle of this small convoy and severely wounded its driver. It seemed absurd to risk lives of Americans, our allies or Afghans to support faux elections. In many parts of the country, ballot stations could not be opened. In others, massive fraud took place. Adding insult to injury, we congratulated the Afghan government on holding ""successful"" elections. That way, we did not have to admit to the world and each other that whatever the Karzai government is -- one of the most corrupt governments in the world, a foundation of a new narcostate -- democracy it ain't, by a long shot. How much our entanglement in Afghanistan is turning into a sad farce became all too clear when President Obama flew to Kabul to tell Karzai that he ought to stop corruption. When, in response, Karzai started negotiating a peace deal with the Taliban, the White House rolled out the red carpet for Karzai and announced that from now on, the U.S. will focus on low-level corruption. Moreover, it turns out that major sources of corruption are our corporations and the CIA. It's time to bring our troops home. To encourage our president and Congress to withdraw the troops, let's fasten to our lapels white ribbons (for peace) with black letters (mourning those who died) that read ""Bring them home."" The time has come to organize teach-ins and antiwar groups. Instead of another march on Washington, let there be rallies across America. Bring the troops home. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Amitai Etzioni.","Amitai Etzioni was Israeli commando, son served in U.S. 1st Armored Division .

"(CNN) -- Indecisive foodies have another tool to help them find top-notch eating and drinking destinations. Google on Monday overhauled the Zagat.com website and released new, free Zagat mobile apps for Android and iOS. Until now, Zagat required people to login to access the reviews. With this overhaul, Google is making Zagat content free and accessible to everyone without having to sign up. Google purchased the restaurant-review company in 2011 and added its database of reviews to existing Google services like Google Maps and Google Plus in 2012. Zagat ratings score dining, hotel and other entertainment venues on a scale of one to 30. They haven't replaced Google's own Yelp-like scoring system, which assigns locations a one- to five-star rating based on user reviews in Google Plus. Those scores currently show up in Google.com search results. Zagat competes with other review databases such as Yelp and Foursquare. Unlike those crowd-sourced rankings, Zagat still relies on a slightly older, less-freewheeling model. It collects information about the places it rates using surveys and then tallies the results for the final scores. The new Zagat has four categories of content. There are listings for individual places that bear the familiar one-paragraph summary and ratings for food, decor, service and an average cost. There is also original content put together by local editors in the form of lists, blog posts (called ""Buzz"") and videos. The revamped Zagat site and apps only cover restaurants and nightlife in nine cities to start, but Google says it will add 50 locations in the coming months. It also plans to add in results for other types of destinations, including stores, hotels and places of interest. For now, anyone living in or visiting Austin, Boston, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco or Washington can use the tools to choose an adventure.","Google releases a revamped Zagat site and apps on Monday .

"(CNN) -- A Texas judge rebuffed a request to step aside Thursday and opened a hearing into allegations that a man executed for the killings of his three daughters was put on death row by ""junk science."" The family of Cameron Todd Willingham has asked District Judge Charlie Baird to posthumously clear Willingham's name, arguing that state officials ignored an expert's last-minute findings that the fire that killed his daughters in December 1991 was not deliberately set. The science that supported the prosecution's case ""had been discredited 10 years earlier,"" Gerry Goldstein, a lawyer for the family, told the judge. Willingham was put to death in February 2004, insisting in his final statement that he was innocent. Authorities in the town of Corsicana, where the fire took place, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who allowed the execution to go forward, have stood by the conviction. Navarro County District Attorney Lowell Thompson last week asked Baird to step aside. Thompson argued that the judge's impartiality was called into question by the fact that he sat on the state Court of Criminal Appeals when it upheld Willingham's conviction and wrote a concurring opinion supporting the ruling. In addition, he argued, Baird received an award in February from the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. Baird rejected Thompson's motion Thursday, finding that the prosecutor's office was not a party to the family's request for a ""court of inquiry,"" a rare proceeding under Texas law. ""I just don't believe that you, in your capacity as the Navarro County district attorney, are a part of this lawsuit,"" Baird said. Thompson left the courtroom after the ruling without participating in Thursday's hearing, which was held to determine whether there is enough evidence of a wrongful conviction to open a court of inquiry. The proceedings are separate from the long-running investigation being conducted by the Texas Forensic Science Commission, which is scheduled to take up the Willingham case again Friday. Willingham's relatives have the support of The Innocence Project, which requested the Forensic Science Commission's investigation. The group's founder, defense lawyer Barry Scheck, appeared in court Thursday to argue for a court of inquiry, telling Baird the testimony of a state fire marshal who was the prosecution's key witness was ""completely wrong and misleading."" The fire marshal, Manuel Vasquez, told jurors in Willingham's trial that evidence at the scene of the fire showed the blaze was set intentionally with a flammable liquid. ""Given the science that we know today,"" Scheck said, that testimony is ""false, misleading and totally unreliable."" Fire scientist John Lentini, who reviewed the Willingham case after the execution, told Baird that some of the indicators Vasquez relied on to reach his conclusions were outdated at the time -- and nearly all were considered obsolete by the time Willingham was executed. ""A lot of people believed that back in 1991,"" Lentini said. ""Now in 2004, nobody believed that."" Vasquez died in the mid-1990s, but the state fire marshal's office has reaffirmed his findings -- a stance Lentini said was impossible to square with modern fire science. ""You can't make it go away just by saying, 'We stand by the original conclusions,' "" he said. Willingham's daughters -- 2-year-old Amber and 1-year-old twins Karmon and Kameron -- died in the blaze in Corsicana, south of Dallas. His ex-wife, Stacy Kuykendall, told reporters outside the Austin courthouse last week that Willingham had confessed to her in the days before his execution that he had started the fatal fire. ""He burnt them,"" Kuykendall said. ""He admitted he burnt them to me, and he was convicted for his crime. That is the closest to justice that my daughters will ever get."" Willingham never publicly admitted guilt, and his family has questioned Kuykendall's account of the confession. Baird said Kuykendall was invited to appear at Thursday's hearing, but she declined.","Key arson testimony in trial was ""completely wrong,"" lawyer says .

"(CNN)  -- Work hard, play hard. In Seoul, it's easy to do both. The city's metro area is home to roughly 20 million residents, whose penchant for working long hours has helped transform the country into an economic power in the last half-century. When the capital city's residents need a break, there's a host of options open to them. Seoul is bursting with cultural events, a buzzing nightlife and lively eating spots. The once-grim industrial megacity is looking towards the future -- an ambitious urban regeneration drive has helped it earn the designation of World Design Capital this year -- but the rich cultural heritage of its past is also at your fingertips. Frequent CNNGo contributor Gregory Curley has lived in Seoul since 2002. He didn't intend to stay for more than a year, but eight years on, he's still transfixed. He revealed what life is like in the city. CNN: What's the vibe like? Gregory Curley: It's very cosmopolitan. It's very large and very fast paced. It's hectic but exciting at the same time, and extremely dynamic. It actually never sleeps. I really mean that. It's not that things never seem to shut down, there's always something happening. CNN: What are your favorite districts? GC: Bukchon -- for the area's numerous traditional hanok homes. Insadong -- for its cozy tea houses and abundant traditional knick-knack shops. Namdaemun and Noryangjin Market -- the former boasting a huge outdoor sprawl of every imaginable good and the latter being one of Korea's largest fish markets. Garosugil -- great tree-lined street replete with shops and Euro-style cafes and restaurants. CNN: What are some other highlights? GC: The five grand palaces are a must-see. They give you an idea of the historical side of Korea and what life was like thousands of years ago. Namsan Mountain is very scenic. It's a great place to grab great views of the city. There's a cable car that runs right to the top of the mountain. It's especially beautiful during fall. At the base of the mountain there's also a nice traditional folk village called Namsangol. CNN: Where and what do you like to eat? GC: Because I love markets I would have to say Gwangjang Market, which is a huge, outdoor market. You can literally get anything there. My favorite dish is a spicy chicken dish called dak tori tang. It's fantastic. But also a huge favorite of mine is Korean barbeque. Food has a very important place in Korean culture -- not only in the manner in which it is prepared, but also in the way it is consumed. Restaurants are social playgrounds. I have many memories of being huddled around a table cooking marinated meats and drinking soju amongst friends. CNN: Seoul is undergoing some major design changes. Do you have a favorite public space? GC: With regard to design, there's definitely a lot happening now. The Digital City is going to be opening up soon. Songdo near Incheon Airport is quite amazing, too. CNN: Do you have any favorite or lasting memories? GC: My friend was one of the organizers of the Pentaport Rock Festival. Amazing time. And quite possibly one of my fondest memories in Korea. CNN: Where do you like to go to get away? GC: Exploring the country outside of Seoul is a great way to get to the heart of Korean culture. If you drive straight east from Seoul you reach Donghae, which is quite picturesque. The area's great for seafood and swimming. My favorite beach along the east coast is Naksan Beach (in the north, just south of Donghae) and Chilpo Beach (in the south, just north of Pohang). Donghae is great because it has that coastal charm -- a very laid back atmosphere with friendly folk and fantastic seafood. Have you been to Seoul or do you live there?

"(CNN) -- A decade after Angola emerged from devastating civil war, the sea front road that winds around the bay of its capital, Luanda, is now dotted with multi-million dollar condominiums, exclusive clubs, and boutique stores catering for the country's elite. Most of Luanda's population, however, live in the nearby slums, where health facilities are non-existent and children must work, not study, to survive. Africa's natural resource wealth has certainly fueled a decade of rapid growth, but most Africans have still not seen the benefits. More urgently, rapid population growth combined with deepening inequality could one day prove explosive. It does not have to be this way, of course. Botswana successfully used its diamond wealth to develop quickly, growing from one of Africa's poorest countries at independence in 1966 to become a democratic, stable, and upper middle-income country. But countries such as Ghana and Liberia have also made impressive strides towards better natural resource management in recent years. With surging global demand keeping export prices high and new exploration revealing larger reserves than were previously known, Africa stands to reap a windfall from its natural resources. The challenge is to translate this wealth into meaningful benefit for African citizens. Find out more: How Africa's resources fuel the world . This year's Africa Progress Report, ""Equity in Extractives: Stewarding Africa's natural resources for all,"" recommends policies so that more Africans can benefit from the minerals under their soil and coastal waters. Among our recommendations for African policy makers, the international community, and the private sector, five major themes emerge. First, from revenue flows to company ownership, transparency is critical because it reduces the opportunity for corruption. International initiatives, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), have brought serious progress, and African governments such as Guinea, Liberia, and Ghana are increasingly publishing contract details online. But there is still plenty of work to be done. The international community must do more to tackle the issues of money laundering and anonymous shell companies, which facilitate corruption by hiding the true recipients of corrupt payments. This is a global challenge which requires multilateral solutions. Our report analyzed five recent deals, for example, which cost the Democratic Republic of the Congo an estimated US$1.36 billion through the systematic undervaluation and sale of nationally owned mineral assets to unknown buyers. These losses were equal to more than double the combined 2012 budget for health and education in a country that has some of the world's worst malnutrition, its sixth highest child mortality rate, and over seven million children out of school. Read this: Where is Angola's oil money? These issues may have been on this year's G8 political agenda, but G8 leaders did little to legislate against anonymous company ownership in their jurisdictions. The world will be watching Australia's G20 leadership next year for meaningful progress on this issue. Second, African countries must secure a fairer share of natural resource revenues for their citizens. Africa has too often received an unfair return on its mineral resources. At the beginning of this century, for example, half a million Zambians in the mining sector were paying a higher tax rate than the multinational companies they were working for. Inevitably, some African governments have been at a natural disadvantage when negotiating with companies whose experience stretches over many decades and different continents too. But fairer deals can be good for multinationals. Companies prefer a stable business environment and fairer deals tend to last much longer. Third, African governments must spend their natural resource revenue more effectively on poverty reduction. Between 2000 and 2011, for example, Equatorial Guinea grew an average 17 percent per year, making it the fastest growing economy in the world and propelling it into the league of high-income countries. But three quarters of its population still live in poverty and its child mortality rates are among the highest in the world. By using resource flows to eliminate malnutrition, African policymakers could eliminate the greatest barrier to Africa's social and economic progress, which blights the lives of 40 percent of Africa's children. Fourth, the international community must tackle tax avoidance and evasion, especially relevant for Africa's oil, gas, and mineral sectors. Read this: World's biggest dam to light up Africa? As we said in our report, Africa still loses more money each year through tax avoidance than it receives in either international aid or foreign direct investment. But the examples of Amazon, Google, and Starbucks show G8 policy agenda aligns with an African agenda too. Throughout the world, governments and citizens will all benefit from tackling tax evasion and avoidance. Fifth, African policy makers must grasp this opportunity to create more jobs. Oil, gas, and mining don't create large amounts of jobs per se, but job creation is a critical issue for Africa, which has one of the world's fastest growing populations. Governments must require extractive companies to procure more goods and services locally. But policy makers can also use extractive industries as a base for diversifying their economies. We are upbeat about Africa's prospects. Not only do we see democracy taking root across the continent and much stronger economic governance, we also see more commitment from multinationals to contribute to society. Ultimately, it is in all our interests that Africa succeeds. We all benefit from an Africa that is prosperous, fair, and stable. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Caroline Kende-Robb.","Africa stands to reap a windfall from its resources, says Caroline Kende-Robb .

"(CNN) -- It was Sunday morning that a fire broke out in the engine room on the Carnival Triumph, leaving the ship adrift in the Gulf of Mexico. The vessel eased into port Thursday night. Why did it take five days to rescue the 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew members on board? The answer is not simple. It involves a handful of big decisions and some environmental factors outside anyone's control. Here are three reasons why the process has taken as long as it has: . 1. Carnival Cruise Lines decided to tow the ship back to port. Citing safety concerns, the company opted to tow the ship, rather than move passengers to another vessel. ""We evaluated a wide range of options including using another ship to transport guests, but the safest solution was towing the ship back to port. We have a huge team involving multiple departments working around the clock to get our guests home as quickly as possible,"" Carnival said on its Facebook page. Spokesman Vance Gulliksen elaborated in an e-mail. See photos, tweets from the ship . ""Regarding why we didn't use another cruise ship, we checked on this and all of our ships are in service right now, meaning that there aren't enough cabins available to accommodate more than 3,100 guests who are currently on the Triumph. Additionally, a ship-to-ship transfer at sea would be considered too risky,"" he said. My celebration trip on the Carnival Triumph: From joy to misery . 2. Strong currents pushed the ship north, prompting the company to change where the Carnival Triumph would dock. After deciding the ship had to be towed, the cruise company chose as its destination the closest port, which was then Progreso, Mexico. But soon after the decision was made, and before tugboats could take control, strong currents nudged the ship some 90 miles north, putting it nearly as close to Mobile, Alabama, as to Progreso. Not so easy to sue cruise line . ""Given the strength of the currents, it is preferable to head north to Mobile, rather than attempt to tow against them,"" the company said on its Facebook page. The U.S. port had another advantage. It provided easier re-entry for passengers and crew, particularly for the roughly 900 guests on board traveling without passports, Carnival said. Tears, big hugs as passengers reunite . 3. The sheer size of the task is staggering. The Carnival Triumph is a beast of a ship. It is 14 stories, nearly 900 feet long and is carrying more than 4,000 people. Moving it anywhere takes a tremendous amount of time, energy and calculation. It traveled up a channel Thursday toward Mobile, a process that typically takes two to three hours. But because tugboats go slower than ships sailing at their normal speeds, that same trip was expected to take seven to 10 hours, said Gulliksen, the Carnival spokesman. Five things we've learned about cruising . The journey was further delayed for four hours when the towline from the lead tugboat to the ship snapped, and another tug pushing the ship broke a bit. Even once the ship docked, Carnival officials said it would take four to five hours to get everyone off, which will likely seem like an eternity to those waiting to see loved ones. ""We have to clear all of the decks, section by section, with first priority to guests with special needs and children,"" said Gulliksen. ""The entire process is quite involved, given that there are more than 3,100 passengers and nearly 1,100 crew, and this is compounded by the ship only operating on emergency power,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The mainland United States, which was largely recovering Monday from a near-nationwide heat wave, has experienced the warmest 12 months since record-keeping began in 1895, a top government science and weather agency announced Monday. The report from the National Climatic Data Center, which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, does not take into account blistering heat from this month, with 2,116 high temperature marks either broken or tied between July 2 and July 8 in communities nationwide. Share your heat photos and videos on CNN iReport . But it does incorporate the warmest March recorded as well as extreme heat in June, which also helped make the first six months of 2012 the warmest recorded of any January-June stretch. In the last half of June, 170 all-time temperature records were matched or smashed in cities across the lower 48 states. The U.S. State Climate Extremes Committee also is reviewing whether 113-degree temperatures in South Carolina and 112-degree recordings in Georgia qualify as all-time records in those two states. Southwest heats up as rest of U.S. cools down . ""There are a lot of things going on that have been very unusual over the last several months,"" said Dev Niyogi, earth and atmospheric sciences professor at Purdue University. That includes an outbreak of particularly large wildfires in Colorado, which had its warmest June ever, according to NOAA. Most of that state is experiencing extreme to exceptional drought, which is also true in places as far afield as Arizona and Georgia, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, run out of the University of Nebraska. That's a pressing problem in Indiana, where Niyogi is the state climatologist and where the National Weather Service says conditions in central and southern parts of the state ""resemble the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s."" Niyogi said it is ""very hard to root out"" the role played by short-term weather patterns and longer-term trends in creating conditions recorded over a given stretch, such as the period from June 2011 to June 2012 measured by NOAA. But he said, ""They're all tied together"" and can contribute to major issues, pointing specifically to the interdependent relationship between heat and drought. ""That is an intriguing and fairly dangerous kind of event that obviously has affects on humans,"" he said, referring to drought. The average temperature for the U.S. mainland in June was 71.2 degrees -- 2 degrees above the 20th-century average. It was the 14th warmest June on record. Besides the Midwest and Rocky Mountain region, coastal states have also felt the heat of late: New Jersey, for instance, has experienced 16 straight months (not including data from June) in which average monthly temperatures measured above normal. Stepping back further in time, 2010 tied with 2005 as the warmest ever, based on global surface temperatures, according to NOAA. In fact, a March report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted that ""climate change has led to changes in climate extremes such as heat waves, record high temperatures and, in many regions, heavy precipitation in the past half-century."" Triple-digit strategies for staying healthy . Millions in the central and eastern United States who experienced the latest heat wave got somewhat of a reprieve Monday. But the break in the heat also brought severe storms to some areas. The cold front, while welcome, prompted a series of thunderstorm warnings late Monday afternoon and into the evening from Virginia south to Georgia. The National Weather Service warned of potentially ""quarter-size hail and damaging winds in excess of 60 mph."" There were few indications, by 9:30 p.m., that these storms packed anywhere near the wallop of those from late June. But they did affect some trees and bring torrential rain in spots. Flash floods left as much as five inches of rain in downtown Greensboro, North Carolina, on Monday night, said Darin Figurskey, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Raleigh bureau. ""Motorists are encouraged to stay off the roads, if possible,"" the city said in a press release noting two road closures. Nearby on Interstate 40, between 20 to 30 cars were stranded due to flooding rains, said Figurskey. One upside to the front moving through was much cooler temperatures. High temperatures Monday were in the 80s in cities including Chicago, New York, Boston and Washington, where temperatures on Sunday hit 102 degrees and surpassed 95 for the 11th straight day. Even the 91 degrees recorded Monday in St. Louis was a welcome relief. This cool-down follows a heat wave that roasted much of the country for more than a week and contributed to dozens of heat-related deaths, including 18 in Maryland and 10 in Virginia, according to state officials. Millions also lost power at one point or another, many of them for several days, because of severe storms that swept east from Indiana to the Mid-Atlantic states starting on June 29. As of Monday afternoon, just under 100,000 customers in 11 states and metropolitan Washington still lacked electricity. West Virginians brace for storms, aftermath . On Sunday damaging winds struck Fredericksburg, Virginia, and collapsed a building, injuring two people, according to the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center. The storms have complicated power restoration efforts in some spots and caused even more damage. One person died Saturday in storms in Cuba, Missouri, the prediction center said. ""It has been a tough few weeks for many Virginians,"" Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell said late Sunday. ""They have suffered from record-breaking temperatures and an historic storm that brought widespread damage and power outages. Now, many have lost power again. I ask Virginians to remain patient and to continue to help each other get through this latest storm."" Still, even as the Midwest, Southeast and Northeast cool a bit, the U.S. Southwest is practically boiling.

"(CNN) -- The Bank of England knowingly helped to sell looted Nazi gold from occupied Czechoslovakia months before the outbreak of World War II, according to experts. On Tuesday the Bank of England's archives -- published digitally for the first time -- reveal that ¬£5.6 million of gold was transferred just days after the Nazi siege of Czechslovakia in 1939, which was one of the catalysts that sparked the war. While the transfers themselves were known at the time, the archives unmask private letters and telephone conversations where the Bank of England avoided questions over its Czech gold holdings from the Treasury. The bank sanctioned the transfer of gold -- worth an estimated ¬£736.4 million ($1.1 billion) today, according to the Financial Times -- between two accounts held by the National Bank of Czechoslovakia and the German central bank, known then as the Reichsbank. Albrecht Ritschl, professor of economic history at the London School of Economics, told CNN that the Bank of England ""in cold blood, and pretending not to know what these accounts were and where the gold was coming from, agreed to the transfer."" Ritschl said: ""From the Czech point of view this was very clearly a breach of trust."" The Bank of England declined to comment when contacted by CNN. The archived document claims bank officials suspected but were ""not sure"" the accounts were Czech and German. However, they believed it was ""no business of theirs,"" as both accounts were held by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) -- a central bankers' bank. But David Blaazer, a historian at the University of New South Wales and author of a study on the Bank of England and Czech gold, told CNN: ""There is absolutely no doubt that the Bank knew which numbered BIS account belonged to which central bank."" Despite an attempt by the British government to block all Czech assets in the UK, the transfer went ahead and the story caused an outpouring of public anger. Banker for Germany . With the UK heavily exposed to the German debt crisis in 1931, such transfers were part of an ""economic appeasement"" plan of Nazi Germany by Britain, according to Ritschl. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was keen to avoid conflict with Adolf Hitler's Germany after the human cost and economic devastation caused by the First World War. This culminated in Britain, France, Germany and Italy signing the 'Munich Pact,' leading to the annexation of Czechoslovakia and the country's eventual invasion. Ritschl said: ""This policy started in 1933 when Hjalmar Schacht was reinstalled by Hitler as president of the Reichsbank. ""This was beneficial in the short term for Britain, as Nazi Germany unblocked British assets frozen in Germany,"" Ritschl told CNN. ""Britain then resumed its traditional role as a banker and insurer for Germany's foreign trade. As the episode shows, the Nazis had a reliable partner,"" he said. After the gold transfer, the assets were ""disposed"" of with around ¬£4 million going to the central banks of Belgium and Holland and the remainder sold in London, according to the official report. Ritschl said the personal friendship between Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht and then-Bank of England Governor Montagu Norman may have had a bearing on the bank's actions at the time. Government intervention . In May 1939, then British Chancellor of the Exchequer John Simon wrote to Norman to ask whether the bank was still holding Czech gold. In his reply, Norman did not answer the question but pointed out ""that the bank held gold from time to time for the BIS and had no knowledge of whether it was their own property or that of their customers."" According to Blaazer, the Bank of England could not refuse to follow the order of a customer (the BIS) to transfer gold between its own accounts. He said: ""The bank claimed, and the government accepted, that this particular transaction fell beyond the governments and the banks power.""","Bank of England archives reveal ¬£5.6 million of gold was transferred days after Nazi siege of Czechslovakia in 1939 .

"(CNN) -- Ted Ligety clinched top spot in the World Cup giant slalom (GS) standings for 2013 with a win at Kranjska Gora, Slovenia on Saturday. The American came in first in a combined time of 2 minutes 35.43 seconds, 0.45 seconds ahead of Austria's Marcel Hirscher with Alexis Pinturault of France finishing third. Ligety's fifth GS victory at the Slovenian resort sees him clinch a fourth crystal globe in the discipline adding to titles won in 2008, 2010 and 2011. ""This hill is awesome it has a little of everything to offer so to win here again is incredible and I'm really proud of it,"" Ligety said, fisalpine.com reported. ""Securing the GS title one race in advance is a big weight off my back. I had an awesome season in giant slalom but Hirscher was constantly with me the whole season. Even when I beat him by two seconds he was still there in second and it makes it tougher going for the title. It was a head game when he was so close all along,"" Ligety added. Ligety now has 620 points to Hirscher's 495 with only one race to go at Lenzerheide, Switzerland next weekend. The win caps a remarkable season for the 28-year-old from Salt Lake City which saw him claim three gold medals (GS, super G and super combined) at the World Championships in Schladming, Austria in February. The women's GS event in Ofterschwang, Germany was won by Austria's Anna Fenninger with overall World Cup winner Tina Maze of Slovenia finishing second. Germany's Viktoria Rebensburg was third. Fenninger's second successive World Cup win was secured in a time of two minutes 29.30 seconds, with Maze 0.44 seconds behind. ""I was quite surprised to see how fast I managed to ski in the second run, starting last"", Fenninger said, fisalpine reported. ""The conditions weren't as good as they were obviously in the first run. I've been feeling really good in the last weeks. I skied with instinct and without too much thinking and it's working again today. I'm extremely happy about it,"" the 23-year-old added. Maze, who surpassed Austrian Hermann Maier's 13-year-old record for overall World Cup points last weekend, extended her tally to 2,154 points. The 29-year-old has also comfortably won the GS World Cup title having amassed 700 points to Fenninger's 435 with one race to go.","America's Ted Ligety secures World Cup giant slalom title with win in Slovenia .

"(CNN) -- Surveys indicate that most Americans didn't think shutting down the government in an attempt to dismantle the new health care law was a good idea. They apparently feel the same way about blocking an increase in the nation's debt ceiling to stop Obamacare, according to a new national poll released on Wednesday. A CNN/ORC International survey also indicates that a majority of the public would point fingers at Republicans in Congress if the nation's ability to borrow more money is not increased. With the federal government shut down due to a bitter partisan standoff over spending and the Affordable Care Act, an even more chilling deadline is approaching. The government faces a debt ceiling crunch around October 17, when it expects to run out of options to keep below the legal cap on federal borrowing. Congressional Republicans have signaled they want to use this issue to again go after Obamacare, which would set up a new fight with Senate Democrats and Obama, who says he won't negotiate. According to the poll, 56% of Americans said it would be a bad thing if the debt ceiling was not raised, with 38% saying it would be a good thing for the country. By a 51% to 43% margin, the public said it is more important to raise the debt ceiling than to delay Obamacare. A larger majority, 64% to 27%, in a Quinnipiac University survey released Tuesday said they opposed blocking an increase in the debt ceiling as a way to dismantle the health care law. If the debt ceiling is not raised, just over half of those questioned in the CNN poll, 53%, said congressional Republicans would be more responsible rather than Obama, with 31% pointing more fingers at the president. Those numbers are little changed from July 2011, the last time Obama and Congress fought over the debt ceiling, which was eventually raised. As with the battle over the government shutdown, the poll indicated that Democrats and Republicans don't see eye to eye over raising the debt ceiling. ""Most Republicans think that it would be a good thing for the country if the debt ceiling is not raised, but only 18% of Democrats agree,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Among most other major demographics groups, failure to raise the debt ceiling is seen as a bad thing."" ""You have bipartisan consensus among economists that not raising the debt ceiling would be a disaster, but politically you have a divide. Yes, more people say raise the debt ceiling and fight the health care debate somewhere else, but you have Republican lawmakers going home, most of them to safe Republican districts. And they're being told by many of their constituents not to worry about it ,' you don't have to raise the debt ceiling',"" CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said. The survey also indicates independents are split. ""Here's a sales problem for the president. Even among independents, a pretty even divide on whether raising the debt ceiling is a good or bad thing,"" King added. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International September 27-29, with 803 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. What do you think? Here's your chance to weigh in below. Which do you think is more important for Congress to do? Raising the debt ceiling to make sure the government has enough money to pay its debts . Delaying the date on which major provisions in the new health care law will take effect . Or are both equally important?","Americans don't think tying Obamacare to debt ceiling hike a good idea, CNN/ORC poll .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Prosecutors in eastern China have charged six Communist Party investigators who allegedly drowned a local official during interrogation with intentional assault, the victim's family told CNN. The news reignites debate over the existence of a secretive extrajudicial process faced by accused Communist Party members. Yu Qiyi, 41, who was the chief engineer of state-owned Wenzhou Industrial Investment Group in Zhejiang province, died in a local hospital on April 9. The night before, the six investigators made Yu strip and sit in a bathtub filled with icy water, and then repeatedly held his head under water despite his struggling and cries for help, according to the indictment paper, a copy of which was provided to CNN by the Yu family. The Wenzhou branch of the ruling Communist Party's Discipline Inspection Commission had detained Yu for more than a month to question his role in a land deal. Prosecutors in nearby Quzhou, who were assigned the case, said that evidence has clearly shown that, frustrated by his perceived lack of cooperation, the investigators tortured Yu in an attempt to extract a confession. Yu's body was covered with bruises in photos taken in the hospital by a family lawyer. The official autopsy sent to the family said Yu died of ""lung malfunction caused by inhaled fluids, caused by others."" ""He looked so painfully thin that he became almost unrecognizable,"" Yu's wife Wu Qian told CNN, adding that she was disappointed by the authorities' handling of the aftermath despite the indictment. ""They came only once after his death and told me they would deal with the case in a civilized way,"" she said. ""During the autopsy and investigation, I was not informed at all."" As Chinese President Xi Jinping vows to eradicate rampant corruption, Yu's case has become the latest example of the controversial ""shuanggui"" process, which often involves lengthy detention and what critics call brutal treatment of accused officials, especially those who refuse to admit wrongdoings. ""Shuanggui"" literally means ""dual designation"" in Chinese, which is short for a probe conducted in a designated time and designated location. Since it is based on the Communist Party's own regulations instead of formal laws and procedures, shuanggui is even less transparent than the party-controlled judicial system. Recent state media reports have highlighted torture allegations in several shuanggui cases, including the sudden deaths of a court official in Henan province in April and a seismological agency director in Hubei province in June. Both families have described the officials' bruised bodies as signs of torture and demanded thorough investigations. During his high-profile trial last month, disgraced Communist Party leader Bo Xilai mentioned making false confessions under pressure while in shuanggui confinement. ""The investigators took care of me and spoke to me politely,"" Bo said in his closing remarks, according to a court-released transcript. ""But I was under pressure during the process."" Some of Bo's courtroom comments expunged from the official account, however, include his detailing of threats made against him and his family by investigators, two individuals with detailed knowledge of the trial told CNN. During his pre-trial incarceration, according to those sources, Bo said investigators warned him of the possibility of his wife's execution and his son's arrest, and told him about the cases of other prominent officials -- one of whom confessed and was spared, and another who did not cooperate and was executed. Although many legal experts view the prosecution of Yu's alleged torturers as a small step forward, they say the key is to address the root cause of his death. ""The six investigators arrested were mere scapegoats,"" said Pu Zhiqiang, one of the lawyers representing the Yu family, blaming the legal team's difficulty to access the case files on political sensitivity of the shuanggui issue. ""Shuanggui is an illegal process -- abuse and torture during interrogation have become standard operating procedure."" Pu calls for the abolition of shuanggui, comparing it to the notorious ""laojiao"" -- or ""re-education through labor"" -- another extrajudicial system in China that allows police to jail offenders in labor camps for up to four years without trial. The horrific details of Yu's case seem to have jolted ordinary Chinese citizens into reassessing a procedure that has long been hailed as an effective weapon against corrupt party officials. Many had just applauded the party leadership's recent decision to launch corruption investigations against several senior officials tied to the state oil industry, including a member of the elite Central Committee whose sacking was announced earlier this week. As Internet users condemn Yu's torture on social media, a number of state-run news outlets have also voiced their concern over an unchecked process. ""Power without powerful supervision makes everyone a potential victim -- whether you are a subject of the shuanggui rules like Yu Qiyi or an imprisoned former enforcer of those rules,"" read a commentary published in the Yunnan Information Daily on Thursday, with an apparent reference to Bo Xilai, who once governed the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing with an iron fist. ""Cracking down on corruption and punishing the corrupt are the common aspiration of the people,"" it added. ""But no matter how just the end is, it has to be achieved through just means."" By Thursday night, the article had disappeared from the newspaper's website. CNN's Feng Ke contributed to this report.","Yu Qiyi, 41, who was being investigated for his part in a land deal, died on April 9 .

"(CNN) -- Jebb Graff isn't turned off -- yet -- by Carnival Cruise Lines' recent troubles. Graff took a seven-day cruise last fall on the Carnival Fantasy to Grand Turk, Half Moon Cay and Nassau, Bahamas and had a wonderful time. ""It was a fantastic trip,"" wrote Graff, a photographer in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina, in an email. ""A few veteran cruisers grumbled about the age of the ship, and the decor being dated, but the service and experience was really great,"" he said. Graff said he would definitely take another Carnival cruise. But he has some conditions. ""There's no question that Carnival should be seriously looking into their maintenance policies and double-checking their work to make sure their customers and crews are having the safest voyages possible,"" wrote Graff. ""If these issues continue to go on unchecked, then I'll change my answer."" Carnival cruise line in more troubled waters . Carnival has a window of opportunity to convince customers its ships can sail without too much trouble, according to several travel agents and cruisers interviewed by CNN.com. But the company has to prove it is tackling the recent spate of mechanical issues faced by four Carnival ships, the most serious of which left more than 4,000 people stranded for days aboard the Carnival Triumph last month. 'A grace period' to fix things . Carnival has a grace period of a couple months to get its act together, according to travel agent Ricci Zukerman. Her mostly high-end clients occasionally book a more budget-oriented Carnival cruise for a family reunion or when they're bringing teenagers along because ""they're the fun ships,"" she said. ""Carnival has been in business for many years, and for a long time there's never been a hitch,"" said Zukerman, president of Worldview Travel. But they need to attend to their maintenance issues. ""If it happens again, I think people will start worrying. There are other ships in the ocean,"" although none quite so affordable, she said. Carnival Cruise Lines announced a ""comprehensive review"" this week of all its ships, prompted by the engine fire that led to the Triumph's stranding in the Gulf of Mexico in February. As the biggest cruise company in the world, parent company Carnival Corp. has a strong reputation in the industry and among its regular customers, said Kimberly Wilson Wetty, co-president of Valerie Wilson Travel. In addition to Carnival Cruise Lines, the corporation's portfolio includes brands such as Holland America Line, Princess Cruises, Seabourn, Cunard and Costa Cruises. The Costa Concordia had a deadly accident off the coast of Italy last year. Five things we've learned about cruising . Overall advance bookings are down . Total advance bookings across all of Carnival Corp.'s brands for 2013 are behind 2012 levels, Carnival said in a news release Friday announcing first quarter financial results. But despite the overall lag, booking volume since January for the rest of the year has been ""running significantly higher than last year at slightly higher prices,"" the company said. ""Despite considerable attention surrounding the Carnival Triumph, we had been encouraged to see booking volumes for Carnival Cruise Lines recover significantly in recent weeks,"" said Micky Arison, chief executive officer of Carnival Corp. ""All ships experience some challenges,"" said Wetty, who traditionally books her customers on high-end cruises. ""It's all the recovery and how they treat the passengers and how they continue to build consumer confidence. ""For those who are consistent cruisers and know Carnival, I don't think it's going to change their buying habits. For new cruisers, it puts a little doubt in their minds. "" Not every frequent Carnival cruiser is feeling so confident. ""I have cruised with Carnival on many occasions with my family. They were my [favorite] cruise line. That being said, I will stay on land from here on out,"" wrote one CNN.com commenter. ""Until they have a really really long period of time with no problems I will not consider cruising with them again. This is just way too much. The Concordia going down was bad enough, but all of these are just plain nonsense. It WILL hurt the cruise line."" Customers need to be reassured Carnival is doing everything it can to address its ships' issues, Wetty said. How Carnival can clean up the PR mess . Customers of canceled cruises complain . Current customers, some of whom have been posting on CNN.com, are having trouble reaching the company in some cases. ""What about those of us that got our cruise canceled?"" wrote one commenter, who said she was scheduled to sail on the Carnival Dream. ""I haven't heard anything from Carnival, and I don't know how long it will take to get a refund. Now we are stuck not knowing what to do for a vacation we saved 8 years to take!"" Still, Connie Hammond is one of those Carnival fans who isn't giving up on the cruise line. ""All three of my prior Carnival cruises were wonderful, food was outstanding, ports were well organized and safe, shipboard activities were plentiful, all for a small budget price,"" Hammond, a resident of Fort Madison, Iowa, wrote in an e-mail. ""I'm sure I could have paid $1,000 more per person and been impressed much more, but the Carnival cruise was a great vacation and a memorable fun time."" Hammond said she expects the recent incidents will be a wake-up call for Carnival's maintenance program, but she's not concerned about safety. She's already booked her next Carnival cruise, taking her 79-year-old mother and a girlfriend who has never been on a cruise.

"(CNN) -- Between your new regimen of daily workouts, volunteering, painting or whatever else you've resolved to do more of in the New Year, make time for a few tech-centric resolutions. They're low impact and will keep your memories and online identity safer, your mind sharper and your friendships healthier. Here are six you can do right now. You'll thank yourself later. Back up your stuff . Back up your files. Do it now, do it often, do not put it off until your hard drive suddenly and unexpectedly perishes or until your laptop is stolen from a cafe when you run to the bathroom. Everyone will have different backup needs, but for the most basic computer backups there are a few basic options. You can use an external hard drive or a cloud service. There are services like Carbonite, which will automatically back up photos, music, documents and emails for an annual fee. If you have an Apple computer, turn on Time Machine and it will backup your files to the drive of your choice in the background. You also can use a cloud storage service like Dropbox or Google Drive to save a copy of select files. A nice Dropbox feature is that it can automatically save new photos from connected cameras or smartphones to the cloud. Turn on 2-factor authentication . Hopefully by now you know and follow all the best practices for protecting your passwords: Avoid dictionary words; use multiword pass phrases; don't use the same password across multiple sites; keep it memorable but not obvious. But strong passwords aren't enough to keep you completely secure. When it comes to your important online accounts, one of the most effective security measures you can take is turning on two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication requires you to confirm your identity with two separate things. Typically it's something you know, like a password, and something you have, like your cell phone or a key fob. For example, when you try to log in to a Gmail account from an unrecognized location, Google will text you a code you need to enter. Start with your e-mail accounts, which can be used to gain access to your other online accounts. Gmail and Yahoo both offer two-factor authentication, but Outlook currently does not. Cloud storage services with two-factor include Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft's Sky Drive. Apple's iCloud does not yet offer it. Facebook has its own two-factor feature called login approvals. Two-factor can be a hassle to use and will take some getting used to, but it's a small inconvenience to avoid the much larger, more devastating inconvenience of being hacked. Scan old photos . We all have them. The stacks of old photos hidden in boxes under the bed or collecting dust in basements. If you don't have digital copies of these gems, stop stalling and start scanning. Natural disasters, floods and fires can wipe out film memories in an instant. To scan your images, get a flatbed scanner and place multiple images on the bed at a time. You can crop and retouch individual pictures later. If manually scanning in each old photo sounds like too big (or boring) of an undertaking, you can hire a company to do it for you. Many local camera stores offer bulk-scanning services and will return your originals along with high-resolution TIFFs or JPEGs on a CD or hard drive. And you can store copies of your photos online in case your laptop crashes (see resolution No. 1). If you're comfortable sending your photos away, the best option is using a company that specialize in bulk photo scanning. They'll even do light retouching and repairs for older pictures, videos and slides. Check out ScanDigital.com or ScanCafe.com. Step away from the smartphone . If you spend most of the day with your nose buried a smartphone, tablet or computer, make an effort to break out of the digital world and interact more with the humans around you in 2013. Don't habitually check your online social networks while hanging out with your flesh-and-blood friends. On a date? Don't even think about texting. (Unless the date is going horribly and they're in the bathroom and you need to arrange an emergency extraction.) Attempt to live in the moment instead of just documenting the moment on Instagram. Yes, that sunset will look stunning with the Valencia filter, but it will look even better through your own eyeballs. There's a time and a place for texting and e-mailing and checking Twitter. But this year, let's try to leave the screens in our pockets and bags more often and engage with the world around us. Read the TOS and check privacy settings . Terms of service are long, boring documents filled with impenetrable legalese. But before you upload content or share personal information with a site, take a few minutes to read over its terms of service -- and any privacy agreements -- so you have a better idea of who owns your data and what the company can do with it. Start with the biggies you're probably already using such as Google, Facebook, Instagram, Yahoo and Twitter. Next, take a trip to your privacy settings. Even if you had your settings just the way you wanted them a year ago, the company could have updated the controls and left some of your information exposed. Learn something new online . Tech resolutions aren't all preventative measures to avoid doom and gloom. You can also embark on fun, self-improvement projects. Quality classes are free and plentiful online. There are courses for every age, interest and attention span, from major universities and organizations. Pick up a language, learn how to code at Codecademy or just be inspired by the best Ted Talks.

"(CNN) -- Two years ago Lindsey Vonn suffered heartbreak when the weather gods robbed her of skiing's prestigious World Cup overall title. Fast-forward to 2013 and it is Vonn's turn to thank the elements as the American has been handed the World Cup downhill crown for a record sixth year in a row -- despite being sidelined with a serious knee injury. She held off Slovenia's Tina Maze by just a single point after bad fog forced the abandonment of the season's final downhill race in Lenzerheide in Switzerland on Wednesday. Vonn wrote on her Facebook page: ""Omg I won the World Cup Downhill title!!!!! 6 in a row with a bum knee! Everything in life comes back around. #believe #karma #onelegvictorydance #sochi2014."" The Sochi hashtag is a reference to next February's Winter Olympics in Russia, where the 28-year-old hopes to defend her downhill gold from Vancouver 2010. She has now won 17 Crystal Globes -- handed out for the overall title and each of the six disciplines competed for each season. It puts her two short of male skiing legend Ingemar Stenmark, who holds the record of 19. Vonn was airlifted to hospital on the opening day of February's world championships at Schladming, Austria, where she suffered a torn ACL and MCL in her right knee and a lateral tibial plateau fracture after crashing in the super G race. After losing out to Maria Hofl-Riesch by just three points in agonizing circumstances following the cancellation of her race in 2011, Vonn was understandably thrilled with her latest success. It had looked unlikely with overall World Cup champion Maze expected to overturn the one-point deficit, but fog at the bottom section of the racecourse forced a cancellation. Going into the final event, Vonn led the standings with 340 points despite missing the preceding races at Meribel and Garmisch, with Maze right behind her. Hofl-Riesch ended up third and Vonn's U.S. teammate Stacy Cook was fourth. Maze took to Twitter to congratulate Vonn, writing: ""I guess the DH globe belongs to someone else, Congratulation Lindsey! What goes around comes around!"" Vonn overtook Annemarie Moser-Proll, who won five consecutive downhill titles between 1971-75 on her way to seven globes in the discipline. Vonn also eclipsed the Austrian's 16 globes. In the men's World Cup, Aksel Lund Svindal was declared downhill champion after Wednesday's event was called off. The Norwegian, who has now won nine globes during his career, boasted a 58-point advantage over defending champion Klaus Kroll of Austria going into Finals week. Svindal's victory makes him just the seventh man in the sport's history to win the downhill and super-G titles in the same season.","Lindsey Vonn wins sixth successive downhill title after final race canceled .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A woman identified as a Saudi Arabian princess has been accused of holding a domestic servant against her will at her condominium in Irvine, California. Meshael Alayban, 42, faces one felony count of human trafficking. Court details released Thursday say Alayban is one of the wives of Saudi Prince Abdulrahman bin Nasser bin Abdulaziz al Saud. Alayban appeared in an Orange County court in Santa Ana on Thursday, and the judge continued the arraignment until July 29. In the courtroom, Alayban was kept inside a cage-like holding space and spoke with her attorney through the wire webbing. Alayban is being held in the Orange County jail in lieu of $5 million bail. She faces a maximum sentence of 12 years if convicted. Official: Human trafficking probe at Saudi diplomat's home . Police say the servant is a 30-year-old woman, originally from Kenya, who managed to escape Tuesday and flag down a bus. A passenger helped her contact the Irvine Police Department. Investigators say the alleged victim had contracted to work with Alayban's family in Saudi Arabia in March 2012. Her salary was set at $1,600 a month for working eight hours a day, five days a week. But once she arrived in Saudi Arabia, the servant says, her passport was taken from her. She also says she was paid only $220 a month and forced to work 16 hours a day, seven days a week. Alayban's attorney, Paul S. Meyer, indicated in a statement, however, that the incident is essentially a labor dispute. Meyer told the court during the bail hearing that ""the police report confirms that there was no physical abuse, no physical restraint, and that the complaints were about hours worked and wages paid,"" according to his statement. ""We intend to fully investigate all facts, and expect that the truth will resolve this matter,"" Meyer's statement said. Police say Alayban's family traveled to the United States in May with the alleged victim and four women from the Philippines under similar contracts. Armed with a search warrant, Irvine detectives and immigration and homeland security agents later found the four other women in the condominium, a news release from police and the Orange County District Attorney's Office says. Police say all five women are in good health, and at this time, there are no indications of physical abuse. This is the first forced labor human trafficking case to be prosecuted in Orange County under California's Proposition 35, which passed in November and increased the penalty for human trafficking.

A revival of the Los Angeles Dodgers following the arrival of Yasiel Puig, a young Cuban kid with incredible charisma. Oh, and let's not forget the low-budget, low-expectation Pittsburgh Pirates looking like bling-ring contenders for a change. And the large-budget, lousy-last-year Boston Red Sox looking a whole better than a lot of experts expected them to look. And a lot of other fun in the sun. Only to get rained on again. Major League Baseball stepped up that day to suspend a big, big name of the game, Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers, his league's Most Valuable Player of 2011, for the remainder of 2013. Ryan Braun suspended . In a vaguely worded statement, the 29-year-old Braun alluded to having ""made some mistakes"" as he accepted a ban from the field for the rest of this season. Braun had dodged this bullet once before, having failed a 2011 drug test only to successfully appeal it. Now he conceded, saying, ""I am not perfect."" Guess not. It is not a perfect game, baseball, but it sure can be a thing of beauty when it is played the right way. To our continuing disillusionment, we keep adding names to a Dead Sea-like scroll of players who go at it the wrong way (or sure do seem to). Some of us simply roll our eyes, the way we do when politicians get caught doing something unattractive, take themselves out of the game for a while, then magically reappear to run again on the I Am Not Perfect ticket and seek your vote. You can expect Braun to be back, much the same way. A fan or two will boo in 2014 when his name is announced at a game, but if he hits the ball over the wall, a thousand or two others will stand and give him a hand as he rounds the bases, saying ""nice job, Brauny,"" thrilled to have him back. Milwaukee itself won't mind this latest suspension as much as it would if its team were not currently in last place. Trust me, if the Brewers were neck-and-neck right now with the St. Louis Cardinals and the Pirates in their division's race for first place, beers would be cried into from Madison to Beloit to Sheboygan. This guy is a huge deal there. ""Braun"" jerseys aren't often seen on Broadway or in the Bay Area or deep in the heart of Texas, but in Wisconsin, he seemed to be the Hank Aaron of his generation, a rising star in his 20s who could well be a legend by his 40s. In six seasons, Braun has been voted Rookie of the Year in one, then an All-Star in the next five. He already has 211 home runs. Robin Yount, who spent his entire 20-year career in Milwaukee before being elected to baseball's Hall of Fame, hit a total of 251 homers in that span. That'll give you a small idea of how big Braun could be. He is paid a king's ransom, if Kate's and Will's new baby in England won't mind us saying. Braun has a nine-figure contract in Milwaukee that runs through the year 2020. He is expected back at Miller Park, same time next year, tail between legs but bat in hand. Kwik Trip drops Braun after drug suspension . I doubt if many elsewhere would recognize Ryan Braun today if he came walking down the street toward you. He probably wouldn't be mobbed by paparazzi in, say, New York, a city with a history of big baseball stars. Or mobbed by autograph hounds in downtown Chicago, which is just 90 miles from Milwaukee, which is where Braun absolutely IS a big baseball star. He wouldn't have many smartphone cameras aimed his way while having dinner in Los Angeles, which is in the general vicinity of Braun's hometown. He is no Derek Jeter, a famous face coast-to-coast. Nor is he Alex Rodriguez, but they definitely do have something in common. A-Rod's name has been linked to Biogenesis, a so-called ""anti-aging"" clinic in South Florida that is being investigated over the possibility of making performance-enhancing drugs available to a number of athletes. Braun's name also surfaced in that investigation. Some believe his suspension Monday will be just the first of several more to follow in the days ahead. Again and again, the game of baseball has taken measures and given assurance that steroid use or substance abuse in any form will not be tolerated. We tend to nod and believe none of today's players would be foolish enough to take such a risk, but the fools could very well be us. CNN Explains: Performance enhancing drugs . It was only a year ago that the All-Star Game was won by the National League -- and, as a reward, home-field advantage for the World Series -- with no small thanks due to Melky Cabrera, a player from the San Francisco Giants who was voted the midsummer game's MVP. But shortly thereafter, Cabrera was suspended for a positive drug test and did not return to the Giants, who happily enjoyed their home-field edge in the World Series anyway. Thank goodness this year's All-Star Game hero was the Yankees' heroic figure Rivera, a man whose career has been pure to the point of immaculate in its lack of controversy or reputation stain. I am certain that Mariano must have been guilty of doing something wrong during his career -- a parking ticket, perhaps, or leaving a sock in his locker -- but he remains among the hundreds of major leaguers who give us hope that baseball is a game more clean than dirty. Ryan Braun pulled the old Lance Armstrong routine, casting aspersions on the work of those who did the testing and investigating, making it sound like somebody was out to get him. A lot of people bought it. He was going to be the one who really did get unfairly tagged as a doper (and a dope). Sure he was. And then rainy days and Mondays come around, and there was Braun's permanent stain for all to see. It gets tiresome, doesn't it? Hearing about this stuff? Reading about it? (Writing about it sure as hell does.) Wouldn't it be sweet if we could just get through an entire season talking about nothing else except whether the Oriole boy would wallop 75 home runs, or if the Pirates would finally get to hold a World Series in their beautiful ballpark, or if L.A.'s fans would introduce a ""Puig Leagues"" section in the outfield seats as prominently as the ""Hollywood"" sign? Oh, and don't the Braves look good, too? And, hey, the Rays are really on a roll. And that's a nice trade the Rangers just made. And, whoa, that Reds kid sure does throw hard. And maybe the A's really are in it to win it. And the town might be bankrupt but Detroit's team is loaded, man. And plenty of good seats in Miami still available. Dopes, go away. We're trying to watch a game here. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Downey.","Ryan Braun suspended for the rest of the year by Major League Baseball .

"Mobile, Alabama (CNN) -- Brianna Adkins stepped off the Carnival Triumph early Friday and into the arms of her anxious parents, bringing to an end the nightmarish journey aboard a crippled ship that was towed to port days after it was due. It was a big, tight hug between 18-year-old Adkins and her mom and dad, the kind filled with the emotion that reflected the days of uncertainty after the cruise ship was left virtually dead in the water after a reported engine fire knocked out power. ""Just to be with them, just to let them know I'm safe,"" Adkins said, fighting back tears. ""It means just so much to be with them ... you have no idea."" My celebration trup on the Carnival Triumph: From joy to misery . A near party-atmosphere abounded aboard the cruise ship as it docked late Thursday at the Alabama Cruise Terminal, where some passengers hung over balcony rails, while others danced and waved signs. ""I kissed the ground when I got off,"" said Adkins of Noblesville, Indiana, just north of Indianapolis. The saga began unfolding early Sunday morning as the Carnival Triumph, originally carrying 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew members, was making its way to Galveston, Texas, when a fire left the vessel listing to the side and drifting in the Gulf of Mexico. The ship drifted nearly 90 miles before enough tugboats arrived to tow the massive cruise ship to Mobile. Almost immediately, reports emerged on social media of deteriorating conditions aboard the ship. Passengers reported sewage sloshing in the hallways and, in some cases, running down the walls of cabins. Still others said the power outage forced people, especially those in the lower decks or inside cabins, to drag their mattresses to outside decks because of stifling heat. The power outage also made it impossible for passengers to call loved ones. Why did it take five days? For those who were able to get messages out -- drafting on wireless from cruise ships dropping supplies -- it was a few moments to reassure loved ones they were OK. Still, for Adkins and others there was nothing better than being able to put both feet on firm ground while wrapping their arms around family members. ""The unknown was the worst part,"" Adkins mother, Beth, said. About 75 families were on hand, according to a spokesman for the City of Mobile, at the Alabama Cruise Terminal. Family members who spoke to CNN said they had come from Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana and Texas. Some had come in as early as Wednesday but the bulk of people arrived Thursday afternoon, with each hour bringing a few more cars. After a bad cruise, can you cruise into court? Most of the anxious families couldn't bear the thought of their relatives being on a bus for hours and had gotten hotel rooms in Mobile where the homecoming would include a long shower and a meal. Brooklyn Burgess, 18, got off the ship scanning the crowd for father and brother, who had driven from their Carthage, Mississippi, home to get them and bring them home. There in the crowd, she and her mother, who was traveling with her, found the family. Her father picked her up in a tight hug, and Burgess started to cry. ""I said I don't have a boyfriend. ... I sure hope somebody who missed me is there waiting for me,"" she said, her eyes red from tears. Video: Passengers spell out help . For others, it will be a little longer before they connect with loved ones. Brittany Ferguson and Kendall Jenkins, both 24, got off the ship cheering and dancing. Jenkins went so far as to lay kneel down and kiss the ground. ""We won this cruise at a Houston Rockets game. Lucky us,"" Ferguson said, laughing. They are among the many who boarded one of the more than 100 motor coaches that were reserved by Carnival to take them to New Orleans where many will overnight before continuing their journey home. The two are headed home to Houston. But that's OK with the Ferguson and Jenkins because they have ""land under our feet."" Spate of fires hits cruise industry .

"(CNN) -- Facebook has been on a cloning tear recently. On Thursday, the social media company announced that its photo app Instagram was adding support for 15-second videos, a la Twitter's hit Vine app. There are a few minor differences: Vine is only 6 seconds; Instagram has filters; Vine loops; Instagram lets you delete a clip. But they are essentially the same tool. This is not the first time Facebook has tried replicating another company's features. It imitated Foursquare with its Places check-ins, Instagram with the Camera app, Twitter with profiles you can follow and Snapchat with the Poke app. Last week, Facebook finally added hashtags, another creation started on Twitter, though the outrage seems to be more that it took so long. While perhaps disappointing, it is unsurprising that a minor feature gets so much media coverage (Yes. This is my third article on the topic). Facebook has more than a billion users around the world. Instagram says 130 million people use the photo-sharing service every month, and most will be excited to get a cool new feature like video. In just 24 hours, 5 million videos were uploaded to the service, according to Instagram. What happens on these tools, even when they are tiny, has an immediate impact on a huge amount of people. ""Facebook is a very important company in the world,"" said Brian Singerman, a partner at the Founders Fund investment firm. ""Anything Facebook does impacts a billion people. That in and of itself, becoming a communications platform for a billion people, is a pretty impressive feat in the world."" The small features can also have big impacts on the company itself. Originality is risky, and Facebook is now a public company tasked with making investors money after a particularly harrowing first year on the stock market. For Facebook, advertising, particularly on mobile devices, is where that money will come from. In 2012, 84% of Facebook's revenue came from advertising, and videos are going to play a bigger role in future online advertising revenue. There are no paid ads on Instagram yet, but it is very brand-savvy. A handful of major companies seem to have been given early access to the new feature and posted promotional videos on the service. Major companies to post such videos include Burberry, the Los Angeles Dodgers, Gap and MTV. The practice of an established company copying successful features isn't new or particular surprising. According to Chris Dixon of Silicon Valley investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, this is the same pattern that happened 10 or 12 years ago with Microsoft. Intuit would build a cool product for Windows, and then Microsoft would copy it. Borrowing features from other companies and improving on them is part of being competitive. ""It's always a threat, but then you see these things break out,"" Dixon said. Facebook's track record has been hit or miss. SnapChat could be one of those breakouts it didn't manage to squash. The independent mobile messaging app has grown in popularity while Facebook's Poke app hasn't caught on. Experts say Facebook's recent spate of arguably ho-hum announcements isn't an accurate representation of Silicon Valley as a whole. Many early-stage companies, they say, are taking the big risks and working on technology that will change the world. ""Silicon Valley is not just about apps for smartphones and doing a photo-sharing app that has a blue border instead of a red one,"" Singerman said. Founder's Fund's own Peter Thiel was an early investor in Facebook, but the firm is now focused on finding companies with very large barriers to entry that cannot be easily be cloned. Investments include ride-sharing company Lyft, big data company Palantir and space-travel company Space X. It also focuses on companies that are working to solve some of the world's biggest problems, such as health care and energy. ""The issue is, from a (venture capitalist's) perspective, we have moved on,"" said Navin Chaddha of Mayfield Ventures. ""We are working on things that are going to be on the Facebook level in five to 10 years, but mass media is focused on what's already big."" Innovating isn't just for startups. Both Apple and Google have worked on risky products as mature companies, but they are also standing on firmer financial ground. Once it has appeased investors, perhaps Facebook will go back to its ""hacking"" ethos and release something unexpected and new. As for the other companies that are busy working on the next big thing, they aren't putting too much energy into organizing press events with Blue Bottle coffee and amazing baked goods because, for now, their business models don't require it. They are aiming higher. ""The only way to get much, much, much larger is to focus on being really valuable to to the world,"" Singerman said. ""They're not doing it for fame; they're doing it for a mission. ... Sometimes those things just take a little longer.""","Instagram's new video feature is the latest imitation feature from Facebook .
The minor updates are not representative of the innovations happening in Silicon Valley .
Tech companies are working on big problems like health care and energy .

"(CNN) -- There's a great dive bar in my neighborhood called Jack's where they oven-bake the chicken wings. And they're absolutely amazing. I'm not saying I've had semi-inappropriate fantasies about them. But I'm also not denying it. Yes. Things continue to be weird at home. But it's worth noting that, despite my undying love for these wings, I'm actually a complete coward when it comes to sauce. I always get teriyaki. Spicy foods have never really been my thing. Unlike some of my friends who, in a pinch, would happily use Texas Pete for contact lens solution. So, I could only sit in horror as I read a trending story from England this week about the first person to finish the ""world's hottest curry."" And, sadly, we can only assume this brave hero also sat in horror several hours later when he realized that the world's hottest curry wanted out. ""Strong men ... also cry."" Nevertheless, Dr. Ian Rothwell proudly became the first of more than 300 people to conquer Bindi restaurant's famous dish, ""The Widower."" A name that, apparently, had a slightly more menacing ring to it than ""The Care Bear."" Bindi restaurant, in the English East Midlands town of Grantham, has been serving the Widower since 2010. The recipe, which is openly shared online, has become a popular Web search as curry enthusiasts around the world clamor for new and interesting ways to make one of the most delicious and wonderful foods on the planet completely inedible. Specifically, the main driving force behind the Widower's heat is 20 Infinity chilis, which were developed by a Grantham man named Nick Woods who grew the record-breaking strain completely by accident. Bindi restaurant's managing director and executive chef, Muhammed Karim, took those accidental chilis, combined them with other peppers and extracts, and created what he believes is the world's hottest curry. I'll never know because I still value the functioning ability of my esophagus. It's where pudding goes. Amazingly, just cooking the storied dish requires gloves, goggles and a gas mask. Which, generally speaking, is a sure sign that whatever you're doing in the kitchen is less safe than, say, heating up a Lean Pocket. Cooking meth is less safe than heating up a Lean Pocket. I rest my case. And so, hundreds of people have tried to finish off the Widower. But up until just the other day, nobody had ever made it to the end. And only a few have lasted past four or five mouthfuls, most opting instead to vomit, cry and rethink their overall purpose in life. ""I should buy a boat."" Though Rothwell amazingly finished the entire dish in just over an hour, it wasn't easy. In fact, it was probably downright reckless. Armed only with a bottle of beer, he bravely made it halfway through the meal before excusing himself for a short walk. Not so much because it was a particularly nice day but because he actually began hallucinating. About 10 minutes later, his wife found him wandering up Grantham High Street, presumably having a rather nefarious conversation with own hand. ""Agreed. We shall light stuff on fire."" Eventually, with tears running from his eyes, Rothwell downed the very last bite of the world's hottest curry. Or so the restaurant still claims. It's all rather unofficial. However, what is official is the actual hottest chili pepper. According to Guinness World Records, that honor was most recently set in March 2011 by the Trinidad Scorpion ""Butch T"" pepper from Australia. I Googled this thing, and it looks pretty damn mean. If ever there was a fruit capable of having sex with your sister and kicking your dog, it's the Trinidad Scorpion. The previously mentioned Infinity chili -- used in the Widower -- earned the highly coveted record a year earlier in March 2010 but was ousted only a few months later by the Naga Viper chili, also grown in the UK. They remain third and second, respectively. So, that's the story of the man who conquered the world's hottest curry. Surely, everybody knows someone right now who would gladly accept the challenge. And they would all likely fail. For it takes a true warrior to step up and face the Widower. Or you can just be sensible and have something else.

"Washington (CNN) -- Nine Japanese auto parts manufacturers and two executives have agreed to plead guilty and pay more than $740 million in criminal fines as part of an ongoing price fixing investigation, the Justice Department said on Thursday. The companies in the latest case fixed prices in 30 different car parts sold to the big Detroit automakers and admitted fixing prices on products sold to U.S. subsidiaries of the major Japanese car companies. The parts were installed on more than 25 million vehicles purchased in the United States, the Justice Department said. ""As a result of these conspiracies, Americans paid more for their cars,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said. Chrysler, Ford Motor and General Motors, as well as Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru and Toyota -- all of which do business in the United States -- were victimized, the Justice Department said. The overall probe, the largest criminal investigation by the Justice Department's antitrust division, has so far resulted in more than $1.6 billion in fines and criminal convictions of 17 executives. Affected parts have included seat belts, radiators, wipers, air conditioning systems, power window motors, and power steering parts, the Justice Department said.

"(CNN) -- ""A peep show."" That's how attorney James Egan described the jail in Puyallup, Washington. In a lawsuit filed Thursday on behalf of 12 plaintiffs -- 11 women and one man -- Egan alleges that police there recorded suspects undressing and using the toilet. Each had been arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. ""For an extended period, the Puyallup Police Department has engaged in a pattern and practice of violating the fundamental rights to bodily privacy, dignity, and unlawful searches and seizures of the inmates detained within the Puyallup Police Department's Jail,"" read the lawsuit, which was filed in Pierce County Superior Court. ""Plaintiffs had a reasonable expectation of privacy which was violated by their having been secretly videotaped in assorted states of undress. It is believed that officers may have committed this offense for the purpose of obtaining arousal or personal gratification,"" the suit continued. Police and the city deny any wrongdoing. They say suspects are given clothes to change into before having their mug shots taken, and are recorded for the safety of everyone at the jail. ""People are very creative in where they can hide things. They hide things in places you wouldn't image. The jail business is not fun and it's not safe. So we have to expect the worst,"" said Kevin Yamamoto, city attorney for Puyallup. The lawsuit describes in great detail the alleged experiences of the 12 plaintiffs, who are identified by their initials. S.C. was recorded changing clothes in a holding cell. She alleges that officers made inappropriate comments, saying things like, ""I love red heads,"" and ""You have a nice body,"" the lawsuits reads. ""What they were doing is perverted. This is like a porn video they were watching. I feel extremely violated. They took me at my most vulnerable part and forced me to indulge in their needs or sick fantasy to watch me undress and gawk at me afterwards,"" S.C. is quoted as saying. Another plaintiff, identified as M.L., was recorded using the toilet and changing her clothes. ""It was one of the worst experiences of my life because of how mean and rude they treated me. I am absolutely horrified and violated. I honestly can't believe it. I had no idea there were cameras around. The fact those are supposed to be police officers upholding our justice system while violating it is absolutely disgusting,"" she said. Capt. Ryan Portmann, with the Puyallup police, accused Egan of picking the 12 plaintiffs out of many possible cases because they look better on paper. Jail video monitoring is widespread. Many correctional institutions use it, and it's legitimate, Portmann said. ""I'm just as human as anyone else, and I wouldn't like it,"" said Yamamoto, the city attorney. But, he added: ""We have a facility we need to ensure the safety of."" CNN's Cristy Lenz contributed to this report.","The lawsuit was filed on behalf of 12 plaintiffs: 11 women and one man .

"(CNN) -- A deadly explosion on a bus carrying Israeli tourists outside an airport in Bulgaria was ""clearly a terrorist attack,"" Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Wednesday. Key Israeli politicians pointed to Iran as the likely instigator, but Israel's U.S. ambassador acknowledged they had no proof. Vania Valkova, director of the Bulgarian Interior Ministry press office, said that at least seven people were killed and about 30 wounded in the explosion in a parking lot outside Burgas Airport, on the Black Sea. The Foreign Ministry said six died and 32 people were wounded, with three in intensive care. The attack was probably initiated by a group under the auspices of ""either Iran or other radical Muslim groups,"" according to Barak, who cited Hezbollah and Hamas as likely suspects. ""We are in a continued fight against them. We are determined to identify who sent them, who executed (the attack) and to settle the account,"" Barak said. Bulgaria's foreign minister, Nikolay Mladenov, told CNN he presumes the explosion was a terrorist attack. But he said it was not time to ""starting assigning blame."" Bulgaria will ask the U.N. Security Council to condemn the attack, perhaps Thursday, said Mladenov, who traveled to the blast scene. The bus was scheduled to carry about 47 passengers to a resort. Bulgaria is a popular destination for Israelis. Another spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry said an explosive device may have been on the bus, but authorities cannot be sure. A forensic team has begun an investigation, she said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pointed to Iran, saying it has been behind a string of recent attempted attacks on Israelis in Thailand, India and Georgia, among others. ""All the signs (are) leading to Iran,"" he said, according to a statement from his office. ""This is a global Iranian terror onslaught and Israel will react firmly to it."" Michael Oren, Israel's ambassador to the United States, said his country was investigating the circumstances. ""We don't have proof of Iranian involvement but it is part of this pattern"" of plots around the world, he told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" The Iranian government had no immediate comment on the incident. Read Netanyahu's full statement . Bulgarian authorities also vowed to find out what happened. Israel's intelligence minister told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that Israel has ""very good indications"" Iran was involved. ""They are after us, Israelis, wherever they can find them,"" said Dan Meridor. Venelin Petkov, a reporter for bTV in Bulgaria, said that three of the wounded were in critical condition. The Bulgarian bus driver was among the dead, according to Valkova of the Bulgarian Interior Ministry. The Israelis had just arrived from Tel Aviv and were to have traveled to a beach resort about 50 kilometers (30 miles) away, he said. Security expert Ivan Boyadjiev told Bulgarian National Television that Israel had warned several months ago of the possibility of an attack on Israelis in Bulgaria. Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev said he met the head of Mossad, Israel's intelligence service, about two months ago. ""If we'd received any kind of information about this, it would have been taken very seriously,"" he told reporters. ""The fact that such an attack was carried out here and now should not be interpreted as to say that Bulgaria is not a safe country for tourists."" Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said he was not excluding the possibility that the explosion was a terrorist attack. ""I can assure you that we're doing all we can to strengthen security in all the areas where it might be necessary to do so,"" he said. U.S. President Barack Obama condemned what he called a ""barbaric terrorist attack."" ""As Israel has tragically once more been a target of terrorism, the United States reaffirms our unshakeable commitment to Israel's security, and our deep friendship and solidarity with the Israeli people,"" said Obama, who called Netanyahu to express his condolences. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was prepared to assist Bulgaria and Israel in bringing those responsible to justice. Neither she nor Obama mentioned Iran in their statements. The tourists' plane from Tel Aviv landed in Bulgaria at 5 p.m., the Israeli Foreign Ministry said. The flight carried 154 passengers, eight of them children. Oren Katz, who was with his wife and three children on a bus near the one that blew up, described a bloody scene. ""The moment we got on (the bus), we heard a very loud explosion. It was the third bus next to us. Everyone started running in all directions. There was a big chaos,"" he said. ""We took our children with us and ran as far as we could away from the explosion. My oldest daughter is handicapped, so I decided to run back in order to pick up her wheelchair. ""There was a big blaze of fire, and we were not allowed to come near. Suddenly, I noticed an unconscious woman laying next to me, very close to the burning bus. I picked her up together with another man, and we managed to drag her out of the fire that was about to catch her body in seconds. ""I cannot forget the sight of body parts scattered around the bus."" The travelers were on seven buses outside the terminal; they had arrived on the same flight from Israel, Katz said. The Israeli military said it would send a medical team to Bulgaria, which Oren called a hospitable vacation destination. Bulgarian President Rossen Plevneliev: . ""The fact that such an attack was carried out here and now should not be interpreted as to say that Bulgaria is not a safe country for tourists,"" said * . The explosion came on the 18th anniversary of an attack on a Jewish community center in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, in which 85 people were killed. Argentina's top prosecutor last year blamed Iran for the 1994 attack, which also wounded about 300 people. Israel also holds Iran responsible for the attack; Tehran has denied any connection to the bombing, which it has condemned. Tension between Iran and Israel has increased over the past year. Iran hanged a man who was convicted of killing one of its nuclear scientists, state-run Press TV reported in May. Majid Jamali Fashi was convicted of the January 2010 killing of Massoud Ali Mohammadi, an Iranian university professor and a nuclear scientist. He was also convicted of spying. Prosecutors accused him of working for the Mossad, and said he was paid $120,000 by Israel to carry out the hit. Israel typically does not comment on such claims. The killing was among a series of attacks against Iranian nuclear scientists in recent years. In January, Iran sent a letter to the United Nations secretary-general alleging that the killings of the scientists were terrorist attacks that followed a pattern. ""There is firm evidence that certain foreign quarters are behind such assassinations,"" the letter said. Iran's efforts to build a nuclear program have unnerved many world leaders, resulting in condemnation and sanctions from the United Nations. Tehran insists the program is for peaceful purposes. Israel, which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal and has expressed alarm over Tehran's hostility toward the Jewish state, has said it may attack Iran to try to stop the country from developing nuclear weapons.

"(CNN) -- Three suspected al Qaeda terrorists arrested last week in Spain appear to have been interested in targeting a Gibraltar-area shopping mall in a strike that was likely intended to coincide with the London Olympic Games, an analyst says. Police deduced this from the declaration of a paragliding instructor who had dealings with the group and the contents of a video they recovered from the suspects, according to Fernando Reinares, a senior international terrorism analyst who was briefed by Spanish security services on the investigation. ""Attacking in or near Gibraltar during the Olympic Games apparently was for them a feasible alternative to what they, and their corresponding organizational leadership, perceived as a much more difficult operation, that of attempting an act of terrorism in London,"" Reinares told CNN. While the planned execution date of their alleged plot is still not clear, any attack on or near British soil during the Olympic Games would have generated intense global publicity. Video: Preventing 7/7 style attack at Olympics . Spanish police believe that one of the targets of the alleged cell could have been a commercial complex named ""Puerta de Europa"" in Algeciras, just across the strait of Gibraltar from the British overseas territory, Reinares told CNN. Spanish security services suspect their plan may have been to attack the area around the British territory on the southernmost tip of Spain from the air, Reinares said. A paragliding instructor told police Saturday that Cengiz Yalcin, the alleged cell's Turkish facilitator, asked to be able to take pictures of a Gibraltar shopping mall ""at all cost,"" said Reinares. Spanish security suspect the cell was testing a remote-controlled plane as a potential bomber. Spanish investigators found a video in which Yalcin was flying a remote-controlled airplane, according to Reinares. The footage showed the plane, which was about three meters long, being maneuvered into a descent. Two packets were then seen dropping from either wing of the plane following his command. ""In the images he can't help expressing his joy for the successful try,"" Reinares told CNN. ""Terrorists innovate and adapt to security measures, we have to always keep this in mind,"" he added.

In July, Rezwan Ferdaus, a Massachusetts resident inspired by al Qaeda's ideology, pleaded guilty to a September 2011 plot to fly a remote-controlled plane into the Pentagon and U.S. capitol with high explosives. Two Chechen-Russians -- Eldar Magomedov, also known as Ahmad Avar, and Muhammad Adamov -- whom Spanish security services suspect had been tasked with carrying out an attack, were arrested on a bus traveling toward France. Investigating Judge Pablo Ruz ruled Sunday there was sufficient evidence to unconditionally detain both men. They were charged with membership in a terrorist group and possession or storage of explosives. Yalcin stands accused of possession of explosives substances. According to a statement released Sunday from Ruz, the Chechens hid their true identity after they were arrested, but Spanish authorities were able to establish their real names after help from Russian authorities. The judge noted that U.S. authorities and Gibraltar law enforcement also assisted the Spanish investigation. The arrests were announced Thursday. Experts say the men appear to have constituted one of the most skilled and experienced terrorist cells seen in recent times, and appear to have been dispatched by al Qaeda to carry out an ambitious attack in Europe. Magomedov, the suspected leader, was a former member of Spetsnaz, the Russian special forces, according to Spain's Interior Ministry. He had training as a sniper and was an expert in poisons, the ministry said. Reinares, of Madrid's Elcano Royal Institute, said that according to information passed to Spain by several Western intelligence agencies, Magomedov joined training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan, including camps run by Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, after leaving the Russian special forces outfits. According to this intelligence, between 2008 and 2011, Magomedov operated in the southwestern Russian republic of Dagestan and the Pakistani tribal districts of North and South Waziristan, transiting between them, Reinares said. Adamov, the other Chechen, had received explosives training in Afghanistan, where he become an expert in managing explosives and may have participated in a recent bomb attack in Moscow, according to Spanish authorities. According to Reinares, the French described the Chechens to their Spanish counterparts as ""really dangerous."" He said British intelligence services were also involved in tracking the suspected terrorist cell. Also found in Yalcin's home was equipment for three motorized paragliding machines. Yalcin told a Spanish investigating judge Friday that he was an enthusiast of motorized paragliding and wished to teach his two Chechen associates how to fly them. Reinares said Spanish security services have established that both Chechens received motor-paragliding lessons near La Linea and may have had some instruction before arriving in Spain. A paragliding hand book in Russian was found in their possession, Reinares said. French security services tipped off their Spanish counterparts about the probable arrival of the two Chechen suspected terrorists in May, according to Reinares. The French had been tracking the duo and monitoring their phone calls. At one point, they intercepted a phone call in which the Chechens described Spain as a ""more easy country to get explosives,"" Reinares said. Investigators moved to arrest all three men after the two Chechens appeared to be heading back to France by bus, concerned that France may be their target. One of them violently resisted arrest, the Spanish Interior Ministry reported.

"(CNN) -- Novelist Samantha Shannon has been heralded by book insiders as ""the next J.K. Rowling,"" and her debut, ""The Bone Season,"" compared with ""Harry Potter."" But the unassuming 21-year-old, who recently graduated from Oxford, would rather you didn't compare her to one of her favorite authors. ""Every writer wants to be as beloved as J.K.,"" Shannon said. ""But we don't need a 'new J.K.' because she is still writing and still amazing."" The publishing deal is the biggest similarity between the two writers: Six figures for seven books with Bloomsbury. But Shannon's adult novel, weaving in elements of fantasy and dystopia, is entirely different from the world of wizards and spells inhabited by Harry and his schoolmates. In ""The Bone Season,"" out this week, Shannon has built a stark world in 2059 London. The city is controlled by a security force named Scion. It has caused clairvoyants, like 19-year-old dreamwalker Paige Mahoney, to work in the criminal underworld because their talents are considered treasonous. After being captured, Paige wakes up in an even more powerful city controlled by Rephaim, humanoid creatures who kidnap the different kinds of voyants and train them for their army. Writing the novel between classes and a publishing internship, Shannon might sound like a tireless overachiever, and she is. Shannon had written two books by age 19, inked a multi-book deal at 20 and is now published at age 21. But her journey wasn't an overnight success story. Writer in the making . At 15 years old, Shannon was a precocious writer, putting down words before and after school for a ""romantic sci-fi epic"" called ""Aurora."" ""It followed an eighteen year-old female protagonist, who happens upon a wounded but devilishly-attractive alien and goes on a quest with him to find his eight lost companions"" Shannon wrote on her blog. She worked on the idea tirelessly, foregoing sleep to write. Her mother was ""beside herself with worry,"" she remembered. Shannon hand-delivered her manuscript to agencies all over London, but only rejection letters returned. Her passion for the idea died and her evenings held empty spaces. She picked up old writing projects and entered short story contests, but nothing could replace the fervor of working on a novel. The next step was following her passion for literature at Oxford. Although Shannon had submitted ""Aurora"" to David Godwin Associates literary agency, only to have it rejected, she ended up interning there when she was 19. The girl who loved London found herself in the city's junction of Seven Dials and Covent Garden. A couple of nearby shops sold tarot cards and crystal balls. ""I had this daydream about a girl having the same day at work as me in Seven Dials, but she happened to be clairvoyant and the idea stuck in my head,"" Shannon said. ""On my lunch breaks, I would plan out clairvoyant types."" By the end of the internship, Shannon had a new synopsis. She couldn't stop writing. Trying to fit a particular genre or audience never entered her mind. It became clear that ""Aurora"" was a practice novel, where she could identify her strengths and weaknesses. Now she could turn her gift for story building into a saga. ""I'm often daydreaming and it's because I've always liked the idea of there being something more than the normal world. So I wanted my readers to feel like there is a big world to explore, and I will help them into it."" 5 questions for 'Night Film' author Marisha Pessl . A second chance . During the day, Shannon studied literature, film criticism and Emily Dickinson. Working on ""The Bone Season"" was ""like an extracurricular activity, except more intense and personal."" Shannon showed the work to author Ali Smith, also in Oxford. Smith suggested she send it to an agent, and David Godwin once again entered the picture. ""I thought it was very well created,"" Godwin said. ""The books aren't just elaborate stories that have no root in the world. That gives it much more authority."" Bloomsbury, like Godwin, tends to pursue a more literary list, eschewing fantasy novels, but they became immersed in a world they never could have imagined. ""There was this incredible instant visceral reaction to reading these pages and feeling like we were sucked into this world that's so real with these characters that jumped off the page and a narrative that just never stopped,"" Nancy Miller, Bloomsbury's U.S. editorial director, said. ""And she is the most down-to-earth person I've ever met. I keep wondering, where did this come from? How did she do this? I'm amazed at how young she is."" Term papers and novel drafts . Shannon's family didn't even know the book existed until she called to tell them about the deal with Bloomsbury. Meanwhile, U.S. editor Rachel Mannheimer was impressed with the quick edits Shannon returned in between writing term papers and taking exams. Even though Shannon was 19 at the time, the same age as her character, she kept a narrative distance that read older than her years. Mannheimer was also taken in by Shannon's skill with creating a futuristic world on the page, especially as a reader who didn't typically subscribe to fantasy. ""It was fun to be one of the first people to be let into that world, and to be part of figuring out its contours and its rules,"" Mannheimer said. The biggest challenge was withholding some details to guide readers without overwhelming them. Reviews in The Examiner and USA Today criticized ""The Bone Season"" for dumping too many facts on the reader and deploying so many confusing names. A Telegraph reviewer agreed but added that Shannon ""writes so well that you stay interested."" ""Even in the first chapter, there is probably too much information thrown at you,"" Shannon admitted. ""I do take this insane pleasure in world-building. I get the world in my head, but I have to make sure everyone else gets it."" Only to grow . ""The Bone Season"" isn't being marketed as the next young adult must-read, a la ""Hunger Games,"" despite main character Paige Mahoney's youth. The expected audience is broad: young to old, men and women, fantasy and non-fantasy readers. ""We published it the way we know how, as a really special novel,"" Mannheimer said. ""The protagonist may start out at 19, but there are six more books to come. Samantha will mature and her character will, too. Starting out in the adult market, readers can grow with the protagonist and she, as an author, has more room to explore serious themes."" Shannon is relieved now that Warden, one of the main characters, is out in the world. The only surviving character from ""Aurora"" has been with her for years. And soon, Warden could come to life on the big screen. The Imaginarium Studios have secured the film rights to the book. Shannon has consultation rights, which she hopes to explore given her deep interest in film. She is already six chapters into the second book, exploring more of Scion London. ""I think the books will get better and better,"" Godwin said. ""I think there is no stopping this girl and it's incredibly important to her, the writing. All good writers, they like writing best, it's when they are the most themselves. She's obsessive, and that's good."" Follow Ashley Strickland on Twitter: @CNNAshley .","Samantha Shannon and J.K.

"(CNN) -- The 12-year-old Arkansas girl who was infected with a rare brain-eating parasite is showing remarkable improvement, her doctors said Tuesday. Kali Hardig is still listed in critical condition at Arkansas Children's Hospital, but over the past 48 hours, she's grown alert to the point where she can gesture in response to questions, according to Dr. Mark Heulitt, an intensive care specialist. Heulitt has scheduled a test for Tuesday afternoon to see whether Hardig can breathe without the breathing tube that she's had for more than two weeks. Hardig's doctors are in virtually uncharted territory. Of 128 known cases in the past half-century, just two patients have survived, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The infection is caused by a microscopic amoeba called Naegleria fowleri, found in hot springs and warm, fresh water, most often in the southeastern United States. The amoeba enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. You cannot be infected with the organism by drinking contaminated water, the CDC says. ""This infection is one of the most severe infections that we know of,"" Dr. Dirk Haselow of the Arkansas Department of Health told CNN affiliate WMC. ""Ninety-nine percent of people who get it die."" Why 'nightmare bacteria' on the rise . Dr. Sanjiv Pasala, one of Hardig's attending physicians, says they immediately started treating Hardig with an antifungal medicine, antibiotics and a new experimental anti-amoeba drug doctors got directly from the CDC. They also reduced the girl's body temperature to 93 degrees. Doctors have used that technique in some brain injury cases as a way to preserve undamaged brain tissue. Last week, doctors checked the girl's cerebral spinal fluid and could not find any presence of the amoeba. Pasala said that while other cases have not met with such favorable results, what may have made a real difference is that the girl's mother got her to the hospital so quickly. Willow Springs Water Park in Little Rock is the most likely source of Hardig's infection, according to a news release from the Arkansas Department of Health. Another case of the same parasite, also called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, was reported in 2010 and was possibly linked to Willow Springs. ""Based on the occurrence of two cases of this rare infection in association with the same body of water and the unique features of the park, the ADH has asked the owner of Willow Springs to voluntarily close the water park to ensure the health and safety of the public,"" the news release said. What's in your pool water? The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection, including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to the CDC. ""Later symptoms include confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations,"" the government agency's website states. ""After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days."" Getting this amoeba is extremely rare. Between 2001 and 2010, there were 32 reported cases in the United States, the CDC says. Most of the cases occurred in the Southeast. Here are some tips from the CDC to help lower your risk of infection: . ‚Ä¢ Avoid swimming in fresh water when the water temperature is high and the water level is low. ‚Ä¢ Hold your nose shut or use nose clips. ‚Ä¢ Avoid stirring up the sediment while wading in shallow, warm freshwater areas. ‚Ä¢ If you are irrigating, flushing or rinsing your sinuses (for example, by using a neti pot), use water that has been distilled or sterilized. CNN's John Bonifield and Caleb Hellerman contributed to this story.","Kali Hardig, 12, is in critical condition at Arkansas Children's Hospital .

"(CNN) -- The news that Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, is pregnant is being celebrated throughout Britain, the British Commonwealth and beyond. As well as wonderful news for the royal couple, it has positive implications for the future of the British monarchy. It means that the reigning House of Windsor will have, for the first time since 1894, no fewer than three generations in line to the throne at the same time. As early into this century as we are, it effectively means that the succession is secure even into the next one. Whether the royal couple's new baby is a boy or a girl, he or she will ascend the throne as monarch one day, come what may -- short of a republican revolution. The Commonwealth changed the law this year, meaning sex discrimination will end and males will not be favored over females, as they have been for the past thousand years. News: Baby news sparks media frenzy . Although we can't know what the child's name will be, we can be sure that he or she will have a lot of them: Some heirs to the throne had as many as seven or eight. Should they have a girl, it would be surprising if the names Elizabeth, after her great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II and great-great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and Diana, after her paternal grandmother, are missing from the list. Yet the bookmakers' predictions for a boy's name -- Charles, at 10 to 1; and John, at 8 to 1 -- are very unlikely. Charles is already taken as the name of Prince William's father, and John was one of the worst kings in British history. Any concerns that Prince Harry might one day have ascended the British throne -- he was third in line and will soon be fourth -- have been allayed by this announcement. Granted, he was a brave soldier who saw action fighting against the Taliban in Afghanistan, but he was not really considered suitable material for a king. The knowledge that Catherine can have children removes the danger that a future King Harry might embarrass the nation with his naked hijinks and Las Vegas antics. What we do know is that the child will be brought up in the harshest of media spotlights and will remain in its full flood for a lifetime. Bookmakers already are taking bets on the color of the baby's hair. To exist in this gilded cage will require a firm sense of self and a strong personality. Many people might be hurt psychologically by the relentless publicity accompanying every move they make, but Prince William has demonstrated that such attention does not necessarily lead to problems. News: Royal baby announcement marks dramatic break with tradition . The British state is far more protective toward its royals than it was in the days of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and it is fully conscious of the disasters that can arise when the paparazzi are in full pursuit. The public, too, despises those who invade the younger royals' private lives, although admittedly that has not stopped people from buying the newspapers and visiting the websites responsible for the worst excesses. In a sense, all monarchy is a lottery, in that nobody can tell whether a sovereign will turn out well or ill. A large number of the best ones -- Elizabeth I, Queen Victoria, George V, George VI, Elizabeth II -- were not necessarily going to be king or queen when they were born. Some who were born to be king -- such as Edward VIII, later Duke of Windsor -- turned out to be disappointments. With Elizabeth II, Britain won the lottery, and it seems as though the present popularity of the monarchy itself, which opinion polls show to be at its highest in more than a quarter-century, is very much down to her and Prince William. Although 1992 was an ""annus horribilis"" for the queen, when Windsor Castle suffered a terrible fire and two of her children's marriages collapsed, 2012 has been a wonderful 12 months, more than making up for it two decades later. The Diamond Jubilee was spectacular, proving yet again how much the British people love her. The London Olympics were a huge success. And the future of her dynasty seems on the verge of being confirmed throughout this century and beyond. There will be talk, inevitably, of whether the queen or perhaps the future King Charles III might abdicate, to avoid a situation in which the next three monarchs will be advanced in years. This will not happen. If the queen has inherited her mother's longevity, she will easily beat Queen Victoria's time on the throne, and become -- in September 2015 -- the longest-reigning monarch in history. Abdication is not in her job description: She considers it a dereliction of duty, something that disgraced her uncle King Edward VIII with the family. If she lives as long as the Queen Mother, she will still be on the throne in 2027, which will almost inevitably mean that her successor King Charles III would have one of the shorter reigns, as he would be nearly 80 when he acceded. Arguments about elderly monarchs have been made before in the reign of Queen Victoria, yet it didn't prevent the present queen coming to the throne aged only 25 only half a century later, after the deaths of three more monarchs in the meantime. Part of the lottery of monarchy is that one cannot predict the future, and the job only makes sense if it is for life. One of the strengths of having a family serve as successive heads of state is that when a bad chapter ends, a better one can begin. With the birth of what would have been her first grandchild, the shade of Princess Diana's era is forever behind the House of Windsor, and the British people can look forward to a new generation of royals. Small wonder that Britain and the world are celebrating with William and Kate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Roberts.","Andrew Roberts: When royal baby is born, three generations will be in line to the throne .

"London (CNN) -- Amid all the excitement and wall-to-wall media coverage about the eagerly-awaited new addition to the royal family, you may think you know all you could ever want to about royal babies. But did you know... A government minister used to be present at royal births, to make sure the baby was not switched . The practice is believed to have begun in 1688, when dozens of officials watched Mary of Modena, wife of James II, give birth to a son, to scotch rumors that Mary was not really pregnant and that the baby was to be smuggled into the room in a bedpan. The tradition continued well into the 20th century. The last royal birth to be witnessed by a government minister was that of Queen Elizabeth II's cousin, Princess Alexandra in 1936, and the practice was only officially halted shortly before the birth of Prince Charles in 1948. Royal husbands have not always attended the birth of their children . Queen Elizabeth II may not have had to contend with ministerial interference in her birth plan, but she also didn't have her husband there for support; while she gave birth to Prince Charles, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh was busy playing squash. Prince Charles was on hand when Diana had Prince William, but William himself may not be there for his own child's birth -- expected any day now -- if he's at work as a search-and-rescue pilot when the big moment arrives. If for any reason William can't get to the hospital on time, the Duchess of Cambridge is reported to have asked her mother, Carole Middleton, to be there to support her. Queen Victoria was the first royal to use anesthesia in childbirth . The long-reigning monarch and mother-of-nine was given chloroform for pain relief during the births of her eighth and ninth children, Prince Leopold (born in 1853) and Princess Beatrice (born in 1857). Her decision to opt for an anesthetic is credited with popularizing the use of painkillers during childbirth among the well-to-do of the time. John Snow, the doctor who administered the drug, is better known as one of the founding fathers of epidemiology, after he traced a deadly outbreak of cholera to a Soho water pump. Read more: Q&A - The royal baby's arrival . Prince William was the first heir to the throne to be born in hospital . William was born in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, on June 21, 1982. His brother was born at the same hospital two years later, and William's new son or daughter is also expected to come into the world there. While that might seem the normal way of things, in fact it was something of a break with tradition -- until then, all heirs to the throne had been born at home (or at one of the royal family's homes at least). Prince Charles was born at Buckingham Palace; Elizabeth II herself was born in the Mayfair home of her grandfather in 1926 -- though at the time she was not expected to become queen as her uncle, and not her father, was next in line to the throne. Titled royal babies do not have surnames . Members of the royal family are famously burdened with plenty of names -- Prince William was christened William Arthur Philip Louis, and his father is Charles Philip Arthur George -- but many (those titled His or Her Royal Highness) do not have a surname. Prince William and Prince Harry have used ""Wales"" at school and during their military careers, but this comes from their father's official title as Prince of Wales. William and Kate may continue to use this for their new baby. As descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh, they could also use Windsor, or Mountbatten-Windsor -- both of which are relatively new inventions, adopted during World War I to disguise the family's German origins. Alternatively, the royal parents-to-be could even opt to found their own dynasty, using ""Cambridge"" as a surname.

"(CNN) -- Does the singer come first? Or the songwriter? Let's start with the songs: ""Crazy."" ""Hello Walls."" ""Funny How Time Slips Away."" ""Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground.""

Just the catalogue alone would qualify him for any number of musical halls of fame -- and, indeed, Willie Nelson is in the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Kennedy Center Honors. He has a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Country Music Association, the first it ever presented. They decided to name it for him. Then there's the voice, that baritone as smooth as fine whiskey, capable of jaunty sing-alongs, angry despair, pensive melancholy. Amazingly, his delivery was once considered too unusual for Nashville, with a start-stop phrasing that skipped around the beat. Now it's as welcome as his other voice, the well-worn Martin N-20 acoustic guitar he calls ""Trigger."" Add to that Willie Nelson the man. He's the man who co-created Farm Aid, the annual festival that has raised more than $43 million to help farm families. (That got him into the Agricultural Hall of Fame.) He started BioWillie, which makes fuel out of soy and vegetable oils. He has a street named for him in Austin, Texas, his home since the early 1970s. He's still at it, raising money for the victims of the West, Texas, explosion. West is not far from Abbott, where Nelson was born. OK, Willie Nelson isn't without flaw. He's been busted for marijuana on more than one occasion. He hasn't always been faithful to his wives; his first one famously tied a passed-out Nelson in a bedsheet and beat him with a broom handle. He had a little tax problem with the IRS and put out a 1992 album called ""The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?"" to pay his multimillion-dollar debts. But who would want a flawless Willie Nelson? On Tuesday, Willie Nelson turns 80. (Some well-known friends -- and everyday fans -- sent him their wishes.) He'll be playing music, of course -- the Germain Arena in Estero, Florida, according to his website. What else would he do? ""I seem to be happier when I'm working,"" he told The New York Times in 1995. ""I tend to get into trouble with too much time on my hands."" That's OK, Willie.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- As European financial markets close for the spring celebration of May Day, protesters across Europe and beyond have taken to the streets to demonstrate for workers' rights and, in many cases, against painful austerity measures. In Istanbul, Turkey, riot police gassed and fired water cannons at dozens of demonstrators trying to get to the popular-tourist destination of Taksim Square for May 1 demonstrations. Groups carrying May 1 international Workers' Day banners and chanting ""Longlive Workers' Day"" while trying to the square were dispersed using water cannons and tear gas in Istanbul's Besiktas district. Istanbul is now on a citywide shut down. Traffic has been restricted and public transportation to the square has been suspended including subways, metrobuses as well as ferry services that connect the city's European side to the Asian side. ""We are expecting a problematic May 1,"" said Istanbul Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu told broadcaster CNNTurk. ""It would have been easy to solve this,"" he said.

She added that many Greeks at home are pinning their hopes on Samaras retracting some of the government's harsh austerity measures while reducing domestic bureaucracy to encourage foreign investment. Spain and Italy -- two other countries blighted by the eurozone debt crisis -- have also seen demonstrations on the streets. In the Spanish capital Madrid and the country's second city, Barcelona, thousands of protesters marched with some displaying signs 'Bread and shelter at fair price!' Some denounced Bankia, Spain's fourth-largest and partially state-owned bank that requested a 19 billion euro bailout in 2012. Other signs read: ""Where is our money? Swindlers."" Francisco Carrizo, 37, a Venezuelan teacher from Madrid, told CNN that people in Spain don't feel like celebrating May Day because unemployment is so high and the ""government should be ashamed."" In 2007, before the global economic crisis hit, Spain had 1.9 million people unemployed -- 8.6% of the active population. That figure has now risen to 6.2 million. Figures from Instituto Nacional de Estad√É¬≠stica, Spain's national statistics office, showed unemployment among 16 to 24 year-olds is at 57.2%. Joblessness is higher among women than men. Carizzo told CNN: ""I feel kind of bad because in my case I have two jobs. It's the sort of thing I don't usually tell people. I feel sad, let down and I have mixed feelings about it."" He added: ""There are people who are having a really hard time."" High unemployment and cuts to the public sector are being felt in Italy too. Unemployment reached 11% in March, while the country remained in political deadlock since the elections in February failed to yield a government. May Day protests have reportedly taken place in Rome as well as Bologna and Parma in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy. Read more: Italian lower house approves new government .

"(CNN) -- Pakistani soldiers have been sent to a prison in northern Pakistan amid concerns that militants might try to release high-profile prisoners, according to a senior Pakistani intelligence source who spoke on condition of anonymity on Tuesday. The prisoners at Peshawar's central prison include high-profile Pakistani-Taliban militants as well as Dr. Shakil Afridi, a Pakistani physician accused of helping the United States find al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden prior to his death two years ago. Officials received intelligence indicating that militants could be planning a jailbreak there, security sources said on condition of anonymity. The senior intelligence source said the army deployed soldiers to the Peshawar prison at the invitation of provincial authorities. Bolstering security at the Peshawar prison comes about a week after Taliban gunmen freed about 250 inmates -- including about 35 high-profile militants -- from a prison in the city of Dera Ismail Khan, about 185 miles (300 kilometers) south of Peshawar, authorities said. About 40 inmates were recaptured by Wednesday, but all of the high-profile militants remained on the loose, a prison official said on condition of anonymity last week. Since the Dera Ismail Khan jailbreak, intelligence agencies have warned that more attacks on Pakistani jails holding high-profile prisoners could occur. The Pakistani prison break and a series of similar incidents linked to al Qaeda that freed convicted or suspected terrorists in Iraq and Libya were factors in the U.S. decision to close embassies and consulates this week across Africa and the Middle East and issue a worldwide travel alert. Pakistani authorities accused Afridi of working with the CIA to set up a fake vaccination campaign in Abbottabad to try verify bin Laden's whereabouts. U.S. special forces killed the al Qaeda leader at an Abbottabad compound in May 2011. Afridi was convicted of treason in Pakistan and is serving a 33-year sentence. Pakistani-Taliban inmates at the Peshawar facility include the group's former spokesman, Muslim Khan, and a number of high-ranking commanders from Swat and Bajaur.

"(CNN) -- Gamescom brings video game fans, developers and companies together in one place to discover what's new, and what's coming, in the gaming industry. Held in Cologne, Germany, the event is billed as the world's largest trade fair for interactive games and entertainment. Boasting 275,000 visitors in its third year, the gathering, which opens Wednesday, has been a place for gaming companies to show off their new products and for fans to get their first experience with new titles. With their next-generation video game consoles scheduled for release later this year, Sony and Microsoft are expected to reveal what games can be played on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One respectively. But there are always surprises at Gamescom, and this year will surely be no different. Sony continues to roll along after an outstanding showing at E3 in Los Angeles earlier this summer. Unveiling new games for the portable PS Vita, as well as the new PlayStation 4, Sony also made a point of showcasing a wide variety of independent games that will be coming to the new console. The company has now announced launch dates for the PlayStation 4 -- November 15 in North America and November 29 in Europe. The new console is expected to be in 32 countries at launch. Sony also lowered the price on the PS Vita ($199) and is making a 12GB PlayStation 3 available for a relatively meager $199. Microsoft is showing off its Xbox One lineup at Gamescom, featuring 51 new games (including 20 at console launch) with many being exclusive titles or having exclusive content for the new home console. Attendees will have the chance for hands-on experience with ""Ryse: Son of Rome,"" ""Dead Rising 3,"" and ""Forza Motorsport 5"" among others. Gaming companies will be making ""surprise"" announcements at the event to showcase their new titles -- and possibly tip their hands about the directions they expect to go in the near future. Many companies also are attempting to bridge the coming console generation gap by letting customers upgrade their games from current-generation to next-generation for a small fee. UbiSoft will introduce a new fighting game designed specifically for the Xbox One, ""Fighter Within."" The new game aims to provide realistic fighting competition by using the Kinect controller and giving players more precision and responsiveness. This game is destined to get players moving, sweating and involved as they battle against their friends. The 1-to-1 motion tracking with Kinect should deliver realistic moves and ""injuries."" Blizzard took this opportunity to announce additional content for its popular ""Diablo 3"" game. Called ""Reaper of Souls,"" the new content aims to give players the experience many have been clamoring for since the release of the game. ""Reaper of Souls"" will have a new melee class, more monsters and environments, and, of course, new loot. ""Diablo 3"" will be making its console debut this fall on current generation and next-gen consoles. Fresh off the success of ""XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"" 2K Games wants players to take another plunge into the world where you defend Earth against alien invaders. ""XCOM: Enemy Within"" will be announced at Gamescom and offers upgraded weapons, abilities and enemies in the battle for the future. More than just an expansion pack, it will enable players to actually utilize alien technology -- making their squads more than human. While the endgame is still the same, how you get there radically changes with the new tactical elements. Electronic Arts, Warner Bros. Interactive, Activision, Bethesda and many others are also at the show, touting new features to games previously announced. Many of the new games will be playable at the event, which is why so many fans flock to Germany for a taste.","Gamescom opens in Germany on Wednesday .

"(LifeWire)  -- Fifty years ago this Saturday, Laika -- a sweet-tempered stray plucked off the streets of Moscow  -- was thrust into the global spotlight when she became the first living creature sent into space. A Newfoundland,  like this champion named Josh, saved the life of Napoleon Bonaparte. When Sputnik 2's canine passenger (nicknamed ""Muttnik"" by the media) hit orbit, the Soviet Union grabbed the edge over the U.S. in the space race, a crux of competition during the Cold War. Sadly, Laika's history-making voyage ended prematurely: In their rush to be first, Soviet scientists had made no provisions for her safe return. ""She died before reaching orbit, and before any real data was gleaned about sustaining life in that environment,"" says Dr. Stanley Coren, professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia and author of ""The Pawprints of History: Dogs and the Course of Human Events."" But if little scientific knowledge was gleaned from Laika's journey, her mark on world events is undeniable. ""We were behind the Russians,"" says Coren. ""The U.S. quickly switched focus to putting a living being on the moon."" Laika is just one of the many canines to have left a furry legacy behind. Coren names 10 other dogs and the roles they played in history. Nos. 1 and 2. Strelka and Belka's successful orbit . Laika was the first dog sent into space, but Strelka (Little Arrow) and Belka  (Squirrel) -- launched on Sputnik 5 in 1960 for a one-day mission -- were the first to return alive. As a result, much more was learned from their mission. Strelka later gave birth to a litter of puppies, one of which, Pushinka, was given to President John F. Kennedy's daughter, Caroline. No. 3. How Peritas saved civilization . Without his dog, Peritas, Alexander the Great might have been Alexander the So-So. When the warrior was swarmed by the troops of Persia's Darius III, Peritas leapt and bit the lip of an elephant charging his master. Alexander lived to pursue his famed conquest, forging the empire underlying Western civilization as we know it. No. 4. Charlie, Kennedy's Cuban Missile Crisis companion . At the height of 1962's Cuban missile crisis, President Kennedy had his son's Welsh terrier Charlie summoned to the chaotic War Room. The president held the terrier in his lap, petting him and appearing, by all accounts, to relax. Eventually he announced that he was ready to ""make some decisions"" -- those that de-escalated the conflict. No. 5. Jofi, the first therapy dog . Sigmund Freud usually kept a chow named Jofi in his office during psychotherapy sessions, believing the dog comforted the patients. Freud's notes on these interactions, detailed in his diaries, form the basis of modern-day pet-assisted therapy.  Dog returned to fire victims ¬ª . No. 6. Urian bites Pope, separates church and state . Henry VIII sent Cardinal Wolsey to meet with Pope Clement VII, hoping the pontiff would grant the ruler an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. When the pope extended his bare toe to be kissed (as was the custom) by Wolsey, the Cardinal's dog, Urian, sprang forward and bit the pope. Clement flew into a rage, the divorce was off and Henry -- to ensure the annulment the Catholic Church refused to grant -- later established the Church of England. No. 7. Newfoundland saves Napoleon . Napoleon Bonaparte owed his life to a nameless Newfoundland. As Bonaparte fled the island of Elba in 1815, where he was exiled, choppy seas pitched him overboard. A fisherman's dog jumped in after the drowning despot and kept him afloat. Napoleon lived to experience his own defeat at the Battle of Waterloo. No. 8. Nixon professes love for Checkers . In his 1952 ""Checkers speech,"" Richard Nixon -- then a candidate for vice president who was accused of pawing $18,000 in illegal campaign contributions -- admitted to accepting an American cocker spaniel, Checkers, as a gift. ""And you know, the kids, like all kids, loved the dog, and I just want to say this, right now, that regardless of what they say about it, we are going to keep it,"" Nixon said during his famous speech. His heartfelt proclamation swayed public opinion and prolonged Nixon's political career. No. 9. Peps, Wagner's harshest critic . Without Peps, composer Richard Wagner's Cavalier King Charles spaniel, that helicopter scene in the film ""Apocalypse Now"" (scored to ""The Ride of the Valkyries"") might sound very different. Wagner would have Peps sit on a special chair as he played his latest compositions and, based upon the dog's reactions, he'd keep or toss each passage. No. 10. Donnchadh and the American Revolution . In 1306, when Edward I of England sought to bring down Robert the Bruce (and his ploy to rule Scotland), his men used Robert's own dog, Donnchadh, to find him. Though the animal led them to their target, he then turned and defended his master, who lived to become king of Scotland and produce a daughter who married into the Stuart family. Many generations later, the irrational actions of Robert the Bruce's direct descendant, King George III, would cause the American colonists to rebel. Modern medicine attributes King George's apparent madness to porphyria, a genetically transmitted disease that researchers trace back to the Scottish Stuarts. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Tim Hill still remembers the sound of wood popping as his house's attic burned. His brother, he says, had tried to set the home ablaze with eight people inside. He also remembers the time when his mother awakened to a ghastly sight: his brother standing over her with a butcher knife. And he remembers the message his brother sent him on Facebook, threatening to kill him. When he heard that his brother, Michael Brandon Hill, had been accused of opening fire with an AK-47 inside a Georgia elementary school this week, Tim Hill said he was just ""a little bit"" surprised. ""Over the years of growing up with him, it almost seemed like eventually he would do something like this,"" he told CNN's Piers Morgan Live in an exclusive interview Thursday. ""But not to this magnitude."" Authorities allege that Hill, 20, had about 500 rounds of ammunition when he entered the Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy outside Atlanta on Tuesday. He barricaded himself in the front office, fired one shot inside the school and several more at police officers outside before he eventually surrendered, police said. Ultimately, no one was injured. How did it come to this? Tim Hill suggests that the system failed his family. ""I feel like there's just a whole lot more they could have done,"" he told CNN. He said his younger brother used to be a normal kid. But something happened. ""Everything just started changing after doctors started messing with his medicines here and there and changing it up and putting him on a different one and institutionalized him multiple times to correct his medicine,"" he said. ""It just escalated from there."" As the years went by, Tim Hill said he and other family members felt increasingly helpless. ""I felt hopeless at helping him,"" he said. ""I tried many times growing up as a teenager to sit him down an talk to him."" But his advice never stuck. And earlier this year, his brother was arrested in March on a charge of ""terroristic threats and acts"" after threatening to kill him. After pleading guilty to that charge, Michael Brandon Hill was sentenced in July to serve three years of probation and attend anger management classes as part of a plea agreement, according to Henry County court records. It's not clear whether he started the classes. Henry County District Attorney James Wright said Wednesday there is no indication he has completed them. Tim Hill said Thursday that he isn't sure whether he'll ever speak to his brother again. He said hopes the situation will be a reminder to people in the political, mental health and legal systems that more needs to be done. People like his brother ""need to be looked at more closely,"" he said. ""They need to be given more help,"" Tim Hill said, ""instead of pushed to the side because the doctor thinks they're well."" CNN's David Mattingly, Martin Savidge and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Brother: ""It almost seemed like eventually he would do something like this""

"(CNN) -- New Zealand is perceived as the least corrupt nation on earth, and Somalia and North Korea are seen as the most corrupt, a German watchdog organization said in a report released this week. The United States ranked 24th least corrupt on a ""corruption perceptions index,"" the fifth-best in the Western Hemisphere. Canada ranked 10th, Barbados is 16th, the Bahamas is 21st and Chile is 22nd. Overall, the top spots are occupied mostly by European countries, with the exception of New Zealand, Singapore at No. 5 and Australia, which is tied for eighth with Switzerland. Other nations with top rankings are Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands. In addition to Somalia and North Korea, which are tied for last at No. 182, the bottom of the list includes Myanmar, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Sudan, Iraq, Haiti and Venezuela. The report was prepared by the independent, nonpartisan Transparency International organization, which says it drew its conclusions based ""on different assessments and business opinion surveys carried out by independent and reputable institutions."" The information used to compile the index includes ""questions relating to the bribery of public officials, kickbacks in public procurement, embezzlement of public funds and questions that probe the strength and effectiveness of public-sector and anti-corruption efforts,"" Transparency International said. Perceptions are used, the organization said, because corruption is a hidden activity that is difficult to measure. ""Over time,"" the organization said in its report, ""perceptions have proved to be a reliable estimate of corruption."" The rankings for other Western Hemisphere countries are: Uruguay (25), Puerto Rico (39), Costa Rica (50), Cuba (61), Brazil (73), Colombia, El Salvador and Peru (tied for 80), Panama (86), Argentina and Mexico (tied for 100), Bolivia (118), Ecuador and Guatemala (tied for 120), the Dominican Republic and Honduras (tied for 129), Nicaragua (134), Paraguay (154), Venezuela (172) and Haiti (175). The index uses a scale of 0-10 to measure perceived corruption, with zero representing highly corrupt and 10 being very clean. New Zealand, the highest-ranked nation, has a 9.5 score. Somalia and North Korea, the lowest-ranked, have 1.0. The United States scored 7.1, while Canada is 8.7 and Chile is 7.2. Haiti, the lowest-ranked nation in the Western Hemisphere, scored 1.8. Next-worst is Venezuela with 1.9. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Turkey is ranked highest at 61 with 4.2 on the scale, and Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are lowest, tied for 177 with a 1.6 index value.

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid Football Club has unveiled world-record transfer signing Gareth Bale to thousands of fans inside the Bernabeu Stadium. The former Tottenham Hotspur winger, who cost the Spanish giants a reported $132 million (√Ç¬£85 million), was officially welcomed by Real Madrid President Florentino Perez at a press conference on Monday. The 24-year-old said it was ""absolutely amazing"" to have joined the Spanish giants adding he hoped to help the team to success and win a 10th European Cup this season. A suited Bale then changed into his new kit before stepping out on to the pitch to greet hoards of adoring Madrid fans.

""I highlight the physical condition he is in. He arrives at the club a physical marvel and we think he will serve the club well,"" he added.

""I am not sure there is ever a good time to leave a club where I felt settled and was playing the best football of my career to date,"" Bale's statement read. ""I know many players talk of their desire to join the club of their boyhood dreams, but I can honestly say, this is my dream come true."" Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy said it was never his wish to sell Bale, but the club were forced to bow to the inevitable.

"(CNN) -- Planning a road trip vacation can be tricky and downright frightening for people who are susceptible to carsickness. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta says motion sickness is ""paralyzing"" and sometimes leaves him ""incapacitated."" Once the illness settles in, even the most soothing scenery whizzing past a car window will be no match for the symptoms: nausea, sweating, racing heart and difficulty breathing. It's a subject all too familiar to CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who spoke with CNN.com about his own history of acute carsickness and how sufferers can treat it. CNN: What happens in the body when someone experiences carsickness or motion sickness?  Watch what you can do to fight carsickness ¬ª . Gupta: Basically, everything in your body, all your senses are activating at the same time. If there is some sort of mismatch between your senses, say your eyes are telling you that you're moving -- or not -- and your ears are telling you [the opposite] and for some reason they're not connecting, you start to get what's called disequilibrium, or motion sickness. And it's the body's response of telling you ""something is not quite right here."" CNN: So what part of that disconnect is most likely to make you feel motion sickness? Gupta: The inner ear is probably the biggest culprit, mainly because you literally have these bones in the inner ear and these fluid-filled canals that detect your motion, and they are constantly giving you feedback right to your brain stem about what your position in space is. It's called proprioception, and that is the ability to know your place in space. CNN: Are there other circumstances, besides riding in cars, which make people feel motion sick? Gupta: Certainly there are certain things that are designed to do that, big theaters where you feel like you're moving but you're actually stationary in a chair, IMAX theaters for example. Besides car rides, boat rides can certainly do that and are probably the biggest culprit. Amusement park rides, that sort of thing as well. CNN: Can anyone get motion sickness? Gupta: You know it's funny, I think that probably anybody could get motion sickness. [When I rode] with the Blue Angels, I was talking to some of the pilots ahead of time, because I know that I'm pretty prone to motion sickness. I have certain techniques that I've taught myself so that I can ward off some of the awful symptoms. But some of the pilots I was talking to said they never -- and these are Naval pilots they go on boats and they fly planes: two things that you could really be subjected to it -- and they said that they've never been motion sick, which I thought was kind of interesting. The trainer of the pilots said all of these guys on their first couple of rides lost their cookies, at least once. CNN: Are some people more likely than others to get motion sickness? Gupta: People who have some sort of inner ear problem, we know that that can be an issue. Someone who has difficulty with their vision is more likely to have that mismatch between what they see and what they're feeling in their inner ear. Diabetics -- because they have numbness in the feet -- often times won't be able to tell if they're moving when they are, so they'll get a mismatch. There have been some studies that have shown that genetics play a role so that if your mother gets motion sick, you're more likely to, but ... there's a pretty weak association, genetically. CNN: What does carsickness feel like for you? Gupta: It is an awful feeling. It is paralyzing, really, for me. I go to New York a lot, and the ride from La Guardia to Time Warner Center ... it's a quick ride. And I need to be ready to go when I get there. If I'm having a bad ride, I am pretty much incapacitated for a good half an hour, 40 minutes after I get there. And it is all those things: I get sweaty, I feel really sick to my stomach, I feel like I'm going to throw up, I can't think straight, I can't even talk on the phone at that time because any kind of stimulus just really throws me off. And what's interesting is I never know exactly what to do. I think if the symptoms have already started, then a lot of times I'll try to lie down and close my eyes, basically taking away one of the sensory stimuli, the vision. But you get a lot of starting and stopping and that can make it a lot worse. So it is pretty bad, and it's actually a real problem. I have to do certain things now. I have to sit in the front seat. Sometimes I'll ask the guys to let me drive. I'll drive even in New York, because I don't get sick when I drive. All your senses are firing on the same level when you're driving the car. I open the windows, even in the colder weather to get some fresh air. That seems to help. Sometimes I will eat something that's calming on my stomach beforehand so I at least don't get the nausea associated with it. It's very problematic for me. It's like a migraine. If I get there, if I allow myself to get to the point where I'm motion sick, then I'm pretty much toast. I'm going to have a bad 45 minutes or so. CNN: Why is it best to sit in the front seat as a passenger if you get carsick? Gupta: I do that because you're able to look at those things moving around you, you have much more window space, you're able to have a sense of what the driver's doing. So if the driver's hitting the brakes, you see that happening and it matches up with your inner ear. If you're sitting in the backseat and all of the sudden the driver hits the brakes, you get that queasy feeling in your stomach because your brain wasn't expecting that. Your inner ear is telling you that they hit the brakes, you know that it's happening, you may even clutch the hand rest and stuff, but it takes a second for your eyes to catch up. That whole process can make you motion sick. CNN: Is there any kind of therapy for motion sickness? Gupta: Being someone who answers that not only as a doctor but a patient, there really isn't. Motion sickness is something that people -- if you're particularly bothered by it -- might resort to a Dramamine patch, or something like that to get rid of the symptoms, but to have it not actually occur in the first place is a pretty difficult thing to do, particularly through training. The Blue Angels, coincidentally, told me the best therapy for me, was to just throw up. Throw up as quickly as possible. And they were absolutely right, because I tried not to, for the first 30 minutes of the ride, and I was miserable. I kept turning the fans on because I was starting to get that cold sweat, and then I threw up and I felt a thousand times better. CNN: Why are antihistamines and antimuscarinic drugs used for motion sickness? Gupta: They're all basically designed to prevent the nausea part of it. For the diaphoresis and the sweating and all that, they're not going to help you that much. You have different receptors -- histamine and muscarinic receptors. Once you have these chemicals released in your body for whatever reason, they trigger those receptors. Histamine will cause you to release acid into your stomach, it will cause your skin to turn red, it feels like an allergic reaction. Muscarinic is sort of a similar thing, it's a different type of receptor but it's similar. But they do the same thing, they sort of quiet your stomach, quiet some of the symptoms associated with motion sickness but they don't really take care of the cause of it in the first place. CNN: So what can people do to alleviate carsickness on road trips -- either for themselves or for people they're riding with? Gupta: I have two kids and we take road trips, and I will tell you that the DVD player can be a double-edged sword. It's great because it keeps them quiet even for just a little bit. My younger one, I know, is prone to motion sickness, and she wants to watch the DVD, but it's the worst thing you can do. It's stationary and everything else around you is moving. [To avoid getting carsick] keep your head up as much as possible. Point out the beautiful scenery outside because it's moving with you, so that's a good thing. Get as much fresh air as much as possible. Try not to eat any particularly spicy foods, especially when you're on road trips. Blander, drier foods, those are going to be good things. Soda water is a really good thing, clear sodas if possible. Heat tends to worsen the symptoms, so if it's too hot to have the windows open and you can afford to have your air conditioning on these days, try and run your air a little bit. And get the kids and elderly people in particular out of the car as much as possible. Get them on terra firma from time to time, that also helps.","Dr. Gupta: Fighter pilots said the ""best therapy for me ... was to just throw up""

"(CNN) -- Backup quarterback Tim Tebow was released by the New England Patriots on Saturday after failing to make the final roster for the new season. Tebow, who was signed to the Patriots in June, made the final 75 earlier in the week but lost out in the final cut. NFL teams had until 6 p.m. ET Saturday to reduce their rosters to a maximum of 53 players before the season kicks off Thursday. The former Heisman Trophy winner has been praised and panned for being outspoken about his Christian faith, including taking a prayerful position at games that has led to an Internet photo craze known as ""Tebowing."" Heisman Trophy 101 . Critics have said the 26-year-old doesn't throw well enough to be an NFL quarterback. In three NFL seasons, Tebow, who was waived by the New York Jets in April, has played 35 games and completed 48% of his passes. The 26-year-old previously played for the Denver Broncos, who drafted Tebow in the first round in 2010. In a series of statements on Twitter, Tebow quoted a Bible verse and thanked the Patriots' president and coaches ""for giving me the opportunity to be a part of such a classy organization. ""I pray for nothing but the best for you all. I will remain in relentless pursuit of continuing my lifelong dream of being an NFL quarterback,"" he wrote.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was admitted to a hospital in Seoul, South Korea, on Saturday with a stomach virus, a doctor told CNN. ""He is getting hydration and holding his food down,"" Dr. John Linton of Yonsei Severance Hospital said. ""All his signs are normal. We hope to send him on his way tomorrow, but he is an elderly gentleman, so we are watching him like a hawk."" The state-run Yonhap news agency reported that Kissinger, 86, arrived in the South Korean capital Wednesday for a security forum and met with President Lee Myung-bak on Friday. A special medical team did a check-up and MRI scan and took X-rays, but found nothing serious, staff sources at the hospital said. Kissinger will likely remain at the hospital overnight and will probably be released Sunday, they said. Kissinger, who now chairs a consulting firm, served in the 1970s under Presidents Nixon and Ford. He shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973 with Le Duc Tho for negotiating a treaty to end the Vietnam War.

"(CNN) -- A missing 12-year-old girl has been found safe after authorities discovered the bodies of the couple she lived with, Arkansas police said. Amber Whitlow was found Saturday night in Memphis, Tennessee, local police said. She was found with her 33-year-old brother, Antonio Whitlow, who is a suspect in her abduction as well as a double homicide, Memphis police spokeswoman Alyssa Moore said. Antonio Whitlow is in custody, Moore said. Amber was taken to a children's hospital as a precaution, and the Tennessee and Arkansas departments of child services were notified. Earlier Saturday, the man and woman whom Amber lived with were found dead inside a home in Little Rock, Arkansas, police said. Authorities received a call from a man who attended the same church as the slain couple and had found the woman just inside the home's doorway, Sgt. Cassandra Davis said. Officers investigated and found that woman and the dead man, who was further inside the residence. Both of the deceased were in their 60s, Davis said. Authorities have not released the names of the couple, nor have they indicated how they died. But Davis said Amber is either the daughter or granddaughter of the deceased couple.

"(CNN) -- An 11-year-old boy has been detained by Bahraini authorities for nearly a month for allegedly participating in an ""illegal gathering"" and for burning tires, an arrest that human rights groups say comes amid the country's continued crackdown on anti-government protesters. Rights groups on Saturday demanded the release of the boy, Ali Hasan, following news that Bahrain's Juvenile Court ordered the youth moved from a jail to a juvenile detention facility. Hasan was arrested on May 14 by Bahraini authorities for allegedly participating in an ""illegal gathering"" with about a dozen others, according to the Bahrain International Affairs Authority, the kingdom's information office. Specifically, the boy was involved with burning tires at a roadblock, the office said. ""The juvenile is receiving social care and tutoring at the center. He completed his last exam of the sixth grade level on Thursday,"" the information office said in a statement, which identified the boy as being 12 years old. But an attorney for Hasan's family disputes the government account, saying the boy was playing with two other children in the street when he was stopped by police. The attorney, Shahzalan Khamees, said that police stopped Hasan and two other boys, who managed to run away. Khamees said Hasan claims the police threatened to shoot him with a pellet gun if he ran. The boy, according to Khamees, was then detained for questioning. A second defense attorney, Mohsin Al-Alawi, said he recently visited Hasan and that the boy told him that he didn't take part in an ""illegal gathering."" The boy sobbed, said he is tired and wants to go home, Al-Alawi said. The Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti-Violence Organization, an Ireland-based rights group, demanded Hasan's immediate release. There are a ""growing number of children detained for investigation in security cases,"" the group said in a statement. Meanwhile, the Bahrain Center for Human Rights expressed concern about the government's targeting of children under the age of 15 in its crackdown. The rights group said Hasan, who they claim is 11, was the youngest detainee in Bahrain's prison system. The government did not immediately respond to the allegation. Bahrain has been heavily criticized by rights groups for its crackdown on anti-government protests that began February 14, 2011, in the country -- spurred by popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. But the protests failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings following a crackdown in February and then again in mid-March by Bahraini authorities -- backed by troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Demonstrators and Bahraini authorities have continued to clash, with the opposition accusing the government of being heavy handed in its crackdown on protests. In November, Bahrain's Independent Commission of Inquiry issued a report highly critical of the crackdown. The commission, set up by the king, concluded that police had used excessive force and torture during last year's crackdown on protests. The report recommended reforms to the country's law and better training of its security forces. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","NEW: He was detained for allegedly participating in an ""illegal gathering"" and for burning tires .

"(CNN) -- Call it the Treaty of Everest 2013. It's a two-paragraph agreement, in both English and Nepalese, signed by climbers and Sherpas who on Saturday engaged in a donnybrook at 23,000 feet. Punches, kicks and even rocks were thrown, according to a statement posted Sunday on the website of one of the climbers, Simone Moro. The Sherpas, locals who guide expeditions up the world's highest mountain, apparently became angered when the climbers from Italy, Switzerland and the United Kingdom did not listen to instructions from the Sherpas, moved above them on the peak and dislodged ice that fell in the direction of the Sherpas. At one point ""the climbers ... were told that if they weren't gone in one hour that they would all be killed,"" the statement said. But by Tuesday, both sides agreed to climb nice and put it in writing. ""Both parties have realized their errors and apologized to each other in front of those present,"" says handwritten note obtained by CNN from the Nepal Mountaineering Association. ""Both parties agreed to help each other in the future to make successful each others goals."" The agreement bears at least 28 signatures, though some appear to have been repeated. No matter the exact number, their resolve against conflict seems certain. ""All those present agreed and committed that such activities by anyone in the mountaineering and in the tourism sector,"" it says. So maybe that will end what one post on Adventure Journal's website described as ""an inauspicious start to the spring climbing season on Mt. Everest."" In another post, a guide said mistakes were probably made on both sides. ""Everest is a mountain where people pour an incredible amount of passion and money into their efforts. This is true for professional and recreational climbers, and for Sherpa who earn most or all of their family's annual income in these two months on the mountain,"" guide Adrian Ballinger wrote. ""The constant pressure to break records, attempt new routes, and be the strongest, whether for personal pride, sponsors, future job offers, or media, can cloud the purity of our climbing here. And these pressures can lead to disagreements, arguments, and hurt feelings. But none of these pressures should be allowed to lead to violence, or to breaking the essential bonds that tie climbers to each other,"" Ballinger added. But one of the climbers involved in the incident who signed the agreement told Britain's Telegraph newspaper that money has changed the Everest experience and spawned resentment among Sherpas. ""They're angry at this financial gap on their mountain,"" Jonathan Griffith said of the Sherpas. ""These commercial trips are based on a lot of luxury and getting you up the mountain and a lot of these Western clients don't even know what the names of their Sherpas are."" And that, he says, makes him wonder if he'll try Everest again, the Telegraph reported. ""I didn't think the main danger would be a mob of Sherpas throwing rocks,"" Griffith is quoted as saying. CNN's Manesh Shrestha and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Fight erupted Saturday between climbers and their guides .

"(CNN) -- The Honduran government has declared a state of emergency after an increase in dengue cases. There are 13,828 cases in the Central American nation, according to data released by emergency officials on Tuesday. And so far this year, 16 people have died from the illness, the government said. Health Minister Salvador Pineda said more than 1,800 of the cases were serious, according to a government statement. Preventing and fighting dengue will cost the country more than $4.2 million, he said. Tuesday's state of emergency declaration is scheduled to last until the end of the year. Dengue fever is passed from person to person by mosquitoes. Unlike malaria, there are no drugs to prevent it. It also is difficult to treat and thus far, attempts to develop a vaccine have been unsuccessful. Currently, the World Health Organization estimates that there are between 50 million and 100 million infections each year. But a recent study led by researchers at the University of Oxford in England estimates the number is far higher, with about 390 million dengue infections around the world each year. Dengue is most common in Asia and India, but more cases have been popping up in the Caribbean and Latin America in recent years. In mild cases, dengue fever causes a high fever, rash and joint and muscle pain. In extreme cases, it can cause death. According to the World Health Organization, about 12,000 people die of dengue fever each year. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Jennifer Bixler, Ana Melgar, Karen Smith and Kevin Wang contributed to this report.","Honduras says dengue cases are on the rise .

"(CNN) -- An Indian reservation in South Dakota voted to repeal a decades-old ban on alcohol, according to preliminary results announced by the Oglala Sioux Tribe Wednesday. The unofficial tally from Tuesday's vote at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation shows that 1,645 members voted in favor of lifting the ban, 1,494 voted against and 438 votes were challenged. ""Challenge votes are being counted and will be released as soon as they are received from the election committee,"" the Oglala Lakota Nation website said. Pine Ridge is the last dry reservation in the state. The debate about allowing alcohol on the reservation divided the community. The ban, in effect for decades, prohibits the possession and consumption of alcohol on the reservation. But the ban wasn't working, Lawrence Eagle Bull, one of nine Oglala tribal council members who agreed to put the issue to a vote, said before the balloting. Eagle Bull compared the situation to the United States' Prohibition era. ""It didn't work then,"" he said. ""It created a criminal element."" Others were firm in their commitment to keep the land dry, saying legalizing alcohol would solve nothing. ""Alcohol is behind every social problem we have,"" said activist and tribe member Olowan Martinez. ""It's our biggest enemy -- legalizing it won't solve the problem."" She cites problems such as domestic abuse, assault, rape and unemployment. She added that drinking is killing the population: ""It's liquid genocide."" What both sides agree on is that alcohol abuse is common on the reservation and beer is easy to get. The neighboring border town of Whiteclay , Nebraska, is home to fewer than 15 residents but supports four beer stores that manage to sell 11,000 cans of beer a day to their predominately Native American customer base. The reservation has a tribal membership of more than 35,000 people, according to the Oglala Lakota Nation website. Many of those who purchase beer in Whiteclay drink it there and return to the reservation drunk. Other times the beer is smuggled into the reservation. If the vote holds up and the ban is lifted, the tribe would be able to establish its own beer stores on the reservation. Eagle Bull says each district would house one store -- operated by the tribe -- with profits going toward alcohol rehabilitation facilities. In the long term, Eagle Bull said, stores on the reservation could eventually shut down the Whiteclay operations.","The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota votes to lift an alcohol ban .

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama came to Washington to end wars. Not to start them. That much was crystal clear only three months ago when Obama gave a keynote speech on May 23 at the National Defense University in Washington in which he called for an end to the ""boundless war on terror"" and ""perpetual wartime footing"" that has existed in the U.S. since 9/11. Obama focused part of this speech on the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that Congress passed days after 9/11 and that gave President George W. Bush the authority to go to war in Afghanistan. Obama looks to Congress to bolster legal case for Syria strike . No one in Congress who voted for this resolution at the time realized that he or she was in effect authorizing in Afghanistan what would become America's longest war. Nor did they realize that they were giving a virtual blank check to the president to wage covert U.S. wars in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen where, according to data compiled by the New America Foundation, thousands have been killed in CIA drone strikes with almost no input from Congress. During his defense speech, Obama vowed to help end the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that set in motion the seemingly endless war the U.S. has been fighting since 2001. This is some of the context of Obama's decision to go to Congress to seek authorization for a military strike on Syria. Obama has wanted to leave office in 2016 as the president who had made it harder, not easier, for future presidents to go to war unilaterally without the input of Congress. In going to Congress for authorization of any military operation in Syria, we see Obama the former constitutional law professor at work, but we also see Obama the pragmatist. Opinion: Obama's Syria dilemma . The Obama administration could have always made the argument in the past few days that it could justify attacking the regime of Bashar al-Assad on humanitarian grounds to prevent further massacres of the Syrian people with chemical weapons despite the fact that there was no international authorization for attacking Syria and no congressional resolution sanctioning such an attack. But that argument would be a novel one as a matter of international law, and it would not be particularly compelling as a matter of domestic politics when the American public seems, at best, split on whether the U.S. should deploy force in Syria. Unilateral U.S. military actions are, of course, generally uncontroversial after an attack on American targets by a foreign power or group. President Bill Clinton didn't seek congressional approval for the cruise missiles he launched at al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan in 1998 after the terrorist group's attacks on two U.S. embassies in Africa. Nor did President George H.W. Bush go to Congress to sign off on his invasion of Panama in 1989, which he authorized because a U.S, Marine had recently been killed there and tens of thousands of other Americans living in the country were purportedly at risk. Opinion: U.S. needs U.N. approval on Syria . Syria hasn't attacked any U.S. targets or citizens, so the argument that an attack on the Assad regime is designed to protect American interests or lives is moot. That leaves the Obama administration with the option of extracting some kind of authorization for an attack from international bodies such as the United Nations, NATO or the Arab League. As is now well-known, there isn't a snowball's chance in hell of getting a U.N. authorization since Russia and China have continuously made clear they would veto such a resolution. There also seems little possibility, for the moment, that NATO will authorize a ""humanitarian"" mission as it did in Kosovo in 1999 to roll back Serbian aggression there. And even if there was such an authorization, right now a major NATO member, the United Kingdom, couldn't participate because the British Parliament voted against such a mission on Thursday. Indeed, NATO said Monday it wants a ""firm international response"" in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria, but that it won't take any military action itself. The Arab League, which signed off on the operation to topple Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, has so far not signaled a readiness to authorize war against Syria. The League said the world community should take action against those responsible for the use of chemical weapons but did not specify if it would endorse military action by the U.S. or other parties. That said, the usually hypercautious Saudis publicly urged war on Sunday. In going to Congress for the Syria authorization, we see not only the former constitutional law professor and pragmatist in Obama, but also the calculated risk taker. On matters of considerable importance where the potential payoff is large, Obama has shown he is willing to take risks. Think no further than his decision two years ago to authorize a Navy SEAL raid to capture or kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, a raid he undertook against the advice of Vice President Joe Biden and then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. If that operation had gone poorly, as a number of Obama's top national security officials believed it could, Obama might now be splitting his time between Chicago and Hawaii. For Obama, a congressional authorization on the use of force in Syria would help him if he needs to authorize additional military actions down the road in Syria. It would also help him if he feels compelled to go to war with Iran. Of course, if he doesn't get such an authorization, he will endure the same kind of humiliation that British Prime Minster David Cameron has just gone through in Parliament. Is it 'High Noon' for Obama on Syria? Obama has, however, no doubt tried to game out how this vote might play out. He probably calculates that for Republican skeptics in Congress, they will have to explain to the American public why it is that they will not sanction military action on Syria after its large-scale use of chemical weapons while they continue to describe Syria's closest ally, Iran, and its nuclear weapons program -- which still has yet to produce any nuclear weapons-- as a grave threat to the world. We can be sure that in the next days, the administration will make the argument that if you let Syria take a pass on its large-scale and repeated use of chemical weapons, you can forget any chance of slowing or ending Iran's nuclear program, something that is a matter of great importance for much of the Republican Party. For those on the left of the Democratic Party in Congress who are generally skeptical of U.S. military actions, Obama can essentially ask, ""If not now, when?"" At what point will self-described liberals intervene to stop the use of weapons so vile that they have been banned by the civilized world for almost a century?","Peter Bergen: Obama's hope had been to end wars in Middle East .
By sending issue to Congress, Obama seeks to make war harder to launch, Bergen says .

"(CNN) -- What do you remember about April 20, 1999? Families visit the graves of the Columbine shooting victims at Chapel Hill Memorial Gardens in 2007. If you recall that two unpopular teenage boys from the Trench Coat Mafia sought revenge against the jocks by shooting up Columbine High School, you're wrong. But you're not alone. Ten years after the massacre in Littleton, Colorado, there's still a collective memory of two Goth-obsessed loners, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who went on a shooting rampage and killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher, injured 23 others and then turned their guns on themselves. Journalist and author Dave Cullen was one of the first to take on what he calls the myths of Columbine. He kept at it for a decade, challenging what the media and law enforcement officials reported. ""Kids had never been attacked in this kind of way until Columbine,"" he recently told CNN. ""I just had to find out what happened to those kids.""  See if you know what really happened at Columbine ¬ª . Cullen's book,""Columbine,"" was released this month -- just in time for today's 10th anniversary of the shooting at the Colorado high school. While tackling popular misconceptions, Cullen also gives a riveting account of what happened that day and how the survivors view the event that marked their lives forever. Cullen concluded that the killers weren't part of the Trench Coat Mafia, that they weren't bullied by other students and that they didn't target popular jocks, African-Americans or any other group. A school shooting wasn't their initial intent, he said. They wanted to bomb their school in an attack they hoped would make them more infamous than Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. The Columbine tragedy left a lasting mark on many Americans, largely because of the media's around-the-clock coverage in the days and weeks following the shooting. Columbine was named the top news story of 1999 with nearly 70 percent of Americans saying they ""followed [Columbine] very closely,"" according to a Pew Research Center study.  Watch parents reflect on children lost at Columbine ¬ª . When media coverage faded, reporters and investigators soon learned that some of the initial reports were wrong. Cullen writes about the misperceptions: ""Facts rush in, the fog lifts, an accurate picture solidifies. The public accepts this, but the final portrait is the farthest from the truth."" Officials at the Jefferson County Sheriff's office agreed that the Trench Coat Mafia, among other myths, were false. Lead investigator Kate Battan said the 10-year anniversary offers a chance to clear up the misconceptions. ""It was the first big event where cell phones were around, and I had witnesses giving information to the media before I even got to it,"" she said. ""A lot of that information was wrong."" For example, many in the media initially reported that 17-year-old Cassie Bernall, a Christian, answered ""yes"" when asked if she believed in God before she was shot to death. She became a poster child for the Evangelical movement after her death. But investigators and student witnesses later told Cullen that it was another student, Valeen Schnurr, who avowed her belief in God as she was shot. Schnurr survived. Cullen's first book reading was in Denver, Colorado, a few weeks ago. He said most of the 150 guests, despite their close proximity to Littleton and the shootings, still believed that Harris and Klebold targeted certain classmates, among many other misperceptions. Today, after carefully combing through the boy's diaries, school assignments and police documents, journalists and investigators agree there is no evidence the killers singled out the jocks in a hit list. In fact, their victims varied in race, popularity, religion and age. Cullen said the myths were so widely reported that they were hard to take back later. ""You would have to go through a lot of corrections,"" Cullen said. ""You would need to have something blockbuster to shake them [the public] up and say 'Everything you know about Columbine, let it go.'"" Psychologists who study memory say people tend to remember first impressions. In the case of Columbine, what the public first saw and heard in the news tended to stick with them. Professor Elizabeth Loftus at the University of California-Irvine, who specializes in memory, said myths continue to be validated when people start talking with others about an event. Once memories are embedded, people resist changing their minds, experts say. ""Memories often fade and get more distorted as time passes,"" Loftus said . Five months after Columbine, Cullen wrote an article published on Salon.com revealing that most members of a group dubbed the Trench Coat Mafia had graduated years earlier. The Trench Coat Mafia was a nonviolent school group of computer gamers established a few years before the shooting, Cullen said. They feuded with the jocks and wore black trench coats. Harris and Klebold were not members, Cullen concluded after talking to students at the school and analyzing police documents. Neither boy appeared in the Trench Coat Mafia's yearbook group photo in 1998. iReport.com: How did Columbine affect you? The two killers were far from normal teens. Harris was a psychopath and Klebold battled depression, according to psychologists cited in the book. Even so, they also weren't the extreme social outcasts and loners depicted in the early days of media coverage. Records released later by the Jefferson County Sheriff's office showed that Harris and Klebold had their own circle of friends. Klebold took a date to the prom, riding with a dozen friends in a limo, just days before the shooting. ""I don't believe bullying caused Columbine,"" Jeff Kass, who covered the story for the Rocky Mountain News, told CNN. ""My key reason for that is they never mentioned it in their diaries."" After a decade of research, including hundreds of interviews and relentless requests for evidence and documents, Kass also released a book this month called ""Columbine: A True Crime Story."" It provides comprehensive profiles of the killers and their motives. Kass was able to get Klebold's college application essay through public records requests. The essay indicated he was a complex teen, who acknowledged hanging with the wrong crowd during his sophomore and junior years. Cullen, the original Columbine debunker, theorizes that the public was afraid to believe Harris and Klebold weren't total outcasts. By identifying them as goth loners who were ""weird"" or ""oddballs,"" it was easier to set them apart from other students and for schools to distinguish future potential shooters, he said. ""The bombs were inconsistent with what we remember,"" Cullen said. ""We dropped the one that was true and kept the myth."" Kirsten Kreiling, president of the Columbine Memorial Foundation, said she believed the initial reports that the killers were in the Trench Coat Mafia and targeted jocks. So did many other people in the community. Ten years later, Kreiling, who has diligently kept up with news reports on Columbine, knows those initial reports were false. She realizes many people still accept the myths and hopes the truth of what happened at Columbine will some day replace the popular misconceptions. ""Understanding what happened can help us try to prevent these things from happening again in the future,"" she said. ""If you don't understand history, you are doomed to repeat it.""","Columbine was named the top news story of 1999, according to the Pew Center .

"(Mental Floss) -- Just hearing the word ""champagne"" conjures up images of sparkling wine, popping corks, and wild celebrations. But mentioning that other Champagne -- as in the northeastern region of France -- evokes a much more complex bouquet. Filled with wars, political clashes, and controversy, the bubbly region and its eponymous drink have produced a rich history worth toasting to. Divine Origins . Today, the region synonymous with sparkling wine is crowded with vineyards -- but that wasn't always the case. In fact, during the 17th century, France's Champagne district was known primarily for its high-quality wool. Then a Benedictine monk named Dom Perignon came along and changed everything. At the age of 29, Perignon was appointed business manager of Champagne's Abbey at Hautvillers. Realizing that the financial health and reputation of the monastery was tied to its vineyards, the Dom set to work resurrecting the beaten-down vines and reconstructing the cellar. In almost no time, the Hautvillers vineyard was up and running. Nowadays, many people credit Dom Perignon with inventing champagne by forcing bubbles into sweet wine. That's a myth, though. In Dom Perignon's day, bubbles were considered a serious wine flaw, and the good monk actually went to considerable lengths to eliminate them during his 47 years as cellar-master. And while he never succeeded on that front, he did succeed in making bubbly wine a whole lot better. For starters, he was the first winemaker in Champagne to use corks, which kept the carbon dioxide from escaping, thus creating the bubbles. He also used a process of gently pressing his grapes, so that it eliminated the dark color that came from the skins -- producing a clearer, less murky wine. He even blended his grapes to make a light white wine, which suited the effervescence far better than the heavy red. Legend has it that upon first tasting his vastly improved beverage, the Dom exclaimed, ""Come quickly, I am tasting the stars!"" Loyal Royals . Dom Perignon brought such nobility and renown to Champagne's sparkling wines that they soon became the preferred libation of royalty -- namely, France's Sun King, Louis XIV. For much of his life, Louis XIV drank champagne almost exclusively -- a habit that made one province very wealthy and another very jealous. Burgundy, to the south, felt the Sun King was giving their fine red wines the shaft. They soon engaged Champagne in a war of words carried out via inflammatory pamphlets and public seminars deriding their wine. The feud was no small affair. In fact, it lasted for more than 130 years, and many times, the two regions seemed to teeter on the brink of a civil war. Of course, the Champenois learned to embrace the long-detested bubbles along the way, and it didn't hurt that doctors began claiming the bubbles cured malaria (a proclamation that caught the attention of everyone with a moat). Louis the Great was hardly the last emperor to take a liking to the region, however. At age 9, Napoleon Bonaparte was sent to study at the Brienne military academy in Champagne, where he developed an early interest in the local brew. In fact, before each of his military campaigns, the self-appointed emperor made a point of passing through Champagne to obtain a supply of bubbly from his good friend Jean-R√©my Mo√´t. After all, Napoleon once claimed of champagne, ""In victory you deserve it, in defeat you need it."" One can only assume that post-Waterloo was a time of need. Sadly, in the ensuing years, Champagne's ties to royalty did more harm than good. In 1870, Bonaparte's nephew, Napoleon III, declared war on Prussia, and by the time Prussian troops overran Alsace and Lorraine, the only thing standing between them and Paris was a patch of land called Champagne. The Franco-Prussian War was one of the bloodiest of the 19th century, and many of the deaths, according to one observer, occurred in fields ""strewn with fragments of glass from champagne bottles."" Within a short time, Prussia had won the war, and France was left nearly bankrupt. It was about that time that Louise Pommery decided to introduce a radical new idea to the world: dry champagne. Brut, as it became known, was more expensive and more difficult to make because it required more fully ripened grapes. But the extra effort paid dividends. The world loved brut, and within three years, France's economy was back on track. Along with the cabaret, the cinema, and the cancan, champagne played a large role in the Belle √âpoque -- the nation's greatest era of peace and prosperity. It's no wonder, then, that the sparkling beverage quickly became a fixed part of France's national character. Trick or Treaty? In order to cement the Champenois' hard-earned contributions to world culture, France forced some specific language into the 1891 Treaty of Madrid. It stated that sparkling wine could only be named champagne if it was produced in Champagne and made with grapes originating there. As happy as this made the Champenois, it also created a confusing problem. Champagne itself didn't have defined borders; thus, when the French government formally declared in 1908 that only those vineyards in the Marne and Aisne districts had the right to call themselves ""Champagne,"" well, it caused quite a ruckus in the neighboring Aube region. (This would be roughly the same thing as Major League Baseball suddenly declaring the Toronto Blue Jays a minor league franchise because it isn't really located in the United States even though they've won the World Series.) What happened next was predictable: protests, riots and 6 million bottles of good champagne destroyed. Of course, the incident was nothing compared to the devastation, confusion, and sheer terror Champagne experienced during World War I. The German toll on the area was horrific. In fact, the destruction of buildings like the Rheims Cathedral (a building that had seen the coronation of many a French monarch, celebrated with many bottles of  -- what else? -- champagne) was so dramatic that among the many stipulations of the post-war Treaty of Versailles was a further, more forceful clarification of the 1891 proclamation that only the Champenois could legally produce a sparkling wine called champagne. That seemingly minor concession in the Treaty of Versailles has become the linchpin of the business in France. The fact that no other nation (nor any other region of France, for that matter) can legally produce champagne gives long-established houses like Mo√´t & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, Taittinger, and Krug a huge advantage when it comes to sales. Sure, other places produce sparkling wine, but in Italy it's called spumante, in Spain it's called cava, and in Alsace, cr√©mant. Interestingly, American sparkling wine producers have been able to get away with printing the word ""champagne"" on their labels, but only because they've sneakily skirted the system. Even though President Woodrow Wilson signed the Treaty of Versailles, the U.S. Senate never ratified it; therefore, American winemakers are technically not subject to the strict standards of the treaty. (Which is why Korbel sells a bottle of ""California Champagne"" for less than $15.) Champenois of the World . Today, the champagne business in Champagne is as strong as ever. In fact, things are going so well that some insiders worry that the only place for the region's industry to go is down. They warn that small producers are introducing new brands too quickly, and that they might be at risk of overcrowding the market. Of course, the biggest problem seems to be growth. Because Champagne has a finite geographical size, it can only hold so many vineyards, and right now, the region is at its capacity. Not to worry. Even though the Champenois make a wine for the best of times, they've had more than their share of the worst of times. And somehow, that special homemade bubbly always seems to carry them through.

"(CNN) -- Amanda Berry's father, overjoyed that his daughter was freed after years in captivity, had a simple message. ""Keep hope. Keep hope,"" Johnny Berry told Knoxville, Tennessee, CNN affiliate WATE. ""Don't give up until you know, because I never gave up, because I know the kid's heart."" When Amanda Berry screamed for help Monday evening through a crack in the front door of the Cleveland house where she was being held, she set in motion an end to roughly a decade of captivity for herself and two other women, Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus and Michelle Knight. Berry's 6-year-old daughter also was freed. Knight remained in the hospital in good condition Wednesday. The three women ""relied on each other for survival,"" a law enforcement source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation told CNN. They interacted during their captivity, though they were typically kept in separate rooms, according to the source. While Berry made a break, the two other women chose not to. They had ""succumbed"" to ""their reality,"" the source said, describing them as brainwashed and fearful. Timeline: From missing to liberated . Here's more information about Berry, DeJesus and Knight and their disappearances: . Amanda Berry . Age: 16 when she was reported missing; now, 27. Missing since: April 21, 2003 . Last seen: walking home from a job at Burger King a few blocks from her home about 7:40 p.m., according to the FBI. It was the eve of her 17th birthday. Clues: She called her sister to tell her she was getting a ride home, CNN affiliate WJW reported. Appearance: The FBI missing person poster described her as 5 feet, 1 inch to 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighing 105 pounds. Law enforcement action: The FBI had 10 postings on its website about her disappearance and offered a reward of up to $25,000 for information about her whereabouts. Her child: Authorities said they could not talk about the 6-year-old girl because of the investigation. A search warrant was executed on the suspect to obtain DNA, officials said Wednesday. Family reaction: Berry went home Wednesday morning. Well-wishers from the neighborhood cheered as a gray van carrying mother and child pulled up. The porch was decorated with balloons and stuffed animals and draped with a red banner that read, ""Welcome home Amanda."" ""We are so happy to have Amanda and her daughter home,"" her sister, Beth Serrano, told reporters. ""I want to thank the public and media for their support and courage over the years."" Amanda Berry declined to speak publicly Wednesday. ""She is a true hero. She was the one who started this,"" said Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba. ""Something must have clicked and she saw an opportunity and she took the opportunity."" Georgina 'Gina' DeJesus . Age: 14 when she was reported missing; now, 23. Missing since: April 2, 2004 . Last seen: at a pay phone around 3 p.m. as she was walking home from school. The girl and a friend had called the friend's mother seeking permission for a sleepover at DeJesus' house, but the answer was no. Appearance: The FBI missing person poster described her as 5 feet, 1 inch to 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighing 135 pounds. Law enforcement action: The FBI, which mentions her in eight documents on its website, was offering an unspecified reward for information leading to her recovery. Family reaction: DeJesus arrived at a family home Wednesday afternoon. A large crowd greeted her arrival with cheers. Her father, Felix DeJesus, said he never doubted his daughter was alive. ""I knew she needed me and I never gave up, I never gave up searching for her."" Sandra Ruiz said her niece is ""ecstatic"" to be back with her family. When she arrived Wednesday afternoon at a family home, ""she was happy, she looked at the house and she wanted a tour."" ""What more can she say -- her face, her expression, her smile, (her) hugging says it all,"" Ruiz said. Wednesday evening, Pastor Angel Arroyo told CNN's Piers Morgan: ""The family is totally overwhelmed, and grateful and happy."" Michelle Knight . Age: 21 when she was reported missing; now 32, according to the Cleveland Police Department. Missing since: August 22, 2002, said Martin Flask, director of public safety for the police; a missing person report was filed the next day. Clues: Knight's grandmother, Deborah Knight, told The Plain Dealer on Monday that the family had concluded that Michelle had left of her own accord because she was angry she had lost custody of her son. That conclusion was supported by police and social workers, she told the newspaper. But the missing woman's mother, Barbara Knight, told the newspaper that her daughter would never have broken all contact voluntarily. Law enforcement action: The FBI website makes no mention of her. Family reaction: News of her discovery came as a shock to brother Freddie Knight, who didn't know she was missing until he saw the story on TV. He said the family thought Knight might be with the brother of a brother-in-law, but had no phone number to contact him. ""I was freaking happy as hell, because I didn't know my sister was kidnapped,"" he said. Barbara Knight told NBC on Wednesday she had not yet spoken to her daughter. ""She's probably angry at the world because she thought she would never be found, but thank God that somebody did,"" she told NBC. She was asked what she would say to Michelle if and when she got to see her. ""I love you and I missed you all this time,"" Barbara Knight said.","Women were aware of each other while held captive .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The winner of the French Open title on Sunday will get a first prize less in U.S. dollars than that of Rafael Nadal's in 2008. Should Roger Federer win the French Open his prize will be less in U.S. dollars than what Rafael Nadal won in 2008 . Although organizers increased the winner's prize at Roland Garros by ‚Ç¨60,000 this year, recession-driven fluctuations in the Euro - U.S. dollar exchange rate means the men's and women's winner's prizes in U.S. currency ($1.48 million) have actually shrunk by almost $100,000 compared to last year. Right across the four Grand Slam events -- the Australian Open, U.S. Open, Wimbledon and French Open -- comparative prize pools have been affected by volatile exchange rates, largely caused by the recession. The value of this year's Wimbledon tournament has also crashed in U.S. currency, while the Australian Open -- last year's poorest Grand Slam -- could soon be the richest across the U.S., British and European currencies. The Australian Open offered the smallest winners' prize check of the four majors in 2008, however, at today's exchange rates, the 2009 prize is currently the richest in the game (although the amount of the 2009 U.S. Open winner's check is yet to be announced). Organizers of the 2009 tournament increased the prize to $2 million Australian dollars -- which is today about U.S.$1.55m. The value of the tournament in pounds has soared from ¬£614,500 to ¬£981,200, and in Euros the winner would today receive 1.11 million --- up from 822,600 at the 2008 tournament. It is not all bad for the value of the weekend's French Open tournament, either, depending on where you take your money. The pound has taken a hammering in the last year, and as a result the French Open winner's prize is now worth ¬£135,000 more in Britain than it was in 2008. Should Switzerland's Roger Federer manage to win the tournament, he may be wise to take the money to Britain and hope the exchange rate improves. Of course, he would still be 60,000 euros better off in Europe, too. Director of the Center for the International Business of Sport (CIBS) at Coventry University, Professor Simon Chadwick, told CNN the impact of exchange rates on sports prizes and wages had been largely underestimated. ""I think there are many subtle influences of the downturn and the exchange rate is one of those."" Chadwick said volatile exchange rates are unlikely to cause players to turn away from tournaments like Wimbledon as it has a huge prize pool and great history, but, for smaller tournaments it is ""a real issue."" ""With prize money you are trying to attract the best players, and if the prize money pots are reduced ... it really does undermine the appeal of those competitions,"" he said.","Relative value of French Open prize is affected by volatile exchange rates .

In the comments people praise Ague's compassion for animals and thank him for his dedication. Despite the sudden Internet fame, Ague is ""keeping a level head,"" said fellow patrolman Scott Firestone. On Sunday, Ague responded to an accident involving at least one vehicle in Palmyra, the department posted on Facebook. Two dogs in the vehicle escaped. One was captured right away but Mya, the German shepherd, began running, Firestone said. Ague, himself a dog owner, gave chase. Mya and Ague continued running for about two miles, Firestone said. When Mya finally came to a stop, Ague realized her paws were injured -- presumably from running across hot asphalt and the rough terrain, the department posted on Facebook. Ague scooped up Mya up and walked her back to her owner's vehicle as a fellow patrolman snapped their photo. Firestone said Mya is at home recovering and doing well. He said Ague is taking advantage of the incident to add momentum to his continuing effort to start a K9 unit within the small police department.

"(CNN) -- Mapping apps on phones have already replaced dedicated navigation devices for many drivers trying to find unfamiliar addresses. Now, Google Maps will notify drivers about more traffic jams as well. Google announced Tuesday that its mobile maps will now include real-time updates about accidents, construction and other potential sources of traffic snarls. The information will come from the 50 million users of Waze, the social-mapping app that Google bought in June for $1.1 billion. Google Maps already had some real-time traffic data from third-party providers and by pinpointing Android users' GPS signals to estimate congestion on highways. But now that data will be bolstered by reports from actual drivers on the roads. Israeli startup Waze has built a vast network of motorists who crowdsource such data as commuter routes and road closures to help each other outsmart traffic jams in more than a dozen countries. Frequent users can even earn badges and real-world prizes. Waze won an award for Best Overall Mobile App award at the 2013 Mobile World Congress. Apple and Facebook were reportedly interested in buying the company before Google snapped it up. Starting Tuesday, Waze users' reports on road conditions will appear on the Google Maps app for Android and iOS in the United States as well as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, France, Germany, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Switzerland and the UK. Users of Waze apps will now benefit from Google services as well. The Android and iOS versions of Waze have been updated with Google Search to help users find local businesses and landmarks. And Waze's crowdsourced Map Editor now includes Google Street View and satellite imagery.","Google Maps' mobile app now includes real-time updates on traffic, accidents .

"(CNN) -- Martha Chumo, a 19-year-old self-taught programmer, was supposed to be in New York right now, honing her coding skills and mastering cutting-edge technologies in the company of fellow software enthusiasts. Instead, she's thousands of miles away, in her hometown of Nairobi, Kenya. A few months ago, Chumo was accepted into the summer intake of Hacker School, a U.S.-based ""retreat for hackers,"" where budding programmers come together for three months to write code, learn new languages and share industry insights. Whereas the programming boot camp was free to attend, Chumo still needed to find a way to cover her trip costs and buy a new laptop. Excited and determined, the young developer turned to online crowdsourcing platform Indiegogo for funds. She set a target of $4,200 and managed to raise nearly $5,800. All she needed then was a visa to travel to the United States. Read this: 10 African startups you need to know . Alas, this was not to be. As an unmarried adult who was not enrolled at university, Chumo was not eligible for a U.S. tourist visa because she couldn't show sufficient ""social ties"" to Kenya to prove that she was planning to return home after attending Hacker School. But the U.S. consulate's refusal only served to slightly alter the plans of this passionate coder. ""I thought if I can't go to the hacker school, let me try to bring the school to me,"" says Chumo. ""(Let me see) what can I do to start a school here."" Read this: Tech hub working on 'next big idea' Within minutes of her second visa request denial, on June 4, Chumo was calling her friends to announce that, ""I'm starting a hacker school in Kenya!' A few days later, she launched another Indiegogo campaign asking people to help her set up her own school for developers in Nairobi. ""I was so frustrated because I had applied to go to Hacker School; I got into it, I raised funds to go there, I had all these plans to read and learn for three months and then I'm not allowed to go -- that's how the idea for the school was born."" Autodidact . It's all a big change for this bright youngster who didn't even own a computer until a year ago, let alone know how to write Python web frameworks and Ruby gems. A top pupil at her school, Chumo was planning to study medicine at the University of Nairobi. But she ""bumped"" into the tech world last summer during an internship that enabled her to access a computer on a daily basis. This triggered a deep desire in her to learn everything about this exciting new world; Chumo quit her internship, took her savings and bought a laptop. Soon after she was rubbing shoulders several hours a day with fellow techies at the iHub -- a co-working space that's become the meeting point for Kenya's coders and aspiring tech entrepreneurs -- using online tools such as Github and Treehouse to become versed in web design and development. Read this: African startup takes on Silicon Valley . Not interested in becoming a doctor anymore, Chumo started working with other programmers on open source software and got a job as a developer. Her passion to become better then led her to apply to Hacker School. ""In programming you're constantly reading and learning and doing something new,"" says Chumo. ""There's always room for improvement in what you're doing,"" she adds. ""You get to do something new and not use the same old technology forever -- that's the fun part, and also being able to build anything that you can think of."" Tech potential . Kenya has experienced a major boom in information and communications technology in recent years, spurred by major investments to use the sector as a driver for economic growth and the roll out of submarine cables bringing high-speed broadband. Although still young, the country's burgeoning tech scene has also been boosted by a surge in the number of innovation centers, such as the iHub, which enable talented coders and young entrepreneurs to collaborate and develop their free-flowing ideas. Read this: Why tech innovators are Africa's future . Chumo says that, similar to Hacker School, Nairobi's dev school will run for three months and be free of charge for participants. Its goal is to equip young programmers from across East Africa with valuable skills and help them build exciting new technology for the continent. ""My vision for it is to have a three months program where developers from Africa can come and learn new technologies and become world-class developers,"" says Chumo, adding that she's already found a space to host the aspiring programmers. ""Not just doing small kinds of technology but getting Africa to get the new Google, the big technologies, these will be things to come from Africa."" So far, Chumo has managed to raise about $12,000 at Indiegogo, out of her $50,000 goal. As determined as ever, she says that even if she doesn't manage to hit the target, she'll continue with her plans to provide learning opportunities to East Africa's tech community. ""For the funds, I am looking into company sponsorship as an alternative,"" she says. ""I am planning to start, now that I have some funds. I know there are many companies and individuals that are willing to run with us,"" adds Chumo. ""In some way, it was a good thing that they didn't let me go [to Hacker School].""","Teenager plans to open a school for programmers in Nairobi, Kenya .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- More than eight out of 10 Americans think Barack Obama will do a good job representing their country to the world, according to a new national poll published as the U.S. president set off on his first overseas trip since taking office. Barack and Michelle Obama wave from Air Force One before their departure for Europe. Obama's itinerary includes Thursday's key G-20 meeting in London, followed by a NATO summit on the French-German border and visits to the Czech Republic and Turkey. Seven in 10 people questioned in the CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey, released Tuesday, believe that leaders of other countries respect Obama -- a figure in sharp contrast to predecessor George W. Bush's poll ratings at the equivalent stage of his presidency. Just 49 percent of Americans believed that foreign leaders respected Bush shortly after he assumed office in 2001. ""Except for the period following the 9/11 attacks, that number never got any better for Bush,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Even among Republicans, a majority believes that other world leaders respect Obama."" Obama's popularity in Europe was highlighted last year during a pre-election visit to Germany, France and the UK when hundreds of thousands turned out to hear the then-presidential candidate speak in Berlin. His election success in November was widely celebrated across the continent. But analysts say Obama is now under pressure to deliver on that popularity -- and will be held to higher standards than previous White House incumbents.  Watch how Obama-mania gripped Europe ¬ª . ""If there is a trade war between America and Europe and, as a result, European jobs are lost, that would make Barack Obama unpopular,"" British political commentator Peter Kellner told CNN. ""Secondly if there was a sign to return the type of arrogance, as Europeans see it, under George W. Bush and other U.S. presidents that would damage his popularity."" The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted March 12-15, with 1,019 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.","Seven in 10 people believe that leaders of other countries respect Obama .

"Roswell, New Mexico (CNN) -- A skydiver's historic free-fall from the stratosphere was called off Tuesday due to wind gusts that ruined the helium balloon set to hoist him to high altitude for the record-breaking attempt. Another attempt is not expected before Thursday due to weather conditions. Felix Baumgartner is aiming to jump from a higher altitude than anyone ever has -- 120,000 feet (about 23 miles), more than three times the cruising altitude of the average airliner -- with nothing but a space suit, helmet and parachute. He also hopes to be the first person to break the sound barrier in such a dive. At that altitude, the thin air provides so little resistance that after just 40 seconds, he is expected to be free-falling faster than 690 miles an hour. Organizers initially delayed the balloon launch Tuesday morning because of gusting winds, then tried to make it happen a few hours later at the Roswell launch site. However, as Baumgartner waited in the capsule to be carried up to high altitude, another wind gust whipped the more than 500-foot-tall white balloon and ruined it for the mission. Art Thompson, the technical project director for the mission, said only one back-up balloon is now available to carry out the attempt. ""There's a lot riding on that, so the main thing for us is making sure the probability is very high,"" Thompson said. Asked how he felt about having to call off the attempt, Thompson replied: ""Deflated. No pun intended."" ""For Felix, it's a lot of frustration,"" Thompson added. ""A lot of anticipation getting to this point, and then feeling that he's going to have to wait -- it's a lot of anxiety on his part, I'm sure."" 'Human helicopter' breaks record for world's longest flight . Years of preparation and untold costs to the primary sponsor, Red Bull, led to Tuesday's scheduled attempt. When the launch occurs, Baumgartner expects to spend two or three hours on the ascent in a capsule hanging from the helium balloon. Then he will climb out of the capsule, jump off the step with a bunny hop and form a crouched ""delta"" position to maximize his speed. He plans to fall 115,000 feet in less than five minutes, then deploy a parachute for the final 5,000 feet to Earth. The attempt has serious risks. He and his team have practiced how he can avoid getting trapped in a dangerous ""horizontal spin."" At temperatures that could hit 70 degrees below zero Fahrenheit or lower, and an atmosphere so thin that his blood would vaporize if he were unprotected, his life will depend on the integrity of his pressure suit. If he loses consciousness during the five-minute plunge, he will survive only if his parachute deploys automatically. Another unknown: the effects on the body of breaking the sound barrier. While reaching such speeds can cause stress on an aircraft, planners for this jump believe there will be little effect on Baumgartner because he will be at an altitude at which there is so little air that shock waves are barely transmitted. ""I'm not nuts,"" Baumgartner said when CNN first interviewed him about the project in 2010. ""You know, our records are meant to be broken, and I'm a very competitive person. I like the challenge."" On a more serious note, he added, ""Of course I'm afraid of dying, because I worked so hard to reach this level. You know, I'm living a good life. I think the most important thing I'm doing is to come back alive."" Baumgartner is an Austrian helicopter pilot and former soldier who has BASE jumped from such landmarks as the Petronas Towers in Malaysia and the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. BASE is an acronym for buildings, antennas, spans and Earth -- the four things from which you can jump. He has been preparing for his latest feat for five years -- both physically and mentally. ""You have to remember all the procedures,"" he said in an interview during testing for the jump. ""You know you're in a really hostile environment. And you cannot think about anything else. You have to be focused. Otherwise, you're gonna die."" The balloon being used is light and translucent. The material is only .0008 of an inch thick, and it will change shape and size as it rises. The pressurized helmet and suit, which restrict Baumgartner's mobility and together weigh 100 pounds, have been equipped with sensors and recorders to measure everything from his speed to his heart rate. Cameras on the ground and on the capsule will transmit live images of his attempt. Baumgartner was not doing interviews leading up to the jump, but his performance coach, Andy Walshe, described him as mentally well-prepared. ""He knows that he's rehearsed it and knows what to do,"" Walshe said Sunday. ""We want him in the right state of mind. We ask him to reflect on what he's done, what he's been through and what he's achieving for himself personally, so he can relax and focus."" The record for such a jump is currently held by Col. Joe Kittinger, who in 1960 jumped from 102,800 feet as part of a U.S. Air Force mission. More than 50 years later, Kittinger is a consultant and mentor for Baumgartner's effort. Kittinger has also been giving Baumgartner advice on what to expect. For example, he described what it feels like to fall through space when there is so little air: ""There's no way you can tell how fast you're going, because there's no visual cues."" Kittinger rejects any suggestion that he is jealous that Baumgartner is poised to beat his record. ""Oh no. I'm delighted,"" he told CNN recently. ""He's advancing science, and he'll do a great job.""","NEW: Another attempt could happen this week, perhaps Thursday .

"(CNN) -- The wooden sculptures lining the median of U.S. 90 are among the top tourist attractions on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Marlin Miller's live oak sculpture in Biloxi's Town Green will be dedicated Saturday. They are also a creative tribute to the live oaks that lined the scenic highway before the saltwater surge of Hurricane Katrina killed them at their very roots. After the storm, the Mississippi Department of Transportation began bulldozing the dead trees, much to the chagrin of area residents. Biloxi Mayor A.J. Holloway, one of the coast's longtime civic leaders, intervened. He contracted to have some of the live oak trunks turned into sculptures. But it would have proved to be a costly venture. Enter Marlin Miller, a wood sculptor from Fort Walton Beach, Florida, who volunteered to create a few live oak sculptures for free -- in part to leave his artistic mark on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, but also as a service to the community. A tree sculpture begins with the transportation department removing all the branches, leaving just the core of the tree. ""I get an idea of what that carving is going to look like, and I go after it with a wide variety of steel chain saws."" Miller said. He works his way down to high speed grinders, sanders and chisels to add the final detail work. ""They're live oaks, so it's like carving stone. Sparks fly off my chain saw blades when I go after one of the trees,"" Miller said. Some of the trees, which are as much a part of south Mississippi's heritage as the antebellum homes scattered along the coastline, are estimated to be as much as 500 or 600 years old. Miller's sculptures along U.S. 90 range from eagles and herons to seahorses and dolphins. He said local governments have never dictated how his carvings should look. In Pass Christian, Miller created what he believes to be the world's largest eagle wood carving, at 25 feet tall. ""That sculpture is dedicated to Col. Lawrence Roberts, one of the original Tuskegee Airmen,"" he said. A recent survey of area tourist attractions by the Harrison County Tourism Commission listed the beaches as the third-most popular attraction and the Beau Rivage Resort and Casino second. Miller's tree sculptures are first. ""We've had a lot of traffic diverting off of Interstate 10, down to U.S. 90 just to see these carvings,"" Miller said. On Saturday, one of Miller's sculptures will be dedicated on the Biloxi Town Green: a 24-foot-tall marlin flying into the sky, three mahi fish jumping to the left, and a sea turtle and a blue crab at the base. It is the only painted tree sculpture of all those lining U.S. 90. Next on Marlin's to-do list: an oak tree in the center of Ocean Springs, Mississippi, and one in Gulfport, Mississippi. He also plans to expand the project to downtown New Orleans and parts of North Carolina. ""Instead of just cutting these trees down,"" Marlin said, ""we're going to put new life into them by adding a sculpture.""","Live oaks lined scenic U.S. 90 before Hurricane Katrina destroyed them .

"(CNN) -- Three years ago, I was just another American working mom when a famous Chinese publisher, CITIC Press, contacted me to write a book for China's single ladies. At first I wasn't sure if I was the right person for the task. Yes, I'm ethnic Chinese, but I'm Chinese-American. How could I write something useful for women in China? But after CITIC pursued me for a year, I agreed. My resulting book, ""Do Not Marry Before Age 30,"" became a best-seller in China and has become embedded in its pop culture and urban consciousness. My life has also changed. I've developed a burning passion for empowering Chinese women, and I now work full-time in China's booming fashion and lifestyle media. All this has given me an intimate look at urban Chinese women, their lives and their dreams. Chinese women want what all women want . Many Chinese women now are well-educated -- in fact, Businessweek reported that U.S. business school enrollment is driven by women from China. Naturally, these women want to put their education to good use in their careers. In their marriages, they also have new dreams. They don't want a traditional Chinese marriage based on responsibility. They want love. Reality dating shows are legion in China, and like the idealistic Charlotte in the American TV show ""Sex and the City,"" Chinese women want to ""dream the impossible dream."" In short, Chinese women today want what all women want -- great careers, true love, and maybe, a child who's happy and successful (most Chinese women are still restricted to having one child under government policy). Sex and power are deeply intertwined in China . The current generation of women is caught in a transitional moment in Chinese history. For thousands of years, Chinese society has been structured around the family unit. Men were the heads of household, women the caregivers. Women lived to please others. Now, there is an epic clash unfolding in Chinese society between women's newfound dreams and traditional notions of a woman's role. The title of my book, ""Do Not Marry Before Age 30,"" is an attack on the fact that women in China face brutal social pressure to marry by age 27 lest they be labeled ""leftover women."" In China, sex and power are deeply intertwined. Concubine culture lives on, whereby mistresses are an acceptable and even expected accoutrement for men in power. Chinese social media regularly features photos of corrupt government officials with their mistresses. Perhaps inevitably in a society where power avails men of women, sexual harassment and domestic violence are rampant. Women's media are the messengers of history . Ancient traditions are codified into a range of laws in China that are unfair to women. But in a culture where women always have been second-class, laws will change only when enough women recognize their own selves and say ""I'm not gonna take it anymore!"" That's where pop media comes in. Naomi Wolf wrote in ""The Beauty Myth"" that American women's magazines were the ""first messengers in history to address the majority of women...to tell them they have a right to define themselves first."" This applies equally to China now. That's why many writers and editors who care about women's culture are fighting to redefine beauty in China, show that strong is beautiful, and profile women who've ignored the rules, defined their own lives, and who as a result are lovely and amazing at every age. Abuse thrives in silence, and the only way to overcome injustice is for us all to start truly connecting with our own selves and with those around us. Women's media prompts the dialogue needed in order for change to happen. We're all making culture now. It's up to each one of us to ensure the culture we create is based on dignity and mutual respect for everyone. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- Patrons at Mat and Naddie's restaurant in New Orleans may start with mouth-watering shrimp and crawfish croquettes. Or if they are feeling a tad more adventurous, they might try the artichoke, sun-dried tomato and roasted garlic cheesecake. Stephen Schwarz has received a grant and low-interest loan from the state to help keep his business going. What diners probably don't know is that in a down economy, it is a constant struggle for restaurant owner Stephen Schwarz to keep Mat and Naddie's up and running. ""I haven't gotten to the point where I have said, 'Oh my God, I'm not going to make payroll this week,' "" Schwarz says. ""I guess I am more conservative. I always want to keep a certain amount of cash in the bank."" Nothing has been easy in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina. Schwarz is one of the lucky ones. His restaurant is in the city's uptown area, near the riverbend, for those familiar with the city's quirky geography. It's one of the few areas of the city that did not flood. He had Mat and Naddie's back up and running and turning out what he calls ""Modern Louisiana"" food just three weeks after the storm. But in the past few years, a city that prides itself on amazing cuisine has seen a healthy spike in its number of restaurants. Before Katrina, there were about 800 restaurants in New Orleans. Now, the number is closer to 1,000. ""I think eventually, there are going to be places that go out of business,"" Schwarz says. ""They're going to have to ... unless we get more people down here, living down here back to the levels before the storm.""  Watch Schwarz describe the culinary competition in New Orleans ¬ª . Tourists, volunteers and emergency workers have been among the patrons frequenting all those restaurants. But the recession is putting the brakes on the number of people with disposable income heading to New Orleans. So entrepreneurs like Schwarz are trying to stay afloat. ""It's a matter of how much stamina we can have, and how long we can last before things turn around,"" he says. ""How long can I continue to be creative about how we do our business so that maybe we can get some infusion of cash somewhere else."" Schwarz also operates Michael's Catering. Before Katrina, it was a relatively small operation that provided a nice little amount of financial padding each month. Things are different now. ""In the last year, it really got to the point where catering is 40 percent of our business,"" Schwarz says. ""It is almost equal to what we do at dinner [at the restaurant]. Before, dinner was about twice the volume of catering."" At a recent charity event on the mezzanine level of a New Orleans hotel, Michael's Catering was among 15 or so entities providing a taste of the city to patrons. It was a way to get some exposure, but the food, which was pulled pork from a roasted pig, had to be mouthwatering. ""It's very important, because it really gets your name out there,"" says Krystan Hosking, catering manager for Michael's. And there was also pressure. ""Word of mouth is very important, because if you get one bad review, there are tons of restaurants that people are just waiting to try,"" she says. ""So if somebody gives you a bad review, they aren't going to give you a second chance."" Schwarz has been creative coming up with the funds to stay in business. This year, he received a $10,000 grant and a $40,000 low-interest loan through the state -- part of Louisiana's recovery effort to keep small businesses up and running. Unlike some areas of the country that have seen the economy collapse in a matter of weeks, Schwarz says New Orleans is coping with a gradual decline. ""It's going to mean that we are going to have to keep on somehow, keep our capital here, so that we can cover this slow eating-away of losses."" Schwarz says. Between the catering gig and the restaurant, Schwarz has about 28 full- and part-time employees. Schwarz himself is a transplant. He came to visit about 30 years ago and never left. He says he's proud that New Orleans residents tend to turn their backs on chain restaurants. But just because Mat and Naddie's has been a presence near the riverbend for a generation is no guarantee it'll be there after the recession. ""Even if we do go out of business,"" Schwarz says, ""or if a lot of places like us go out of business, I hope that the memory of the people who live here, or their memory of what they like, will stay with them -- and those places will come back.""","New Orleans has seen its number of restaurants increase since Hurricane Katrina .

"(CNN) -- It was a love affair begun long before the levees broke. From left, U2's The Edge, Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day and Bono perform at the Superdome in 2006. Before the images of a crowded and toxic Superdome and desperate survivors waving down help from rooftops, entertainers the world over had a special place in their hearts for New Orleans -- the sultry Louisiana city that served as muse to musicians, playwrights and novelists for more than a century before Hurricane Katrina roared into the city four years ago this week. Celebrity response to disasters was nothing new. From George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh in 1971 to Live Aid and USA for Africa in the early '80s, musicians and others have acted in times of need. But something about Katrina -- something about New Orleans -- spurred an unprecedented response from the entertainment world that continues four years later, experts and activists say. ""Anybody, whether they're a performer or not, who has studied or been touched by American music has been touched by New Orleans,"" said Jordan Hirsch, director of the nonprofit aid group Sweet Home New Orleans. ""It's jazz. It's R&B. It's funk. ... For everybody of every generation who's making music in America, there's a touchstone in New Orleans that has affected their work."" In the days after the floods, many of the rich and famous stepped up with perhaps the most obvious response, writing a check. George Clooney donated $1 million to United Way and Oprah Winfrey added another million through her Angel Network and urged her famous friends to follow suit. Director Steven Spielberg gave $750,000 to the Red Cross and another $750,000 to the Bush-Clinton Fund. Hip-hop stars P. Diddy and Jay Z pitched in with big checks, as did actor Nicholas Cage and singers Celine Dion and Hillary Duff. Michael Jackson donated the proceeds of a song, ""From the Bottom of My Heart,"" to relief efforts and actor Jamie Foxx raised $600,000 -- including $200,000 paid for a date with Paris Hilton -- through a celebrity auction. Others took more direct action. John Travolta flew relief supplies into the region on his private plane, Sean Penn took a private boat (albeit a leaky one) into New Orleans to rescue people. Brad Pitt founded the Make It Right Foundation, an organization dedicated to rebuilding the Lower 9th Ward in New Orleans. Almost to a person, the performers who stepped up cited a special love for the city's artistic tradition -- from the Creole brass bands that invented jazz in the city's streets to the colorful Mardi Gras krewes whose elaborate floats and costumes are an emblem of the city's annual pre-Lent bacchanal. U2 guitarist The Edge helped form Music Rising, a group initially dedicated to providing instruments for New Orleans musicians who had lost their own during the floods. The group gave instruments to 2,700 musicians from the Gulf region before shifting its focus to helping churches and schools rebuild their music programs. ""The New Orleans tragedy was a twofold tragedy,"" Edge said in 2006 during the city's JazzFest. ""It was a tragedy because of the fact that this great city was devastated, but it was a tragedy because of the incredible music culture that was also destroyed."" As the city continues to struggle, assistance is still arriving in a way that's different from the aftermath of most disasters, experts said. ""There have been some institutions created as a result of it,"" said James Ferris, director of the University of Southern California's Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy. ""It has sort of garnered ongoing attention, not from the general public as much as from organized philanthropy."" A key difference in the case of Katrina was the 24-hour media coverage the disaster received, at least some of which was spurred by celebrity responses, Ferris said. ""Obviously, that's one of the assets that a celebrity brings to an endeavor,"" Ferris said. ""It gets attention; it gets name recognition."" Celebrity interest in Katrina, like other public causes, didn't come without some criticism. The Katrina response was part of what led Time magazine to dub 2005 the ""Year of Charitainment."" Some accused celebrities at the time of donating or volunteering simply to gain positive publicity or to take a swipe at then-President George Bush and perceptions his administration responded slowly and inadequately to the disaster. There were reports that Penn invited photographers to follow him during his boat rescue, a claim he denied and attributed to a single tabloid newspaper that spread the story. Penn, who had filmed a remake of the film ""All the King's Men"" in New Orleans and other parts of Louisiana, said getting attention wasn't a concern during his mission, which he said rescued 40 people. ""You know, it doesn't really matter,"" he told CNN's Larry King on September 7, 2005. ""The point was that, out of the benefit of celebrity, I could afford to get on an airplane and get down there. And we got a lot of people out of the water. The rest is for people to talk about."" Hirsch, whose Sweet Home New Orleans focuses on helping musicians and members of New Orleans' famous Mardi Gras krewes, said there's value in celebrity support, not just in their ability to raise or donate funds, but to spread the word and keep the story of New Orleans alive. ""They have fans that are listening to them and are interested in their point of view,"" said Hirsch, whose organization has benefited from concerts by acts including the Indigo Girls, My Morning Jacket and former Rage Against the Machine front man Tom Morello. ""When an artist shares their point of view with an audience, that carries weight.""","Even before Katrina, entertainers had a special place in their hearts for New Orleans .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN)  -- An office of the New Orleans Police Department was searched last week in connection with a federal investigation into the shootings of two men on a bridge just after Hurricane Katrina, authorities said. Katrina evacuees cross the Industrial Canal. The FBI is investigating a 2005 shooting at the Danziger Bridge. A search warrant was executed Wednesday at the department's homicide office, according to the FBI. ""The FBI executed a search warrant as it relates to the ongoing civil rights investigation into the Danziger Bridge shootings post-Katrina,"" said a statement from David Welker, special agent in charge of the FBI's New Orleans office. ""The affidavit remains under seal."" The New Orleans Times-Picayune, in a story published Friday, cited unnamed law enforcement sources as saying the agents seized the files and computer hard drives of two officers assigned to investigate police conduct in the bridge shooting -- Sgt. Arthur Kaufman and Sgt. Gerard Dugue. Police Department spokesman Bob Young told the newspaper that federal agents were joined by investigators from the department's Public Integrity Bureau in executing the warrant. The Police Department ""is cooperating with the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI in their continuing investigation into the Danziger Bridge incident,"" Young said in a written statement, the Times-Picayune reported. Young did not immediately return a call from CNN on Monday. The bridge shootings occurred September 4, 2005, days after Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast. Two men were killed and four were wounded as they attempted to evacuate New Orleans by crossing the Danziger Bridge over the Industrial Canal in eastern New Orleans. Seven police officers were initially charged in the case. They were responding to reports that rescue workers had heard gunfire and that an officer had been wounded on the bridge. Police have said officers fired shots only after being shot at, although some evidence contradicts that. Ronald Madison, 40, and James Brissette, 19, were killed. Autopsy results showed that Madison, a mentally ill man with no criminal record, was shot in the back. No weapon was found on or near his body. In August 2008, a judge quashed indictments against Sgts. Kenneth Bowen and Robert Gisevius Jr., Officer Anthony Villavaso II and former Officer Robert Faulcon Jr., who were all facing first-degree murder and attempted murder charges. In addition, he threw out attempted first-degree murder charges against Officers Mike Hunter Jr. and Robert Barrios, and attempted second-degree murder charges against Officer Ignatius Hills. In doing so, now-retired Criminal District Judge Raymond Bigelow noted that Bowen, Hills and Hunter were all forced to testify before the same grand jury that indicted them and the four others. Louisiana law says that information from a person's testimony cannot be used against them in a criminal case, the judge said. ""The state improperly used the testimony of these officers to indict them as well as the others,"" Bigelow said. He cited testimony in which a police lieutenant said he had been shown Bowen's grand jury testimony. In September, however, the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana and the FBI's New Orleans office issued a statement saying they plan to conduct ""an independent and thorough review"" of the Danziger Bridge incident. ""In the best spirit of law enforcement cooperation, and at the request of the victim's families, the New Orleans district attorney has referred the matter to the United States Department of Justice for review,"" Jim Letten, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana, said in the statement. ""... The Civil Rights division, FBI and our U.S. attorney's office will utilize as much time and resources as necessary to determine whether there are any prosecutable violations of federal criminal law in this matter."" Mary Howell, a New Orleans attorney representing Madison's family in a civil rights suit against city officials, said Monday she understands the Justice Department is investigating several incidents involving the Police Department in the days after Katrina, including the bridge shooting. ""It appears that they're serious, and hopefully they will be thorough,"" she said. ""There's a lot that happened during that time that is not known now and frankly may never be known."" She called the federal investigation the ""best shot"" at uncovering the truth. The federal lawsuit is on hold pending the outcome of the criminal investigation, she said. Kaufman was a supervising officer who arrived on the scene shortly after the bridge shootings. He and Dugue collaborated on the Police Department's follow-up report on the incident. Dugue, according to the Times-Picayune, was also assigned to investigate the shooting of a man, possibly by police officers, in New Orleans' West Bank suburb of Algiers in the days after Katrina. The man's charred remains were found in a burned car behind a district police station, the newspaper said. CNN's Drew Griffin contributed to this report.","Agents search New Orleans Police Department in connection with investigation .

"(CNN) -- Feeling sluggish after a few too many eggnogs and a halt to your fitness routine? Rancho La Puerta, in Baja California, Mexico, offers organic cuisine, fitness classes and spa treatments. January can be a bleak month to get rolling on those resolutions, so perhaps  you need a little spa getaway to recover from the holiday revelry and get yourself pointed in the right direction for 2009. CNN asked Mary Bemis, editor-in-chief of Organic Spa magazine, to recommend five places to unwind and detoxify after the busy holiday season. Gurney's Inn, Montauk, New York . This unpretentious spa on the tip of Montauk boasts a stunning waterfront location in the Hamptons, but it's how this spa uses seawater that sets it apart. ""They are one of the only true spas in North America to offer thalassotherapy, which is highly detoxifying,"" Bemis said. Thalassotherapy uses mineral-rich seawater and seaweed to enhance good health. Day visitors to the resort can purchase a pass for $30 to gain access to the Russian steam room, the Finnish rock sauna and indoor heated seawater pool. A full menu of spa treatments is available, including a seaweed wrap or seawater hydrotherapy massage, each for $75. The combined 90-minute Marine Kur therapy, which includes exfoliation, a powerful shower that stimulates nerves, a massage performed while the client is immersed in a tub of 94-degree seawater and a full seaweed body wrap, runs $220. The 110-minute Ultimate Detox treatment uses clay mined in northern France rather than the seaweed in the sequence above for $285. Red Mountain Spa, Ivins, Utah . This destination spa nestled among the red rocks in Ivins, Utah, offers a full lifestyle package. ""If you really want to make a life change and you really want to learn how to not only detoxify, but eat better, exercise, it's a great program,"" Bemis said. While there are some day treatments, only overnight guests can take full advantage of the spa's many programs, including guided hikes and wellness classes. Through February 28, the spa is offering rates starting at $199 per person, per night, which includes accommodation, three meals daily, unlimited fitness classes, guided hikes and other programs. Spa Montage, Laguna Beach, California . This luxurious oceanfront spa offers a beautiful setting, delicious spa cuisine and a range of relaxing and restorative treatments in both indoor and outdoor facilities. ""This is a very high-end, lovely experience,"" Bemis said. The staff will customize treatments to a visitor's particular needs and will show guests how to maximize the benefits of the spa's water circuit. The 60-minute Art of Spa treatment, which uses water at different temperatures to help the body balance itself, is $190. ""You're using heat and water to detoxify yourself. So you're spending, say, 15 minutes in the sauna or the steam room and then you come out and do a cold plunge,"" Bemis said. This cycle is repeated several times for maximum effect. Check into the resort for one or more nights of luxury, or gain access to the spa, spa pool and the lounge areas, stream room and sauna with the purchase of a 60-minute spa treatment. SpaTerre at La Playa Beach and Golf Resort, Naples, Florida  La Playa resort guests can enjoy a range of treatments at the intimate SpaTerre, right on the Gulf of Mexico. The spa offers a menu of Global Rituals, including a volcanic earth clay treatment (80 minutes, $220) that includes a detoxifying volcanic clay body mask, a Balinese foot massage, an aromatic shower and a traditional Balinese massage. Bemis enjoys the option of adding a Japanese soaking tub ritual before or after a massage. Fresh flower petals and aromatherapy essence are added to the soothing soak. Rancho La Puerta, Tecate, Baja California, Mexico  Bemis calls this spa, which is in a sheltered valley an hour's drive from San Diego, ""the great-grandma of all destination spas."" Founded in 1940, Rancho La Puerta welcomes guests from Saturday to Saturday, providing a full week to reset and learn about healthy living. ""It's a beautiful location, they have organic gardens and organic food. It's just set up to really take stock of your life and to change what needs to be changed,"" Bemis said. Doubles start at $2,795 per person for the week, including all meals, guided hikes, fitness classes, evening programs and transportation to and from San Diego International Airport.","Gurney's Inn offers unique mineral-rich seawater treatments .

"(CNN) -- If you've got cabin fever and are looking for a cozy outing, afternoon tea is bound to hit the spot. The afternoon tea service in the Palm Court of New York's Plaza Hotel is an elegant affair. From Seattle, Washington, to Sandwich, Massachusetts, tearooms are serving up savory treats, warm scones and delicious desserts in high style. Sales of specialty teas have quadrupled since 1990, according to the Tea Association of the USA, and these tranquil retreats don't skimp on the headliner. Gourmet tea lists in the United States are becoming more lengthy and sophisticated as American palettes evolve. CNN spoke with Bruce Richardson, owner of Elmwood Inn Fine Teas and tea book publisher Benjamin Press, for five tearoom recommendations: . Dunbar Tea Shop, Sandwich, Massachusetts . Warm up near the fireplace in this cozy wood-paneled tearoom on Cape Cod. ""This has been one of my favorite places for years, and it's very comfortable, very English-style,"" Richardson said. The menu resembles something you might find in England's Lake District, featuring items such as a ploughman's lunch and a smoked Scottish salmon platter. The afternoon tea with assorted finger sandwiches, a fresh-baked scone with strawberry jam and cream and a selection of desserts is served from 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. for $11.95. Teas are priced separately. Palm Court at the Plaza Hotel, New York . Before this historic hotel's recent $400 million renovation, the Palm Court's tea service had become a little dowdy, Richardson said. ""Now it's been completely refurbished and the tea service here is probably one of the freshest in America,"" he said. At $60 per person, it's likely also the most expensive. New furnishings, linens and china as well as an upgraded tea selection have raised the elegant Palm Court to a new level. The tea list features several completely unblended ""single estate"" teas and other premium black, green, oolong and white teas. Warm scones with double Devonshire cream and preserves are accompanied by a beautiful selection of sweets, seasonal fruit and savory dishes such as roasted lamb loin on grilled pita and peekytoe crab salad with avocado and fresh coriander on toasted brioche. The Tea Room, Savannah, Georgia . Inspired by a Glasgow tearoom designed by Scottish architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Elizabeth Ruby set out to capture his spare organic aesthetic at The Tea Room in Savannah, Georgia. The Web site says the restaurant ""creates a gender-friendly atmosphere perfect for today's tea generation."" The room is minimal, but the foods are not, Richardson said. Lunch items include a seafood melange and an heirloom tomato Napolean. Afternoon tea with finger sandwiches, scones, sweets and premium tea is $20. St. James Tearoom, Albuquerque, New Mexico . Mary Alice Higbie and her son, Daniel, run this charming tearoom where guests are tucked into intimate seating areas inspired by English spots such as Stow on the Wold, in the Cotswolds, and Magdalen, for the college in Oxford. ""In the middle of the Southwest, they have created a British storybook setting,"" Richardson said. While very feminine, the business does not discriminate. ""It is fairly man-friendly to the point where a couple of times a year Daniel hosts a cigar tea,"" Richardson said. The event is the only one of its kind he knows of. Saturday afternoon tea, with savories, finger sandwiches, scones and sweets is $28. Queen Mary Tea Room, Seattle, Washington  The Queen Mary Tea Room serves afternoon tea with an added flourish: Guests can request a tiara to wear for the occasion. Florals and lace heighten the dainty atmosphere. ""If you want to feel like a queen, this is the place to go,"" Richardson said. Shepherd's pie, curry beef pasties and smoked salmon quiche are among the items on the lunch menu.  The holiday afternoon tea with fruit sorbet, scones, cookies and other sweets and savory snacks is $28.99 per person.","Specialty tea sales in the U.S. have quadrupled since 1990 .

Jennings Osborne's daughter wanted one thing for Christmas in 1986: to have their whole house covered in lights. Jennings worked to make his youngest daughter's wish come true, and eventually their display grew to more than a million lights. The family even bought the property next door to expand their hobby. Neighbors were displeased with the holiday traffic jams, however, and the Osborne's tradition was in danger of being canceled. The Walt Disney Company heard of the troubles and offered a place for the Osborne's spectacle. Now every year on New York Street at Disney's Hollywood Studios, millions of lights enchant people of all ages. The park even fills the air with ""snow"" to enhance the experience.

"London (CNN) -- A study for Paul Cezanne's master work ""The Card Players,"" missing for decades, has been rediscovered among the paintings of a Texas art collector, and looks set to sell for more than $15 million when it goes under the hammer later this year. The watercolor, one of the preparatory sketches for Cezanne's five painting series, was only known from a black and white photograph, having last been seen in public in 1953, and was presumed lost. But the immaculately preserved work was found earlier this year in the collection of Texas medical expert and art collector Dr. Heinz F. Eichenwald, and will be sold at Christie's in New York on May 1. The auction house predicts a great deal of interest from collectors in the piece, which is expected to fetch between $15 and $20 million. ""For a full-size study from this series to come to light now, when it was feared to have been lost to history by scholars and collectors alike, marks a pivotal moment in the art market,"" said Sharon Kim, international director of Impressionist and Modern Art at Christie's. The figure in the image has been identified by Cezanne scholars as Paulin Paulet, a gardener on the painter's family estate, the Jas de Bouffan, near Aix en Provence in the south of France. Paulet is the only person to appear in all five of the finished ""Card Players"" works, which were the subject of a major exhibition at London's Courtauld Institute and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York last year. The watercolor study was originally bought by Eichenwald's parents, who brought it with them to the United States when the family fled the Nazi occupation of Europe in the 1930s and settled in New York. Eichenwald, who trained as a pediatrician in the U.S. and went on to become a renowned specialist, died last September at the age of 85. He was a keen art collector, and several of his other paintings and sculptures will feature in Christie's New York sales on May 1 and 2. ""The 'Card Player' series is one of the most important of the modern era, influencing so many of the painters who sought to follow in Cezanne's footsteps,"" said Kim. ""[It] offers us a rare glimpse into [his] artistic process, showing us how he worked through the pose and positioning of the characters that would come to populate his greatest masterpieces."" Paul Cezanne (1839-1906) was one of the most influential Post-Impressionist painters; a childhood friend of the novelist Emile Zola and a contemporary of Manet, Monet, Renoir and Degas. His works were a major influence on the development of Cubism: Picasso referred to him as ""the father of us all.""

"London (CNN) -- Depicting, among other things, Christ's procession to the cross, Spanish soldiers presiding over an execution in sixteenth-century Flanders and a mysterious mill perched atop a hollow cliff, Pieter Bruegel the Elder's 1564 painting ""The Way to Calvary"" is a complex, multi-layered work laden with symbolism and drama. Looking at it, according to Polish director Lech Majewski, is rather like watching a movie unfold -- which is why he has brought the painting to life in his new feature film ""The Mill and the Cross."" ""I started as a painter and as a poet and I went to make movies strictly because I believed that the painters I was fascinated would be making movies if they were still alive,"" he told CNN. Based on a book about the painting called ""The Mill and the Cross,"" Majewski's film shows Bruegel (played by Rutger Hauer) discussing the development of his work with patron Nicolaes Jonghelinck (played by Michael York). Faithfully recreated vignettes play out alongside scenes portraying the artist's creative process, while others depict a mysterious miller figure, representing God, presiding over a mill improbably located on top of a sheer, hollow cliff. ""The Mill and the Cross"" premiered in London in March, and has received favorable reviews, notably from ""The New York Times,"" whose critic Daniel M. Gold called the film an ""inspiring, alluring meditation about imagery and storytelling."" Majewksi is drawn to bringing art to life: he wrote the screenplay for 1996 film ""Basquiat,"" about the life of New York artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, and directed 2004 film ""The Garden of Earthly Delights,"" which follows an art historian entering into Hieronymus Bosch's famous triptych. ""For me, Bruegel is time,"" said the director. ""You cannot just come and look once at one of his paintings, you always have to enter the work. ""He has this magnetic pull and once you're in, you become entangled in what the figures are doing and you make up your own stories. You can spend your whole life with it, easily outside of the length of a movie,"" he said. Transporting the painting into such a different medium, however, took patience: The result is a mix of old-fashioned craftsmanship and the latest in digital film-making technology. Costumes were hand-sewn by Polish seamstresses and dyed with tints made from boiled onions, beetroots and apples, as they would have been in Bruegel's day; the ""right"" color black was achieved by burning a candle against a pane of glass, rather than relying on computers to recreate the exact hue; and Majewski himself had to take up Bruegel's brush and complete a partially-visible tree in the top-left corner of the painting to extend the field of vision for the camera to pan across. But some of the more complex scenes, such as the motions of the mill on the rock, required the use of 3D and CGI. ""Many times I felt that we were doing a digital tapestry, thread by thread,"" said Majewski. ""We were extremely lucky in that we were riding the crest of wave in technological advancements because literally every week the guys in the computer department were discovering new plug-ins and new developments in the field and employing it for what I wanted to achieve,"" he said. The film, he explained, was composed of layers, because the Flanders of the painting is a surreal figment of the artist's imagination, comprising seven different perspectives. Obtaining the ""key"" to this aesthetic was hard work, said Majewski, because ""Bruegel is a magician in creating these illusory kinds of funnels in the painting."" He added: ""His landscapes are like funnels that your eye is dipped into and goes to naturally; he knows how to keep your eye employed and moving."" An exhibition of Lech Majewski's work, including his film installation ""Bruegel Suite,"" based on ""The Mill and the Cross"" is currently on view at The Wapping Project in London. ""The Mill and the Cross"" opens in cinemas in Italy on March 30, in Argentina in April, and in Spain in June. The painting which inspired the film, Bruegel's ""Procession to Calvary"" is in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.","Painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder is brought to life in new movie ""The Mill and the Cross""

"(Travel + Leisure) -- You haven't experienced Christmas lights until you've seen nearly four miles of them artfully hung in patterns dictated by Tiffany's head designer in Copenhagen's famed historic amusement park, Tivoli Gardens -- and that's not counting the 1,800 strands dramatically draped on the lakeside willows. Salzburg, Austria's Christkindlmarkt is one of Europe's oldest markets. Copenhagen celebrates Jul (as in ""yuletide"") in high style, with its famed Christmas market the centerpiece. Stalls stocked with fine handmade crafts, including traditional figurines of clog-clad elves in pointy red caps, compete for space with vendors selling iced doughnuts slathered with black currant jam and hefty cups of gl√∏gg, a steaming hot mulled red wine laden with raisins, almonds, cinnamon sticks and cloves -- all of which, for good measure, are steeped in aquavit or schnapps. Christmas in Europe is a time for elaborate pastries straight out of a medieval cookbook, for lyrical midnight masses in Gothic churches and for the upholding of quirky local traditions -- in many countries, Christmas just isn't complete without mischievous pixies, kindly witches (Rome), treacherous demons (Salzburg) or an 8,000-pound fruitcake (Dresden). However else Europeans celebrate the Yuletide season, Christmas still centers around an Advent market that, in most cases, has filled the square before the cathedral each December for hundreds upon hundreds of years. Many markets start on the Friday before Advent, which is four Sundays before Christmas Eve; most end on December 24, especially in Germanic countries, where Christmas Eve is set aside for trimming the tree at home. Others keep celebrating until Epiphany on January 6. Travel+Leisure.com: See Europe's best Christmas markets . These markets are where the romance of the holiday comes alive in grand tradition -- smells of gingerbread and roasting sausages waft through the cold air, handmade ornaments adorn ancient fir trees, master glassblowers and other artisans ply their crafts in wooden stalls, shoppers bustle past Gothic church facades and half-timbered houses, pausing to sip their gl√ºhwein, heavily spiced and mulled ""glow wine"" -- the piping-hot beverage of choice at any self-respecting Teutonic Christmas market. This is what Christmas should be -- a holiday free of mall Muzak and the frantic need to lay your hands on the superstore's last Tickle Me Xbox. It's an old-world Christmas of heartfelt caroling and wooden toys, where every gift is crafted by hand and Santa hasn't outsourced his workshop to China. For a few precious frost-nipped weeks, these museum-piece cities of Olde World Europe flicker back to the Middle Ages -- not the ossified medieval throwbacks of soot-blackened cathedrals and tourist-bedeviled museums, but the living, breathing yesteryear of a bustling outdoor marketplace. A few practical notes: It's wise to book as far in advance as possible in these Christmas hotspots, especially for trips between December 15 and January 1 and definitely for December 24 and 25. That goes not only for your lodging but also for restaurants, many of which close on Christmas Eve and Day; those that are open usually offer a set-price feast and book up fast with locals.

"(Sunset) -- The first thing Laura Slipak says when I drag my stressed self into the chill lobby of the Mod Resort, her Austin Powers-chic hotel in Palm Desert: ""Oh, dear."" The mood is mod and the art is amazing. And you don't even need a car to enjoy it. The second thing she says: ""I think someone needs a Mod-tini."" Yeah, baby. I've just suffered through two-plus hours of Inland Empire gridlock so that I can unwind in the desert, and I plan to ditch my car for the weekend (if not, alas, forever). Which is why I've come to Palm Desert. Not only does it do the whole midcentury modern thing perfectly, but of all California's desert resorts, it's also probably the most pedestrian- and bike-friendly. Sunset.com: Top 10 dream towns . The Mod is just a three-minute walk to the glittery shopping and dining street El Paseo, and a short bike ride away from everything else I'm interested in checking out this weekend. That includes galleries, a recently unveiled collection of California landscape paintings at the Living Desert museum, and the new Eric Johnson Memorial Gardens (named after the ""desert landscape guru of the Coachella Valley,"" who was also a former garden editor for Sunset). Then again, if Laura offers me one more of her mood-altering apple martinis, I might just park myself beside the salt-water pool and spend the rest of the afternoon meditating on the cerulean water. Sculptures, cycles and cactus . Not to worry. After a mind-clearing dip in the pool, it's a sunset walk to downtown Palm Desert to scope out the town's public art, beginning with freshly installed sculptures rising out of the El Paseo median against a backdrop of rust-colored mountains. The air is as dry as chalk, the fading desert light gallery-perfect for pondering a 25-foot-long piece pairing an iridescent hummingbird with a damselfly. In the morning, it's a five-minute stroll to Funseekers to rent a bike. Okay, it would have taken five minutes if I hadn't diverted up the block to take a look at the black-and-white midcentury modern house of William Boyd (better known as Hopalong Cassidy) and then dropped in at the Desert Art Collection & Sculpture Garden, a very cool gallery with a large courtyard set with sculptures amid palm trees, cactus and bougainvillea. At Funseekers, I'm feeling conflicted. Not only does it have all sorts of bikes to rent, but it also offers Segways and mopeds. Still, I've pledged to be fume-free this weekend, so I opt for a hybrid bicycle and power a mile and a half up a bike lane along Portola Avenue to the Living Desert, where I'm just in time for the docent-led tour of paintings of woodlands, seascapes and deserts. My favorite: Granville Redmond's ""Cloudy Day at Monterey,"" from the early 1900s. Later, I ride the length of El Paseo to the Eric Johnson Memorial Gardens, an oasis of curving paths that take you past gurgling waterfalls, cactus-covered sand dunes and a shaded rock-wall canyon. If I could somehow get Laura to deliver one of her Mod-tinis here, I could just chill out all afternoon. No matter. After dropping my bike off, I hoof it to Pacifica Seafood Restaurant, known for its fresh fish and its vodka bar -- 130 kinds from 19 countries -- where vodka martinis are $6 all night long. Perfect. Even better, it's a short walk back to the resort. 48 hours in Palm Desert . Friday: Check into the Mod Resort (from $169), owned by a fashion designer from Malibu. Enjoy a killer margarita on the patio at Armando's Dakota Bar & Grill (average entr√©es $13-$20; 73-260 El Paseo; 760/346-0744). Saturday: Check out the Desert Art Collection & Sculpture Garden (free; 45350 San Luis Rey Ave.). Then rent a bike (from $25 per day) or a moped (from $62 per day) at Funseekers (73-865 State 111; 760/340-3861) and ride down El Paseo, making a stop at Imago Galleries (45-450 State 74; 760/776-9890), which, with its blue-chip artists, is practically the MOMA of the desert. The nearby Palm Desert Visitor Center (72-567 State 111; 760/568-1441) is a good place to pick up bike-trail maps and explore the surrounding Eric Johnson Memorial Gardens (free), a multisensory setting of desert plantings. The Gardens on El Paseo (73-545 El Paseo), an open-air shopping plaza, has a number of excellent dining spots, including Sullivan's Steakhouse (average entr√©es over $31; 760/341-3560), for steaks and jazz, and Pacifica Seafood Restaurant (average entr√©es $21-$30; 760/674-8666), for oysters on the half-shell and cheap martinis. Sunday: At the Living Desert ($13; 47900 Portola Ave.; 760/346-5694), mornings are a good time to catch the young animals -- like Maliki, a giraffe calf born in May -- at their most active.

"DINGLE, Ireland (CNN) -- Fewer tourists and relatively warm temperatures may be reason enough to put Ireland on your list of winter travel destinations, especially Dingle Peninsula, once ranked by National Geographic Traveler as ""the most beautiful place on Earth."" Winter offers tourists a chance to explore Ireland's west coast  unhindered by bothersome crowds. The peninsula, on Ireland's west coast, includes the oceanside town of Dingle, which boasts more than 1,000 full-time residents. Winter visitors will avoid the area's hundreds of thousands of summertime tourists. Boats crowd Dingle's popular marina, bringing fresh seafood catches of the day. Some of the marina vessels also will ferry visitors to see Fungie, a locally famous dolphin who has lived in the waters outside town since 1984.  See breathtaking photos of Dingle ¬ª . Outside Dingle, numerous vacation cottages are available to rent, including homes in the village of Dunquin. In winter, rates are drastically cut, and rental period dates may be more flexible. Most shops and restaurants have shorter hours during winter, and traditional music is found in some of the pubs on the weekends. As with most of Ireland, pubs abound, even in the smallest villages. A beer (preferably Guinness) and some hearty pub grub are a perfect way to cap a day of exploring the wintry sights of the peninsula. Because Ireland sits near the warm waters of the Atlantic Gulf Stream, the Emerald Isle has an average temperature of 46 degrees Fahrenheit (7 Celsius) during December, January and February. But pack smart and bring layers of clothing, including warm sweaters and jackets, because winter weather often means rain on Ireland's western shore.","Dingle, Ireland, called ""most beautiful place on Earth"" by National Geographic .

"(CNN) -- On the heels of news that an almost-900-year-old heart was stolen from a cathedral in Dublin, Ireland, comes a report of a happier nature about a long-lost almost-500-year-old book that now is back in its Dublin home. There is still no sign of the preserved heart of the city's patron saint, St. Laurence O'Toole. It was snatched from the iron cage where it was kept in Christ Church Cathedral at the start of March and has disappeared without trace. But the new and unlikely tale of the book could give hope to those seeking the heart and all things long lost. Again, the drama is set in the Irish capital and there is a church connection. The book, missing for a century, has turned up in ""remarkably good condition"" and has been returned to grateful staff at Archbishop Marsh's Library in Dublin. The hero of the story is an Irish barrister who plucked the tome from a junk shop. The attorney paid the princely sum of √¢‚Äö¬¨90 (about $119), picking up an antique mirror into the bargain. Realizing there was something rather special about the book, he brought it to Marsh's Library, where the librarians recognized it as their own. The book is the middle part of a five-volume set of the complete works of the Greek philosopher and physician Galen. It was published in Basel, Switzerland, in 1538, and had been in the Dublin library's collection since 1701. Jason McElligott, keeper of Marsh's Library, tells the story: . ""About 100 years ago volume three went missing from the shelves."" But last Friday, ""out of the blue, a member of the public who had been browsing in a junk shop in the center of Dublin came in to us and said he had bought something and wondered if it might belong to us."" Library staff members said they were delighted to ""welcome back an old friend."" After conservation work, it's hoped the book can be returned to fill the 100-year-old gap in the shelves this summer.","A book missing from Archbishop Marsh's Library in Dublin for 100 years is back home .

"London (CNN) -- They are two of Europe's premier art destinations, filled with treasures amassed over centuries. Now the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg is presenting a ""mini-museum"" inside the Prado Museum in Madrid, showcasing paintings by Velazquez, Titian and Caravaggio, as well as ancient gold artifacts from Siberia. ""The Hermitage in the Prado"" is the second part of an exhibition exchange -- initiated as part of Spain-Russia Dual Year 2011, dedicated to promoting and strengthening the economic, political, cultural and scientific ties between the two nations -- that saw the Prado exhibiting precious items from its own extensive collection in the State Hermitage Museum in February 2011. ""It was really the finest show that's ever come out of the Prado and it reflected the idea of our museum, as it were, nestling inside theirs,"" said Gabriele Finaldi, Deputy Director of the Prado Museum and curator of the exhibition. Now some 180 items from the Hermitage's world-class collection are nestling inside the many galleries of the Prado, ranging from archaeological pieces all the way to modern masterpieces by Kazimir Malevich. But, Finaldi said, this isn't a typical touring exhibition. ""You've got to remember that the Hermitage has not been visited by many Spaniards and it's still far away and it's still mysterious and exotic and we wanted the public to experience something of the special character of it, which is of course a palace as well as a museum,"" said Finaldi. Special furniture and ornaments typical to the Hermitage, such as granite vases, were brought in to decorate the galleries to make it look more like the Russian museum, whose collection was begun by the Empress Catherine the Great. In a statement to the press in November, Mikhail Piotrovsky, director of the Hermitage, said: ""With this exhibition, we wanted to tell the story of our museum and its collection and the history of the Tsars."" In addition to the objects collected by the voracious Catherine the Great are ornate Scythian gold objects from the collection of earlier Tsar, Peter the Great. ""Never before has there been an exhibition like this, from and about the Hermitage, abroad,"" Piotrovsky continued. Aside from both having world-class collections, Finaldi points out that they have something else in common -- both have their origins as royal collections. ""One can think of Catherine the Great in Russia and Charles the Fourth here in Spain, who collected with a real passion, because they were personally interested but also because they knew it brought glory to the monarchy and to the country,"" said Finaldi. ""They're also the two extremes of Europe, the Hermitage at the very top end and the Prado at the bottom end, so they're the two extremes of Europe coming together, showing things that are on one level very similar and on another level, very different,"" he finished.","State Hermitage Museum displays items from its collection at the Prado Museum in Spain .

"(Real Simple) -- In most ways, Tzatzil Willebeek-LeMair is a superwoman. Four basic rules of organization can help turn a messy home office into a tidy workstation. She has completed more than 50 triathlons and runs a business that teaches hundreds of women a year how to break into running, biking, and swimming. She also finds time to teach Spanish at an elementary school near her home in Austin, Texas, and serves as den leader for the local Cub Scouts, all while looking after three sons: Max, age three; Marco, five; and Jacob, seven. When it came to organizing her home office, however, Willebeek-LeMair, 35, could barely get out of the starting blocks. Her desk was so overloaded that she referred to it as ""the abyss"" and ""the beast."" School reports, unpaid bills, and children's artwork were piled in haphazard layers. And since mess has a way of inviting more mess, Willebeek-LeMair's husband, Marc, and sons felt free to use her desk as a dumping ground for everything from junk mail to homework. As a result, birthday-party invitations resurfaced days too late and car registrations expired without being renewed. ""Anything that comes in the mail is a problem,"" she says. To make matters worse, her office was set up in a former dining room, near the entrance of their home, so her disarray was on display to anyone coming or going. What she likes about the office . The office is open, with high ceilings. It gets afternoon light. From her desk, she can see her kids playing in the family room. What she dislikes about the office . No privacy. It doesn't feel inviting. Not enough surface area for working. Her desk is always covered with piles. The revelation . A year ago, Willebeek-LeMair received an album of special class events from her son Marco's teacher. In photos commemorating ""cowboy day,"" ""pajama day,"" and ""red-clothing day,"" Marco was conspicuously and consistently wearing the wrong outfit, because she had either lost the school notice or found it too late. ""It was proof in print of my lack of organization,"" she says. ""At that point, I decided I had to do better."" Sometimes even a coach can use some coaching. Real Simple volunteered to put Willebeek-LeMair's office in order and set up a clear and simple system to ensure that no school notice goes missing and every race record has its place. Now she can focus on fitness, not on finding missing files. The remedy . Following four basic rules of organization helped turn Willebeek-LeMair's home office into a workstation as fit and flexible as its inhabitant. Separate personal from professional. Willebeek-LeMair's single biggest problem came from not separating her paperwork: It was impossible for her to work on one kind without constantly running across the other. Now that she has her papers cleanly segregated, thanks to extra shelving, filing cabinets, and bins she can decide what she'll work on, rather than being ambushed by an overdue bill or a renewal notice. Clear the desktop. Formerly a catchall, with piles stowed in nooks and crannies, the desk is freed up for its intended purpose: reading and writing. Papers that once covered her desk are still within reach, stowed in her original filing cabinets (bills and other home expenses to the left, invoices and business materials to the right). Supplementary job materials, magazines, mailers, tear sheets are in labeled storage containers on five adjustable shelves installed above the desk. Create a station for incoming and outgoing. A wire-mesh file mounted on the wall to the left of the desk helps her keep track of the flow to and from the office. The upper basket contains bills, bank statements, and other papers that require filing. The lower basket is for items to take the next time she leaves the house. ""Outgoing mail, notes for school, a racing shirt that has to be delivered, anything that's urgent goes in there where I can see it,"" she says. A portable filing box (shown on the floor to the left of the desk) allows her to easily carry files to meetings. Consolidate, consolidate, consolidate. Because she lacked shelves in her home office, Willebeek-LeMair used to store fitness books and magazines in the nearby family room. Since it was a pain to carry them back and forth, more often than not she simply dumped them on her desk. Now that they are within easy reach, she's more inclined to put them back where they belong. The ideas . Corkboards: Three bulletin boards mounted to the left of the desk help keep track of events in the three areas of Willebeek-LeMair's daily life: home (housekeeper's phone number), children (party invitations), and business (race schedules). Closed Storage: Labeled boxes on shelves contain rarely used items, such as the report cards and artwork of her three sons, plus stationery, waivers, and other business paperwork. Open Storage: Frequently accessed supplies, such as copier paper, are kept in open trays. A pink basket contains materials for special projects, such as medals for her son's swim team. Task Lighting: A desk lamp helps her focus on the tasks at hand. Timekeeper: An office clock adds a businesslike touch to remind her that, even at home, there are deadlines and duties that cannot be put off. Seating: She opted for a desk stool called the Swopper ($599, www.swopper.com), which is designed to soothe the tight hamstrings and lower-back problems common among athletes. The update . Organizing is like a New Year's resolution: It's hard to sustain. Shortly after Willebeek-LeMair's home office was overhauled, she says, her husband, Marc, voiced skepticism. It looked good, he told her, but he wondered if she could keep it that way. She did. She used to spend up to an hour clearing her desk before she got to work, so ""I used to have a dread of sitting at my desk,"" she says. ""It's so much more appealing now."" The awkward piling of bills and school notices has been replaced by a clear-cut system: Everything that lands on her desk has a specific place to go. ""When you put things together from different areas of your life, it requires different systems of organization,"" she says, ""and I didn't know how to do that."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- When Spc.Ty Carter first arrived in Afghanistan, he took one look at his surroundings and thought, ""This is a death trap."" He would soon learn just how right he was. Combat Outpost Keating was a sitting target for nearby Taliban insurgents: It sat deep within a valley, surrounded by mountains. The American soldiers stationed there knew it was only a matter of time before something bad happened. ""We just didn't know when,"" Carter said. When it did, the assault would set in motion a chaotic chain of events that had every soldier certain he would not make it out alive. Eight American soldiers died on October 3, 2009. Many of the 45 others who survived, including Carter, struggle with the guilt that they couldn't save more lives. Yet Carter's daring efforts to rescue his fellow soldiers in the face of imminent death earned him the nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, which he will receive on Monday at a White House ceremony. Now Staff Sgt. Ty Carter, 33, will join another survivor of that battle, former Army Staff Sgt. Clint Romesha, who received the award earlier this year. It marks the first time in nearly half a century that two living soldiers from the same battle received the Medal of Honor. To Carter, it's a bittersweet award. ""It just brings back all those memories of what he had to go through,"" explained his wife, Shannon Derby. Discharged from the Marines . Carter was a loner as a teenager. He didn't have a lot of friends. His older brother Seth had a knack for getting into trouble, and Ty followed in his footsteps for awhile before his mother kicked Seth out of the house. Not exactly hero material, he says. Carter joined the Marines in 1998, spending five years in the service until a fight with a roommate led to his demotion. Two months later, he was honorably discharged. So, it was back to civilian life, something that left Carter restless and bored. He bounced across the country from job to job: more than a dozen stints in five years, everything from a yacht repairman to a tow-truck operator. He was supporting his daughter after his first marriage ended. But in every job, something was always missing. ""There was no motivation, there was no purpose,"" Carter said. ""It felt like I was a drone."" He hated the punch-in-punch-out lifestyle of making ends meet, and fondly recalled military life. ""I was thinking 'Well man, back in the service ... I was doing what I enjoyed and I was actually happy to wake up in the morning, happy to go to work,'"" he said. So he enlisted in the Army in 2008. But military life wasn't the idyllic place he remembered. ""We had a platoon full of guys that were on a lighter side of life (who) liked to joke around,"" retired Sgt. 1st Class Jonathan Hill recalled. ""And Carter never really got involved ... he thought it was immature. ""Carter really didn't make friends with a lot of guys, and he struggled with it."" A little over a year after he enlisted, Carter and his platoon were deployed to eastern Afghanistan in May 2009. Despite his aloofness toward his fellow soldiers, Carter would find himself in a situation where he didn't think twice to risk his life for those men whose jokes he once found childish. Defining moment . Combat Outpost Keating had been built in Nuristan province in 2006 as part of the effort by NATO-led forces to build partnerships with local Afghans, and try to stop insurgents from trickling over in nearby Pakistan. The camp had experienced ups and downs since that time and by 2008, the cavalry commanders in charge of the outpost thought it made sense to shut it down. Yet there were other factors at play. Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai was in the middle of his re-election campaign in fall 2009, and abandoning Combat Outpost Keating might have been seen as a lack of American support. So, despite numerous warnings, Gen. Stanley McChrystal -- then commander of all U.S. troops in Afghanistan -- kept the outpost open. After Karzai's victory and the end of a military operation that freed some key assets, the military leadership approved a plan to abandon the outpost and the troops stationed there were to start packing up on October 4, 2009. That never happened. Instead, a day before their planned departure, an assault was unleashed on the outpost that culminated in what has now been described as one of the most intense battles of the entire war in Afghanistan. The first shots rang out just a few minutes before 6 a.m. The rumors that the soldiers had heard for months were coming true. Carter said he had often imagined that day. ""I was like, 'Well, if it's my time to go, how am I going out?' "" he said. The Taliban had studied how the Americans responded to previous attacks, and they knew the outpost relied heavily on its mortars. So they made the big guns their first target. ""When the enemy weren't shooting at us, they were shooting at the weapons,"" Carter said. ""So they were disabling the weapons."" The insurgent fire killed Pfc. Kevin Thomson as he raced to his post. Sgt. Josh Kirk was killed while returning fire. ""You could hear the rounds coming in from every direction,"" said platoon Sgt. Jon Hill. Troops begin running much-needed ammunition to the men on guard duty. Sgt. Michael Scusa was gunned down 10 feet outside one of the outpost's doors. In the midst of the gunfire, Sgt. Christopher Griffin ""immediately ran out the door without hesitation,"" Hill said. ""He didn't make it back"" Ammunition was starting to run out, so Ty Carter and other members of his Black Knight troop volunteered to deliver more -- a hundred yards away across the heaviest of gunfire. Carter didn't think twice about the danger. All he knew was there were three fellow soldiers -- Sgt. Bradley Larson, Spc. Stephan Mace and Sgt. Justin Gallegos -- trapped in a Humvee and they needed more supplies to return fire. ""Carter's kinda like .. for lack of a better word, a robot,"" Hill said. ""You tell him to do something, he's gonna do it and he's gonna do it to the best of his ability."" He would return through that deadly gauntlet three times to get supplies to the men. When the firefight was over, the death toll would include Mace, Gallegos, Sgt. Josh Hardt, and Staff Sgt. Vernon Martin. The names of all eight men who died on that day are engraved on a steel band that Carter wears on his wrist, not that he needs the reminder. Read more about the battle from Jake Tapper's ""The Outpost"" Farm life . Today, Carter still struggles with the memories of the battle, seeking solace with his wife and three children on their farm in Washington state near Joint Base Lewis-McChord, where he is now stationed. In the dark, quiet moments, the constant ringing in his head brings back difficult thoughts. ""That's when the memories start kicking in and you can't sleep because, you know, the whole, 'I shoulda done this, I coulda done that,' "" he said. ""And then you see the faces of the soldiers that died."" Carter said he believes that one more name should be added to the death toll of the battle of Kamesh: Ed Faulkner Jr., who struggled with drug abuse and mental problems after surviving the battle. He left the army with severe PTSD and died in September 2010 after a fatal overdose of methadone and Xanax. While there was no evidence of a suicide, Faulkner's friends -- including Carter -- believe his death was linked to the battle. ""I honestly believe that, yes, he was the ninth victim of Combat Outpost Keating,"" Carter said. ""And I also believe that he won't be the last."" Carter also struggles with PTSD, and now has regular therapy. ""I didn't believe it was real until I experienced it,"" he said of PTSD. ""I thought it was just an excuse to get out of duty ... but once it hit me, and I realized it, I was blown away. How could I be so ignorant?"" Carter wants to be a voice to destigmatize these invisible wounds of war, and he hopes that the attention he receives with the Medal of Honor will show that there is nothing weak in seeking help. ""What we need to do is take the first few steps,"" Carter said. ""We need to realize that yes, this is affecting me, and I need to fix this."" CNN's Eric Marrapodi, Jennifer Rizzo and Andy Segal contributed to this report.","Staff Sgt. Ty Carter survived the 2009 battle at Combat Outpost Keating .
His heroic efforts to save his fellow soldiers earned him the Medal of Honor .
He will receive the award Monday at the White House .

"(Budget Travel) -- It's every city's favorite excuse for a party. Here are ten spectacular ways to ring in 2009. Brilliant and colorful fireworks light up Australia's Sydney Harbour Bridge last New Year's Eve. Bangkok: A fresh tradition . If Times Square's light show doesn't cut it for you, head to the capital of Thailand, where a 52-foot-high Greeting Ball Tower signals the arrival of midnight. Outside of the giant CentralWorld shopping mall, about 500,000 revelers join hands to count down to the New Year. Earlier in the evening, events include seven concert performances by Thai stars. Grab a glass of Chang beer from an outdoor garden for about $1.50. BudgetTravel.com: See slideshow of New Year's hot spots . Details: handsbangkokcountdown.com or tourismthailand.org. Hot tip: Catch traditional Thai dance and folk music on the city's historic parade ground, Sanam Luang. At midnight, fireworks explode over the banks of the Chao Phraya River. Berlin: The best and the wurst . Despite temperatures of around the freezing point, Berliners host an open-air New Year's Eve bash, and the city claims that it is the largest such party in the world. Roughly one million merrymakers pack the nearly mile-and-a-quarter-long stretch between the Victory Column and the Brandenburg Gate. Colorful lasers illuminate the sky while music -- mostly pop and dance -- blares from giant speakers. Elsewhere in town, Germans are as law-abiding on Silvester (New Year's Eve) as always, lighting their private fireworks in designated spaces under police watch. But they also cut loose with practical jokes, such as filling homemade doughnuts with mustard instead of the usual jelly. Details: silvester-berlin.de. Hot tip: If you need a breather, duck into one of the scattered party tents. Rest on free heated benches and munch on specialty sausages, such as bratwurst for around $3. Or else head to Unter den Linden Boulevard, which presents a clearer, less claustrophobic view of the fireworks. Cape Town: Where the Second is best . A slave's only day off in 18th-century South Africa was on January 2, and so it's on Tweede Nuwe Jaar (Second New Year) that Cape Town parties the hardest. Up to 2,800 minstrels paint their faces white and storm the streets for the Cape Town Minstrel Carnival. Expect crowds of more than 80,000. Clad in bright colors, participants carry instruments (such as whistles) and umbrellas while parading from Keizersgracht Street past City Hall and into Rose Street. South African wares and local delicacies are hawked along the route, and troupes compete for titles like Best Dressed. Details: capetownminstrels.co.za and tourismcapetown.co.za. Hot tip: Pop into a caf√© along the cobblestone streets of the Bo Kaap residential neighborhood. Watch from indoors as minstrels perform patterned dances past brightly painted houses. Edinburgh: Scottish night lights . The Scottish capital toasts every New Year with a four-day festival called Hogmanay (pronounced hog-muh-NAY). On the Monday before New Years 2009, a torchlight procession along Princes Street whisks a giant wicker lion to Calton Hill, where it's torched. Then on New Year's Eve, indie rockers like Glasvegas blast away in the streets, while more mainstream rockers like Paolo Nutini perform at the Princes Street Gardens. Nearby, there's a ceilidh, a traditional Scottish party where locals dance gigs and reels to a piper's beat. Details: edinburghshogmanay.org and visitscotland.com. Hot tip: Practice the traditional Scottish song ""Auld Lang Syne"" in advance. Everyone belts it out when the clock strikes 12. Hong Kong: Reaching for the stars . The waterfront promenade Tsim Sha Tsui is a fine vantage point to take in the midnight pyrotechnics above the city's tallest building, 2 IFC. For an even more memorable view, jump aboard the Shining Star Ferry for a two-hour cruise of Victoria Harbour. It departs from the Tsim Sha Tsui pier; price has still not been set but will probably be around $20 per adult. Details: discoverhongkong.com. Hot tip: A carnival in Sha Tin Park will include roving street performances of music and puppetry. It's a 15-minute tram ride from downtown (plus a roughly 7-minute walk). Las Vegas: The glittering Strip . Vegas lives up to its rep as a party town on December 31, with lunatic stunts, a massive light display, and performances by well known entertainers. The Strip hosts the free portion of America's Party, an extravaganza with a fireworks display launching from various spots. On Fremont Street, folks pay $20 a head to see Tribute-Palooza, a set of eight bands that imitate major acts like U2, Kiss, and Elton John. Details: For Fremont Street, see vegasexperience.com. For the Strip, see visitlasvegas.com. Hot tip: The Las Vegas Monorail runs until 3 a.m.; a special one-day pass costs $12. New Orleans: Gumbo and pigskin . As in years past, New Orleans puts its own twist on New York City's ball drop. Its spotlit gumbo pot drops from the Jax Brewery at midnight. Its fall prompts a nightlong bar crawl in the historic French Quarter. This year, is the 75th anniversary of the Sugar Bowl, and the football matchup takes place on January 2. Expect a football theme for most of the weekend's events. For example, in Jackson Square after the gumbo pot drop, a light-and-sound display will synchronize the fight song of each team playing in the Bowl this year with the appearance of each team's colors in the sky. Details: neworleansonline.com. Hot tip: Hop the ferry from Canal Street to Algiers Point (friendsoftheferry.org), where you can get a comparatively peaceful view of fireworks. The free ferry departs every 30 minutes from 6:15 a.m. to 1:15 a.m. on New Year's Eve. Reykjav√≠k: Fantasy and flames . Icelandic law allows a firework free-for-all on New Year's Eve, making for a raucous night in the capital city. Friends and neighbors sing folk songs at roughly half-a-dozen bonfires scattered across Reykjav√≠k. Note that on this holiday, local bars and clubs open a little after midnight. Details: visitreykjavik.is. Hot tip: Temperatures typically dip to about 23 degrees Fahrenheit. The warmest way to enjoy the celebrations is to take a coach tour. Iceland Excursions' Gray Line stops at the largest bonfires for $71 per adult. A midnight toast of sparkling wine is included, of course. Rio de Janeiro: Beach party . The two-and-a-half mile stretch of Copacabana Beach plays host to more than two million partygoers decked out in traditional white. Cariocas (as the locals call themselves) make offerings of red roses and white gladioli to Iemanj√°, the goddess of the waters, before an all-night whirlwind of dancing and live concerts. Head to majestic Sugarloaf Mountain for a somewhat quieter vantage point for taking in the fireworks display. Details: rioconventionbureau.com.br. Hot tip: Looking for passion? Wear a hint of red to send the right message. Sydney: First to cheer . Because of its location, Sydney is among the first major cities to greet the new year. The city will synch up its pyrotechnics with colorful lighting effects on the arches of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Revelers gear up earlier in the day. Waterfront events attract crowds of Sydneysiders in T-shirts and shorts -- plus indigenous people in traditional garb. Between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., aircraft will run hourly flyovers above Sydney Harbour Bridge. After 9 p.m., 55 illuminated ships circuit Sydney Harbour, foreshadowing the barrage of light and sound to come. Details: sydneynewyearseve.com.au ; the site lists dozens of vantage points and other info. Hot tip: Lay down a blanket at North Head at Sydney Harbour National Park, a relatively uncrowded hangout for gazing at the fireworks. Additional reporting by Amy Cassell.

"(Budget Travel) -- When you have beach on the brain, who wants to bother with a layover? Budget Travel has prepared the ultimate insider's guide to seven resort towns south of the border that are just one quick flight away. The Pacific-coast resort of Puerto Vallarta has attracted artists in recent years with its natural beauty and well-preserved colonial architecture. MAZATL√ÅN . As resort towns go, Mazatl√°n is one of Mexico's prettiest, with an assortment of 19th-century neoclassical, republican, and French baroque buildings in pastel colors. The best place for wandering is Old Mazatl√°n, particularly the tree-lined streets around Plazuela Machado, where guitarists and singers roam from one sidewalk caf√© to the next. Eat Sample traditional Sinaloan dishes at Pedro & Lola, a restaurant with seating on the square that's known for its Mexican Molcajete, grilled beef served with cactus and onions (011-52/669-982-2589, restaurantpedroylola.com, beef $14). Drink On nearby Belisario Dom√≠nguez street, locals gather nightly for tequila and Pacifico beers at La Tertulia, a bullfighting-themed bar that's owned and staffed by actual bullfighters and has posters, costumes, and pictures of the sport's greats all over the walls (no phone, tequila from $2). BudgetTravel.com: Find a nonstop route to Mexico . Stay Among the hotel options in the area, the 72-room Best Western Posada Freeman Express has the most character -- it's in a renovated 1940s high-rise and has a rooftop pool with spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean (011-52/669-985-6060, book.bestwestern.com, from $80). Detour To lose the crowds, jump on one of Aqua Sport Center's boats to tiny, uninhabited Deer Island just off the coast. It has a white-sand beach, trails for hiking, and clear waters that are perfect for snorkeling (011-52/669-913-3333, $12). IXTAPA-ZIHUATANEJO . The twin cities of Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo are separated by just three miles, but despite that proximity, they don't have a lot in common. Zihuatanejo, which dates back to precolonial times, is a relaxed fishing town set on an enclosed bay with not a single high-rise hotel. Stay The 30 rooms at the Hotel Brisas del Mar are accented with Mexican tiles and have hammocks on the balconies (011-52/755-554-2142, hotelbrisasdelmar.com, from $102). Ixtapa, in contrast, was built 36 years ago as part of a government effort to spur tourism development on the coast. Today, it has a gleaming strip of beachfront hotels, manicured lawns, and a wide range of restaurants, from local spots to large Mexican chains. Eat El Arbolito serves fresh seafood dishes, such as camaronillas -- shrimp and cheese in a fried tortilla -- and creative cocktails like the Black Banana, a mixture of Kahlua, coconut liqueur, and orange juice (011-52/755-553-3700, entr√©es from $8). Drink At Barcel√≥ Ixtapa Beach Hotel's Sanca Bar, bands play salsa and Cuban music on weekend nights (011-52/755-555-2000, barcelo.com, beer from $3). Do Ixtapa has no shortage of beaches, but if you're in the mood for something more active, rent a bike at Xplora Adventours (011-52/755-553-3584, $3 per half hour) and take a ride through Parque Ecol√≥gico Aztl√°n, a forest teeming with native birds, turtles, and iguanas. BudgetTravel.com: Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo photos . ACAPULCO . Acapulco got its glamorous start in the 1950s and '60s, when celebrities like Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor, and Judy Garland turned the exclusive hotels on the rugged cliffs over the bay into their playground. Drink One of these spots, the 78-year-old Hotel el Mirador, is the place to go for a quintessential Acapulco experience: Watching cliff divers plunge 130 feet into the bay while having a watermelon daiquiri on the patio at the on-site La Perla bar (011-52/744-483-1155, hotelelmiradoracapulco.com.mx, $24 drink minimum). For another side of the city's nightlife, find a dance partner and head to Ninas, a salsa and merengue club where bands play nightly (011-52/744-484-2400, cover $24, with open bar). Stay Close to the city center, One Hotel Acapulco Costera has 126 rooms with simple, Scandinavian-style furniture (800/343-7821, onehotels.com, from $75). Eat The open-air restaurant El Zorrito offers a wide range of regional Guerrero dishes, such as posole, hominy stew with chicken (011-52/744-485-3735, posole $6). Detour Eight miles south of downtown Acapulco is one of the most secluded beaches around: Playa Majahua. Swim in the bay and then try the ceviche at one of the tiny shacks set up near the sand. BudgetTravel.com: Acapulco photos . PUERTO VALLARTA . Puerto Vallarta's art scene doesn't yet rival that of San Miguel de Allende, but it's well on its way: Painters, sculptors, and other artisans have moved to the Pacific-coast resort town in recent years, drawn by the natural beauty of the mountainous coast and the well-preserved colonial architecture in Old Vallarta. Shop The old town has a number of galleries and boutiques, such as Joyer√≠a Yoler, which sells handcrafted silver jewelry (011-52/322-222-8713), and Peyote People, a purveyor of Huichol Indian art (011-52/322-222-2302). See Large bronze sculptures by Mexican artists adorn the city's Malec√≥n, the oceanfront boardwalk lined with dozens of restaurants and shops. Stay One of the best hotel options in the area is the Buenaventura Grand Hotel & Spa, which has more than 200 newly renovated rooms -- some with beamed ceilings -- and a pool overlooking Playa Camarones (011-52/322-226-7000, hotelbuenaventura.com.mx, from $120). Eat Dine on a patio overlooking the beach at nearby El Barracuda, which specializes in seafood dishes like the Dynamite: shrimp, octopus, and tilapia served over rice (011-52/322-222-4034, entr√©es from $13). LOS CABOS . Wedged between granite peaks and the water on the tip of Baja California, Los Cabos has one of Mexico's most dramatic settings. But a less-than-thrilling 20-mile-long tourist corridor connects the towns of San Jos√© del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas, making it all the more appealing to choose a town and stick with it. See In San Jos√© del Cabo's downtown arts district, galleries like Old Town show works by Mexican artists (011-52/624-142-3662, oldtowngallery.net). Stay El Encanto Inn & Suites is decorated in Spanish-colonial style, with chandeliers in the entryway and a fountain in the courtyard -- plus, the 28 rooms all have balconies (011-52/624-142-0388, elencantoinn.com, from $95). Eat Set in a hacienda in Cabo San Lucas, La Fonda serves dishes that chef Christopher Chong's grandmother used to cook, like empanadas with a red chili sauce (011-52/624-143-6926, empanadas $11). Do At Playa M√©dano in Cabo San Lucas, Andromeda Divers y Mas offers water sports such as sea kayaking and parasailing (011-52/624-143-2765, scubadivecabo.com). Detour An hour's drive north of Los Cabos, eclectic shops and galleries have opened in artist-friendly Todos Santos, including the bookstore El Tecolote Libros (011-52/612-145-0295) and Galer√≠a de Todos Santos (011-52/612-145-0500, galeriadetodossantos.com). BudgetTravel.com: Los Cabos photos . CANC√öN . Canc√∫n may never shake its reputation as a rowdy college-party destination, but outside of spring-break season, the city is a surprisingly subdued place. The peninsula is where most of the major resorts are located, so if you're looking for character, it's best to head downtown on the mainland. Stay The boutique hotel Sol y Luna has 11 brightly painted rooms, mosaic-trimmed baths, and balconies overlooking Parque de las Palapas (011-52/998-887-5579, solylunahotel.com, from $48). Eat The park is a popular gathering spot for musicians in the evenings; it's also where you'll find one of the city's best restaurants, Labn√°, which serves Yucatecan dishes such as pibil, achiote-flavored pork wrapped in a banana leaf (011-52/998-892-3056, labna.com, pibil $9). Drink The aptly named Bling Resto Bar, on the resort peninsula, is just what it sounds like; lounge on the patio with a grape mojito and watch the sun go down over the lagoon (011-52/998-840-6014, blingcancun.com, drinks from $5). Detour Xcaret, a sprawling ecological and adventure theme park about 45 minutes south of Canc√∫n, is an ideal spot for families. Activities here range from swimming through caves in an underground river to walking through a butterfly pavilion and watching monkeys, manatees, pumas, and jaguars in their natural environments (011-52/998-883-0470, www.xcaret.com, from $69). BudgetTravel.com: Cancun photos . COZUMEL . Surrounded by vibrantly colored coral reefs, the island of Cozumel, 11 miles off the Yucat√°n coast, has been attracting divers since Jacques Cousteau popularized it in the 1960s. The most central place to be situated for day trips around the island is the town of San Miguel, which has a number of reasonably priced guesthouses. Stay Las Anclas gets high marks not only for its seven bi-level suites and beautiful garden, but also for owners Pedro and Eyal, who are eager to offer up restaurant recommendations (011-52/987-872-5476, lasanclas.com, from $95). Eat A local favorite is La Candela, which serves hearty dishes like chicken stuffed with ham and cheese, and jamaica, a cold tea made from hibiscus flowers (011-52/987-878-4471, chicken $8). Do The tour operator Deep Blue arranges dive trips to some of the hardest-to-reach reefs around the island (011-52/987-872-5653, deepbluecozumel.com, from $68). Or, you can take a boat ride through the mangroves in the Faro Celarain Eco Park for an adventure of a different sort: crocodile spotting (011-52/987-872-1680, cozumelparks.com, $11).

"(CNN) -- A federal judge in Charleston, South Carolina blocked Thursday parts of the state's anti-illegal immigration law approved by the legislature last summer. District Judge Richard Mark Gergel blocked three parts of the law, known both as SB20 and Act 69. The first section blocked makes it a felony to transport or conceal a person ""with intent to further that person's unlawful entry into the United States"" or to help that person avoid apprehension. A second section makes it unlawful for an adult to ""fail to carry"" an alien registration card or receipt. And the final section blocked would have allowed local law enforcement with ""reasonable suspicion"" to detain any person the officers believe is in the United States illegally. South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson focused on the parts of the law that Gergel let stand. ""The United States Supreme Court will ultimately decide this matter in the coming year. Until then, it appears that many important aspects of the South Carolina law will go into effect on 1-1-2012,"" said Wilson. But the American Civil Liberties Union, which had challenged the law, praised the judge's decision. ""We are very pleased that the judge decided to block the most problematic previsions of the law"" said Andre Segura, an ACLU attorney who argued against the bill adding ""this is yet another setback for this anti immigration legislation that we've seen in other states and we've now seen the majority of courts that have weighed in these issues have decided that these laws are unconstitutional and should be blocked while there is a full hearing in the matter."" SB20 was approved by the state legislature and signed by Gov. Nikki Haley on June 27. It includes new requirements for the verification of legal status of new workers. In addition it has the requirement that the legal status of prisoners be checked and mandates the transfer of illegal immigrants to federal authorities after they complete their sentences. Rob Godfrey, Haley's spokesman said, ""If the feds were doing their job, we wouldn't have had to address illegal immigration reform at the state level. But, until they do, we're going to keep fighting in South Carolina to be able to enforce our laws. Governor Haley is hopeful that the U.S. Supreme Court will soon do what Congress and the executive branch have failed to do, which is allow the states to pick up the slack where Washington has failed."" CNN's Gustavo Valdes and Bill Mears contributed to this report .","Judge blocks parts of South Carolina's immigration law .

"London (CNN) -- With its palaces, sculpted parks, concert halls and museums, Vienna is a city steeped in culture. Once home to composers including Beethoven, Mozart, and Johann Strauss, and to artists Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele, as well as the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, Vienna has been at the forefront of major cultural movements for centuries. But that doesn't mean it's stuck in the past; Vienna has a youthful side, too, and is visited yearly by backpackers as much as mainline culture aficionados -- something Richard Linklater celebrated in his 1995 film ""Before Sunrise,"" which charted two strangers falling in love in the course of one day, with Vienna as the romantic backdrop. Whether you visit in the winter for Christmas markets glittering under snowflakes, or in the spring when the flowers in the city's many parks are in bloom, the city is sure to charm. CNN World's Treasures selects some of the best spots to experience ""Old World"" Vienna, from galleries and parks to historic landmarks. SEE . 2012 marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Austrian painter Gustav Klimt, one of the founding members of the Vienna Secession, an avant-garde artistic group at the turn of the century. Indeed, one of the city's architectural masterpieces, the art nouveau Secession building, was commissioned by the group at as a haven for the latest in contemporary art. The Museum features Klimt's Beethoven mural, but to see his famed golden-hued painting ""The Kiss,"" head to the Belvedere Museum, housed in a magnificent palace built in the 1700s. It boasts a comprehensive collection of Klimt paintings, alongside works by Kokoschka, Schiele, Vincent van Gogh and Auguste Rodin among others. Vienna's turn-of-the-century painters owed much to the new theories about the mind coming from Sigmund Freud, and no trip to Vienna would be complete without visiting the Sigmund Freud Museum, where the founder of psychoanalysis lived until he was forced to flee in 1938. Take in a lecture or simply wander around the original waiting room and imagine you are about to be examined by the great man himself. For those looking to feast their eyes on earlier examples of the city's opulent past, look no further than the Schatzkammer, the imperial treasury and home to the Hapsburg Crown Jewels, which is located in the vast Hofburg Palace, seat of the ruling Hapsburg dynasty. HEAR . For lovers of classical music, Vienna is a must-visit, as it was in the eighteenth century, when it attracted the young Mozart. You can visit the apartment Mozart lived in when he composed ""The Marriage of Figaro"" among other great works, which has been turned into a museum and boasts temporary exhibitions, in addition to the permanent collection of objects in the house itself. You can even hear his music wafting through the rooms as you wander around. For concerts, head to the Musikverein for performances by the Wiener Philharmoniker and smaller chamber concerts. Or for operas, book a seat at the grand Staatsoper, or the Theater-an-der-Wien, where works by Beethoven and Strauss originally premiered. STROLL . Vienna has a wealth of open spaces and parks, from the sculpted alpine gardens at the Belvedere Castle to the more laid-back, youthful feel of Danube Island. Rathauspark boasts an ice-skating rink in winter and an open-air cinema in summer. Alternatively, take a walk around the Baroque gardens at the Schonbrunn Palace. A well-worn tourist activity is to ride the Ferris wheel at the Prater Amusement Park, which features in the Graham Greene-penned noir film ""The Third Man."" STAY . Places to stay in Vienna are plentiful and cater to all budgets. The Hotel Altstadt is located in the arty Spittelberg district, just behind the MuseumsQuartier and features an impressive contemporary art and design collection; Das Tyrol, a cozy former monastery with a small spa, features art works by young Viennese artists; the Konig von Ungarn has the benefit of being in the same complex of 300-year-old buildings as Mozart's one-time living quarters; and the Hilton Vienna Danube has views over the river. EAT . Viennese cuisine is not for those watching their waistlines; mouth-watering pastries and cakes, breaded meats and beer and wine a-plenty make the city a feast for the taste-buds. Steirereck serves an impressive, if also not exactly slimming array of delicious Viennese dishes, while Demel serves coffee and cakes for an afternoon treat in-between sightseeing.","Vienna is a city steeped in culture; CNN World's Treasures selects the top cultural destinations for visitors .

"(CNN) -- ""A floating toilet, a floating Petri dish, a floating hell."" That was how a Texas woman described the Triumph in a lawsuit filed Friday against Carnival Cruise Lines. In the nine-page complaint, Cassie Terry, of Lake Jackson, south of Houston, seeks unspecified damages for what she says she endured on a vacation cruise aboard the Triumph to Mexico. The cruise departed Galveston on February 7. Three days later, when the ship was 150 miles off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, ""an engine room fire knocked out its primary power source, crippling its water and plumbing systems and leaving it adrift,"" the complaint says. Tears and big hugs as passengers reunite with families . For the following nearly five days, Terry, 25, ""was forced to endure deplorable, unsafe and unsanitary conditions, including but not limited to, sweltering temperatures, lack of power and air conditioning, lack of hot or running water, and lack of working toilets,"" it says. During the tow back to the United States, ""the vessel listed sharply several times, causing human waste to spill out of non-functioning toilets, flood across the Vessel's floors and halls, and drip down the Vessel's walls,"" it says. ""Plaintiff was forced to endure unbearable and horrendous odors on the filthy and disabled Vessel, and wade through human feces in order to reach food lines where the wait was counted in hours, only to receive rations of spoiled food. Plaintiff was forced to subsist for days in a floating toilet, a floating Petri dish, a floating hell."" According to the complaint, ""Defendant knew the vessel was not seaworthy, either at the time it contracted with Plaintiff, or at the point of departure, but did not advise Plainttiff the Vessel had and was experiencing problems with its propulsion and/or engine room fire suppression equipment.""

"(CNN) -- With its heaving highways, glittering skyscrapers, contemporary art and design spaces, and countless new developments, Beijing is a thoroughly modern city. But beyond its contemporary facade are the remnants of hundreds of years of traditional history. Home to numerous ruling dynasties, Beijing is famed for its Forbidden City, a majestic court surrounded by high walls, once all but impossible to enter, which can now be visited by locals and tourists alike. Palaces temples and observatories dot the city, usually set in parks providing respite from the hustle and bustle. CNN's World's Treasures offers its top five picks of Beijing's traditional sites, from palaces laden with jaw-dropping artifacts to tranquil sculpted gardens that will -- almost -- make you forget you're in a buzzing modern metropolis. The Forbidden City . Built in the early 15th century, this gilded fortress was the seat of power during the Ming and Qing dynasties. With its breathtaking art and furniture and its sheer scale, the Forbidden City is a must on any Beijing travel itinerary. Visitors can easily lose themselves for hours admiring its opulence, sheltered from the outside world by high walls. Secret Garden of Beijing's Forbidden City garden revealed . The Summer Palace . Set in a landscaped park, the imperial court's summer residence is now a beautiful resting spot for the city-weary. Pavilions, temples and palaces make up the stunning vista, but perhaps the most memorable feature is a marble boat commissioned by the Empress Dowager Cixi. It also boasts the 900-meter Long Gallery -- home to paintings of mythological scenes -- and a lake on which you can row boats in summer and ice skate in winter. The Temple of Heaven . The Temple of Heaven, located in Beijing's Tiantan Park, was built in the 15th century during the Ming period and is admired for its complex architecture that symbolizes the meeting between heaven and earth, with the Emperor believed to have been the link between the two. The Temple was where sacrifices were offered to heaven and earth, and these were carried out for nearly 500 years before being banned at the beginning of the 20th century. Ancient Observatory . The history of this observatory stretches all the way back to the days of Khubilai Khan, grandson of the feared Mongolian warlord Genghis. It is set in a tranquil park, features eight Ming dynasty astronomical instruments on its roof, and is attached to a small museum. Khubilai Khan's riches travel to New York . Confucian Temple . Completed in 1306, during the Yuan dynasty, the Confucian Temple was both a place of learning and where emperors offered sacrifices to the philosopher Confucius up until the beginning of the 20th century. Carvings, commemorative stone tablets and numerous statues of wise men make this a quiet pit-stop, perfect for a spot of contemplation.","Beijing may be a bustling modern metropolis but it is steeped in hundreds of years of history .

"(CNN) -- In the world of cyber security there are some well-known designations for anyone that considers him or herself to be a hacker, the term being so broad in scope now. One can be a ""white-hat"" hacker or a ""black hat,"" the former being someone who uses their programming prowess to protect digital data, and the latter someone who seeks to subvert and steal it for their own malicious reasons. Fall into the middle and you're a ""grey hat."" The recent revelations about the NSA in the United States have made these labels much fuzzier, since government and NSA hackers should be white hat. Yet a recent report in the Washington Post, citing top-secret documents and an internal audit, showed the NSA had broken privacy rules thousands of times as it conducted its widespread surveillance. Of course, navigating the ethics of data privacy is a complicated business since there's just so much of it -- 90% of the world's data has been generated in the last two years, according to IBM. A very likely consequence of the NSA revelations from former cyber security contractor Edward Snowden, is that people will increasingly not care who the hacker trawling through their data is -- whether it's an ethically-conflicted government contractor like Snowden, or someone more unscrupulous trying to sell their digital address book to spammers. They just want their data to be un-hackable. Read more: SIM card hack inspires quick fix by carriers . Over the years, we've read about how easy it appears to be to hack a website, server, or a device if you just have the know-how and the inclination. The subversive digital community Anonymous showed this in 2011, when clusters of young people within its network were able to temporarily paralyze websites of major corporations and steal data, often without the background of real programming knowledge. In more than one case these volunteers used a free program they downloaded from the Web, which automated a data theft for them. For those in the cyber security industry, such big attacks were an ""I told you so"" moment, proving how insecure our personal data was when it was stored in online databases by even large companies and institutions. Read more: Hacker says phone app could hijack plane . The question of how we can find a good privacy balance in a networked world leads us to the paradox of mobile devices, the next battleground for data and privacy. Smartphones are essentially mini computers and as a result can offer both our best hope for private digital communication, and greater vulnerability. First the hope. It's been made clear in the last few months that email is no longer considered a safe and secure way to send information to someone. The founder of secure email service Lavabit, who counted Ed Snowden as a user, recently suspended his business in the face of a government investigation. The vendors of another secure email service, called Silent Circle, shut down their email service soon after, and cited fundamental security flaws inherent in email. Phil Zimmermann, the co-founder of Silent Circle and inventor of a popular encryption standard for email called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) even said at the time that email was just not secure anymore. In one way, thanks to using standard Internet protocols, it never has been. Now instead of using email, Zimmermann increasingly uses mobile messaging services of the kind offered by his company. The general public can take a leaf out of Zimmermann's book. Mobile messaging apps like WhatsApp and Wickr look better mainstream options for secure digital communication. Researchers: We can hack an iPhone through the charger . WhatsApp avoids advertisers like the plague and relies on subscription payments, while Wickr encrypts messages and deletes them after a set amount of time -- like a burning candle wick. On the other hand, mobile phones are just another attack vector for grey and black hat hackers, with potentially richer information than what's obtainable from a desktop computer: location data, access to your contacts address book, photos and real time audio through your microphone. Smartphones are particularly vulnerable in emerging markets like China, where more people use Android phones than in the U.S. and Western Europe, and download apps from third party sites because Google Play is banned by Beijing. The problem here is that it's becoming easier to inject malware into fake apps, for unsuspecting Android users to download. In the last few months, security researchers have found a remote access tool in the wild called AndroRAT, which coupled with a new software tool called a binder, makes it surprisingly easy to inject malicious code into a fake version of a popular, paid-for app or game, package it together and upload it to a third-party site at a discounted rate or for free. Once the app has been downloaded, the hacker can remotely steal the victim's contacts data, turn on their camera or turn on their mic and record conversations. Researchers say the tool is most attractive to spammers who want to steal contact data and premium text messages. Read more: Are you in danger of 'drive-by' hacking? What's disturbing is that using the tool does not require a sophisticated level of programming knowledge, echoing the desktop tools that were used by supporters of Anonymous to attack online databases. Far more tame, but still disturbing for many privacy advocates, is the amount of data that mobile app developers are able to funnel out to advertising networks after you've downloaded one of their free apps -- and this applies to anyone that uses an iPhone or Android phone in the developed world. History repeats itself. So long as we continue to rely on small, rectangular slabs for computers and carry them everywhere, pumping them with all manner of personal and professional information, they'll increasingly become a target for hackers white, grey or black. If people value their privacy, they'll vote with their wallets and invest in services that encrypt their data and keep their communications private -- and a few they might ditch their phones altogether. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Parmy Olson.","Mobile devices are the next battleground for data and privacy, Parmy Olson writes .

"(CNN) -- A Colorado judge on Monday ordered that some key records remain sealed and others be released in the case against James Holmes in last month's deadly rampage at an Aurora movie theater. Arapahoe County District Chief Judge William Sylvester issued his order in response to requests by members of the media, including CNN, asking that a host of records be made public. The 24-year-old former graduate student is accused of opening fire during a midnight premiere of the latest Batman movie, leaving 12 dead and injuring 58 others. The prosecution and defense had argued for the documents to remain sealed -- the former to assure the integrity of the continuing investigation, and the latter to protect Holmes' right to a fair trial. Holmes has been charged with murder and attempted murder, and faces two weapons charges. Colorado shooting suspect's writings offer insight as student, aspiring scientist . ""While the court is cognizant of the important role media petitioners play in informing the public's legitimate interest in knowing the actions taken by government officials responsible for the investigation, prosecution and trial of (the) defendant, the court also will not jeopardize the integrity of the process and the truth-seeking functions of our justice system by authorizing the premature release of records,"" Sylvester wrote. The judge reaffirmed his earlier decision barring the University of Colorado from releasing records related to Holmes, who had been a Ph.D. candidate studying neuroscience at the school. He withdrew from the program in June, weeks before the shooting. Sylvester furthermore cited the Colorado Criminal Justice Records Act, which states that ""records of official actions ... shall be open for inspection,"" while other records from criminal justice agencies may be released or kept under seal. Reasoning that they aren't ""records of official actions (that) must be disclosed,"" the judge ordered that probable cause affidavits, subpoenas, arrest warrants and search warrants be suppressed at this time, in the early stages of the investigation. The case's ""register of actions,"" or docket -- identifying court appearances and filings by the parties involved in the case, including motions and orders -- was ordered released. Sylvester decided that ""unrestricted access (to the register) would not pose a substantial probability of harm to the fairness of the trial."" Media urge unsealing of documents in Colorado shooting case . The judge also sided with the media petitioners in ordering the release of 34 motions and orders that have been filed and court orders issued so far in the case. They include documents pertaining to arguments about limiting pretrial publicity, allowing access and preserving the crime scene. Steven Zansberg, a lawyer representing the media coalition, applauded part of Monday's decision and expressed disappointment over others. ""We are pleased that Judge Sylvester has unsealed 34 documents in the court file that were previously not available to the public, and thereby has brought much needed transparency to this judicial proceeding,"" Zansberg said via email. ""We are disappointed that the affidavits of probable cause remain under seal at this time, but are hopeful that the court will revisit that issue some time in the not too distant future."" The Arapahoe County judge also issued an order Monday clarifying and essentially upholding a previously issued limited gag order preventing defense lawyers, prosecutors and law enforcement agencies from disclosing certain information to the media.

"Beijing (CNN) -- A rash of violent protests in China continued over the weekend as migrant workers and security forces clashed in a rural city about 60 miles northwest of Hong Kong, local government officials and witnesses said. The protest erupted in Zengcheng over what witnesses described as rough handling of a pregnant street vendor by security guards Friday. Local government officials said the protests involved hundreds, while other unofficial reports estimated tens of thousands of protesters. The demonstrators hurled bottles and bricks at government officials and marched to the local police station, where they damaged several cars, according to the local government officials. Protests continued Saturday and Sunday, according to local officials. The situation in Zengcheng remains tense, according to a businessman who asked to be identified only by his surname, Hu, because he was concerned about reprisals from government officials. Looting and violence is widespread at night, despite the presence of security forces, according to Hu, who said he witnessed nighttime violence before deciding it would be safer to stay inside at night. The Zengcheng riot is the latest disturbance in China, whose government is apparently unnerved by scenes of masses of protesters across the Middle East and North Africa seeking, and in some cases winning, reform from their governments. ""Because of the Arab Spring and economic insecurities people face in China, the government has been cracking down even harder on protests, even if they are of a local nature,"" said Patrick Chovanec, a political analyst at Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management in Beijing. Last week in Lichuan, protests broke out after the prison death of a local government official who had been charged with bribery. The local government said the death of Ran Jianxin was still under investigation. They said that two local officials had been suspended and were under investigation in his death. Two others involved in the corruption case against Ran were in custody, according to the local government. Residents said they believed Ran was killed for not cooperating with other corrupt officials. A YouTube video showed people gathered in front of government buildings with a banner reading, ""(Ran) offended the officials for the benefit of the people, and he was murdered."" Large protests also continued last week in Inner Mongolia, when thousands of ethic Mongolians swarmed security officers after the death of a Mongolian who had been hit by a coal truck driven by an ethnic Han Chinese. In late May, thousands of Mongolian students protested in support of the herder in Xilin Gol. And Chinese authorities arrested dozens of demonstrators in Hohhot last month as protests spread to the provincial capital and other cities in Inner Mongolia despite tightened security and reports of martial law, activists said. On Monday, military veterans openly demonstrated at Beijing's railroad ministry, claiming they were denied jobs they had been promised. Ministry officials could not be reached for comment Monday. CNN's Eunice Yoon, Steven Jiang and Helena Hong contributed to this report.","Migrant workers and security forces clash over the weekend in southern China .

"(CNN) -- An international team tasked with overseeing the effort to rid Syria of its chemical weapons has arrived in Damascus. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said Tuesday that the inspectors are focusing on the initial planning phase of helping the embattled country destroy its chemical weapons production facilities. They plan to visit nearly 50 sites as part of the mission. Some are not convinced the plan will work. A defected Syrian general told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday that the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will never give up its chemical stockpile. ""The locations of most of the scientific research centers in Syria and the storage facilities are known and under surveillance, thus, he will give up those centers and facilities for sure without lying. That said, however, Bashar al-Assad will not give up the chemical stockpile,"" said Syrian Brig. Gen. Zaher al-Sakat. Al-Sakat said that he defected from the Syrian military after he was ordered to use chemical agents. He said he swapped the chemicals out for something non-toxic to fool his commanders. The general said that in addition to four secret locations within Syria, the regime is currently transferring chemical weapons to Iraq and Lebanon, an allegation that the commander of the opposition Free Syrian Army, Gen. Salim Idriss, also recently made to Amanpour. Lebanon and Iraq denied the claims at the time, and CNN's Barbara Starr reported that, if true, the claim would fundamentally shift the assessments of U.S. intelligence officials. The U.N. Security Council, capping a dramatic month of diplomacy, voted unanimously late Friday to require Syria to eliminate its arsenal of chemical weapons -- or face consequences. ""Today's resolution will ensure that the elimination of the Syrian chemical weapons program happens as soon as possible and with the utmost transparency and accountability,"" Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. The U.N. resolution was based on a deal struck this month between the United States and Russia that averted an American military strike over allegations the Syrian government used sarin nerve gas in an August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb. U.S. officials said it left at least 1,400 people dead. CNN's Mick Krever contributed to this report.","NEW: Syria will never give up its chemical stockpile, a defected general says .

"(CNN) -- Paul Sacco says searching for his daughter feels something like bleeding out. All the hope, heartache and anxiety that go into it leave him feeling diminished. But the Colorado lawyer and amateur guitarist has managed to bottle up some of that energy, spending hundreds of hours creating what is both a tribute to Aubrey Sacco and a monument to his sorrow: a 14-song album he has published to Internet vendors. ""Finding Aubrey"" includes 11 songs written and performed by Sacco at his home studio, as well as the last three songs Aubrey herself recorded at home before the 23-year-old disappeared in April 2010 while hiking alone in Nepal. The case is unsolved, and the album -- for sale on iTunes and other outlets -- is a fundraiser for an investigation into her disappearance. ""So many people who know us say, 'What is it like?' or 'I can't imagine what it's like to have your daughter go missing,' "" Paul Sacco said in a phone interview. ""The album tells the whole story: feeling helpless, feeling like you want to celebrate your daughter, feeling like she may never come back and diminishing yourself as you look for her."" Aubrey disappeared toward the end of a five-month post-college trip in Asia. The 2009 University of Colorado graduate, who had a double major in psychology and art, went to Sri Lanka to teach yoga to vacationers before traveling to India to study yoga and volunteer to help schoolchildren with music and art. She hoped to do charitable work, perhaps hooking up with a nongovernmental organization abroad, her dad said. But she vanished on the last stop of her trip, in Nepal's Langtang National Park, where she hiked for at least two days. She initially was believed to have made it as far as a particular village on the hike's second day, but villagers there changed their stories and said they didn't see her after all. Investigators don't know what happened to her and have yet to find any physical trace of her. Paul Sacco, 59, and his wife Connie have taken trips to Nepal to press the investigation, working with private investigators, Nepali police and the Nepali army to try to determine what happened. Between his job and his investigation, Sacco found at least three hours a day for more than a year to create the album. Playing all the instruments, supplying all the vocals and recording and mixing the tracks, he grieved through music. He came up with a first version last year before publishing the finished product in April. ""My counselor said that he felt that was extremely healthy for me as an outlet, because that was how (Aubrey and I) related to each other, through music and art,"" Sacco said. There are songs of tribute and nostalgia. ""Crayons in the Sun"" recalls Aubrey growing up -- painting, going to a father-daughter dance, wearing a homemade dress to graduation. ""I've written songs since I was 10 years old. I never wrote a song that I was crying onto the paper so much that the pen wouldn't write -- until then,"" Sacco said. The album also shows moments of determination. In ""The Great Divide,"" Sacco sings of moving heaven and Earth for her. ""Your pictures all hang in these empty rooms / I know you'll be here, soon,"" he sings. In much of the album, though, Sacco works through despair and isolation. ""Now we're the car wreck on the road / people turn their heads and drive away from here,"" he sings in ""A."" ""Stare into the Darkness"" speaks in part to the investigation's magnitude: ""Stare into the darkness / and it'll stare right back at you / from the other side of the world / I think it's going to run me through."" Listeners also get to hear Aubrey, in songs that Sacco asked her to record before she left. They used to play music together, and he knew she was working on a few songs in the months before her trip. ""The night she was packing for Sri Lanka, I asked her, 'Honey, I really want you to record these songs,' "" Sacco said. ""She said, 'Why?' I said, 'Just in case something happens to you.' "" Aubrey's songs were rough recordings, not meant to be final products. But Sacco is grateful to have them and says they ""give you a flavor of where she's coming from."" Sacco believes one of her songs, ""My Heart Knows,"" was an ""accept-me-for-who-I-am"" sort of song, addressed primarily to a romantic interest but possibly to whoever listens. ""Please let me be me / person you're afraid to be / but don't worry, I know where to go / I know, because my heart knows,"" Aubrey sings. Sacco, who didn't particularly want Aubrey traveling alone, said the song offers a good glimpse at his strong-willed daughter. He has sold several hundred copies so far, and that's a few hundred dollars more for the family's investigation fund. He's grateful to have had the chance to explain what he's feeling though music. Sacco hoped the disappearance would be solved by the time the album was done. Since he finished it, he hasn't been able to write much. The two relatively new half-songs he's written still are about Aubrey, but he says he doesn't have the energy to complete them. ""The biggest thing was to bury myself in my work at the law office (after the album),"" he said. ""That seems to be a good place to hide.""","Grieving over daughter's disappearance, Colorado man creates 14-song album .

"(CNN) -- Syria's government is waging ""a war of extermination"" against its own people, the prime minister of Qatar said Tuesday, according to state media, hours after a failed four-day ceasefire during a Muslim holiday left hundreds dead. In strongly worded comments to the Al Jazeera Arabic network, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani also accused foreign powers of standing by while President Bashar al-Assad's forces carried out a slaughter. ""What is happening in Syria is not a civil war but a genocide, a war of extermination with a license to kill by the Syrian government and the international community,"" he said, according to the official Qatar News Agency. Al Thani, who's also Qatar's foreign minister, said he had confidence in U.N.-Arab League envoy to Syria Lakhdar Brahimi -- but that his country did not trust Al-Assad's government. Brahimi had pushed for government forces and rebels to stop fighting during Eid al-Adha, a major Muslim holiday that began Friday and ended Monday. But it soon became clear the violence was continuing almost unabated. Syria rebels, Kurdish militia discuss cease-fire . ""When the Syrian government announced that it would comply with the truce, it also announced that its military would respond to anything that took place on the ground, and it was clear from this rhetoric that there was no truce,"" said Al Thani, according to QNA. ""Everyone knows what the solution is and what the Syrian people want. Everything that is happening now is a waste of time and just buying time to kill the Syrian people and to destroy the Syrian infrastructure."" The prime minister said he sensed ""a bigger awakening"" among Arab nations and in the wider international community over the crisis in Syria, despite moves by Russia and China to block tougher U.N. Security Council action. But, he said, a ""paralysis"" would prevent action until after the outcome of the U.S. elections. A group that documents the names of those killed in Syria's conflict, the Violation Documenting Center, calculated the total number of those killed during the failed ceasefire as 407. The report from the VDC, which works closely with the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria, put the total civilian toll at 32,013 over some 20 months of violence, with 2,900 government soldiers killed in the same period. The LCC said 163 people were killed Tuesday, mostly in Damascus and its suburbs, and in Idlib province, where airstrikes pummeled a residential neighborhood in the city of Maarat-al-Numan. Regime forces inflicted ""heavy losses"" on rebel fighters in clashes in the Damascus countryside and Hama provinces and near the city of Deir Ezzor, the Syrian Arab News Agency reported. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of violence or casualties as the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. The numbers reported by the LCC do not include deaths from security forces or the military. In other developments Tuesday: . General assassinated in Damascus . An air force general was assassinated Tuesday in the Syrian capital, Damascus, Syrian state media reported. Pilot Maj. Gen. Abdullah al-Khalidi was killed by ""an armed terrorist group"" in the Rukn-Eddin neighborhood of Damascus, SANA said. He was shot to death as he got out of his car, SANA reported. U.N. envoy visits Beijing . Brahimi headed to Beijing Tuesday to meet senior Chinese officials, a day after he held talks with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov for the first time on what to do about the Syrian civil war. The state-run China Daily newspaper quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei as saying the envoy would have ""in depth communication"" with Chinese officials during his two-day visit. China backs Brahimi's efforts to find a political solution to the crisis, rather than the use of force, Hong is quoted as saying. Following Monday's meeting in Moscow, Russia accused the United Nations of double standards for failing to condemn a car bombing in a pro-Assad stronghold near the capital, Damascus. Syria's foreign ministry also wrote to U.N Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to criticize the United Nation's failure to condemn such attacks -- an omission it said ""encouraged terrorists to continue committing crimes against the Syrian people."" Lavrov said on his own Twitter feed that Russia was disappointed at the lack of support for Brahimi's call for a holiday truce, but that it appreciated his efforts to try to ""find potential collaborative ways for the international community"" to help stabilize Syria. The Russian-French Security Cooperation Council will meet in Paris October 31, the foreign ministry said. Speaking after his meeting with Lavrov, Brahimi said neither side in Syria is showing signs of backing down. ""The government says they are fighting terrorists and only terrorists, and that it is their duty to do so -- to protect their people. And the other side says we're fighting a very cruel government that is persecuting us, and we're defending ourselves,"" Brahimi said after the meeting. He recalled speaking with a woman who has one son in the Syrian military and another son in the rebel Free Syrian Army. ""If that is not civil war, I don't know what is,"" Brahimi said. Diplomacy with Russia is a delicate dance. Russia, along with China, has repeatedly vetoed attempts at the U.N. Security Council to take stronger action against al-Assad. Many have accused Russia of backing the Syrian government, but Russia says it just wants a political solution for Syria determined by its own people.

"(CNN) -- Those souped-up water ski machines are ideal vacation-time fun but they've never been cheap. Thanks to British designer Ross Kemp, the world has been graced with a solar-powered watercraft that costs just a third of the price of your average powered water craft. Called ASAP, Kemp's creation is part ski, part surfboard and part catamaran. Powered by the sun, it's both free to run and fully sustainable. Read more: the smart streetlamp that will save energy . Why ASAP? ASAP stands for ""As Soon As Possible,"" reflecting the vessel's intended function as a rescue craft. Kemp dreamed up the idea while on a lifeguard training course, where he spotted a gap in the market for a more effective and more affordable water rescue vehicle. ""While doing my training, I found it incredibly hard to tow a body in the water and started looking at rescue equipment. I saw an opportunity to design something from scratch,"" says Kemp. ""A lot of rescue aids are simply re-purposed leisure equipment, for example a paddle board is just a surf board, and a Jet Ski is just adapted for rescue purposes, so rescuers adapt the way they rescue people to the equipment rather than the equipment for them."" ASAP, however, has been designed with rescue missions in mind. Kemp spent months studying on-duty lifeguards to get an idea of how his concept could better assist the process. In his final year as a design student at Loughborough University he developed the first ASAP prototype in a tent in his back garden. Read more: The earthquake-proof table that offers reliable shelter . So what makes it any good? Whereas traditional skiers can be cumbersome to get going, ASAP is lightweight and can be jumped on and launched immediately by one person. It has a sloping center platform to slide the injured onto quickly, getting them buoyant as soon as possible and its V-shaped catamaran hull means it cuts through waves to avoid slapping, making it much safer for towing a casualty. Kemp's creation is timely. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) drowning is the third leading cause of accidental death around the world, yet with rising fuel prices petrol skiers are becoming an increasingly unfeasible option for local and charity run rescue stations. At the moment ASAP can travel up to 15mph, but it's still under development: ""It's not going to have the super power of a Jet Ski but it will certainly take the lifeguard to the casualty much quicker than swimming. We're working on making the propulsion much stronger,"" says Kemp. CNN Blueprint set Kemp up with industrial design kingpin and mentor Ross Lovegrove, who loved the product but suggested he insert solar-powered lights so that ASAP glows as it goes. Although only at its second prototype, ASAP has already won an award for Best Startup Business in the UK Lloyds TSB Enterprise Awards and Kemp is thinking about how to expand: ""I'd love to be able to offer solar charging stations to local councils so they can charge their watercrafts whenever they need to."" And the good news is that soon he hopes to introduce his solar-powered watercraft to the leisure market, which means we won't need to undergo any grueling training or save any lives to give it a whirl.","ASAP is a solar-powered watercraft which combines skis, surfboard and catamaran .

"(CNN) -- As the world watched and waited for little Prince George to make his royal way into the world in London, Queen Elizabeth II was among those wishing the baby would hurry up. The reason? ""I'm going on holiday,"" the queen said days before the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to the future king on July 22. Thankfully, Prince George was born just in time for the queen to begin her official holiday last week at the royal family's Scottish retreat, Balmoral Castle. The queen and members of the royal family will spend the next two months at her 50,000-acre estate in the Scottish highlands. The castle was originally built by Queen Victoria and by all accounts of both historians and those who work on the estate, it holds a very special place in the queen's heart. That's likely because it offers her a level of privacy that she cannot find anywhere else. Every year at this time she travels to the heart of the Cairngorms National Park in Royal Deeside, just outside the small town of Ballater. Here, behind large metal gates that keep the public outside for most of the royal family's visit, she has the privacy to stroll with her corgis around the gardens, catch up on correspondence at her Honka Hut (a pine summer cottage that was a gift from the Finnish government and is one of the queen's favorite spots on the estate), go fly fishing on the river Dee, or take in a round of golf on her private course. But here's a secret that few people seem to know: You can have the same vacation. I'm not talking about visiting the estate for the day, as many people do when it's open to the public. Nope, you can move in. Settle down in one of five cottages on the estate, and you'll have access to everything that makes Balmoral so special. I speak from experience, having just returned from two weeks in one of the Colt Cottages. It wasn't my first visit to the castle; I've visited every year since I first learned about the holiday cottages four years ago. While the Colt Cottages are the smallest cottages available to rent, they are my favorite because of their close proximity to the castle -- just a couple hundred yards away. If you are looking for more room, there are larger cottages to choose from, all rented on a weekly basis. The largest cottage is Alltnaguibhsaich Lodge, which sleeps up to 13 people and sits farther away from the castle on the shores of Loch Muick. Rent for the cottages start around $750 a week (480 pounds), and vary depending on which cottage you choose and the time of the year. And you don't have to leave your dogs at home, they are welcome during your stay. The cottages are closed for most of August, September and early October for the royal family's official visit. The cottages are charming, comfortable and fully equipped, but don't expect crystal chandeliers and marble bathrooms. Although you're at Balmoral, it's more rustic than the Ritz. People often ask me what I do for two weeks in the highlands. Like the royal family, my vacation at the castle is spent outside, enjoying the natural beauty of the region. Practice your fly fishing on the River Dee by hiring the queen's ghillie as your guide for the day. Bring your clubs and play a round of the estate's private golf course. Or just wander around the estate, past waterfalls and through the ancient Caledonian forests. Thanks to the fact that this area is so far north (same latitude as southern Alaska) it stays light until around 10 p.m. during the summer. So grab a book and a picnic basket to enjoy dinner on the castle lawn. Grill some fresh fish and have a barbeque on the banks of the river. These excursions are only available to you, as a guest on the estate. After a couple of days it's hard not to feel like royalty. When you are finally ready to leave the estate, you can mingle with the locals at any of the cafes and pubs in the nearby villages of Ballater and Braemar. In addition to offering fresh, locally sourced food, both offer remarkably good shopping. There are several art galleries showcasing local artists, bookshops stocked with everything you'd want to read about the region and country shops where you'll be able to stock up on Harris Tweeds, Hunter boots and Barbour coats. If you want a real taste of Highland whiskey, there are tours and tastings at the Royal Lochnagar distillery, less than a mile from the estate, which has been producing whiskey since the mid 19th century. It's when the castle closes to the public at five o'clock that you really appreciate the uniqueness of staying at Balmoral. Without ""tourists"" around, the castle grounds are all yours to explore. The only thing you might worry about is running into your landlord. That's exactly what happened to me this summer while taking an evening walk around the castle. Several loud barking corgis ran up to say hello. It took a minute to realize that the elderly woman walking the dogs was Queen Elizabeth II. But this wasn't a typical celebrity sighting. I didn't take out my camera for a picture or ask for an autograph. We just waved, she called the dogs back, and both of us went back to enjoying our vacation at Balmoral Castle.","Cottages on the grounds of Balmoral Castle are available to the public for rent .

"Washington (CNN) -- With a potential diplomatic solution at hand in Syria and new signs emerging that Iran may be willing to halt its nuclear program, President Barack Obama will provide an updated assessment of the American approach to the Middle East during the annual United Nations General Assembly that begins Monday in New York. Obama currently is not slated to meet with Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, though the White House has not ruled out face-to-face diplomacy between the two leaders. Obama and Rouhani exchanged letters in the months since the Iranian president was elected in June, and on Friday Rouhani wrote in an opinion piece he was open to ""a constructive approach"" toward areas of contention with the United States, including its nuclear program. ""The fact of the matter is, we don't have a meeting scheduled with President Rouhani, but again, we're always open to diplomacy if we believe it can advance our objectives,"" Obama's deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, told reporters during a conference call Friday, adding that Obama has said since 2007 that he'd be willing to negotiate directly with Iran without preconditions. In addition to the letters with Obama and an op-ed piece in Friday's Washington Post, Rouhani has granted interviews to western news outlets, including one with CNN next week. ""We must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart,"" Rouhani wrote in the Post Friday. Publicly, the White House has viewed Rouhani's latest outreach attempts skeptically, saying U.S. officials will look for actions, not words, on halting nuclear enrichment. Rhodes said Friday that Rouhani's actions to date were ""clearly not sufficient to meet the concerns of the international community with regards to the nuclear program."" But the charm offensive, apparently sprung from tough economic sanctions currently in place in Iran, prompted speculation that Obama and Rouhani would meet at next week's U.N. general assembly. If they did, it would be the first meeting between an American president and Iranian counterpart since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. ""I can't predict every interaction that might take place at different levels at the U.N.; it's possible that there could be some interaction at different levels, but there's just simply none planned at this moment,"" Rhodes said later when asked if there were any scheduled meetings between members of the American and Iranian delegations. Obama will hold bilateral meetings next week with the leaders of Nigeria and Lebanon, as well as with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas -- the first time the two have met since direct Mideast peace negotiations restarted earlier this year. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to visit the White House at the end of September. During his address to the U.N. on Tuesday, Obama will use events in the Middle East and Africa to explain the evolving role of the United States in that area of the world, Rhodes said Friday. ""Given the complexity and breadth of challenge that we face in the region, the president will lay out an update of America's approach, how we see our interests, how we're going to be pursuing and prioritizing our policies going forward,"" he said. That address will include a section on Syria, and the use of chemical weapons there. The United States and Russia recently agreed on a diplomatic plan that would force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to forfeit his chemical weapons stockpile to international control. And Obama will reiterate his stance on Iran's nuclear program, while conveying his ""openness to diplomacy and the prospect for a peaceful resolution of this issue,"" Rhodes said.","The U.N.

"(CNN) -- You don't have to know the Netherlands well to be familiar with the story of Hans Brinker, the little Dutch boy who saved a nation from the sea in Mary Mapes Dodge's novel by plugging a leaking dyke with his finger. The tale may be fictional but it is symbolic of one tiny country's struggle against erstwhile indomitable elements and it is told the world over as an example of how the smallest of deeds -- or fingers in this case -- can have a huge impact on the lives of many. The low countries may have won their battle against the tide centuries ago but these days they face another fickle enemy: a housing crash so sharp it has left millions of homes financially high and dry with mortgages, as they would say in Dutch ""onder water."" WATCH MORE: German minister says 'I don't see' further bailouts . And now, just as Europe's southern states appear to have overcome the worst, a recession in one of the region's ""core"" countries could jeopardize a fragile recovery still very much in its infancy. As the eurozone's fifth largest economy, Holland and its surrounding provinces are hardly the bloc's economic engine but they are a key ally for Berlin in its push for stricter spending across the region. Through their finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch sit at the helm of the Eurogroup, the very body charged with steering member states' fiscal policy, exerting influence over larger neighbors like France and Italy. True, austerity has already cost the Dutch dear in the form of one collapsed government but this is a country which is under pressure to set an example. Going Dutch . As we all know, the Netherlands isn't just famous for its clogs and windmills. Its inhabitants have always been astute financiers and careful with costs. The expression to ""go Dutch"" is employed the world over when splitting a bill. And indeed it may seem ironic that a nation famous for its monetary prudence should find itself at the center of a debt storm. So how did this happen? READ OPINION: Eurozone recession over but it's too soon to celebrate . Sadly, like Brinker's story it's a familiar -- if predictable -- tale: An overheated housing market, inflated by readily available 100% mortgage offers, loans at five times salary and, worst of all, generous tax deductions on repayments, combined to create an incentive to buy, buy, buy. With property prices now plunging around 10% a year, a growing number of Dutchmen and women have become trapped in a negative equity spiral, littering their banks' books with bad loans. The country's financial institutions have already had 95 billion euros worth of aid since the 2008 crisis, but it's estimated they still hold 650 billion euros worth of property financing on their balance sheets. That's bigger than the Netherlands' GDP. If that doesn't raise eyebrows it may surprise you to learn that the Dutch have now won the dubious accolade of being the most indebted people in Europe, with outstanding consumer borrowings amounting 250% of available income. At 125%, Spain's figures pale in comparison-- ditto for other housing bingers like Ireland and Portugal. So much for the Dutch image of being Europe's great savers. Yet, as we have seen so often throughout this eurozone crisis, the act of saving when applied too late can often exacerbate an economy's decline. COMPLETE COVERAGE: Eurozone in crisis . As such, the Netherlands' current predicament offers a textbook example of the pitfalls of the ""slump-then-save"" mentality. With households tightening their belts to service mortgages, consumers' spending has plunged, prompting businesses to scale back on investments and shed staff. In just a few years the Netherlands has seen its jobless rate soar from an enviably low 5.5% at the start of last year to almost 9% in June. With unemployment rising month after month, the famously generous benefits system has become a luxury the country can ill-afford. Memories of a tulip bubble . Now a year into its recession, economists aren't forecasting a recovery for the Netherlands until 2014 at the earliest, and even then predictions are of a measly 0.4% growth. But don't be fooled: the Netherlands' economic landscape may be flat but it's not entirely bleak. Besides, the Dutch have been here before. While private sector debt may have been the country's undoing, sovereign bond investors have largely shrugged off the Netherlands' domestic woes -- giving the government breathing room on its borrowing costs. Dutch industry is competitive and flexible. The workforce is highly educated and polyglot, with the entrepreneurial streak reminiscent of a nation of merchant traders. READ MORE: Netherlands true blue pottery makers . In fact Holland and its neighboring counties have seen their fair share of boom and bust cycles. Its bubble in the tulip trade is a lesson taught in business schools across the globe as an example of how to spot an overvalued asset class. Just like those once precious bulbs, the Dutch economy will bloom again one day, though its flowers will appear later this cycle. Mind you, they will last longer if the lessons have been learned.","The Netherlands is suffering a housing crash that has left many in negative equity spiral .

"London (CNN) -- WikiLeaks said Thursday it has begun publishing some 2.4 million e-mails from Syrian politicians, government ministries and companies dating back to 2006. The e-mails, which are in a range of languages including Arabic and Russian, come from the ministries of presidential affairs, finance, information and foreign affairs, among others. According to WikiLeaks, the e-mails ""shine a light on the inner workings of the Syrian government and economy, but they also reveal how the West and Western companies say one thing and do another."" One e-mail shows an Italian company trying to get around U.S. sanctions on Syria and another indicates that the company was sending engineers and helicopter radio equipment to Syria as recently as February 2012. Syrian forces began their crackdown against protesters in March 2011 and that has sparked a grass-roots uprising and a bloody regime offensive against dissenters. WikiLeaks, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, has published about 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables, causing embarrassment to the government and others. It has also published hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents relating to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Its founder, Julian Assange, was arrested in Britain in 2010 over allegations of rape and sex crime charges in Sweden. Two women have accused Assange of sexually assaulting them in August 2010 when he was visiting Sweden in connection with a WikiLeaks release of internal U.S. military documents. Opinion: Australia to Assange's rescue? Don't hold your breath . He has been arrested in absentia, Swedish prosecutors have said. Swedish authorities want to question him about the allegations, which he denies. Assange has been fighting extradition ever since, saying the allegations are retribution for his organization's disclosure of American secrets. His bail conditions included staying every night at the home of a supporter outside London. Assange applied for asylum to Ecuador on June 19 and has been inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since then. It is unclear when Ecuador will decide on the request. He sought refuge at the embassy five days after the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom dismissed a bid to reopen his appeal of the decision to send him to Sweden -- his last option in British courts. A representative for the WikiLeaks founder said Assange will not honor a notice that British police served him requiring that he surrender to authorities. ""This should not be considered any sign of disrespect,"" said Susan Benn of the Julian Assange Defense Fund, who read the statement. Benn said the United States has empaneled a grand jury in its goal to press charges against Assange. Turning himself in would have started a process that would have ended with Assange's extradition to the United States, she said. ""It is clear that there is a plan to bring Julian Assange to the United States,"" she said. Citing what she called cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment of the alleged source of leaked documents, Pfc. Bradley Manning, Benn said that sending Assange to the United States ""would be a violation of his rights."" Police said Assange has violated the terms of his bail by staying at the embassy, and that ignoring the notice to turn himself in is a further violation. See yourself as the next Assange? Good luck .","One e-mail shows a company trying to get around U.S. sanctions .

"(CNN) -- As the Capitol Building came into view Tuesday morning, Lee Shull tried to help his neighbor Po Murray navigate their car into Washington. He's a 43-year-old software consultant. She's a mother of four. A week ago, they lived in a town and a neighborhood they thought was safe. Now their block in Sandy Hook is set off by caution tape. Inside a house 100 yards from Murray's front door, Nancy Lanza was found in her bed on Friday, a gunshot to her face. The killer, her 20-year-old son, Adam Lanza, took three of his mother's high-powered guns to Sandy Hook Elementary and murdered 20 first-graders and six adults. ""I cannot even tell you what that feels like to have that happen in your town. It was like we were grabbing for something, anything,"" said Shull. On Friday night, neighbors and friends starting calling each other. ""We all thought we have to do something,"" he said. ""That turned into, 'What are you doing Saturday? Can we get people together Saturday?'"" Remembering the victims . About 50 people got together Saturday, then Sunday and again Monday at the town's public library, the only place that could accommodate the growing crowd of 75-plus people. They decided to call themselves Newtown United. A Facebook and Twitter account were set up. Then they scrambled to find people in the group who could drop their jobs for a day or put off family obligations to go to Washington. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which holds perhaps the biggest pro-gun control megaphone in the country, was staging a press conference at the capital. Shull, Murray and Murray's 16-year-old daughter, Tess, just wanted to be a part of that, if only to stand and listen. They get that they're entering a foreign, complex and often ugly world of politics and ideology. ""Maybe that sounds like a pipe dream, and maybe that's arrogant,"" said Shull. ""But why not? If we fail, and maybe we will, but we don't know if we don't try."" So many victims, a long fight . At the press conference, more than 40 relatives of people who have been victims of gun violence spoke. One after another, they approached the microphone: . -- Mothers of an 8-year-old and a 27-year-old killed in the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shootings this July. -- A man who talked about his sister who was shot to death in a classroom in 2007 at Virginia Tech. -- A mother who held a picture of her 16-year-old son, gunned down the same year on a bus in Chicago. -- The sons of a member of the Sikh Temple in Wisconsin where a gunman murdered six in August. -- The mother of a little girl killed in the Tucson, Arizona, shooting that targeted former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords. Tom Mauser, the father of Daniel Mauser, who was one of 13 people killed at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, walked to the podium. He had on worn, gray sneakers. ""I am here today wearing my son's shoes,"" he said. ""It's amazing we have the same size shoes so I wear them, because he was a member of the debate team at Columbine High School, so I now wear his shoes in this great debate and it's a debate we need to have in this country."" Mauser knows what he's talking about. He's dedicated the past 13 years to urging politicians to pass stricter gun laws. Experts say the effort has been largely unsuccessful. Part of the reason for that rests with the troubled ban on assault weapons that passed in 1994 and was due to last 10 years. It expired in 2004 during President George W. Bush's administration. The specifics of that ban were complicated, critics said, which allowed for numerous loopholes. It also only applied to new gun purchases. Further, gun-control advocates are up against the National Rifle Association, which has 4 million members in the United States. This year, the NRA spent $17 million on federal elections. Annual gun sales in the United States total about $3.5 billion, according to CNN Money. ""It's not like the NRA represents some tiny splinter of American culture,"" said Paul Barrett, author of ""Glock: The Rise of America's Gun."" ""The liberal argument is that the NRA distorts democracy or bullies politicians. That's not true. They don't speak for cosmopolitan circles on the East or West Coast or the mayor of big cities,"" he said. ""They don't speak for populations of people who are affected by urban crime. But they do speak for many, many people who have guns and don't want those guns taken from them."" Barrett said he feels compassion for everyone in Newtown. But Newtown United is entering a fight tougher than they could possibly fathom at this stage, he added. ""They are entering into a very ideologically charged arena, and are going to run up against a very cynical, very complicated and well-practiced maelstrom,"" he said. ""I wish them the best but I would be surprised if they don't end up quite disillusioned having watched this process."" NRA breaks silences after shootings . Start with talking . Shull appreciates that. Neither he nor Murray have had the time in the past 72 hours to dive into the language of the ban on assault weapons, they said. But they want to, and intend to. While Shull said Newtown United wants to also address loopholes in mental health care and making schools safer, he stressed that the group generally is focused on one objective. They think it's achievable in the short-term. They want to sit down and talk to people who support gun rights. ""We have to sit down as adults and have an open dialogue and listen to that other person and find that middle ground,"" Shull told CNN. At least two politicians who were for gun rights, Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Warner of Virginia, said they would weigh supporting new proposed limits on firearms. The NRA has been silent, though Tuesday afternoon it announced it will hold a press conference Friday. Its Facebook page has been deactivated, and visitors are redirected to a bare-bones page where comments are disabled (although ""Likes"" are still allowed). Its Twitter account, which typically posts several times a day, also has been quiet. The group's last tweet, on Friday morning, was a promotional message that said, ""10 Days of NRA Giveaways -- Enter today for a chance to win an auto emergency tool!"" Newtown shooter's guns: What we know . An advocate for Newtown? Shull said there's hope within Newtown United that they'll have a major prizefighter in their corner -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California. She was one of the major backers of the 1994 assault weapons ban. Feinstein said she'll introduce the bill when Congress reconvenes in January and the same legislation will also be proposed in the House of Representatives. It will ban the sale, transfer, importation and possession of big clips, drums or strips that contain more than 10 bullets, she said. She added the caveat that ""900 specific weapons"" ...""will not fall under the bill."" President Barack Obama, she believes, will support the legislation. Back in Washington, Murray is weary but optimistic. ""Look at those beautiful babies,"" the mother said, her voice shaking. ""Look at those children at Sandy Hook. I just want to tell people in Washington to do what is right."" She's exhausted. So is her daughter Tess. The teenager's school was in lockdown on Friday. When she got home later in the day, all she could do was hug her parents. She casually says, ""The next time my school is on lockdown,"" perhaps not realizing that she thinks there will be another time, no matter the circumstances, when a school is afraid. ""I trust the teachers in my school and the faculty, especially after seeing how they reacted,"" she said. ""But I'm worried that everyone is going to be terrified. ""I know kids around the world feel the same way. They are going to know that this could happen to them. I just want to be a part of trying to change that.""","NEW: NRA announces it will hold a press conference on Friday .

"(CNN) -- Europe has dominated the Ryder Cup recently, winning five of the last six editions including the dramatic 2012 competition in Illinois. It's still early but the European women could be on the way to starting a streak of their own in the Solheim Cup. They took a 3-1 lead against the U.S. following the opening session of foursomes at the Colorado Golf Club on Friday. Besides making it back-to-back titles, a win in Parker, Colo., would give Europe a first ever victory on American soil. Swedish pair Anna Nordqvist and Caroline Hedwall earned Europe's first point by upsetting British Open champion Stacy Lewis and Lizette Salas 4 and 2 before Suzann Pettersen and Beatriz Recari topped Brittany Lang and Angela Stanford 2 and 1. While world No. 3 Pettersen is a veteran, Recari is one of six Solheim Cup rookies on the European team. She's joined by 17-year-old Charley Hull, who became the youngest participant in Solheim Cup history when she later played in the fourball matches. ""It's the most pressure I ever felt because it's not only for you, it's for a team and it's for something greater than yourself,"" Recari, twice a winner on the LPGA Tour this year, was quoted as saying by the LPGA's website. ""So you have a little extra pressure to hit the shots."" The U.S. got on the board when Solheim Cup standout Morgan Pressel teamed with Jessica Korda -- the daughter of retired tennis grand-slam winner Petr Korda -- to down Catriona Matthew and Jodi Ewart Shadoff 3 and 2. But the experienced pair of Cristie Kerr and Paula Creamer fell to Azahara Munoz and Karine Icher 2 and 1. ""We're all trying to take care of our own match and definitely getting off to a good start really helps,"" Hedwall was quoted as saying by the LPGA's website. Lewis' round began poorly and the world No. 2 behind Inbee Park was visibly frustrated, dropping her club at one stage after an errant drive. Pressel, though, improved to 8-2-2 in the Solheim Cup as she played alongside rookie Korda. ""We didn't make a lot of mistakes,"" she told the Golf Channel. ""We made a few but kept them to a minimum. Hit a lot of fairways and greens and made a couple of putts. Both of us made some pretty big par saves. ""We're good friends so it's a lot of fun to play together.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Police arrested at least 250 protesters and an opposition leader in Russia's capital Tuesday in a second day of demonstrations against parliamentary election results. Protesters decried what they described as electoral fraud in Sunday's national vote, which kept Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's party in power but significantly decreased the number of seats it holds in parliament. Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister turned vocal government opponent, told CNN he was among those detained at a rally. Putin's United Russia party held a separate demonstration. Police said there were about 8,000 people there. Tuesday's anti-Putin protests drew much smaller crowds than a similar rally in Moscow Monday, where thousands of demonstrators turned out for an event state news agency RIA Novosti described as the largest opposition demonstration in years. Protesters who turned out Tuesday were met with a firm response from security forces, who dispersed many and made arrests. But some analysts said the presence of protesters was a significant sign that could prove a turning point in Russian politics. Read Daniel Treisman's piece on the significance of the election . ""This isn't a surprise that the party got fewer votes. I think the real surprise are the number of people who went out on the street,"" said Toby Gati, a senior international adviser at the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld firm. As simmering anger over allegations of official corruption and economic stagnation appear to be boiling over, Putin has promised to make changes, including reshuffling his Cabinet. He said the losses his party suffered in Sunday's elections were inevitable. ""They are unavoidable for any political power, especially a political power that has held the responsibility for the state of a country for some time,"" he said after results were announced. One observer said Sunday's election results, which left United Russia with a slim majority in the 450-seat house, signal that the leader's grip on power was weakening. ""Whatever else they reveal, Sunday's results undercut the image, common in the West, of Putin's regime as an effective authoritarian state,"" Daniel Treisman, professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in a column for CNN. ""In fact, it is a regime that cannot even steal an election decisively."" Demonstrators at post-election rallies in Moscow and other Russian cities criticized widespread reports of ballot-rigging. ""What you're seeing ... are expectations of a middle class, of people who believe they have a right to participate in their political process. And the real tragedy of having people going out on the streets and express their frustration is that was the only avenue left to them,"" said Gati, who helped develop the United States' policy towards Russia during the Clinton administration. The opposition Other Russia party sent out invitations to the protest via Facebook under the title ""Is the Revolution Continuing? Yes!"" But Matthew Rojansky, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment, cautioned that this week's protests were fueled by the frustrations of a ""liberal fringe,"" not the majority of the population. ""The bulk of Russians still have enough to lose right now in the system, and still have negative memories of the last time a government went down. They're not terribly interested in feeding chaos,"" he said. ""It's not the Arab Spring on the streets of Moscow."" A preliminary report from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on Sunday's election said some political parties had been prevented from running and the vote was ""slanted in favor of the ruling party."" A draft report by the organization's election-observer mission details alleged attempts to stuff ballot boxes, manipulate voter lists and harass election monitors. The group, which monitors and promotes democracy and human rights in Europe, cited the lack of an independent body running the election or impartial news media. And there was ""undue interference of state authorities"" in the vote, the 56-member organization said in a statement. Speaking at a meeting of the organization in Vilnius, Lithuania, earlier Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for a ""full investigation"" of reported fraud and intimidation in the elections, citing ""serious concern"" about the vote. ""The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted,"" Clinton said, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov looked on. ""And that means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them."" Russia's Foreign Ministry dismissed the criticism Tuesday, saying ""statements of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton concerning the parliamentary elections in Russia, as well as similar comments of the White House and State Department officials, are unacceptable."" Russia expects that ""the U.S. will refrain from unfriendly invectives going against the common positive vector of development of our bilateral relations,"" the ministry said in an online statement. Shortly after Clinton spoke, the Central Election Commission announced that Putin's party suffered a large loss of seats in the election. United Russia will have 238 seats, down from more than 300 in the outgoing parliament, or Duma, Central Election Commission head Vladimir Churov announced, with 99.99% of ballots counted. Meanwhile, the Communist Party will have 92 seats, A Just Russia will have 64, and the Liberal Democrats will have 56, Churov said.

"(CNN) -- Europe's women hold a slender advantage over the U.S. team at the midway point of The 2013 Solheim Cup at the Colorado Golf Club on Saturday. The European team started the day 5-3 ahead after winning the opening day foursomes 3-1 and sharing the points in the afternoon four-balls. But the U.S. fought back in Saturday morning's foursomes to leave the match finely poised at 6.5 points to 5.5. It had looked as if the match was slipping away from the home side early on Saturday as Swedish pair Anna Nordqvist and Caroline Hedwall's recorded a sensational 2&1 win over Morgan Pressel and Jessica Korda in the opening match. Europe left it late to strike, but when they did it was decisive. Hedwell's birdie at the 16th put Europe one up before Nordqvist closed out the match in incredible style, breaking American hearts with a hole-in-one at the 180-yard par three 17th. ""It's an unbelievable feeling. They played tough but we holed the putts and it is amazing to finish that way. It was a perfectly struck seven iron,"" Nordqvist said, www.ladieseuropeantour.com reported. The hammer blow left the U.S. trailing 6-3, but Stacy Lewis and Paula Creamer immediately restored some hope with a hard fought one-hole victory over Azahara Munoz and Karine Icher. Another half point was gained soon after when the match between Brittany Lincicome and Lizette Salas and Catriona Matthew and Caroline Masson finished all-square. All eyes turned to the final match where Michelle Wie and Brittany Lang claimed a vital 2&1 win over European pairing Suzann Pettersen and Beatriz Recari. Midway through the afternoon fourballs, Europe hold the advantage in three matches with the U.S. up in one.","Europe lead U.S. 6.5 points to 5.5 at the midway point in the Solheim Cup .

"(CNN) -- On Thursday, we will link arms with more than 100 women and claim the street outside the House of Representatives. We will not move until the House recognizes that women and children are at the heart of the immigration debate, and reform must treat them fairly. Women and children constitute three-quarters of all immigrants to the United States, but the debate about immigration reform -- which has stalled in the House -- has largely ignored the disproportionate burden they bear in a system that is failing. Immigrant women make outsize contributions to our families, communities and country. But they are denied core American values -- the right to equal opportunity and equal treatment under the law. Although women make up 51% of U.S. immigrants, only 28% of work visas are given to them as principal holders. Women disproportionately work in paperless or informal economies -- as nannies, housekeepers, home health care workers -- that don't get awarded work visas. These jobs rarely provide proof of employment, such as a pay stub at the end of the week. While many immigrant men face this challenge as well, women are disproportionately affected by it. Immigration reform efforts that link eligibility for citizenship to proof of employment fail to recognize the essential work that many immigrant women provide in these crucial roles. The Senate bill allows for alternative ways to verify employment, such as an affidavit from a church or community-based nonprofit. And a bipartisan group of 13 women senators also recognized the need for a merit-based visa system that would include professions that women predominantly occupy. Unfortunately their amendment did not make it into the Senate bill. Because they so rarely get work visas, most immigrant women enter the United States as dependents on their spouses' visas and they are prohibited from working. This not only prevents many women from contributing their considerable talents and skills, it makes their immigration status entirely dependent on another person, creating a situation primed for abuse. An immigrant woman in an abusive relationship may not report her spouse to authorities or seek help for fear that she will lose her ability to remain in the country. A comprehensive reform bill should ensure that women have equal opportunity to receive work visas by allocating them among employment categories typically held by women, not just professions typically held by men. As baby boomers reach retirement age, the need for caregivers and domestic workers will skyrocket. Though these jobs are essential and in high demand, they are often less valued than the jobs -- typically held by men -- that are awarded work visas, such as in tech and finance. The way that most women enter the United States is through the family-based visa system. In fact, nearly 70% of immigrant women attain legal status this way. Unfortunately, the family visa system has an enormous backlog -- about 4 million people are stuck in it, the majority of whom are women and children. Some women are forced to wait for decades before being reunited with their families -- something that is unbearable even to contemplate for most parents. Comprehensive immigration must clear this backlog and keep families together. We were reminded during the 50th anniversary commemoration of the March on Washington that the most difficult and enduring change requires the personal commitment and courage of individuals acting together. As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other great leaders showed us, from time to time that can mean the willingness to be arrested for standing up for your most deeply held values and beliefs. Inspired by King and the campaigns that made up the civil rights movement, we are putting ourselves on the line at the Capitol as part of a national campaign, We Belong Together, to promote immigration laws that treat women fairly, that reflect our core American values. If they don't, we are diminished as a nation. Real reform includes a path to citizenship, keeps families together and upholds the family immigration system, provides protections for survivors of violence and against workplace abuses, protects the health and well-being of women and children, honors women's work inside and out of the home, and is not driven by a focus on enforcement. Every day, immigrant women from all walks of life demonstrate incredible courage and take enormous risks to contribute to the well-being and success of their families and loved ones. They move to the United States to give their children better lives; they work so that their families will have food on the table; they take care of the young and the old; they open businesses. Theirs is a story that defines this country. While the majority of Americans recognize that the time is now to fix our immigration system, the House has not acted. It seems intent on piecemeal measures that continue to keep women from contributing fully and keeping their families together. If getting arrested is what it takes to show the House we're serious, it's worth it. House members must have courage and unite, as we have, to pass immigration reform that treats women fairly and keeps families united. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ai-jen Poo and Terry O'Neill.","Ai-jen Poo, Terry O'Neill say immigration reform must bring equal treatment for women .

"(CNN) -- August 20, 2010 . Swedish prosecutors issue an arrest warrant for Julian Assange amid allegations of rape and molestation from two female Wikileaks volunteers earlier that month. The next day, the prosecutor's office announces it is rescinding the arrest warrant while the rape charge is unfounded. The molestation allegation remains. August 31, 2010 . Assange is questioned by Stockholm police and formally told of the charges against him, all of which he denies as a smear campaign.

November 18, 2010 . Swedish prosecutors announce the courts have approved their request to issue arrest warrants to question Assange, who is now in London. On November 20, the Stockholm Criminal Court issues an international arrest warrant for Assange, stating he is suspected of several counts of rape, sexual molestation and illegal use of force. Interpol later issues a ""red notice"" upon Sweden's request. December 8, 2010 . Assange turns himself in to London police. He is remanded in custody after an extradition hearing finds him a flight risk. On December 16, the court finalizes its decision to grant him conditional bail.

November 2, 2011 . After a series of hearings in July, the British High Court defers its decision until November, ultimately ruling against Assange's appeal. Assange has two weeks to seek the court's permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. December 5, 2011 . The High Court announces that Assange will be allowed to appeal its decision on the legal technicality of whether the Swedish public prosecutor is a judicial authority, a status needed to sign an arrest warrant.

"(CNN) -- The Afghan government says armed individuals who may be U.S. special forces carried out acts of torture and murder, allegations that spurred it to demand that members of the elite American military units leave a key province west of Kabul. The U.S. military says it is investigating. NATO's International Security Assistance Force must stop all special force operations out of Wardak province, an area west of the Afghan capital where the alleged horrors took place, Afghanistan's National Security Council demanded. And all U.S. special forces must be gone from the province within two weeks. At a meeting of the council, led by President Hamid Karzai, ""it became clear that armed individuals named as U.S. special force stationed in Wardak province engage in harassing, annoying, torturing and even murdering innocent people,"" Karzai's office said in a statement. It did not indicate who ""named"" the group a U.S. special force. Nine people ""disappeared in an operation by this suspicious force,"" according to the president's office. And in another incident, a student was taken from his home at night, and his ""tortured body with throat cut was found two days later under a bridge."" ""Such actions have caused local public resentment and hatred,"" Karzai's office said. It added that the United States rejects any suggestion that its special forces carried out any such operation. Afghan forces must protect people in the province ""by effectively stopping and bringing to justice any groups that enter peoples' homes in the name of special force and who engage in annoying, harassing and murdering innocent people,"" the statement said. ""We take all allegations of misconduct seriously and go to great lengths to determine the facts surrounding them,"" U.S. Forces-Afghanistan and the International Security Assistance Force said in a statement. Until military officials speak with Afghan officials about the issue, ""we are not in a position to comment further,"" the statement added. ""This is an important issue that we intend to fully discuss with our Afghan counterparts."" Last April, the United States and Afghanistan signed a deal giving Afghan authorities an effective veto over controversial special forces missions. The agreement prevents ISAF from conducting such operations without the explicit permission of Afghan officials, said a senior NATO official. And special operations forces will operate under Afghan law, said a statement from Karzai's office. The complex system fully""Afghanized"" such operations, putting Afghan commandos in the lead and giving American special forces a ""training and support role,"" a senior Afghan official said. Under the deal, U.S. special forces would be on the ground but would not enter the home of an Afghan unless specifically asked to do so by the Afghan commandos leading the operation, or by other Afghan officials, according to a senior NATO official. This pact followed months of recriminations against special operations raids, particularly at night, that have deeply offended some Afghans angry about foreigners entering their homes. U.S. officials have said such raids are vital to NATO's operation against insurgents.

"(CNN) -- Many saw the renaissance of American golfer Tom Watson at the recent British Open in Turnberry, as clear evidence that romance is alive and kicking in one of the world's most ancient of games. Tom Watson considers narrowly missing out on the British Open title. Little over a month shy of his 60th birthday, the winner of eight career majors defied the odds and the skeptics, to not only lead the championship for much of the duration, but to obdurately defy his advancing years and effects of a hip-replacement to come within a whisker of winning the Claret Jug for a sixth time. Somehow the wily wisdom of Watson provided the perfect approach to the infamously tough Turnberry links that had proved too much of a challenge for many a younger contender. But was this romance or just further proof that golf really is an old-man's game? Let us know your thoughts in the Sound Off below. It is maybe hard to swallow for fans of the pitch and putt but where else is the red-hot heat of global competition for one of the game's most desired trophies fought over by a man nearly three times older than some of his fellow competitors?  Watson talks to CNN about his near miss. ¬ª . World number one Tiger Woods was not just tamed but embarrassed.  Buffeted by the stiff, salt winds of the shoreline course, the task proved too tough for the 33-year-old - who missed a cut, for the third round, for only the second time in his professional career. The casualty list of whipper-snappers who withered away was long and included pre-tournament hopefuls Paul Casey, Padraig Harrington and Sergio Garcia among the numbers. Watson showed guts and great talent to come within a shot of winning the coveted trophy. Fans were captivated by the way the weather-beaten Stanford graduate, who last won a major in 1983, could roll back the years to evoke his famous victory on the same greens in 1977. A true great of the game and another vintage performance for a gracious man. But did the culmination of the Open not just highlight the fact that golf is less a pursuit of athletes and more an energetic game of chess with a bit more grass?","Tom Watson came within a shot of winning the 2009 British Open at Turnberry .

"Muirfield (CNN) -- It is a British Open Sunday dripping with potential storylines. Another sun-drenched day on Muirfield's links ended with Tiger Woods in the hunt to break his five-year major drought; standing in his way is a man gunning for his first at the 62nd attempt. Lee Westwood played in his first Open Championship 18 years ago and is still to claim his breakthrough title after years spent hovering around the game's top echelons. On increasingly parched terrain, the 40-year-old Englishman's much-maligned putting stroke held firm over the closing holes as he entered the sanctuary of the clubhouse on three-under, a lead of two shots. Woods lies locked on one-under with fellow American Hunter Mahan, whose 68 was the best round of the day, while Masters champion Adam Scott, from Australia, is a further shot back on level par. Day two: Veteran Jimenez leads at halfway . The tournament's overnight leader, Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez, slipped six shots off the pace after carding a disappointing 77 while Sweden's Henrik Stenson is in a clutch of players on one-over that includes two-time major winner Angel Cabrera. Westwood has come close on several occasions, finishing in the top five on no fewer than eight occasions, but his run of 61 majors without success is an unwanted record. Despite being on the precipice, he said he'll sleep soundly knowing he could be hours from filling the glaring hole in his golfing resume. ""I'm not in a high pressure situation because I'm going to go and have dinner and I'm so good with a knife and fork now I don't feel any pressure at all,"" he joked in a press conference. ""I'll think about winning the Open Championship tonight at some stage I'm sure -- I don't think there's anything wrong with picturing yourself holding the Claret Jug on the final green. ""But when it comes down to it tomorrow and I tee off about 3pm I'll be in the same frame of mind as I was today. ""Even though I haven't won a major championship I know what it takes to win one. It's just a case of going out there tomorrow and having confidence in my game."" Day one: Brain-dead play costs McIlroy . Woods, meanwhile, was upbeat about his chances of securing a 15th major, having grappled with a loss of form and a series of injuries since his last triumph, at the U.S. Open in 2008, when he played with Westwood on the final day. But with four PGA Tour titles under his belt already this season the 37-year-old has underlined his ability to close out tournaments. ""I'm only two back, there's only guy ahead of me and we'll see what they do tomorrow,"" Woods told a press conference. ""I noticed everybody this morning was leaving the ball short, couldn't get a ball in the hole. ""I'm looking forward to the challenge of it, I've been in this position before over the last five years. I've been in that mix and I'm in it again. ""Hopefully I can play well and win the tournament."" Unsurprisingly for a man into his 19th Open campaign, Westwood's popularity among the patrons of the tournament was cemented long ago, reflected in the vociferous thousands who cheered him on through his round. Debate: Single-sex clubs: Not just for golfers? One of the biggest roars was reserved for his eagle on the fifth hole, propelling him back into credit after an early bogey. A birdie on the seventh was immediately canceled out by dropped shots on eight and nine as he teetered towards the turn. Woods balanced two birdies with two bogeys on the front nine as both players began the homeward stretch on exactly the same score as they had set off with from the first tee. But it was Westwood whose nerve held strongest as the pair, and the swelled ranks of the gallery, winded their way back towards Muirfield's clubhouse, a landmark that has stood on the East Lothian coast since 1891. A birdie was a formality for Westwood after a delicate approach to the 14th but his round threatened to disintegrate on the par three 16th hole after shoving his tee shot into the thick rough that has tied many of the world's finest players in knots this week. After a fluffed second and a third that left him with much to do, the man who moved to Florida to hone his shot game holed a critical putt to limit the damage. Meanwhile Woods saw his birdie attempt shave the left side of the hole. It was to prove a costly miss when his tee shot on the 17th trickled into one of the many sand traps that complement these famous links. Woods missed a ten foot putt for par while Westwood made one of similar range to edge to three-under and prise open a slice of daylight between himself and the chasing pack. Mahan is also searching for his first major championship and his round of 68 was better than anything produced on the third day of competition. He'll be in the final pairing with Westwood on Sunday. ""You've got to have the belief before you can win it,"" Mahan explained to reporters. ""I think with trusting yourself you can go out there and do all kinds of great stuff."" U-Turns . But as the denouement of this great sporting drama enters its twilight hour, it is the names of Westwood and Woods that will burn the lips of fans who'll pour through the gates on the last day of competition. As the pair shook hands after regulation pars on the final green they departed knowing they are only 18 holes from ending the drought, but will it be five or 18 years of pain erased come Sunday evening in Scotland? Or will the agony of waiting continue? The wait for next year's British Open ended swiftly for Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee as he made a U-turn from London's Heathrow airport back to Edinburgh after finding out he had made the cut for the weekend. ""This is the first time in my life that this has happened to me but it was quite fun!"" said Thongchai, who added ruefully he had been looking forward to seeing his family in Thailand. Former Open champion Paul Lawrie had to abandon walking his dog after also heading home to Aberdeenshire only to find out he had also survived the cut.","England's Lee Westwood takes a two-shot lead after the third round of the British Open .

"(CNN) -- Webb Simpson made up for lost time at World Golf Championships Bridgestone Invitational Thursday by firing a six-under-par 64 to move one shot clear at the top of the leaderboard. Simpson, who missed the tournament last year due to the birth of his daughter, finished the opening day just ahead of Henrik Stenson with Tiger Woods a shot further back. But Rory McIlroy, who is set to defend his PGA Championship next week, finished six shots off the lead after a double bogey six at the par-four 10th left him with a round of 70. ""With the incredible field it draws every year, you know, this is a tournament you want to be in more than any others with the majors and the FedExCup events,"" Simpson told the official PGA website. ""You want to play where the best players in the world are playing."" Simpson, who won the U.S. Open last year, may have produced a series of impressive shots but it was the advice of his caddy, Paul Tesori, which made the difference. Tesori has caddied for some of the biggest names in golf at Firestone including Vijay Singh and his inside knowledge proved key, according to Simpson. ""It's hard for us players to listen to our caddies, but he basically showed me where to go and told me where to hit it, where the lines were, what clubs to hit,"" he said. ""I didn't feel like it was my first time because he had so much experience here. You know, had I been with a guy who had never been here, as well, I might have been a little more puzzled. ""We joked about it a little bit yesterday. I haven't listened to him this much since we got together in 2011. But it is nice to kind of have the pressure off me when I'm thinking about stuff."" Meanwhile, World No.1 Woods, who has won the WGC a record seven times, said he was pleased with his day's work after recording a four-under-par 66. ""I felt pretty good today,"" he told reporters. ""It was a little blustery, the wind was up and the greens were soft but at least the ball was flying. I feel very good about what I'm doing with basically my whole swing. I hit a lot of good shots. ""I had a really good feel for the distance today, and (caddie) Joey (LaCava) and I really read the wind right today. We changed a few shots out there, and we both had a really good handle on what we were doing feel-wise with the wind."" The 14-time major winner who last won at Firestone in 2009, rolled in four birdies in his final nine holes to move into contention at the front . ""I've played terrible coming in here and I've played really well coming in and, for some reason on this golf course, I just see it,"" he said. ""It's just one of those venues.

"(CNN) -- 49 years of age and still going strong, Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez delighted the Muirfield galleries to lead the British Open at the halfway stage Friday. Jimenez, a real crowd favorite with his flamboyant approach both on and off the course, drew on all his experience to card a level-par 71 for three-under 139. A strengthening wind and fast running greens and fairways made the famous links course in East Lothian a brutal test, with only a few golfers passing a stern examination. Among them, chasing his elusive 15th major, was World No.1 Tiger Woods, who also carded a 71 to be in a select group on two-under, one off the lead. Woods rolled in a confidence boosting birdie on the 18th and admitted conditions had been tough. ""It was difficult out there today,"" he told gathered reporters. Woods said patience would be the key over the weekend with conditions predicted to stay the same. ""Just continue plodding along. Just continue being patient, putting the ball in the right spots,"" he said. ""We're not going to get a lot of opportunities out there."" Woods has good company in the chasing group with 40-year-old Englishman Lee Westwood, who shot a joint best of the day 68, Swede Henrik Stenson and fellow American Dustin Johnson. Overnight leader Zach Johnson fell away with a 75 but is still in contention in the pack at one-under-par with Scotland's Martin Laird, Rafael Cabrera-Bello of Spain and Argentine veteran Angel Cabrera. Jimenez, who became the oldest winner on the European Tour earlier this season, said age should not be a barrier to success on the course. ""Only the young people can do it? I love what I'm doing. I play golf for a living. Same thing 25 years. I enjoy myself,"" he told the official British Open website. ""I keep elastic and flexible. I'm still able to shoot low and still here. Tomorrow if I cannot shoot low, I will not be here, you don't worry,"" he added with a smile. American Phil Mickelson looked set to take closer order, but a four-putt nightmare on the 16th showed the speed of the surfaces and set him back in his tracks. He ended with a three-over 74 for one-over 143, bracketed with reigning Masters champion Adam Scott of Australia, former Masters winners Bubba Watson and Charl Schwartzel, 2011 British Open winner Darren Clarke and England's Ian Poulter. But there will be no back to back major wins for Justin Rose as the English star missed the cut after his Merion heroics at the U.S. Open. Former World No.1's Rory McIlroy and Luke Donald will also not be around for the weekend despite the cut being made at seven-over-par. But defending champion Ernie Els of South Africa scraped in at six-over, along with former winners Padraig Harrington and Sandy Lyle.","49-year-old Miguel Angel Jimenez leads British Open .

"(CNN) -- Ernie Els insists his game is in good shape despite missing the cut at the Scottish Open days before his title defense at the British Open begins. On another day of low scores on the links course at Castle Stuart in the Scottish Highlands, Els did shoot at two-under par 70. But his five birdies came with three bogeys to leave him tied for 97th. His overall score was also at two under, 10 shots behind surprise leader Chris Doak of Scotland. ""I thought I played quite well today but I had no idea on these greens so I am glad I am leaving to get on some other greens,"" said Els. ""A missed cut is not great but we have had a great time here. ""I did not get the run of the course, it felt like it was against me, but I am playing nicely and gave myself a lot of opportunities. My game is where I want it to be. It did not quite go my way these last two days and I made a couple of silly errors, soft bogeys, yesterday. ""It's not the first cut I've missed and it won't be the last."" He hopes the next one, though, won't come at Muirfield next week. Doak, ranked 341st in his second full season on the European Tour, struck five birdies, one eagle and one bogey as she shot a six-under 66 for the second consecutive round. He has found it difficult to make an impact on the European Tour, only finishing once in the top 20 in his last 16 events. Doak, though, made his maiden appearance at a major at last month's U.S. Open at Merion. ""It's absolutely phenomenal to shoot 66-66 in the first two days,"" Doak told the European Tour's website. ""You start the week thinking you want to go low but to actually do it is fantastic. ""I just feel it has been coming all year but just maybe haven't put it all together. These two days, I've definitely put it together."" He leads four golfers by a shot, with Phil Mickelson -- the highest-ranked player in the field at No. 8 -- four shots behind Doak. The four-time major winner shot a 70, which wasn't as good as his 66 on Thursday. First-round leader John Parry is tied for 13th with Mickelson. Hindered by a pair of double bogeys, he followed his 64 with a par 72.","Ernie Els says his game is where he wants it to be despite missing the cut at Castle Stuart .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Tiger Woods has pulled out of this weekend's AT&T National to ensure he is ready for next month's British Open. The 14-time major winner has an ongoing left elbow injury which he first picked up on his way to winning last month's Players Championship. Woods' decision means he will not defend the title he won in 2012. ""I was examined after I returned home from the U.S. Open, and the doctors determined I have a left elbow strain,"" the 37-year-old told the PGA Tour's official website. The British Open, which will be held at Muirfield, begins on July 18. The American will be looking to win a first major title since the 2008 U.S. Open. Woods aggravated his injury at last week's U.S. Open at Merion, which saw him finish 13-over par in a tie for 32nd position. It was his worst performance in 16 appearances at the tournament. ""I have been advised to take a few weeks off, rest and undergo treatment,"" he added. ""I'll be ready to go for the British Open, and I'm looking forward to playing at Muirfield. ""I would like to extend my regrets to AT&T, our sponsors and the fans in the Washington, D.C., area. ""The AT&T National means a lot to me and my foundation. It's especially difficult not defending at my own tournament. It's going to be a great event, and I look forward to being there to provide my support."" Woods has enjoyed a stellar 2013 so far, regaining his position at the top of the world rankings and winning four PGA Tour titles.","Tiger Woods pulls out of this weekend's AT&T National tournament with an elbow injury .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to golf's sentimental favorites, Thomas Bjorn would have to be near the top of the list. The Dane famously blew a late lead at the British Open in 2003 and Ben Curtis took advantage to claim his lone major. It wasn't a collapse to match that of Jean Van de Velde in 1999 -- the Frenchman crumbled on the final hole and eventually lost in a playoff -- but the Claret Jug was in sight for Bjorn since he led by two shots with three holes to play. Bjorn's double-bogey five on the 16th at Royal St. George's in Sandwich, England effectively ended his hopes of capturing a maiden major and allowed the little known Curtis to triumph. Bjorn finished tied for second. He will get another opportunity to win the British Open and his first major after being given an exemption Monday for this year's tournament at Muirfield in Scotland that begins next week. Bjorn was one of five European Tour players to earn the exemption based on their Race to Dubai ranking. Since 2003 Bjorn has only finished in the top 40 at the British Open once, in 2011. He was fourth when the Open was once again held at Royal St. George's. And his only top-20 finish in any other major in the last 10 years came at the 2005 PGA Championship when he tied for second. But in his last five European Tour events, Bjorn registered three top-five finishes and sits 13th in the Race to Dubai. Among the other four European Tour players to be granted exemptions was South Africa's Richard Sterne, who finished second at the French Open after struggling on the back nine Sunday. Five spots went to PGA Tour counterparts based on their FedExCup ranking, with Billy Horschel highest in the standings at No. 5. Horschel tied for fourth at last month's U.S. Open and won the Zurich Open in New Orleans in April. Sweden's Jonas Blixt, meanwhile, led a list of eight players who earned their entry through the world rankings. Blixt won Sunday's rain affected Greenbrier Classic in West Virginia to see his ranking rise from 103rd to 51st.","Thomas Bjorn was one of five European Tour players to earn an exemption into the Open .

"(CNN) -- Brazil's 3-0 win over Spain in the Confederations Cup final brought to an end an event that was designed as a test run for the 2014 World Cup hosts. It was a tournament that was permeated by social unrest, with protesters partly unhappy over the degree of public money devoted to the staging of the World Cup. CNN looks at five things we learned from the event. 1. Neymar is the real deal . Neymar has been touted as the latest in a line of Brazilian superstars that stretches all the way back to the great Pele, but outside Brazil many were beginning to believe the hype surrounding the young star was just that. Prior to the Confederations Cup his performances for the national team had been lacklustre, particular in the 2-2 draw against Chile in April, when he was singled out for jeers by Brazil's own fans. While most would argue that he's in no position to judge, Marseille midfielder Joey Barton's Tweet likening Neymar to Justin Bieber, and something rather unpleasant relating to cats, seemed to sum up the views of many European observers. Following the Brazilian's $75 million transfer to Barcelona -- just before the tournament kicked off -- some were even suggesting the Catalan club had been fleeced by Brazilian side Santos. Not any more: this was no tantalizing glimpse of what La Liga fans might be watching next season, it was incontrovertible proof of what Neymar can bring. The 21-year-old produced a string of vibrant, flamboyant, but above all effective performances throughout the tournament, his goals and guile serving notice that he is every inch a superstar. 2. Time may be up for Buffon and company . After winning friends at Euro 2012, the Azzurri continued to show that the days of ""catenaccio"" are long gone, with some fast attacking football. Italy's run in the tournament was certainly invigorating, lurching from near disaster in an extraordinary first-half capitulation against Japan, to a sublime (albeit goalless) first-half domination of Spain. In the end they were well worth their third place, but it could and possibly should have been more. Gianluigi Buffon is widely and justifiably regarded as one of the world's finest goalkeepers; yet his penalty saves in the third place play-off against Uruguay masked his culpability in goals conceded at key moments in the tournament. This was not the dominant, steely-eyed Buffon of old -- particularly against Brazil, where he looked anything but solid. Likewise, there are other old hands whose time in the famous blue shirt may be nearing its end. Given Cesare Prandelli's reluctance to start AC Milan's exciting midfielder Stephan El Shaarawy, major surgery is unlikely. The Italian national side has always been resistant to change, as its ageing spine suggests, but it may need to pick up the pace of its evolution. The likes of Buffon and the peerless Andrea Pirlo may have one more big tournament in them, but Prandelli would do well to blood some fresh talent in the meantime, just in case -- especially given the physical demands next year's World Cup will present. 3. Protests are a wake-up call to FIFA and Brazil . For a country that is synonymous with football, there were times during this tournament when Brazil seemed to have fallen well and truly out of love with the game -- or at least, with FIFA and the Brazilian government's interpretation of what a World Cup should look like. As simmering social unrest threatened to boil into something more serious, the tournament's detractors grew in volume and number. Even former star striker Romario joined a critical chorus that cited ticket prices, infrastructure costs and a questionable legacy as reasons why the Confederations Cup, and next year's World Cup, were bad for Brazil. In anticipation of trouble, a reported 10,000 police were on duty in Rio de Janeiro ahead of Brazil's clash with Spain, but in the end protests were relatively low-key. Following their team's emphatic triumph over the world and European champions, crowds spilled out onto the street and into a carnival atmosphere. Clearly this story is not over, and there is much work to do; for now, however, football's primacy has been restored. In fact there was much cause for optimism on the pitch. This was a well-deserved win from a team that looks to be gaining in stature, and the atmosphere inside the Maracana for the final was profoundly imposing. Of course Brazil won the 2009 Confederations Cup before limping out in the quarterfinals in South Africa; but this time they will be at home. The World Cup will be a tougher test; but don't bet against them. 4. Spain needs a re-boot . Finally, after a seemingly interminable period of dominance, Spain's champions look to have been found out. For clues as to how, it is hard to see beyond the Germans. Italy really should have beaten the Spaniards after playing them off the park for significant chunks of their semi-final; Brazil's 3-0 defeat of the world champions was a muscular and ruthless final execution. Both owed much to the approaches of Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund in their UEFA Champions League defeats of Barcelona and Real Madrid. Spain were hustled and hassled, with attempts to impose their intricate passing game met by fiercely committed opponents, closing them down until the Europeans simply folded. Fernando Torres only won the golden boot because of his goals against Tahiti's part-timers. Xavi and Iniesta are still fabulously creative, but elsewhere Spain's weak links were exploited with a kind of physicality this team now seems incapable of countering. Drained of confidence, or possibly just appetite, they looked listless and in dire need of fresh ideas. The sight of a defender, Sergio Ramos, taking a penalty that could have brought them back into the final spoke volumes. True Brazil had had an extra day of rest before the final, but the mask of invincibility has slipped; Spain has 12 months to work out how to set it back in place. 5. The Confederations Cup comes of age . In theory at least, the Confederations Cup is the unloved second cousin of the World Cup, the Euros and the Copa America. Traditionally these games are seen by the cynics as little more than jumped up exhibition matches -- a mere aperitif before the main meal of the World Cup. By and large, no one really cares who wins. This time, however, something seemed to click. Maybe it was the location. Brazil may have some serious issues to confront, but there is something about the host country that elevated this tournament onto a different plane. In football terms, this is about as educated as any crowd can get. The enthusiastic way in which local fans adopted teams such as Japan, Uruguay, Tahiti and Italy conveyed atmosphere and meaning to fixtures where normally none would exist, and more than made up for the absence of traveling support. The outcome, for the neutrals at least, was first class entertainment. Brazil 2013 served up some of the most memorable international games of recent memory, played in front of passionate crowds in some spectacular arenas. If Brazil 2014 can pick up where this rehearsal left off, then we are truly in for a treat.","Brazil beat Spain 3-0 in Confederations Cup final .

"(CNN) -- He came into the final major of the golf season in confident mood but Tiger Woods was well off the pace after his opening round at the PGA Championship. The world No. 1, who won his fifth tournament of the 2013 season at the Bridgestone Invitational last week, had a poor final hole to end the day at 1-over-par, six strokes off the lead. He was tied for 50th along with second-ranked Phil Mickelson, who won last month's British Open. Masters champion Adam Scott and Jim Furyk, 2003 U.S. Open champion, shared the lead Thursday at 5-under 65. Woods, a 14-time major champion, has gone five years without adding to his collection and started well at Oak Hill in Rochester, New York, sitting on 2-under after 12 holes. But a bogey on the fourth hole -- his 13th having started on the 10th -- was added to by a double on his final hole and he slumped to an over-par tally. Despite his disappointment over the closing clutch of holes, Woods was content with his performance. ""I'm still right there,"" Woods told reporters at a press conference. ""I'm only six back and we've got a long way to go."" ""I played really well. I just hit a bad iron shot at four and didn't get up and down. ""One loose nine iron and ended up not having much of a shot after a decent tee shot on nine. I drew no lie at all. I didn't even get over the bunker. ""I made a few par putts out there as well. The round realistically could have been under par easily."" Canada's David Hearn and England's former world No. 1 Lee Westwood also had a strong start to the championship, finishing at four-under to be tied for second. American Matt Kuchar and England's Paul Casey were among a group a shot back. But Woods was, as ever, the main focus of attention on the first day, returning to the course where he produced his second worst display over 72 holes as a professional at the 2003 PGA Championship. He failed to maximize favorable conditions during his morning round. ""The first hour there was no wind,"" Woods said. ""On top of that, with the rain here, it softened everything up. That rain certainly helped things."" Furyk took full advantage to record six birdies in his first round, a bogey on the final hole not dampening his enthusiasm. ""Usually disappointed with ending the day on a bogey but 65 at the PGA is not so bad, so I'm feeling pretty good,"" Furyk told reporters. ""I'm happy I played a good round, but I'm wise enough and have been there enough to know it's only Thursday. Right now we're jockeying for position. ""You don't win the golf tournament on Thursday. I know that. Just happy with playing well and putting myself in a good position."" Defending champion Rory McIlroy was tied for 22nd after carding a 69, in a big group including the 2011 winner Keegan Bradley of the U.S., that year's British Open champion Darren Clarke and Spain's Sergio Garcia. ""I played a really good front nine,"" McIlroy told CNN. ""A couple of early bogeys halted that momentum but I made a good birdie again on 12. ""I played OK. I gave myself a couple of chances on the way in, didn't quite take them but to shoot a one-under opening round 69 here is definitely not a bad start."" Justin Rose, who won his first major title at June's U.S. Open, was tied for 11th on 68 in a group including Germany's former world No. 1 Martin Kaymer, Spanish veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez and Americans Steve Stricker, Bill Haas and Jason Dufner.","Jim Furyk, Adam Scott share lead at PGA Championship .

"(CNN) -- Roberto Castro enjoyed an impressive debut at the Players Championship, carding a nine-under-par round of 63 to tie the course record at TPC Sawgrass and top the leaderboard after day one of the $9.5 million tournament. Yet to record a PGA Tour win in his six-year career, the American equaled the record set by golf icons Fred Couples and Greg Norman to lead two-time major winner Rory McIlroy and 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson by three shots. ""Tiger Woods (didn't) play till this afternoon,"" Castro told the Tour's official website after a round which included seven birdies and an eagle at the second hole. ""So I'm sure some people were looking for something interesting to watch. ""The last two weeks I've hit the ball nicely, the scores just haven't shown it. A couple of rounds, especially in the last two weeks, could have been low. They weren't even remotely low on the scorecard, but had a couple of quality shots."" Playing alongside Castro was compatriot Jason Bohn, who suggested the 27-year-old's round could have been even better. ""It was a clinic,"" said Bohn, who was four under at the end of Thursday's play. ""It was beautiful. I've never seen a 63 shot like that. ""You see guys chip in or hole a bunker shot; but he shot 63 and it could've been two or three shots lower."" McIlroy enjoyed his best ever day at the event, having missed the cut and failed to break par on his three previous trips to Ponte Vedra Beach. The world No. 2 was part of a stellar threesome which also included recently crowned Masters champion Adam Scott -- playing for the first time since his Augusta triumph -- and 12-time PGA winner Steve Stricker. ""I think when you get all three guys playing well in a group, you sort of feed off one another,"" said McIlroy. ""It was a good group to be a part of."" Scott, who won the Players in 2004, was satisfied with his opening round of 69. ""I was a little surprised when I teed off that someone was five under already,"" explained the Australian. ""I thought it might play a little tougher than that. But it was ideal. ""There wasn't even a breath of wind hardly on the front nine. The greens seemed pretty receptive, too, so if you were in the fairway you could attack."" A slip up at the 18th dashed world No. 1 Tiger Woods' hopes of carding a first bogey-free round at the Players. The 14-time major winner carded six birdies during his round of 67, one stroke off his career best score at the event. ""I felt like I hit the ball good enough, but more importantly, I missed the ball in all the correct spots,"" said Woods, who is looking to win the tournament for the second time. ""I left myself some easy up and downs, and I was able to convert those up and downs.""","Roberto Castro leads Players Championship after record-equaling opening round .
