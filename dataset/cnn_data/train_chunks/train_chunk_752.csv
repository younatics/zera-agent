A new surgery simulation tool has been created that allows brain surgeons to develop their skills without having to risk the life of a real patient. The Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University, in Canada, is using the NeuroTouch Cranio, which is believed to be one of the most advanced brain surgery tools in the world. The device allows doctors to work out how to carry out complex procedures without the need to involve a patient. The NeuroTouch Cranio is believed to be one of the most advanced brain surgery tools in the world - it allows student surgeons to trial complex procedures without risking a patient's life . Live Science reports that the technology allows doctors to feel sensations similar to those felt during real brain surgery while they hold the surgical tools. The device also includes a screen which shows a high-definition simulation of a brain tumour and the effect that the tools and surgery are having on the tumour and the surrounding brain. Dr Hamed Azarnoush told Live Science: ‘Our main goal is to improve the resident training. Previously, they were receiving that directly from the operating room.’ The simulator is currently being used in training studies and it will be several years before it can be used to train career neurosurgeons. The developers believe that it could eventually allow much earlier detection of which trainee surgeons will succeed and which will not. This would mean that less time would be spent training people who were not cut out for surgery. The simulator is currently being used in training studies and it will be several years before it can be used to train career neurosurgeons . During the next trial, students will operate on a simulation of a brain tumour that is bleeding uncontrollably. The patient will die as the students work but they will be able to track the patient’s brain activity and heart rate. This will allow the students to learn what stresses are involved in carrying out operations such as this, and how to deal with them.","NeuroTouch Cranio allows surgeons to develop their skills and work out how to conduct complex operations .

Lucky escape: Joanne Durkin, pictured with her husband Patrick and son Daniel, was saved by a passing GP when her heart stopped as she was driving . A mother-of-two whose heart stopped as she was driving through a busy city centre was saved when a passer-by stepped in to give her CPR. Joanne Durkin, 43, was driving through York City Centre when her heart stopped and she collapsed behind the wheel. Staff from a nearby Turkish restaurant called Kapadokya saw the car roll to a stop and ran to the mother's aid. They then smashed a car window and pulled Mrs Durkin free from the vehicle. A woman, believed to be from Liverpool who was Christmas shopping in the city, identified herself as a GP. She then performed heart massage until paramedics arrived. Mrs Durkin said: 'You really couldn't make up what happened. It's amazing that so many different factors came together that day to save my life. 'I still feel tired, but I'm so thankful that everything is going to be okay. My guardian angel really must have been looking after me that day.' Mrs Durkin has no recollection of the incident but she, husband Patrick, and sons Matthew, 18, and Daniel, 11, have thanked the heroic members of the public and the emergency services. The mother was later diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome - an electrical disturbance to the heart and can cause death. Mrs . Durkin has been fitted with an implant with a built-in defibrillator . which will restart her heart should this ever happen again, and she is . on medication to help control her heart rate. Mr Durkin, 51, said: 'She was given a blast with the defibrillator and brought back round. 'Her heart stopped again in the ambulance but they started her up again and got her to A&E. She was just so lucky that someone was there at the time to help her. Scene: The mother-of-two was driving past the Kapadoyka restaurant in York, pictured, when her heart stopped. 'The car came to a stop with no damage. It's miraculous really because obviously she just blacked out. She's been unlucky, but there's been so much luck involved it's unbelievable.' '[Long QT Syndrome] can be classed as instant death syndrome which is quite a scary thing to think about. 'Ten minutes later she would have been in the middle of nowhere on a much quieter road and it would have been a much different story. 'She had just minutes to survive. It was just unbelieveable. She ran the marathon in October, she runs all over the place, she's as fit as a fiddle. 'I would have thought there would be more chance of Stonehenge falling over than Joanne falling over.' Erdal Ozturkce, manager of Kapadokya, was one of the people who helped Joanne at the scene, and was amazed to find out she was well and at home for Christmas. Diagnosis: Mrs Durkin has since been diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome, an electrical disturbance of the heart . He said: 'Her face changed colour when her heart stopped and we thought she was dead. I'm really very happy she's okay, it's really good to hear. 'I'm really happy she's alive, because we were really very upset. I didn't know her at all, but she's human and young, and it would be very sad for someone to die at Christmas time.' The mother is now launching an appeal to thank the GP who helped to save her life when her heart stopped while she was behind the wheel.

PUBLISHED: . 12:25 EST, 26 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 21:59 EST, 26 January 2014 . Margaret Rohner worried about her troubled adult son not taking his psychiatric medications and had been trying to find him proper care in the years leading up to her horrifying murder at his hands. The 45-year-old Rohner was viciously attacked Dec 26 with a fireplace poker and knife, her torso butchered and her intestines pulled out by son Robert O. Rankin, who was charged with murder after police said he confessed to the killing. It was a tragic end for a woman who had spent years trying to find appropriate care for her son she called Bobby, a person she desperately wanted to help after doctors took him off medication prescribed to treat schizophrenia. Better times: This 2012 photo shows Margaret Rohner, left, with her son Bobby Rankin one year before he brutally murdered her the day after Christmas . Friends say she spent four years guiding Bobby through hospitalizations, changing medications and doctors, and various treatment programs for his mental illness without much improvement in his mental state. The recent breast cancer survivor, was rewarded for her efforts by bearing the brunt of Bobby's angry rants while holding out hope that her only child would find the right combination of treatment. 'He was in and out of that system for four years, and all we ended up with was a disaster, a tragedy,' Robert Rankin Jr., Rohner's former husband and Bobby's father, said in an interview. Rankin said his son has been diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. The case highlights many of the issues state policymakers have been wrestling with in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting by 20-year-old Adam Lanza, who killed his mother before gunning down 20 first-graders and six educators on Dec. 14, 2012. One task force is compiling recommendations for legislators to consider regarding mental health services for patients ages 16 to 25. State Sen. Dante Bartolomeo, who has pushed for improved mental health services for children, said one challenge for young people with psychiatric problems is that once they become adults, treatment is generally voluntary and ""medication compliance does become a problem."" Another commission is looking into whether Lanza's mother had difficulty accessing treatment services for her son, who was diagnosed with a form of autism that isn't associated with violent behavior. Coming undone: Rankin became aggressive towards his mother when he was taken off his medication . Horrible act: Bobby Rankin gutted his own mother and disemboweled her with a poker because he believed she had ruined his life - he had been off his schizophrenia medication . On Friday, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy announced that his new budget will include additional funding for mental health care, including residential and transitional services for young adults with serious mental illness, something Rohner was hoping to find for her son. Bobby Rankin, who hasn't entered a plea to the murder charge, is being held at Garner Correctional Institution in Newtown. His attorney, Dennis P. McMahon, said Bobby has serious psychological problems and he's been advised not to visit him because of his fragile mental condition. 'He's struggling with this now,' McMahon said. 'I don't think he understands what is happening.' Several of Rohner's friends and customers described her steadfast efforts to fight for the right treatment for her son and her dream to find him long-term, supportive housing. Sally D'Aquila, who hired Rohner to clean her house and work on her garden, said Rohner would frequently be on the phone with doctors and social workers, trying to manage her son's care. D'Aquila said Rohner 'wanted so desperately for him to be normal, if there is such an animal.' 'I think she often felt there was nothing there. She was just on her own with no one to help her,' D'Aquila said. 'That's a pretty lonely place to be.' Patricia Unan, a close friend, said Rohner expressed frustration to her Dec. 19 about Bobby's deteriorating mental condition since he stopped taking his medications. Bobby for months had been receiving residential respite services offered at River Valley Services in Middletown, a program run by the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, according to Bobby's father. 'She told me she'd pleaded with the person she spoke with (at River Valley Services) to hospitalize him and force meds because she recognized when he was headed for a break down from previous experiences,' Unan wrote in an email. 'She said they told her they wanted to wait until after the holiday to address the situation.' Afraid: Rankin's mother wanted him to get help because she was afraid he might harm her .

Man with a plan: Bobby Rankin told police he sliced his mother from the belly button up before pulling out her intestines 'to see if there was a baby in her stomach' Mary Mason, a DMHAS spokeswoman, . couldn't confirm whether Bobby was a client, citing patient . confidentiality laws. But she described the respite program as a . voluntary alternative to a hospitalization, where temporary, supportive . housing is provided. She said patients can check themselves out but need . to notify staff when they're leaving. Bobby's . father picked him up Dec. 23, not wanting his son to spend the holiday . away from family. The elder Rankin understood Rohner didn't want Bobby . to come to her house because he hadn't been taking his medications, . which often prompted outbursts directed at his mother. Robert . Rankin Jr. said Bobby, who wore his hair closely cropped and a bushy . beard, appeared distant, but he saw nothing out of the ordinary and the . staff didn't express any concerns. In hindsight, he doesn't believe his . son should have been allowed to go home. 'I'm sure Margaret told them more than once, `When he's not on his meds, I'm threatened by him,' Rankin said. Rankin . and Rohner have been divorced for about 20 years but remained friends . and lived about a half mile apart. When they saw each other on Christmas . Eve, Rankin said Rohner told him that she wanted to see Bobby on . Christmas and give him presents. 'She basically said, `How's he been?' And I said, `Fine, for the most part.

Craig Michael Wood, 45, is facing first-degree murder, kidnapping and armed criminal action charges in the death of Hailey Owens, who was taken from the street in front of horrified witnesses while walking home from a friend's house Tuesday evening in Springfield. He could be sentenced to death if convicted. Hailey's body was found in his basement early Wednesday - stuffed in two trash bags inside plastic storage containers.

Tragic: Craig Michael Wood, 45, is facing first-degree murder, kidnapping and armed criminal action charges in the death of Hailey Owens, pictured . Hailey Owens: Witnesses say a man grabbed Hailey from in front of a neighbor’s home and drove away in a gold 2008 Ford Ranger Tuesday afternoon . Authorities won't officially confirm . that the body is Hailey's until after an autopsy, but Springfield Police . Chief Paul Williams said 'we have a high degree of confidence' in the . preliminary identification, which indicates that it is the girl. Wood was inside a truck parked outside his small, single-story home in Springfield when police arrested him Tuesday night, just hours after the abduction. The truck is owned by the suspect's parents, Jim and Regina Wood, who told authorities their son drove the vehicle. The 45-year-old was holding a roll of duct tape in his hands when officers arrived, the statement said. Wood agreed to go to police headquarters for an interview where he denied having any contact with his alleged victim. According . to Greene County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Patterson, who filed the . charges with tears in his eyes late Wednesday afternoon, Wood grabbed the girl as several . residents watched in horror and later shot her in the back of the head in his home. A spent .22 caliber shell casing was also found in the basement of his home. There was also evidence that her wrists had been tied, according to the probable cause statement, though no other details about what happened between the kidnapping and her death have been released. Witnesses . told investigators that a man in a gold 2008 Ford Ranger pickup truck . drove down the street several times before abducting Hailey. They said they heard the driver ask the girl where 'Springfield Street' was. She turned to walk away from the vehicle before the driver opened the door and said, 'Hey come here a minute.' Owens took a step or two toward the truck before 'the male then lunged out of the vehicle' and grabbed her. Charged: Craig Michael Wood, 45, was taken into custody on Tuesday night, about three hours after Hailey Owens was abducted from a street near her Springfield home . Investigation: Police and FBI agents investigate the scene where Craig Michael Wood was arrested in Springfield, Missouri, on Wednesday . Williams . said the witnesses called 911 to report the truck's license number. Resident . Ricky Riggins told the Springfield News-Leader he chased the fleeing . pickup in his car after a neighbor tried to pull the girl away. 'I couldn't keep up,' Riggins told the newspaper. 'He was probably five to six cars ahead of me. ... It was so fast.' Hailey . did not attend Pleasant View School, where Wood worked. She was a . student at Westport Elementary School this year, and attended Bowerman . Elementary School last year. Williams said the girl and Wood apparently didn't know each other. 'There's no connection that we've been able to determine at this time between the victim and the suspect,' the chief said. Hailey's aunt, Erin Petersen, believes the suspect was on a mission to find a girl Tuesday night. 'And it just so happened he found my girl,' she told the News-Leader tearfully Wednesday. Petersen and her husband, Rex, with other family members were out searching for Hailey from the time she was abducted until police reported finding a body in the early hours Wednesday morning. 'Who could sleep when your child is missing? We just prayed for the best and prepared for the worst,' she said. In shock: Hailey's mother, Stacey Barfield, pictured, is in denial about her daughter's death, the girl's aunt said . She told the newspaper she was furious and confused at what happened. 'How can he be human and treat another human like that? ... I just don't understand it.' Hailey's mother, Stacey Barfield, is being 'very strong' but is still in denial, Petersen said. 'She's not angry yet; she hasn't even . had a good cry in private,' she said. 'She broke down on my shoulder, . briefly. She said, ""I'm not going to have my little Mini anymore.""' Petersen described Hailey as 'an absolute ray of sunshine.' Tearing up, she told the News-Leader the 10-year-old loved to play in the dirt, but also loved to dress up and wear sequins. She said Hailey collected rocks, climbed trees and loved to wear her aunt's shoes around the house. 'She loved hugs and kisses,' she said. 'She loved babies, she loved animals, she loved to be outside.' Rex Petersen said Hailey was 'so good with the kids, she was just so loving.' In a tribute, he wrote, 'She fought hard ... the little hero did not back down. She was a warrior.' Springfield . school officials said Wood is a seventh-grade football coach and . teacher's aide who supervises in-school suspensions at Pleasant View . School, which has students in kindergarten through eighth grade. Norm . Ridder, the Springfield district's superintendent, said in a statement . Wednesday that Wood began working for the district in August 1998. He . said Wood has been suspended since his arrest. Wood . was initially hired as a temporary employee who worked as a substitute . teacher before he was hired full time in 2006, school district . spokeswoman Teresa Bledsoe said later Wednesday. He has coached football . at Pleasant View since 1998 and was also an assistant boys' basketball . coach. Crime scene: Woods was charged Wednesday with first-degree murder in the death of a 10-year-old girl. A body believed to be that of Hailey Owens was found Wednesday at the home owned by Wood, Police Chief Paul Williams said at a news conference . 'He met all of our . qualifications for employment,' Bledsoe said, noting that the . Springfield district has a more rigorous background check requirement . than state law, with an additional screening designed to detect . substantiated allegations of child abuse or neglect as well as any past . criminal violations. A . records search shows Wood had little criminal history. He pleaded guilty . to possession of a controlled substance in 1990 in Greene County and . was fined $100. Wood also was convicted in 2001 for illegal taking of . wildlife, the News-Leader reported. Williams said police have no idea of a motive for the killing. He said Wood has not talked to investigators since his arrest. The News-Leader also spoke with the . suspect's father, Jim Wood, who claimed he didn't know about the Amber . Alert until he got home Tuesday and found police waiting for him. He told the newspaper on Wednesday, 'He's my son, and he's in a lot of trouble.' FBI agents searched a nearby laundry business early Wednesday. Attendant Tress Brown wasn't allowed to enter the building until law enforcement had gone through the contents of a washing machine and two dryers, according to the News-Leader. 'He was washing away his evidence, I am guessing,' Brown said. Approximately 35 police and FBI arrived at Wood's home to search his property and his Ford Ranger Tuesday night. Sad: The witness reports triggered a multi-state Amber Alert, Springfield police said on Wednesday . Police said they also found evidence of foul play in the area but offered no other details at that time. Witnesses . told police they saw a man — matching Wood's description — abduct . Hailey near her home in the 3200 block of W. Lombard Street shortly . before 5 p.m. Tuesday. They . said the man approached her, asked her for directions and then pulled . her into a 2008 gold Ford Ranger with Missouri tags 1YF454 or 1YS454. A . witness, Carlos Edwards, told a News-Leader photographer he saw the . girl being abducted as he and his wife sat in the garage of their home. Edwards . said the suspect drove up and down the street several times before . pulling up alongside the girl and asking her if she knew the location of . Springfield Street before grabbing her. Edwards said he tried to run after the truck as his wife got the license number and called 911. A . Springfield Public Schools employee database shows that Craig M.

'He works as a paraprofessional and athletic coach at Pleasant View K-8 School. His employment has been suspended until this matter is resolved.' Initially, Hailey's abduction triggered a multi-state Amber Alert, Springfield police said on Wednesday. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation canceled a statewide Amber Alert for the 10-year-old and reported on their website Wednesday that at 7 a.m. local time, Springfield police 'announced that they had a suspect in custody and that (Hailey) was deceased.' Wood is being held in the Greene County jail, according to the jail's online booking records. On Tuesday, Hailey's mother said she was trying to stay strong.

Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has finalised his divorce from Veronica Lario, leaving him free to marry a woman almost 50 years his junior. Despite being younger than some of his children, Francesca Pascale, 28, now seems set to become the billionaire's third wife, with Italian media reporting she has already purchased a wedding dress. The divorce comes five years after Lario, 57, said she could no longer tolerate the 77-year-old's 'consorting with minors' after spending 24 years married to the politician. The end: Silvio Berlusconi has finalised his divorce from Veronica Lario (left) five years after she said she could no longer tolerate the 77-year-old's 'consorting with minors'. The pair were married for 24 years . Number three? Despite being younger than some of his children, 28-year-old Francesca Pascale (right) now seems set to become the billionaire's third wife . Although the divorce has been finalised, it is understood that Berlusconi and Lario and still in dispute the financial settlement, following a long and bitter legal battle. A court initially awarded Lario, who has three children with Berlusconi, . €3million a month but the amount was subsequently reduced to €1.4million . after an appeal. Lario has launched a counter appeal against that decision, with the final ruling yet to be delivered. The divorce has hit Berlusconi's finances hard - a situation exasperated by a lack of dividends from his business empire Mediaset. In January, Italian media reported that he had cut off monthly payments of €2,500 euros to a host of young models and dancers who attended his parties. The women, known as ""Olgettine"" after the street in Milan where they lived in apartments paid for by Berlusconi, were heard on wiretaps calling for more cash, which they referred to as 'flowers' or 'fuel'. In 2007 Berlusconi was quoted telling Miss Venezuela Aida Yespica (right): 'I'll go with you anywhere'. Last year he was convicted of paying Karima El Mahroug, also known as Ruby the Heartstealer (left), for underage sex . Out of control: Pascale, right, rarely seen far from Berlusconi's side and often clutching a white dog, was recently quoted as saying she kept tabs on her boyfriend's household spending . It was Berlusconi's colourful social life that drove Lario to divorce him. She announced her separation from him in May 2009, saying in an open letter to the media that she could not 'remain with a man who cavorts with minors'. It is now considered likely the 77-year-old will marry his current love interest, 28-year-old Pascale. According to several gossip websites, including Dagospia, Berlusconi's girlfriend has already bought her wedding dress. Pascale, rarely seen far from Berlusconi's side and often clutching a white dog, was recently quoted as saying she had to keep tabs on her boyfriend's out-of-control household spending. Berlusconi is currently in the process of moving to a luxury apartment in central Rome where the rent will be less than the €2.1 million a year he pays for a palace nearby, according to La Repubblica. He is currently embroiled in three court cases, and last week went on trial for allegedly bribing a senator. The former premier is also appealing a prison sentence for having sex with an underage 17-year-old prostitute and abuse of office, and another for leaking a confidential police wiretap.","Former Italian Prime Minister divorced Lario, 57, after 24 years of marriage .

Thefts of iPads, tablets and Kindles have soared by 10 per cent this year on Britain's railways (file picture posed by model) Thefts of iPads, tablets and Kindles on Britain's railways have soared this year, while thefts of laptops and computers have gone down. This year there was a 10 per cent increase in the number of iPad, tablet and Kindle thefts reported across the UK's rail network, figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by right-of-centre think-tank Parliament Street showed. Thefts of these items have been increasing year on year since 2008, according to the British Transport Police (BTP) statistics. Of the 949 reported iPad, Tablet and Kindle thefts this year, only 2 per cent were recovered by their owners. Meanwhile there were 22 per cent fewer laptops and computers stolen on trains this year compared with last year. Thefts of laptops and computers have decreased each year since 2010. Of the 1,061 items stolen this year, just 3 per cent were reclaimed. Michael Levi, Professor of Criminology at Cardiff University, said: 'People steal what they can steal easily and can easily resell for a price that makes the risk worthwhile. 'Laptops and computers often require more effort to gain access to, and their resale has a much narrower market since tablets and Kindles emerged - their legitimate sales are also falling.' He added: 'Password protection and other features are ok for reducing the scale of damage, but the potential offender does not know this at the time of theft and so it is not a deterrent until people stop buying stolen ones. 'With the rise of cloud services, less valuable irreplaceable data is actually held on the machine itself.' There was a decrease in the number of mobile phones reported stolen by commuters this year compared with last year. Before that, the number mobile phone thefts had been increasing each year since 2009. This year, 6,436 phones were stolen, of which 2 per cent were reclaimed. The figures from the British Transport Police show that 22 per cent fewer laptops and computers were stolen this year (file picture posed by model) Professor Levi explained why so few devices are reclaimed: 'People who are insured usually lose interest and have no legal claim once they are paid out. 'The insurers may need to do more in this regard but they often just write the loss off.' Steven George-Hilley, director of technology at Parliament Street, said: 'The explosion of tablets and shiny new devices is clearly proving a top target for thieves on the transport network. 'It is vital that consumers are vigilant and transport police impose tough penalties on the criminals targeting hard-working commuters.' A BTP spokesman said: 'Although this year is the ninth consecutive year that crime has fallen, the targeting of high-tech devices such as smartphones and tablets, and organised pickpocketing activity, has created a rise in theft offences. 'This increase in theft of passenger property, particularly those targeting smartphone and tablets, reflect the growing problem throughout London and the UK.' There was also a decrease in the number of mobile phones reported stolen by commuters (file picture posed by model) Earlier this year, BTP launched Operation Magnum in a bid to crackdown on pickpockets, gadget-grabbers and luggage thieves across the rail network. The BTP spokesman added: 'Indications show that it is having an impact, with the total number of thefts across England, Scotland and Wales between April and October this year down 6.1 per cent compared with the same period last year. 'However, we are not complacent, and we will continue to run Operation Magnum over the festive period to drive down crime in an increasingly busy environment.' The figures cover underground, some metro and tram systems as well as National Rail services in the UK. A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group said: 'Overall, crime on the railway has fallen but the rise in some crimes will be a cause for concern for passengers so we will continue to work closely with the police to crack down on offenders.'","Nearly 1,000 iPads, tablets and Kindles have been reported stolen this year .

The actor and his ex-girlfriend fell into each other's arms and exchanged a smooch. For several minutes, the happy couple stood hugging, holding hands and chattering excitedly. During an interview that followed, the childhood lovebirds, sitting next to one another, reminisced about the past and the last time they saw each other, which was 40 years ago. Lustig and Patinkin first met in kindergarten and remained close friends through high school. 'The Princess Bride' star revealed that he used to do magic shows with another girl named Sandy, while Miss Lustig recalled with a smile how in second grade, Patinkin sent her a birthday invitation where he addressed her as 'honey.'

Mrs Haynes, sporting a silver bob and fashionable glasses, said she is married and has three children in their late 20s, one of whom was on hand in the audience to witness his mother's reunion with her former paramour with whom she was 'living in sin,' as Mr Patinkin jokingly remarked. 'I'm not your father, am I?' the actor quipped, addressing Lenore's handsome son in the crowd. Mr Patinkin, who lives in High Falls, New York, with his family, was delighted to learn that like his grammar school girlfriend, Mrs Haynes also resides in Texas. 'I'm moving!' he exclaimed. After all the excitement of the two reunions, the Tony-winning and Golden Globe -nominated actor concluded his appearance on the daytime talk show by talking about his voiceover work in the Japanese animated film ‘The Wind Rises,’ which is up for an Academy Award this year.

A California couple who bought the house where Walt Disney was born 112 years ago plan to turn it into a historical site and museum. Brent Young and his wife Dina Benadon bought the home and hope it will serve as a 'community resource with a mission of enhancing and exploring childhood creativity.' The couple, who run a Los Angeles animation studio, said restoration is scheduled to start next month, and hope the project can be completed by what would have been Disney's 113th birthday, on December 5, 2014. Walt Disney birthplace: This house in Chicago's Hermosa neighborhood is the childhood home of the legendary animator . Walt's childhood bedroom? Disney lived in the home, which his father built and his mom designed, until he was 4 years old . Good deal? The new owners Brent Young and Dina Benadon bought the home for $173,000 after it sat on, and sometimes off, the market for 6 years . Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel declared December 5, which is the late animator's birthday, Walt Disney Day in the city . The development so thrilled Chicago leaders that Mayor Rahm Emanuel actually marked it by declaring the day Walt Disney Day. The couple announced on their website that they hope to raise $500,000 for the renovations, with donors receiving prizes, ranging from having their names listed in a book in the house to a one-night stay there. The two-flat home is located in the Hermosa neighborhood on Chicago's northwest side. It's said to have been designed by Disney's mother, Flora, and built by his carpenter father, Elias. Walt and his brother, Roy, were born there and lived there until Walt was 4 years old. On . Benadon and Young's website, Roy Patrick Disney, Roy Disney's grandson, . said the family was pleased that the house was 'being restored to its . humble origins.' The circa 1890s house sold for $173,000 in June after six years of going on and off the market. 'That . these two amazing men came out of that average neighborhood — anyone . can do it,' Benadon told the Chicago Tribune. 'There seems to be a great . symbol for the neighborhood and for Chicago and the American Dream.' Historic home? The home has never been granted historic status, partially because of extensive renovations that removed the 1890s charms . Young and Benadon intend to turn the home into a 'historical site, museum and a community resource with the mission of enhancing and exploring childhood creativity' 'That these two amazing men came out of that average neighborhood ¿ anyone can do it,' Benadon said, referring to Disney's brother and business partner Roy . 'There seems to be a great symbol for the neighborhood and for Chicago and the American Dream,' Benadon said of the home's rich history . Hopeful home: The couple and their renovation team have launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise $500,000 for renovations . When Disney's father built the home, Hermosa--now a predominantly working class, Hispanic area--was a new Chicago neighborhood. Because of subsequent renovations and, according to Curbed, Disney's 'well-documented bigotry,' a mid-90s landmarks committee chose not to grant the home landmark status. Young and Benadon hope to change that and win landmark status. 'We're hoping that there's something in there,' Young said. 'Walt's original cartoon drawings of the little mouse in the corner, maybe.'

His grandfather sits on California's death row, and his father avoided a death sentence by pleading guilty to killing two Oregon girls. Now Francis Weaver, 31, is one of three men charged with murder in what Canby, Ore., police describe as a drug deal gone bad. Police allege Weaver and co-conspirators sought to steal drugs last weekend from a Grants Pass man whose car contained 15 pounds of marijuana. The victim, 43-year-old Edward Spangler, was shot in the face and shoulder. Francis Weaver (left) , 31, son of  rapist and murderer Ward Weaver III (right) was charged with homicide . Weaver and the other men, 27-year-old Michael A. Orren and 32-year-old Shannon Bettencourt, were arraigned on Tuesday in an Oregon City court. A court clerk said they did not enter pleas and have yet to be assigned attorneys. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for next week. Weaver's father, Ward III, was convicted of aggravated murder in 2004, two years after the bodies of Ashley Pond and Miranda Gaddis were found in his backyard. Before the discovery, the search for the 12-year-old Pond and 13-year-old Gaddis riveted Oregon for months and put the missing girls on the cover of People magazine. It was Francis Weaver, then 19, who finally ended the mystery by calling emergency dispatchers to report that his girlfriend accused Ward Weaver of raping her, and his father had privately admitted to killing the girls. Micheal Orren (left), 27, and Shannon Bettencourt (right), 32, were also charged with the homicide . In the early 1980s, Francis Weaver's grandfather, Ward Jr., was convicted of killing a man whose car had broken down and of kidnapping, raping and murdering the man's girlfriend, 23-year-old Barbara Levoy. Her body was found buried beneath a deck at his home in Oroville, Calif. Maria Shaw, Francis Weaver's mother, said on Wednesday her son is not the biological son of Ward Weaver III. Asked who is the father, she said it was either a now-deceased Marine named Richard or a man who was in the Navy named Christopher. 'I don't know which one of those two is the real dad,' she said. 'At the time, I was raped by Ward and I wanted revenge. I didn't want to be with Ward. I just wanted to get away from him.' Shaw, who eventually divorced Weaver in the 1990s, said her son had nothing to do with Spangler's death. 'He's not guilty,' she said. 'They want (to arrest) him so bad because they think he's Ward Weaver's son.' Ashley Pond ( left), 12, and Miranda Goddis (right), 13, were killed by Ward Weaver III . The investigation began shortly before 5 a.m. Sunday when Canby police officers were called to a small park near the apartment where Shaw lives and Francis Weaver sometimes stays. Officers found Spangler's body next to a car that crashed into a tree. Police documents obtained from the Clackamas County Jail said the men had been tracking Spangler for three hours in an attempt to steal the marijuana, with Weaver exchanging text messages with Orren. Minutes before the homicide, Orren was directed to a back parking lot at the apartment building, where he allegedly met Spangler. A probable-cause statement written by Detective Brett Ethington said Orren was identified as the shooter and the gun believed to be used in the killing has been recovered. Additional documents from the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office show Weaver was arrested on an assault charge Jan. 25 and heroin was found in his pocket.","Francis Weaver, 31, is one of three men charged with murder in what Canby, Ore., police describe as a drug deal gone bad .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 18:44 EST, 19 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:17 EST, 19 February 2014 . Former federal prison inmate #03128-095 is running for Congress in Louisiana – and he happens to be the state's former governor. Edwin Edwards, a popular pol in his day, will try to make a political comeback despite his federal racketeering conviction 12 years ago and his advanced age: The Democrat is 86 years old. Edwards told Bloomberg News on Wednesday that he'll try to win the seat held by Republican Bill Cassidy, who's vacating it to run for the U.S. Senate. 'I'm the only hope the Democrats have here,' the disgraced four-term governor said. And the kind of voters who will dismiss him because he's a convicted felon, he reasoned, 'wouldn't have voted for me anyway.' This is not a plot from a reality show, although Edwards has already starred in one. Before the deluge: Edwards, then 73, was sentenced to 10 years in the federal slammer for kickback schemes involving prison construction and casino licenses . 'I'm only as old as the woman I feel,' Edwards quipped when he married Trina, a blonde bombshell less than half his age who was his prison pen pal . A&E aired eight episodes of 'The Governor's Wife' in October and November. It's an inside look at his relationship with 35-year-old Trina, a blonde prison pen pal who married him when he finished his sentence. 'I don’t know how it happened or why it happened but I absolutely fell in love with him,' Trina told Fox News in 2013. 'And besides that, he doesn’t have as much money as most people think. So I’d be a pretty poor gold digger if that’s what I was in for.' Trina gave birth to a baby boy on August 1 – he was conceived via IVF. She is also step-mother to the former governor's two daughters, who are in their 60s. Edwards insists he's serious, saying he's 'just figuring out all the legalities and how to set up a super PAC, and then I'm going.' That could be illegal in itself: Super PACs are independent political committees that aren't allowed to coordinate with the candidates they support. But there were no Super PACs in the 1960s, the last time he ran for Congress – and won. 'Vote For the Crook: It's Important': Edwards once ran for governor against Louisiana Ku Klux Klan founder David Duke (C), also prompting the slogan 'Vote for the Lizard, Not the Wizard' Edwards retired from the governor's mansion in 1995 after four terms -- not all in a row -- and sported clothes that looked much like the prison-wear he would have to wear for more than eight years beginning in 2001 . Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy is vacating his seat to run for the U.S> Senate, leaving an opportunity that Edwards, straight-faced, says he's ready to grab . Edwards was sentenced to 10 years in the slammer – he served eight and a half – for racketeering, extortion, money laundering, mail fraud and wire fraud in connection with a kickback scheme involving a for-profit company that built prisons all across America. Patrick Graham, the company's principal, testified that Edwards took an $845,000 kickback in exchange for green-lighting a plan to locate a new juvenile correction facility in the Louisiana town of Jena. Edwards was a congressman in the late 1960s when he decided to run for governor, a position that made him wildly popular in his first two terms . San Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo also admitted that Edwards helped him get a casino license in the state – a favor that cost him $400,000. Before he traded in his pinstriped suits for prison garb, Edwards squared off against David Duke, an avowed white supremacist, for his fourth and final term as governor. The two were forced into a runoff election in 1991 after the incumbent, Democrat Buddy Roemer, placed behind both of them on Election Day. It was Roemer who had bounced Edwards out of office four years earlier. Public sentiment against Duke, the founder of the Louisiana Ku Klux Klan, was so intense that Edwards won handily, 61 to 39 per cent – even though his own public corruption was among the worst-kept secrets in the Pelican State. Ultimately, Edwards won because he was seen as friendly to minority voters, a quality that trumped the public's disdain for crooked politicians. Republican U.S. President George H.W. Bush publicly advocated for him, seeing Edwards as the lesser of two evils. 'Vote For the Crook. It's Important,' read one popular political bumper sticker at the time. 'Vote for the Lizard, not the Wizard,' read another. It's unclear what his slogans might be in 2014, or if his Republican opponent's name will rhyme with 'geezer.'","Edwin Edwards, 86, is plotting a return to politics after serving nearly 9 years in prison for racketeering, extortion and money laundering .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:07 EST, 19 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:06 EST, 19 February 2014 . Arrest: Ketut Pujayasa has been charged with attempted murder and sexual abuse . A Holland America cruise ship worker has been  arrested in Florida after admitting that he raped and beat an American passenger during a nude cruise, before trying to throw her overboard. Ketut Pujayasa, a room service attendant on the Nieuw Amsterdam, claimed he attacked the 31-year-old because she insulted him when he tried to deliver her breakfast on Valentine's Day. The 28-year-old, from Indonesia, told the FBI he used a master key to break into the passenger's room at night time, and attacked her in her bed. The woman, who was on a Bare Necessities nudist cruise, was saved after a fellow passenger pounded on her guestroom door, allegedly scaring off Pujayasa who claims to have jumped to a lower balcony to escape. Pujayasa allegedly told police he decided to attack the woman, who has not been named, after she told him: 'Wait a minute, son of a b****' when he knocked on her door with her breakfast. 'Pujayasa stated that the passenger's . comment of ""son of a bitch"" was offensive to himself and his parents. He . was angry and upset the rest of the day,' FBI Special Agent David Nunez . wrote in a report seen by the Sun Sentinel. The steward had considered hitting the woman when he spotted her on a deck later in the day, but decided it was too crowded, he told police. He allegedly used a master key to get in the passenger's room, and waited on the balcony for the woman to return to her room that night, then hit her with a laptop and tried to choke her with the cord from curling tongs and a phone wire. His victim fought back, biting him, striking at his exposed genitals and using a corkscrew to try to stab him, Pujayasa reportedly told the FBI. He claimed that he wanted to throw the woman into the sea, while the ship was passing by Roatan, Honduras. After her attacker was scared off, the victim fled to a hallway where a fellow passenger found her covered in blood and wearing only a tank top. Specialist tour: The passenger was on a Bare Necessities tour, which caters to nudist travelers . Ordeal: The 31-year-old passenger had been vacationing on Holland America's cruise ship, Nieuw Amsterdam . 'The passenger also noted that [the . victim] had a curling iron wrapped and tangled around her neck and/or . hair. He also described [her] as having black eyes and visible bruising . around her neck and shoulders. '[The woman], fearing death was imminent, . asked the passenger to relay to her family how much she loved them,' the FBI report stated. The cruise ship docked in Honduras and the victim was airlifted to a Florida hospital. Security guards on the ship detained Pujayasa until they arrived in the Everglades on Sunday. The victim had been on an eight-day . cruise with nudist vacation specialists Bare Necessities, which took in . Jamaica, the Bahamas and Honduras on a voyage that left Florida on . February 9. As well as traveling to exotic . destinations, guests were able to take part in couples massage, Tantra . classes, a production of the Vagina Monologues and a Captain's party, according to the travel company's website. Guests on the cruises, which had been run previously on the Nieuw Amsterdam, are required to wear clothes only when the ship is in port, or when they are at dinner or attending the Captain's party. In a statement to Mail Online, Nancy Tiemann, the co-owner of Bare Necessities, said: 'We are deeply saddened by the incident that occurred on one of our cruise ship charters last week and are encouraged by reports that our passenger is recovering from her injuries.' 'Our hearts go out to our passenger and we stand ready to aid her in any way possible. It would be a disservice to our cruise guest to comment on what is a most difficult and disturbing incident,' she added. Clothes-free: Bare Necessities has run previous nudist tours on the cruise ship . Pujayasa has been charged with attempted murder and aggravated sexual abuse. Holland America has fired the employee, who had worked for the company since 2012. The cruise company told the Daily News he had been subject to a careful screening, had no criminal record and had no performance issues before the alleged attack. 'We continue to work closely with . authorities to understand how this incident occurred and what additional . actions we can take to help ensure that nothing like this ever happens . again,' a statement from the company said.","Victim had phone cord wrapped round her neck in vicious attack .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 20:20 EST, 19 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:47 EST, 19 February 2014 . A once-prominent Aspen, Colorado socialite charged in the 1996 Tucson car bomb killing of her ex-husband had nothing to gain from his death and is the victim of overzealous authorities who failed to follow other leads, the woman's lawyer said on Wednesday during opening statements in her trial. Prosecutors, however, described Pamela Phillips as a gold digger who hired a former boyfriend to kill businessman Gary Triano to collect on a $2 million life insurance policy. They say she wanted the payout to maintain her lavish lifestyle as her finances dwindled. It's been nearly two decades since Triano died when his car exploded as he was leaving a Tucson-area country club after playing golf. Defendant Pamela Phillips listens to her attorney talk to the jury as opening arguments commenced today . Department of Public Safety and the Pima County Sheriff's office look over the car in which Tucson developer Gary Triano was killed when it exploded in the La Paloma Country Club parking lot in Tucson . Authorities say Phillips paid ex-boyfriend Ronald Young $400,000 to carry out the hit. Young was convicted in 2010 and sentenced to two life terms in prison, but jurors aren't allowed to consider his case while determining Phillips' fate. Phillips, 56, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. 'Gary Triano lived on the edge, the financial edge ... He borrowed a lot of money from all sorts of people, many people who maybe were connected with organized crime,' defense attorney Paul Eckerstrom told jurors. 'That's who we think did this. That's who killed Gary Triano, not Pamela Phillips.' Prosecutors presented a wildly different theory of a woman who grew accustomed to the high life and found herself struggling financially with an easy way out. 'There is one reason that Gary Triano was murdered. One reason. He was murdered because his death benefited Pamela Phillips in a big way - $2 million is a hell of a motive,' prosecutor Nicol Green said. Ronald Young (left) was convicted of killing Gary Triano (right) in 2010 and is serving two life sentences . Triano was a developer who made millions investing in Indian bingo halls and slot-machine parlors in Arizona and California before Congress authorized tribes to open full-blown casinos. But after the real estate market declined and he lost control of his gambling interests, Triano went broke. That's around the time Phillips filed for divorce, prosecutors say, because Triano could no longer support her expensive tastes. 'All of a sudden, the lifestyle that this defendant insisted on and expected was no longer there,' Green said. The couple, who had two children together, separated, but Phillips remained the beneficiary of Triano's insurance policy, paying the premiums herself. She eventually moved to Aspen and worked in real estate before meeting Young. The two would soon hatch a plan to kill Triano and collect on the policy, Green said. 'They were talking about it for years,' Green said. Defendant Pamela Phillip, center, listens to her attorney as opening arguments started in her trial today . Young later left Aspen while being investigated by police for fraud, and turned up in Tucson briefly in the summer of 1996. 'The reason he comes to Tucson was that he and Pamela Phillips had already agreed to kill Gary Triano,' Green said. After the killing, Young was on the run from a warrant for his arrest in Colorado on fraud charges while Phillips was sending him money for the hit, eventually adding up to $400,000, Green told jurors. The investigation into Triano's killing stalled until Young's arrest in 2005. Authorities say he kept detailed records of his financial transactions with Phillips, including recorded telephone conversations and invoices. Green said police also found divorce records pertaining to Phillips and Triano in a van rented by Young. That's when Young and Phillips became the key suspects. By then, Phillips had received the $2 million insurance payout and had left Aspen for a life abroad. She was arrested in Austria in 2009 and extradited to Tucson. Her case was delayed after a judge ruled she was mentally unfit to stand trial at the time. Phillips' attorneys, meanwhile, say the evidence against her is flimsy, and that Phillips was already wealthy with her own money. They say Young didn't even kill Triano, raising the specter that it could have been a hit by a jilted investor, one of whom Triano was about to file a $10 million lawsuit against. 'So when the state tells you that nobody else had anything to benefit from Gary Triano's death ... that's just not true,' Eckerstrom said. 'There's people out there that are angry with him ... And remember, benefit can be driven by revenge.'","Prosecutors argue that Pamela Phillips arranged for her ex-boyfriend to kill her ex-husband in order to collect a $2 million life insurance policy .

In an unprecedented legal move, summonses have been issued against Thomas Monson over allegations the church's request that followers pay a 'tithe' - ten per cent of their income - could be in breach of the Fraud Act 2006 . The head of the Mormon church has been summoned to appear before British magistrates over claims the organisation’s teachings amount to fraud. In an unprecedented legal move, summonses have been issued against Thomas Monson over allegations the church’s request that followers pay a ‘tithe’ - ten per cent of their income - could be in breach of the Fraud Act 2006. Mr Monson, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, was warned by Westminster Magistrates’ Court that failure to attend a hearing on March 14 ‘may result in a warrant for your arrest’. The summonses - described by legal experts as among the most unusual documents ever issued by a British court - queries seven Mormon teachings. They were issued after a private prosecution bid by London-based Tom Phillips, author of Mormonthink, a website highly critical of the church and its teachings. Virtually identical documents were sent to Mr Monson naming former Mormon Bishop Stephen Bloor and former convert Christopher Denis Ralph as victims of the alleged fraud. The summonses were brought under little-used legal procedures where people who say they have evidence that someone has committed a crime can ask a magistrate to issue a summons for them to attend court. District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe, who signed the summonses, accuses Mr Monson of ‘dishonestly’ making a gain for himself or another’ by asking two men to pay tithes on the basis of ‘untrue or misleading’ representations. Among Mormon teachings queried are that the Book of Mormon was translated from ancient gold plates, that native Americans are descended from an Israelite family which left Jerusalem in 600BC and that all humans are descended from two people who lived 6,000 years ago. The Mormon Church - also known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - dismissed the summonses as containing ‘bizarre allegations’. Last night Mormon officials said that Mr Monson had no plans to attend the court case. Mr Monson, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, was warned by Westminster Magistrates' Court that failure to attend a hearing on March 14 'may result in a warrant for your arrest' The district judge would then decide whether or not to proceed with a case. Palestinian activist used similar powers in 2009 to seek an arrest warrant issued against the Israeli justice minister, Tzipi Livni, leading to an international diplomatic incident. Mr Phillips said: ‘The head of the Mormon Church has been summoned to a court to answer allegations of fraud – I don’t think a judge at Westminster Magistrates’ Court would sign off on ‘bizarre allegations’ – I certainly hope they never would. ‘This has been a very serious matter that has been looked at in extreme detail.’ Malcolm Adcock, the Mormon church’s public affairs director for Europe, said: ‘The Church occasionally receives documents like this that seek to draw attention to an individual’s personal grievance or embarrass church leaders. ‘These bizarre allegations fit into that category.’ Phillips’ complaint is based on the Fraud Act of 2006, a British law that prohibits false representations made to secure a profit or to cause someone to lose money. Conviction may carry a prison sentence of up to 10 years. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Summonses issued against Thomas Monson in unprecedented legal move .

The Virtual Dementia Tour alters senses and perception to simulate the day-to-day experiences of people with neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s. Users are given glasses which only allow tunnel vision and insoles which cause pins and needles. It also uses headphones which play constant background noise and gloves which hinder sense of touch.

Confusion: List of instructions and basic tasks participants have to read in the darkened tour room, whilst wearing the visual impairment glasses . Perspective: Users must follow the garbled instructions above and complete basic tasks like half fill and drink a glass of water, hindered by the glasses, gloves and headphones. It gives the user a unique insight into the difficulties faced by dementia sufferers . They are then asked to complete five simple tasks - read the instructions on the wall, pair socks, pour a glass of water, tie a tie and write a note. Its inventors hope the resource will help care professionals increase their understanding of dementia and improve care. Creators say the eight-minute-long disorientating experience will help carers and nurses understand how people with Dementia or Alzheimer’s Disease see the world. The specialist equipment has been tested by patients with stage one dementia to ensure it accurately recreates how they feel during an episode of the condition. Trial: Even a simple task like sorting and folding clothes becomes an ordeal because of the crippling effects of dementia . Sorting this pile of clothes into piles of socks, ties and other garments becomes a disorientating and perhaps upsetting ordeal when hindered by the dementia-simulating equipment . The training company, Training 2 Care Ltd, which brought the course to the UK, called on the Government to make it mandatory for health professionals. Specialist dementia nurse Karen Harrison Dening, from Charity Dementia Care UK, also welcomed the training course. She said: 'The idea that carers would be able to empathise with a person with dementia using this new technology is really interesting. 'It’s so important for anyone delivering care to try and appreciate what it might be like for somebody who is living with dementia. It also uses headphones which play constant background noise and gloves which hinder sense of touch.

Virtual Dementia Tour participant Emma Lowe being briefed by Glenn Knight, 41. Creators say the eight-minute-long disorientating experience will help carers and nurses understand how people with Dementia or Alzheimer's Disease see the world . 'The arts and media have tried for a number of years to describe the experiences that people with dementia may have had and this technology could be another useful adjunct to that. 'I would add that it’s imperative that it’s handled sensitively though, as there are many people who are living positively with dementia.' Glenn Knight, 41, managing director of Training 2 Care Ltd which owns the UK licence of the product, called on David Cameron to give the trial government funding. My experience of having dementia for eight minutes felt like how I imagine being subjected to torture would - isolating, debilitating and extremely distressing. First I was kitted out in all the gear; gloves to stunt my touch, rough textured pads for my shoes to make my feet prickle, orange-dark glasses to impair my vision and headphones. My senses were heightened and I couldn’t hear myself think because of the constant noise which was played in my ears. The most striking thing to me was the sounds of moving traffic which made me jumpy and the sirens which frightened me. I could hear a dripping tap, footsteps and a constant muffle made me unable to concentrate on anything. When I finally stumbled upon the list of instructions for the five tasks - after the initial instruction to find the list was reinforced to me - I found I was unable to read them. The words blurred and the letters danced on the page. I just wanted to know what to do and found it desperately frustrating. The normal processes I would go through on a day to day basis for some reason went out of the window. My healthy brain couldn’t instruct my body to carry out simple and obvious tasks. As a healthy, logical adult I would have turned the light on in the room before the trial started to make it easier, but that didn’t even occur to me. I found myself attempting to pair socks sat in and among a pile of clothes on the floor because my feet prickled and I couldn’t see. Baffling as it may seem, at the time it made more sense to me to throw all the clothes on floor to search for pairs of socks. When asked to clear the table again I popped things on the floor as it seemed logical. I was later told that healthy adults would never dump clothes on the floor. I struggled to make sense of any instruction.I found myself wandering around in the dark, finding things to look at and finding a safe place to sit. I genuinely felt like my grip on reality and normality had gone completely. It deeply upset me that they could switch my brain off that quickly. I walked into the room knowing nothing about dementia and now I feel I have been given a peek-a-boo look to help me understand the daily struggle people face. I have seen in just a few minutes how this disorder takes away your coherent mind and in all honesty it was disturbing. I think if everyone could try the experience it would really challenge their views of the illness and how to care for it. He said: 'David Cameron keeps saying that we need to improve understanding and care provision for people with dementia. 'We want the Prime Minister to let us come to number 10 and put him through the tour.' He added: 'The tour gives you a window into the world of those suffering with dementia. 'It truly is an unusual, emotional and very thought-provoking experience. 'It’s impossible to know exactly what it feels like to have dementia, but the tour brings people closer to what it is like than any other system in existence. 'We want to get this technology out to as many organisations and health professionals as possible. 'We want to see the service provided to all those working in care homes with elderly people suffering from the illness to experience to allow them to understand how it feels. 'The only way to do this is to put the healthy brain in the challenging situation of the dementia brain and see for yourself. 'In the UK if you have cancer everyone understands it, people jump in to support you, help you through it and help you fight it. 'Family members can get their heads around what is happening. 'But dementia isn’t like that, people struggle to cope because they struggle to understand it and sufferers end up closed away on their own, when in reality they need to maintain interaction and instruction. 'Through the trials we have learnt things like the importance of the application of touch - placing a hand on a sufferers arm to show contact will mean they engage with the instructions better.' Conservative MP Priti Patel, who represents Witham, Essex, said: 'I was hugely impressed by the work of Training2Care in bringing the Virtual Dementia Tour to the UK. 'It is an incredibly powerful window into the world of a dementia patient, and will be invaluable in giving carers, family and friends of patients the empathy they need to understand the condition. 'I thoroughly recommend PK Beville’s tour and applaud the work that Training2Care are doing.' The virtual dementia tour was designed by PK Beville, 60, who has been working with dementia patients since 1983 and began researching the tour in 2000. The American based inventor said: 'It is really up to us. As our society grows we need to grow and mature with dementia, and that means we are the ones that have to change. 'The thing about dementia is it is not something that just strikes a person, it strikes a family, the people who care for the family and their children, it affects everyone. 'You can’t be more aware of dementia than actually being given dementia for asmall period of time.' According to the Alzheimer’s Society, there are an estimated 820,000 people in the UK with dementia and only 44 per cent of people with dementia in England, Wales and Northern Ireland receive a diagnosis. While dementia mainly affects older people, there are an estimated 15,000 people in the UK under the age of 65 who have dementia. Former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, 40th President of the United States Ronald Reagan and best selling author Terry Pratchett all suffered from dementia.","Virtual Dementia Tour alters senses and perception to simulate condition .

Saving: Chancellor George Osborne said he was taking action to curb rises in the cost of motoring and catching the train . Fuel duty will not rise before the general election and an inflation-busting rail fare rise has been scrapped in a bid to cut the cost of getting to work. George Osborne found £750million to cancel a 2p-a-litre rise in fuel due next September. And rail fares will rise at 3.1 per cent in the New Year in line with inflation, instead of the 4.1 per cenr commuters were told to prepare for. Mr Osborne said he wanted to help . struggling families in a meaningful way by reducing scrapping all of the . rises which the last government had planned over several years. Mr . Osborne told MPs: ‘Next year’s fuel duty rise will be cancelled. Instead of petrol taxes going up by 2 pence a litre, they will stay . frozen. ‘That means . compared to the previous government’s plans, petrol will be 20 pence a . litre less. That’s £11 less every time you fill up. A saving for drivers . over this Parliament of £680.’ He went on: ‘We’re helping those who drive a car and we’re helping those who get the train too.‘For fares next January were due to go up by 1 per cent above inflation. ‘We are going to keep average fares flat in real terms.’ The fuel duty freeze is one of the key . measures Mr Osborne unveiled to counter Labour’s challenge that the . coalition is failing to act on the cost of living crisis. In addition to scrapping the rise planned for September 2014, the Chancellor also ruled out any further rises before May 2015. Mr Osborne will then have frozen duty for four years in total, at a cost to the Treasury of £22billion. In the last decade the cost of petrol at the pump has risen from 74.6p to 130.25p. Under Labour fuel duty rose from 45.82p per litre in June 2003 to 57.19p by the time of the 2010 election. Scroll down for video . Petrol prices have risen sharply in the last decade, but Chancellor George Osborne said he was determined to hold down fuel duty until the general election in 2015 . Under rises set out by Labour . Chancellor Alistair Darling it peaked at 58.95p in 2011, but Mr Osborne . then cut it to 57.95p, and has now ruled out any further rises. Two . thirds of the cost of petrol is made up of tax, either fuel duty or . VAT. Tax accounts for more of the cost of petrol than in any other EU . country. Mr Osborne . signalled his plan to freeze fuel duty at the Tory party conference in . October, but at the time had not found the money to pay for it. Three in five drivers have cut back on car use because of rising costs, according to the AA. A . Populus survey for the AA showed 45 per cent of people are using their . car less and 28 per cent are slashing family or personal budgets to . compensate. In Wales, 67 per cent of people are spending less or driving less because of fuel costs. Almost half of motorists have cut back on spending or driving as a result of high fuel costs, according to an AA survey . The AA argued that the economic recovery was not being felt by struggling motorists, even at a time when supermarkets are embroiled in a petrol price war. Ahead of the Autumn Statement, AA president Edmund King said: ‘The Government has committed to a fuel duty freeze and is trying to extend the 5p rural fuel duty rebate, which is helpful. ‘However, if the Treasury is going to make concessions to the fuel retail industry, it needs to tie them to fairer pricing. ‘That can be achieved via wholesale price transparency. Despite falls in the average price, inflated prices on some forecourts mean lower sales hence fewer customers.’ Costs: Rail fares will rise by 3.1 per cent in line with inflation, instead of 4.1 per cent, saving passengers £25 a year on average . The January 2014 fare rise for regulated rail fares, which include season tickets, was to have averaged 4.1 per cent. But Mr Osborne said today that the rise would be limited to an average of 3.1 per cent. Mr Osborne announced that his decision would benefit more than 250,000 annual season ticket holders who will, on average in 2014, save £25. For instance, an annual season ticket from Chelmsford to London should be around £35 less in 2014 than it would have been without the change in the price formula, while an annual season ticket from Oxford to London should be around £45 less. However, as announced earlier, train companies will still be allowed to put some regulated fares up by a limit of 2 per cent above the RPI cap (in other words by as much as 5.1 per cent) as long as the average rise is no more than 3.1 per cent.","Coalition has scrapped or frozen every scheduled fuel duty rise since 2010 .

The Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon - along with the battalion of celebrities that stopped in to help him premiere - managed to conquer Monday night's ratings, with a 7.1 rating in the overnight metered-markets. That is equal to an audience of 11.3 million viewers. However the likeable comedian failed to surpass the recent record by by his predecessor, Jay Leno, whose departing show on February 16 managed a mammoth 9.2/22. That totaled 14.64 million viewers overall in the Nielsen nationals, according to Variety. Jolly good show: Jimmy Fallon made a strong debut as the new host of The Tonight Show, with an estimated audience of about nine to 10 million people tuning in on Monday night . Jay Leno, seen here during his August 2013 taping with Barack Obama, totalled 14.64 million viewers overall when his final Tonight show went to air on February 16 . Fallon had a 3.8 rating among young viewers aged 18-49, a number that surpassed ABC, CBS and Fox last week, reports The New York Times. Both Leno and Fallon benefited from a huge lead-in from NBC's coverage of the Sochi Winter Olympics. Fallon still managed to place about 80% higher than the combined overnight Monday rating for the programs hosted by Jimmy Kimmel on ABC and David Letterman on CBS, Variety reported. His debut was also well up on the 5.4/14 metered-market rating that Leno garnered on March 1, 2010, when he returned to fronting the franchise after brief stint by Conan O'Brien. The show featured Will Smith, a rooftop performance by U2 and an interview with Bono, was well as a seemingly never-ending string of celebrity cameos, which included Stephen Colbert, Tina Fey, Robert De Niro, Mariah Carey, Kim Kardashian, Sarah Jessica Parker, Joan Rivers, Seth Rogen, Lindsay Lohan, Mike Tyson and Lady Gaga. U2 perform on the roof of the Rockefeller Center for the debut of The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Monday night . The Irish band took to the roof of the New York studio and first played 70 stories high as the sun set . It also marked the return of The Tonight Show to New York City, where . it originated in 1954. Entertainment Weekly said that Fallon's big test will not necessarily come on his first post-Olympics outing on February, but 'the weeks, months and years to come'. 'It’s a cliche to write that a TV show’s ratings are a marathon not a sprint, but it’s a cliche that’s never more true than when analyzing late-night talk shows,' the TV industry mag said. In reviewing Fallon's debut, EW depicted him as a loveable goof. Will Smith and Jimmy Fallon get 'jiggy with it' on premiere of The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Monday . 'Time-slot rival Jimmy Kimmel is the inheritor of the Letterman tradition: Too cool for school. Fallon is the guy who thinks school is pretty cool,' the review said. Variety reported: 'Tonight has been the No. 1-rated latenight program for most of the time it’s been on the air for NBC, from Jack Paar and Johnny Carson through the two stints of Leno. But with the passing of the baton from Leno to Fallon, both ABC (with Kimmel) and CBS (with Letterman) see an opportunity to gain competitive ground.'","Premieres to a 7.1 rating and 11.3 million viewers .

It . was a second in as many games for the Costa Rican left back deputising . for Leighton Baines, the defender wanted by former Everton boss Moyes, who has already plundered Goodison for his coaching staff and . Fellaini. Little wonder they enjoyed ending the honeymoon. MOYES GETS A SKIPLOAD OF ABUSE . David Moyes said that he expected a 'mixed’ reception from the travelling Everton fans.Well, if by mixed he meant a colourful collection of abusive chants, then we suppose he was right. The tone of their scorn was, fundamentally, that their former boss is full of rubbish, or words to that effect. Wayne Rooney was also flipped a few fiery fingers when he was taking his first corner beneath the blue contingent. WILL BAINES BE BACK SOON? Leighton Baines was present on the Everton bench. Currently sidelined with a broken toe, he isexpected to be out until January. The England left back was the subject of a failed approach fromUnited towards the end of the summer transfer window. There is talk of a renewed bid in the newyear. That being the case, his next outing could well be back here at Old Trafford... MUTUAL RESPECT BETWEEN MOYES AND MARTINEZ . Moyes and Roberto Martinez enjoyed a warm exchange before the game kicked off, but the pair could not have been further apart during the contest. The Scot and Spaniard kept to the extreme edges of their technical zones for the majority of the match and thus avoided any prospect of confrontation. There appears to be a genuine respect between the two Premier League bosses. HERO FOULKES REMEMBERED FONDLY . Respect, too, was the best way to describe the pre-game applause for survivor of the 1958Munich air disaster and 1968 European Cup winner Bill Foulkes, who died last week at the age of 81. Both sets of supporters took to their feet to pay tribute to the former Manchester United centre half who appeared 688 times for the Red Devils.

And following the harrowing . video and images, a professional driver who was at the charity show in . Santa Clarita has come forward to claim that Rodas and Walker took their car out to check for a suspected mechanical issue and not for a joyride as has been claimed. 'As they were backing up the Carrera . to put into the garage, it started stalling. I heard someone say, and I . think it was Roger, ""Why is the car stalling? Let’s take it around the . block"", the unidentified witness told Hollywood Reporter. 'Paul said, ""Let me go with you really quickly"". Tragedy: Fast and the Furious star Paul Walker died in a car crash on Saturday in California . 'The whole premise of taking the car out for a drive was because something was wrong.' The . individual, who has declined to be named, said from his experiences with . Walker and Rodas that the two were not likely to engage in a high-speed race . with the Porsche Carrera GT - a car that is notorious for its handling . issues at speed. 'These . guys are business owners and Paul was a celebrity. They are responsible . people. It was more like, ""What the hell is wrong with this car? Let’s . see what’s wrong and go for a drive"". 'These guys were more like, ""That’s weird, the car is stalling, let’s figure it out"".' The dramatic images from the minutes after the crash show how Walker's friends arrived on the scene and desperately tried to put out the flames with fire extinguishers and reach their friend. However, it is alleged that the situation was so hopeless that one of Walker's friends named Nute was so upset at being held back that he punched a firefighter - but was not charged by Sheriff's afterwards according to TMZ.Com . The 30-second video clip, obtained by OMG! Insider, also appears to show that there were no other cars in front or behind of Walker's Porsche in the seconds before the crash - adding to claims that he was not involved in a high-speed drag race before the incident. Instead, it shows cars eventually rush to the scene as friends and passersby heard about the wreck. While investigators appear to have ruled out racing of any kind as they seek to determine the cause of the crash, video of Fast & Furious star Walker has emerged in which he boasts of driving at 185mph on a freeway. The tragic actor made the boast on the GT Channel in 2011, while he was test-driving a Nissan GT-R in Japan. 'The fastest I've ever gone is 184 to 186,' Walker says on the video as he then reveals his top speed on a legitimate racetrack is actually less. This comes as law enforcement look into the possibility that speed was a factor in Saturday's deadly crash - although it was Rodas and not Walker who was driving the Porsche super-car at the time. In fact the impact from the crash was so fierce that debris from the Porsche destroyed parts of a landscape garden and shattered windows of buildings hundreds of feet away. A property manager for a complex located more than 100ft from the scene told radaronline.com that the crash hit the building where he works. 'Debris flew down the hill into our parking lot,' said Melvin Termain. 'A tree got broken, it messed up a little of the landscaping. 'Debris flew up and hit the window in the furthest unit'.

'There were pieces of the car that flew into the parking lot next to the tree. Also, the front fascia of the building next to the crash was about three stories tall and made of glass,' said the driver to the Hollywood Reporter. 'I looked up and saw the crash broke the window at the top of the building. 'I thought, 'That must have been a sizeable crash.' Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Richard Cohen had told CNN that authorities received a phone call tip on Sunday suggesting that another car was at the scene when the Porsche slammed into a light pole and burst into flames.

High-flying headmistress Anne Lakey, 53, has been charged with eight child sex offences involving one boy aged under 16 . The headmistress of one of the most improved schools in the country has been charged with a string of child sex offences. Anne Lakey, 53, chief executive of the Durham Federation, has been suspended since last December and was yesterday charged with eight allegations relating to a boy aged under 16. The Crown Prosecution Service said Mrs Lakey faces four counts of indecent assault, two counts of gross indecency and two counts of incitement to commit gross indecency, all involving the same boy and said to have taken place between April 1988 and May 1989. The Durham Federation includes Durham . Community Business College (DCBC) and Fyndoune Community College in . Sacriston, County Durham. DCBC became a pioneer of vocational . education, while Fyndoune has been named among the most improved state . secondary schools in the country for each of the last three years. The alleged victim was not a pupil at any school where Lakey, from Stanley, County Durham, has worked. A teacher since 1982, and a member of the National Leaders of Education, a body set up to transform struggling schools, Lakey is a national pioneer in schooling. Last year she was hailed as an example of 'inspiring leadership' by the chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw. Caroline O’Neill, head of education at Durham County Council, said the charges were ‘clearly very concerning’. She added: 'They refer to allegations regarding offences said to have occurred in 1988 and 1989. 'I would like to reassure everyone that we will continue to offer our support to parents, pupils and the school to ensure that the education and wellbeing of young people is not affected.' Governors and senior teachers will be briefed on the news today and pupils will be given letters to take home this evening. Lakey, who was suspended from her position a year ago, was succeeded by Trevor Dunn, a former principal of DCBC.  However he was himself suspended in October, only to be replaced by former head of Fyndoune, Sam Robbins. Durham Community Business College, part of the Durham Federation run by Lakey, specialises in vocational training . Fyndoune Community College (with head Trevor Dunn pictured) has soared up the school league tables . Mrs Robbins, who succeeded Mr Dunn having previously been head of Fyndoune, was also suspended just a few weeks later, leaving pupils' parents angry about being 'kept in the dark' about what was going on behind the school gates. Ms O’Neill said the charges against Lakey were ‘entirely unrelated’ to the suspension of Mr Dunn and Mrs Robbins and the latter two have now returned to their posts at DCBC and Fyndoune. However, the council has refused to say why they had been suspended. David Bell, the school’s chair of governors, said the Federation had continued to deliver high quality education in Lakey’s absence and staff were committed to ensuring the charges against her have no negative impact on any child’s education. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Anne Lakey, 53, is chief executive of the Durham Federation of schools .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:46 EST, 14 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:26 EST, 14 October 2013 . The Queen has been forced to live in 'crumbling' surroundings, with a 60-year-old boiler struggling to heat Buckingham Palace, it was claimed today as it emerged the Royal Estate now requires £50million of repairs. The monarch has seen utility bills soar by 50 per cent in just a year to hit £3.1million. Palace aides were today challenged about why they failed to ‘fix’ energy tariffs as families are urged to do. It also emerged courtiers are planning to scrap the Royal Train when the current carriages are taken out of service within the next 10 years, complaining it is too noisy, uncomfortable and expensive. Inefficient: This picture taken with a thermal imaging camera shows the huge amounts of heat lost from parts of Buckingham Palace. As part of a survey in 2009 the historic palace was found to be the worst energy polluting building in London . Feeling the cold: The heating was turned up in the royal palaces last winter to spare the Queen., Prince Philip and other senior royals from the harsh cold weather . The £1million rise in utility bills was . blamed on the cold winter, with the Queen and other senior royals using . 14 per cent more gas. The Commons spending watchdog was grilling senior officials from Buckingham Palace about the use of public money. It comes after it emerged the Queen is set to receive an inflation-busting 22 per cent ‘pay rise’ over two years. She is now expected to be given £37.9 million in 2014-15 to run her Household and conduct official engagements, up from £31 million in 2012-13. The Royal Train could be axed within a decade, it emerged today. The idea of the monarch having their own dedicated train for long journeys around the UK dates back to 1842. The current Queen's and Duke's saloons came into service in the late 1970s, but aides say they have become increasingly uncomfortable and noisy for the aging royals. Sir Alan Reid, Keeper of the Privy Purse, told MPs that the train would probably only survive another five or 10 years. 'There will come a time when it does not work properly any more but we are not there yet,' he said. Pressed on the bill for a replacement, he suggested the cost would be too high to afford. 'It would be a major investment. I think the numbers would be staggering.' Instead, senior royals could forced to travel more by car to cut costs, MPs were told. However, the monarch is said to be . ‘down to her last £1 million’, leaving her vulnerable to ‘unexpected . costs’, according to a report from the National Audit Office. MPs . on the Public Accounts Committee expressed alarm that the heating . systems were so old that the Queen saw heating bills rocket to keep warm . in the winter. Labour MP Nick Smith said: ‘I was shocked that boilers hadn’t been changed in Buckingham Palace for 60 years.’ Austin Mitchell, another Labour MP, complained that the Queen was living in 'crumbling surroundings'. Around 39 per cent of the Royal estate is below 'target condition', and bringing it back up to standard was likely to cost more than £50 million. There are plans to replace the boiler in the next three to five years, at a cost of up to £1million. In 2012-13 gas use soared by 14 per cent, electricity was up three per cent and waste water increased by nine per cent. Last year the Royal Estate used approximately 24.4 million kWh of gas, up from 21.0 million kWh in 2011-12. The Palace said it was due 'largely to the prolonged period of cold weather in the . final quarter of 2012-13'. Lib Dem MP Ian Swales said: ‘Gas is up 14 per cent. That’s an enormous increase in gas consumption in just one year.’ MPs said the rise did not match rhetoric from aides that there had been a renewed emphasis on going green. Mike Stevens, Deputy Treasurer to Her Majesty The Queen, said: ‘We certainly saw a very significant increase in the final quarter of last year. ‘But this is an area that we will wish to look at ways in which we can reduce. ‘One of the areas in which the Sovereign Grant will be applied will be the replacement of boilers in the man palaces which are nearing the end of their useful life. ‘One of the key projects of the next 15 years will be refurbishment of Buckingham Palace. ‘Heating systems there are antiquated. They are over 60 years old and they don’t lend themselves to efficient use of energy.’ Refurbishment: Many of the grand rooms used to meet foreign signatories, such as the King Tupou VI of Tonga and Queen Nanasipau'u who met the Queen last week, are in need or urgent repair . The Royal Household was accused . by the Public Accounts Committee of giving some of its top earners a 'heck of an increase' while many staff had their pay frozen last year. Committee chairman . Margaret Hodge said: 'Was it really sensible for three out of . the five members of the Lord Chamberlain's committee, all earning over £100,000, to give themselves extra money when they were expecting . staff on £21,000 not to have extra money.' She said it was 'not a very good message' to freeze wages for low earners while increasing pay for managers. Sir Alan Reid, Keeper of the Privy Purse, stressed that his pay of £180,000 was frozen during the last . financial year, as was the salary of the Queen's private secretary Sir . Christopher Geidt, who warns £146,000 a year. Mike Stevens, the Queen's deputy treasurer, told the MPs: 'Underpinning these increases, over the five years since . 2007-08, the household's pay bill has reduced by 6% in real terms.' It is hoped a major overhaul in future will help to ‘drive energy consumption down’. The NAO highlighted what it describes as ‘significant reductions’ in the monarchy’s funding over the last 20 years. It . says that grants for royal travel on official engagements both at home . and abroad has been slashed by 76 per cent in real terms. The maintenance for royal palaces, including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, was similarly reduced by an impressive 60 per cent. That has left, according to the NAO, a huge backlog in property maintenance, with 39 per cent of occupied royal palace being deemed below their ‘target condition’. Mr Stevens added: ‘Like all projects we are having to prioritise and try to eek out the useful life of assets wherever possible. ‘I would expect that we would to looking to replace [Buckingham Palace boilers] within the next three to five years.’ Pressed on the cost of the new boiler, he said it would be in the ‘ballpark of half a million to £1million, in that sort of region’. Sir Alan Reid, Keeper of the Privy Purse,  also defended the way the Royals sourced energy, explaining that while the Household did not 'fix' its bill, it set up multi-year deals to obtain power from the wholesale markets. The Queen’s money men have been dramatically scaling back their spending, reducing net expenditure by 55 per cent in real terms. According to the figures, that led to real-term expenditure of £32.9 million in 2011-2012, compared to £72.6million in 1991-92. In order to help meet the shortfall, the Queen has repeatedly eaten into her savings - known as ‘drawing down on reserves’ - over the years and is, apparently, down to her last £1 million in the bank. The NAO, which scrutinises public spending for Parliament and is independent of government, says this poses serious questions about the palace’s ability to cope in an unexpected crisis if, say, the roof of Buckingham Palace fell down. ‘As part of its long-term planning the Household may need to consider whether the Reserve is adequate to meet unexpected costs,’ it says.","Gas use by the Royal Estate soars by 14% in a year as cold winter bites .

Hope: Abigail Hernandez was in contact with her mother after her disappearance on October 9 according to investigators close to the case of the missing New Hampshire girl . Abigail Hernandez, the New Hampshire teenager missing since October is believed to have contacted her mother after police announced she had disappeared investigators announced today. Hernandez, 15, of North Conway was last seen on October 9 after leaving Kennett High School on her way home, but the FBI now says dramatic new information has come to light that suggests she has been in contact with her mother since that date. Since her disappearance, Hernandez's parents have made repeated public pleas for her safe return - even stating in a televised interview that they believe she got in a car with someone and that they believe she is in serious trouble. While the investigation into Abigail Hernandez's disappearance seems to have drastically changed, the nature of the contact and how it was conducted have not been released by law enforcement. Indeed, the FBI said at a press conference today that they discovered evidence of the contact between Abigail and her mother two weeks ago and that it dates from after her October 9 disappearance. Federal investigators did not elaborate on what this means for Zenya Hernandez, her mother, or Abigail and more details are expected at a press conference on Friday at 11am. 'We don't know that she is well or safe by any means,' said FBI special agent Kieran Ramsey. 'In fact, we have grave concerns for her safety.' Scroll down for video . Revelations: It has been revealed that Zenya Hernandez has been in contact with her daughter since her disappearance on October 9 - despite her previous statements . Incentive: The FBI is offering a $20,000 reward for information in the missing person case . All-American girl: Abby ran track at school and was described as quiet and bright . The girl’s mother said last month that she believes her daughter will come home someday. Zenya Hernandez urged her daughter to be strong. Police have said they don’t know whether Abigail was involved in an accident, ran away or was abducted. 'I miss you and love you more than you can imagine,' Zenya Hernandez said in her note written on a yellow legal pad and dated November 22.  'I feel your absence every day. You belong home with me.' In her letter, the missing girl’s mother said she believed Abby was alive, and she expressed hoped that her daughter would find a way to reach out to her. ‘Abby, you are a strong young woman and I am staying strong for you,’ Zenya Hernandez wrote. ‘You are courageous, you are smart, and you are beautiful.’ New Hampshire Assistant Attorney General Jane Young said investigators are still working the case and that it is important to keep Abby's picture in the media -- especially outside of the local area. ‘Abby, I keep having a dream where you come home and I give you the biggest hug ever,’ she wrote in her letter. ‘I know in my heart this dream means something and that it matters. I pray to God it will come true.’ The letter was signed, ' Love, Mom,' with a little heart drawn on the page. Zenya Hernandez held a press conference in November at the Conway police station in New Hampshire where she pleaded for her daughter's safe return . During a press conference held last month in front of the Conway Police Department, Miss Hernandez addressed her daughter, saying she believed Abby was out there somewhere watching her right now. In an interview with CBS Boston, Miss Hernandez said Abby usually took the bus home, but for some reason decided to walk October 9. State and Conway police and the FBI have been inundated with hundreds of tips. The FBI is offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in the case, Boston.com reported. The last call made on a missing New Hampshire girl’s cellphone was October 9 about four hours after she was last seen, investigators said. Police, FBI, New Hampshire Fish and Game personnel and volunteers have all helped to search for the teenager but have not found any leads . Sniffer dog teams, police helicopters, and FBI fixed-wing planes have been drafted in as police reveal they have been sent 200 leads from as far away as Texas . The last sighting of the girl, who ran on the track team for her school and was described as quiet and bright, was around 2.30pm. Investigators believe Abigail made it back to her home, but when her mother came back from her nursing job, her daughter was gone. The schoolgirl's 15th birthday was on October 12. Police said they have not located the girl’s phone, but have determined that the last call was made at 6.30pm - about four hours after her last sighting. It was used about two miles from her home at a spot near Cranmore Mountain - a popular local ski resort. Since then local police and the FBI have searched on foot, in boats, and by helicopter but have failed to turn up any new evidence about the disappearance. Abigail is 5ft 4in tall and weighs 118lb with brown hair and eyes. She was last seen wearing black stretch pants, tall brown boots and a grey sweater. Anyone with information is asked to contact Conway police on 603-356-5715.","Abigail Hernandez, 15, disappeared October 9 in Conway, New Hampshire .

Roy and Glenys Smith, both in their early 90s, were discovered at the foot of the apartment building in Bournemouth, Dorset, where they were housebound. It is believed that they told neighbours of concerns about being put a home the night before their bodies were found by an assistant caretaker at Crag Head, a seafront apartment building. The previous evening the frail couple, both in their early 90s and said to be housebound, said they did not want to have to go into a care home. Death: Roy and Glenys Smith, who are in their 90s, were found dead outside this block of flats in Bournemouth . The couple, who are thought to have two sons, lived on the second floor of the building and are thought to have fallen around 30ft to their deaths. An ambulance crew rushed to the apartment block but the pair were pronounced dead at the scene and police are not treating the deaths as suspicious. Neighbour Mark Goldfinger, 83, said: . 'They were an elderly married couple who suffered from poor health in . recent years. He lost his eyesight altogether about two years ago. 'It . must have happened some time during the night because nobody in the . flats saw or heard anything. Someone realised what had happened when . they looked outside at about 8am. 'Their . bodies had been covered up and then the police and ambulance arrived, . taped off the area and took them away. It is very sad. Tragedy: The elderly couple are believed to have killed themselves to avoid having to live in a care home . 'They lived on the second floor but it wasn't an accident. They were elderly people and it would have been an effort to climb over the railings of the balcony. 'In the last five years they came out less and less as their health worsened. The husband always held on to his wife when they were out walking.' Another neighbour, Ruth Burger, said: 'I didn't know them very well but I knew them enough to say hello to. They were very devoted to each other - they held hands everywhere they went. 'They were both very elderly and I don't think they were very well. What happened is tragic. Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'I can't believe it - I'm very upset. Housebound: The Smiths were often seen walking around holding hands, but were suffering from ill health . 'The night previously they had spoken about not wanting to go to a home. The next thing anyone knew their bodies were lying on the grass outside the building. It's very distressing.' Vivian Phillips, who is on the building's board of management, said: 'They have been living here for a long time - quite a few years. 'Up until last summer, you would see them together going for a walk. But recently, very unfortunately, they were more or less housebound. It is very sad indeed.' A police spokesman said: 'Dorset Police were called at around 8.30am on Tuesday 3 December 2013 to a report of a man and a woman aged in their eighties and nineties having been found deceased outside a block of flats along Manor Road in Bournemouth.

Miss Venezuela, Ivian Lunasol Sarcos Colmenares, beat contestants from 113 countries to the coveted title after impressing the judges in the categories of beach beauty, top model, talent, sports, and beauty with a purpose - where the contestants must demonstrate involvement in a charity project. Ms Sarcos Colmenares, 21, one of 13 siblings, was orphaned at eight and spent five years studying at a nunnery. She dreamed of becoming a nun but her life took a different direction, as she gained a degree in human resources and worked for a broadcasting company before becoming a beauty queen. Miss World 2011: Miss Venezula, Ivian Lunasol Sarcos Colmenares, has taken the coveted title .

This was the 60th year of the beauty pageant . and to celebrate its diamond anniversary, it returned to the city where . it all began. The first was held in London in 1951 during the Festival . of Britain on the South Bank of the River Thames. But throughout its 60 year history, the beauty competition has attracted critics as well as fans. This year was no different and campaign groups, including London Feminist Network, Object and UK Feminista, voiced their opposition to the 'sexist contest'.

'Bring . placards, banners and raise your voice against this appalling offence . against women's equality. Let them know loud and clear that this event . has no place in London in 2011.' But Miss England director Angie Beasley disagreed with their sentiments and said the contest 'had changed with the times' because it was no longer just about looking good in swimwear. She said: 'There is a talent, sports and Beauty With A Purpose round, which is the fundraising round, in the contest and the girls love taking part. 'Yes they have to look great to win but it's so much more than a beauty contest. These people should give it a chance instead of thinking it's just a bikini parade.

'I'm all for women standing up for what they believe in which is why I run Miss England but I'm fed up of these protesters trying to bully us and push us around. 'We live in a free society where women have the right to choose. The contestants in Miss World are quite capable of making up their own minds if they want to enter or not and protesters shouldn't keep criticising the same decision. If you don't like it, don't watch it.' Nice to see you...: Bruce Forsyth and his wife, former Miss World 1975, Wilnelia Merced, appeared on stage . The message that the competition is now about brains as well as beauty was shown by figures that revealed out of this year's contestants, more than half are studying for a degree, . one in four are graduates and more than half speak at least three . languages. The contest was also revealed to have the support of Nelson Mandela. He sent a message which was read out during the final sending his greetings to all the contestants and congratulating them on their efforts for charities. TV presenter Bruce Forsyth also took to the stage with his wife, Wilnelia Merced, who was crowned Miss World in 1975, while dance group Diversity and boyband Blue performed for the worldwide audience.

The lesbian waitress who claimed that she was left a bigoted note may have lied again as a charity has still not received a donation that she announced she was making. Dayna Morales kicked up a firestorm after telling a gay advocacy group that she was left a homophobic note by a family that she waited on who  instead of a tip. The family later said she was making it up, but that hasn't stopped 22-year-old Morales from collecting tips from other customers who were eager to make up for what they believed was a real insult. Some good, finally: Dayna Morales has begun refunding well-wishers who donated around $3,000 to her after hearing her outrageous tale . She later said that she would donate the 'replacement tips' that she had received since the ordeal to the Wounded Warrior Project, a charity that helps injured soldiers. Now the charity has told the local Patch site in Bridgewater, New Jersey that they have not been able to find any donations from anyone in the area near her home address- meaning that they would be able to find it whether or not she used her name or remained anonymous. The only other way that the donation could have been made without it being searchable is through an unidentified third party or in a different zip code. She first announced that the donation- the amount of which remained undisclosed- was going to Wounded Warriors because of her own personal military service as a Marine, but that has also been called into question. Upset: Dayna Morales, pictured left while a . marine and right, said she was offended and hurt by how the couple, with . two small children, treated her while she served them but the family denied her claims . While Morales did serve in the Marines Corps reserve from July 2009 to May 2013, thereâ€™s no indication in her record of any combat service in Afghanistan or Iraq. The donation issue is just the latest in a string of lies that have been unearthed, as MailOnline previously interviewed one of Morales' friends who told a number of the 22-year-old's other tall tales. Kiersten Lynn Bremer, 23, from Washingtonville, New York, said she met Morales in November 2011 when she got engaged to one of her best friends, Teresa Rivera. Proof? The controversial receipt (left) shows exactly the same price, time and date of the meal as the family's copy (right) - but does not have the $18 tip the family swear they left bringing the total to $111.55 . 'We hit it off from the start and I never had such a good a connection from a girl ever. My husband and I left her stay the night at our house so many times.' 'But then things started coming up - she started saying things about how she was once pregnant and the baby died. She claimed she was blown up in her tank in Afghanistan. She said everybody else in the platoon were killed - so there were no other witnesses.

"By . Matt Chorley . and James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 05:40 EST, 17 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:53 EST, 18 October 2013 . Pregnant: Equalities minister Jo Swinson is due to give birth on Christmas Day . It is seen as one of the cradles of democracy. But as one mother-to-be found out, the House of Commons is no hotbed of chivalry . Yet while the incident led to a stream of protests on Twitter and was condemned by some Tory MPs who had been sitting at the other end of the chamber, Miss Swinson could not see what the fuss was about. David Cameron made clear that giving up a seat for a pregnant woman was the 'decent thing' to do. But Miss Swinson believes it was ‘quite sexist’ to suggest she was not capable of standing. The incident reignited the debate about whether people should offer their seat to pregnant women, and whether expectant mothers should assume they would. Miss Swinson champions women’s rights in government and has called for a change in attitudes to new parents. But onlookers were alarmed to see the 33-year-old standing during throughout PMQs yesterday, while Labour, Tory and Lib Dem  backbenchers sat nearby. As David Cameron took questions in the Commons at midday every seat was taken, leaving a large group of MPs standing by the main doors. Miss Swinson, who is due to give birth on Christmas Day, was among them. But none of the MPs sitting just feet away offered her a seat – to the surprise of Westminster observers. James Forsyth, political editor of The Spectator, wrote on Twitter: ‘Quite remarkable that no MP has offered Jo Swinson, who is seven months pregnant, a seat. 'Really shocking lack of manners and decency.’ However aides to Miss Swinson claimed the idea that she was not capable of standing was 'sexist'. A source close to the minister said: ‘The suggestion somehow that people should be outraged on her behalf is ridiculous. The idea that just because she is seven months pregnant she has lost all ability to stand on her two feet or fend for herself is quite sexist. 'She did not think it was an issue. If she had wanted to sit down she would have asked to sit. She is quite capable of fulfilling her functions as a minister – including standing and walking – while she is pregnant. She is not somehow severely incapacitated.’ However Mr Cameron's official spokesman insisted the Prime Minister thought anyone should give up their seat for a pregnant woman. 'Take the example of public transport . - I think if you see someone who is in greater need of a seat than . yourself I think offering that seat is a good thing to do... a decent thing to do,' the . spokesman said. Asked if Mr Cameron would offer his seat to a pregnant woman if he was on a bus, the spokesman said: 'I'm sure he would.' Pressed on whether that would be a . sexist thing to do, the spokesman said: 'Offering one's seat to someone . who is in greater need than oneself on public transport? I think that's a . very understandable thing to do.' Standing room only: None of the MPs who had secured a seat for Prime Minister's Questions gave up their place for Miss Swinson (circled) The issue of whether to offer up a seat to a pregnant woman has become increasingly vexed. In one camp are those that argue expectant mothers are more likely to be tired - they are carrying around another person after all - and will appreciate the option of sitting down. But critics say the idea that a pregnant woman cannot stand up on a train or a bus is sexist and patronising. Last year mother-to-be Meenakshi Minnis hit out at 'barbaric' passengers on a packed Manchester tram who refused to give up their tram seat - even though she is eight months' pregnant and needs crutches to walk. When Kate Middleton, five months pregnant, was presented with a 'Baby On Board' in March last year she joked she would 'wear it at home'. The source close to Miss Swinson said the minister did not . want to ‘give a running commentary’ on whether she had been offered or . accepted seats in other circumstances, such as on public transport. ‘Sometimes . she’s in the middle of a carriage surrounded by people who are also . standing so other passengers may not see her,’ the source added. ‘She . does not necessarily feel aggrieved about that.’ Miss Swinson is a junior business minister working with Vince Cable, and has pushed for greater equality for women at work. She . has admitted the pressure of carrying a baby was taking its toll on . being a minister in the government and Lib Dem MP for East . Dunbartonshire. However the source resented the idea that Miss Swinson has been made to like 'some sort of victim'. 'She arrived ten minutes late for PMQs, and that’s why she was standing right at the back,’ the source said. ‘She . wasn’t visible to the majority of MPs who had their backs to her. She . also knew she had to leave early because she had another event to go to. ‘She . was standing talking to a colleague, and she was perfectly happy . standing. She was perfectly happy being where she was and did not feel . the need to have a seat. If she needed to have a seat, or had felt she . wanted to have one, she would have been perfectly capable of asking. Once tipped as a future Scottish . Secretary, she admitted she will not be able to lead the charge in next . year’s independent referendum. ‘Clearly, . there will be a period when I won’t be able to be quite as active on . the doorsteps,’ she told the Independent on Sunday last month. ‘But, . yes, I want to be strongly involved in that campaign because I believe . it’s so important for the future of Scotland and, indeed, for the future . of the UK.’ She is also adamant that she will not take ministerial red boxes while on maternity leave. ‘I am still very committed and enjoy my job and want to come back to continue doing that, but I think having a bit of time to do that early bonding is also really important.’ Government: Miss Swinson is a close ally of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and has been tipped for the Cabinet . The coalition has agreed new rules . allowing new parents work alternate months for up to a year under moves . to tear up ‘old-fashioned and rigid’ workplace rules. Mums . and dads will be able to ‘mix and match’ how they look after a newborn . baby for their first year. They will be able to take up a total of 52 . weeks in joint leave, either taking it in turns or at the same time. Ministers hope the changes will encourage fathers to play a bigger role in raising their child while mothers are able to return to work at a time of their choosing. Miss Swinson said she had discussed with her husband Duncan Hames, who is also a Lib Dem MP, about how to ‘share the parenting as much as possible’. She added: ‘Like most new parents, we are both very excited about our new arrival and wanting to be very hands-on from the start.’","Equalities minister left without a seat during 30-minute Commons session .

A brave 13-year-old girl who was the sole survivor of a rock slide which killed her parents, sister and two cousins said today that she will never forget her father's bravery when he sacrificed his life to save her. Gracie Johnson suffered a broken leg but survived when 100 tons of boulders came loose from a mountain and tumbled onto a hiking trail near Buena Vista, Colorado on September 30. Miss Johnson said on Thursday that she was doing 'really good' and spoke proudly of her dad Dwayne whom she credits with saving her life. She told Today: 'I did cover myself, but I was just standing in the open. He did push me to a rock that was bigger than I was, and he just saved me.' Scroll down for video . Finding the courage to carry on: Gracie Johnson, 13, pictured today, was the sole survivor of a rock slide in Colorado which killed her mom, dad, sister and two cousins . She added: 'I'm doing really well, and I'm healing a lot. It's a lot different. Nothing is going to be the same for me. I'm handling it really well. I know that I have to change a lot.' Gracie's mother and father Dwayne and Dawna Johnson, ages 46 and 45, were killed, along with her 18-year-old sister Kiowa Raine Johnson and cousins Baigen Walker, 10, and Paris Walkup, 22, from Birch Tree, Missouri. Her brother Dakota, 20, was not on the hike and was her only immediate family member to survive the tragedy. Gracie spoke to presenter Savannah Guthrie along with her aunt Dayna, uncle Daryle and cousin Tyler who have moved from their home to live with Gracie in her tight-knit small town of Buena Vista. Tragic: This picture from the Chaffee County Times shows the Johnson family, which was devastated by the rock slide. Daughter Kiowa, 18, (left); mother Dawana, 45, (second from left) and father Dwayne, 47, (right) were killed. Gracie, 13, (second from right) was rescued. Dakota, 20, (seated) was not with the family at the time . Friends said 'everybody' in town knew the family. Dawna and Dwayne once owned a restaurant in town. Dakota was a star football player before he graduated last year . Gracie Johnson spoke on the Today show on Thursday alongside her aunt, uncle and cousin who have moved to her small town of Buena Vista, Colorado to live with her . Gracie said she wanted to . thank everyone in the town for how much they have come together to help . her deal with the devastating loss. Her uncle Daryle told Today that the kindness and support had been extended to them. Mr Johnson said: 'You don't know how many times you hear, ''Anything we can do for you, just give us a call.'' 'It's a great . community. It's a little bit of a change going to a small town, but it . is really nice.' His wife Dayna added that her brother-in-law 'didn't know a stranger' and that Donna 'was one of the most beautiful souls'. The Johnson family played a big part . in town life. Dwayne was an assistant football coach at Buena Vista High . School, as well as an electrician and landscaper. Dawn coached track at the high school, was a photographer and a popular waitress at a restaurant in town. 'Everyone knows this family. Everyone who was involved in football knew Dwayne,' Brian Dengler, the . pastor at Cornerstone Church, said at the time of the tragedy. Trapped: Five hikers were killed after being buried under the 100 tons of rock which slid down a mountain in Colorado in September . 'The whole family, they were gregarious. Very outgoing. Very active in the community. Kiowa just turned 18. Dwayne was so proud of his girl. Just an amazing, amazing family.' The rock slide happened at Agnes Vaille Falls near Mount Princeton - . 130 miles southwest of Denver. The short mile-and-a-half trail is popular with families and is known as one of the easiest hikes around. The Johnson family took advantage of a clear, beautiful day Monday - following days of rain and clouds previously - to take their visiting family members Baigen and Paris for a hike. Chaffee County Sheriff's Deputy Nick . Tolsma was among the first officials to respond to the scene of the . collapse, where he discovered Gracie alive under a rock. 'I heard a scream next to me. I saw a hand sticking out underneath the boulder,' Tolsma told ABC News. 'The . true hero is her dad. She said her dad jumped on her to protect her at . the last moment when the rocks were coming down. I think he saved her . life.' Geologists believe that the downpour of rain that the area received recently, combined with the onset of frost - which froze and thawed the ground, likely caused the massive rock slide - which loosened boulders the size of cars and let loose an estimate 100 tons of rubble.

Four years ago Mrs knill took a course in theology and it was during one of the group sessions that she finally revealed she was sent to the concentration camp when she was 20. In a moving testament she describes the realisation that she faced being gassed like six million others. Scroll down for video . Traumatising: Iby Knill, pictured after Auschwitz was liberated and as a Leeds grandmother today, has fulfilled a promise she made to a dying girl to tell the world about the horrors of the death camps. It took almost 70 years . Survivor: Iby Knill, now 90, is the subject of a documentary. She said: 'The girl told me that her and her sister were going to be experimented on. She said they were then going to be gassed and therefore exterminated' She explains in a new documentary that . during a session on her course a group at Leeds University, in the city where she now lives, they were discussing whether the Holocaust was a result of evil or sin. The tutor said that 'only a person who was there could answer that question'. Mrs Knill responded simply with 'I was there'. For . Mrs Knill it was like the floodgates had been opened and, fulfilling . her promise to the unknown girl, she decided to write her memoirs. Remembering . her terrible first night at Auschwitz, she said: 'The girl told me that . her and her sister were going to be experimented on. 'She . said they were then going to be gassed and therefore exterminated. She . made me promise to tell the story of the camps, if I were to live.

Death camps: Iby Knill was at Auschwitz, which comprised two separate camps, for six weeks . Instrument of death: One of the surviving gas chambers at the Auschwitz concentration camps . The Auschwitz death camps played host to some of the most gruesome Nazi medical experiments, which few survived. Professor Carl Clauberg oversaw the mass sterilisation of hundreds of Jewish prisoners by putting chemicals in their fallopian tubes and exposing their genitals to X-rays. The procedures were brutal, often causing infections and radiation burns. Some ‘patients’ were used for human medical trials of the drugs Rutenol and Periston, reacting with bloody vomiting and painful diarrhoea. Other experiments had no apparent purpose and were done merely for practice - or pleasure. Doctors deliberately made the lungs of tuberculosis patients collapse and killed others by injecting lethal phenol into their hearts. One of the most infamous doctors, Josef Mengele (above right) infected different races with contagious diseases to see how their survival rates compared. Source: Auschwitz.org . She said: 'There, you were . one of a number, and it came down to how long you could survive.' After the camps were liberated, she was too traumatised to tell her story but has finally broken her silence. Mrs . Knill, who went on to marry British Army major Herbert Knill, was born . in Czechoslovakia but escaped to Hungary in 1942 when the SS began . rounding up Jews. Two years later, when Mrs Knill was 20, Hungary was occupied and she was . transported to Auschwitz where she spent six weeks before being . transferred to the German labour camp Kaunitz, which was eventually liberated. Mrs Knill later moved to Britain where she had two children, Christopher . Knill, a psychiatrist, 65, and Pauline Kilch, 58, a teacher. A . film was made out of Iby's memoirs, The Woman Without a Number, by film and television student Robin Pepper, 22, at Teesside . University. He and fellow . students Mark Oxley, 26, from Darlington, and Ian Orwin, 22, from . Sunderland, made the documentary for a final year project after he read . her book in just one day.

A bitter - and somewhat superstitious - ex has posted a Craigslist ad in Pennsylvania for a pretty diamond engagement ring with one small flaw: it used to belong to 'Satan herself.' Along with a 1.5 carat diamond ring in a white gold setting, buyers should be aware when purchasing, writes the poster, that they also risk biblical plagues and a broken heart. The poster concludes that if he is not successful in selling the ring by Christmas, he plans to throw the ring 'into the fires of Mordor.' Not forever: The owner of this ring is hoping to be rid of it forever by Christmas to prevent it visiting any more disasters on him . The ring is for sale with a price tag of $1,800, which the poster writes is significantly less than he paid for it from Littman's. Purchase of the ring must be made at your own risk though, warns the the seller, documenting a trail of destruction left in its wake. 'Possible events associated with this ring include but are not limited to: damage sustained to house, vehicle, heart, downed powerlines, fallen trees, and swarms of locus [sic],' reads the ad. It is unclear whether the ring or 'Satan herself' was responsible for these catastrophes, but the poster recommends covering your bases. 'I would highly recommend taking action to counter the whirlwind of bad mojo that surround this piece of jewelry,' he writes, suggesting a voodoo priest may be able to exorcise the 'curse.' Bad luck: The seller claims the pretty ring is responsible for destruction and heartbreak - a unique selling point . It seems the ring is the product of a broken engagement, as the woman to whom it belonged only wore it for 'a short period of time.' The white gold and diamond ring with diamonds along the sides and a lower setting 'so the diamonds won't snag on everything' comes in its original box. The ad was placed last week and is still active - so if Satan herself having been a previous owner is not a problem, buyers should nab it before Christmas when it will meet a fiery fate. For sale I have a 1.5ct total weight engagement ring set in 14K white gold. The ring is in like new condition, only worn for a short period of time by Satan herself. Comes with the original box. Very pretty ring with a lower setting so the diamonds won't snag on everything. Diamonds along the sides and in the channel setting show off light from all sides.

Now, it seems it requires quite the opposite. The new WAGs are not the Wives and Girlfriends of footballers, but the Women Ageing Gracefully – and without a false eyelash in sight. The best examples of this elegant breed include Helen Mirren and Joanna Lumley, according to a poll. Age gracefully: Women think that it's time to start aging gracefully at Cyndi Lauper's age of 59 and voted Helen Mirren the most gracefully aged . It found that, for most women, 59 is the age when they have a radical rethink about their style. But many also believe that some things . should be ditched decades earlier. The  survey of 2,000 women over 45 . found that most believe heavy make-up, mini-skirts and glitter become . unacceptable once a woman hits 40. A third said that women of that age should avoid false eyelashes, and 40 per cent said that lots of blusher was not a good look. Doing it well: Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley were also in the top five women who age gracefully . Leather trousers and mini-skirts . should be binned at the age of  41, the respondents insisted, while 43 . is apparently the time to  ditch the heavy eyeliner and set aside the . fake tan. More than half of those polled said women over 50 could not . get away with tattoos. Bleached hair is also not flattering for the . over-50s, according to a third of those questioned, while 45 is the age . to put away those tight tops. In fact, the only product which stood . the test of time was red lipstick, which the participants agreed was a . timeless classic that can be worn at any age. Ungraceful: Madonna and Anne Robinson were at the bottom of the poll when it came to who aged the most gracefully . Time to give it up: Jennifer Lopez, 43, and Christie Brinkley, 58, have passed the age when women believe it's acceptable to wear leather trousers and mini skirts . 1.    Helen Mirren . 2.    Judi Dench . 3.    Joanna Lumley . 4.    Twiggy . 5.    Nigella Lawson . 6.    Lorraine Kelly . 7.    Honour Blackman . 8.    Lulu . 9.    Fern Britton . 10.  The Duchess of Cornwall . The poll found that women believed . dressing appropriately was the best way of growing old gracefully – but . they weren’t the only ones. A resounding three-quarters of men also said . that certain looks were ageing on women and confessed that they were . put off by those who try too hard. Alongside Miss Mirren, 67, and Miss . Lumley, 66, Dame Judi Dench, 78, and Twiggy, 63, topped the list of . celebrity women who embrace their age with style, while Madonna, 54, and . Anne Robinson, 68, were named as examples of those who are failing to . grow old gracefully. Nearly a third of the women polled . feared ending up in the same position, confessing that they worried that . they were too old to wear certain items in their wardrobe. However, 74 per cent said they would . avoid cosmetic surgery in favour of a more natural regime. The poll . found that most women believe a good diet and a strict skincare regime . were key to looking youthful. And a confident 59 per cent said they . think they look younger than they actually are and don’t need the latest . trends in fashion and make-up to look good. A spokesman for Nurture Replenish . Skincare, which commissioned the survey, said: ‘Many women will be able . to relate to these findings.

John Lewis has launched an appeal to find the five-year-old girl who wrote them a letter saying sorry for breaking a bauble. Known only as Faith, the girl sent a handwritten apology to her local store after she said she accidentally broke the decoration on a visit to the shop. Faith even attached two pound coins to the note, apologising for the damage she caused at the Cambridge branch of the department store. Adorable: A child, known only as Faith, accidentally knocked a baubel decoration to the ground in Cambridge on Saturday - and wrote a letter to say sorry, attaching two pound coins with a piece of Sellotape . The letter arrived there after being posted to the ‘Christmas Department’ soon after her visit. In the note, Faith said: ‘To John Lewis Cambridge, I am sorry I broke a Christmas bauble on Saturday. ‘It cost two pounds, here is the money. Sorry again, Faith. Aged 5.’ Staff at John Lewis are  touched by the gesture but also baffled as to who the young girl could be. Store boss Dominic Joyce said: ‘The letter arrived on Tuesday afternoon and had no return address or indication of who the young girl was. We really want to find out who she is so we can thank her. ‘She visited us on one of our busiest weekends of the year and we still are unsure as to which bauble was broken. ‘We’d like to thank her and because of her adorable letter maybe give her something from the store she would like.’ Mr Joyce also took to Twitter in an attempt to use social media to find out who the little girl is.

Researchers in Ohio have found a revolutionary way to let amputees feel what they're touching with prosthetic hands. The team from Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Case Western Reserve University has created a means of letting users feel more sensations, better, and with more sustained results than ever before. While others have hade lukewarm success at connecting nerves with electrodes, this team's special technique has created remarkable results. Scroll down for video... Common problem: Test subject Igor Spetic demonstrates his inability to pluck the stem from a cherry without crushing it when the sensors in his hand are turned off . Messy issue: Without sensation, Spetic is unable to determine the softness or size of an object . The breakthrough can be mostly attributed to a tiny, 7 millimeter connection called a cuff electrode. Placed in a user's body and connected to nerve bundles through the arm stump, the electrodes convey sensations from sensors on a prosthetic hand or fingers. The sense of touch is felt from 20 different spots on the hand, another feat on the part of its developers. What's more, the results have been found to last past 18 months whereas other such trials have ended with degraded sensation in the nerves. 'It’s real exciting to see what they . are doing, and I hope it can help other people,' Spetic says. “I know . that science takes a long time. If I don’t get something to take home, . but the next person does, it’s all to the better.” Neuroscience . professor at Northwester University Lee Miller told MIT Technology . Review just how exciting these results really are. Revolutionary: With the sensation on, Spetic is able to actually feel the cherry and control his grip accordingly . New technique: The remarkable results are thanks to a new technique of connecting electrodes to bundles of nerves in the arm . 'This is the greatest number of distinct touch sensations generated by peripheral nerve stimulation that I know of, and the 18-month-long stability is also unsurpassed,' Miller said. Two people have thus far been fitted with the device, including Madison, Ohio man Igor Spetic. Spetic is the subject of videos made by the researchers that first show him attempting to take the stem from a cherry while the sensation is turned off in his hand. As would often be the case for many prostetic hand users, he's unsable to complete the take without crushing the cherry. With the hand turned on, it's a different story. Spetic is able to remove the stem, leaving the cherry intact. 'It’s real exciting to see what they are doing, and I hope it can help other people,' Spetic said.

Plaintiff: Tom Christmas (pictured) and his wife sued ExxonMobil accusing the gas and oil giant of letting . alligators run wild near their property . A lawsuit filed by a Mississippi couple accusing ExxonMobil of causing an alligator infestation on their property has now reached the state's high court. The Mississippi Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments today in an ongoing legal dispute between Tom Christmas, of Wilkinson County, and the Texas-based oil and gas giant. The lawsuit involves more than 80 alligators that Christmas and his wife argue they didn't discover on land next to their Wilkinson County homestead until four years after they bought the property in southwest Mississippi. The Christmases bought 35 acres between Centreville and Woodville in December 2003. The land had previously been used for hunting and timber and was not occupied when they bought it. Court records do not show from whom they bought the land, but it was not owned by ExxonMobil. The property was originally operated by Rogers Rental and Landfill Company Inc. The property has 19 rainwater retention ponds, totaling about 85 surface acres of water. Scroll down for video . Homestead: The Christmases bought 35 acres between Centreville and Woodville in December 2003 to raise horses . Gator country: This property owned by ExxonMobil has 19 rainwater retention ponds, which the plaintiffs claim are teeming with alligators . Alligators were allegedly introduced to the site from Louisiana as ‘canaries’ to warn of hazardous contamination in the retention ponds. Exactly who put the reptiles there is a matter of dispute. ExxonMobil has owned the facility since July 2001, but it had a close relationship with Rogers that stretched back to at least 1980. At some point in the 1990s, Rogers stopped accepting new refinery waste, and the facility has since been maintained as a former waste disposal site. ExxonMobil said the Christmases' real estate agent told the couple about the alligators as far back as 2003. The energy giant also claimed that the Christmases waited too long to file a lawsuit saying the alligators robbed them of enjoyment of their land and that the statute of limitations has passed. ExxonMobil appealed a state Court of Appeals ruling in May that returned the case to Wilkinson County for trial. The Christmases argue the alligator infestation of the ExxonMobil property is a non-abatable nuisance that has caused a permanent injury to their property. They are seeking damages for permanent depreciation of their land, not an abatement of the nuisance or damages for the temporary loss of use or enjoyment of the property. Scaly canaries: The amphibians were allegedly introduced to the site from Louisiana to warn of hazardous contamination in the retention ponds . Timeline dispute: ExxonMobil said the Christmases' real estate agent told the couple about the alligators as far back as 2003 . Out of bounds: The oil and gas company erected . fences to hold back the predators, but local residents say the animals . are capable of digging under the barriers . The Christmases sued Exxon in August 2008, seeking damages for permanent depreciation of their land. Circuit Judge Lillie Sanders threw out the lawsuit in 2011. ExxonMobil attorneys said the Christmases should have investigated the alligator issue when they first saw one in 2003. The corporation argues its hands are tied when it comes to the alligators because they are protected and regulated by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. In a brief, the MDWFP said that under state law only it can decide whether an alligator is a nuisance and only its officers can take steps to move or otherwise deal with them. ExxonMobil said it cannot be held liable for legally protected wild alligators that allegedly roamed from their property onto the Christmases' adjoining property. In court documents, the MDWFP said in 2007 it was called upon to address the alleged ‘infestation’ of wild alligators. The department said it counted about 84 alligators on the ExxonMobil land. MDWFP officials said not all may have been counted. At ExxonMobil's request, MDWFP said it removed seven adult alligators from the property in July 2008. Defense: ExxonMobil said it cannot be held liable for legally protected wild alligators that allegedly roamed from their site onto the Christmases' adjoining property . MDWFP attorneys said the Christmases were not satisfied with what wildlife officers did and sued ExxonMobil. Attorneys representing the Christmases argue that determining whether the alligators are a nuisance is an issue for a jury. They said the Christmases discovered the alligators when they moved to the property in 2007 and Tom Christmas was allowed on the ExxonMobil property to search for a lost hunting dog.

Plain Vanilla CEO Thor Fridriksson’s QuizUp is a runaway success that has overtaken the Apple App Store’s games charts and has over 3.5million registered users only three weeks since being released. Brainchild: The App has been developed by Plain Vanilla CEO Thor Fridriksson, pictured . QuizUp is a trivia game modeled after TrivialPursuit that allows people to compete in specific categories against friends or anyone else around the world. Mr Fridriksson detailed his creative process to New York Magazine. The most important key to any app is . to build on an existing idea, the San Francisco-based executive said, explaining that games . such as Words With Friends and Draw Something took an offline game and . made it addictive. QuizUp’s success comes from its simplicity. Mr Fridriksson designed the game to be simple and intuitive, but also familiar. ‘Having . gameplay that’s familiar to you is a huge advantage, because you can . get right into the game,’ he explained. ‘We don’t have an onboarding . mechanism. You just start.’ Once . gamers have opened the app they can just select a category and begin . answering questions. There are no gimmicks like other games commonly . have, just trivia. ‘You get . to a level, it’s addicting, but in order to continue you need to share . it or ask your friends for help,’ the Iceland native said about smash . success Candy Crush Saga. Scroll down for video . Exclusivity: The app is currently only available on iPhones, which Mr Fridriksson believes has contributed to its success . ‘We are trying to do the exact opposite,’ he explained. ‘We don’t really reward people at all for sharing.’ If the game's success has been simple and sudden, Fridriksson's rise to fame has not been. Rather than some overnight success, the tech entrepreneur studied at Oxford University before working his way up through various leading telecommunication firms. And selling his trivia plan wasn't a walk in the park either. 'It… wasn’t easy,' he told techcrunch. 'I thought I’d just charm my way in front of these VCs, share my big idea for a quiz platform, and they’d throw money my way. Not quite.' 'Just connecting with the right people was a challenge. I’d cold call and ask for meetings, and they’d maybe be willing to set something up for 2, 3 months later. I had to be creative to get in front of these VCs. It maybe even bordered on stalking. In hindsight, maybe it was a bit creepy.' Since it's launch on November 7 QuizUP has signed more than 1.5 million users playing more than 70 million games - quickly dominating Apple's download charts. Players soon start ramping up . experience points (XP) and begin ranking in their city or state in . specific categories and post those achievements online. Those postings are what has led to the game’s remarkable organic growth. ‘Most . of the new players are coming through Facebook and Twitter shares,’ Mr . Fridriksson explained. ‘They’re proud of being No. 1 in their state in . botany, or something.’ Beautiful simplicity: THe game is easy to use and intuitive . The latest mobile app mastermind also learned a lesson from other successful apps, don’t fragment. Developers are not releasing multiple . versions of the game, they have instead provided users the ability to . upload their own questions to the game from within the app. There are over 200,000 currently in the app, but that number grows daily. Comparison: Players can compare their performance against friends and others . ‘You have to be able to constantly refresh content,’ said Mr Fridriksson. Having the app only on iPhones has also made it successful, according to the executive. ‘It's made it a kind of status symbol,’ he said. ‘If there’s one person in a school or university who gets the game, there are twenty the next day, and the next day, everyone who has an iPhone has it.' An android version is coming next month, New York Magazine noted. The firm with just 30 employees now has $1.2million in venture funding and have made the gamble to drop all their other projects to purely focus on Quizup. 'We’ve evolved from being a game studio that has multiple titles into . just being QuizUp,' he told the magazine although admitting he knows . trends can be fickle. 'It’s every man’s dream to have a hit product. Enjoy the ride.' The game also doesn’t try to force players to open their wallets to generate income like many other games do, it instead partners with brands for sponsored categories. The final piece to the success puzzle was making it a quasi-social network. Each category has its own message board that users can have discussions about various topics on. Mr Fridriksson readily admitted to the magazine that some of the discussions are ‘just noise’ but also said topics like physics have ‘really intellectual discussions.’","QuizUp was modeled after TrivialPursuit .

A women admitted to a Chicago hospital in June following an alcohol binge is suing after a doctor took photos of her without her consent and posted them online. Elena Chernyakova, 23, is claiming invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress in a $1.5million lawsuit filed against Dr. Vinaya Puppala, the Feinberg School of Medicine and the Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The incident took place when she was admitted to the hospital earlier this year after becoming intoxicated, she called the doctor for moral support because he was a family friend, she told WLS. This ends here: Elena Chernyakova is taking a stand so this type of behavior does not affect other women . Ms Chernyakova was taken to the hospital after overindulging in alcohol, she was unconscious for about eight hours. It was during this time that Mr Pappala reportedly snapped embarrassing pictures of her and posted them online with humiliating hashtags including 'Cuvee #bottle #service #gone #bad,' her lawsuit claims. About . 15 minutes after she regained consciousness, Mr Puppala, who knew Ms Chernyakova through a mutual friend and was called to the hospital to keep her company, visited her . hospital room before gaining access to her medical records . 'I've never been in a situation like that, so I just wanted someone there for moral support,' she told the station. He then returned several . hours later to take photographs of her ‘while she was on the hospital . bed, crying and attached to an IV,’ according to the complaint. Mr Puppala . was seen by hospital security in the hospital taking the pictures and . was asked to delete them immediately. 'The security guard asked him to delete these pictures, which he said he will. But obviously, found out he never deleted them,' she continued. He knew her previously: Elena Chernyakova, left, claims Dr. Vinaya Puppala, right, took photos of her while she was recovering from an alcohol binge at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago . Instead he posted the photographs on Facebook and Instagram, along with ‘attached statements of commentary’ about her condition, according to the complaint. The complaint alleges that Ms Chernyakova never agreed to be photographed, and was not even in a condition to provide her consent. The hospital and Feinberg Medical School ‘substantially assisted’ Puppala in allowing this to happen, according to the complaint. According to her website, Ms Chernyakova is an actress, model, and ex-professional tennis player from Moscow, Russia. She started acting in July 2012 after . graduating from Northwestern University with a degree in Communication . Studies, Business, and International Studies. She has appeared in . several films and TV shows, including Superhero Me, Psychotic and . Chicagolicious. Multi-talented: Ms Chernyakova is an actress, model and ex-professional tennis player, according to her website . Hospital hell: Ms Chernyakova was mocked while she was supposed to be getting better . According to her complaint, Ms Chernyakova has the ‘potential to someday work for Fortune 500 companies, which may now not occur because of said photographs.’ The Northwestern Memorial Hospital is investigating the allegations and has said it will cooperate with authorities, but emphasized that Puppala was acting ‘entirely on his own.’ ‘Any invasion of privacy at the hands of our trusted health personnel or extended care team of training fellows is unacceptable and not indicative of the Patients' First culture of Northwestern Memorial Hospital, which has zero tolerance for exploitation of private health information, including photography,’ the hospital said in a statement to ABCNews. Mr Puppala is a fellow in the Multidisciplinary Pain Medicine Fellowship at Feinberg, Michigan, which works in conjunction with Northwestern Memorial Hospital, according to court documents. Ms Chernyakova told WLS she filed the lawsuit to draw a line in the sand and make sure this never happens to anyone else again.

Ten stalkers have been sent to court every week since tough new laws were introduced to make it easier for victims to get justice. The government created a specific criminal offence of stalking to take action against people who lives make their victims’ lives a misery. New figures reveal that in a little over a year more than 560 cases have been sent to court, but campaigners warned too few police, prosecutors and judges had been trained to deal with difficult cases. In the first 13 months of the new stalking laws being on the statute book, 566 cases went to court, new figures show . Plans to create a new criminal offence were first set out in 2011, because suspects were having to be prosecuted under other offences, frequently harassment or breach of the peace. Almost 40 per cent of stalking incidents in 2009-10 involved a partner or former partner; a third involved a stranger. Half of cases involved being sent unwanted letters, emails, text messages or cards that were either obscene or threatening. The Protection of Freedoms Act created two new offences of stalking which came into force in November 2012 and by the end of last year had seen 566 cases go to court. It included 422 charged with stalking . without fear/alarm/distress, 41 accused of stalking involving fear of . violence and 103 suspected of stalking involving serious alarm/distress. It means on average 10 cases have gone to court every week since the new laws were passed. Home Secretary Theresa May condemned stalking as a 'sickening and cowardly crime' Home Secretary Theresa May changed the law after research suggested 120,000 offences were committed every year. She said stalking is a ‘sickening and cowardly’ crime. Those who harass others by following or spying on them can be jailed for up to six months. And those who cause their target to fear violence or make them change the way they live can be imprisoned for up to five years. Professor Carsten Maple, Trustee Protection Against Stalking and co-director of the National Centre for Cyberstalking Research, said: ‘Clearly we are delighted that there appears to be significant increase in the number of cases of stalking being taken through the justice system. ‘The fact that there are 10 stalkers taken to court every week shows that victims are coming forward and being taken seriously. ‘We have worked hard with others to bring in these new laws and are glad to see they are being used. ‘We do hope however that these charges are at the appropriate level and the full power of the legislation is being used rather than perpetrators facing lesser charges.’ Criminal justice expert Harry Fletcher, a former assistant general secretary of the probation officers union Napo, said: ‘It is an encouraging start that the law is being used but it is a small proportion of all reported incidents and shows that there is still a very urgent need for training for the police, crown prosecutors and the judiciary. ‘Nevertheless it is a start and one that we can build on.’ When the new offences became law, Mrs May highlighted the case of Rana Faruqui, a 35-year-old business analyst and prominent horsewoman who was stalked by a former boyfriend. Stephen Griffiths followed and spied on her, and cut the brake pipes of her car. Thames Valley police took no action, until Miss Faruqui was stabbed to death in a field in 2003. Griffiths was later sentenced to life for murder, and Miss Faruqui’s mother Carol became a campaigner for tougher laws on stalking. When the new stalking offences became law, the government highlighted the case of Rana Faruqui (right) who was stalked by former boyfriend Stephen Griffiths but police took no action until she was stabbed to death in a field in 2003 . Releasing the figures on cases sent to court, Solicitor general Oliver Heald said: ‘The records held by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS identify the number of offences in which a prosecution commenced and reached a first hearing in magistrates courts, rather than the number of defendants prosecuted or the outcome of proceedings. ‘A single defendant may be prosecuted for multiple offences.’ Last year Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, the Association of Chief Police Officers' national policing lead on stalking and harassment, admitted officers had not ‘made as much progress as we'd like to’ on dealing with the issue.","New offence created in 2012 means stalkers face up to five years in jail .

Parents should not let their baby share their bed because it increases the risk of sudden infant death, experts have warned. Health officials in Sweden are so worried about the practice that they have issued new guidance to highlight the dangers. Bed-sharing between parents and infants is widespread in the country - but this can put newborns at risk. Parents should not let their baby share their bed because it increases the risk of sudden infant death . 'It's important that children under three months sleep in their own beds,' said Kerstin Nordstrand, of the National Board of Health and Welfare. She said the recommendation was 'new', since the institution had previously only advised against new-borns sleeping in the same room as a smoker, or in the same bed as a parent under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The information was first published by Swedish medical newspaper Dagens Medicin, which cited a paediatrics professor at Gothenburg University. 'It has been clear in the research in recent years that co-sleeping is a risk factor in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS),' Professor Goeran Wennergren told the paper. A 2001 study published in the paediatric journal Early Human Development showed that 65 per cent of three-month-old Swedish babies slept with their parents, the highest rate in the Western world. A report published by the British Medical Journal, which analysed nearly 1,500 sudden infant deaths, revealed that 22 per cent took place while the baby slept in the parental bed. The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare says it is vital that babies sleep in their own bed until they are at least three months old . According to professor of medical statistics Bob Carpenter, who was responsible for the study, the risk of sudden infant death among babies sleeping with their parents is five times higher than in those who sleep alone. Other countries, including France and the U.S., recommend sleeping in the same room as the new-born, but not in the same bed. SIDS is the unexpected, sudden death of a child under the age of one in which an autopsy does not show an explainable cause of death. It is also known as cot death. Almost all SIDS deaths occur without warning or symptoms when the infant is thought to be sleeping. Some recommendations to prevent SIDS include putting the baby to sleep on its back, with enough space to move, avoiding exposure to tobacco smoke and making sure they are not too hot.","The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare says babies under three months old should always sleep in their own bed to reduce cot death risk .
Previously the board only said babies should not share a room with a smoker and that they should not share a bed with a drunk parent .

Miss G, whose identity has been kept secret by a judge, says she may be crippled with a metal knee, but knows how to look after herself and doesn't want the state interfering in her life . A frail spinster of 94 has asked a High Court judge to stop her local council interfering in her life and leave her in peace at her £350,000 home. A two-day hearing was told social workers and police were sent to her house 12 times in nine months to investigate if her private live-in carers looked after her properly. The case was brought by the council which believes her decisions are unduly influenced by the carers, a married couple. They may now be removed from her home. Social workers asked the judge to decide if the spinster had mental capacity to decide on her financial affairs and living arrangements. But the pensioner, a retired NHS midwife identified only as Miss G, told the judge: ‘I am a grown woman. I know who I want to live in my home and who I choose to stay there with me. ‘I am crippled with a metal knee but I can manage my own affairs. Nobody tells me what to do. I don’t want these people from the council persecuting us. It is malicious interference in my business. Referring to her carers, identified as Mr and Mrs C, she added: ‘We are a family together and we want to live in peace.’ The hearing was made open to the Press after Miss G gave the judge a signed statement asking for ‘the names of myself and the council which has brought these legal proceedings made public. ‘I would also like it known that my express wish is to remain in my own home, with my current 24-hour carers, and without social services intrusion.’ Miss G asked to hire her own independent lawyer, but the court decided she should be represented by the Official Solicitor (a state-appointed lawyer) whom she met only a few minutes before the hearing began. During the case in London, Miss G was made to sit on a wooden bench through nearly nine hours of evidence by lawyers and medical experts at a cost to the public purse of thousands of pounds. On four occasions, Miss G put up her hand to get the attention of the judge and stated in a clear soft voice that she did not want the council interfering in her life and was happy with her private carers. Judge Mrs Justice Russell ordered that the identity of Miss G, her carers, the council and the medical experts should remain secret for the time being. This is despite a ruling last month by Sir James Munby, the top family court judge, that councils applying to remove children into care or take control of the lives of the old and sick can no longer hide behind a cloak of anonymity. Sitting at the High Court in London, Judge Mr Justice Russell ordered the woman's identity and that of her carers to remain secret despite Miss G signing a form waiving her anonymity . Expert witnesses and social workers should, he said, be named in public. The landmark change breaks a silence that has surrounded family justice for a quarter of a century and follows a campaign against the secrecy in family courts by the Daily Mail. After the hearing, Miss G told the Mail: ‘I do not want to be silenced about how council social workers have treated me. 'I invited this couple to live with me as family 18 months ago. We come from the same part of the Caribbean and the female carer and I are distant relatives. 'The council began to make false accusations against the two of them and interfered in my life.’ She added: ‘I was frightened when the social workers and police kept bursting into my home. ‘The council carers from an agency cut short my visits and did not shower me very often in two years. ‘There were rats in my house and everything smelt. I was in a bad state when I invited the private carers to live with me instead.’ Barbara Hewson, barrister for Mrs C, said the council’s care agency team had eaten Miss G’s food and left the fridge empty so there was nothing for her. She said the council had put ‘intense pressure’ on Miss G, adding: ‘The level of state intrusion has been oppressive.’ Miss G used to be an NHS nurse and has her own savings and a pension to live off of (file picture) And she added that Miss G called Mrs C her ‘niece’, which gave a sense of the esteem in which she held her. The court heard that Miss G owned her own house on the outskirts of London and has an NHS pension and savings. Three medical experts gave evidence on Miss G’s mental capacity. One, a psychologist hired by Miss G, said she had told him her female carer was ‘like a daughter’ to her. Miss G had said: ‘She does everything for me, gardening, cooking, combing my hair, looking after me. She is very caring. We have some quarrels from time to time, like any family. I trust her because she is honest.’ The psychologist added she had completed many of the mental tests ‘satisfactorily’, although she might need some help in the future to monitor her financial affairs. Mrs Justice Russell said it was important to make sure Miss G was ‘not suffering from undue pressure from anyone’, adding: ‘The difficulty is that questions have been raised about the care she receives. The court has a duty to protect her.’ She reserved judgment and will give a preliminary ruling next week on whether Miss G has mental capacity to decide her own affairs.

Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old girl who underwent a double lung transplant after her family petitioned to get her on the adult donor list, has finally awoken from her medically-induced coma. Sarah underwent surgery on June 12 and had been recovering ever since. A family representative announced today that Sarah was awake and communicative. Tracy Simon said Sarah had been awake since Friday and was able to answer yes or no questions by nodding. Awake: Sarah Murnaghan, bottom, is awake after she underwent a second surgery on June 21 . Progress: Sarah's parents say she has now recovered enough to be taken off oxygen, though she still gets support from a machine that helps her to breathe . According to Simon, Sarah's family are excited to see their daughter doing so well, but reports that Sarah is frustrated because a tube is keeping her form speaking. Sarah suffers from cystic fibrosis, a disease which was killing her up until the transplant last week. Doctors had only given her a few weeks to live without new lungs. Since she was too young to be put on the adult donor list, she faced certain death since child donations are rare. She is making rapid progress. Two days . earlier she was taken off of a heavy-duty breathing machine and is now . using a traditional ventilator. Doing well: Ten-year-old Sarah Murnaghan is taking steps in the right direction after she underwent a double lung transplant, her mother Janet (right) said on Facebook . Sarah's plight sparked a national . debate over organ transplant policies, which until now barred children . younger than 12 from the adult waiting list. On June 12, Sarah's mother said that a set of lungs had become available for her daughter. 'God is great! He moved the mountain! Sarah got THE CALL,' a statement posted on her Facebook page read. 'Please pray for Sarah's donor, her HERO, who has given her the . gift of life.' That afternoon, Sarah's mother spoke to a reporter from Fox 29 . about her daughter's searching, describing the family as being nervous . but  'excited' about the surgery because doctors had given her child . about a week to live, and they were out of options. In this May 30, 2013 file photo provided by the Murnaghan family, Sarah Murnaghan, center, celebrates the 100th day of her stay in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with her father, Fran, left, and mother, Janet . 'We're just so thankful for the donor,' Ruddock Murnaghan said, adding that while it is a great day for her, it is not lost on her that it is a tragic day for the donor's family, who had lost a loved one. The Murnaghans scored a . major victory on June 6 when a judge ordered the Organ Procurement and . Transplantation Network to add the 10-year-old to the list for adult . lungs. On surgery day, Mrs Murnaghan said . that had it not been for the judge's recent ruling, they would not have . gotten this set of lungs, which likely came from an adult or teenager. 'Sarah would've been number 400 or something on the list,' she said. The Organ Procurement and . Transplantation Network added the 10-year-old to the list on Wednesday night after . U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson's original ruling on June 5th.. The . ruling applied only to Sarah, who has end-stage cystic fibrosis and has . been awaiting a transplant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. An expert has questioned the decision on medical and ethical grounds. Lung . transplants are the most difficult of organ transplants, and children . fare worse than adults, which is one reason for the existing policy, . said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone . Medical Center. Fears: Janet and Fran Murnaghan criticized the regulations that kept Sarah from getting an adult lung . He called it troubling, and perhaps precedent-setting, for a judge to overrule that medical judgment, and predicted a run to the courthouse by patients who don't like their place on the waiting list. 'I'm not sure I want judges or congressmen or bureaucrats trying to decide what to do with organs at the bedside,' Caplan said. The Murnaghans said pediatric lungs are rarely donated, so they believe older children should have equal access to adult donations. Holding on: Before the transplant last on June 12, doctors said Sarah had just a week left to live . Support: Sarah, who has been living in hospital since February, is pictured with her three younger siblings . Nationwide, about 1,700 people are on the waiting list for a lung transplant, including 31 children under age 11, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.","Sarah Murnaghan was given only a few weeks to live without a lung transplant .

Victim: Susan Cox, 46, suffered spinal injuries after being hit by a 55lb sack of rice dropped by a prisoner . A prison cook is set to receive more than £100,000 in compensation from the taxpayer after an inmate dropped a bag of rice on her back. Catering manager Susan Cox, 46, suffered spinal injuries after being hit by a 55lb sack of rice that was accidentally dropped by an unnamed inmate at Swansea Prison in September 2007. The mother-of-one, from Ammanford in Carmarthenshire, sued the Ministry of Justice for a six-figure sum for failing to keep her safe at work, and now seems set to receive a heavy payout after a top judge ruled prison bosses were ultimately responsible for her injuries. Prison officials claimed the accident was not their fault, blaming the 'disobedient and foolish' inmate for dropping the bag of rice. But Lord Justice McCombe has now ruled that staff were ultimately responsible as the inmate was paid to work in the prison kitchens - even if it was only £11.55 a month. The judge said: 'The Ministry of Justice took the benefit of this work and I can see no reason why it should not take its burden.' 'The work was clearly done on the Ministry's behalf and for its benefit,' he added. Mrs Cox had worked at Category B Swansea Prison, which houses 400 prisoners, for more than 10 years when she was injured following a series of blunders. A court heard how she was supervising a team of six prisoners as they carried food from a delivery van to the jail's first floor kitchen. One inmate was trapped in a lift while another managed to spill a sack of rice all over the floor. Mrs Cook ordered the inmates to stop working while she helped clean up the mess. But she felt a heavy thud on her upper back when a prisoner accidentally dropped the bag on her. Lord McCombe said: 'What had happened was another prisoner ignored her instructions to stop work and had attempted to carry two sacks past her as she knelt.' 'But he lost his balance and hit his head on an adjacent wall, one of the sacks he was carrying then fell off his shoulder onto her back,' he added. Mrs Cox suffered agonising spinal pain after the accident which left her unable to work. She subsequently started a claim against the Ministry of Justice for 'very large' damages after being forced to stop working. To blame: Lord Justice McCombe has ruled that staff at Swansea Prison were ultimately responsible for Mrs Cook's injuries as the inmate who dropped the bag of rice was being paid to work in the prison kitchens . Her barrister Robert O'Leary said: 'The ministry should pay for the prisoner's negligence.' 'Its relationship to him was materially similar to that of employer and employee', he added. He also told Swansea County Court that prison bosses had failed to ensure the inmate was trained in manual handling. The county court judge rejected her claim and said the accident happened because of the inmate's own negligent actions. But Mrs Cox appealed against the ruling and won her case. Lord McCombe, sitting with Lord Justice Beatson and Lady Justice Sharp at the Court of Appeal, backed her claim for compensation. They ruled that because the prison service paid the inmate for his work they were 'vicariously liable' for his actions in the same way as any other prison employee. Mrs Cox is now entitled to full compensation for her injuries and the exact amount of her award will be decided at a later date. She declined to comment after the case.","Susan Cook, 46, had to give up working at Swansea Prison after accident .

Paedophile, murderer, pen pal? Teenage girls have been writing to notorious child rapist Marc Dutroux asking to be pen pals . In one letter addressed to Dutroux, the teenage writer said she believes the prisoner is an ‘honest’ man. ‘Hello, I’m a 15-year-old girl. I live in La Roche-en-Ardenne. You have always fascinated me. You’re a famous person. When I see your handsome photos, I can’t help but believe you are honest,’ the girl wrote before the letter was confiscated by prison officials. ‘Would you like to correspond with me? If you want, I can send my picture.’ The teenagers sending Dutroux letters now weren’t even born when his infamous rapes and murders traumatised Belgium in 1996. Child psychiatrist Jean-Yves Hayez said Dutroux appeared to be a ‘victim of the system’ in the eyes of an ‘immature adolescent’. ‘They are rubbing shoulders with the forbidden, with danger, likening their behaviour to that of adults,’ he said. ‘They aren’t aware of the risk they are running.’ Abducted: Laetitia Delhez (left) was was found alive two days after going missing in 1996, aged 14, along with severely emaciated Sabine Dardenne (right), then 12, in the basement of his house the Charleroi suburb of Marcinelle . Terror: Dutroux tied his young victims to a bed on the underground dungeon in which he held them beneath his home in the Charleroi suburb of Marcinelle . Dutroux sent a letter to the father of one of his victims last month, repeating his claim his former wife Michelle Martin and accomplices were largely responsible for his crimes. His ex-wife was also convicted after found guilty of helping him hold the girls captive and playing a role in the killing of two who were found starved to death in a locked cellar. She was freed on parole in 2012 after serving 16 of her 30-year sentence in prison. Dutroux is also seeking early release, but is almost certain to be rejected when he fronts the parole board later this year.","Belgian teens want to be pen pals with convicted paedophile and child killer .

Ceri Leigh, 50, suffers from post-traumatic stress after paramedics arrived 17 minutes late to treat her dislocated knee . A former boss at the Natural History Museum has won a six-figure payout after paramedics arrived late to treat her severely injured knee. Ceri Leigh, 50, developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after dislocating her knee on the bus home from work in 2008. Paramedics were 17 minutes late in reaching her. Mrs Leigh argued that the extreme pain she was in and the length of the wait meant she developed the condition which left her suffering flashbacks, nightmares, a high level of anxiety and depression, and seizures. Today a Judge sitting at London's High Court awarded her £522,379 after she was forced to retire from her job as exhibitions organiser at the museum. Mrs Leigh said spent a total of 50 minutes trapped between seats on the bus Near Wimbledon station in extreme pain. Fellow passengers tried to help and had to hold her down in order to stop her moving. Mrs Leigh said she could not sit or stand and was screaming in agony. Every additional minute added to the trauma of her experience until she felt 'utter despair'. Mrs Leigh said she felt trapped, was shaking violently, became unable to hold her mind together, remembered 'no longer knowing who she was' and went 'into a freeze'. Eventually paramedics arrived, treated her with painkiller and manipulated the leg back into place, but by then the long-term damage was done. She did not recover full function in the knee for about 18 months and became housebound. Mrs Leigh was forced to take medical retirement from the job she loved in 2011 after she began to suffer from dissociative seizures, which cause her body to go numb and collapse. She appeared at the High Court via webcam to save her the trauma of travelling from her new home in South Wales, but the stress was enough to cause a seizure during cross-examination. Mrs Leigh suffered the dislocated knee after getting on a bus near Wimbledon station. As a result of her delayed treatment she developed PTSD which meant she had to quit her job after suffering seizures . The judge said: 'She has continuing PTSD which flashbacks, nightmares and dissociative seizures. 'In the flashbacks, she finds herself back on the bus experiencing the pain and anxiety she felt at the time. 'The nightmares occur nightly, breaking her sleep pattern and leaving her exhausted. 'The dissociative seizures unexpectedly cause her body to go numb and she collapses. She suffers a collapse most days. 'She remains conscious but feels nothing and is unable to move or speak. 'She is unable to travel outside on her own. She is largely housebound. When she goes outside with a family member, she may suddenly collapse in the street. 'She find it difficult to concentrate, plan and action ordinary activities such as housework and mentally tends to go round and round in circles. She becomes easily overwhelmed.' While the ambulance service agreed that paramedics had been late to arrive at the scene, they disputed that the trauma of having to wait caused the PTSD, and disagreed over the level of compensation. Their lawyers said that, during 2010 and 2011, she had other stresses including problems with marital communications, worry about whether her husband would be made redundant, financial problems, her son’s trans-gender issues, her daughter’s issues about her adoption and the pressures of litigation. Mrs Leigh worked at the Natural History Museum until her seizures forced her to take medical retirement . The judge disagreed and said that the delay made a 'material contribution' to the development of her PTSD. He added: 'There are innumerable variables in the circumstances that will give rise to the development of such a disorder and in the people who are likely to suffer it. 'It is impossible to predict on any scientific or mathematical basis the moment after which someone will go on to suffer it.' He said he was satisfied that the seizures were all part of the PTSD and consequent upon it and were not related to other stresses in her life. The judge said he had no hesitation in accepting that Mrs Leigh’s injury was severe as all aspects of her life were badly affected and additional therapy was expected to make only a minimal improvement.","Ceri Leigh, 50, organised exhibitions for the Natural History Museum .

Pensioners should be handed a stamp duty tax break to persuade them to downsize and make room for younger families, experts said last night. Hundreds of thousands of older people are living in family-sized homes which are far too big for their needs and are often too expensive for them to heat. But many are deterred from moving into smaller accommodation because of the prohibitive costs of stamp duty, which can add up to thousands of pounds. It means that large homes are being under-used which would be perfect for younger families waiting to get on the housing ladder. Spacious: The move could help free up larger properties for large families. File picture . Manageable: Many older people are deterred from moving into smaller accommodation because of the prohibitive costs of stamp duty  File picture . The Chartered Institute of Housing is calling for stamp duty to be removed altogether when older homeowners in receipt of pension credit downsize to smaller properties. They say this would allow the country to ‘make optimum use’ of available housing stock. The idea is contained in a submission to Chancellor George Osborne in advance of the Budget next month. The CIH’s chief executive, Grainia (correct) Long, said: ‘When older people on lower incomes want to move from a home that has become too big and expensive for their needs, stamp duty can stand in their way. ‘Removing stamp duty when older home owners who receive pension credit move to smaller properties would make downsizing more affordable and would also free up bigger homes for larger families.’ The Chartered Institute of Housing is calling for stamp duty to be removed altogether when older homeowners in receipt of pension credit downsize to smaller properties . In its submission, the CIH said the Chancellor could also use the Budget to tackle the housing crisis by taking steps to help councils build an extra 75,000 new homes, increase standards and choice in the private rented sector, and increase the rate at which homes sold under Right To Buy are replaced. They called on Mr Osborne to allow councils to borrow more so they can build new homes. Increasing local authority borrowing caps by £7billion would allow them to build 75,000 new homes over five years, creating 23,500 jobs and creating £5.6billion of economic activity. The institute said the Treasury could look at new ways of improving standards in the private rented sector by targeting tax allowances. Private landlords currently benefit from around £7billion of tax allowances per year for deductible expenses such as repairs and maintenance, insurance and professional fees, but these allowances do not target or incentivise higher standards. If landlords who committed to a higher level of standards benefited from an enhanced allowance, while those who did not saw their allowances stay the same or even reduce, government could incentivise higher standards without the need for additional resourcing. Mr Osborne should also amend Right to Buy rules to increase the rate at which replacement homes are built, they said. Current rules on the money generated from Right To Buy sales mean that local authorities are often left with insufficient funds to finance the building of replacement homes. Changing the rules would ensure that councils always have enough money available to fund replacement homes while at the same time meeting the government’s target that receipts should fund no more than 30 per cent of the cost of each new home. Ms Long said: ‘We need to build 250,000 homes a year to keep up with our growing population, but we’ve been failing to reach that target for decades - the result is a housing crisis in which millions of people are being denied access to a decent home at a price they can afford. The Budget offers the government a chance to address this and at the same time harness housing’s potential to boost economic growth.’ She added: ‘With more and more people living in the private rented sector - including more older people and more families with children - it’s vital that we look carefully at new ways to raise standards. ‘We are concerned that the government’s claim that it can provide one new affordable home for each one sold through Right to Buy will not prove to be the case. Truly affordable housing is already at a premium - amending the rules could help increase the rate at which replacement homes are built.’","Costs can mount up to thousands, deterring older people from moving .

Dr Martin Weale, a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, signalled rates could rise by next spring . Households should prepare for interest rates to rise early next year, a senior official at the Bank of England declared last night. Dr Martin Weale, who sits on the powerful committee which sets rates at the central bank, said borrowing costs are likely to increase in spring 2015. But he added that the first rate hike since July 2007 could come even sooner than that in a stark warning to borrowers that the era of ultra-cheap home loans is coming to an end. The explosive comments - the most . explicit signal yet of when rates will rise - raised the prospect of a . hike before the General Election in May 2015. Analyst said guidance on interest rates ‘does not get much more specific than that’. It . marked a dramatic change of tack for the Bank which has in the past . refused to comment on when it plans to raise or cut interest rates. Governor . Mark Carney last week hinted that rates could rise next year - but his . comments were far more measured than those by Dr Weale yesterday. The . prospect of higher borrowing costs will alarm millions of households . who have benefited from cheap mortgages since rates were slashed to an . all-time low of 0.5 per cent in March 2009. But . Dr Weale also suggested that the benefits for savers will be limited . with rates only expected to rise slowly and stay well below the 5 per . cent average seen before the financial crisis. ‘I . think it is very helpful if we try and explain that the most likely . path for interest rates is that the first rise will come perhaps in the . spring of next year,’ said Dr Weale. ‘And then the path is likely to be . relatively gradual.’ He added: ‘I couldn’t rule out the need for a rate rise coming earlier.’ Howard Archer, chief UK economist at . IHS Global Insight, said: ‘You don’t get much more specific forward . guidance than that. Martin Weale has certainly delivered.’ Dr . Weale, a highly respected economist who has sat on the Bank’s monetary . policy committee since 2010, said the timing of the General Election . would have little impact on the decision. ‘During an election campaign it would obviously be difficult but the election campaign will last for three weeks,’ he said. The . Bank has already moved the day it sets interest rates in May 2015 from . the seventh - the day voters go to the polls - to the 15th so as not to . clash with the election. A rate rise before polling day could spook millions of borrowers worried about their mortgage costs. But . it would be welcomed by savers who have been hammered by low returns . since the financial crisis struck and rates were cut to emergency lows. Chris . Williamson, chief economist at research group Markit, said: ‘If the . economy is judged resilient enough to absorb a rate hike then it’s . something to celebrate.’ George . Osborne has said that the discussion around the possibility of higher . interest rates ‘is a mark of success’ because it shows ‘we have started . to see the recovery take off’. It marked a dramatic change of tack for the Bank which has in the past refused to comment on when it plans to raise or cut interest rates . The Bank last week raised its growth forecasts for the UK economy for this year from 2.8 per cent to 3.4 per cent. Economic growth has not been stronger since 2003. Mr Carney hailed Britain as ‘one of the strongest economies in the advanced world’ as he predicted robust growth, tumbling unemployment and low inflation in the coming years. Mortgage lender Nationwide estimates that around one million people have got on to the property ladder for the first in the past five years. Many will have stretched their budget to the limit in order to get on to the ladder - but will now have to find a way to increase their repayments. Graham Beale, chief executive of Nationwide, has raised fears over ‘a whole generation of borrowers how have never experienced increases in their monthly mortgage payments’. Mr Carney has insisted that any rate rises will be ‘gradual’ and ‘limited’. He raised the prospect of rates only rising to 2 per cent by early 2017 and staying at between 2 per cent and 3 per cent until around 2020. The Canadian, who succeeded Lord King as Governor in July last year, said the MPC will not return rates to the 5 per cent average seen before the financial crisis any time soon.","Borrowers told to prepare for an interest rate rise in spring 2015 .

The young husband of a self-confessed Satanic serial killer has said in a jailhouse interview that he's still enamored by his teenage bride despite her claim to have murdered more than 22 people. Elytte Barbour told CNN from Columbia County Prison in Pennsylvania that the news hasn't changed the way he feels about Miranda Barbour, 19. 'I still love her,' Barbour said over a secure telephone line from the jail where he's awaiting trial for allegedly luring a man through Craigslist, strangling and stabbing him 20 times with his love, three weeks after they were married. Still in love: Elyette Barbour, pictured, told CNN from Columbia County Prison in Pennsylvania Wednesday that the news hasn't changed the way he feels about Miranda Barbour, 19 . Speaking to CNN Wednesday, 22-year-old Barbour acknowledged, 'Everyone wants to know about her credibility but wouldn't comment on whether her confessions were valid. However, he said she was upfront with him in 'about 50/50' of the alleged slayings, with respect to specific names of victims and the locations of the murders. He insisted he'd been cooperating with police so far, adding 'It seems like I have my life or death on the line right now.' The interview comes after his father-in-law Sonny Dean said he would support his daughter's execution if she is found guilty and even hold the hand of the victim's widow as she'd killed. Dean said he believes his teenage daughter may have been involved in one other murder besides the . November 11 fatal stabbing of Troy LaFerrara, 42, in Sunbury. But he denied that she has killed 22 people - as she claims - and branded her a 'manipulator.' Police said LaFerrara met Barbour through her Craigslist ad, which offered companionship in exchange for money. Barbour, like the fictitious serial killer Dexter, said she only killed 'bad people.' 'Killer': Miranda Barbour (with a police officer in December) has been involved in more than one murder, her father has claimed. She is also accused of stabbing a man to death after meeting him on Craigslist . Investigators allege Barbour stabbed . LaFerrara about 20 times in her parked car as her husband, Elytte . Barbour, held a cord tight against LaFerrara's neck from the back seat . and then dumped his body in an alley. The . self-confessed teenage serial killer has claimed to have been involved . in a satanic cult and that she had a favorite knife which she added . notches to every time she slayed another victim. Dean told The Daily Item that his daughter was a heroin addict and is a liar and manipulator, but he doesn't think she is a mass murderer. 'Miranda lives in a fantasy world,' he said. Barbour . told The Daily Item last Friday that she had killed fewer than 100 . people but stopped counting at 22. She said she lured a man into an . alley in Alaska and watched as the leader of a satanic cult to which she . belonged shot the man before telling Barbour it was her turn. 'Believe very little of what Miranda says,' said Dean, of Texas. 'She has a long history of extreme manipulation and dishonesty. Victim: Barbour's father said he would hold the hand of his victim's widow, Colleen LaFerrara, while watching his daughter get executed. Colleen is pictured with husband Troy on their wedding day in 2011 . Investigation: Miranda Barbour is pictured right in her mug shot and left with her baby son. The father of the child died when her boy was one and authorities are now looking to see if his death was suspicious . 'She is good at manipulating people. She is the most manipulative person I have ever known.' It is possible she participated in a killing in Alaska, he said. He also did not dispute her claim of being a satanist. 'The reason I think that the Alaska incident is a possibility is that Miranda ran away from home at least two times that I remember, both for over a 48-hour period,' he said. 'Once was around the age of 13 and once was sometime the following year, when she was 14. I don't know what took place during either of those 48-hour periods.' Dean also said she had been in and out of treatment centers after she became hooked on heroin, and that she was so persuasive she was able to talk her way out of the centers. 'We couldn't stop it from happening and she was out.' he said. He . said once Miranda became hooked on drugs they refused to let her out of . the house unsupervised - meaning she could not have carried out the . many murders she has claimed. Scene: Miranda Barbour grew up in North Pole, Alaska (pictured), where she said she killed some victims. She later traveled south to North Carolina . Parallels: Like the fictitious serial killer Dexter (pictured), Barbour said she only killed 'bad people' 'Once . all this stuff with drugs started happening we locked our house down,’ he said. ‘She wouldn’t have had the chance to do any of these things she . said.’ His ex-wife Elizabeth Dean also denied her daughter could have been a serial killer. Dean said he prays for peace and comfort each morning for LaFerrara's . family, especially the victim's widow, Colleen LaFerrara. In . a prepared statement to the family, he said if a jury decides his . daughter should be executed, 'I would stand side by side with you, take . your hand, and silently pray that some good may come of this.' According to a police affidavit, Miranda Barbour initially denied knowing LaFerrara until she and her husband were presented with evidence.

Police say the body of a missing 22-year-old woman from suburban Philadelphia has been found inside a parked car near the city's 30th Street Station. Authorities identified the woman as Nadia Malik, of Marple Township. She was last seen on February 9 and was the subject of a multistate search. Police said the body was found just after 12pm Thursday in one of the front seats of her black Nissan. According to investigators, Malik was slumped over with a pile of books on top of her. Philadelphia Police Lt. John Walker told NBC10 the vehicle had been parked along 30th Street for nearly two weeks and had multiple parking tickets tucked under the windshield. The 2007 Nissan Altima was covered with snow from the recent winter storms most of the time it was in the location where it was discovered today following a tip from a caller who had recognized the vehicle from media reports. Police said the car's heavily tinted windows also made it more difficult to see the interior. Lt Walker said Malik's body showed no visible signs of trauma. An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death. Law enforcement officials are awaiting extradition of 25-year-old Bhupinder Singh, Malik's boyfriend, with whom she has two young daughters. Crime scene: Malik was slumped over in the passenger seat of the 2007 Nissan Altima covered in parking tickets . Singh has been in custody in Ohio since February 12, when he was detained by police for probation violations in Delaware County, as well as for questioning in Malik's disappearance. He has not been charged in her death. Malik's friend Thomas Singh, no relation to her boyfriend, told police that during a phone conversation with the 22-year-old, the woman allegedly told him that she was with her boyfriend and 'he wasn't letting her go,' The Delaware County Daily Times reported. One of Malik's five siblings spoke to Singh around the time of his sister's disappearance. Detective Kurt Lindelow said the brother heard Malik scream in the background before the phone cut off. Last call: One of Malik's siblings told police that he heard his sister scream while he was talking on the phone with her boyfriend, Bhupinder Singh . When police tracked down Singh to his parents' home in Solon, Ohio, the man claimed that he and Malik had a fight and he left her in the car back in Pennsylvania before boarding a Greyhound bus in New York.

Dozens of children are feared to have been left with badly marked skin after suffering reactions to paint following the ProudParents Fun Day at City Hall in Hull, East Yorkshire, on Monday. One seven-year-old girl has been left with a painful butterfly design burned onto her face after the event, while her nine-year-old cousin was left with a logo of his favourite rugby team on his cheek. Branded: Rhys Ablett, 9, (left) was left with the imprint of his favourite rugby league team on his face. His cousin Millie Bradley, 7, (right) has a butterfly design burned onto her cheek . Before the burn: The pair had been excited to have their faces painted during an event at Hull City Hall . Rhys Ablett asked to have the name of his favourite rugby league team, Hull FC, drawn on his at the event earlier this week, but was surprised to find it wouldn't properly wash off the following morning. His mother Kerry Bradley, 33, said: 'I washed it off on Monday night and his face looked fine but he woke up the next morning and his cheek was bright red.' 'At first, I thought I'd rubbed it off a bit hard but then on Wednesday it was even worse... I took him to the minor injuries unit because it looked really agitated. It was bright red and raised, like someone had scratched it or branded it onto him and he said it was sore,' she added. 'He was given an antihistamine and they said to put a cold compress on if it gets worse... It's awful as a parent to see your child like this', Ms Bradley went on. 'He's been really embarrassed about it and he didn't want to go to football training on Wednesday night because he thought all the kids would laugh at him, she said. Ms Bradley's niece, seven-year-old Millie, had a butterfly painted on her cheek and has also been left with suspected chemical burns. Her mother Donna Bradley, 32, said: 'Throughout Tuesday it just got worse and worse... It looks like it's the black paint which has marked her face so it must be an ingredient used in that colour.' 'I took her straight to the doctors on Tuesday and they said it could be chemical burns or it could be an allergic reaction,' she added. 'I don't see how it's an allergic reaction when we know at least ten other children who have experienced the same thing,' she went on. Both children were left with 'brands' on their cheeks after the face paint was washed off . Scene: The children had their faces painted during the ProudParents Fun Day at City Hall (pictured) in Hull, East Yorkshire, on Monday . Ms Bradley said Millie has had her face painted a number of times without a problem, but after what's happened this time she won't let her have it done again. 'I won't take the risk. It's been very upsetting and I'm just relieved it should heal within a few days', she said. 'I dread to think how many kids this has happened to because there was loads of children there and the queue for the face paints was huge,' she added, . Ms Bradley said she contacted the man who painted the children's faces, who told her he has never had any problems before. He is now contacting the face paint manufacturers to see if an ingredient could have reacted with the children's skin. Ms Bradley said: 'He has been very helpful but people need to be made aware of what happened, in case it has happened to their children.' Some parents have made comments about the problem on Facebook and contacted each other to seek advice, according to Ms Bradley. Rachel Roberts, of Hull City Council, told the Sun that 500 children had their faces painted on Monday and there had only been three complaints.

Targets to cut nitrogen dioxide levels, mainly caused by traffic fumes, should have been met by January 2010 . The Government now has two months to respond, and if it fails to present an acceptable plan it could face legal action and punitive fines.

Two men pleaded guilty Thursday to a 2011 beating at Dodger Stadium that left San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow brain damaged and severely disabled. They were immediately sentenced by an angry judge who called them cowards and the sort of people that sports fans fear when go to games. Louie Sanchez, 31, saying he kicked and punched Stow, pleaded guilty to one count of mayhem that disabled and disfigured the victim. He was sentenced to eight years in prison with credit for 1,086 days. Marvin Norwood pleaded guilty to one count of assault likely to produce great bodily injury and was sentenced to four years. His credit for time already in custody appeared to account for at least the majority of that term. Scroll down for video . Marvin Norwood, left, and Louie Sanchez even appeared to smirk as they were sentenced to several years in prison on Thursday . 'Cretins': David Stone - the father of beating victim Bryan Stow - lashed out at his attackers, and comforted his daughter Evin Collins - left . They were sentenced after Stow's family addressed the court. David Stow, the victim's father, placed a Giants ball cap on a podium. 'The years you spend in prison is what you cretins deserve,' he said. The victim's sister, Bonnie Stow, described her brother's life. 'We shower him, we dress him, we fix his meals,' she said. 'We make sure he gets his 13 medications throughout the day. He takes two different anti-seizure medications to prevent the seizures he endured for months after you brutally and cowardly attacked him.' Superior Court Judge George Lomeli called out Sanchez for smirking during sentencing. 'You not only ruined the life of Mr. Stow (but) his children, his family, his friends,' the judge said. Paramedic Bryan Stow, pictured before the attack, was suffered traumatic brain damage from the attack . He said the men only seemed to care when they will getting out of jail. 'One day you will be released,' he said, 'and Mr. Stow will forever be trapped in the condition you left him in.' The judge said he often takes his son to football games and 'my biggest fear is that we might run into people like you, who have no civility.' He concluded, 'it's only a game at the end of the day and you lost perspective.' Stow, a 45-year-old paramedic from Santa Cruz who attended the 2011 opening day game in Los Angeles between the Dodgers and the Giants, was beaten nearly to death in a parking lot after the game. He suffered brain damage and is permanently disabled, requiring 24-hour-a-day care. The beating prompted public outrage and led to increased security at Dodgers' games. A civil suit by Stow is pending against the Dodgers organization and former owner Frank McCourt. Sanchez and Norwood were arrested after a lengthy manhunt that briefly involved the arrest of an innocent man. The two acknowledged their involvement during a series of secretly recorded jailhouse conversations. Norwood was recorded telling his own mother by phone that he was involved and saying, 'I will certainly go down for it.' Stow, seen after the attack, no longer can care for himself and requires the constant attention of his family . The words the two men spoke in a jail lockup, unaware they were being recorded, were played at a preliminary hearing as they were ordered to stand trial on charges of mayhem and assault and battery. In a 12-minute conversation, Sanchez acknowledged he attacked a Giants fan, and Norwood said he had no regrets about backing him up. 'I socked him, jumped him and started beating him,' a transcript of the conversation quoted Sanchez, who also apologized to Norwood for dragging him into the fight. 'That happens, bro,' said Norwood. 'I mean, what kind of man would I have been if I hadn't jumped in and tried to help you.' Witnesses testified about the parking lot confrontation, saying Stow was jumped from behind and his head crashed to the pavement. Witnesses at the hearing said Sanchez taunted Giants fans throughout the game. Two witnesses who attended the March 31, 2011, game told of being bothered by Sanchez, who was throwing peanuts and spraying soda on a woman in the bleachers. His sister testified that Sanchez was drunk. Corey Maciel, a fellow paramedic who came with Stow from Northern California to cheer for the Giants, told of seeing his friend attacked and throwing his own body over him to prevent further harm. 'As soon as he was punched, he was unconscious and fell back on his head,' Maciel testified. 'He was unable to brace himself. I saw his head bounce off the concrete. I heard the crack.' The assailant then kicked Stow in the head at least three times and again in the torso, according to the testimony. Maciel said he heard profanities and one person say, '(expletive) the Giants. That's what you get.' 'I threw my body over Bryan's head to stop any more physical contact,' Maciel said. Another friend, also a paramedic, held the injured Stow's head to protect his spine. But he had already suffered devastating injuries. Last spring, Stow returned home after two years in hospitals and rehabilitation centers. His family said he requires constant physical therapy and remains severely disabled.","Bryan Stow was beaten nearly to death by rival fans while attending an LA Dodgers game .

The first modern variety of the breed was started in 1966, in Roncesvalles, Toronto when a hairless kitten named Prune was born to a black and white domestic shorthair cat in Ontario, Canada. The kitten was mated with its mother (backcrossing), which produced one more naked kitten. Together with a few naked kittens found later it founded the first attempt to create a hairless breed. Sphynxes are known for their extrovert behaviour. They display a high level of intelligence, curiosity, and affection for their owners.","Sphynx cats Gina and her son Prince Charming have been given coats .

A mother-of seven died after getting addicted to a powerful legal high which is fifty times stronger than cannabis, an inquest heard. Selina Nicholas, 49, took 30 hits a day of a potent blend of synthetic cannabis called Summer Haze. The substance was legal at the time but has since been banned because it contains chemicals which mimic genuine marijuana. Legal highs: Selina Nicholas, pictured, was found dead by one of her sons in 2012 . An inquest into Selina's death heard she got her fix from a local shop and from her boyfriend, who liked to mix his own supply to save money. Her family is now warning of the dangers of legal highs. Her son Adam said he is 'certain' they caused her death, despite the coroner saying it could not yet be proved. Ms Nicholas died in November 2012, after smoking for an entire weekend. One of her children, Zachary, found her body when he broke into her home in Exeter, Devon. Potent: Summer Haze, the type of drug Ms Nicholas used, can be 50 times stronger than regular cannabis . She was found next to an array of drug paraphernalia and legal highs, which she had been using regularly for around 18 months. A post mortem could not establish a cause of death, but toxicology reports tested positive for chemical compounds known as cannabinoids. The substances are typically sprayed on to herbs then sold and smoked like regular cannabis leaves, producing similar psychoactive effects. PC Scott Robertson, a drug liaison officer for Devon and Cornwall Police, told the inquest that 75 to 80 new legal highs came to the market in 2013 alone. He said: 'Because of the influx, toxicology has not caught up yet so we do not know the short-term effects. 'What we do know is synthetic cannabis can be up to 20-50 times more potent than normal cannabis and we are seeing far more adverse reactions. 'We are seeing an increasing number of people ending up in hospital and having an adverse reaction to the legal highs.' The inquest heard that Ms Nicholas had suffered with drug and alcohol addiction for most of her life. Her family say she went 'into a shell' after she started using legal highs, which she would either buy from the Hush head shop in Exeter or have them made for her by on-off boyfriend Pete Simmons. Mr Simmons said he had been a friend for 25 years and he would bring around his homemade stash each weekend for them to smoke. He told the hearing: 'Rightly or wrongly I believe the family are blaming me for her death. 'We had spent the weekend together and she had a couple of bongs on Friday night and some on Saturday and Sunday morning before I left. 'There was no indication when I left that anything was wrong. Part of the reason I made my own synthetic cannabis was Selina was going into Hush and spending a lot of money on pre-packaged stuff that was essentially the same thing. 'It was about a tenth of the price to do it myself.' Coroner Elizabeth Earland recorded an open verdict but said she could not establish for certain that legal highs had caused Selina's death. What went wrong? Ms Nicholas's boyfriend said there was no sign of anything being wrong when he last saw her . She said: 'It is a matter for drug enforcement agencies to analyse the data they have and potential risk and it is extremely difficult for them to come to conclusions with all the new products that keep coming to the market. 'I am satisfied she was a habitual user of cannabis and synthetic cannabis but she also suffered medical and mental health problems. 'I am not satisfied that any drug taking killed her or her medical problems killed her so I have to record an open verdict. 'In time we hope there will be more information but at the moment it appears those who are making it are one step ahead of the drug enforcement agencies. So it is up to individuals to be as aware as possible.' Early forms of synthetic cannabis, also known as spice, were first outlawed in 2009 when they were reclassified as class B drugs, making it illegal to sell or possess them. But since then police have had to constantly update the list of banned substances because manufacturers keep tinkering with the chemicals involved to get around the law. Adam Nicholas, one of Ms Nicholas's sons, said after the inquest that he was certain that legal highs were responsible. He said: 'Mum had been ill on and off for years. But suddenly she started taking and getting into legal highs. 'She had been on drugs throughout her life but after she started on the legal highs she started having more and more issues. 'She was in a much darker place and was a shell of who she was. 'They can't prove they killed her as the medical evidence and research is currently not available. But a 49-year-old woman's heart does not stop for no reason. 'Directly or indirectly, we all believe legal highs were responsible for her death. People don't realise the dangers and think that because they are legal they are OK.'","Selina Nicholas, 49, would take 30 hits a day of potent cannabis substitute .

Aaron Collis, 28, was sent to prison in 2009 after committing sexual offences against 22 children as young as 18-months-old . A paedophile nursery worker jailed for abusing children has demanded he is chemically castrated to prevent him reoffending. Aaron Collis, 28, was sent to prison in 2009 after committing sexual offences against 22 children as young as 18-months-old. But now in a desperate letter to prisoner newspaper ‘Inside Time’ Collis has begged the authorities to allow him to be castrated . Collis claims the procedure - designed to reduce libido and sexual activity - is the only thing that could stop him abusing children again. In 2012 around 100 paedophiles were chemically castrated under a voluntary Government scheme to stop them reoffending. The father-of-two claims prison rehabilitation and treatment programmes for sex offenders 'won’t make a bit of difference.' In the letter to the February edition Collis wrote: 'I am only speaking for myself because I know my own mind, I know my triggers and I know that the SOTP [Sex Offenders’ Treatment Programme] alone is simply not going to lower my risk. Collis said he has spoken to medical experts but has not been successful. He wrote: 'I thought they would jump at the chance to take away my sex drive, but I was very wrong.' 'They all seem to be trying to talk me out of it, telling me I’m young and it’s not necessary.' 'Well, I’m sorry, but it’s my body and my messed up brain which is dangerous and this is my decision.'I’m not going to let this go, even if I have to go to the European Court of Human Rights. I will be a free man in a few years and this is a huge factor in deciding how bright my future will be.' Collis, who is in HMP Peterborough, was handed an indeterminate sentence with a minimum of five years at Cambridge Crown Court in 2009. Collis, a father of two, is currently in HMP Peterborough, pictured. He was handed an indeterminate sentence with a minimum of five years at Cambridge Crown Court in 2009 . Chemical castration involves a man taking hormones that suppress the production of testosterone, leading to a decreased sex drive. The medication is intended for use on those with compulsive or impulsive urges to offend and those who have difficulties in controlling sexual arousal, intrusive sexual fantasies or urges, sadism or other 'dangerous' tendencies such as necrophilia. One drug used, leuprorelin (marketed as Prostap) inhibits the typically high sex drives of paedophiles by limiting the production of testosterone. But the manufacturers admit it is likely that 'only small numbers of sex offenders will benefit from these treatments.' Poland introduced mandatory chemical castration for some sex offenders in 2009, it was introduced in South Korea in September and Russia and Moldova are following suit. Both Germany and the Czech Republic have been criticised by Europe's top human rights body for using voluntary surgical castration to treat sex offenders. In 2012, Collis was brought back before a judge at the same court after admitting 12 further offences. The court was told Collis had written to paedophile Vanessa George offering her 'support' and admitted he was envious of her 'notoriety'. The judge was told Collis also claimed he was in love with one of the four-year-old girls he targeted and it felt like he was being unfaithful  when he abused other girls. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence to serve a minimum of five years - resetting the clock on his minimum required time to serve. Collis worked at Snap! Nursery in Chesterton, Cambridgeshire and the Funky Fun House play centre in Abbey, Cambridgeshire. But none of his crimes were committed at either of his workplaces. Chemical castration is not unneard of in Britain -  two years ago dozens of sex offenders volunteered to take drugs designed to stifle their libido during a pilot experiment at HMP Whatton in Nottinghamshire. The drug reduces their testosterone levels to that of a prepubescent boy for a three-month period. After that, it wears off. Those in the trial included rapist Neil Wilkinson, who later killed his cellmate, and Barry Wade, who was jailed for seven years for offences against two young girls. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said at the time: 'We support the use of pharmaceutical interventions for high risk sex offenders given the evidence that it can be useful in reducing risk for some perpetrators.' The drug is already mandatory for child sex offenders in Poland, Russia and certain U.S. states. Chemical castration can cut the rates of reoffending from 40 per cent to five per cent, according to researchers in Scandinavia. 'Why is it so hard to convince people what is best for my own rehabilitation? The so-called experts are obsessed with these silly courses which cannot possibly work on someone like me. 'I am a 28 year-old sex offender who has always openly admitted his crimes from the word go. 'I hate what I have done and for 4 years now I’ve been in the prison system trying to find a ‘cure’ for the incurable.

Email alert: Sir Bruce Keogh urged officials three months ago to launch a series of investigations . Health bosses have been accused of trying to cover up high death rates and alarming waiting times in the NHS in Wales. The medical director in England Professor Sir Bruce Keogh urged officials three months ago to launch a series of investigations into six hospitals after being alerted to the figures by a Welsh Labour MP. He also pointed out that waiting times in Wales were ‘persistently higher’ than in England, with up to 80 per cent of patients waiting more than six weeks for key diagnostic tests for diseases such as cancer. However bosses didn’t reply to his email – nor did they launch any investigation. The revelation comes amid growing concern over the state of the NHS in Wales. Labour – which has been in power in Wales since devolution in 1999 – runs the country’s NHS separately from the health service in England. It has not ring-fenced the NHS budget as the Coalition has done. Instead spending on the Welsh NHS has been slashed by 11 per cent since 2011. There is now growing evidence that the financial cuts are having a knock-on effect on waiting times, in A&E and on the overall standards of care in hospitals. At one hospital, three nurses have been arrested amid claims of serious patient neglect. The Princess of Wales hospital in Bridgend was already under the spotlight over the death of a patient who waited four hours in an ambulance before being admitted to A&E. In his email, sent to his Welsh counterpart Dr Chris Jones on November 28 last year, Sir Bruce pointed to figures showing that around 50 per cent of Welsh patients wait at least six weeks for bowel cancer scans compared to around 1 to 2 per cent in England. Similarly for MRI scans – which are used to detect everything from cancer, dementia and muscular injuries – 48.6 per cent of patients wait six weeks or more compared to less than 1 per cent of English patients. And 80 per cent of patients were waiting 6 weeks or longer for urine tests which can be used to detect bladder cancer. Sir Bruce wrote: ‘There are six hospitals with a persistently high mortality which warrant investigating.‘I do not have adequate data to form a view. ‘Waiting times in A&E are considerably worse than England, but the real concern is around prolonged (longer than 6 weeks) waiting times for diagnostics (scans which include cancer tests) including which, of course, translates to delayed treatment.’ Last night MPs said the situation was ‘deeply disturbing’ and accused the Labour Assembly of covering up the truth about the state of its  hospitals. They likened the situation in Wales to other scandals such as Mid Staffordshire, which occurred when Labour was in power. The Princess of Wales hospital in Bridgend was already under the spotlight over the death of a patient . Charlotte Leslie, Tory MP for Bristol North West said: ‘This is an abominable indictment of Labour’s attitude to the NHS. ‘Now, in the last corner of the country where Labour is still in charge of health, what do we see, but exactly the same efforts to protect political self-interest over patients’ lives. ‘Just like with Mid-Staffs, we find all the effort focused not on investigating hospitals of concern, but an effort to discredit the data, potentially at the cost of peoples’ lives.’ The six hospitals Sir Bruce said he was concerned  about include the Princess of Wales, University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, Royal Gwent in Newport, Royal Glamorgan near Llantrisant, and three community hospitals. He was alerted by MP Ann Clwyd, who in 2012 exposed how her husband died like a ‘battery hen’ in a Glasgow hospital. The Labour MP for Cynon Valley, said: ‘The situation is deeply disturbing. I have been calling for an inquiry into death rates for some time because several of the figures are extremely worrying. ‘People in Wales ought to be able to have as good care as anywhere else, but instead here are people dying on hospital waiting lists, and suffering appalling failings in care.’ A Welsh Assembly spokesman said: ‘Mortality rates in Wales are published on a quarterly basis  and latest figures demonstrate clear improvement. If issues are identified, we work quickly to put them right and we do not hesitate to investigate as needed. ‘To suggest that the Welsh NHS is covering up high death rates is therefore utterly ridiculous and completely without foundation.’ Concerns: Former nurse Glenda Rodriguez-Noza . For years campaigners have been trying to get a proper investigation into claims of serious neglect at the Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend. Cases where patients have suffered ‘prolonged, unnecessary suffering’ haunt the families involved. Three nurses have been arrested over falsifying patient records at the hospital after staff blew the whistle. Bereaved relatives have sought help from the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, but many are calling for a full public inquiry. An independent review was ordered by the Welsh government, prompted by the ‘unacceptable’ care of Lillian Williams, an 82-year-old amputee who was admitted to the hospital four times before she died there in August 2012. Her son Gareth Williams said: ‘Lillian was left Nil by Mouth on one occasion for two days without assessment because it was a weekend and the assessment teams didn’t work on the weekends. It was nothing short of torture.’ Doctors told Mrs Williams’s family she had pneumonia and that the hospital would withdraw support of all food, water and medication. She died four days later when the family insisted on a post-mortem examination. Mr Williams said: ‘There was no pneumonia. She died of a heart attack after days without nutrition and after days deprived of life-saving medications for her heart and diabetes. ‘It was the most cruel, prolonged, unnecessarily suffering death. It haunts us.’ Former nurse Glenda Rodriguez-Noza, who worked at the hospital for eight years before leaving in 2009, says she raised several complaints about patient care but was ignored. She said she saw an infected room poorly cleaned before it was used by other patients, a dementia patient being roughly handled by a nurse and a nurse give the patient the wrong medication. An urgent review is under way following the death last month of a 58-year-old man attended by paramedics in an ambulance outside the hospital for more than four hours before being admitted to the emergency department. A statement from Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said: ‘We apologise sincerely to the patients and families who we have let down at the Princess of Wales Hospital. ‘In May 2013 we invited an external team – Advancing Quality Alliance – to review quality and safety at the hospital. This was in response to serious complaints about care provided to some patients; critical Ombudsman’s reports; mortality rates, and a police investigation into allegations of falsification of records by some of our nurses.’","Professor Sir Bruce Keogh urged officials to launch investigations .

"PUBLISHED: . 17:40 EST, 20 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:55 EST, 20 February 2014 . There’s no doubting her formidable literary talent. But on this occasion, Barbara Taylor Bradford has forsaken the finesse so often evident in her bestselling novels to deliver a rather blunt assessment of French President Francois Hollande, branding the Frenchman ‘a stupid man’. The novelist attacked the 59-year-old premier over his affair with actress Julie Gayet, saying the sordid revelations about his turbulent love life wouldn’t even be fit for the pages of one of her popular page-turners. Author Barbara Taylor Bradford (left) has come out against President Hollande, saying his life doesn't correlate with her books (right) The 80-year-old, who celebrated her 50th wedding anniversary with her husband Bob on Christmas Eve, also suggested that Mr Hollande’s son had introduced his father to Miss Gayet in a bid to seek revenge on journalist Valerie Trierweiler, who the president had left the mother of his children for. Mr Hollande has never married, but has four children Thomas, 29, Clémence, 28, Julien, 26 and Flora, 21, with fellow socialist politician Segolene Royal. Miss Trierweiler became his live-in girlfriend following his separation from Royal in 2007. Mr Hollande then met Miss Gayet at a lunch organised by his son Thomas in 2012. It was arranged after Thomas’ girlfriend Joyce Jonathan, a pop star who is close friends with the 41-year-old Miss Gayet, asked if the actress could come along to discuss the arts. Miss Taylor Bradford was asked whether Mr Hollande’s behaviour could form the basis of one of her blockbuster novels. Too stupid: Taylor Bradford, who has been awarded an OBE for her writing, claims Francois Hollande is too dim to be analogous to one her characters . She told The Lady Magazine: ‘I couldn’t possibly write about such a stupid man. ‘Here is a man who had four children with a woman and then after 30 years he dumps her for this journalist, Valérie Trierweiler, and in the meantime it turns out he’s been cheating on her for two years. ‘It was his son by Royal who introduced him to that actress Julie Gayet – did you know that? So the son was getting his revenge for his mother – that’s what I think as a novelist!’ There is no love lost between Miss Trierweiler and Mr Hollande’s four children, who they see as having broken up his relationship with their mother. Miss Royal announced her split with Mr Hollande on the day she lost her presidential bid in 2007, but his relationship with Miss Trierweiler is said to have already been going on for around two years. His children refused to speak to her for a year after she once sent a Twitter message expressing support for Olivier Falorni, a Socialist politician running against Miss Royal in parliamentary elections. Asked if Britons had been intrigued by French women because they are ‘thinner and more chic,’ Miss Taylor Bradford the said: ‘Well, I do think they are thinner and “chicer”, actually. ‘And I wonder what their secret is about being thinner. But I don’t like being too bitchy about French women – or any woman. I don’t want to say anything about the three that are caught up in this – the mother of his children, the mistress and mistress number two. ‘Will there be a mistress number three? Jimmy Goldsmith said it best: “When you marry your mistress, you create a vacancy.”’ Although Hollande has never married, she added: ‘Maybe they didn’t want to marry him, I don’t know, but if it had been me, I would have wanted to be married.’ Happier daysL French president-elect Francois Hollande kisses his companion Valerie Trierweiler in 2012. Hollande recently left Trierweiler for actress Julie Gayet . Yorkshire-born Miss Taylor Bradford has sold over 88m books in more than 90 countries, with many of her works being made into movies or TV mini-series. Her debut novel, A Woman of Substance, published in in 1979, ranks among the top 10 bestselling fiction books of all time with over 32m copies sold. The acclaimed author was awarded an O.B.E. for her services to literature in 2007. She and her husband, a television producer, celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary on Christmas Eve last year. The couple have never had children. They have tried to start a family in the past, but the author has admitting having two miscarriages.","Novelist attacked President over his recent affair with Julie Gayet .

Grandma Susan Burgess was just 59 when she died on December 5, 2012 after suffering a pulmonary embolism . A care home nurse who refused to attempt CPR or call an ambulance after a grandmother stopped breathing has been condemned by the lady's daughter. Susan Burgess was just 59 when she died on December 5, 2012 after suffering a pulmonary embolism in her room at Holme House care home in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire. Nurse Winifred Jozi was called when . Mrs Burgess was found at 6.20am but an inquest heard she refused to . attempt resuscitation and didn’t even call for an ambulance - instead, . choosing to ring the non-emergency NHS Direct service. Mrs Burgess, who had been staying at the care home because she was suffering from dementia, was pronounced dead an hour later. Coroner Oliver Longstaff blasted Mrs Jozi after the inquest at Kirklees Coroner’s Court in Huddersfield was told she had been sacked and suspended from working as a nurse pending an investigation by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Mrs Burgess’ daughter, Julie Marsden, 40, claims Mrs Jozi - the only nurse on duty - didn’t even check her mother’s pulse, and said she knew there was nothing she could do 'just by looking at her'. She said: 'I’m absolutely appalled with the actions of nurse Jozi. 'She claimed that she knew my mum was dead just by looking at her, so she didn’t even check her pulse or do any of the other checks that a medical professional should do. 'I’m not a nurse and if someone looked to be in trouble I would do whatever I could to help. 'But this nurse, who claims to have 20 years of experience, just stood back and didn’t even attempt to help. Mrs Burgess was found at 6.20am in her room at Holme House care home in Cleckheaton, West Yorks . 'She just looked at my mum and said, ‘there’s nothing I can do’. She didn’t even try. She didn’t do her job.' The inquest heard that Mrs Burgess, of nearby Dewsbury, was last seen alive in her chair at 5.45am. A doctor had ordered she was checked every half an hour due to a suspected water infection. At 6.20pm staff summoned Mrs Jozi who refused to attempt CPR on Mrs Burgess because it was ‘not beneficial’, the court heard. Instead she called NHS Direct who told her an operator would call back within two hours. The inquest heard other staff were unhappy with the nurse’s decision and called 999 - when they were told by the emergency operator to try to resuscitate Mrs Burgess before an ambulance arrived. A postmortem found she had died from blood clots in her lungs coupled with pneumonia. The coroner accepted that it was unlikely Mrs Burgess would have survived, even if CPR had been attempted, but added: 'It seems Mrs Jozi didn’t look for a pulse. She took the proverbial ‘one look’ at her and decided she was dead. Nurse Winifred Jozi was dismissed from her post and her actions being reported to the Nursing and Midwifery Council . 'I simply don’t understand how nurse Jozi in her professional capacity could accept a callback in two hours as an appropriate response to unexpected death.' Mother-of-two Mrs Marsden, who lives with partner Simon, 52, added: 'My mum used to work as a care assistant and she was the most loving, caring person you could ask for. I’m upset she didn’t get the same treatment herself when she needed it. 'As far as I can see, the nurse hasn’t been remorseful at all. It’s almost as if she doesn’t think she did anything wrong. 'She was a nurse who should have been able to deal with anybody who’s stopped breathing.' A spokesperson for Croft Care, which runs Holme House, said: 'The management of the home found that the registered nurse did not follow the protocols that the home had in place . 'The home reported this to Kirklees Council Safeguarding Team and the police at the time of the incident and the company carried out a full investigation into her actions culminating in her being dismissed from her post and her actions being reported to the Nursing and Midwifery Council. 'The due diligence of the other staff who did follow the protocol that was in place ensured a professional response to the poor practice of the nurse in charge. 'The company is disappointed that it was not invited to attend or comment at the inquest. 'The manager of the home worked closely with the family at the time of the incident and the company offers its deepest sympathy at the loss of their loved one.'","Susan Burgess died from a pulmonary embolism at Holme House care home in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire .

An eyewitness account of Lawrence of Arabia’s Arab revolt is among an archive of previously unseen papers about the expedition due to go under the hammer in London next month. In one letter never sent, the British officer leader immortalised by Peter O’Toole in David Lean’s epic film about the crusade, is congratulated by his superior officer for 'your tremendous results and no one else could have done it.' The historical collection written by Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe is expected to fetch up to £30,000 and consists of three Army Field Service Correspondence Books issued to officers to record their activities, enemy positions and deployments. An eyewitness account of Lawrence of Arabia¿s Arab revolt is among an archive of previously unseen papers about the expedition due to go under the hammer in London next month . It also includes a wealth of papers and letters to colleagues including T. E. Lawrence who remained close friends with Newcombe, up until his death in a motorcycle accident in Dorset in 1935. Book specialist Matthew Haley, of Bonham’s in London where the stash is due to go under the hammer on March 19, said: 'The Newcombe diaries have never been seen before and are a major addition to understanding both of Lawrence and of the relationship between the British and the local leaders of the Arab Revolt at this crucial period.' The historical collection written by Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe is expected to fetch up to £30,000 . They cover the guerrilla operations in 1917 to disable the strategically important Hejaz Railway and to tie up Ottoman troops in its defence. The Ottoman Empire had entered the First World War in November 1914 on the German side in the hope of recapturing lost territories, including parts of modern-day Jordan and Saudi Arabia . The British, fearful of the impact on oil fields in the Middle East, fought alongside Arab nationalists, most notably Prince Faisal, who wanted to drive the Turks from his land in modern Saudi Arabia, specifically from the holy sites of Mecca and Medina. Faisal went on to become king of Iraq, while his brother Abdullah was the first king of Jordan. A letter dated July 10 1917, which provides an insight both into Newcombe’s style and the type of war he was waging, read: 'I’m just back from a stunt with Joyce & Davenport: we had to go 32 miles to the railway without water & of course return at once. We broke 450 rails on 6th night 7th morning at kilo 1027, just N. of Seil Matran. A film still from Lawrence of Arabia starring Peter O'Toole . 'Davenport has now gone to a well we dug in W. Jezzil, nearer the railway & should destroy 3 to 400 rails more or less nightly.' Bonham’s spokesman Andrew Currie said Joyce and Davenport would have been fellow British officers working with Newcombe. Reflecting on those times in his autobiography Seven Pillars of Wisdom, Lawrence, who was an intelligence officer with the rank of captain at the time, wrote of his friend and colleague: 'Newcombe had constant difficulties from his excess of zeal, and his habitual doing four times what any other Englishman would do, and ten times what the Arabs thought needful or wise. Newcombe is like fire... he burns friend and enemy.' According to Lawrence, Newcombe wore out Prince Faisal’s best camels with his constant to-ing and fro-ing. A letter written to Lawrence by Newcombe but never sent shows the closeness between the two men. It read: 'I’ve always regretted just having missed you when you first went to Abdulla’s and again early in May: and it made a great difference to my shows not having you with Faisal to back me up and buck him up. 'Anyway I very sincerely congratulate you on your tremendous results and no one else could have done it. We others can’t disguise the fact that we are British & its no use trying to be unnaturally Arab when one can’t: and I’ve not succeeded.' Mr Currie said Abdullah was a 'significant figure' as he was among the leaders of the Arab revolt, and later became the first King of Jordan. He said: 'We do not know why the correspondence praising Lawrence was not dispatched by Newcombe. 'He could have thought better of it. But they would have been moving around the whole time and it may just be he never got around to it. But for whatever reason, Lawrence never actually saw it.' Mr Currie said the auction is expected to attract bids from British and overseas collectors because Lawrence was such an important figure, as well as museums eager to get their hands on the material. But the death of Peter O’Toole who shot to fame playing him in the 1962 Oscar winning movie Lawrence of Arabia was unlikely to attract additional interest. Mr Currie said: 'He is so famous I do not think that will play any part in increasing attention around the auction. He is like Churchill, there will be alot of international appeal, especially in the Arab world.' Stewart Newcombe and TE Lawrence first met in 1913. Lawrence was godfather to the Newcombes’ first child and Newcombe was one of the pall bearers at Lawrence’s funeral. The archive has remained with the family since Lt Col Newcombe’s death in 1956.","In one letter the World War One leader is congratulated by superior officer .

A three-year-old girl drowned in her family’s swimming pool after the teenage boy looking after her fell asleep on a lilo, an inquest heard today. Marissa Cimmino had been left at home with the boy while her mother Evelyn went to run an errand, expecting her husband to return from a game of golf. Mrs Cimmino forgot to tell husband Vincenzo that Marissa was at the house and he thought his wife had taken their daughter with her. When the confusion was discovered upon his return, he ran to the pool and pulled his lifeless daughter out of the water. The inquest heard that Marissa knew she had to wear her lifejacket and be supervised while using the pool, but was discovered with no lifejacket on. Lower Broadmoor Road in Crowthorne, Berkshire, where the girl lived with her family . The coroner heard that Mrs Cimmino left the family home in Lower Broadmoor Road, Crowthorne, Berkshire, just after 1pm on August 28 to make a short trip to Reading, thinking Mr Cimmino would return within an hour. Marissa had been playing in the 18-foot long swimming pool that morning, supervised by a young teenage boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. 'I didn’t want to upset Marissa by taking her away,' she said. 'I assumed my husband was on his way back due to the time. I assumed he would be no longer than 30 minutes.' The inquest, in Windsor, Berkshire, heard that Mrs Cimmino sent a text message at 2.32pm asking her husband how long he would be and he said he had been delayed. At 2.40pm he arrived home, as he received a second message. Neither message mentioned that his young daughter had been left playing in the pool. 'I assumed Marissa was with my wife, but it wasn’t discussed,' said Mr Cimmino in a statement. Mrs Cimmino returned home 15 minutes after her husband. 'The first thing she said was ""where’s Marissa?"", I said ""I thought she was with you"",' he said. 'It was just a feeling I had, I went straight out towards the garden. I ran to the pool, saw Marissa floating face down and scooped her out and laid her down, starting CPR.' The teenager, who had been asleep on a lilo in the pool, then woke up and Mrs Cimmino said she screamed at him and told him to call an ambulance. Unable to find a phone, the boy ran to neighbour Virginia Bowyer, who had first aid training, and she ran to Marissa’s aid. Mr Bedfod said transcripts of a 999 call made by Mrs Cimmino revealed that she could be heard shouting: 'I can’t believe you fell asleep and left her in the pool' as well as questioning why Marissa had no lifejacket on. Mrs Bowyer was joined by another neighbour, Suzan Laverick, a retired nurse, and the pair took over CPR on Marissa until a paramedic, doctor and then an air ambulance arrived. Mr Cimmino told Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford: 'I was so angry I went into the kitchen drawer, got a knife and stabbed the side of the swimming pool.' Marissa was flown to Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey but, despite more than an hour of resuscitation attempts, she was pronounced dead at just before 5pm. Mr Bedford explained that, while Marissa had been left with her lifejacket on, she was not wearing it when she was found. He asked: 'Could she take it off on her own?' Mrs Cimmino replied: 'I think they had got out of the pool, had lunch and watched TV and then he (the boy) had got back in. 'I really thought Marissa would be fine for the short time until my husband came back.' A post-mortem examination recorded the cause of death as drowning. Detective Inspector Andy Howard, of Thames Valley Police, said he spoke to the boy and described him as a 'very mature and sensible boy' who was very capable of looking after Marissa for the time in question. 'Tragically that time period was longer than anybody expected,' said Mr Bedford, who praised the courage of Mr and Mrs Cimmino, who work as an electrical engineer and hairdresser respectively, in providing statements. 'What you have experienced is every parent’s nightmare,' he said, adding that he agreed with the explanation that Marissa and the boy had left the pool, removing their jackets, before he returned and she climbed in without him knowing as he was asleep. 'Marissa’s parents would not be human if they did not blame themselves - Mr Cimmino, if he had got home earlier from golf and Mrs Cimmino if she had taken Marissa with her. 'This was a series of events that nobody could have foreseen and certainly nobody would have wished to have occurred.' He recorded a verdict of accidental death. Mr and Mrs Cimmino declined to comment after the hearing.","Little Marissa Cimmino was found in the pool by her parents .

Women between the ages of 18-25 are being targeted more than men as pickpockets travel up to 17 miles to known hotspots . Young women between the ages of 18-24 are being targeted by sinister out of town pickpocketing gangs who are willing to travel up to 17 miles to Britain's hotspots. Criminals are now choosing to target victims during weekday afternoons in particular, as the number of incidents continues to rise, according to a Home Office report. Thieves with an average age of 32 travel large distances to seek out people in certain hotspots, with almost half the crimes occurring in London and others in urban areas including Greater Manchester and the West Midlands. Young women are targeted more than men - and weekend victims tend to be people out on a night out, the report said. The thefts, which include bag snatching and pickpocketing, rose by 7 per cent throughout last year up to September to 110,000 crimes, according to the figures from the Office for National Statistics. Pickpockets commonly target people on their own or who have been drinking, and according to the British Transport Police website, mobile phone users should be especially aware of passers by attempting to snatch their gadgets. Police are encouraging people to keep wallets in their inside pockets, zip up their bags and not to display jewellery too much in public areas. Figures released in January by British Transport Police showed out of 5,280 reported pickpocketing incidents on the London Underground between November 1, 2012 and October 31, 2013, there were just 170 convictions. Pickpocketing is on the increase as more criminals target people on weekday afternoons or when they are on a night out over the weekend .","Figures show pickpocketing and bag thefts are on the rise in Britain .

An armed robber jailed for carrying out a string of 100 raids to fund a Champagne lifestyle, robbed a succession of banks while on day release - and then tried to blame 'bankers greed' for the attacks. Sean Bradish, 46, held up . terrified cashiers and threatened to shoot them and their customers - while he was being 'reintegrated into society'. He . was being given ‘away days’ from Spring Hill jail a category ‘D’ prison . in Aylesbury when he carried out repeated raids on banks and building societies - often within hours of walking . through the prison gates, a court heard. Armed robber Sean Bradish was jailed for carrying out a string of 100 raids to fund a champagne lifestyle. But he robbed a succession of banks while on day release - and then tried to blame 'bankers greed' the attacks . One cashier was robbed three times at the same branch and told Bradish ‘You’re kidding me’ when he appeared at her till again. Bradish posed as a latter day Robin Hood telling staff: ‘You b*****ds are robbing the public.’ Judge Nicholas Cook demanded to know why . prison authorities were not required to ask prisoners exactly what they . were doing on their days out. ‘There will undoubtedly be public . interest in such chilling offences carried out when the prisoner was on . release from a life sentence,’ he said. Bradish will now be sentenced at the Old Bailey tomorrow. His first raid on the Lloyds TSB in Finchley Road on April 28 2012 was carried out four hours after he left prison. Wearing a hooded jacket and balaclava he pointed a handgun at staff and grabbed £4,500 shouting: ‘Give me all the money.’ Bradish arrived back at the prison late - but was allowed to continue his day release scheme. On . May 12 he was back at the same bank and robbed cashier Piera Ventouroli . for the first time, escaping with £4,000 after pointing the gun at . customers. For his third raid on July 20 he was at Lloyds TSB in . Kingsbury Road and made off with £8,500 after warning: ‘If you don’t . give me the money I’ll shoot the customers. He also told a cashier: ‘You’re the b*****ds robbing the public.’ Ms Ventouroli was at the bank when he returned on September 28 and gasped:’You’re kidding me’ when he appeared at her till. ‘She could not believe she had been robbed again,’ said prosecutor James Lofthouse. Bradish ‘strolled’ out with £8,500 . He was back at the back on February 8 last year and robbed Ms Ventouroli for the third time. This time she could only say ‘Oh no, oh no,’ as he entered the bank. By this time he had been released from jail on licence and he used his son’s mountain bike to ride off. Bradish tried to raid the Nat West Bank in Cricklewood Broadway on March 22. He pulled a gun on a security guard, but he had just dropped his delivery of £25,000 into a delivery chute. The guard said later: ’I felt lucky to be alive. I thought I was going to be shot.’ Bradish was forced to flee emply-handed even after he had pointed the gun at he head of a customer. Three days later he raided Barclays Bank in Ickenham and escaped with £13,135. He . was being watched by the Flying Squad as he drove his partner’s . Mercedes A6 to the back and burst in shouting: ‘I’ll shoot you, give me . all your money.’ An elderly woman who was a regular customer at the bank was terrified as Bradish left the back scattering notes behind him.

The . judge said Sean Bradish, who was then already serving a life sentence, . should serve 13 years and five months before he was considered for . parole. The Bradish Boys also hit security vans and bingo halls, netting more than £500,000. They spent the loot on cars, women and drugs .

They posed for pictures swigging bottles of champagne after threatening to shoot bank cashiers and staff . The brothers would wear balaclavas and surgical gloves to terrify cashiers with fully loaded pistols, revolvers and shotguns. Sean loved to find customers in banks because he could threaten them to force cashiers to hand over money. Throughout the raids his finger was on the trigger of his favourite sawn-off shotgun or pistol. Bradish, . who now has a full beard and glasses, admitted six robberies, one . attempted robbery, and seven counts of possession of an imitation . firearm with intent. Bradish did not enter pleas to a further armed robbery and attempted robbery, charges that will lie on file. He began his 100 raid spree on January 15, 1995 was when he . and an accomplice struck at the London Electricity Board at Kilburn High . Road. On February 28, 1997 they grabbed £64,064 from the Thomas Cook . travel agent in Wallington, Surrey and were covered in red dye when one . of the booby-trapped wads of notes exploded. On May 5, 1997 the brothers threatened to shoot a guard as they plundered £13,000 from a Tesco supermarket in Sutton. The raid was captured on the CCTV and the film was used on the television programme ‘Britain’s Most Wanted.’ Officers from the Flying Squad mounted one of their biggest ever operations to nail the Bradish Brothers. But . the robbers so terrified cashiers when they returned to the Thomas Cook . in Wallington that they were caught on CCTV tearfully hugging each . other in relief after the robbers had gone. After a raid at the HSBC . in Coulsdon, Surrey, the trio fled with £5,527 and celebrated that night . at the Holiday Inn at Sutton taking pictures of each other with . champagne. In October 2000 the gang were filmed by the Flying Squad preparing to rob the Co-op in Rose Hill, Sutton. Roberts told the court: ‘The money was spent on cars, clothes, living in hotels, drink and drugs.’ He explained the gang managed to evade the police for years because they were so security conscious. ‘We would walk around. We would be looking everywhere,’ he said. ‘We would go round roundabouts three or four times before going up the way we came to see if there was anybody behind us. ‘It was to see if there was any Flying Squad there on motorbikes or in cars. ‘We knew what some of the bikes they used looked like.

These are the horrifying injuries suffered by a teenager who was beaten up by two youths in an unprovoked attack. Chris Hopkinson, 18, released the images after his attackers Reece Hardy and Jordon Humphrey were locked up after admitting two counts of assault and one of causing grievous bodily harm. The photographs show how the student - who is now scarred for life - was punched beyond recognition in Creswell, Derbyshire, as his face was transformed into a swollen, bloody pulp. Horrific injuries: Chris Hopkinson - who is now scarred for life - was punched beyond recognition in Creswell, Derbyshire, as his face was transformed into a swollen, bloody pulp . The vicious assault, which left Mr Hopkinson unconscious, happened on May 1 last year as he and a few friends from nearby Staveley attended a birthday party in the neighbouring village. Derby Crown Court heard last week how Hardy, 18, and Humphrey, 19, from Creswell, were spoiling for a fight as they attacked two other teenagers. One was punched inside the party at Creswell Social Centre, and another was hit in the face outside the club, before they turned on Mr Hopkinson. Mark Knowles, prosecuting, told how Mr Hopkinson was knocked to the ground and kicked while he was unconscious. Mr Knowles said: ‘He was kicked by both defendants and a witness said it was like the volleying of a football and involved a stamping on the head.’ Speaking after the case, Mr Hopkinson said: ‘There was so much blood. It was unreal. ‘My t-shirt and jeans were covered. I had . my head on this girl’s lap while I was coming round afterwards and her . legs were covered in blood too. Stitched up: Mr Hopkinson (left and right) was knocked to the ground and kicked while he was unconscious . ‘I had cuts on my face, swelling to my . left check but my right eyebrow was the worst - it was nearly coming . off. I had to hold it on so it didn’t peel away with all the blood . running down my face. ‘A few people from the area told me it looked like there had been a murder because there was so much blood in the road. 'My . right eyebrow was the worst - it was nearly coming off. I had to hold . it on so it didn’t peel away with all the blood running down my face' Chris Hopkinson . ‘I came round and thought I . was alright, I told the police officer I was going to go home and he . said you’re not going anywhere. He showed me a picture of my injuries . and I was so shocked.’ Mr . Hopkinson, who was treated at Chesterfield Royal Hospital and wants to . be a traffic police officer, explained Hardy and Humphrey attacked his . friends before turning on him. The . teenager struggled through his A-Level exams just two days after the . bloodbath with dizziness and headaches - and has been forced to re-do . his studies to get better grades. Mr Hopkinson said: ‘After it happened I . woke and it hurt and I couldn’t open my eyes because of the swelling. I . was attacked on a Friday and my exams started on the Monday. Sentenced: Reece Hardy (left), 18, and Jordon Humphrey (right), 19, admitted two counts of assault and one of causing grievous bodily harm. Hardy was locked up for 22 months and Humphrey was given 20 months . ‘But every time I looked at the exam paper I got dizzy. Now I’m going to still be at school while all my friends go off to university. ‘I didn’t feel comfortable going out by myself or going to parties - and when I got back to playing cricket for Staveley Miners’ Welfare, I wasn’t at my best. 'What you (Reece Hardy and Jordon Humphrey) did was terrible.

Will Bennett, defending Humphrey, who was given a 20-month sentence, said he was drunk and was sickened by what he had done. Neither had previous convictions. Judge John Burgess said: ‘What you (Hardy and Humphrey) did was terrible. All you have to do is look at the photographs of this young man - look at the scarring. ‘He will have to endure comments. People ask him what happened and he feels people who don’t know him question whether he is trouble.’","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

Three teenagers - one female and two males - are to be tried as adults after allegedly luring a 16-year-old boy into a shed, shooting him with a BB gun, attacking him with a crow bar and carving a swastika into his forehead with a box cutter. Jenna Jean Montgomery, 15, Blue Christian Kalmbach, 15, and Jess Taylor, 17, pleaded not guilty to attacking 16-year-old Dustyn Murrain and were each held on a $3 million bail bond at a court hearing yesterday. A fourth suspect, an unnamed 14-year-old male, who is also accused of taking part in the assault on the schoolboy, will be tried as a juvenile on less serious charges. Scroll down for video . Tried as an adult: Mugshot of Jenna Montgomery who is accused of luring the victim. Accused: Blue Christian James Kalmbach (left) and Jess Taylor (right) are being held on a $3 million bail bond . Police now suspect the foursome launched the gruesome attack, which took place on February 10 behind a house in Southeast Portland, in a bid to steal the victim's skateboard and cash. Police also suggested the victim had been perceived as a bully and the four saw the attack as retaliation. The victim, told police he was lured to the shed by Miss Montgomery, a fellow David Douglas High School student, who he had met earlier in the day. Murrain said he was invited to meet the girl at Southeast 122nd Avenue and Powell Boulevard, according to prosecutor Christopher Ramras. Jenna Montgomery allegedly told police that she and the three other accused concocted the plan the night before the attack and agreed that she would be 'the bait' Scene: The shed where the violent assault occurred, which is behind a house in southeast Portland. Four teens have been charged . Police have said they are struggling to determine a motive for why the teens allegedly lured Dustin Murrain to this shed and brutally attacked him . When he did, she then walked him to a nearby home and he followed her into the shed in the backyard. There, he was confronted by three other boys. According to Murrain's account, he was struck in the back of the head with a silver crowbar once he entered the shed. He also was ordered to take off his shirt. Once . Murrain removed his shirt, one of the teens, identified as Blue . Christian Kalmbach, 15, is accused of shooting Murrain in the chest, the . groin and index finger with a BB gun. Kalmbach . is then accused of using a box cutter to carve a 'swastika-shaped . insignia' into Murrain's forehead, according to the court affidavit. When Murrain questioned what his attackers wanted, they demanded he return with a skateboard and money, the affidavit said. They rifled through his pockets and stole his iPod, the papers said. Murrain managed to escape and fled to a nearby auto service shop for assistance. He was taken to OHSU Hospital for treatment. Police then located the suspects at 3266 S.E. 111th Ave. Freaky: A Facebook photo of Jenna Jean Montgomery. The 15-year-old allegedly admitted to police she and three other boys had concocted the plan and that she was 'the bait' Horrific: The teens stand accused of using a boxcutter, similar to this one, to carve a swastika-like insignia into the head of Dustin Murrain . The 15-year-old girl told investigators that she and the boys had concocted the scheme the night before and that she was to be the 'bait' to lure Murrain to the shed, the affidavit said. 'She stated that they had all discussed a plan to lure him over to torture him,' the affidavit said. Kalmbach, in an interview with police detectives, admitted he had shot Murrain in the chest and groin, carved a swaskika into his forehead and had forced him to eat cat feces, the affidavit said. Montgomery, Kalmbach, Jess Taylor, 17, and the 14-year-old, were arrested last week, accused of second-degree assault, first-degree kidnapping, criminal conspiracy to commit first-degree kidnapping and first-degree robbery. The four were booked into Donald E. Long juvenile detention about 4 pm on February 10 and appeared the next day before family law Multnomah County Circuit Court Kathryn Villa-Smith in Juvenile Court. Each entered not guilty pleas to the allegations. The 14 year-old's case will remain in juvenile court, but the older teens will be prosecuted as adults for the Measure 11 offenses. Ramras said he didn't know the motive in the crime, or if Murrain knew the three boys. Murrain was rushed to OHSU Hospital for treatment after finally fleeing the shed . The shed was behind a home where the 14 year-old was living with his grandparents, Ramras said. East Precinct Capt. Dave Hendrie said the case was disturbing, even to longtime officers. 'It was shocking enough that even 20-year veterans were like, 'Wow'... that's just another level'"" of violence that they're not used to seeing,' Hendrie said. A grand jury is hearing the case and is expected to return an indictment by Tuesday. The victim's mother, Kelli Murrain, told KPTV she's worried her son will never get over the incident. 'He's been severely traumatized not just physically, but emotionally,' she said. 'It's something he's gonna live with forever, especially if the scar of swastika doesn't go away. Every time he looks in the mirror he's gonna have that memory. 'I'm almost ready to lose faith in humanity at some point, you know, all of this evil is running around, and with our youth.

Shares of Facebook slipped Thursday morning after the world's biggest social networking site surprised Wall Street by spending $19 billion on the messaging service WhatsApp. Analysts that follow the company had mixed feelings on the deal, which Sterne Agee called strategically sound. But Pacific Crest Securities said it would have preferred to see Facebook grow organically, or at least act sooner on such acquisitions to avoid the sticker shock. WhatsApp is a global messaging service for smartphones. It allows users chat with their phone contacts, both one-on-one and in groups, and well the sending of texts, photos, videos and voice recordings. Scroll down for video . Boom: The free instant messaging service created in 2009 has grown faster than Facebook in its five years, and now has more than 450million monthly users around the world . Facebook said Wednesday that it's paying $12 billion in stock and $4 billion in cash for the company. In addition, the app's founders and employees will be granted restricted stock worth $3 billion that will vest over four years after the deal closes. The size of the deal dwarfs acquisitions made by other technology companies, such as Google's $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility or Microsoft's $8.5 billion acquisition of Skype. Sterne Agee Arvind Bhatia said that WhatsApp comes with a large and rapidly growing user base that has a higher percentage of daily active users than Facebook. Pacific Crest's Evan Wilson, however, said that it is hard to justify the valuation of both Facebook and WhatsApp if the social network does face significant competition from mobile messaging services. He noted that the company's acquisition of Instagram, its reported offer for Snapchat and the WhatsApp deal signify that it does. Shares of Facebook Inc. slipped 2 percent, or $1.38, to $66.68 Thursday about a half hour before markets opened. But the shares are still up more than 20 percent this year. Proud moment: Jan Koum, pictured at a digital conference in January, described the deal as 'incredible' On Wednesday, Facebook announced it had snapped up the mobile messaging service WhatsApp for up to $19 billion in cash and stock in the firms biggest ever acquisition. Facebook says it is keeping WhatsApp as a separate service, just as it did with Instagram, which it bought for about $715.3 million. 'The acquisition supports Facebook and WhatsApp's shared mission to bring more connectivity and utility to the world by delivering core internet services efficiently and affordably,' the social network said. WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly active users. In comparison, Twitter had 241 million users at the end of 2014. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says WhatsApp is on path to reach a billion users. 'The combination of WhatsApp and Facebook will allow us to connect many more people round the world,' Zuckerberg said. 'We want to develop more mobile experiences like Instagram and Messenger. 'WhatApp fits this vision perfectly, it has incredibly strong engagement and growth.' 'It's the only app we've ever seen that has grown more quickly than Facebook itself.' 'Their product roadmap is very exciting and won't change. More...

Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's co-founder and chief executive has paid $19 billion for WhatsApp in a move which has taken Wall Street by surprise . As part of the deal, WhatsApp co-founder and Chief Executive Jan Koum will join Facebook's board, and the social network will grant an additional $3 billion worth of restricted stock units to WhatsApp's founders, including Koum. Facebook promised to keep the WhatsApp brand and service, and pledged a $1 billion cash break-up fee were the deal to fall through. WhatsApp will remain based in Mountain View, Calif., and Facebook said its own messenger app and WhatsApp's core messaging product will continue to operate as separate applications . Shares in Facebook slid 5 percent to $64.70 after hours, from a close of $68.06 on the Nasdaq. Facebook was advised by Allen & Co, while WhatApp has enlisted Morgan Stanley for the deal. The deal is the latest aquisition for Facebook, which last year bought Instagram. It also reportedly offered to pay close to $3 billion or more to acquire messaging service Snapchat, though that offer was spurned by the site's founders. Zuckerberg said WhatsApp would operate in the same way as Instagram, as a separate firm. WhatsApp in numbers . 'It would be pretty stupid of us to interfere,' he said. He also said he was not planning to put ads on the service. 'Our strategy is to grow and connect people. 'Once we get to 2-3 billion people there are ways we can monetise. 'Now we want to focus on growing users. I don't think ads are the right way here.' Koum also pledged not to add ads to WhatsApp, which makes money from a subscription model. 'We think advertising is not the way to go - we create a direct relationship with customers,' said Koum. 'We want to make the product better, faster and more efficient.' Experts say the deal could help Facebook attract teens. Professor Will Stewart from the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) said: 'Obviously WhatsApp adds instant messaging to Facebook which must strengthen their position for the moment. 'Equally, all app types rise and fade, so established social media formats like Facebook will be overtaken by something new, and picking up candidates that might have ultimately replaced them may be a good survival strategy for a while. 'This does show the growing significance of mobile, though of course Facebook is on mobile anyway.

During this time Japan was still under the policy of political and cultural isolation, which means the books offer a glimpse of Japanese cuisine from the era, largely unadulterated by foreign influence. The Complete Box of 100 Secrets for Cooking Daikon Radish provided instructions on how to prepare this elaborate radish chain . A modern attempt at the radish chain, shows the elaborate linking technique . These books show that when it comes to cooking, many things have stayed the same. An emphasis on elaborate presentation was just as important in 18th century Japan as it is today, as can be seen with the radish chain. Much like recipe books today, the Japanese cookbooks have titles designed to sell, such as The Complete Box of 100 Secrets for Cooking Daikon Radish and the hyperbolically titled, The Box of 10,000 Secret Cooking Treasures, which does not deliver 10,000 secrets, as promised, but does publish 103 egg recipes, including one for a reversed-egg dish with a yellow outer layer and white yolk.

But scientists in California now believe they act more like teeth-baring monkeys. The researchers claim that primate social networks could provide valuable lessons that will help predict and prevent future financial crisis. The study at the University of California argues that captive rhesus macaque monkeys and bankers both take part in comprise complex networks. The study at the University of California argues that captive rhesus macaque monkeys (left) and bankers (illustrated, right) both take part in complex social networks that mirror each other . Researchers propose that crises are sometimes caused by breakdowns in these internal networks rather than by external factors. They argue that catastrophic collapses could be avoided by monitoring changes in these complex and often mysterious internal structures. ‘Admittedly, comparing monkeys to a financial system is unconventional, however, we believe the comparison is compelling,’ said Fushing Hsieh, a professor of statistics and the study’s lead author. ‘We argue that it’s possible to detect when a crisis is likely to set in - whether in a primate social group or an industry like banking - by modeling the evolution of the breakdowns across the system’s networks,’  said co-author Óscar Jordà. 'There may not be much teeth-baring in the banking industry, however we did determine that interbank lending would be the network in that system that is of comparable importance to subordination signalling in a monkey colony,' Professor McCowan said . A chimpanzee in Russia has been shown to outperform 94 per cent of Russia's investment funds with her portfolio growing by three times in one year. Several years ago, Moscow TV reported how circus chimp Lusha chose eight companies from a possible 30 to invest her one million roubles - around £21,000. The money-wise ape was given cubes representing different companies and asked: 'Lusha where would you like to invest your money this year?' Pausing briefing to think, she then picked out her eight cubes. Lusha's top picks included banks where shares soon rose a stunning 600 per cent after large-scale support from the Kremlin to weather the crisis. She missed out on telecommunications which scored a 240 per cent profit, but went for mining companies, up 150 per cent. The researchers first examined the power structure and significant points, or nodes, that comprise the networks in the monkey social group and applied them to comparable networks in the banking industry. For example, the networks in a community of captive monkeys are based on behaviours such as mutual grooming, fighting, assisting in fights and displaying status signals such as teeth-baring. In the banking industry, the primary activities revolve around interbank lending, loan syndication, bond-issuing services and insurance. The researchers determined that the most important activities within each system are those that influence other relationships. In monkey society, for instance, teeth-baring and other status behaviour that signal who is the boss comprise the ‘main network’ because they govern close, long-term relationships and aggression between individual monkeys. ‘There may not be much teeth-baring in the banking industry, however we did determine that interbank lending would be the network in that system that is of comparable importance to subordination signalling in a monkey colony,’ Professor McCowan said. These main networks are critically important because they significantly influence the stability of other relationships or networks within each respective system, she said. The researchers argue that by looking at changes in the connectivity patterns within the main network, it’s possible to measure growing disturbances within the system, detect a mounting problem.","Scientists say bankers act in some ways like rhesus macaque monkeys .

Mr Rea, 44, claims to have glimpsed the 6ft predator swimming in the river and immediately alerted police to the sighting. But, despite a comprehensive search, officers were unable to find any trace of the large reptile . Mr Rea first spotted the creature under Coronation Bridge, in Bristol, at around 9.05am at the beginning of February (stock picture) Now the Wessex Connect driver, who has endured teasing from friends, workmates and family, has described his 'terrifying discovery'. Mr Rea said he underwent a voluntary drugs test to prove he was not high at the time. He said: 'When I was in my 20s I went to Florida and I saw alligators so I know exactly what they look like. 'There was no mistaking the crocodile and I am still convinced that is what I saw. 'I know there are some people who don’t believe that there was a crocodile in the River Avon but I know what I saw. 'You could see the sections of its back sticking out of the water. 'The river was very high that day which meant that it was deep enough for the crocodile to swim in the middle of the river. Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Nick Gargan wrote on Twitter that officers 'can't find it' after Mr Rea reported the 'sighting' The six-foot reptile was reportedly seen lurking in the river which is around 500ft away from a nursery and 1,000ft away from a secondary school . 'I had plenty of time so I got a really good look at it and it looked like a crocodile to me.' Mr Rea first spotted the creature under Coronation Bridge, in Bristol, at around 9.05am at the beginning of February. 'I was stuck in the traffic and I happened to look in my wing mirror when I saw it,' he said. 'I could see about two feet of its back sticking out of the water and I knew straight away what I was looking at.' He said there were around four or five passengers on the bus at the time but they were all listening to devices and he could not get out of his seat to attract their attention. He added: 'I had to wait until I could stop the bus and then I managed to get the attention of a female police officer. 'She laughed when I told her what I had seen but she said that she would report it. 'It was only later in the day when the Chief Constable went on Twitter and told everyone that all the fuss started. 'I knew people would take the mickey out of me but I would do the same thing again if I had to.

Officers quickly established that Bristol Zoo, which is two miles away from where the ‘croc’ was spotted, was not missing any animals. Just a day later, officers - in full riot gear - launched a second hunt after another sighting was reported in Eastville Park across the city - but this turned out to be a hoax. A second sighting of the alleged crocodile came a week later from mother-of-three Kelly Gray, 41, of Bishopsworth, who said she saw the beast as she drove past the entrance to St Mary Redcliffe School.

'We thought we were goners':  Gillian and Paul Mason, from Blackburn, were told they were 'seconds away from death' after an arsonist lit the fires . A British couple have revealed how flight attendants told them they were seconds from death after a mystery passenger tried to start three fires on their plane home from Australia. Gillian and Paul Mason, from Blackburn, Lancashire, feared for their lives after the toilets were twice set ablaze on the Etihad Airways flight from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. Crew members battled to put out the fires at 35,000ft as the captain made an emergency diversion to Jakarta, Indonesia. Passengers pleaded to get off the plane, but after a one-hour security check by Indonesian authorities the journey resumed - only for three more fires to be started. Flight attendants told Mr Mason, 61, and his wife, 60, that the jet was just 90 seconds away from bursting into flames and plummeting into the Pacific Ocean. Mrs Mason described the ordeal as 'the worst experience of her life' and said she was stunned they were allowed to carry on flying after the first spate of fires. 'It feels like an absolute miracle that the plane didn't go down and it was a massive relief to be able to get into the airport when we arrived in Abu Dhabi,' she said. 'We were actually told that the plane would have burst into flames if it had been spotted 90 seconds later. 'It was very quiet and all of a sudden I could smell burning and the staff flew down the aisle to see what was going on but it was obvious there was some sort of fire. 'It took a couple of fire extinguishers to put it out and we thought it was all under control. 'But not long after it happened again and there was quite a lot of panic on the plane by this point because we had no idea what was going on. 'The captain announced over the tannoy that there had been two serious security breaches and I noticed on the map that our plane had changed course. 'Shortly after that there was another announcement to say we were diverting to Jakarta and that security forces were going to check the plane over.' The plane landed in the Indonesian capital to allow security teams to hunt down the culprit while the passengers were sent through metal detectors and had their hand luggage searched. Officials then gave the go-ahead for the flight to get back on course to Abu Dhabi, but the culprit was still on board. Mrs Mason added: 'We had no idea if anyone had actually been arrested and I felt it was a huge gamble to let us take off again given what had happened. 'When we eventually set off for Abu Dhabi, it happened again and I just thought we were goners - I couldn't let go of my husband's hand.' 'The worst experience of my life': Mrs Mason and her husband were returning home from a month-long stay with her sister in Tasmania, Australia, when they found themselves on a plane with the pyromaniac . The couple had been on the way home to Blackburn after enjoying a month-long holiday at the home of Mrs Mason's sister, Anne, in Tasmania, Australia. 'It's strange trying to come to terms with the fact we were only seconds away from crashing into the sea,' added Mrs Mason, a recently retired teacher. 'We're just both relieved that everyone on board was okay and that we're back at home.' Not always a dance on roses: One passenger, pro golfer Caroline Martens, took to Instagram to complain about the flight, which was forced to land in Jakarta after two fires were lit in the cabin toilets in mid-air . Etihad Airways said staff had launched an investigation into the fire once the plane landed in Indonesia, but allowed it to depart after the captain issued 'strict movement conditions' A spokesman said: 'A comprehensive investigation into the incidents onboard EY 461 from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi on February 17 is still underway. 'The aircraft was searched and released shortly after arrival at Abu Dhabi when it was confirmed it was safe to do so. 'Etihad Airways is co-operating fully in this investigation. Distressing flight: Etihad cabin crew put the plane on lock down due to the fires and people were unable to leave their seats and no food was served for the last part of the journey. (Stock image) 'This follows a precautionary diversion to Jakarta where a security assessment of the situation was conducted with local authorities after smoke was detected in two of the toilets. 'The decision was made to resume the flight after a security search of the aircraft, passengers and their carry-on luggage. 'To further ensure the safety of passengers and crew, the captain implemented strict controls over passenger movement in the cabin, particularly passenger access to the toilets. 'The normal service was suspended to allow cabin crew to monitor and ensure the security of the cabin.'","Gillian and Paul Mason were travelling home to Blackburn from Australia .

A major analysis of 51 million English language tweets revealed that one in 13 contains a curse. Researchers were also able to rank the most popular words, finding f**k was the most popular - and the top seven accounted for over 90% of offensive tweets. The most popular curse words on Twitter: Researchers examined a random one-month sample of 51 million English-language tweets from 14 million distinct user accounts . People curse more and more as the day passes, reaching a peak at 12 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. just before they go to bed, the researchers found. They also found people swore earlier in the week - Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays contained the most curse words relative to tweet volume. 'It’s a sizable fraction of the words we use,' Wenbo Wang, a PhD researcher at Wright State University who led the study, told Fastco. 'On average, one tweet out of 13 tweets will contain at least one cursing word,' 'Because of social media, people don’t see each other. 'They can say things they wouldn’t say in the physical world.' The team at Wright State University examined a random one-month sample of 51 million English-language tweets from 14 million distinct user accounts. They found that we curse more on Twitter than in real life, but tend to use only a few words. 'We found that the curse words occurred at the rate of 1.15% on Twitter, and 7.73% of all the tweets in our dataset contained curse words,' the team wrote in their paper, which was presented this week at the ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing. 'We also found that seven most frequently used curse words accounted for more than 90% of all the cursing occurrences.' The team say they wanted to find out it we cursed more on Twitter. 'Cursing is not uncommon during conversations in the physical world: 0.5% to 0.7% of all the words we speak are curse words, given that 1% of all the words are first-person plural pronouns (e.g., we, us, our),' the researchers wrote. Lack of imagination: The top seven curse words accounted for 90% of all curses, the researchers found . 'On social media, people can instantly chat with friends without face-to-face interaction, usually in a more public fashion and broadly disseminated through highly connected social network.' They also classified the cursing, and identified five different emotions from tweets - anger, joy, sadness, love, and thankfulness. 'Based on the classification results, we found that cursing on Twitter was . most closely associated with two negative emotions: sadness and anger. 'However, curse words could also be used to emphasize positive emotions such as joy or love.' Other insights in the paper involved timing, location, gender, and level of influence of the tweeters. People curse more and more as the day passes, reaching a peak at 12 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. before bedtime, and Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays contain the most curse words relative to tweet volume. Researcher say the hour before we go to sleep is when we are most likely to swear in a tweet . They also found user swore less when talking directly to another user. 'Our study of the relation between cursing and message types suggests that users perform self-censorship when they talk directly to other users. 'We find that users do curse more in relaxed environments, but the differences across different environments are very small, partly due to the fact that Twitter messages are posted in virtual digital world. They also found men tended to swear more. 'Men curse more than women, men overuse some curse words different from what women use and vice versa, and both men and women are more likely to curse in the same-gender contexts.

Britain's favourite dish, fish and chips, faces a sharp rise in price as the recent storms cause the wholesale price of fish to go up by more than 40 per cent. Fishing vessels across the UK's coasts have been unable to set sail because of the stormy weather, stopping supply and pushing up fish prices. Because of this, the price of a portion of fish and chips has gone up 10 per cent, around 35 pence per portion. A person buying a simple portion of fish and chips can expect to pay 35 pence more due to recent storms . Wholesalers are being forced to pay 40 per cent more for haddock, plaice and whiting caught in the Atlantic ocean. Other species of fish have been nearly impossible to catch, and as a result some fish markets have been left completely bare. The president of the National Federation of Fishmongers, Jonathan Adams,  said: 'The price of fish is always affected by the weather - when it goes up, consumers must expect to pay as much as 10 per cent more. 'Obviously not many people who do fish . and chips actually use fresh fish any more but those who do will have . probably had an increase of about £3 per kilo. The difficulty in catching fish in stormy weather has meant that fishmongers have had to pay more for the fish that they sell, thus making the fish we buy more expensive . 'That would probably work out at about an extra 35p per portion of fish. 'Buyers have had about a 30-40 per cent price increase recently and some things have been virtually impossible to get hold of. 'When I went to Brixham fish market the other week they had absolutely no produce available for just the second time in ten years. 'It should be back down again within the next couple of weeks, I guess it all depends on what happens next.' The price of popular white fish often used in the British staple, such as cod and haddock, have gone up dramatically over the last 12 months. The price of haddock has risen by 54 per cent to £1,474 a tonne, and plaice has risen 51 per cent to £1,246 a tonne. Fishing boats have had to contend with treacherous conditions due to the abnormally stormy winter weather . But now, because of bad weather, the popular British seaside meal could be under more jeopardy. Fishmonger Malcom Smith said: 'Usually fishing boats go out for five to seven days but they have only been able to get out for a day or two because of the bad weather down in Cornwall and Devon. 'Prices can fluctuate by up to 35 per cent in just seven days but we try to even out the prices throughout the year so that we don’t shock the customers. 'The prices are starting to come down again now because there are more fish in the system. Things will improve week on week. 'Fish are a bit like the stock market. It is the only product these days that is still auctioned. They sell for the price that buyers want to pay.' The government body Seafish has reassured people that the brunt of the bad weather price rises will be taken on by the business owners until the price drops back down. In addition, while many prices have been on the rise, fish like bream and sea bass have remained fixed due to the UK fish farming industry.","UK fish prices have gone up due to stormy conditions affecting boats .

From Hungerford to Blackfriars and Westminster to Millennium, the exhibition also looks at how London¿s bridges allow people to move around and experience the city. This photograph of the rush hour, taken from the south side of London Bridge was taken by Barry Lewis in 1978 . Earth has not anything to show more fair:Dull would he be of soul who could pass byA sight so touching in its majesty:This City now doth like a garment wearThe beauty of the morning: silent, bare,Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lieOpen unto the fields, and to the sky,All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.Never did sun more beautifully steepIn his first splendour valley, rock, or hill;Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!The river glideth at his own sweet will:Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;And all that mighty heart is lying still!

British architect Sir Norman Foster's Millennium Bridge is pictured . The combined bascule (drawbridge) and suspension bridge that crosses the River Thames was built between 1886 and 1894. The bridge is 800ftt (244m) in length with two towers each 213ft (65m) high, built on piers. The central span of 200ft (61m) between the towers is split into two equal bascules, which can be raised to an angle of 86 degrees to allow river traffic to pass. The bridge consists of two towers tied together at the upper level by means of two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower. It was officially opened on 30 June 1894 by The Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII), and his wife. Its present colour scheme dates from 1977, when it was painted red, . white and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's silver jubilee. Originally it . was painted a mid greenish-blue colour. Five companies built the bridge, which cost £1,184,000 at the time, or £114million in today's money. Two massive piers, containing over 70,000 tons of concrete were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction. Over 11,000 tons of steel provided the framework for the towers and walkways. This was then clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone, both to protect the underlying steelwork and to give the bridge a pleasing appearance. The original raising mechanism was steam-powered but was largely replaced in 1974 by a new electro-hydraulic drive system.

A woman who left her dog to starve for so long that it started eating its own faeces has been banned for keeping animals for 20 years. Stacey Moran, 27, from Coatbridge, Scotland, admitted failing to provide proper care for her two-year-old cross breed Sasha. When SPCA workers found the dog, she was locked in a filthy room covered in rubbish and excrement, with no available food or water. Sasha, a cross breed, was found by the SPCA locked in a filthy room littered with rubbish and excrement with no food or water . She was so malnourished that her ribs were sticking out under her fur and she weighed just 10lb, when she should have weighed 15lb. Stacey Moran, 27, has been banned from keeping animals for 20 years after the shocking neglect was discovered . Incredibly Moran tried to claim she had been away on holiday and left the dog in the care of a family member, and that they had neglected Sasha. However an inspection by vets found that the level of malnutrition had developed over a much longer period. Sasha was given a body score of just 1.5, with one being malnourished and five being obese. Inspector Sam MacDonald said: 'Thankfully, Sasha made a full recovery in our care, gaining 2.35kg through simple, adequate feeding and we were delighted to find her a loving new home with a responsible owner. 'We are pleased Moran received a 20-year ban for the suffering she caused Sasha. She gave no reasonable explanation for Sasha's condition and therefore we considered this to be a case of gross neglect.' Moran was sentenced at Airdrie Sheriff Court yesterday after pleading guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to her dog under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006. In another case of animal cruelty, last month a cruel owner dumped a puppy in a hedge on a freezing night with a note around its neck which read: 'Please look after me as my owner doesn't want me'. Moran claimed she had been on holiday and left Sacha in the care of family who mistreated her, when in fact Moran kept her locked in a room in this flat block . Sacha, who has been renamed twink, has now been rehomed after being brought up to a healthy weight . The 14-month-old spaniel-pointer cross was locked in a cage and left in a bush by the roadside near Downham Market, Norfolk. Luckily, a passer-by found the abandoned pet before he starved or froze to death, after hearing his yelps for help from the undergrowth. Attached around his neck was the note, written in a childish scrawl, which continued: 'I'll try to do my best to keep you happy. My name is Snoopi.'","Sasha, a cross breed, was found locked in a filthy room .

'BANG!': Robin Clark, 44, slipped and re-opened his leg wound after colleagues played a prank on him . A City broker who was shot in the leg by a balaclava-wearing gunman ended up in hospital again after a cruel joke on his first day back at work. Robin Clark, 44, needed hospital treatment after pranksters sneaked up behind him and shouted 'bang!'. He fell over and re-opened his leg wound from the shock. Mr Clark, dubbed 'The Wolf of Shenfield' in light of his City boy lifestyle, was blasted in the thigh with a shotgun at close range by an unknown attacker last month in the car park of an Essex train station. As he recovered in hospital from the initial shooting, where he was given armed police guards, Mr Clark said he had 'no idea why someone would want to hurt me like this.' RP Martin, the firm where Mr Clark works, declined to comment on the incident. He is understood to have returned to work. British Transport Police have made no arrests in the case, though they said that they are investigating and have no doubt that Mr Clark was deliberately targeted. The gunman approached Mr Clark at 5.55am on Friday January 24 in the car park of Shenfield station. Using a sawn-off shotgun, he fired once at point-blank range, leaving a fist-sized wound. Surgeons later said that the blast was just inches from severing major arteries in Mr Clark's leg. Speaking from his hospital bed to The Sun after his attack, he said he through he was going to die. He told the paper: 'I said a quick prayer because I thought this was going to be the end. I thought I was going to bleed to death before any help would come.' Famous folk: Mr Clark has been pictured . alongside celebrities and models, such as Nancy Sorrell, left, and race . driver Lewis Hamilton, right . Mr . Clark, a twice-divorced father-of-four, last year rented out his . £2.2million five-bedroom house in nearby Ingatestone after running into . debt. After the incident, pictures emerged of his lavish lifestyle, where he was pictured next to Formula One drivers and models in a previous job. While working in the U.S., Mr Clark had brought in salaries as high as £1million a year after being appointed to a senior position on a huge financial merger. However, friends said the broker had been suffering money worries in more recent years, and was saddled with debts. Last year a . county court judgment was filed against him for debts of £14,653, and he . was director of a number of companies that were shut down while owing . money. The day before the shooting Mr Clark had tried to sell his Range Rover for £10,000. Scene: Armed officers from Essex Police scoured the scene last month at Shenfield station .

Hurn, from Stowmarket in Suffolk, said Mr Clark had been a ‘prolific car . buyer’ until he went through a ‘messy divorce’ around 18 months ago. Over the past few years he had bought a number of expensive cars including Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Maseratis. Mr . Hurn said: ‘His great love is classic cars and particularly Porsches.

If you are bored of the plethora of copycat Flappy Bird games appearing in app stores and are growing tired of the addictive original, you could harness your creativity and make your own version of game. That's just what one New York-based hacker did by building a DIY shoebox version of the best-selling app using a handful of basic electrical components. Fawn Qiu used an Arduino sensor, two servo motors, a reed switch and magnets, all hidden inside a cardboard box to create her mechanical marvel. Scroll down for video . Flappy Bird caused a sensation after rising out of obscurity to become one of the most downloaded mobile games on both Apple and Google's online stores. Users have to steer a bird between green pipes. The Android version was downloaded up to 50 million times, and attracted more than half a million reviews. It also topped the Apple download charts, although figures have not been released for the iOS version. But of course she also had to use her artistic skills too to make the coloured backdrop for the game. The U.S.-based engineer and founder of Make Anything put the project together to prove that it is possible for most people to engineer their own version of the game, Sploid reported. The clever mechanism means that the Flappy Bird scenery rolls and rolls as a player dodges the green tubes by tapping on the sensitive pad – a little like gamers tap on their smartphone screen. If players make a mistake and hit a tube, it's game over and the lid of the shoebox slams shut so that they have to start afresh. Demonstrating the continuing demand for the game, one viewer of Ms Qiu’s YouTube video that shows people playing on the bulky game said: ‘If you’re selling this, I’ll buy it’. Following the sudden disappearance of the original Flappy Bird app on Apple and Google’s app stores, imitations of Flappy Bird popped up everywhere, after its creator confirmed that the original game is ‘gone forever’. Nguyen Ha Dong, the developer who pulled his highly successful and profitable app, revealed he did so because he thinks it was too addictive. The Vietnamese Hanoi-based developer is believed to have walked away from a small fortune as it is estimated he could have made $50,000 every day in in-app advertising alone. Fawn Qiu used an Arduino sensor, two servo motors, a reed switch and magnets, all hidden inside a cardboard box to create her mechanical marvel (pictured) He told Forbes that he created the app - which saw players tapping on their smartphone screen to navigate a pixelated birds though narrow pipes - to be played in a few minutes, in his first interview since he took his game away. It happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem,’ he said. ‘To solve that problem, it’s best to take down Flappy Bird. It’s gone forever.’ Flappy Bird was the most popular free mobile game on Apple App Store and Google's Android Play store.

A super morbidly obese woman who underwent risky weight loss surgery in a bid to help her regain her life, has failed to lose weight, despite saying her size makes her feel like she's dead. Penny Saeger, 46 years old, from Atlanta, Georgia  has spent her last 4 years living in her hospital bed. Weighing in at 530lb or 37 stone, Penny’s size confines her to her bed totally forcing her to rely on her husband for even basic needs, and meaning her ability to mother her young son is severely restricted. Scroll down for video . Penny, who weighs 530lb, has been bed bound four over four years . ‘I started out like everybody else, but every time I had a problem it . would be one pound, two pounds, five pounds, and it just kept going. I . let food be the way which I found solace. ‘Sometimes . it feels like I’m dead. I cannot do the things that other people take . for granted. My bed is my bathroom, my dinner table, my world. I might . as well be a prisoner in jail. Food addiction has become my life.’ Despite . this, Penny refused to follow the diet after a risky gastric . bypass surgery, meaning she remains super morbidly obese. After marrying her husband, Edgar, Penny had four miscarriages before giving birth to her first son, Liam. Penny's ability to care for her son Liam is restricted by her size. She has to experience much of his life through pictures or videos sent to her in her bed . Shortly after Liam was born, Penny’s weight forced her to become bed ridden, making Edgar the primary care-giver for her and her son. ‘Even as early as third grade I knew I was heavier, and I remember . in fourth grade I started having to wear plus sizes and I hated that. 'I just gained about 20lb a year, I ended up being close to 300lb by the time I was 22 or so. 'My weight is very near 600 at this time. My world has closed in around me.’ Penny experiences Liam’s life through technology, seeing  him arrive for his first day at school through pictures sent on her iPhone and participating in family dinners through Skype as she sits on her bed, eating. Though Penny does help take care of Liam, her care is confined to what can be done with her remaining in her bed. Penny is transported inside her own home carried on a blanket. Her and her family traveled to Houston, Texas so she could receive risky weight loss surgery . ‘If he refused to come into my bubble then I wouldn’t be able to help him,’ she says. Husband Edgar, who bathes and cooks for Penny as well as helping her in going to the loo without leaving the bed, says: ‘Her weight has affect us in many ways. I have to go to all the school functions. Liam does tai kwon do and she has never actually seen him, I’ve had to video him.' Growing up with an abusive father, Penny continued to gain weight and found that her body was a defense tool that she could use to protect herself and her two sisters. Her weight continued to climb and as a young adult, Penny found herself to be over 400-lbs and admitted to having a food addiction. Her sisters Christina and Angela say they believe Penny’s distorted relationship with food began in childhood, when they witnessed their mother being physically abused by their father. It takes an entire of people, including the local fire department, to help get Penny off her bed and out of her house . ‘Penny was the oldest and she probably experienced a lot more of it than we did,’ Christina says. ‘She had to bear the brunt of a lot of what we have to go through. It’s not always her fault; the eating now is but a lot of the stuff in our history… she had nobody to tell her yea it’s going to be ok.’ When Edgar and Penny became a couple she was around 420lb and, although large, was able to lead a normal life. While pregnant with their son Liam her weight ballooned to 620lb and after giving birth she struggled to lose the pounds. Penny’s size means the couple haven’t been able to share a bed for years and Edgar became her full time carer, forcing the family to live off disability benefits. Her weight also left her with numerous health problems including diabetes and, desperate to receive the weight loss surgery she believed she needed to save her life, Penny was forced to travel to Houston Texas to find a doctor who specialises in patients at her weight. Penny traveled on a hospital mattress in the back of a van and the local fire department had to help manoeuvre her out of the house. Bypass surgeon Dr Nowzaradan discovers Penny's BMI is 85.7 when she is admitted to the specialist hospital in Texas . Edgar and Penny travelled across the country to see bypass surgeon Dr Nowzaradan. ‘A normal BMI is under 25, over 40 is classed as super morbidly obese. Penny’s BMI is 85.7, that is very big,’ explains Dr Nowzaradan. ‘Penny has a lot of issues; some of them are real and some are imaginary. It seems like she has played the role of being a victim and encouraging family to be enablers. This dynamic is very difficult to break.’ Penny spent a month in hospital under supervision on a strict diet and lost 40lb before undergoing surgery to dramatically reduce the size of her stomach in an attempt to help her eat less. Penny, pictured here with husband Edgar (left) insists she can not walk and is trying hard with her diet, despite gaining weight after the gastric bypass . However following the surgery Penny struggled to readjust her attitude to food, and in particular to get out of bed and start walking – a crucial component of continuing her weight loss. Despite being on a 1,200 calorie a day diet, Penny failed to lose any more weight, leading Dr Nowzaradan to conclude she must have convinced someone to sneak additional food in for her. Three months after the surgery Penny is sent home by the hospital due to her failure to comply with treatment, but she insisted that this was ultimately a good thing. ‘I am going to lose the weight for sure, I just need to be at home with my family,' she says. The family rented an apartment near the hospital to allow Penny to continue receiving treatment at the hospital. Once . at home Penny is provided with a physical therapist to try and help her . walk but she continued to resist and, despite being given detailed . instructions on her strict diet plan, returns to her old unhealthy . eating habits,. Even when a nutritionist visits the home to attempt to help the family improve their diet, Penny remains resistant. Penny spent a month in hospital under supervision on a strict diet and lost 40lb before undergoing surgery to dramatically reduce the size of her stomach . ‘You have no manner of people telling you what you can and can’t do but ultimately the only person who knows what’s best for you is you,’ she justifies. ‘I’m just not able to walk or stand, I know my limitations. The thing is there just wasn’t a diet given to me. There’s only so many popsicles and soups and cream of wheat’s you can eat before you are done with it. ‘I cannot function without wantons (a type of deep fried dough with filling). They’re probably not the best thing for me, but I could eat all of this . (indicating a platter of wantons) and it wouldn’t be as detrimental to . me as not eating.' When she . is readmitted to hospital five months after surgery, Penny has regained . five of the initial 40lb she lost in hospital before surgery. After the surgery Penny's weight loss stalls and Dr Nowzaradan suspects she is having extra food brought into the hospital for her . ‘I think Penny is convincing herself. She is her own worst enemy and her husband is her second worst enemy and they don’t realise this is a dangerous game she’s playing,’ say Dr Nowzaradan. Despite renewing her attempts to lose weight back at home, Penny fails to achieve her goal of being able to walk, and so attend her son Liam’s graduation. Over nine months on from the surgery that drastically reduced the size of her stomach she has not lost weight and remains bed bound. Over nine months on from the surgery that drastically reduced the size of her stomach she has not lost weight and remains bed bound . ‘Penny lives in a false reality where she chooses to over eat but won’t admit it. She has to decide she wants to lose weight and that she wants to walk. But I don’t see any willingness to want to get well,’ Dr Nowzaradan. Eventually Penny decided to leave Texas, terminating her treatment at the hospital, and returns home to Maryland where she feels she feels she will be able to lose weight. ‘Even if I’m not successful in the world’s eyes, the fact that I did all of this so far changed my path in life forever.

"By . Paul Donnelley . PUBLISHED: . 12:53 EST, 20 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:43 EST, 20 February 2014 . An original portrait of Hitler’s mistress Eva Braun that was owned by the woman herself has been discovered. The oil painting that shows her wearing a red hat and a knowing smile is believed to be the official Nazi state portrait. It was created by the artist Hans Lehmkuhl in 1941 and was kept by Eva Braun until 1943 when she gave it to her friend, Countess Antonia Isabelle Clementine, Grafin von Westphalen zu Furstenberg. For sale: This portrait of Eva Braun that she once owned is to be offered for sale. It was lost for 70 years and is expected to sell for £6,000 . Now the 54x49 inch picture is expected to fetch £6,000 when it goes under the hammer at Mullock’s auction rooms in Ludlow, Shropshire. The countess married into the zu Stolberg dynasty and the current owner purchased the painting from the family. The portrait, which comes with documents of provenance, had been lost for 70 years prior to the vendor buying it. Mealtime: Hitler and Eva Braun pictured in the Berchtesgaden. The photograph was never published in her lifetime and was discovered in a photo album belonging to her that was discovered the by the US Army Signal Corps . Secret: Hitler was rarely seen in public with Eva Braun and their first public engagement was in June 1944 when her sister married a member of his staff . Eva Braun met Hitler in October 1929 . when she was 17 and he was 40, and became his mistress two years later . after the death of Geli Raubal. By . 1936 she was part of his household, but did not attend official events . with him until June 1944 and even then only because her sister married . one of Hitler’s staff. In early April 1945, when the war was lost she travelled to be with Hitler and they married shortly before they both committed suicide in his bunker in the Berlin. Portrait: Two views of Hans Lehmkuhl in his later years. He was a favourite of the Nazis although he never belonged to the party . Multi-talent: Hans Lehmkuhl not only painted people he was a talented painter of cities, This is his image of Bremen . Richard Westwood-Brookes, from the saleroom, said: ‘This head and shoulders portrait is a fascinating piece of history and shows Eva Braun in colour. ‘Usually she is seen only in black and white but the painting shows her blonde hair and blue eyes, essential for any wife of Hitler. ‘She is pictured wearing a red hat and a blue jacket and appears to be trying to smile. ‘Her relationship with Hitler was a complicated one and it is clear that she was completely devoted to him. ‘Early in their relationship she twice attempted suicide because of him. ‘Our vendor bought this from the family of the person to whom Eva Braun gave it during the war. ‘It was hidden for many years and now is being offered for sale. There will be great interest in it.’ The German artist was a First World War veteran who, in 1936, was commissioned to paint athletes at the Berlin Olympics. Commissions for top Nazis followed and though never a party member, he remained popular. He worked until his death in 1969. The auction takes place on March 18. The Nazis were obsessed with their image and produced art works to reflect the way they saw themselves – racially pure, obedient and militaristic. Their art sang the praises of home, family and the National Socialist struggle. It bore similarities to the Soviet propaganda art style. Modern art was regarded as elitist, morally suspect and too often incomprehensible and much was regarded as ‘degenerate’ and burned along with books. Hitler favoured Greek and Roman art, which he believed to be both heroic and romantic as well ‘as uncontaminated by Jewish influences’. In July 1937, the Nazis hosted two art exhibitions in Munich – one, the Great German Art Exhibition, showed works that Hitler approved of, while the other met his and state disapproval The . Degenerate Art Exhibition. Hitler was furious when the Degenerate Art Exhibition attracted more than a million visitors, three times as many as the approved art. The paintings that were approved had names such as: Fruitful Land, Liberated Land, Blessing of Earth and Standing Guard. Hitler's favourite painter was Adolf Ziegler and Hitler owned a number of his works. When war came, Nazi art became romanticised, depicting heroic sacrifice and victory.","Oil painting was owned by Braun for two years and then given to a friend .

NBC News anchor Brian Williams made a hasty on-air apology Wednesday after Arsenio Hall mocked him for leaving Hall off a list of late night TV’s power players. ‘Arsenio is a late-night veteran and he took us to task on his show and he even urged his audience members to call our newsroom,’ Williams said on his ‘Nightly News’ telecast from the Winter Olympics in Sochi. The apology came after some less than subtle urging from Hall. He not only encouraged his audience to call the NBC newsroom, but also brought on infamous rap mogul Suge Knight and cracked: ‘Sometimes I take a joke too far.’ Scroll down for video . Oops: NBC News host Brian Williams apologized from Sochi on Wednesday for leaving talk show veteran Arsenio Hall off a list of late night power players--all were white and many far less experienced than Hall . 'Let me be in the middle where Alice used to be': Hall's irritation came from this Brady Bunch-like montage of late night hosts . Hours later, Williams made amends and poked fun at the networks other flubs. ‘So, in apologizing to Arsenio we just wanted to point out: At least you're in good company here,’ Williams said. Williams noted that the newscast last year left New Hampshire off a map and on Tuesday misspelled Philadelphia on-screen. Hall's exclusion came during what he called NBC News' ‘Brady Bunch montage’ showing photos of virtually every late-night TV host, including David Letterman, Chelsea Handler and Carson Daly. Subtle urging: Hall's initial response included jokes about the all-white group in the NBC segment and he urged viewers to call the NBC newsroom . 'We might just be kidding, Brian. You know, sometimes I take the joke too far. Just mention me, man,' Hall joked after infamous rap mogul Suge Knight came onstage making veiled threats . The photo graphic was used on Monday's ‘Nightly News’ segment on ‘The Tonight Show’ debut of Jimmy Fallon, also on NBC. On Tuesday's syndicated ‘The Arsenio Hall Show,’ the host was smiling but clearly irked as he displayed the graphic and called out Williams and journalism in general. ‘If you're doing a story about late-night, all I ask is that you mention me,’ Hall said. ‘You don't even have to use a photo. I know how journalism is these days. Use Samuel Jackson — it doesn't even have to be my photo. Use Laurence Fishburne. Just mention me.’ Hall invoked the names of the two actors who were involved in another recent media mishap: A TV reporter interviewing Jackson apparently confused him with Fishburne. Both are black. Late night vet: Arsenio Hall successfully aired a talk show against late night titan Johnny Carson and drew big name guests that famously included then president Bill Clinton . The late-night landscape is nearly all white, with a few exceptions including Hall and PBS' Tavis Smiley. ‘There's nobody even with a tan,’ Hall said of the montage shown by NBC News. ‘Hall, saying he's the only current late-night host ‘who competed and survived against Johnny . Carson,’ said he had no grudge with his other hosts. Hall's new show debuted in September; his original late-night show aired from 1989 until 1994, when Carson hosted ‘Tonight.’ Saying he didn't want to play the ‘angry black man,’ Hall invited a friend on stage to help out so that Williams and others in journalism would ‘include a brother.’ Marion ‘Suge’ Knight, founder of Death Row Records, suggested that Hall give Williams enough time to respond before making him face the consequences. ‘Change it or resign?’ Hall responded. ‘We might just be kidding, Brian. You know, sometimes I take the joke too far. Just mention me, man.’ Following Williams' apology, Hall offered a graceful acceptance. 'That was a cool way to do,' Hall on his show Wednesday. 'Thanks, Brian! I appreciate it.'","NBC News neglected to include the black veteran talk show host on a list of late night hosts, all of whom were white and many far less experienced .

In the 1988 Hollywood classic Akeem Joffer (Eddie Murphy) is heir to the throne of a fictional African country called Zamunda. Akeem leads a sheltered life inside the palace where his shirts are pressed for him by his servants and he rarely has to lift a finger even to buy his own food. While this lifestyle suits Prince Akeem's parents - King Jaffe (James Earl Jones) and Queen Aeoleon (Madge Sinclair) - his pampered upbringing leaves him frustrated as he is unable to do anything for himself. While he already has misconceptions, the final straw comes when he is introduced to his bride-to-be (Vanessa Bell) in an arranged marriage. Prince Akeem hasn't even met his potential wife and concocts a plan to find his perfect bride in America instead.

New claims: The officer who arrested Justin Bieber has experienced significant disciplinary proceedings over the course of the past 11-years . The Miami Beach police officer who arrested Justin Bieber last month for drag racing has been accused of misconduct 15-times in the past, it has been revealed today. Officer Steven Cosner, who claims that Bieber, 19, was racing at 60 mph long the beach strip last month, has a checkered history that the popstar's lawyers hope will help their clients case should it go to trial. Indeed, Bieber's legal counsel are now working under the assumption that Cosner's claims may even be false - as indicated by claims that the GPS tracking system from the star's Lamborghini shows that in the middle of the alleged race, the maximum top speed of the cars was 27 mph. According to celebrity gossip site, TMZ, Cosner has been investigated by internal affairs repeatedly and has been cited for misconduct 15 times from 2001 to 2012. Out of the 15 times he was accused of misconduct, Cosner failed to show up for court hearings 5 times. And in each of those cases he was reprimanded, with three verbal warnings and two write ups. In 2006, Cosner committed three offenses, which violated the rules of 'courtesy and respect', 'off-duty/secondary employment' and 'unlawful compensation.' He was suspended for these violations. Watch Video Here: . Off the hook? Justin Bieber's defense team hope that the questionable record of Officer Cosner will mean the case does not come to trial . And in 2007, Cosner was accused of offensive conduct and language and this allegation is still open according to TMZ. And, embarrassingly, in 2011, Cosner was cited for sleeping while on duty. And out of the seven remaining cases, Cosner was exonerated by Internal Affairs. Last month, according to  TMZ.com, who claim to have obtained the print-out of the GPS records from the Lamborghini Bieber had rented and was driving at the time of his arrest in Miami last week, the records would have shown a higher driving speed if the 19-year-old had been drag racing his friend Khalil, as police initially claimed. Miami Beach police primarily accused Bieber and Khalil of racing at speeds of between 50 and 60 miles an hour. However, judging by the TMZ print-out, the maximum speed reached by Bieber in the car was 44mph, which was when he left Club Set in Miami Beach at 4.07am, before the speed dropped to a maximum speed of 27mph just two minutes later. The website claim that the significance behind the figures is that the 27mph reading came on the 3700 block of Pine Tree Drive - where the speed limit is 30mph - and that if Bieber had been drag racing at that point, the reading would have been significantly higher. Police had originally claimed they caught sight of the drag race on the 2600 block of the road, before Bieber was pulled over and arrested in the 4100 block. There are also discrepancies in the GPS reading from the Escalade which was reported to have been used to block traffic on Pine Tree Drive to allow the drag race to take place. Watch Video Here: . Location: Police had originally claimed they caught sight of the drag race on the 2600 block of Pine Tree Drive (pictured) before Bieber was pulled over and arrested in the 4100 block . However, the print-out of the GPS show that the vehicle originally stopped outside the club at 2.35am, when Bieber and his dad, who was in the Escalade, headed inside and remained for 1.2 hours. The vehicle isn't registered to have begun moving again until 4.06am, and didn't stop until Bieber was pulled over - dismissing claims that it was used to facilitate the race. TMZ claim that if the GPS records are correct, the figures will cause issues for prosecutors in the case, as it will mean that Bieber's car was pulled over for a reason that doesn't actually exist. Involved: GPS records from the Escalade that Justin's dad Jeremy (pictured) was in also refutes claims that the vehicle had been parked up to facilitate the drag race . Regardless of the GPS records, official toxicology reports from Bieber's arrest show that the singer had marijuana and the active ingredient of Xanax in his system when he was arrested on January 23rd. The star is pleading not guilty to DUI after the arrest. Meanwhile, in the latest alleged criminal episode earlier this week, Justin and five of his entourage are accused of assaulting a limousine driver on December 30 after they were picked up from a nightclub. Toronto police released a statement saying the limo driver and an unnamed passenger had an altercation during which he was hit on the back of the head 'several times'. The charge is yet another in a string of recent run-ins with the law, but if Bieber is convicted of assault, federal law allows that the Canadian could very well be deported and banned from working in the United States. Meanwhile, former Bee Gees star Barry Gibb is the latest person to offer Bieber some advice in the wake of his difficult few weeks. Speaking to Matt Lauren on the Today Show, Barry said: 'Things don't really change much, do they? If you're a teenage idol and all the young girls love you, you can lose that pretty quick. 'You can lose perspective, but you can also lose them in the long run if you're not a role model. Hopefully, what he does on stage and the way he dances and the way he sings, he will apply that to his real life. 'There's a discipline in what he's doing. Apply that discipline to how you want to behave.'","Miami Beach officer who collared Justin Bieber for drag racing under the influence of alcohol has a checkered professional record .

David Moyes is ready to hit Bayern Munich with a bid for contract rebel Toni Kroos after it emerged the Germany midfielder’s wage demand is only half the amount that has been offered to Wayne Rooney. After being watched by Moyes at Borussia Moenchengladbach last Friday night, Kroos admitted there were no plans for further talks on renewing a contract that runs out at the end of next season and he was in the dark over his future. It was thought he was looking for a pay rise that might cause unrest in the Bayern dressing room after chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge admitted talks were deadlocked and ruefully added that it was ‘always about money in these negotiations.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch United target Kroos scoring some Bundesliga beauties . Deal him in: Manchester United are keen to sign £25million-rated Kroos . But Sportsmail understands the figure presented to Allianz Arena bosses is around £150,000 a week, half the weekly £300,000 dangled before Rooney to extend his Old Trafford stay. Kroos evidently believes he is well worth a salary that would edge him nearer top earners like Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Franck Ribery and is prepared to stick to his guns. Though talks have ground to a halt, Bayern are reluctant to sell and will ask at least £25million, should they sense there is a danger of Kroos running down his current deal. On the ball: Man United boss Moyes watched Kroos - who wants parity with Bayern Munich's top earners, including Franck Ribery (R) - in action for the German giants last week against Borussia Moenchengladbach . With United’s midfield still in need of strengthening, even after the arrival of Juan Mata, Moyes is unlikely to be deterred and will surely be encouraged by a clear signal he would have little difficulty keeping Kroos happy on the pay front. Sportsmail exclusively revealed on Saturday that Moyes, and assistants Steve Round and Phil Neville, had been met outside Moenchengladbach’s ground on Friday night by one of Kroos’ advisers, Sascha Breese, who escorted them inside and sat with them throughout the game against Bayern. Sports Total, for whom Breese works, have since tried to play down claims that Kroos could be heading for Old Trafford, but Moyes has promised more significant signings before the window closes and has the 24-year old in his sights.

The singer of indie rock band Bright Eyes is suing a woman for $1million after she accused him of raping her after a concert when she was 16 in a series of online posts. Conor Oberst filed the lawsuit yesterday claiming he was libelled by the woman, who he has identified as Janie Faircloth, who claimed she was sexually assaulted by the singer-songwriter at a 2003 concert. An attorney for Oberst filed the civil lawsuit in a Manhattan federal court, with the legal documents claiming Ms Faircloth was a liar who made 'despicable, false, outrageous, and defamatory statements' about Oberst last December. Legal action: Bright Eyes singer Conor Oberst is suing a woman for $1million after she accused him of raping her when she was 16 . According to Mr Oberst's lawsuit, Ms Faircloth posted accusations on website XOJane.com that the singer songwriter raped her a decade ago in North Carolina after his brother, who was her English teacher at school, introduced the two at one of the singer's concerts. She also accused Mr Oberst of punching her in the face, according to the legal papers, which add that she was 16 at the time. The three comments were written underneath an article about domestic violence for website's It Happened to Me series, and were later shared on other blogs. These posts have since been deleted from the site. Mr Oberst, who lives in Omaha, Nebraska, is best known for his work with Bright Eyes, including song First Day Of My Life.

The 33-year-old musician says the media coverage that resulted from the three posts in the comments section of a blog has damaged his career, especially in New York where most of the major music publishing houses have their headquarters. He says he was in the company of his brother, bandmates or then-girlfriend at the time the claims were made, and the suit also says the woman has made positive social media comments about the guitarist over the last 10 years. According to the lawsuit, Ms Faircloth said in the posts that she never reported the assault because of the way her own family and friends reacted to the accusations. She says she posted his name a decade later to help others and at the suggestion of her husband. Both Mr Oberst's attorney and Ms Faircloth were approached for comment.

The referee who dismissed Cristiano Ronaldo in Real Madrid's draw at Athletic Bilbao last weekend has been suspended amid suggestions he changed his story of the incident. The Spanish League's Refereeing Technical Committee (CTA) has dropped Miguel Angel Ayza Gamez for a month and he has been barred from officiating Real matches this season. According to reports in Spain, there is a real danger he could be demoted from the list of La Liga match officials following his poor handling of the game. Scroll down to read Graham Poll's verdict on the suspension . Rejected: Cristiano Ronaldo's appeal against his three-match suspension has been denied . Dismissed: Ronaldo was sent off in the 75th minute of the 1-1 draw at San Mames, a damaging result in the context of their La Liga title challenge . Bewildered: The Portuguese could scarcely believe he had been sent off . Ronaldo was sent off for the seventh time in his career in the 75th minute of Sunday's 1-1 draw at San Mames after he raised his hand to Bilbao captain Carlos Gurpegi, who fell to the floor theatrically. He also confronted Bilbao midfielder Ander Iturraspe during an ugly melee. Ayza Gamez is understood to have originally stated that he sent Ronaldo off for the incident with Gurpegi but then changed his story to say he had dismissed him for pushing Iturraspe - a fracas the Bilbao player started. Valencia born referee Ayza Gamez has a reputation in Spain for being consistently poor. For the last three seasons he has finished far enough down the refereeing authority's end of season's rankings that he has been a major candidate to be relegated to the second tier. He doesn't have the arrogance of several of his even more unpopular colleagues and is liable to be pressured into making mistakes by players rather than erring because of an exaggerated desire to be the focus of every game - but he is seen as incompetent all the same. He fell over in the Athletic Bilbao vs Real Madrid game last weekend and that fits his reputation for not being in control. He is also criticized for lacking the character needed to officiate in the top flight. Madrid have complained previously over his failure to send Dani Alves for dissent in a match where he had booked the full-back but then allowed him to call him 'loco' (crazy) to his face. PETE JENSON . Squaring up: Ronaldo argues with Bilbao midfielder Ander Iturraspe, sparking a melee involving a number of players from both sides . Trouble: Ronaldo puts his head into the face of Iturraspe having swiped his hand across the face of Bilbao captain Carlos Gurpegi (left) Scrap: Ronaldo postures as the players square up to each other . Ronaldo has been banned for three matches and will miss his team's forthcoming fixtures against Villarreal, Getafe and Elche - a major blow in Real's bid to beat rivals Atletico Madrid and Barcelona to the title. The Portuguese, who turned 29 on Wednesday, was banned for one match for violent conduct and a further two matches for dissent as he walked from the field. He was also fined just under £1,000. However, the news that Ayza Gamez has been suspended will encourage Real in their appeal against Ronaldo's ban. The innocent one: Ronaldo stands back as the arguments carry on . Long walk off: Ronaldo leaves the pitch after being shown a straight red card . The Spanish Football Federation's Appeals Committee convenes on Friday to consider their argument. Ronaldo, the Ballon d'Or winner who has scored 32 goals in 31 matches this season, is still eligible to play in the Copa del Rey and featuring during the midweek 3-0 win over Atletico at the Bernabeu. He will also be able to play in next week's second leg. Wow! What a remarkable decision by the Spanish Refereeing Technical Committee. I wouldn’t like to be the next referee who officiates in a Real Madrid game. This is all about Madrid. The fact Miguel Angel Ayza Gamez has been given a one month suspension and told he cannot referee any more Madrid games indicates the power and influence they have. It may have been a harsh red, but we have seen those before. The chairman of the FIFA Referees Committee is Spanish too, so he will be taking an interest in this. It also comes out the day Cristiano Ronaldo has his appeal hearing, which suggest he will be treated with leniency.","Miguel Angel Ayza Gamez could be demoted from list of La Liga match officials .

Wildlife experts cut away more than 280 feet of commercial fishing line being dragged by an endangered right whale off the Georgia coast, though some of the heavy rope had to be left tangled in the whale's mouth, officials said Thursday. Entanglement in commercial fishing gear and collisions with ships off the East Coast are considered the greatest threats to the right whale's survival. Experts estimate only about 450 of the large whales remain. Each winter they migrate to the warmer waters off Georgia and Florida to give birth to their calves. It was the first time since 2011 that a right whale snared in fishing gear has been spotted offshore in the Southeast, said Clay George, a marine mammal biologist for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. Saved: Wildlife officials freed an endangered species of whale from fishing lines off the coast of Georgia . Trapped: The whale was trapped in more than 280 feet of commercial fishing line . George was part of the team that got close enough to the 30-foot whale to sever the three-quarters-inch fishing line using a grappling hook equipped with cutting blades. 'We feel like what we did gives the whale a fighting chance to shed the remainder of the rope on its own,' said George, who estimated the whale is still dragging about 20 feet of the rope woven with lead weights. 'The real take-home message here is we can't just go out and save and fix every whale that shows up entangled. In some cases it's just completely impossible to disentangle that whale.' The entangled whale spotted this week was actually a 4-year-old male, which George said isn't surprising despite a misconception that only pregnant females and their babies migrate south at wintertime. Endangered: Wildlife officials estimate that there are only about 450 right whales left on earth . A crew doing aerial surveys for the Navy offshore near Jacksonville, Fla., spotted the whale dragging fishing line behind it Sunday. Florida officials responding by boat managed to cut away some of the rope and attach a tracking buoy to the end. The whale was about 40 miles offshore of Darien, Ga., on Monday when the Georgia DNR was able to maneuver a small boat close enough to cut away most of the remainder.","Experts estimate there are only 450 of the rare right whales left in existence .

Hillary Clinton won't be America's next president, says Minnesota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann, because many U.S. voters 'aren’t ready' for a female president and don't hunger to break new ground the way they did with Barack Obama . 'I think there was a cachet about having an African-American president because of [civil rights] guilt,' the outspoken conservative told Tribune Media Services columnist Cal Thomas, in a piece that first ran February 18. 'People don’t hold guilt for a woman,' she said, and even as Americans elect women at every other level of government, 'I don't think there is a pent-up desire' to call someone 'Madam President.' Obama, Bachmann adds, had the advantage . of being 'new and different,' while Mrs. Clinton has been a fixture in . U.S. politics since the early 1990s. Rep. Michele Bachmann called off her presidential campaign on Jan. 4, 2012, perhaps coming away with the idea that her gender kept her from wowing the crowds the way her arch-enemy Barack Obama can . Last time around: Hillary Clinton ran once in 2008, losing a bitterly fought contest to the future president Barack Obama . 'Based off her own personal experience, Rep. Bachmann found that voters weren’t simply interested in electing a president based on their gender,' Bachmann spokesman Dan Kotman told MailOnline, 'but were focused on finding a candidate based on their merits.' 'Isn’t that what the feminist movement is all about?' Bachmann's months in a heated presidential primary battle during 2011 and 2012 ended quickly after . details of her debilitating migraines emerged. She was the sole . female in a nine-person GOP field. Hillary Clinton played that role on the Democratic side of the political ledger in 2008, and lasted far longer than the Bachmann would four years later. The former U.S. senator and first lady won the New Hampshire Democratic Primary before fading in the end and losing the nomination to Barack Obama. With Hillary on the far left and Michell on the far right, there's no love lost between the two. If Clinton were to succeed her husband in the White House, Bachmann said, 'effectively she . would be Obama's third and fourth term in office' since she was 'the godmother of Obamacare' in 1993. But Hillary is beatable, she added . President Obama (L) benefited from white Americans' generations-long civil-rights 'guilt,' Bachmann told columnist Cal Thomas (R), adding that no such bonus points were available for females . 'She has a real problem when it comes to Benghazi,' says Bachmann of the 2012 terror attack in Libya that unfolded during Mrs. Clinton's time as Secretary of State. 'She was in charge during the Benghazi debacle. If a person reads the Senate Intelligence report and the House Foreign Affairs report released [last] week, it is damning for Hillary Clinton,' the tea party darling told the columnist. Bachmann herself isn't running for re-election.She's facing a cloud of ethics uncertainties stemming from payments her campaign-related organizations made to an Iowa state legislator while he was stumping for her in the run-up to the 2012 Iowa Caucuses. But Kotman said that Clinton's shortcomings will end her career without reaching America's political pinnacle. 'Tthe former Secretary of State has many glaring challenges to address,' he said. Eght years later: Clinton, now 66, is a virtual lock for front-runner status when the Democrats' 2016 White House scrum begins .","There's no 'pent-up desire' for someone to call Madame President, says the Minnesota conservative firebrand .

Danish Minhas was 17 when he offered to pay Nur Mohamed, then 18, to stab his mother, who he had complained was too strict. Mohamed has already pleaded guilty to the killing, telling a court last year how Minhas had driven him to the family home in November 2009.

Two weeks after her murder, Ms Khan's son, Minhas, was arrested over the killing. Minhas, a popular student who used to read the morning announcements over the . public address system at Fort Lee High School, which he and Mohamed attended, believed his mother was too strict, investigators said. When he appeared in court Thursday, he pleaded guilty to murder in exchange for a 50-year prison term. He could have faced life in prison if he had been convicted by a jury. 'I think this was a very unusual crime. It's very very sad and hard to contemplate why anyone would want to do this,' prosecutor Angela Weltin said, according to the Houston Chronicle. Minhas fell under suspicion after telling detectives he had been on a date, then said he had been driving around Galveston.

The student had been the one to discover the body of his mother, who was stabbed more than three dozen times by Mohamed. Her killer was caught after detectives linked a bloody handprint found on a doorknob to Mohamed, who was arrested for drug charges at school a few weeks later. Mohamed told a court last year that Minhas took him to the family's apartment and signaled that his mother was home. After the killing, Mohamed claimed that Minhas drove him home.

A California woman who murdered her husband 14 years ago by poisoning him with antifreeze in order to cash in on a life insurance policy she took out on him will be executed, the California Supreme Court ruled Thursday. Angelina Rodriguez - who also is suspected of killing her 13-month-old daughter in 1993 - appealed the death sentence she was given after her conviction in the murder of her then-husband, Jose Francisco Rodriguez . Rodriguez and the victim - a special education teacher - were married several months before his 2000 death, which was brought on by Rodriguez's systematically serving him drinks laced with antifreeze and oleander. Killer: Angelina Rodriguez will be executed for murdering her husband, an appeals court ruled Thursday . Shortly after the couple was married Rodriguez convinced her husband to take out joint life insurance polices, which authorities say was her motive for killing the man. Rodriguez's attorneys appealed her death sentence, arguing that the jury in the sentencing phase of her trial never should have heard testimony that implicated her in her daughter's death nearly a decade earlier. Rodriguez has never been charged with a crime in the death of her daughter, but after murdering her husband, law enforcement officials re-examined the death of the baby and determined that the girl likely was murdered. The baby, Alicia, died after choking on a pacifier that had been recalled after consumers complained that it often broke into pieces that could get lodged in a child's throat. Two months prior to the death of Alicia, Rodriguez took out a $50,000 life insurance policy on the baby - without telling the baby's father, her then-husband - naming herself as the beneficiary. Rodriguez also sued the company that made the pacifier, landing a $710,000 settlement. Death sentence: In addition to murdering her husband, a judge says she likely killed her daughter, too . In the Court's decision, Justice Ming W. Chin wrote that even though Rodriguezz had never faced charges in the death of her daughter, the jury in the sentencing phase of the trial should have been aware that 'there was ample evidence that defendant murdered her daughter,' according to the Los Angeles Times. Chin also wrote that poisoning her husband was likely at least the second time Rodriguez attempted to murder him - Chin says she made a previous attempt by loosening natural gas valves in the couple's garage several weeks before poisoning him. In addition to murdering her husband and likely murdering her daughter, while in jail awaiting trial Rodriguez tried to dissuade a witness from testifying against her by potentially having the witness killed. For that crime, the jury convicted her of interfering with the witness but failed to reach a verdict on whether she tried to have the witness murdered. Rodriguez's attorney for her appeal, Karen Kelly, told the paper she is going to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the lower court's decision.","Angelina Rodriguez is on California's Death Row for the 2000 murder of her husband .

A new study proves what most headache had suspected - that having more stress in your life leads to more headaches. There was a 'clear link' between the amount . of stress people's lives and how often they experienced a headache. Trigger: Scientists say they have proved that stress does trigger headaches, suffered by Desperate Housewives' Star Marcia Cross. She says that reducing stress helped get her migraines under control . Those most seriously affected had a six per cent rise in ‘headache days’, says the study released ahead of the American Academy of Neurology’s 66th Annual Meeting in Philadelphia. Research by Mintel in the UK found as many as 30.4 million Britons - three out of four adults - claim to have suffered from headaches or migraines in the past six months. Susan . Haydon, who runs the information and enquiry service at the charity The . Migraine Trust, said: 'Migraines and stress are strongly linked. 'Indeed, anxiety, excitement . and any form of tension and shock may all lead to a migraine attack. 'However, some people report that their migraines start when the stress reduces. 'This . is sometimes experienced as weekend headaches, when, after a busy and . stressful week at work, an individual might experience a migraine at the . weekend when they relax after being stressed. 'Although . stress is often unavoidable, it is important to try to reduce the . effects of other migraine triggers during a stressful time, for example . by eating regularly and getting adequate sleep, which can also help in . dealing with stress.' For the study, 5,159 people age 21 to 71 in the general population were surveyed about their stress levels and headaches four times a year for two years. Participants stated how many headaches they had per month and rated their stress level on a scale of zero to 100. A total of 31 per cent of the participants had tension-type headache, 14 per cent had migraine, 11 per cent had migraine combined with tension-type headache and for 17 per cent the headache type was not classified. Those with tension-type headache rated their stress at an average of 52 out of 100. For migraine, it was 62 out of 100 and 59 for those with migraine and tension-type headache. For each type of headache, an increase in stress was associated with an increase in the number of headaches per month. For those with tension headache, an increase of 10 points on the stress scale was associated with a 6.3-percent increase in the number of headache days per month. For migraine, the number of headache days per month went up by 4.3 per cent, and 4 per cent for those with migraine and tension headache. The results were adjusted to account for factors that could affect the number of headaches, such as drinking, smoking and frequent use of headache drugs. Study author Dr Sara Schramm, of . University Hospital of University Duisburg-Essen in Germany, said it was . a vicious circle for many sufferers, with stress triggering a headache, . and then the headache making the stress worse. There is a 'clear link' between between the amount of stress people's lives and how often they experienced a headache. The most stressed people had six per cent more headache days each month, researchers found . She said: ‘These results show that this is a problem for everyone who suffers from headaches and emphasise the importance of stress management approaches for people with migraine and those who treat them. ‘The results add weight to the concept that stress can be a factor contributing to the onset of headache disorders, that it accelerates the progression to chronic headache, exacerbates headache episodes, and that the headache experience itself can serve as a stressor.‘ .

Cases of seasonal flu have fallen to a record low in Britain - and the dismal wet weather may be to blame. Only 3.1 per cent of people visited a GP with flu-like symptoms in the first week of February this year, according to Public Health England – less than a tenth of the number expected. Figures show the virus has struggled to rise beyond summer levels over the last few months. Fall: Only 3.1 per cent of people visited a GP with flu-like symptoms in the first week of February this year. This is less than a tenth of the number who would usually have sought treatment. (The large spike in 2010/11 is connected with swine flu) One theory is that the wettest winter on . record has kept people away from public spaces, while mild temperatures . have boosted immune systems, resulting in fewer opportunities for germs . to spread. Flu generally peaks before Christmas, especially in an epidemic year, but this winter the number of people suffering from the virus was comparable with a typical June, July and August. Although some years see a significant spike in cases in late February, this is rare. The number of cases generally falls as the days get longer, making it highly likely this winter will break all records. It's not only flu that is on the decline - medical treatment for respiratory illness in general is predicted hit record lows by the end of winter. The key factor in the improvement in respiratory health is thought to be a decline in smoking. Tis the season: Flu and other respiratory illnesses peak in the winter months. Graph shows the dramatically lower number being reported by GPs this year . Flu symptoms include the sudden onset of fever, a cough with a sore throat, and aching muscles and joints. It . is advised that if you are otherwise healthy and are suffering from . flu, you should stay at home, rest, drink plenty of fluids and take pain . relievers such as paracetamol. Children under 16 should not take any . medication containing aspirin. Although we still see flu epidemics in Britain, news of the record low follows 40 years of continual decline in the impact of the virus. Better hygiene, less pollution and increasing numbers of people willing to self-medicate are reasons put forward by experts, but the truth is nobody knows for certain why respiratory infections are falling. Professor Nick Phin, a flu expert at Public Health England, told the Independent: 'I suspect we are seeing a real reduction in flu, but whether it is on the scale of the GP consultation data is a moot point.' 'There has been a change in behavior among patients, with more treating themselves at home instead of going to the GP. Even if the prevalence of flu had not changed that would lead to a fall in consultations.' Got the bug: Although we still see flu epidemics in Britain, news of the record low follows 40 years of continual decline in the impact of the virus . Another reason put forward for the decline is an increase in vaccinations after the 2009 swine flu pandemic left 474 people dead. The picture is a stark contrast to last year. Last January doctors reported a massive increase in cases of the potentially deadly virus. Health experts revealed that the number of people visiting their GPs had increased by almost 50 per cent in two weeks. It came as the UK was recovering from the worst norovirus outbreak in years - with 1.1million people struck down by the winter vomiting bug. And GP consultations soared in the winter of 2010/11 due to swine flu. The condition, which peaked in July 2009, caused over 1,000 deaths.","Only 3.1% of people visited a GP with flu-like symptoms in early February .

This English soldier said British people would pay for the crimes of the government . One man, who speaks to Vice News with his face covered, declares jihad against Britain and America. He said: 'I say to the United States that your time will come and we will bleed you to death and, Insha'Allah (God willing), shall raise a flag in the White House.' He also said wants Britain to become a Muslim state. Holding a rifle, the soldier said; 'I would like to say to the people of Britain, where is your democracy? Where is your freedom of speech? Where you say that you will help the people of Syria, but you have not helped the people of Syria. You have allied of Iran, of America. We have to bring back the honour of Islam...

A second British soldier, who also hides his face, says: 'You have the power to remove . your government. Normal folk, will take the blame for the crimes that . are committed worldwide, by Britain itself, so we have to fight. 'It's part of our obligation, to protect our honour and our women.' The five minute video was taken by reporters given access to the Al-Qaeda factions of the Free Syria Army fighting against President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Last week MI5 head Andrew Parker told a parliamentary committee the threat of ‘terror tourism’ to Syria was growing. He warned: ‘We’ve seen low hundreds of people from this country go to Syria for periods and come back – some large numbers are still there – and get involved in fighting. 'It is a very important strand of the threat we face.’ Foreign fighters are flocking to the Syrian frontline, according to MI5. Muslim leaders and governments across Europe have warned of the number of young Muslim men travelling to the war-torn country to fight jihad . The civil war has exposed Sectarian tensions in the country between Sunni and Shia people . Jihadist fighters are believed to make up about 10 per cent of the troops. One French volunteer fighter said he had travelled to Syria for Jihad. In order to organise the different nationalities, commanders have English, Russian, French and Dutch interpreters. Muslim leaders and governments in Europe are calling on their citizens to return. The Islamic Community of Kosovo said today that fighting in Syria 'has nothing to do with religious principles' and it only prolongs the life of Assad's government and the suffering of Syrian people. Authorities say some 150 ethnic Albanians are believed to have joined foreign rebels. German jihadists are also heading for Syria in increasing numbers and are able to integrate quickly into foreign militant groups where Arabic is not needed, the head of Germany's domestic intelligence said today. Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the Bundesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz since 2012 (BfV), said they knew of 220 German citizens fighting in Syria, but the actual number could be much higher, and had risen sharply this year. Such is the number of foreign jihadists, like this Frenchman, that commanders have had to hire translators . There are fears European fighters could bring the skills they have learned back to their native countries to wage war there . 'For young people wanting to wage jihad, . Syria is very interesting,' he said in an interview. 'It is easy to get . to, you only need an identity card, a flight to Turkey then a domestic . flight to the border.' 'Once you are there you can be quickly integrated into brigades, and you can fight alongside people with the same language.' Syria's two-and-a-half-year-old conflict began as a wave of peaceful protests against four decades of rule by the family of President Bashar al-Assad, but it has transformed into a full scale civil war which has cost at least 100,000 lives. The civil war has also exposed sectarian tensions. Assad is from Syria's minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam, which has largely stood behind him. Syria's Sunni Muslim majority has led the uprising. Fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front and the Islamic State for Iraq and the Levant, which is heavily comprised of foreign jihadists, have also joined the conflict. Berlin fears young German Islamists could bring knowledge learned in Syria back home and plan attacks on German soil.","English volunteer soldiers have warned Britain and U.S. will be next .

Hailey Owens: Witnesses say a man grabbed Hailey from in front of a neighbor’s home and drove away in a gold 2008 Ford Ranger Tuesday afternoon . Charged: Craig Michael Wood, 45, was taken into custody on Tuesday night, about three hours after Hailey Owens was abducted from a street near her Springfield home . Wood, 45, was taken into custody on Tuesday night, about three hours after Hailey Owens was abducted from a street near her Springfield home. According to local news reports the family of the 10-year-old have confirmed that Hailey's body has been found - but police have not yet confirmed where. In an early morning news conference, Springfield Police Chief Paul Williams said that Wood is being held on suspicion of first degree murder and that the FBI is searching his home and his Ford Ranger. 'The FBI sent their evidence response team down last night and they are assisting us with processing the crime scene at East Stanford St.,' said Williams at 6am on Wednesday morning. Williams declined to answer questions at the news conference this morning and did not provide any information on the condition of Hailey's body. Witnesses told investigators that a man in a gold-colored 2008 Ford Ranger drove down the street several times before approaching Hailey and pulling her into his truck around 5 p.m. Tuesday . Police located Wood about 8:30 p.m. in his vehicle in his driveway at 1538 E. Stanford, where he lives. Approximately 35 police and FBI arrived at his home to search his property and his Ford Ranger. Police said they also found evidence of foul play in the area but offered no other details. Witnesses told police they saw a man — matching Wood’s description — abduct her near her home in the 3200 block of W. Lombard Street shortly before 5 pm on Tuesday. They said the man approached her, asked her for directions and then pulled her into a 2008 gold Ford Ranger with Missouri tags 1YF454 or 1YS454. A witness, Carlos Edwards, told a News-Leader photographer he saw the girl being abducted as he and his wife sat in the garage of their home. Investigation: Police have not officially confirmed that Hailey's body has been discovered at Craig Michael Wood's home - but their investigation is centered only on his property and his Ford Ranger . Edwards said the suspect drove up and down the street several times before pulling up alongside the girl and asking her if she knew the location of Springfield Street before grabbing her. Edwards said he tried to run after the truck as his wife got the license number and called 911. A Springfield Public Schools employee database shows that Craig M. Wood was first employed in August 1998 as a paraprofessional for in-school suspension. A salary list published by the district for this year shows he was still working in that role and as a coach and made $17,220 last year at Pleasant View Middle School. Hailey is a student at Westport Elementary School and last year she attended Bowerman Elementary School. Springfield Public Schools Superintendent Norm Ridder released the following statement: . 'Last night we learned the terrible news that one of our students had been abducted near her home. This morning, our sadness is compounded by the recent developments in the case of Hailey Owens’ abduction. Sad: The witness reports triggered a multi-state Amber Alert, Springfield police said on Wednesday. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation canceled a statewide Amber Alert for Owens and reported on their website on Wednesday that at 7 a.m. local time, Springfield police 'announced that they had a suspect in custody and that (Hailey) was deceased.' 'The suspect in this case, Craig Michael Wood, was arrested by Springfield Police Department. Wood has been employed by SPS since Aug. 18, 1998. 'He works as a paraprofessional and athletic coach at Pleasant View K-8 School. His employment has been suspended until this matter is resolved.' Initially, Hailey's abduction triggered a multi-state Amber Alert, Springfield police said on Wednesday. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation canceled a statewide Amber Alert for Owens and reported on their website Wednesday that at 7 a.m. local time, Springfield police ""announced that they had a suspect in custody and that (Hailey) was deceased."" A KBI spokeswoman confirmed that the website information was accurate. Wood is being held in the Greene County jail on suspicion of first degree murder, according to the jail's online booking records. On Tuesday, Hailey's mother said she was trying to stay strong. 'My nerves are shot,' Stacey Owens said, about two hours after her daughter, was abducted. Stacey said that she and her husband Jeff were trying to stay strong.","Craig Michael Wood, a 45-year-old sports coach is accused of abducting and murdering 10-year-old Hailey Owens in Springfield, Missouri .

They might not always come out as expected but with more than a fifth of British adults admitting to having at least one, tattoos are more popular than ever. But although the majority of tattoos heal quickly, not everyone gets off so lightly, among them Gemma Hardy, a 24-year-old hearing clinic assistant from Derby. Miss Hardy's ordeal began after she had a bouquet of flowers tattooed onto her foot - the latest in a series of inkings created by her regular tattooist. Devastating: Gemma Hardy, 24, from Derby, almost had to have her foot amputated after a tattoo got infected . At first, everything seemed fine but when she woke up the following morning, it was to find her foot had swollen to twice the normal size. 'I went home, got up the next day and my foot was two to three times the size it was the day before,' she remembers. Despite the pain and swelling, Miss Hardy decided not to visit a doctor and assumed that the reaction was caused by the location of the tattoo. But two weeks later, feeling increasingly unwell and with her foot still hugely swollen, friends insisted that she see a doctor. Once at hospital, doctors finally had the chance to examine her swollen foot - and Miss Hardy was left horrified by what they found. Painful: Gemma calls the offending tattoo 'the tomato' because of its red and angry appearance . 'They diagnosed me with blood poisoning - septicaemia,' she says. '[Doctors said] if I'd left it any longer, I would have been looking at amputation. She added: 'It was really, really swollen and . infected.They told me . that if I'd left it much longer, the infection could have gone to my . bone and then I would have looked at losing my foot.' The thought of what could have happened left her devastated. 'I was 20-years-old and someone told me I . was running the risk of losing my foot,' she reveals. 'I was absolutely beside myself. I'd got a full time job, I was horse riding, I had a motorbike and I . was about to lose all of that because of a tattoo.' Luckily, doctors were able to save her foot but the once-pretty floral tattoo was left looking hideously angry and red. Fix: Gemma has since had the offending tattoo covered with a picture of a Venus Flytrap . 'I refer to it as ""the tomato"" because it's angry and red and slightly like a tomato,' adds Miss Hardy. Despite her brush with disaster, Miss Hardy admits that she's still a fan of tattoos and, in a bid to tackle the unpleasant inking, is to have new artwork tattooed over the top. 'I don't really want to sacrifice having a finished, beautiful tattoo because this happened,' she reveals. 'I'm nervous about having my tattoo done . again on my foot just because of how bad the reaction was before but . I'll get past that to get it finished. She added: 'I'm really looking forward to it being . normal and being able to wear the kind of shoes I want to wear; just . showing it off and having it be something I'm proud of.'

Lawyers for Sharper, who played in the NFL from 1997 to 2010 primarily with the Green Bay Packers, said they would prove that any sexual contact Sharper engaged in was welcomed. 'All of these were consensual contact between Mr. Sharper and women who wanted to be in his company,' said attorney Leonard Levine. Scroll down for video . Facing jail time: Former NFL safety Darren Sharper appeared in Los Angeles court Thursday to face charges of drugging a raping two women at a night club . Their case: Sharper plead not guilty to the charges Thursday and his lawyers say they can prove the sexual encounters were consensual . But a prosecutor pointed out the fact that Sharper is also under investigation for similar crimes in Florida, Arizona, Louisiana and Nevada and asked a judge for $10million bail. The judge rejected that as excessive, though increased it from $200,000 to $1million. 'The court considers these crimes quite serious and has to protect the public,' Superior Court Judge Renee Korn said. Sharper, wearing a gray suit and black t-shirt, came to court with his lawyers and a bail bondsman who immediately arranged to post his bail. The judge ordered Sharper to remain in Los Angeles, stay away from nightclubs and not be alone with any woman he did not know before October, when the first allegations emerged. Glory days: Sharper spent most of his careers playing for the Green Bay Packers but was on the Saints team when they won the Super Bowl in the 2009 season . The judge set a court date for April 15 to schedule a preliminary hearing. Korn rejected a bid by defense attorney Blair Berk to shut down the release of information in the case. 'We're asking to litigate this in a court of law, not by Twitter feed and entertainment shows,' said Berk. The latest allegations surfaced in a Miami Beach police report released Thursday. It was filed January 19 - more than a year after the alleged attack. No charges have been filed but Detective Vivian Hernandez said the investigation remains open. Mr Sharper met his latest accuser in 2012 at Club Mokai, according to a Miami Beach Police department affidavit.

Her friends tried to take her home, but the woman was too drunk to even leave the apartment, they told cops. The . woman awoke about five hours later, with her pants off and Mr Sharper . raping her without using any protection, she told police. 'What's going on,' the startled woman says she asked him. He made her get dressed and kicked her out of his apartment while trying to keep her cell phone. She eventually retrieved it.

The former all-pro would meet women in a nightclub and invite them back to a hotel room or his apartment to party, said police. He would then offer them shots spiked with drugs and sexually assault his victims after they passed out, officials said. Multiple complaints said Sharper used morphine and zolpidem, which is sold under the brand name Ambien, to sedate his prey. The women then woke up and came to the realization they had been sexually assaulted, according to court documents. The . previously dismissed 2011 investigation in Miami Beach saw two women . complain of being drugged and waking up to Sharper trying to remove . their clothes and waggling his genitalia in their faces, according to .

A wine expert has blasted the White House for serving 'cheap' vintages that cost about $50 or less at Tuesday's state dinner for the French President. It comes as little surprise that the wines served at the gala were all from American vineyards, but wine blogger and New York University professor Tyler Colman criticized the choices for being driven by the budget at opposed to the quality of the wine. 'The Obama White House seems to have made a conscious choice to bring down the price of the wines. This is unfortunate: given the White House policy of only serving American wines, they really should showcase the best of what America is making, irrespective of price,' Mr Colman wrote on his blog, Dr Vino. Scroll down for video . Gala glasses: The State Dinner held on Tuesday at the White House was in honor of French President Francois Hollande's trip to America . Enjoying the spread: Mr Hollande, who was conspicuously without a date after he split from his longtime girlfriend amid affair rumors, sat between the Obamas at the 300-person gala . 'Sure, State Dinners are expensive, but has anyone taken a look at the Department of Defense budget and procurement lately? Fine wine at a state dinner is the equivalent of a few toilet seats and wrenches at the DoD.' The wine in question included a 2011 white Morlet 'La Proportion Doree' from Napa Valley, a Chester-Kidder red blend from Washington state and a Thibaut-Jannison dessert chardonnay from Monticello, Virginia. The Napa white retails between $45 and $60 per bottle, the red blend averages around $50 and the dessert wine comes in as the cheapest at $30. One explanation for the price-conscious selections is that the Obama administration has been criticized for going the other direction in the past. Whining over wine: The selections included a 2011 white Morlet 'La Proportion Doree' from Napa Valley (left), a Chester-Kidder red blend from Washington state (center) and a Thibaut-Jannison dessert chardonnay from Monticello, Virginia (right) Filled with symbolism: The food and wine selections were chosen for purposeful reasons, like salad and honey from the White House garden and vineyards from French-born winemakers . First course: American Osetra Caviar and Fingerling Potato VeloutÃ©, Quail Eggs, Crisped Chive Potatoes . Second course: A winter garden salad with mixed radishes, baby carrots and lettuce topped with a red wine vinaigrette . Main Course: Dry-aged rib eye beef with blue cheese from Jasper Hill Farm and charred shallots, oysters, mushrooms and chard . Dessert: Hawaiian chocolate malted ganache with vanilla ice cream and tangerines . At the state dinner held for Chinese President Hu Jintau in January 2011, the White House selected a Washington state cabernet sauvignon that sold for $115-per-bottle (though some reports say that the price shot up to $399 at the time of the dinner). After the blowback, the White House opted not to list the wine that was paired with the meal when British Prime Minister David Cameron came to America in March 2012. On top of being price conscious, the White House decision makers tried to make sure that there were symbolic connections that explained their selections, as the winemakers at both the Morlet and the Chester-Kidder vineyards grew up in France. Cheers: Wine critic and professor Tyler Colman (right) said that the White House based their selections on politics rather than prestige of the wine itself, which he argued should be important when serving the French . The Virginia wine was a nod to President Obama and President Hollande's day trip to President Thomas Jefferson's estate at Monticello on Monday. Jefferson was the American ambassador to France before taking over the White House. Mr Colman, however, felt that the French connections were 'modest at best'. 'These formal occasions seem guided more by politics or the lack of curiosity of the White House Usher,' he wrote on Twitter.","Wine professor Tyler Colman said that the White House opted for reasonably-priced wines instead of showing the best vintages .

Babies with genetically modified DNA could be born in the UK as soon as next year (stock image) You’ve heard of GM crops, but GM babies could be born in the UK as soon as next spring. Parliament is poised to vote on whether a new form of IVF treatment, which uses DNA from three parents, will become legally available to couples, making the prospect of genetically-modified humans imminent. The procedure is designed to get rid of genetic mutations that can lead to blindness, epilepsy and other medical problems. If politicians embrace the procedure, the law would be the first to allow pre-birth human DNA modification. The complex technique will replace mitochondrial DNA to avoid destructive cell mutations if the law is passed by Parliament. The issue is is expected to be debated before July this year. Mitochondria convert energy from food into essential ingredients that human cells need in order to function. Critically, they also carry their own DNA as well as the nuclear DNA in humans’ chromosomes which store most of our genetic information, Forbes reported. Only mothers pass on mitochondrial DNA to their children, which sometimes contains mutations that can lead to epilepsy, diabetes, blindness and other medical problems. It is estimated that one in 5,000 to 10,000 women carry mitochondrial DNA with mutations, Nature reported and some even lead to fatal diseases. However, these problems could help to be avoided using genetic modification techniques. If the law is passed, scientists will combine mitochondrial DNA from a donor with the nucleus from a potential mother’s egg so that the baby would not suffer from disorders caused by mutations. This procedure has yet to be tried in humans but researchers have managed to successfully perform the procedure in rhesus monkeys.

This procedure has yet to be tried in humans but researchers have managed to successfully perform the procedure in rhesus monkeys. Parliament is expected to vote on whether the procedure can be carried out before July, which means the first GM babies could potentially be born in the UK next year. The UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has already advised Parliament to approve the use of GM techniques in humans, having looked closely at safety and ethical considerations. According to New Scientist, Parliament will debate the issue before July and therefore researchers could potentially recruit the first human couples willing to take part in mitochondrial DNA trials before the end of the year, if a law is passed. The U.S. is not expected to start trials on humans until after the UK and the Food and Drug Administration is concerned about whether the donor mother could be considered as a co-parent of a child and therefore have as many rights as the mother – even if they are contributing just 0.1 per cent to the child’s DNA. Other scientists are worried that we do not understand enough to be making such substitutions in genetic information and the research is premature.","Parliament is poised to vote on whether a .

A tiny spider that lives in the Amazon has been filmed catching its prey using a method that would not look out of place in a comic book. The spider, which is likely the species Naatlo splendida, stretches its web into a cone shape and then slings the sticky structure at flying insects to trap them. The speedy slingshot manoeuvre was caught on camera at the Tambopata Research Centre in Madre de Dios, Peru. Scroll down for video . The spider, which is likely the species Naatlo splendida, stretches its web into a cone shape (pictured) and then slings the sticky structure at flying insects to trap them . The arachnid takes its place at a spot near the centre of its web, stretches it backwards and then slings its sticky structure – complete with itself – so that the web acts like a frog’s retractable tongue. The speed of the manoeuvre gives the spider the element of surprise and seems to increase its chances of catching prey, rather than sitting and waiting for dinner to fly into its web. The spider measures 3mm and belongs to the family Theridiosomatidae. Lary Reeves, who works at the Peruvian centre, came across the creature in May 2013 while wading through a swamp looking for spectacled caiman. Looking out for bullet ants, he noticed a web that was pulled back from the centre to form a cone and a spider holding it in a tensed position along the anchor line. The spider measures 3mm and is thought to be unique in its approach to snaring insects. Lary Reeves, came across the creature in May 2013 when wading through a swamp looking for spectacled caiman. A close-up of the spider is pictured . The spider filmed in the Amazon in Peru is thought to be the species Naatlo splendida. It stretches its web into a come shape and then slings the sticky structure at flying insects to trap them. The spider filmed measured 3mm and belongs to the family Theridiosomatidae. It is possible the hairs on its body are sensory and tuned into the frequency of a fly's wings, in order to sense its prey nearby. If the spider misses the target it simply resets its web. The spiders could live throughout the Neotropics from Central America towards the southern parts of South America . Naatlo splendida was discovered around 80 years ago. ‘I looked at it a little closer, called everyone else over, and presumed that the spider released the tension in the web to capture prey. ‘As soon as the words left my mouth, a mosquito flew by and the spider slingshotted towards it,’ he said. Mr Reeves said the web is similar in design to other orb webs – the two dimensional webs made by house spiders – to capture insects. ‘The big difference is that the centre of the web is anchored to the surrounding vegetation by a line that extends from the central hub to the anchor point,’ he explained. Sitting in the centre of the web, the spider stretches it towards the anchor point ‘by crawling towards it and holding the bundled up slack in its legs’. ‘It's possible that the hairs on the spiders body are sensory, and tuned the frequency of a fly's wing beats. 'When the spider senses a fly or mosquito is within reach, it releases the tension on the line, propelling itself and the web at the flying insect. To create tension in the web, before it is released, the spider sits in the centre of the web and stretches it towards the anchor point (pictured) by crawling towards it and holding the bundled up slack in its legs . ‘If the spider misses, it seems to be able to reset the web/trap fairly flawlessly and with great ease,’ Mr Reeves said. He is unsure if the technique is more effective than a conventional web, but said it is specialised to catch ‘fresh’ insects as they emerge from bodies of water. Mr Reeves does not think the spiders risk death by propelling themselves at their prey. ‘The whole motion of the web seems to be pretty fluid. We observed the spiders firing the web when no insect was present - perhaps in response to vibrations from our breath or speech. ‘Because of this, it doesn't seem like it takes much to trigger them into releasing the web’s tension. If they were risking injury or death in propelling themselves in the web, I think the trigger would be much more conserved.’ The spiders could live throughout the Neotropics from Central America towards the southern parts of South America. The spiders (pictured) measure less than 1cm in size and Mr Reeves does not think they risk death by propelling themselves at their prey . Phil Torres, a 27-year-old biologist from los Angles, California, said it is not the first time the spiders have been found, but not much is known about their behaviour. In fact, the species – thought to be Naatlo splendida was discovered around 80 years ago. Mr Torres thinks other types of spider webs are more limited in how they entangle their prey. ‘This method of flinging the web appears to make it much more likely that the prey will get tangled, as they seem to be getting slammed into sticky web regardless of the prey's original flight speed. ‘Imagine the difference between bumping into a sticky trap and having a sticky trap flung at you,’ he said. The speedy slingshot action was filmed by 32-year-old photographer Jeff Cramer, from Lima, Peru, who used a Canon 6D and 7D with a couple of different macro lenses to get the shot. He also used a Canon 100mm macro lens as well as a Canon MP-E 65mm lens. ‘It was a fairly difficult shot to get. We were in the middle of the amazon jungle, in the middle of the night and standing in about 50cm of water with mosquitos flying,’ he said. The species Naatlo splendida was discovered around 80 years ago, but little is known about the creature and its unusual webs which are thought to be unique .","Naatlo splendida, stretches its web into a cone shape and then slings the sticky structure at flying insects .

These adorable pictures show the moment a baby liliger play fights with its 'mother' - a domestic cat called Darka . Liliger Kiara - a new hybrid cross between a male lion and a ligress - was born at Novosibirsk Zoo in Russia. But when her mother stopped producing milk, staff at the zoo had to nurse her, hand-feeding her a bottle of milk every three hours around the clock. Dedicated keeper Roza Solovieva, 40, decided to take on the unique but challenging task, taking Kiara home with her where she struck up an immediate friendship with her pet cat, Darka. Scroll down for video . Close bond: Female liliger cub Kiara, a hybrid between a lion and a ligress, struck up a close bond with domestic house cat Darka after being taken home by a zoo keeper . Surrogate mother: Kiara was born at Novosibirsk Zoo but had to be taken home by keeper Roza Solovieva when her mother stopped producing milk so she could be fed around the clock . Inseparable: Liliger Kiara and domestic cat Darka became virtually inseparable during their week together . As soon as the two were introduced, Darka, who already has a kitten of her own, slipped straight into the role of parent by licking and warming the cub as if she were her own. Pictured playing and nuzzling together, the two formed an extraordinary bond and were rarely seen apart. However, it wasn't long before the mini mammal began displaying more predatory behaviour, a sign it was time to return her mother. Head keeper Roza said: 'Zita, the cub's mother was a caring parent but as soon as Kiara was born we noticed she had stopped producing milk. 'The bond between a mother and a new born cub is extremely important and we try to keep them together wherever possible but in this case we had to take drastic measures. Motherly figure: Cat Darka has a kitten of her own, so took Kiara under her wing . Growing up fast: Darka has the upper hand during a play fight with the liliger Kiara . Animal instincts: But when Kiara was big enough to start eating meat, her predator instincts started to kick in . 'As soon as I introduced Kiara to my house cat Darka, the pair just clicked. 'Darka's motherly instincts took over and she began to treat Kiara as one of her offspring, licking her and always making sure she was warm, it was beautiful to see. 'Having Kiara at home would be every cat lovers dream I would imagine but its a very serious task and requires complete dedication, but I have to say it was very fun at times. 'After one week we started introducing meat to the cub and then suddenly she started looking like more of a predator than a pet, we knew it was time to give Kiara back to her mother. 'We were worried about reintroducing the cub to her mother because of the time apart but thankfully the two are doing just fine. 'Of course both me and Darka miss Kiara, but it makes me much happier to see her with her mother where she belongs.' Adorable: But while Kiara may look cuddly, she's still a dangerous predator .

Apple changed the way they paid their CEO Tim Cook this year, and he lost $4 million by his own choice. The board at Apple decided to pay the CEO based on the company's performance. They decided that if the company's stocks in the S&P stock index did better than other stocks, than Cook could take home more money. If the stock performed less, than Cook would take on the financial burden and take home less yearly income. Apple CEO Tim Cook chose to give up $4 million to set a strong 'leadership example' for the company . CNN reports that Apple's Proxy Report filed on Sunday implicated Cook would be taking a significant pay cut. Initially Apple didn't want Cook to give up half his stock grants. Instead they only wanted to take a sum less than half. Cook decided to risk more in order to help the company. In the proxy filing Apple said Cook had a, 'strong desire to set a leadership example in the area of CEO compensation and governance.' The 50 per cent Cook forked over added up to $4 million dollars. While the amount may sound high, Cook is not filing for  bankruptcy any time soon. CNN reports that the $4 million less he made this year represents only 10 per cent of what the CEO made last year. A year ago he got $36.4 million in stock grants, $1.4 million in salary, and a $2.8 million cash bonus. The reason Cook lost money this year is because Apple stock performed terribly in August. It fell 26 per cent between 2012 and 2013--therefore Cook lost all the 50 per cent of stock share he put at steak. Those holding Apple shares shouldn't be too alarmed, however. Lately, Apple Stock has been surpassing the S&P 500 since August and will most likely keep all 40,000 shares worth  $22.4 million in August of 2014. Cook took over Apple in 2011 following CEO and founder Steve Job's untimely death and has done his best to fill Jobs' shoes. Apple stock fell by 26 per cent bewtween August 2012 and August 2013 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:10 EST, 26 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:09 EST, 27 January 2014 . Leah Vincent was born into the Yeshivish community, a fundamentalist sect of ultra-Orthodox Judaism. The fifth of 11 children born to a prominent Orthodox rabbi in Pittsburgh. Leah and her ten siblings were raised to worship two things: God and the men who ruled their world. At the age of 15, Leah was preparing for marriage. But the tradition-bound future Leah envisioned for herself was cut short when, at 16, she was caught exchanging letters with a male friend questioning her ultraorthodox Jewish faith. Scroll down for video . Estranged: Leah Vincent was born into the Yeshivish community, a fundamentalist sect of ultra-Orthodox Judaism but she was shunned by her parents at the age of 17 . She had violated the religious law that forbids contact between members of the opposite sex. ‘I was now marked as a girl who had spoken with boys. I was no longer a good girl,’ she says. ‘I wanted to be good. I was just too curious. My evil desires had momentarily led me astray,' she told the New York Post. ‘Your behavior has become unacceptable,’ said her mother. ‘We give you chance after chance, and you keep on messing up and hurting people. Disappointing people.' ‘You are not getting any more allowance. You’ll have to figure out how to get by on your own,’ she continued. ‘You think you’re so grown-up? Let’s see how grown-up you are.’ The final straw was when she purchased a sweater that her parents deemed immodest; she expressed an ambition to one day attend college and doubted the strict codes of conduct prescribed by her religion. Leah’s parents were unforgiving. Afraid, in part, that her behavior would affect the marriage prospects of their other children, they put her on a plane to New York City before her 18th birthday and cut off ties. Video filmed by Haimy Assefa for Footsteps.org . Shunned: At the age of 17, Leah Vincent was sent to live in New York, alone. It was there she learned about life in the real world but not before making a number of mistakes . After the sweater incident, Vincent’s parents found her a studio apartment in Kensington, Brooklyn for $450 a month and job as a secretary that paid minimum wage. They paid the first month’s rent — but after that she was completely on her own in every sense of the word. In her Yeshivish community, there was a strict segregation of the sexes. ‘Women in my family were not allowed to attend college or become Jewish scholars. Men had the ultimate authority in the home and in the community,’ Vincent writes in her memoir, Cut Me Loose. A girl’s two most important goals, she says, are to be modest and obedient. In order to reach these goals, according to Vincent, a girl must: . Wear shirts buttoned to her neck with sleeves covering her elbows and with skirts that fall below the knee. Even wearing patterned tights or wide belts are banned as too provocative. Abstain from talking to unmarried men. Be seen and not heard. The community frowned on women singing or talking too loudly. Orthodox Judaism: Women must abstain from talking to unmarried men.¿Essentially, be seen and not heard. The community would frown on women singing or talking too loudly. Leah's parents believed that anything to the contrary would jeopardize her chances of finding a husband . These rules (and many more) were vital to maintaining a good reputation, an absolute necessity for landing a suitable husband. ‘A girl’s sexuality was so powerful,’ says Vincent, ‘any hint of it had to always be completely hidden.’ At 17, she was banished by her parents and left to fend for herself in New York City. It was then her heartbreaking and terrifying experience began. For several years she lived alone in a shabby studio apartment in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn. She was lonely. Her mother rarely phoned. Her father had severed communication entirely. Accustomed to seeking male approval, she now attracted plenty of the wrong kind. She approached men hung out on the local basketball court and began a series of grim and risky relationships, culminating in her rape age 17 by a boyfriend. ‘I soon began to stop and watch the games,’ she says. ‘I longed for my stares to beckon one of those people to the bench where I sat, to talk to me.’ Several of the men began to flirt with her and one, called Nicholas, took a special interest in her. When Nicholas asked her to accompany him back to his apartment, she said yes, knowing that as a good Orthodox girl, she could not date or marry him. Awakening: Leah was unprepared to navigate the freedoms of secular life. She worked as a prostitute, cut herself, and had an affair with a married professor . Ultimately in the basement at a Manhattan club, Nicholas raped her. Not even knowing what intercourse entailed, and asked herself, ‘Was that sex?’ She lacked the basic understanding of the body and the tools to deal with men to whom she had spent a childhood learning to yield and please. By 19, Ms. Vincent had overdosed, swallowing a half-bottle of aspirin after mutilating herself with a rusty razor and ended up spending 10 days in a psychiatric hospital.. And by 21 she had tried to establish herself as a Craigslist prostitute. The responses flooded in. She picked one, a lawyer from the Upper East Side. And even though she had been in the city now for several years, even after living a very ‘modern’ life, she still was clueless. She never quoted a fee and . agreed to meet him at his place. He paid her after their second go-round — and only $60. Shamed, she vowed not to prostitute herself again. Cast out in New York City, without a father or husband tethering her to the Orthodox community, Leah was unprepared to navigate the freedoms of secular life. Cut Me Loose: Sin and Salvation After My Ultra-Orthodox Girlhood. The book details Leah Vincents life as she left her Orthodox sect and ventured out into a brave new world . 'There is little room for a single girl in Yeshivish life,' she explains, referring to the many daily restrictions imposed by ultraorthodox practice. 'For a woman, the rhythm of observance is tied to family. One is either a daughter or a wife.' At one point she returned back to the family home for a family dinner. Her parents made her eat off paper plates—not to meet the requirements of Jewish law, her sister explained, but to prevent her from 'contaminating' the family. After Ms. Vincent attempted suicide, she writes, her parents told her other siblings that she just wanted attention and that they should ignore her. She spent the next few years using her sexuality as a way of attracting the male approval she had been conditioned to seek out as a child, while becoming increasingly unfaithful to the religious dogma of her past. It took Ms. Vincent a long time, years even, to shake the feeling that she was corrupted and didn’t deserve happiness. Long after she had dropped the external markers of religiosity—her modest clothes and dietary restrictions—she still judged her actions based off of the standards with which she was raised. 'Even though I put on pants and was having sex with people, it doesn’t meant that my brain bounced back into normal, un-fundamentalist religion shape,' she said. She succeeded however, when it came to education. She had been accepted to Brooklyn College on a scholarship and achieved straight-A’s. She became involved with a married professor, 42 years her senior who encouraged her to speak up when it came to her opinions on politics, culture and the world. Leah has tried to confront the oppressive world of religious fundamentalism and the broader issues that face even the most secular young women as they grapple with sexuality and identity. Ms. Vincent also used her freedom to attend college, and with the encouragement of the prof, was awarded a scholarship at Harvard earning a master's degree at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Happy endings: Leah eventually found true love, graduated from Harvard after winning a scholarship there and is now married with a daughter . Ms. Vincent never fully explains her parents' vicious behavior. 'I felt like I was caught in a garish nightmare,' she says, recalling the period that led to her estrangement. Now at the age of 31, Leah is married to  Zeke, who also left a Hasidic upbringing in Borough Park, Queens. The two have since married and have a daughter. ‘I fiercely believe that all people should have a right to a self-determined life,’ she says. 'My parents getting stricter and stricter, my petty transgressions ballooning into terrifying sins.' It appears as though in the name of religion, they had forgotten basic humanity.","At the age of 17, Leah Vincent was sent to live in New York, alone.

Diamonds has only found four blue diamonds since they took over the . Cullinan mine in 2008. How much a diamond is worth is often decided by three factors; the flawlessness, the colour, and the rarity. While . this latest blue diamond still needs further assessment, it has already . been deemed as 'on the large end' and 'exceptional.' A spokesperson for Petra Diamonds said: 'It's a very special diamond. 'You don't usually get diamond blues . of this size or clarity. There's going to be a lot of interest in it in . the diamond buying community.'

'It may well even break new records.' When . the diamond is bought it will likely be cut and polished, meaning it could . lose between one third and half of is mass, depending on the quality of . the stone. Located at the foothills of the Magaliesberg mountain range, the Cullinan mine is 37 miles north-east of Pretoria in South Africa. The mine has a history of producing blue diamonds, but its . regular yield is mostly small white diamonds, earning its owner a . revenue of around £133 million a year from 800,000 carats in total. The diamond has yet to be cut, a process which will make it significantly smaller, as it involves shaping it, and cutting off a lot of its mass . The Cullinan diamond mine first made waves in 1905 when it unearthed the largest rough gem diamond ever found, a massive 3,106 carats. This diamond was named 'The Great Star of Africa', and became famous in British culture when it was mounted in the Scepter of the Cross, part of the Queen's crown jewels. Other notable diamonds produced by the mine include the Premier Rose, which was 353 carats rough and valued at around $10 million (£6 million), and the Golden Jubilee, 545 carats, worth up to $14 million (£8.5 million) - the largest cut and faceted diamond in the world. Cullinan has made a few very important diamond discoveries since 2008 when Petra Diamonds took over the mine, including a 39.9 carat diamond which sold for $8.8 million (£4.8 million), a 26.6 carat diamond which sold for $1.45 million (£881,030) and a 25.5 carat diamond which sold for $16.8 million (£10.2 million) last year.","Stone still needs forensic tests, but discoverers think it is 'very special'

Torn in half, this is the  precarious remnant of a medieval bell tower that stood for 700 years in testimony to Italy’s historic and cultural heritage. The 13th century Torre dei Modenesi was ripped apart by an earthquake which struck in the early hours yesterday, killing at least six and injuring 50. It later collapsed completely after a strong aftershock. In the town of Finale Emilia, as well as the bell tower, the 11th  century Castello delle Rocche  was damaged and the 14th century Palazzo dei Veneziani partially collapsed. Scroll down for video .

Which under pressure lower league football manager is risking a rap from the FA after openly admitting to club staff that he placed a half-time and full-time bet on an FA Cup game? It is against regulations to bet regardless if your club are long out of the competition. Blackpool will look to gain a loan fee for Tom Ince as talks continue. The Championship club were expecting to miss out financially with Ince closing on a summer agreement with Monaco that would give them as little as £155,000 compensation on a player valued at £8million. A loan fee of around £250,000 or more could add some financial consolation to an eventful tale.

The best and worst of British fashion will go on display tomorrow in a fascinating exhibition of Kays Catalogues dating back to 1920. Archivists have gathered over 1,500 images from the firm's brochures over the last 90 years which chart the nation's changing looks. Everything from 1940s nylon dresses to cheesy 1970s bell-bottoms are captured on the pages of the iconic mail order brochures. The images provide a snapshot of British tastes through the years, from prim skirts in the post-War years to brassy leopard-print halterneck dresses in the late 1990s. Belles of the Ball: The 1960 Autumn/Winter Kay's catalogue shows off 'Fashionable dresses' that promise 'grace and charm for eveningwear', showcasing the nipped-in waist that was favoured at the time . Kays originated in Worcester in 1890 selling functional workware and household items but moved into mainstream fashion in the 1920s. The University of Worcester has amassed the vast archive of pictures for its 'World of Kays' project - which will go on display at the city's library tomorrow. Project manager Jenni Waugh said: 'This collection is a snapshot of Britain's fashions and tastes, both good and bad, over the last century. 'Kays was always at the heart of consumer culture in this country. 'It created an image of life for working people to aspire to, allowing them to dream of what they wanted to be next. 'Some of the outfits are so outlandish and bizarre that I can't imagine anyone wearing them now but people did and with some pride.' Alison Winston, from the unversity's research collections team said: 'Kays and Co was a very influential company throughout the 20th century, in terms of the number of local people it employed and the way it represented a shift in lifestyle during this period. 'Our archive is a great resource for showing us how life and consumer behaviour changed between 1890 and 2000. 'We would encourage anyone with an interest in changing British lifestyles to see some of these treasures.' Kays began in 1890 in Worcester marketing fashions and household items. Michelle Collins was the star of the 2000 Autumn/Winter catalogue in leopard print, cowboy-style tassels, and even a dog collar choker . Actress Lisa Faulkner donned neon pink adorned with rhinestones for the 2000 Spring/Summer catalogue. The skirt-over-trousers look was also popular at the time . Noel Edmonds helped design a range of very funky shirts for Kays, which were modelled with flared 'fashion pants' in the 1980 Spring/Summer catalogue . The mail-order company quickly grew and by the 20th century millions of people across Britain used the catalogue - which allowed people to pay off goods at a small rate every week - to kit out their homes and families. In the early 1920s the catalogue advertised functional clothes including hard-wearing men's dungarees which were suitable 'for mechanics'. The ad boasts: 'Made from specially milled solid twill blue dye dungaree. They will stand washing many times.' Meanwhile, women's fashions changed dramatically - from the demure high-necked floral dresses which fell below the knee in the 1940s to racy bikinis popular in the 1960s. Arguably the most embarrassing decade for fashion was the 1980s collection of Noel Edmonds' T-shirts. Fresh-faced male models are featured sporting skin-tight £4.99 T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan 'Lazer' above a grinning picture of the bearded TV presenter. In another double-page spread entitled 'Birds of 1970s Britain', pouting models in double-breasted jackets and fur-trimmed coats strike poses on an outdoor bandstand. More modern, yet no less questionable fashions, include ex-EastEnders star Michelle Collins wearing an array of . leopard-print dresses topped off with black poncho and blood-red . lipstick for the 2000 catalogue. Actress Pat Phoenix wearing rather demure tailored suits in the 1972 Autumn/Winter catalogue. In an age before the internet, Kays catalogue was a staple for home shoppers . The double-page spread entitled 'Birds of Britain', which features pouting models in double-breasted jackets and fur-trimmed coats striking poses on an outdoor bandstand for the Autumn/Winter 1970s edition . Menswear by Beverley, modeled by terribly wholesome looking men in the  1970 Spring/Summer catalogue. Kays expanded throughout the 20th century with offices and warehouses throughout Britain including Leeds, Glasgow, Bradford, Bristol and York . Singer and actress Anita Harris in some very groovy clothes, including some iconic 1970s looks like the headband, flared trousers and A-line mini dresses . A fascinating 1,500 images from the catalogue's vast archive have been collated after the university secured a £55,000 grant for the project. Project manager Ms Waugh said: ""The clothes that Kay's sold were very much the mainstream take on underground fashion and culture. 'After all, it was for working people, not glamour godesses. 'It was all-encompassing - you could even buy live chickens at one point.' In an age before the internet Kays catalogue became a staple for home shoppers ever since its first publication in 1890. The company traces its origins back to Worcester-based Skarratt's jewellers and watchmakers in 1794. The 1960 Spring/Summer catalogue sees the over-the-knee, full-skirted dress so synonymous with the 60s housewife, advertised in a range of bold colours and patterns . In the early 1920s the catalogue advertised functional clothes including hard-wearing men's dungarees which were suitable 'for mechanics' which 'will stand washing many times' Owner John Skarratt's grandson took over the business and employed William Kay in the early 1870s. Kay eventually left the business and set up his own company in 1890 called 'Kays of Worcester'. Aided by two clerks and an errand boy, his firm was a strict 'cash with order' business, selling products to customers who subscribed to Kays catalogue. Kays expanded throughout the 20th century with offices and warehouses throughout Britain including Leeds, Glasgow, Bradford, Bristol and York.It became Worcester's biggest employer until it relocated to Liverpool in 2007. Retail giant Littlewoods merged with Kays in 2004 and it was renamed K&Co. The project was funded by a £55,500 grant from JISC, an organisation which inspires UK colleges and universities in the innovative use of digital technologies. A companion website was launched in 2011 containing hundreds of images from the past.","Exhibition of 1,500 images from Kays catalogues from the 1920s to go on display tomorrow .

"By . David Wilkes . UPDATED: . 02:35 EST, 13 October 2011 . Cricket legend: Geoffrey Boycott outside the High Court in London where he was suing a firm of solicitors over a property deal but lost . It wasn’t pretty, but he dug in and defended his end doggedly. Just like his performances at the crease in the old days. Geoffrey Boycott strode into the High . Court yesterday to tell the legal world how to play with a straight bat . as he launched a £1million-plus claim over a house he bought with a . former lover who is now dead. ‘Us ordinary people are meant to get a . fair deal from the law,’ said the England cricketer turned commentator. ‘How are ordinary people expected to understand when it’s double-Dutch? We have come to think English law is for decent, honourable people all . over the world; why does it not mean what it says?’ At the centre of the wrangle are a relationship and a £2.5million house that few would probably consider ordinary. The property is in the millionaires’ playground of Sandbanks, Dorset, overlooking Poole Harbour and with its own private beach. Boycott, 70, bought it with Anne Wyatt . for £450,000 in 1996. For years Mrs Wyatt was Boycott’s business . partner and lover. They met when they worked at the Ministry of Pensions . in Barnsley in 1958 – she was 32 and he just 18 – and lived together . for nearly 20 years in the village of Woolley, near Wakefield, before . they bought the house in Sandbanks. Divorcee Mrs Wyatt moved in alone . there. He remained in Yorkshire, eventually marrying his other long-term . lover, Rachael Swinglehurst, in 2003 after she nursed him through a . battle with throat cancer. The couple moved to Jersey three years later, . buying an eight-bedroom house for £1.2million. Mrs Wyatt died from lung cancer at the . age of 82 in 2009, and half of the Sandbanks house went into her estate . rather than being automatically inherited by Boycott as he had . expected, the court heard. Lovers: Former cricketer Geoff Boycott with his then lover Anne Wyatt. They met when he was 18 and she was 32 . Partners: Ann Wyatt with Geoff Boycott at a Foyles Literary Luncheon in 1982 . She bequeathed her share of the house . to her niece, Patricia McDermott, it is understood. The property was put . on the market for £3million last year but the asking price has since . been reduced by £500,000. Boycott is suing lawyers for . compensation claiming that, had they done their job properly 15 years . ago, Mrs Wyatt would have been able to stay in the house only for her . lifetime and, on her death, it would have been his outright. When the house was bought, it was put . in both their names as ‘joint tenants’. Boycott said it was ‘a huge . surprise’ to discover that, in 2007, she had converted that to a . ‘tenancy in common’ so that she could leave half the property to her . heirs. Asked by defence counsel Hugh Evans if . he would have gone through with the purchase if he had known she could . ‘sever’ her interest in the house, Boycott replied: ‘If I had known . either one of us could do that, I wouldn’t have gone ahead.’ Mrs Wyatt was his ‘friend and . confidante’, he said, and he let her live in the house rent-free for . years, although they were no longer partners. Dispute: Geoff Boycott's £3m home on Sandbanks, overlooking Poole Harbour in Dorset. His former partner Anne Wyatt left her half of the property to her family after she died . Bird's eye view: Boycott's property is marked with an arrow on this shot of Sandbanks in Poole Harbour . He was shocked when he learned that . she was within her rights to sever her interest in the property, and . told the court: ‘I didn’t understand why she was doing it. I was running . half way round the world doing my commentating and I just couldn’t . understand it.’ It is not the first time Geoff Boycott has stirred up a courtroom with his straight-talking Yorkshireman approach. He was convicted of beating up his . then lover Margaret Moore in an Antibes hotel room in 1996 - which he . has always strenuously denied, saying she made the story up after . slipping and banging her head. During the appeal trial in Grasse, . southern France, in October 1998, he felt moved to tell one of the . opposing lawyers to 'shoot oop' and had to be restrained by his own . aghast brief. In the adjournment that quickly followed, he explained why he snapped: 'They all talk bloody French.' He lost the appeal. After expressing his confusion at the . legal issues, Boycott told Mr Justice Vos: ‘I don’t mean to be . disrespectful; I’m just very straight. I don’t want to offend people, . but I am very direct.’ The judge apologised for the . ‘obscurity’ of the law in the field which dates back 300 years, telling . Boycott: ‘It’s history. Life’s difficult sometimes and that’s why, . unfortunately, you have had to come to court.’ Boycott replied that he now considers the whole idea of joint tenancies ‘ridiculous’. His barrister, Christopher Lundie, . said he helped buy the house by permitting funds to be drawn from a . company which he controlled and through which he provided his cricket . commentary and other public speaking services. ‘It is his case that he was prepared . to assist because he had agreed with Mrs Wyatt that the survivor of them . would have the property. At that time Mrs Wyatt was 70 and Mr Boycott . was only 56.’ The lawyers deny any liability and argue that Boycott has left it too late to sue them. The hearing of that issue is due to last two days, with the judge expected to reserve his decision.","Ex-England cricketer claims he was let down over property deal .

But the urbane dandy also applied his keen mind to more practical financial matters – as The Mail on Sunday can reveal that he secretly entered into a civil partnership with his long-term partner to avoid paying inheritance tax. The politician arranged the ceremony with Adrian Stanford to keep the taxman from taking 40 per cent of his £3.3 million estate. Erudite: Lord St John of Fawsley (left), who died last march at 82, entered into a civil partnership with his partner of more than 50 years Adrian Stanford, 77, (right) to avoid a 40 per cent tax on his £3.3m estate . Although they kept their relationship discreet, they were partners for more than 50 years. But they decided to tie the knot only when they realised they would get a tax break. Last night, Mr Stanford, 77, a former banker, said: ‘When we saw the tax advantages of a civil ceremony the decision was elementary. ‘I know some people do these things because they want their partnership to be recognised by law, but ours was to avoid the 40 per cent fee. There was no pomp and circumstance, it was very modest. ‘Normally one would have to go to a proper licensed building, but we had it at our flat because I am not very mobile since suffering a stroke.’ Lord St John with Margaret Thatcher, who he nicknamed 'the Leaderene' Speaking at the £2 million Westminster penthouse they shared until the peer’s death last March at 82, Mr Stanford added: ‘There are those who are afraid to reveal they are in same-sex partnerships because they are concerned other people will look upon them negatively, but our reason was because we felt a private life should remain private. ‘People who knew us were already aware we were partners – it becomes pretty obvious once you have lived with someone for 50 years.’ The couple met 57 years ago when Lord St John – then Norman St John-Stevas – taught Mr Stanford law at Oxford. Lord St John would later follow a political career, becoming Arts Minister and Leader of the Commons under Margaret Thatcher – but was one of the first Tory ‘wets’ to be sacked in 1981. He is said to have coined the Prime Minister’s nickname Tina – from the initials of her mantra ‘There is no alternative’ – and also called her ‘the Leaderene’ and ‘the Blessed Margaret’. He was known for affecting the manner of a fey Edwardian aesthete, such as lapsing into Latin and mispronouncing modern words. The civil ceremony took place on November 19, 2009, the same month Lord St John drew up a will with Mr Stanford as the main beneficiary. Had they not become partners in the eyes of the law, his estate would have been taxed at 40 per cent on everything above the £325,000 threshold – leaving a potential bill of up to £1.2 million.","Lord St John of Fawsley arranged ceremony with partner Adrian Stanford .

A German Catholic bishop faced pressure to resign on Wednesday after it emerged that his new palatial residence would cost £25m, over six times the original estimate. Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst, bishop of Limburg, was investigated by a Vatican envoy last month after protests in his diocese against lavish spending. His luxurious choice of home is at odds with Pope Francis's shift of the Church's focus towards simplicity and poverty. Under pressure: Franz-Peter Tebart, Bishop of Limburg, above in the courtyard of the controversial residence, is facing calls to resign after it emerged the building will cost more than six times its original value . The soaring cost of the stately residence next to Limburg's hilltop cathedral was made public by the diocese on Monday and was immediately criticised by churchgoers and officials. Local Catholic Raimund Champert said: 'Such prestige projects simply does not fit with Catholicism . 'The Church, like the Pope, has a responsibility to be humble and lead by example. 'We are not in the Middle Ages anymore.' Christoph Hefter, a lay member of the diocesan council, said: 'The cost is shocking, it is beyond belief.' Pope Francis, whose simple style contrasts with the more baroque tastes of his predecessor Benedict, whom he replaced in March, said last week he wanted the Church to serve the poor and strip itself of 'vanity, arrogance and pride.' Lavish: An aeriel picture shows the new building of the bishop's house which is said to have cost £25m . Prime location: The decadent residence is facing the Limburg Cathedral, right. Tebartz-van Elst's finances will now be audited by a commission appointed by Germany's bishops conference. Archbishop Robert Zollitsch has indicated a final report could be ready in about two months. Asked whether Tebartz-van Elst should step down, Rev. Reinhold Kalteier, head of the Limburg priests' council, said 'it is up to the bishops' conference and Rome now'. Diocese spokesman Martin Wind said the 53-year-old bishop had appealed for trust and patience. He said: 'We will have to wait to see how the audit turns out to see where responsibilities lie, and who is to blame or not to blame' Last month's visit by Vatican monitor Cardinal Giovanni Lajolo marked a new willingness in Rome to focus on the leadership styles of bishops. One of the key messages of the current Pope's leadership is that he wants to be less aloof and closer to their congregations. After Lajolo spent a week interviewing Tebartz-van Elst, his staff and his clerical and lay critics, the bishop said: 'I am very sorry for any carelessness or misjudgement on my part.' Contrary:  Tebartz-van Elst's spending on the property is said to be at odds with the message of Pope Francis, above, who said that his bishops should strip themselves of 'vanity, arrogance and pride' During the more conservative reign of . Pope Benedict, Tebartz-van Elst was tipped as a candidate to replace . the soon-to-retire Cardinal Joachim Meisner, a close ally of the . German-born pontiff, as head of the country's largest and richest . diocese, Cologne. That speculation cooled after Pope Francis was elected in March and ended as the extent of his spending emerged. Tebartz-van Els already has legal problems after prosecutors on Thursday accused him of lying to a court. Chief Hamburg prosecutor Nana Frombach said in a statement that she had asked the court to fine Limburg Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst an unspecified amount for providing false testimony in a case he brought against Der Spiegel magazine. The Bishop had brought action against the magazine after they ran a piece in which he was quoted as saying that he would only fly business class on aeroplanes. Tebartz-van Elst's office had no comment.","Limburg bishop spending £25m euros on new residence .

'World's most arrested man': Henry Earl has been arrested more than 1,500 times since 1970. Above, his most recent mugshot from a public intoxication arrest in early October . Henry Earl spent Thanksgiving at home - which is to say, in jail. The 65-year-old Kentucky man deemed the 'World's Most Arrested Man' by The Smoking Gun with a rap sheet of over 1,500 arrests, found himself back in jail after a public intoxication arrest last month. In fact it's the third time in the past five years that Earl has been in lock up for the holiday. In fact most of Earl's arrests have relate to public intoxication, so perhaps it was good he celebrated the holiday in a sober environment. 'He is somewhat of a superstar in his own little world,' Fayette County Detention Center Officer John Casey told ABCNews.com. Earl's arrest history goes as far back as July 1970 when he was in his twenties for carrying a concealed weapon.He would go on to be arrested 33 more times that decade. Since then, Earl has been gradually increasing his frequency of arrests. In the 1980s, Earl picked up the pace with 230 arrests, most due to public drunkenness or disorderly conduct. But it wasn't until 2008, that Earl gained national attention when he found himself in court for his 1000th arrest for public intoxication. Judge Gary Payne made it an occasion by sentencing Earl to 1000 days in jail 'for your anniversary'. While Judge Payne was under the impression that it was Earl's 1,000th arrest, The Smoking Gun later discovered that it was actually number 1,333. The man with many mugshots: Earl never takes the same mugshot twice, as evidenced in the above collage from just a few of his arrests in Kentucky .","Henry Earl, 65, has been arrested over 1,500 times .

Ancient 'halls of the dead' pre-dating Stonehenge are being heralded by archaeologists as the first monuments of their kind to be found in the UK. The two earth long barrows were uncovered on top of Dorstone Hill in Herefordshire and are thought to date to about 3,800BC, almost 1,000 years before the famous stone circle in Wiltshire was built, according to Professor Julian Thomas, of the University of Manchester. Archaeologists who have spent a month excavating the mounds say they have removed fine examples of flint weapons and tools, thought to have been buried in the barrows when first created or later left as offerings to the dead. A flaked flint knife (pictured) was found in a cremation pit dug into the side of one of the two long barrows as the remains of two large 6000-year-old halls, each buried within a prehistoric burial mound, have been discovered in Herefordshire . Professor Thomas said the site was the only one of its type in the UK where 'the halls of the living became the halls of the dead', with the long communal halls first 'ritually' burned and then covered over with soil and turf to form the large barrows. He said: 'With this phenomenon of deliberately burning down buildings, tending the fire over a period of days, the argument is that you burn these down when the head of the family dies. 'Here, no new house has been built, but instead they have shovelled up the remains into these barrows and enclosed them with turf. He added: 'It's a very important site.' Among the finds are two stone axe-heads, a flint hand knife and an arrowhead, with some of the raw materials used in their construction pointing to origins hundreds of miles away from where they were found, according to the dig team. An artist's impression of the Neolithic long hall. Two earth long barrows were uncovered that archeologists believe date to about 3,800BC, almost 1,000 years before Stonehenge was built . The barrows themselves date to the early Neolithic period when the ancient Britons were starting to settle into small communities. In one possible clue to the violence of the period, a broken flint arrowhead was discovered in a stone burial chamber uncovered off the side of one of the barrows - although the human remains of the arrow's possible victim which would have lain within the cairn have long since disappeared due to the acidity of the soil, Professor Thomas said. Archaeologists have also been excited by the level of preservation in the timber construction of the original hall buildings, with the intense heat of the fire carbonising the wood's form even, including the joints and post holes. The barrows measure 30 metres and 70 metres in length, with a single main burial chamber at each end. Although made originally of earth, at a later date they were covered in stone like cairns found in the Black Mountains of Wales, Professor Thomas said. Investigation trenches dug at the site on top of Dorstone Hill in Herefordshire. Professor Thomas said the site was the only one of its type in the UK where 'the halls of the living became the halls of the dead,' with the long communal halls first 'ritually' burned and then covered over with soil and turf to form the large barrows . The smaller of the barrows has the remains of holes, thought to have contained two metre-wide upright oak posts between which was supported a trough lined with planks upon which the human remains would be placed. The dig has been carried out by a team from the Manchester university, the University of Kyushu and Herefordshire Council, who will return to the site to continue work next year. Dr Keith Ray, Herefordshire county archaeologist and dig co-director, said: 'In the British context, the Dorstone find is unique and unprecedented.' Professor Thomas said they had uncovered a picture of a 'monument that keeps changing' with the needs of the people living around it at the time. He added: 'This is a special place with significance as new bodies and new offerings are deposited here. 'Hundreds of years after the first burial, there are very fine flint objects being left here. Professor Julian Thomas professor of archaeology at the University of Manchester (pictured) described the site as 'a very important find'. Archaeologists have also been excited by the level of preservation in the timber construction of the original hall buildings . 'It's a very important site, firstly because for the first time we have the fabric of an early Neolithic hall being incorporated into the building of a funerary monument. 'Also, because of the preservation of the remains of the structure including evidence of carpentry, we are going to be able to say rather more about the character of these early Neolithic buildings.' Dr Ray said the fact more burial chambers and artefacts had been left at the site hundreds of years after it was first created showed its national importance. 'These subsequent finds show that 1,000 years after the hall burial mounds were made, the site is still important to later generations living 200 miles away - a vast distance in Neolithic terms,' he said. 'For example, the axe and knife may not have been traded, but placed there as part of a ceremony or an ancestral pilgrimage from what is now East Yorkshire. 'So we witness an inter-connected community linking Herefordshire and East Yorkshire by marriage and by descent 5,000 years ago.'","Manchester archaeologists have found communal halls that were first 'ritually' burned and then covered over with soil to form large barrows .

As the Brazilian contestants sashayed onto the stage in pink bikinis for a beauty pageant held in Rio de Janeiro’s João Caetano Theatre, their incredible figures drew a loud applause and cheers from a hyped up, excited audience. The wolf-whistles and shouts of appreciation were not just for the models’ feminine curves; they are also for the breathtaking courage of the leggy, high cheeked sirens, who in flaunting their bodies made an unequivocal statement that they are proud to be transvestites and transsexuals. All were born as men. But that wasn't the most controversial aspect of Monday night's Miss Trans Brazil 2013 contest. Scroll down for video . Glamour: Contestants line up for the Miss Trans Brazil 2013 contest in Rio de Janeiro on Monday night . For the first time, the organisers, the Transgender Association for the State of Rio de Janeiro (RIO ASTRA), offered the winner a transsexual operation from male to female in Thailand. The prize ran into controversy because a sex change operation is against the law in Brazil. Instead of withdrawing the prize as they were instructed to do, the organisers dodged the problem. 'We did not directly offer transgender surgery as a prize. We presented the award as a gift voucher with the option for the winner to do what they want with the money in Thailand. Leggy: For the first time, the organisers of the event are offering the winner a transsexual operation from male to female in Thailand . 'It will be entirely up to them,' says the President of ASTRA, Marjorie Marchi, carefully choosing her words speaking to the Mail Online. It means, the victor can either undergo a sex change or have the best cosmetic facial and plastic surgery in the Far East country. The prize was worth £4,000 with a year of counseling if they choose the sex operation. At Monday night’s event, there were even representatives from the hospital in Thailand who will provide the surgery of choice. This is the second Miss Trans contest to be held in Rio and the winner of this year's national competition will also go on to compete in the Miss Universe Transgender 2014 contest. Stunning: A contestant sashays onto the stage at the beauty pageant held in Rio de Janeiro's João Caetano Theatre . As the contestants made their way out onto the stage, their incredible figures resulted in a loud applause and cheers from the excited audience . Proud to be transsexuals: The high cheeked sirens flaunted their feminine curves at the Miss Trans Brazil 2013 contest on Monday . The show has grown from fielding 19 candidates last year to one with 28 competitors representing 11 of Brazil’s states. The show is sponsored by the government’s Social Assistance and Human Rights Department as part of the campaign to combat homophobic violence in the country. Marchi, a 38-year-old, transvestite, is one of the driving forces in the country fighting to change society’s negative attitudes towards those who wish to live their lives as cross-dressers or as transgender women. 'The beauty constant is essentially a political tool for us to draw attention to a section of the population that faces prejudice and is marginalised in Brazilian society on a daily basis,' explains Marchi. The victor can either undergo a sex change or have the best cosmetic facial and plastic surgery in the Far East country . 'There are still a lot of transvestites and transsexuals who suffer discrimination by being refused for a job, by not being able to use the name they choose for themselves, and by being the subject of homophobic violence and abuse,' said Marchi with a hint of anger in her voice. Behind the Miss Tran's glamorous celebration is a dark underbelly of homophobic violence in Brazil with the alarming statistic of 1,341 homosexuals murdered (LGBT – Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) in the country between 2007 and December 2012, according to records held by Groupo Gay da Bahia (GGB), the oldest organisation of its kind in the country. 'We need to bring in affirmative and inclusive public policies and to open the doors and eyes of society for the sake of transsexuals. 'In the meantime we are making ourselves very visible and hard to ignore,' Marchi adds resolutely. Flaunting it: The show is sponsored by the government's Social Assistance and Human Rights Department as part of the campaign to combat homophobic violence in the country . Most of the candidates have jobs working in the beauty industry, as models and make-up artists. But it would be wrong to conclude the competitors are only restricted to this area of employment. Sharing the catwalk are saleswomen, video editors, a psychologist and students. The crown of Miss Trans Brazil 2013 was won by Raiica Ferraz, a stunning 21-year-old hairdresser from São Paulo who tells the Mail Online that from an early age she only ever played with dolls and at 17 she challenged the taboos in her school by dressing as a woman. 'Everyone was shocked. They just stopped and starred. But I decided that this was what I wanted to do and no one was going to change my mind. 'There was a bit of teasing, but because I was very confident, it didn’t affect me and they soon gave up out of boredom,' said the 5ft 8in tall transvestite.

At Monday night's event, there were representatives from the hospital in Thailand who would provide the surgery of choice . As she accepted her prize to shouts of 'gostosa, linda, maravilhosa’ (hot, beautiful, wonderful) Ferraz revealed she doesn’t want to do the transgender surgery but will opt for cosmetic procedures to make her face even more feminine. 'I don’t need this operation, I already feel like a woman. I have been taking hormone tablets for more than four years now to create my curves and increase my bust size and I am really happy with the results,' Ferraz says confidently. 'I respect myself and because of that the people in my community and my family respect me. They are going to be so proud that I won,' she adds. Ferraz and the other contestants also have home-grown international trans-models to look up to. Brazil has recently seen a surge in the numbers of transgender models gracing the catwalk. Six-foot-tall Felipa Tavares, who is signed to the 40 degrees international model agency that discovered top super model Gisele Bunchen, is paving the way as laws in Brazil, in recent years, become more favourable to tackling gay rights.","Contestants sashayed onto the stage in pink bikinis for the Miss Trans Brazil 2013 contest held in Rio de Janeiro .

A bodybuilder who was banned from squeezing men’s muscles or asking them to do squats has targeted more young males, a court has heard. Akinwale Arobieke, 52, approached well-built men in Manchester city centre, Trafford and Bolton and touched their arms or shoulders, prosecutors allege. Mr Arobieke denies any wrongdoing and says he is being set up by ‘vindictive’ people who know about his history of offending. He was jailed for five years in 2003 for 15 charges of harassment and on his release he was given a Sexual Offences Prevention Order (SOPO). It bans him certain specific activities, including feeling a person’s muscles or getting them to carry out ‘squats’ in public. He has since been jailed three times for flouting the SOPO, and is now facing a further string of breaches at Manchester Crown Court - offences he denies. Prosecutor Michael Brady told the court: 'The complainants in this case are all young men whose physical appearance and build hold a fascination for this defendant. 'Mr Arobieke has had, and continues to have an interest in body building. 'His interest extends beyond that which is legitimate and manifests itself in a way that we say is criminal.' It’s alleged that between April and June 2011, Mr Arobieke approached a 19-year-old man in Manchester and ‘bumped into him’ before striking up a conversation. Targets: Arobieke has been accused of targeting young men in St Peter's Square, Manchester city centre, pictured, Trafford and Bolton . The man, now 20, told the jury Mr Arobieke followed him along the street and up towards the Triangle shopping centre in the city centre. The alleged victim told the court: 'He stopped in front of me and held out his arm, because I had stopped answering his questions. 'He opened his rucksack which had different body building magazines and started showing me pictures of them and asking if I knew who they were. 'He asked if I could do particular poses.' The man told how the defendant touched him on the shoulder and bicep, and said it was a ‘very uncomfortable experience’. More than year later, the man said he was approached by Mr Arobieke again several times, in St Peter’s Square. Mr Arobieke, who was defending himself, denies he ever met the man in the street and said there was no CCTV evidence that he approached him or followed him in St Peter’s Square.

'I told them I was doing a cookery demo', she said. During the interview, which airs later this month on ITV, Mary said she likes to have a spray tan and owns a onesie which has stars on it. She also remembers going to Ibiza when she was 71 and visiting the club Pacha describing it as a rabbit warren where there were funny coloured drinks.

William had decided to take the car to go and buy a newspaper with his sister Annabel. But he went around a corner too fast and was killed. Annabel escaped unhurt. After the death of her son, Mary began making programmes from home and ran cookery courses. Her daughter Annabel went on to become a Cordon Bleu certified chef and Thomas, a tree surgeon.

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 04:51 EST, 2 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:22 EST, 2 December 2013 . Decision: Home Secretary Theresa May has ordered that Hilal Al-Jedda should lose his British citizenship over alleged terror links . An Iraqi terror suspect has become the first person to have his British passport revoked twice by the Home Secretary. Hilal Al-Jedda, alleged to be an explosives expert, previously won a Supreme Court battle to have his citizenship restored, on the grounds that he had been rendered 'stateless'. But Theresa May has now ordered him to have his passport taken away again, claiming his terror links make him dangerous to the British public. The move will be welcomed by campaigners who have argued that Al-Jedda should be banned from returning to Britain. However, human rights activists have spoken out against the decision, saying that it is unfair to strip someone of citizenship if they do not have a passport from another country. Al-Jedda, 56, first came to Britain as an asylum seeker in 1992, and eight years later he and his family were granted UK citizenship. In September 2004, he travelled to Iraq, where he was captured by U.S. forces during the height of the insurgency. He spent three years in British military detention, and on his release was stripped of his citizenship by Labour Home Secretary Jacqui Smith. This prevented him from returning to the UK, and he has since been living in Turkey with his third wife and eight children. In October, the Supreme Court ruled that Al-Jedda should be given his passport back because he automatically lost his Iraqi citizenship when he became British. Judges were told that he belonged to an Islamic terrorist group which had plotted 'atrocities' against Western troops. War: Al-Jedda was captured by U.S. forces in Iraq, pictured, at the height of the insurgency in 2004 . Now Mrs May has re-opened the case by ordering that Al-Jedda should once again lose his passport. Home Office lawyers say that he could easily re-apply for Iraqi citizenship and would have to be given a passport by the country's officials. However, his own lawyers insist that he is currently stateless and the decision breaches his human rights. Solicitor Tessa Gregory told the Independent: 'Mr Al-Jedda was given less than an hour's notice of the deprivation order and has not been provided with any detail of the allegations against him save for the vaguest of references to Islamist extremism, an allegation he flatly denies.' A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'The Home Secretary has the power to remove a person's UK citizenship where she considers it is conducive to the public good. 'This individual has lodged an appeal against the Home Secretary's decision to do so in his case and it would not be appropriate to comment further while litigation is ongoing.' Mrs May has used her powers to strip suspected criminals of their British passports 20 times since the Coalition came to power in 2010. The previous Labour Government carried out the procedure just five times in 13 years, including in the case of Al-Jedda.","Hilal Al-Jedda originally lost his British passport in 2007 after three years in military detention in Iraq .

More than 20 women and children have died and dozens others were injured when traditional celebratory gunfire at a Saudi wedding brought down an electric cable causing a fire to break out. A total of 23 people - believed to be mostly women - were electrocuted when bullets caused the high-voltage power line to fall on to a metal door at the wedding in eastern Saudi Arabia. According to local news reports sparks from the cable caused an electrical fire in a women's only marquee at the wedding party in Ain Badr, near Abqaiq. Aftermath: This photograph taken after the tragedy shows a large courtyard strewn with fallen chairs . Strict rules of gender segregation in the conservative Islamic kingdom mean women are typically kept separate from men at weddings. Children at the wedding would have been with the female guests. The tragedy at the party near Abqaiq - which left at least 30 more guests injured - occurred less than a month after Saudi Arabia banned the shooting of firearms at weddings, a popular tradition in tribal areas of the conservative Islamic kingdom. Hundreds of people are understood to have been inside the courtyard of the home in Ain Badr when the blaze broke out. Eastern Province official Abdullah Khashman said all those killed were from the same tribe. A further 30 wedding guests were injured in the incident near Abqaiq, a centre of the Saudi energy industry. 'At the wedding, the cable fell on a metal door and the 23 people who died were all electrocuted,' Mr Khashman said. Eastern Province governor Prince Mohammed bin Fahd ordered an investigation into the incident, the official Saudi Press Agency said. Disaster: Hundreds of guests are understood to have been at the wedding at a home near Abqaiq in eastern Saudi . Earlier this month Saudi officials introduced a zero-tolerance policy on the culturally accepted practice of shooting firearms at weddings and other special occasions, following previous accidental deaths. Interior Minister Prince Ahmad Bin Abdul Aziz assigned police to monitor palaces, wedding halls and relaxation areas to ensure full compliance with the law, the Saudi Press Agency reported at the time. The announcement was made following an increase in fatal and serious injuries as a result of celebratory gunfire, the agency said.","Stray bullets brought down a high voltage power line at the wedding in eastern Saudi Arabia .

Critics are blasting Washington Redskins coach Mike Shanahan over his decision to play a visibly injured Robert Griffin III before he went down in an agonizing injury that made football fans across the nation cringe. Griffin, known as RGIII, appeared weaker and weaker as the game against the Seattle Seahawks wore on last night, with the fourth quarter fall as the rookie sensation's knockout punch. The scope of Griffin's injury is not yet known, and he was to undergo additional tests today - including an MRI. Now that the team is out of playoff contention, many have questioned Shanahan's decision to leave Griffin in the game, and whether he should have been on the field in the first place. Misstep: Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III twisted his knee while chasing a loose ball during the second half of the NFL wild card playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks last night . Fall: Griffin collapsed to the ground after twisting his knee in the fourth quarter . Jeopardy: Griffin is examined by team officials as he writhes in pain on the field . Griffin suffered a mild sprain of the . lateral collateral ligament located on the outside of the knee against . Baltimore on December 9, caused when he was hit by defensive tackle . Haloti Ngata at the end of a 13-yard scramble. He had been limping earlier in this game last night at Washington's FedEx field, still ailing from that injury. 'It was hard to watch RGIII tonight,' Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. 'It was hard on him. He was freaking gallant.' Despite Griffin's struggles, the quarterback was not about to accept an early exit. 'I probably would been right back out . there on the field,' Griffin said. 'You respect authority, and I respect . coach Shanahan. But at the same time, you have to step up and be a man, . sometimes. There was no way I was coming out of that game.' New York Post sports columnist Steve Serby said that despite Griffin's warrior attitude, Shanahan should have known better. Coach: Many have questioned Redskins head coach Mike Shanahan's decision to leave Griffin in the game, and whether he should have been on the field in the first place . Serby wrote: 'There are times when the coach, in his position of authority, must take that decision out of the hands of the player, and this was one of those times.' At a news conference today, Shanahan said he talked to Griffin and team doctors on the sideline after each hit during the game, and he felt confident in Griffin until the last play. A report over the weekend accused Shanahan of lying about Griffin's medical clearance to play after the December 9 injury. After that game, Shanahan claimed that team doctors had allowed Griffin to return to the field, despite spraining his lateral collateral ligament (LCL). But Dr James Andrews, a knee specialist who also serves as the Redskins' sideline doctor, told USA Today that Griffin refused an evaluation by the team's medical staff, and ran back out to the field before anyone could examine him. Dr Andrews told the paper: 'We didn't even get to touch him or talk to him. Scared the hell out of me.' There were also some concerns about the quality of the field prior to the game. The grass - or lack therof - was blamed for a separate injury to Seahawks defensive end Chris Clemons, who tore his ACL. Lingering injury: Griffin's right leg was already in a brace following an injury he suffered in a game last month . Clemons' agent, Donal Henderson, told NFL.com that the 'crappy' conditions at FedEx Field contributed to his client's troubles. In addition, Fox Sports broadcaster . Erin Andrews tweeted: 'Even before tonight's game at Fed Ex, players . were telling me just how awful the field was..there was barely any grass . at the 50' The Seahawks finally won a road playoff game, snapping an eight-game postseason skid away from home with a 24-14 NFC wild-card victory Sunday over the Redskins. 'I think I did put myself at more risk by being out there,' Griffin said. 'But every time you get on the field, you're putting yourself on the line.' Griffin didn't know what the injury was, and Shanahan said he was scheduled for an MRI to determine the extent of the injury. Sidelined: Griffin sits on the bench after his fourth quarter injury . Washington won seven straight games . to win the NFC East title and become the only team in the last 16 years . to make the playoffs after a 3-6 start. As Griffin - the No. 2 overall pick in . the 2012 draft - writhed in pain on the field, many fans stood in . silence, cupping their hands over their faces as Griffin was being . attended to. Several of Griffin's Redskins teammates also stood around the quarterback to see if he was OK. Though Griffin walked off the field under his own power after several minutes and saluted the fans, the Redskins (10-7) quickly announced he would not return. Concern: A Redskins fan reacts as quarterback Griffin went down during the game . 'If you didn't pull him out then, you should get fired,' Shanahan said. Griffin . went to the locker room to get checked out after going down in a heap . in the fourth quarter, but walked back out a few minutes later and stood . on the sideline as only a spectator for the rest of the game. Seattle's Steven Hauschka kicked his third field goal of the game, and backup quarterback Kirk Cousins couldn't pull off the late-game heroics he displayed a few weeks ago against the Ravens when Griffin was first injured. Griffin was playing in his third game since spraining his right knee against Baltimore, which also brought Cousins into that game. While setting a rookie quarterback record with 815 rushing yards this season, Griffin captivated the D.C. area - and the football world - with his dazzling ability to pass and run. After four straight last-place finishes in the NFC East, the Redskins appear to have a bright future. As long as Griffin stays healthy, of course. Sunday's game was only the second playoff contest in NFL history between rookie quarterbacks, and before his injury, Griffin looked more like a first-year player than he had during Washington's impressive run to end the regular season. He completed 10 of 19 passes for 84 yards with two touchdowns and an interception and ran for 21 yards on five carries. 'I don't feel like me being out there hurt the team in any way,' Griffin said. 'I'm the best option.' Shanahan said he spoke with Griffin throughout the game about the quarterback's health. 'He said, ""Hey, trust me. I want to be in there, and I deserve to be in there,"" Shanahan said. 'I couldn't disagree with him.'

"By . James  Nye . and Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:00 EST, 20 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:33 EST, 20 November 2013 . The Neo-Nazi serial killer who targeted blacks and Jews and paralyzed pornographer Larry Flynt in 1978 has been executed. Early this morning, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the appeal of two last-minute stays of execution granted to Joseph Paul Franklin over the single drug Missouri planned to use in his execution. Less than one hour later, at 6.17am CST, Franklin's death sentence was carried out with an injection of pentobarbital at the state prison in Bonne Terre, Missouri. It was Missouri's first execution in three years and the first using the single drug - a sedative that caused the accidental overdose of Michael Jackson. Through the years: Joseph Paul Franklin as seen in a series of booking photos from 2005 to 2012 . Pentobarbital is starting to replace . three-drug lethal injection cocktails that had previously been used . because drug manufacturers . will no longer provide them to US prisons. Franklin rejected his last meal. He also made no statement before his execution and said nothing in the death chamber. As he was injected with the drug, he blinked, breathed heavily, swallowed hard and slipped away within minutes, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Franklin . had been convicted of murdering seven people and admitted to killing up . 22 during a cross-country reign of terror that lasted from 1977 through . 1980. Franklin was a . sniper motivated by racism. He targeted blacks and Jews and whites who . were seen mingling with members of other races. A paranoid schizophrenic, Franklin claimed he wanted to start a race war. Franklin's fate was sealed early Wednesday when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a federal appeals court ruling that overturned two stays granted Tuesday evening by district court judges in Missouri. The Missouri Department of Correction wasted no time in executing him. Of all the killings Franklin admitted to, it was for the 1977 sniper shooting of Gerald Gordon at a suburban St. Louis synagogue that he was executed. Tools of hate: This grab from CNN shows the rifle and guitar case carried by the notorious serial killer . Mentally detached: Mr Franklin's lawyer says he was likely unaware he was on death row . Authorities provided no account of execution, except to say that he died at 6.17am CST. A . federal judge had ruled Tuesday afternoon that a lawsuit filed on . behalf of Mr Franklin and 20 other Missouri inmates on death row arguing . the dangers of propofol must be resolved before anyone can be executed. Lawyers for the . serial killer have argued the drug can cause contamination and pain . above and beyond thresholds allowed by the Eight Amendment - which . prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. The . judge on Tuesday agreed, writing that the state 'has not provided any . information about the certification, inspection history, infraction . history, or other aspects of the compounding pharmacy or of the person . compounding the drug.' A . separate ruling from another judge Tuesday called Mr Franklin's mental capacity . into question, and said his mental illness should be reviewed before he . is put to death. His mental state is such that he wasn't even aware he was on death row. 'He was happy,' his attorney told the Salt Lake Tribune. 'I’m not really convinced that he totally understands that he was going to die.' Mr Franklin earlier this week confirmed to CNN he was responsible for . the cold-blooded execution-style deaths of 'approximately' 22 people. He was devoid of emotion as he attempted to justify his killings - . which famously included an attempt on the life of Hustler porn supremo . Larry Flynt - who incredibly tried to stop his shooters execution. Following his 1980 arrest, Mr Franklin told detectives that he selected the St Louis synagogue from the Yellow Pages of the telephone directory because he wanted to 'find a Jew and kill him,' according to reports. The white supremacist was also convicted in the 1977 killing of an interracial couple in Madison, Wisconsin, as well as in the 1980 shooting deaths of two black joggers in Salt Lake City. Mr Franklin's other convictions include the murders of a two teenage black boys and the bombing a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1977. 'I felt like I was at war. The survival of the white race was at stake,' he told Kyung Lah of CNN in an interview that was to be his last before being executed. 'I consider it my mission, my three-year mission. Same length of time Jesus was on his mission, from the time he was 30 to 33.' Death row: Joseph Paul Franklin is scheduled to . die by lethal injection at 12.01am on Wednesday for the sniper killing . of 42-year-old Gerald Gordon outside a suburban St. Louis synagogue in . 1977 . Investigators believe his cross-country crime spree was fueled by a hatred of blacks and Jews. Mr Franklin confessed collared in 1980 after the Salt Lake City killings. Among his alleged crimes were two high-profile shootings — of civil rights leader Vernon Jordan in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1980, and the man he calls his 'old pal' - porn mogul Larry Flynt, in Lawrenceville, Georgia, in 1978. Both men survived. Mr Franklin told CNN he believed he was going to start a race war and that his preferred method to kill his victims was to stalk them and set up a sniper's nest from which he pick them off using a high-powered rifle. Seemingly still in denial, Mr Franklin tried to blame his rough childhood on his three-year orgy of violence. Offending magazine: These are the front covers from the 1975 edition of Hustler magazine that enraged Joseph Paul Franklin . 'My momma didn't care about us,' he said, as he complained he wasn't fed properly and not allowed to play with other children. Finding another family in the white supremacist groups in the American South in the 1960s, Mr Franklin felt he found his calling after reading Adolf Hitler's political manifesto 'Mein Kampf'. 'I've never felt that way about any other book that I read,' he said, 'it was something weird about that book.' At 26, he changed his name to Joseph Paul Franklin to honor Nazi propaganda minister Paul Joseph Goebbels and founding father Benjamin Franklin. He even attempted to link himself to infamous serial killer Charles Manson by having the words 'Helter Skelter' tattooed on his arm in reference to |Mr Manson's inspiration provided by The Beatles 'White Album'. The tattoo artist rebuffed the attempt, the tattoo never came. Mr Franklin explained that he hoped his early murders would set an example to other would-be soldiers in his one-man war on minorities. Hatred: . The neo-nazi has also been convicted of killing an interracial couple . in Madison, Wisconsin in 1977, two black joggers in Salt Lake City in . 1980 and bombing a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1977 . 'I figured once I started doing it and showed them how, other white supremacists would do the same thing.' Mr Franklin then shockingly claimed minorities he once targeted now have a kinship with him. 'When you commit a crime against a certain group of people, a bonding takes place. It seems like you belong to them,' he said. In addition to the murder of Mr Gordon outside a bar mitzvah, Mr Franklin was convicted of killing Alphonse Manning and Toni Schwean in Madison, Wisconsin, because they were an interracial couple. He also confessed to shooting dead college student Rebecca Bergstrom, after she told him in passing that she dated a Jamaican man. His most shocking murder was that of 13-year-old Dante Evans and his cousin 14-year-old Darrell Lane in Cincinnati -  two African Americans jogging with white female friends. Joseph Deters, who prosecuted that Cincinnati case said, 'He's just a creep. There's no other way to describe him. And what he did to those two kids because of the color of their skin is incomprehensible.' Victim: Larry Flynt says he doesn't to see the man who shot him put to death . Hustler chief Flynt was standing trial on an obscenity charge in Georgia in 1978 when he was wounded by a sniper's bullet. No one was arrested at the time, but the shooting has since been linked to Mr Franklin. Gwinnett County, Ga., District Attorney Danny Porter said he is convinced Franklin shot Flynt because Franklin provided information only the shooter would know — details about the shooting location, the type of weapon used, even the maker of the gun. The details were divulged while the killer served time in the 1990s in a Georgia prison. Mr Franklin said he shot the pornographer because of a magazine front cover showing an interracial couple. 'I saw that interracial couple he had, photographed there, having sex,' he told CNN, referring to the December 1975 issue of Hustler . 'It just made me sick. I think whites marry with whites, blacks with blacks, Indians with Indians. Orientals with orientals. I threw the magazine down and thought, I'm gonna kill that guy.' However, Mr Porter said he opted against filing charges because Franklin had already been convicted of multiple killings and said it didn't make sense to bring him back to Georgia to face trial for shooting Mr Flynt. Incredibly, the Hustler founder has become an unlikely supporter of Franklin's - in so much as he doesn't want him to face the death penalty. Mr Flynt would rather his shooter rot away in a prison cell. 'The government has no business at all being in the business of killing people,' said Flynt. '(It's) much more punishment to put somebody in prison for the rest of their lives than it is to snip their life out in a few seconds with a lethal injection.' Mr Flynt's sadistic hopes have been kept alive for the time being.","Joseph Paul Franklin admitted to killing 22 people across multiple states between 1977 and 1980 .

Secret documents about the inquiry into the Profumo Affair could eventually be released - but possibly not for another 50 years, it emerged today. They examine former war minister John Profumo’s affair with 19-year-old Christine Keeler in 1961 which happened while she was also in a relationship with Russian military attache Yevgeny Ivanov. One major element of interest is whether the files - which were declared too sensitive for even the head of MI5 to read - hold the names of any other ministers in Harold Macmillan's government. Scandal: The papers examine ex-war minister John Profumo's (left) affair with Christine Keeler (right) in 1961 . Top judge Lord Denning looked at whether Britain's Cold War security had been compromised when he carried out the Government's inquiry into the scandal, reported The Daily Telegraph. The Denning Inquiry was a bestseller upon its publication in 1963, although critics lamented it as a cover-up designed to protect the Establishment. Background files - including notes from Lord Denning's interviews with 160 witnesses - have been kept secret in the Cabinet Office for more than half a century. Now, Lord Wallace of Saltaire - the spokesman for the Cabinet Office in the Lords – has revealed the papers will be given ‘permanent preservation’ status, raising hopes they will one day be released. Cold War era: Keeler was in a relationship with Russian military attache Yevgeny Ivanov (left), and she was introduced to Profumo by Stephen Ward (right), a high-society osteopath and portrait-painter . Inquiry: Top judge Lord Denning looked at whether Britain's Cold War security had been compromised when he carried out the Government's inquiry into the scandal . Lord Wallace told the peer and historian Professor Peter Hennessy in a written parliamentary answer that there were ‘some sensational personal items’ in the documents. 'My guess it they will put at the very least 75 years on it, which would be 2039' Prof Peter Hennessy, peer and historian . And Prof Hennessy told the Daily Telegraph: ‘If it is selected for permanent preservation, it can only mean eventual release - because if it's never going to be released, you wouldn't preserve it. ‘My guess it they will put at the very least 75 years on it, which would be 2039. But I wouldn't be surprised at all if they put 100 years on it, making it January 1, 2064.’ The scandal happened at the height of the Cold War when it was discovered that Keeler had been sleeping with both Profumo and Ivanov, a naval attache based at the Russian Embassy in London. Flashback: The Daily Mail's front page on March 22, 1963, with a picture of Keeler - who is described in a quote from Labour MP Reginald Paget as a 'very pretty girl' Keeler, a model, and Profumo began their affair after being introduced at a party at the Cliveden estate in 1961 by their mutual friend Stephen Ward, a high-society osteopath and portrait-painter. Profumo, who was married to actress Valerie Hobson, had no idea that Keeler was also sleeping with Ivanov. In March 1963 he told the House of Commons that rumours of his affair were untrue. But he was forced to resign three months later after admitting lying. Ward, who was prosecuted for living off immoral earnings, took an overdose the day before his trial ended and died in August 1963. Keeler was found guilty of unrelated perjury charges and was sentenced to nine months in prison.","Ex-war minister John Profumo had affair with Christine Keeler in 1961 .

Mankind should consider extreme options - such as taking pills to wean . humanity away from eating meat or genetically engineering ourselves to . be smaller - in order to reduce our ecological footprint, says a leading . philosopher. From reducing our reliance on fossil fuels to finding more energy-efficient ways to travel, the push is on for humans to combat the threat of global climate change. But the ways in which we change our behaviour - either culturally or through technology - are still up for debate. Engineering of the future: Could we re-wire humans to be intolerant of meat and less of a drain on our planet's resources? Professor Matthew Liao of New York University has outlined some of the dramatic ways we can alter our future. Professor Matthew Liao suggests we debate new methods to reduce our damage to the environment . He and his co-authors make suggestions ranging from providing pills that give people an aversion to eating meat to genetic engineering or hormone therapy so that parents give birth to smaller, less resource-intensive children. Their paper, to be published in Ethics, Policy & Environment, lists techniques which many people will be uncomfortable with. But Liao and his co-writers,  Anders Sandberg and Rebecca Roache, stress that they are not advocating any of these approaches, just offering them up for discussion as to the pros and cons, and they also stressed their support for individual choice. Speaking about his paper to The Atlantic magazine, Liao said market solutions, such as carbon pricing, were not necessarily enough to solve the problems facing humanity. He said: 'So far it seems like it's pretty difficult to orchestrate workable international agreements to affect international emissions trading. 'The Kyoto Protocol, for instance, has not produced demonstrable reductions in global emissions, and in any event demand for petrol and for electricity seems to be pretty inelastic. And so it's questionable whether carbon taxation alone can deliver the kind of reduction that we need to really take on climate change.' World in our hands: There's little we can do to destroy the planet, but we may be able to destroy our place within it . Regarding the controversial geo-engineering idea, he said that there were inherent risks with the suggestion, in regards to it being an untested technology and the unforeseen consequences of trying it on a global scale. He said: 'You have to worry that by implementing these techniques we could endanger ourselves or future generations. 'For example it's been suggested that we could alter the reflectivity of the atmosphere using sulfate aerosol so as to turn away a portion of the sun's heat, but it could be that doing so would destroy the ozone layer, which would obviously be problematic. 'Others have argued that we ought to fertilize the ocean with iron, because doing so might encourage a massive bloom of carbon-sucking plankton. 'But doing so could potentially render the ocean inhospitable to fish, which would obviously also be quite problematic. ' Attempts at fiddling with nature, either environmentally or genetically, have been risky in the past. For instance, the introduction of new animals almost always adversely affects the local fauna, such as when rabbits were introduced to Australia in the 18th century - which quickly escaped their pens and decimated wide swathes of the country. However, in terms of the benefits, Liao said: 'One of the things that we noticed is that human ecological . footprints are partly correlated with size. 'Each kilogram of body mass . requires a certain amount of food and nutrients and so, other things . being equal, the larger person is the more food and energy they are . going to soak up over the course of a lifetime. 'There are also other, . less obvious ways in which larger people consume more energy than . smaller people - for example a car uses more fuel per mile to carry a . heavier person, more fabric is needed to clothe larger people, and . heavier people wear out shoes, carpets and furniture at a quicker rate . than lighter people, and so on. 'If you reduce the average U.S. height by just . 15cm, you could reduce body mass by 21 per cent for men and 25 per cent for women, with a . corresponding reduction in metabolic rates by some 15 per cent to 18 per cent, because . less tissue means lower energy and nutrient needs.' Inefficient energy: Liao suggests more than 50 per cent of greenhouse emissions come from our dependence on livestock farming, based on reports from the U.N. When questioned about the use of pills or engineering to break humanity's heavy use of meat in our diet, Liao said: 'There is a widely cited U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization report that estimates that 18 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 equivalents come from livestock farming, which is actually a much higher share than from transportation. 'More recently it's been suggested that livestock farming accounts for as much as 51 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. 'And then there are estimates that as much as 9 per cent of human emissions occur as a result of deforestation for the expansion of pastures for livestock. 'And that doesn't even to take into account the emissions that arise from manure, or from the livestock directly. 'Since a large portion of these cows and other grazing animals are raised for consumption, it seems obvious that reducing the consumption of these meats could have considerable environmental benefits.' 'I think it's important to note that it wouldn't necessarily need to be a pill. We have also toyed around with the idea of a patch that might stimulate the immune system to reject common bovine proteins, which could lead to a similar kind of lasting aversion to meat products.'","NYU professor suggests we genetically engineer babies to be smaller and more 'energy-efficient'

The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency has ruled Iran has stopped enriching uranium to 20 per cent. Hassan Rouhani's nation has always insisted the process was for energy purposes only . Iran has halted its quest for weapons-grade uranium, according to the UNâ€™s International Atomic Energy Agency. Inspectors from the IAEA reported that Iran had stopped enriching uranium to 20 per cent purity, which is just one step away from the material required for a viable nuclear weapon. The move, which comes after Novemberâ€™s talks between Iran and leading nations in Geneva, marks the first stage of an agreement that could open the way for sanctions on the oil-dependent regime to be eased. Tehran has always insisted that its uranium enrichment was for energy purposes, despite Western concern. The United States and European Union both suspended some trade and other restrictions against the OPEC oil producer after the United Nations' nuclear watchdog confirmed that Iran had fulfilled its side of an agreement made on November 24. The announcements, which coincided with a diplomatic row over Iran's role at peace talks on Syria, will allow six months of negotiation. Under the interim deal, Iran agreed to suspend enrichment of uranium to a fissile concentration of 20 percent, a short technical step away from the level needed for nuclear weapons. It also has to dilute or convert its stockpile of this higher-grade uranium, and cease work on the Arak heavy water reactor, which could provide plutonium, an alternative to uranium for bombs. The IAEA said Tehran had begun the dilution process and that enrichment of uranium to 20 percent had been stopped at the two facilities where such work is done. 'The Agency confirms that, as of January 20, 2014, Iran has ceased enriching uranium above five percent U-235 at the two cascades at the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant (PFEP) and four cascades at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP) previously used for this purpose,' its report to member states said. It was referring to Iran's two enrichment plants, at Natanz and Fordow. Cascades are linked networks of centrifuge machines that spin uranium gas to increase the concentration of U-235, the isotope used in nuclear fission chain reactions, which is found in nature at concentrations of less than one percent. The announcement coincided with a diplomatic row at the UN, hosted by Ban Ki-Moon, over Iran's role in the Syria peace talks . However, analysts said much was still unclear about how world powers could achieve their goal of ensuring Iran cannot, secretly or otherwise, develop the capability to build a nuclear weapon. Mark Dubowitz, head of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington and a proponent of tough sanctions on Iran, said that by providing short-term economic relief, the West was losing future bargaining power with Tehran. 'The interim deal does nothing over the next 12 months to prevent Iran from proceeding with the nuclear-weapon and ballistic-missile research that are the keys to a deliverable nuclear weapon,' he said. 'Ahead of final negotiations, Tehran will be in a stronger position to block peaceful Western efforts to dismantle its military-nuclear programme.'","Move follows November talks warning oil-rich nation to take action .

Quentin Tarantino is suing Gawker Media for allegedly disseminating a copy of his script for prospective new film The Hateful Eight. The 50-year-old director filed a lawsuit on Monday alleging . contributory copyright infringement after Gawker's Defamer blog posted a link to another site with the caption: 'Here Is the Leaked Quentin Tarantino Hateful Eight Script.' The Oscar-winning screenwriter was so furious at the leak, which happened last week, that he threatened to halt production on The Hateful Eight, described as a 70mm ensemble Western. Lawsuit: Quentin Tarantino, pictured with a friend at Sunday's Grammy Awards, furious after his screenplay for The Hateful Eight was leaked to two websites . According to The Hollywood Reporter, Tarantino's complaint states: 'This action is necessitated by Gawker Media’s, and the other defendants’, blatant copyright infringement by their promotion and dissemination of unauthorized downloadable copies of the leaked unreleased complete screenplay for Quentin Tarantino’s motion picture The Hateful Eight. 'Gawker Media has made a . business of predatory journalism, violating people’s rights to make a . buck. This time they went too far. 'Rather than merely publishing a news . story reporting that Plaintiff’s screenplay may have been circulating in . Hollywood without his permission, Gawker Media crossed the journalistic . line by promoting itself to the public as the first source to read the . entire Screenplay illegally.' The lawsuit then complains about the use of 'multiple direct links' to an 'anonymous URL' which were posted via Defamer and also on the Gawker website. It criticises Gawker's invitation for the reader to 'enjoy' reading the script. Refute: Gawker posted its own response on Monday to Tarantino's lawsuit . It further alleges that Gawker ignored repeated requests to remove the links to the screenplay. Oscar winning: The director is famed for his screenplays, having won two Academy Awards . In a response to the allegations, Gawker published a post on Monday refuting any suggestion they 'leaked' the script . themselves. They claim they were merely reporting that the . screenplay existed on two different websites. Gawker mention that Tarantino himself told Deadline in an interview that he 'likes' his scripts to be available for fans to critique on the Internet, although admittedly, the Deadline piece states that the director 'can't believe' it happened this early in the film making process. 'I am not talking out of both sides of my mouth, because I do like the fact that everyone eventually posts it, gets it and reviews it on the net,' the director told Deadline. 'Frankly, I wouldn’t want it any other way. I like the fact that people like my s***, and that they go out of their way to find it and read it. But I gave it to six motherf***** people! Starting this week, I’ll be setting meetings with publishers.' Gawker also alleges the leaked script is part of a 'shrewd publicity' strategy' by the director and insists it 'published a link to the script because it was news.' They add: 'The leak of The Hateful Eight - and . the content of the script - had been widely dissected online and was a . topic of heated conversation among Defamer readers. 'News of the fact . that it existed on the internet advanced a story that Tarantino himself . had launched, and our publication of the link was a routine and . unremarkable component of our job: making people aware of news and . information about which they are curious.' Gawker are also vehement they had . 'nothing to do with the appearance of The Hateful Eight script on the . internet' and have 'no idea' how the websites in question got hold of the . script. Tarantino told Deadline last Tuesday that he was 'very very depressed' about the leak. 'I finished a script, a first draft, and I . didn’t mean to shoot it until next winter, a year from now. I gave it . to six people, and apparently it’s gotten out today,' he said. I like your work: Tarantino favourite Christoph Waltz was reportedly being courted for a role in the Western . He found out about the leak when his agent started fielding calls from representatives looking to tout their clients for a role in the film. 'I gave it to one of the producers on .

There is an ugly maliciousness to the rest of it. I gave it to . three actors: Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, Tim Roth. The one I know . didn’t do this is Tim Roth. 'One of the others let their agent read it, and that agent has now passed it on to everyone in Hollywood.' According to The Wrap, . actors Christoph Waltz  was being courted for a role, but was never . given the script. Neither was Samuel L.

Enjoying the genre: Tarantino said he wanted to made another Western after his experience shooting Django Unchained which starred Christoph Waltz and Jamie Foxx . Tarantino said he suspects the leak came from Dern's agency, CAA. However, a representative for the agency 'vehemently denied' any involvement when asked by Deadline, pointing out that the script lacked the customary watermark used for security purposes. The Django Unchained screenwriter then said he would publish the script and revisit it down the road as a potential movie. 'I’ll move on to the next thing. I’ve got 10 more where that came from,' he said about his next possible project. Tarantino's next project may be a prison film, according to The Wrap, who reported that he has been researching details about actor Robert Blake's acquittal for the murder of his wife Bonny Lee Bakley in 2001.

A woman who has suffered from constant hiccups for more than a decade says she is in despair over her condition. Amanda Corby, 46, of Hull, has bouts of hiccups five times a day every day, leaving doctors baffled. She hiccups every two seconds in episodes that can last up to ten minutes at a time. Scroll down for video . Despair: Amanda Corby has suffered from constant hiccups for more than a decade. Doctors cannot work out how to treat her condition . Hiccups are a result of the layer of muscle below the ribcage, known as the diaphragm, suddenly and involuntarily contracting. Long-lasting hiccups can be caused by . underlying problems such as gastrointestinal or respiratory conditions, . or psychological stresses such as anxiety, fear, grief or shock. In some . cases, they can be treated with anesthetics or anti-inflammatory . medication. Complications can include insomnia, weight loss, exhaustion and depression. This means that since the problem began in 2003, she has hiccuped approximately three million times. Hiccups are a result of the layer of muscle below the ribcage, known as the diaphragm, suddenly and involuntarily contracting. She said: 'I’ve tried scaring myself and sipping water - all the old tricks, but nothing works for me. 'I tried hypnosis once which stopped the hiccups for three months, but then they started up again. I’m out of ideas as to what to try next.' Miss Corby, who works in a bingo hall, says her ailment has caused mirth among colleagues and customers. She said: 'They began one day while I was at work. When I had more episodes the next day, I wondered whether it was something I was eating. Ongoing: Since her problem began in 2003, Miss Corby has hiccuped approximately three million times . 'They continued for the rest of the week. Weeks turned into months and years. They haven’t stopped yet. An inventor claims to have developed a device that stops the hiccups every time. It . is little more than a plastic stick with a hole in the middle. The user . bites down on the stick and drinks a glass of water through the hole. It . appears the hiccups are stopped by the combination of drinking the . water and biting the stick, which makes the throat muscles tense. The . idea was developed after inventor Chuck Ray had a bout of hiccups and . decided to experiment by drinking a glass of water with a pen in his . mouth – and it eased his symptoms. He said: ‘They didn’t stop immediately but it was enough to make me believe I was on to something.’ More than 10,000 Hiccup Sticks have now been sold at a cost of £13 for a pack of three online. However not all doctors are convinced by Californian Mr Ray’s idea, pointing out that hiccups normally subside anyway. 'Other . staff members have made a bit of a joke about it, and I tend to laugh . along. But there are moments where it’s quite embarrassing, particularly . when I’m in front of customers. 'At those times I really wish the problem go away forever.' Six months after the bouts began, Miss Corby saw her GP in the hope of discovering the cause of her hiccups and whether they could be cured. She said: 'They tend to occur when I’m at work and I can feel when they going to start. At first I thought it was something I ate or drank, but then I realised I don’t eat or drink during a shift, so it can’t be that. 'The doctor didn’t know what to tell me. He just suggested I take sips of water but he wasn’t able to explain why the hiccups had started or what could make them go away.' Long-lasting hiccups can be caused by underlying problems such as gastrointestinal or respiratory conditions, or psychological stresses such as anxiety, fear, grief or shock. In some cases they can be treated with anesthetics or anti-inflammatory medication. Complications can include insomnia, weight loss, exhaustion and depression. Miss Corby said: 'I don’t see the point in going back for medical help. I don’t think anyone will be able to help me. 'A hypnotherapist trained me to imagine . putting the hiccups away into a box, and putting that box away forever. By filing away the hiccups like that, I seemed to be able to control . them. Cure: Miss Corby has even tried hypnotherapy, but this only helped for a few months . 'Perhaps longer sessions of hypnotherapy would work, but if they’re just going to start up again in a few weeks, I don’t really think it’s worth it. 'It would be helpful to talk to someone who knows what it’s like, but I don’t know anyone else who has this problem. 'I expect I’ll just have to live with it.' The world record for hiccups is still held by Charles Osborne, an American who died in 1991. He endured 68 years of regular hiccuping between 1922 and 1990. In his case, the hiccups began after a pig fell on him.","Amanda Corby, from Hull, has bouts of hiccups five times a day every day .

By end seven, the Canadians were racing for the finish, playing a tight game to prevent Britain's curlers from closing the gap. Team GB had the hammer, but the Buff Boy's took every chance to knock away scoring and blocking stones, safe in the knowledge they were benefitting from an almost unassailable lead. Holding a six shot advantage with just three ends to go all they had to do was make sure they didn't make any mistakes. And even the simplest of shots proved elusive for GB. The Canadians had dominated play right from the kick off this afternoon, with blistering shots and masterful tactical play that left GB with few options.

At the close of each end, GB skip Murdoch was left with tricky shots to make, but often seemed as though he was trying to hard. But while with each advancing end Britain's hopes sagged, the Canadians became more determined. Murdoch and teammates Mike Goodfellow, Scott Andrews and Greg Drummond found themselves with a mountain to climb and, every time they seemed make headway, they once again slipped on the ice. After a disastrous first end, the second was more evenly matched, but David Murdoch's all-Scots rink were unable to come level with Brad Jacob's Buff Boys who made a blistering start. The Canadians, clad in grey and black with their nation's characteristic maple leaf insignia, dominated the first part of the match, knocking GB's stones all over the ice. Despite several good moves from Britain's skip Murdoch, Team GB, dressed in white found themselves in a tricky position after just five deliveries.

In the third . end it was clear that Canada was also benefiting from a large heap of . luck, with several poorly delivered shots nevertheless coming in on . target.

Swedish . captain Niklas Edin had made the first mistake of their sem-final clash . with Britain's curlers in the second end, too strong with his final . shot which gave GB a steal of one point to put them ahead. However, . the Swedes responded immediately with two and Murdoch had levelled by . the halfway point but having passed the hammer – the final throw of the . end – to the world champions. David Murdoch and Team Great Britain celebrate after beating Sweden: The win has clinched them at least silver . Another mistake by Edin with his last throw in the sixth end – he went for a game-changing three instead of the easier one and ended up handing a point to GB – had Murdoch's side back in front again. Edin again erred in the seventh when his penultimate stone left him only able to level and that suggested that things had turned in GB's favour. They forged ahead by one in the eighth. Sweden grabbed a two in the ninth to go 5-4 up to set up a tense final end with Edin's last throw, slack again, leaving Murdoch a chance for glory by taking a two. The GB skip, who had a thrilling last-stone win in the tie-break against Norway, was once again bang on target to the cheers of the small knot of British fans.","Canada's Buff Boys dominated play right from the beginning .

A spokeswoman for a Texas hospital says it won't say on Saturday whether it plans to appeal a judge's order to take a pregnant brain-dead woman off of life support. J.R. Labbe says John Peter Smith Hospital won't announce a decision Saturday but she didn't say when it might. A judge gave the Fort Worth hospital until Monday at 5 p.m. to comply with his ruling to remove Marlise Munoz from life support, which her husband Erick Munoz says she would have wanted. This is a photo of Munoz with her first baby. She was pregnant with her second when she collapsed . She was 14 weeks pregnant when her husband found her unconscious Nov. 26, possibly due to a blood clot. The hospital says it has a legal duty to protect the fetus and is considering an appeal. John Peter Smith Hospital spokeswoman J.R. Labbe said 'discussions are ongoing' as administrators weigh the order issued a day earlier by Judge R. H. Wallace Jr. The hospital is owned by Tarrant County and is being represented in the contentious case by the DA's office. The judge's ruling could give Erick Munoz a long-awaited chance to bury his wife and move forward to care for their son and his relatives. It would also mean the fetus would never be born. Both the hospital and the family agree that Marlise Munoz meets the criteria to be considered brain-dead - which means she is dead both medically and under Texas law - and that the fetus could not be born alive this early in pregnancy. But while the hospital says it's obligated to protect the fetus, Munoz contends his wife would not have wanted to be kept in this condition. And his attorneys have said medical records show the fetus is 'distinctly abnormal.' The case has raised questions about end-of-life care and whether a pregnant woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on life support for the sake of a fetus. It also has gripped attention on both sides of the abortion debate, with anti-abortion groups arguing Munoz's fetus deserves a chance to be born. Several anti-abortion advocates attended Friday's hearing. Erik Munoz says his wife wouldn't have wanted to keep living in her condition . Hospital officials have said they were bound by the Texas Advance Directives Act, which prohibits withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from a pregnant patient. But in his brief ruling, Wallace said that 'Mrs. Munoz is dead,' meaning that the hospital was misapplying the law. The ruling did not mention the fetus. The hospital has not pronounced her dead and has continued to treat her over the objections of both Erick Munoz and her parents, who sat together in court Friday. Larry Thompson, a state's attorney representing the public hospital, told the judge Friday that the hospital recognized the Munoz family's pain and rights, but said it had a greater legal responsibility to protect the fetus. 'There is a life involved, and the life is the unborn child,' Thompson said. As Wallace gave his ruling, Erick Munoz embraced his wife's parents and one of his attorneys. Munoz declined to comment as he left court Friday. But he told The Associated Press earlier this month, in a phone interview sitting in the hospital room, that he and his wife were both paramedics who knew they didn't want to stay on life support this way. The Couple is pictured here with their first son Matteo. The fetus Munoz is currently carrying has been deemed 'abnormal' Munoz described in a signed affidavit filed Thursday what it was like to see her now: her glassy, 'soulless' eyes; and the smell of her perfume replaced by what he knows to be the smell of death. He said he's tried to hold her hand but can't. 'Her limbs have become so stiff and rigid due to her deteriorating condition that now, when I move her hands, her bones crack, and her legs are nothing more than dead weight,' Munoz said. Jessica Hall Janicek and Heather King, Erick Munoz's attorneys, accused the hospital of conducting a 'science experiment' and warned of the dangerous precedent her case could set, raising the specter of special ICUs for brain-dead women carrying babies. 'There is an infant, and a dead person serving as a dysfunctional incubator,' King told the judge. King and Janicek did not say what they would do next, pending a potential appeal by the hospital, and they didn't respond to phone messages left for them Saturday. Erick Munoz filed suit against John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas to force the hospital to remove the life support keeping his pregnant brain dead wife alive . The hospital said in a statement that it 'appreciates the potential impact of the consequences of the order on all parties involved"" and was deciding whether to appeal. The hospital argued in a court filing Thursday that there was little evidence of what state lawmakers and courts thought of this issue, but recent laws passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature to restrict abortion made it clear that they wanted to preserve a fetus' rights. The Advance Directives Act 'must convey legislative intent to protect the unborn child, 'the hospital said in its filing. 'Otherwise the Legislature would have simply allowed a pregnant patient to decide to let her life, and the life of her unborn child, end.' Not much is known about fetal survival when mothers suffer brain death during pregnancy. German doctors who searched for such cases found 30 of them in nearly 30 years, according to an article published in the journal BMC Medicine in 2010. Those mothers were further along in pregnancy - 22 weeks on average - when brain death occurred than in the Texas case. Birth results were available for 19 cases. In 12, a viable child was born. Follow-up results were available for six, all of whom developed normally.

Daily consumption of sugary drinks raises a woman's chances of suffering a blood clot on the brain . Women who treat themselves to a fizzy drink every day may be increasing their risk of a life-threatening stroke, new research shows. Daily consumption of sugary drinks raises a woman’s chances of suffering a blood clot on the brain by about 80 per cent, Japanese scientists found. But there was only a very slight increase in risk for men. The findings, by a team of experts at Osaka University, partly support US research published earlier this year, which found both sugar-sweetened drinks and low-calorie alternatives raised the chances of strokes in both sexes. British consumers get through an estimated 14 billion litres of soft drinks every year and consumption has more than doubled since the mid-1980s. Numerous studies have linked rising consumption with the increased rate of obesity and type two diabetes, both of which are risk factors for strokes. But few studies have examined the precise link between consumption of fizzy beverages and the rate of brain blood clots. Strokes kill around 200 people every day in the UK. Many more are left disabled and living in fear that a second or even third attack could kill them. It’s estimated to cost the NHS £2.3 billion a year to treat and look after the 100,000 people annually struck down by the life-threatening condition. Around 85 per cent of stroke victims are affected by ischaemic strokes, where a clot travels to the brain and shuts off its blood supply . Only cancer and heart disease kill more people. Around 85 per cent of victims are affected by ischaemic strokes, where a clot travels to the brain and shuts off its blood supply. The rest are called haemorrhagic strokes, where a blood vessel bursts in the brain, causing potentially fatal bleeding. The Osaka team tracked almost 40,000 men and women aged between 40 and 59 over an 18-year period, documenting dietary habits, including consumption of soft drinks. During that period, almost 2,000 of the volunteers suffered a stroke. They analysed drinking habits of the stroke victims and compared them with those who did not develop clots. The results, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, showed women who had a daily soft drink were 83 per cent more likely to suffer an ischaemic stroke - where a clot shuts off blood supply to the brain - than women who rarely or never had one. The researchers said they found no link with haemorrhagic strokes or heart disease. In a report on their findings they said: ‘Soft drink intake was positively associated with risk of ischaemic stroke for women.’","Daily consumption significantly raises risk of ischaemic stroke - where a clot shuts off blood supply to the brain .

Dividing wine into the good and the barely drinkable is nothing new, according to a recent archaeological discovery. An ancient wine label that dates from the days of King Solomon, reveals the contents of a jar was lousy plonk intended for slaves and sheds new light on society at the time. The label is thought to be the most ancient Hebrew engraving to emerge from the archaeological digs in Jerusalem to date. The word on the pitcher reads 'yayin' or wine and he believes it should read 'in the year [¿ ]M, wine, part, m[¿]' in a form of ancient Hebrew, according to professor Galil . A rare trove of coins and jewellery was found buried near temple Mount in Jerusalem in September 2013. It included 36 gold coins dating back to the seventh century with images of Byzantine emperors and a 10cm medallion etched with a  Menorah, Shofar made from a Ram's horn and a Torah scroll. A 3,000-year-old earthenware jug was found - which is the same one that has now been deciphered. The discovery was made in the ruins of a Byzantine public structure located in the Ophel region - between the city of David and around 50 metres from the southern wall of the First Temple. Temple Mount is considered one of the most religious sites in Jerusalem and is where two biblical Jewish temples once stood. It is also a site of Muslim interest site known as the Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary. This area is thought to be part of an ancient city wall in Jerusalem dating back to the 10th century BC, possibly built by King Solomon. The inscription is eight letters long and was engraved on a large clay pitcher in the second half of the 10th century BC in Biblical times, which was used to store cheap wine. It was found in the Ophel area of the city, south of Temple Mount, as part of a dig by the Archaeological Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Some experts previously claimed it was written in an ancient near Eastern language, but Gershon Galil from the department of Jewish History at Haifa University believes it is actually a form of ancient Hebrew. A word on the pitcher reads ‘yayin’ or wine and he believes the whole inscription should read ‘in the year [… ]M, wine, part, m[…]’. Professor Galil explained the first missing word ends with ‘mem,’ which is the final part of the word for the 20th or 30th year of the kingdom and effectively dates the wine. The middle portion or ‘wine, part’ indicates the type of wine contained in the jar and in the Ugarit . language from northern Syria, a similar word to 'yayin' means the lowest quality of wine. The . final letter has been cut off from a longer word, but Professor . Gahil thinks it could indicate where the wine came from. The discovery was made in the ruins of a Byzantine public structure located  in the Ophel region between the city of David and the southern wall of the First Temple, (pictured). This area is thought to be part of an ancient city wall of Jerusalem dating back to the 10th century BC, possibly built by King Solomon . Professor Galil told The Archaeology News Network: ‘This wine wasn’t served to Solomon’s emissaries, or in the temple, but apparently was for the slave construction workers who worked in the area.’ Archaeologists already know that poor quality wine was drunk by soldiers and slave builders and believe that it was stored in large vessels that did not keep it particularly fresh, like the one found in the dig six months ago. Professor Galil thinks the carving was produced after King Solomon had built the first temple, his palaces and city walls. The earthenware jar that is now known to contain cheap wine, was found in the Ophel archaeological area in Jerusalem, where other treasures, including a number of Byzantine coins have been discovered . The find sheds light on the Biblical kingdom’s sophisticated society, where many people were thought to be literate, taxes were collected and builders recruited and bought to Jerusalem to build palaces and other infrastructure, according to the study, which was published in the journal New Studies on Jerusalem. Some historians dispute information gleaned from the Bible that Jerusalem was an important city, but supporters of the Biblical accounts, including Professor Galil, believe the inscription supports stories that tell of complicated administrative systems and a strictly hierarchical society. ‘Scribes that could write administrative texts could also write literary and historiographic texts and this has very important implications for the study of the Bible and understanding the history of Israel in the biblical period,’ he added. Dr Jonathan Stokl, a lecturer in Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament, from King’s College London told MailOnline: ‘The inscription is written in what is variously called “proto-Canaanite” or “late Canaanite” script. A 10cm medallion etched with a Menorah, Shofar made from a ram's horn and a Torah scroll, (pictured) was found at the same site as the earthenware jug inscribed with the wine label. However, the medallion dates from the 7th Century, unlike the older wine container . The language is probably an early form of Hebrew, but it could be a closely related dialect spoken in Jerusalem in the 10th century.’ He explained that at the time the inscription was made, the way words were written had not been agreed upon so some people wrote from left to right (like English) while others wrote in the opposite direction, like with modern Hebrew and Arabic. While Professor Galil has interpreted the inscription from right to left, another academic, Professor Christopher Rollinston has read it in the opposite way, but has not arrived upon a clear meaning. ‘Irrespective of what the reading of the inscription is, it attests to someone writing Hebrew (or a closely related language) in the 10th century in Jerusalem, probably for administrative reasons,’ he said. ‘Professor Galil suggests that this indicates that the inscription was made by some royal administration (something like an early civil service) and I believe that he is probably correct with that.'","The label dates from second half of the 10th Century BC and was discovered in the Ophel area of Jerusalem, south of Temple Mount .

An avalanche dumped 30 feet of snow on an Alaska highway and is blocking the only road leading into the port city of Valdez. The avalanche started on Friday and more occurred on Saturday. The Richardson Highway leading into the city will remain closed for about a week, reports CNN. Avalanches have dumped 30 feet of snow and ice on an Alaska highway, closing the only road into the port city of Valdez . This graphic distributed by the National Weather Service via social media diagrams the snow dam on the Lowe River in Keystone Canyon caused by Friday's avalanches . The Anchorage Daily News reported that the avalanche slides measured between 30 and 40 feet deep, according to Jeremy Woodrow, a state Department Transportation spokesman. Three inches of rain fell in the area Friday, a record for that day in January, said Mike Ottenweller, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Anchorage. The rain may have caused the series of avalanches to occur. Snow crews spent all of Saturday dropping aerial explosives in order to avoid additional slides. However, a new avalanche slid down the north side of Keystone Canyon on Saturday, perhaps caused by the preventative blasting activities. It measured between 1,000 and 1,500 feet long and between 60 and 70 feet deep, said Woodrow. The residents of the coastal town of about 4,000 are being urged to evacuate their homes because water is starting to accumulate behind the snow and debris left over by the massive avalanche. NBC News reports that the water accumulation can lead to the possibility of 'very dangerous' flash floods. 'Flash flooding is a very dangerous situation, ' the National Weather Service warned in an advisory. CNN reports that a shelter was was made in a high school and teen center for people who choose to evacuate their homes. The town website reports that Valdez has enough fuel and food for the time being but in the case of emergency, food and fuel can be brought to the town by barge. Valdez is a 300-mile drive from Anchorage, a large city in Alaska. According to CBC News, an avalanche can be caused by anything that disturbs accumulated snow on the side of a mountain. Natural factors could be precipitation (rain or additional snow), wind, rocks falling, sudden warm weather, or external factors like skiers or snowmobiles. Valdez is a 300-mile drive from Anchorage, the capital of Alaska.","The avalanche started on Friday and more occurred on Saturday .

An analysis of a rock sample collected by the rover found key chemical ingredients. 'We have found a habitable environment that is so benign and supportive of life, that probably if this water was around and you had been there, you would have been able to drink it,' said John Grotzinger, Curiosity's project scientist. Scroll down for video . This powered rock that shows there may once have been life on Mars: Analysis of a rock sample collected by the curiosity rover found key chemical ingredients for life, Nasa said today . Curiosity made the assessment after . studying a powdered sample drilled from a fine-grained rock at its . exploration site in Gale Crater, a deep impact bowl on Mars' equator. The rock was analysed in two of the rovers onboard chemistry labs:  Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) and . Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instruments. 'A fundamental question for this mission . is whether Mars could have supported a habitable environment,' said . Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program at the . agency's headquarters in Washington. 'From what we know now, the answer . is yes.' The groundbreaking analysis by the chemical lab onboard the Curiosity rover shows ancient Mars could have supported living microbes. Scientists identified sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon - some of the key chemical ingredients for life - in the powder Curiosity drilled out of a sedimentary rock near an ancient stream bed in Gale Crater on the Red Planet last month. Clues to this habitable environment come from data returned by the rover's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) and Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instruments. The data indicated the Yellowknife Bay area the rover is exploring was the end of an ancient river system or an intermittently wet lake bed that could have provided chemical energy and other favorable conditions for microbes. The rock is made up of a fine-grained mudstone containing clay minerals, sulfate minerals and other chemicals. This ancient wet environment, unlike some others on Mars, was not harshly oxidizing, acidic or extremely salty. The patch of bedrock where Curiosity drilled for its first sample lies in an ancient network of stream channels descending from the rim of Gale Crater. The bedrock also is fine-grained mudstone and shows evidence of multiple periods of wet conditions, including nodules and veins. a self-portrait of Curiosity at the drilling site where the discovery was made . This set of images shows the different types of rocks seen by NASA's Opportunity rover and Curiosity rover at two different parts of Mars. On the left is 'Wopmay' rock, in Endurance Crater, Meridiani Planum, as studied by the Opportunity rover. On the right are the rocks of the 'Sheepbed' unit in Yellowknife Bay, in Gale Crater, as seen by Curiosity. Curiosity's drill collected the sample at a site just a few hundred yards away from where the rover earlier found an ancient streambed in September 2012. 'Clay minerals make up at least 20 percent of the composition of this sample,' said David Blake, principal investigator for the CheMin instrument at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. These clay minerals are a product of the reaction of relatively fresh water with igneous minerals, such as olivine, also present in the sediment, Nasa said. The reaction could have taken place within the sedimentary deposit, during transport of the sediment, or in the source region of the sediment. The presence of calcium sulfate along with the clay suggests the soil is neutral or mildly alkaline. Scientists were surprised to find a mixture of oxidized, less-oxidized, and even non-oxidized chemicals, providing an energy gradient of the sort many microbes on Earth exploit to live. This partial oxidation was first hinted at when the drill cuttings were revealed to be gray rather than red. This side-by-side comparison shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of two different samples collected from the Martian surface by NASA's Curiosity rover. The Rocknest reading (left) suggests a dry, aeolian (wind-shaped) environment with low water activity. The John Klein pattern (right) suggests a lacustrine (lakebed) environment with high water activity. This full-resolution image from NASA's Curiosity shows the turret of tools at the end of the rover's extended robotic arm on Aug. 20, 2012 . 'The range of chemical ingredients we have identified in the sample is impressive, and it suggests pairings such as sulfates and sulfides that indicate a possible chemical energy source for micro-organisms,' said Paul Mahaffy, principal investigator of the SAM suite of instruments at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. An additional drilled sample will be used to help confirm these results for several of the trace gases analyzed by the SAM instrument. 'We have characterized a very ancient, but strangely new 'gray Mars' where conditions once were favorable for life,' said John Grotzinger, Mars Science Laboratory project scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif. This false-color map shows the area within Gale Crater on Mars, where NASA's Curiosity rover landed on Aug. 5, and the location where Curiosity collected its first drilled sample at the 'John Klein' rock . 'Curiosity is on a mission of discovery and exploration, and as a team we feel there are many more exciting discoveries ahead of us in the months and years to come.' Scientists now plan to work with Curiosity in the 'Yellowknife Bay' area for many more weeks before beginning a long drive to Gale Crater's central mound, Mount Sharp. Investigating the stack of layers exposed on Mount Sharp, where clay minerals and sulfate minerals have been identified from orbit, may add information about the duration and diversity of habitable conditions.","Groundbreaking analysis by the chemical lab onboard the Curiosity rover shows ancient Mars could have supported living microbes .

Britain will work with the new regime in Egypt while not supporting military intervention, William Hague said yesterday. The Foreign Secretary said the overthrow of Mohamed Morsi was a ‘dangerous thing’ that risks setting a precedent in the volatile region. But he said the UK will be forced to work with the army-backed government to protect Britons and British firms in the country. Foreign Secretary William Hague has said Britain will be forced to work with the new regime in Egypt while not supporting military intervention . The Egyptian Army line up across the road near the Presidential Palace, one day after the ousting of President Mohamed Morsi . Yesterday it emerged that four officers from the UK military’s Joint Force Headquarters will fly to Egypt with Foreign Office officials in what Mr Hague called a ‘rapid reaction team’ to assist and give guidance to British nationals. The officers will plan a contingency operation for the potential evacuation of Red Sea holiday resorts including Sharm El Sheikh, if required. The Foreign Secretary told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that Britain wanted to see the return of a civilian-led government in Egypt as soon as possible. ‘We don’t support military intervention as a way to resolve disputes in a democratic system,’ he said. Egyptians celebrate in front of the constitutional court after Egypt's chief justice Adli Mansour was sworn in as the nation's interim president . Thousands of the democratically elected president's supporters gather at Raba Al Adaawyia mosque . ‘It’s of course a dangerous precedent to do that, if one president can be deposed by the military then of course another one can be in the future – that’s a dangerous thing. ‘It’s happened, so we have to recognise the situation will move on.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the Government did not support coups and wanted Egypt to a return to democratic rule as soon as possible . He added: ‘We recognise states not governments. We recognise the state of Egypt and we have to work with whoever is in authority in Egypt, we have to do that for the safety of British nationals. ‘We have to do that because there are so many British companies there. There isn’t really any question of not recognising a particular government.’ Speaking during his weekly phone-in on LBC radio, Nick Clegg said the Government did not support coups and wanted Egypt to a return to democratic rule as soon as possible. ‘I hope we will look back on this as a very, very painful phase of change for a country not accustomed to democracy and democratic transfer of power,’ said the Deputy Prime Minister. David Cameron’s official spokesman refused to refer to the revolt as a coup – calling it instead a ‘military intervention’. In America, Barack Obama has also avoided the word coup. This is probably because, under US law, Washington cannot give aid to a country where one has taken place. In a carefully worded statement on Wednesday, the president said he was ‘deeply concerned’ by the military’s move to topple the Egyptian government and suspend its constitution. He said he had ordered his officials to assess what the military’s actions meant for US foreign aid to Egypt. The US provides around £1billion a year in military and economic assistance and is considered a critical US security priority.","William Hague said UK will work with army-backed government .

Furious Tory MPs last night rounded on European Commissioner Viviane Reding who accused David Cameron of deliberately spreading ‘populist myths’ about immigration and benefits tourism. Mrs Reding accused the PM of raising the issue deliberately to distract from the ‘real subjects’ of concern to British people. She said Mr Cameron’s actions were ‘destroying the future’ of Britain. Her comments were condemned as ‘unbelievable’ and ‘utter nonsense’ by Tory backbenchers, who accused her of being out of touch. Criticised: European Commissioner Viviane Reding, pictured, said David Cameron was spreading 'populist myths' about immigration and benefit tourism deliberately to distract from real subjects of concern to Britain . James Clappison, MP for Hertsmere, praised Mr Cameron for his approach and said Mrs Reding’s remarks were ‘wholly inappropriate’. ‘She has no business in commenting in those terms and no business in interfering with national immigration policies,’ he said. MP James Clappison said: 'She has no business commenting... and interfering with immigration policies' South Northamptonshire MP Andrea Leadsom, writing on the Spectator website, said the comments showed out ‘completely out of touch with voters’ Mrs Reding was. ‘Whilst I believe the UK will remain an open economy and society that welcomes hard-working and aspiring people from across Europe, to hide our heads in the sand and pretend that the free movement of people across the EU does not come with some negative consequences is utter nonsense. ‘The issue of immigration is one of the biggest concerns of taxpayers across many EU countries, and the impact on wages, access to benefits, and ‘social dislocation’ all need to be addressed in the context of large scale migration in the EU. She added: ‘Member states must be able to decide who should be allowed to access their welfare.’ Mrs Reding made her comments an online discussion. She claimed that ‘most of the things which are told to the people in Great Britain are myths, have nothing to do with reality.’ ‘Coming back to the subject which the Government of the UK has pushed to the agenda, probably in order not to make people speak about the real subjects in the UK, are this supposed invasion of foreigners coming to the UK and stealing the jobs and stealing the social security and the health money. ‘The free movement and supposed invasion by the people who want to take advantage of the social security and health is an invention of politicians who like to have populist movements in order to win in elections. The European Commissioner said: 'I'm frustrated about [British] political leaders. What is leadership if you just try with political movements and political speeches to gain votes? You are destroying the future of your people' ‘I’m mostly frustrated about the political leaders (of the UK). What is leadership if you just try with political movements and political speeches to gain votes? You are destroying the future of your people, actually.’ Mr Cameron has enraged the commission with his proposals to stop migrants from EU states claiming child benefit for children living in their home country. Tory MEP Daniel Hannan said instead of 'populism' the Eurocrat should have used the word 'democracy' The Government has also floated broader proposals to rein in EU free movement rules, a sacred cow for Eurocrats. Earlier this week Mrs Reding, who is vice-president of the EC, called for the EU to become a ‘United States of Europe’ with the Commission as its government. Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said: ‘When Mrs Reding says ‘populism’, what she means is ‘politicians doing what their constituents want’, or as we call it in English, ‘democracy’. ‘The EU’s problem is not its people, but the unelected paleo-federalists like Mrs Reding with their 1950s visions of a European superstate.’ Tory backbencher Mark Reckless said he was ‘very surprised’ by the comments. The MP for Rochester and Strood told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme it was the EU which was ‘stoking up’ the row and that the Government’s approach had been ‘quite moderate’. ‘People in this country get social security benefit, but they spend it here, but very often people coming from Poland - and perhaps now from Romania and Bulgaria - are sending money home. I think it’s quite wrong that if a child is being schooled in Poland and with family there that they should be paid child benefit by the taxpayers of this country.’ He said the PM should be ‘much more assertive’ in its dealings with the EU. A government spokesman said: ‘Hardworking people expect and deserve a benefits system that is fair to British citizens and migrants who come here to work but is robust and tough on those who abuse the system and flout the law.’","Viviane Reding said PM was deliberately spreading myths to win elections .

National Weather Service Meteorologist Scott Blair stopped short of calling the latest round of cold part of the polar vortex, which are winds that circulate around the North Pole. 'There's really nothing abnormal about the air that's coming into the area,' he said. 'It's just been a very persistent pattern of cold air'. He said it's an amplified pattern of the jet stream, and cold air is filtering in behind a large trough of low pressure. Mr Blair added: 'Troughs are typically associated with unstable or unsettled weather, and, at this time of the year, much colder air.' In the Chicago area, residents were bracing for a historic deep freeze. By sunrise on Monday, weather forecasters in Chicago were telling viewers that the high temperature for the day had already come and gone and that the low may reach minus 4 degrees with wind chills at 40 below . Such temperatures are expected to hold into Tuesday. If Chicago makes it to 60 hours below zero, it will be the longest stretch since 1983, when it was below zero for 98 hours, and the third longest in 80 years. The persistent weather pattern was driving bitterly cold air south from the Arctic sending temperatures plunging across the U.S. The blasts of Arctic air have been relentless so far this month for many cities east of the Rockies. Unfortunately, for many areas January will end before any significant relief can arrive .

Ice surrounds the boat docks in the harbor at 31st Street Beach as Chicago braced for another round of severe cold as temperatures are expected to drop to -15 to -20 degrees this evening and wind chills are anticipated as low as -25 to -45 degrees through Wednesday . More than 500 flights have already been canceled at O'Hare International Airport and more than 90 at Midway today. Chicago resident Matt Ryan, 19, was headed to his family's house in the suburb of Oak Park on Sunday. 'I came home to steal a scarf from my parents,' he said. His plan for Monday: Dress in layers, carry hand warmers and wear long underwear. Ryan said he was a little excited that classes were going to be canceled at the University of Illinois at Chicago, but that he'd never seen a winter so intense. 'I'm sick of it,' he said.

There was no easing up in the brutal winter weather towards the end January for much of the East Coast and Midwest . More than 500 flights had been canceled from Chicago airports as more Arctic blasts pummeled the East Coast and Midwest on Monday . Chicago Public Schools called off Monday's classes for its nearly 400,000 students a day in advance, as did suburban districts. Earlier this month, when it was below zero for 36 straight hours, CPS closed for two days. North . Dakota and South Dakota residents dealt with dangerous cold on Sunday . and wind gusts that reached up to 60 mph. The high winds led to blowing . snow that made it nearly impossible to travel in some parts. 'This . is definitely the most widespread event we've had this year,' said . weather service meteorologist Adam Jones in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Snow . and high winds in Indiana led officials there to restrict vehicle . traffic or recommend only essential travel in more than half of the . state's counties. And Iowa officials said the combination of snow and high winds would make traveling dangerous; forecasters there called for wind chills to be as low as 40 below zero on Monday. The Arctic blast was expected to maintain its grip later into the week across much of the East Coast and stretching into the South . In Michigan, snow on the roads and deep subfreezing temperatures contributed to multiple crashes Sunday that forced expressway closings. And on Saturday night, two people were killed in Grand Haven Township in western Michigan because of similar weather conditions, authorities said. Alex Alfidi, manager at Leo's Coney Island restaurant in the Detroit suburb of Birmingham, said the extreme winter weather is hurting his business. 'We slowed down big time,' Alfidi, 39, said, noting that while he's been getting some carryout business, the casual walk-in customers have been staying away. He also said it's hard for him and his employees to get to and from work in the snow, ice and cold. Sometimes, the 24-hour restaurant is operating with just him and a waitress. Alfidi said he has seen some challenging winters in 15 years in Michigan, but none as bad as the current winter. 'This is the biggest one,' he said.

But with no room for a boat - the two . acquired a Red Bull winch pulley system from their friend Nick Mangos, 27, which can pull in boarders at break-neck speeds. Scroll down for video . Daredevil: Jorge Gill, 18, from  London, speeds through Bedford Road Car Park on a wakeboard thanks to a winch pulley system . Jack Hammersley, 24, then takes his turn on the winch - narrowly avoiding an array of concrete pillars dotted throughout the space . The boarders were pulled in over the 2ft-deep water in the Surrey carpark using a winch pulley system (pictured centre) The two waited until yesterday night to set up the system - away from the glare of passers-by. Once it was all set to go, they then weaved around several precarious pillars, taking amazing footage as they went. And, when the thrill of dodging through the carpark wasn't enough, the boys moved on to nearby Shalford Park to pull out some jumps and tricks. The system works by pulling the users in at speeds of over 15mph. The boarders walk out as far as they can with the wire before being winched in by the machine. When either the water runs out or they fall, the boarder lets go and the winch continues without them. The water in the carpark was up to 2ft deep, but only 1ft deep in the park. The two boarders then moved on to Shalford Park in Guildford to try their hands at some jumps and tricks (pictured) This picture shows the winch in use - pulling in the boarders at speeds of over 15mph. Despite his experience Mr Hammersley (pictured) had a nasty fall shortly after this shot . Jorge Gill is a professional wakeboarder and Jack Hammersley a professional wakeboard coach. But despite their experience, Mr Hammersley managed to have a painful fall at the hands of the pulley. Nick Mangos, 27, who was operating the winch, said: 'Jack came out of the water at one point and fell face first onto the bank at Shalford Park. 'He was alright though, but it was pretty bad. We have all been friends for years and, with the recent rain, the others had scouted out these two spots as good places to go. 'As we weren't really suppose to be there, we waited until after dark when all the shoppers had gone. I then brought the winch and set it up and the others had a great time. 'I think they were a bit worried as they had concrete around them and not far below them. But that's all part of the fun. Using the winch isn't really done much - so I think others should be encouraged to try it out.'","Jorge Gill, 18, from London and Jack .

Charles Duke's family on the moon's surface after he placed it there during the Apollo 16 mission . It's a little known fact but a family has been on the moon for more than 40 years. Apollo 16 astronaut Charles Duke didn't just leave footprints when he visited the lunar surface, he left a photograph of his family. On 23 April 1972,  astronauts Charlie Duke and John Young embarked on a mission to explore the moon's Descartes Highlands in a Lunar Roving . Vehicle. Before setting up a Solar Wind Collector, Lunar Module pilot Duke left a photograph of himself with his wife and their two sons, Thomas and Charles, sitting on a bench. It remains there til this day. The reverse of the photo is signed by . Duke's family and bears the message: 'This is the family of Astronaut . Duke from Planet Earth. Landed on the Moon, April 1972.' Duke photographed the family picture with a Hasselblad camera as it rested on the dusty surface next to one of his boot prints. The image was unearthed in the Project Apollo Image Archive, which serves as an online reference source and repository of digital images pertaining to the historic manned lunar landing programme. He also left a commemorative medal issued by the United States Air Force, which was celebrating its 25th anniversary in 1972. Apollo 16 was the tenth manned mission in the United States Apollo space programme, the fifth to land on the Moon and the first to land in the lunar highlands. It was crewed by Commander John Young, Lunar Module Pilot Charles Duke and Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly. Lunar Module Pilot Charles Duke (left and right), at 36, became the youngest ever astronaut to walk the moon . Astronaut Charles Duke and family view interior of Apollo 16 spacecraft which was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on April 16, 1972 .

At the age of 36, Duke became the tenth and youngest human to walk on the Moon. Apollo 15 commander Dave Scott joins the Duke family in observing extra vehicular activities (EVA) at Kennedy Space Center . After setting foot on the lunar . surface, Duke exclaimed: 'Fantastic!

The United States men's ice hockey team went to Sochi with huge expectations but instead failed to earn a medal in a shocking blowout loss that closed their Olympic run. Finland rode wiley veteran Teemu Selanne, 43, and goalkeeper Tuukka Rask to a crushing 5-0 defeat over an uninspired American squad highlighted by Patrick Kane missing two penalty shots, one off the crossbar. Teemu Selanne scored two goals and Tuukka Rask had a 27-save shutout, helping Finland rout the United States 5-0 to win hockey bronze at the Sochi Games. Utter disappointment: USA forward Joe Pavelski (8), left and USA goalie Jonathan Quick (32) greet each other following their loss Saturday to Finland in the men's Bronze Medal hockey game . After beating opponents by a combined 17-4 through their first four Olympic contests, including a defeat of host country Russia, Team USA's powerful offense was held scoreless against both Canada and Finlad to close out the Sochi games. A scoreless first gave way to Finnish bedlam in the second and third periods. There would be no overtime to decide the Bronze Medal. Selanne and Jussi Jokinen scored 11 . seconds apart early in pivotal second period. The Finns had three goals . in the third against a team that looked like it would rather be at home. Finnish forward Mikael Granlund said he's thrilled that Selanne, his idol, capped his Olympic career with a victory. 'He's 43 years old and can still play at this level,' said the 21-year-old Granlund. 'You can't understand how important he is for Finland.' Finland has won four medals in the last five Olympics, more than any other nation in the NHL era. Before the match became a rout in the final period, it was a game of missed opportunities for the Americans. Patrick Kane couldn't convert on a penalty shot in each of the first two periods. He missed the net to the right on his first one-on-one duel and hit the right crossbar on his second. Jubilation: Team Finland pose for a photo with their Bronze medals after their blowout win . Rolling: Finland's Juuso Hietanen celebrates with teammates after scoring his team's third goal against Quick . 'The first one kind of rolled on me I thought I had him,' he said. 'The second one I made a good shot and it just hit the post. I had some chances today, I just didn't really capitalize on anything.' Kane, who also missed a breakaway in overtime against Russia, said Saturday's setback was one of the most frustrating games of his career. 'Whether it was confidence or not getting enough chances, who really knows at the end of the day,' he said. 'I thought I had opportunities. Obviously, it would have been nice burying that breakaway against Russia and (then) you get two penalty shots. 'You think you're in three times against the goaltender alone and hopefully you could score a couple of times out of that. It just wasn't meant to be.' No, it wasn't. Almost over: (L-R) Finland's Sami Lepisto, Jarkko Immonen, Teemu Selanne and Lauri Korpikoski react after a goal during the third period . The Americans wasted a chance to earn medals in consecutive Olympic hockey tournaments for the first time since winning gold in 1960 and silver in 1956. Finland, meanwhile, took advantage of two power plays in the third period with goals to put the U.S. away in game it didn't look interested in competing in after falling behind 2-0. If the league and players' union do not let the world's best players go to South Korea in four years, Kane and Co. may never get a shot to help the Americans win gold that has been elusive since the 1980 'Miracle on Ice.' Jonathan Quick, starting ahead of silver-medal winning goaltender Ryan Miller, stopped all eight shots that got to him in the first before giving up five goals on just 21 shots over the last two periods. Selanne, who has said he will retire after playing for the Anaheim Ducks this season, skated off the ice in Sochi for the final time with 20 seconds to play and hugged two teammates on the bench before leaping back over the boards at the final buzzer. Man of the match: Finland's Teemu Selanne celebrates after scoring his team's fourth goal - he tallied two on the day . While someone behind the Finns' bench threw a slew of white sheets paper high into the air, the team gathered around Rask's net for a jubilant celebration. From the ice, Selanne reached over the boards to embrace every assistant coach and executive on Finland's bench. The popular player got lifted off his skates more than once by hugs. The predominantly Russian crowd roared in support of the Finns. With bronze medals around their necks, Selanne led his team on a victory lap as the players threw bouquets of flowers to fans before posing for a picture at center ice. The U.S. seemed set up to end its Olympic hockey championship drought, or at least come home with a medal, with a group of talented players in their prime. They did it: Finland goaltender Tuukka Rask and Kimmo Timonen celebrate after their 5-0 win over USA . It started well, routing Slovakia, outlasting the host Russians in an eight-round shootout and cruising past Slovenia and the Czech Republic by a combined score of 20-6. The Americans were humbled by defending champion Canada, which also beat them in the gold-medal game in 2010, with a 1-0 win that was more lopsided than the score indicated. Then, they got embarrassed by Finland. The U.S. had an inspired start, blocking shots with various parts of their bodies, including Phil Kessel's chest when he stood tall in an open net. Selanne seemed to deflate the American' spirit with his backhander from the left circle that beat Quick's blocker for the first goal. Before the U.S. could catch its breath, the Finns took a 2-0 lead 1:38 into the second period when Jokinen caught Quick out of place after a cross-ice pass by shooting into an open net from the right side. Sage veteran: Teemu Selanne leads Team Finland around the ice after receiving their Bronze Medals . Finland won bronze for the second straight Olympics and third time since 1998, the first with NHL players. It lost to rival Sweden in the 2006 gold-medal game and in Friday's semifinals. The Finns were fired up for the consolation prize and weren't satisfied with a two-goal lead after two periods, pouring it on with Juuso Hietanen's goal 6:10 into the third - as a penalty on Kane was expiring - and Selanne scored for a second time less than two minutes later. Selanne, the oldest player in the tournament, started the game with an Olympic record 41 points and extended his mark with a fantastic game. Olli Maatta put Finland ahead 5-0 with 6:51 left in the game and U.S. coach Dan Bylsma left Quick in the game, leaving Miller staring expressionless across the ice from the bench.","Team USA failed to score in either of its final two matches after outscoring opponents 17-4 during the 2014 Olympic games .

The unusual mass ceremony, scheduled for March 18, will honor veterans, most of Hispanic or Jewish heritage, who had already been recognized with the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second-highest military award. Only three of the recipients are living. 'I never really did worry about decorations,' said one of those being honored, Melvin Morris of Cocoa, Fla., who was commended for courageous actions while a staff sergeant during combat operations on Sept. 17, 1969, in the vicinity of Chi Lang, South Vietnam. (From left) Spec. 4 Santiago J. Erevia, Sgt. 1st Class Jose Rodela and Staff Sgt. Melvin Morris. President Barack Obama will award the Medal of Honor on March 18, 2014, to 24 Army veterans, including Erevia, Rodela and Morris, who are still alive and fought in the Vietnam War, following a congressionally mandated review to ensure that eligible recipients were not bypassed due to prejudice . Morris, who is black, said in an interview that it never occurred to him that his race might have prevented him from receiving the Medal of Honor. He said it was a huge surprise when the Army contacted him last May about the review and then arranged for a call from Obama. 'I fell to my knees. I was shocked,' Morris said. 'President Obama said he was sorry this didn't happen before. He said this should have been done 44 years ago.' The other living recipients are Spc. 4 Santiago J. Erevia of San Antonio, cited for courage during a search and clear mission near Tam Ky, South Vietnam, on May 21, 1969; and Sgt. 1st Class Jose Rodela of San Antonio, cited for courage during combat operations in Phuoc Long province, South Vietnam, on Sept. 1, 1969. The Army conducted the review under a directive from Congress in the 2002 National Defense Authorization Act. The law required that the record of each Jewish American and Hispanic American veteran who received a Service Cross during or after World War II be reviewed for possible upgrade to the Medal of Honor. The Pentagon said the Army reviewed the cases of the 6,505 recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross from World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars and found an eligible pool of 600 soldiers who may have been Jewish or Hispanic. The Army also worked with the National Museum of American Jewish Military History, the Jewish War Veterans of the USA and the American GI Forum, the largest Hispanic-American veterans group, to pinpoint potential medal recipients. On March 18th, 2014, President Barack Obama will award 24 Army veterans the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry . These veterans will receive the Medal of Honor in recognition of their valor during major combat operations in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War .

A fraternity chapter was indefinitely suspended and three of its members were kicked out over claims that they put a noose on a statue of the University of Mississippi's first black student. The fraternity said it may hand over the identities of the students suspected of defacing the statue of James Meredith, who was the first black student to enroll at the then all-white college. In a statement, Sigma Phi Epsilon said it suspended the Alpha Chapter at the university and the chapter voted to expel all three men. Outrage: University of Mississippi students protest at the noose incident next to the James Meredith statue . Police on Sunday found a noose tied around the neck of the statue, along with an old Georgia flag with a Confederate battle emblem in its design. When Meredith tried to enter Ole Miss in 1962, Mississippi's governor tried to stop him, which led to violence on the Oxford campus. U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy sent 500 U.S. marshals to take control and days later Meredith was allowed in the school. Though he faced harassment, he graduated with a degree in political science. The FBI said Friday it planned to expand the vandalism investigation for potential violations of federal law. 'It is embarrassing that these men had previously identified with our fraternity,' Brian C. Warren Jr, chief executive of Sigma Phi Epsilon, said. 'SigEp as a national fraternity has championed racial equality and issues on diversity since 1959 when it became the first national fraternity to invite members of all races, creeds and religions to join its membership.' Defaced: A fraternity has suspended three of its members who are suspected of putting a noose around the statue's neck . Warren said the fraternity will conduct a review to ensure that members' values align with those espoused by the organization. 'We won't allow the actions of a few men to undermine the more than five decades of leadership this fraternity has demonstrated in the fight for racial equality and diversity on our college campuses,' he said. The university tried to question three white students in connection with the vandalism on Friday but their attorneys would not allow that to happen without arrest warrants. The men have not been identified. University spokesman Danny Blanton said the school's findings have been turned over to the district attorney's office. Blanton said the university will also proceed with internal disciplinary action through a judicial panel that consists of both faculty and students. The university is satisfied that the three students under investigation are responsible for the statue's desecration, Blanton said. The Ole Miss Alumni Association is offering at $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. University Police Department Chief Calvin Sellers said the reward offer gave police some good leads in the case. Blanton said it's not yet clear who might share in the reward. District Attorney Ben Creekmore did not immediately respond to a message left Friday by the Associated Press. However, he told WMC-TV in Memphis that criminal charges would be difficult. Investigation: The university offered a $25,000 reward for information about the incident . Creekmore said investigators and prosecutors have looked into several misdemeanors, but he said criminal charges were unlikely by his office because the statue was not physically damaged, and the suspects did not appear to be trespassing. He said federal investigators could opt to bring charges if they saw fit. Creekmore said if new information comes to light, his office could revisit the issue. Blanton said it was up to state and federal authorities to press criminal charges, but 'obviously, since we've seen who is responsible, we want to take swift and decisive action'. 'What we want to do is to show this type action can't take place on this campus. We want to demonstrate that we will not tolerate this type behavior,' he said. Ole Miss will move forward 'as soon as possible' with discipline through the university's student judicial process. That panel, which consists of faculty and students, could choose sanctions including dismissal and barring the three from campus, Blanton said. 'We certainly wish [those responsible] would be forthright and discuss this matter so that we can get to the bottom of it. We want to hear their side. We want to know not just what happened, but why they did it. We want to open a dialogue,' he said.","Sigma Phi Epsilon closes Alpha chapter on Ole Miss campus indefinitely .

Richard Branson has said his Virgin Galactic space flights cannot afford to lose anyone aboard when the crafts eventually blast off for the first time . Sir Richard Branson has said he cannot afford to lose anyone aboard his commercial space flight venture Virgin Galactic when the operation eventually blasts off for the first time. The entrepreneur said the flight - which aims to reach 62 miles above earth and include around five minutes of weightlessness - does pose safety risks to those aboard. He added NASA have lost three per cent of people they have put in to space - and that re-entry towards earth had posed the biggest problems for astronauts. However, Sir Richard said he still planned to take his children up on the first flight - which the multimillionaire hopes will take off in autumn. In an interview with Guardian Weekend Magazine, he said: 'Everybody who signs up knows this is the birth of a new space programme and understands the risks that go with that. 'The biggest worry I had was re-entry. NASA has lost about 3 per cent of everyone who's gone into space, and re-entry has been their biggest problem. 'For a government-owned company, you can just about get away with losing 3 per cent of your clients. For a private company you can't really lose anybody.' Virgin Galactic was founded in 2004, shortly after the creation of the first reusable spacecraft for private use - the SpaceShipOne - which was designed by retired aerospace engineer Burt Rutan. Along with funding from Paul Allen, a . Microsoft billionaire, the engineer won a $10m grant to create a reusable craft for . the first private space flight. SS1 was the first private spaceship to complete a series of high-altitude flights in 2004. Branson's Virgin Galatic SpaceShipTwo is a larger version of the SS1 - and can accommodate six people plus two pilots. Scroll down for video . The SpaceShipTwo craft is based on a design by aerospace engineer Burt Rutan who made the first successful reusable craft to go into space in 2004 . Hollywood stars Tom Hanks and Angelina Jolie are among about 700 people who have paid up to Â£155,000 to take part in a two-hour flight aboard Branson's SS2. Along with the flight, those aboard will experience about five minutes of weightlessness as part of the package. So far, three test flights of the SS2 have only managed altitude of around 71,000ft - approximately 13 miles. In order to receive the necessary Federal Aviation Administration licence, the craft needs to complete test missions at full speed and 62-mile height. Critics say the engine in Mr Branson's craft will need redesigning before it is capable of getting to the required altitude - making an autumn flight unlikely. Branson biographer Tom Bower told the newspaper: 'For the last 10 years he'd been trying to make it work and it just isn't working. Where's the evidence he can make it work in the next six months?'

So far, it has only managed to reach an altitude of 13 miles - well below Branson's aims for it to reach 62 miles above earth .","Sir Richard says his Virgin Galactic spacecraft poses safety challenges .

A pulsar moving at five million miles per hour has delivered the longest jet of high energy particles astronomers have ever seen. The jet trail stretches 37 light years, or 218 trillion miles long - ten times as long as the distance between our sun and its nearest star. Pulsars are rotating neutron stars formed when the core of a massive star undergoes gravitational collapse at the end of its life. Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory has seen a fast-moving pulsar escaping from a supernova remnant while spewing out a record-breaking jet - the longest of any object in the Milky Way (seen here in the bottom right) This pulsar, known as IGR J11014-6103, and its peculiar behaviour can likely be traced back to its birth in the collapse and subsequent explosion of a massive star. The pulsar is located about 60 light-years away from the centre of the supernova remnant SNR MSH 11-61A in the constellation of Carina. Spotted by Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory, its speed is between 2.5 million and 5 million mph, making it one of the fastest pulsars ever observed. ‘We've never seen an object that moves this fast and also produces a jet,’ said Lucia Pavan of the University of Geneva in Switzerland. The jet here is seen with X-rays from Chandra. This pulsar - a spinning neutron star - is moving between 2.5 million and 5 million miles per hour . When the core of a massive star undergoes gravitational collapse at the . end of its life, protons and electrons are scrunched together, . leaving behind a neutron star. Neutron stars can fit roughly 1.3 to 2.5 solar masses into a city-sized . sphere perhaps 12 miles across. Matter is packed so . tightly that a sugar-cube-sized amount of material would weigh more than . 1 billion tonnes. Most known neutron stars belong to a subclass known as pulsars. These relatively young objects rotate extremely rapidly, with some spinning faster than a kitchen blender. They beam radio waves in narrow cones, which periodically sweep across Earth. ‘By comparison, this jet is almost 10 times longer than the distance between the sun and our nearest star.’ As well as its impressive span, it has a distinct corkscrew pattern that suggests the pulsar is wobbling like a spinning top. The pulsar's jet and the pulsar wind nebula are nearly perpendicular to one another, which is baffling scientists. ‘We can see this pulsar is moving directly away from the centre of the supernova remnant based on the shape and direction of the pulsar wind nebula,’ said co-author Pol Bordas, from the University of Tuebingen in Germany. ‘The question is, why is the jet pointing off in this other direction?’ Usually, the spin axis and jets of a pulsar point in the same direction as they are moving, but IGR J11014-6103's spin axis and direction of motion are almost at right angles. ‘With the pulsar moving one way and the jet going another, this gives us clues that exotic physics can occur when some stars collapse,’ said co-author Gerd Puehlhofer also of the University of Tuebingen. One possibility requires an extremely fast rotation speed for the iron core of the star that exploded. A problem with this scenario is that such fast speeds are not commonly expected to be achievable. The supernova remnant that gave birth to IGR J11014-6013 is elongated from top-right to bottom-left in the image roughly in line with the jet's direction. The strange movements and huge jet could be explained if its parent star's iron core had an extremely fast rotation speed. However, Nasa said that such fast speeds were not commonly thought to be achievable .","The pulsar - a spinning neutron star - is located in constellation of Carina .

For most cost-conscious consumers, keeping a car running for as long as possible is a serious financial issue. Automotive web site iSeeCars.com - which aggregates used car listings - have put together a study on cars with the best longevity, based on the amount that had been listed online with 200,000 or more miles on the odometer. Topping the list was the Ford F-250 Super Duty with 4.2 percent, CBS News reported. That represents about 4,000 pickups out of some 95,000 of that model for sale, according to Phong Ly, co-founder and CEO of iSeeCars. To measure longevity, automotive web site iSeeCars.com - which aggregates used car listings - analyzed data to see what specific vehicles for sale had the highest percentage of listings with 200,000 or more miles on the odometer . Results: The list of cars is based on the amount that are listed as for sale with over 200,000 miles . Topping the list was the Ford F-250 Super Duty with 4.2 percent. That represents about 4,000 pickups out of some 95,000 of that model for sale . Interestingly, the top 10 rankings are all large pickups and SUVs, with the Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD taking second place. 'Clearly some of these vehicles are used for work and they are driven more miles but also perhaps get better maintenance,' Ly told CBS MoneyWatch. Pickups are driven longer, with the average listing for all models showing 90,000 miles compared to 75,000 for the average car listing. Among cars, Honda Accord was at the top, with 1.6 percent of listings showing over 200,000 miles. But that percentage is relatively low, partly because there are so many Accords on the market. Of the 377,000 Accords for sale, about 6,000 have over 200,000 miles. Others among the top ten (when trucks and SUVS were excluded) included, in order - Subaru Legacy, Toyota Avalon, Honda Odyssey minivan, Nissan Maxima, Toyota Camry, Ford Taurus, Honda Civic, Acura TL and Subaru Outback. The Honda Accord was the number one car, the study found . While the top vehicles were SUVs and trucks, the Subaru Legacy also rated highly as a car . While Ford and Chevrolet topped the list of long-running trucks, the Ford Taurus is the only model on the car list from a Detroit-based brand. Increases in manufacturing quality in the last decade have contributed to more vehicles lasting for 200,000 miles or more. 'Car makers are making better vehicles, and that is a factor in the increasing longevity,' said Phong Ly. That has resulted in a market even for well-used vehicles. For instance, a 2003 Ford F-150 with 228,000 miles has an asking price of $4,900. Family size: The Honda Odyssey has a good performance record . A 2001 Honda Accord sporting 250,000 miles is on sale for $3,000. Those prices are 10 to 15 percent of list price for a well-equipped new 2014 version of the same model. Experts say the easiest way to ensure your car runs as long as possible is to follow the prescribed maintenance schedule and use a good mechanic. Ensuring that you got some highway driving in is also healthy for the car, with short stop-and-go trips hard on a car.","Study done by automotive web site iSeeCars.com .
