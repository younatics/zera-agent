Saudi Arabian princess Meshael Alayban, 42, behind bars in Santa Ana, California July 11, 2013 . Alayban is married to Abdulrahman bin Nasser bin Abdulaziz al Saud, who is the grandson of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. In addition to the Kenyan woman, police said that when officers executed a search warrant for Alayban's home, they discovered four women from the Philippines also working in similar circumstances. All five of the women's passports had been confiscated and placed in a bank safe deposit box which they allegedly did not have access to. Farrah Emami, of the Orange County District Attorney's Office confirmed to MailOnline that Abdulaziz al Saud was in the United States when his wife was arrested. They added that Alayban was arrested due to their belief a criminal case could be pursued against her. Accused: Meshael Alayban, who was arrested in Irvine, California,  has been charged with one count of human trafficking for allegedly holding a domestic servant against her will . Meshael Alayban is married to Abdulrahman bin Nasser bin Abdulaziz al Saud (pictured), who is the grandson of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia . However, they added that the investigation into the four other women was ongoing 'to see if criminal charges are appropriate to any other individuals.' Emami said that she believes that al Saud is still in the United States. Meshael Alayban, 42, faces human trafficking charges and up to 12 years in prison after she allegedly held a 30-year-old Kenyan at her Orange County, California home after taking her passport from her. Alayban was arrested after the Kenyan woman carrying a suitcase flagged down a bus after escaping and tearfully told a passenger that she was a human trafficking victim. The passenger helped the lady contact police who traveled to Alayban's home where they found another four servants from the Philippines allegedly in similar conditions after serving a search warrant on the condo where the princess, her husband and her family lived. The 30-year-old woman was hired through an agency in Kenya in March 2012 and her passport was allegedly taken from her on arrival in Saudi Arabia by Alayban. Police say Alayban's family traveled to the United States in May with the victim and four women from the Philippines. Seriousness: Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas speaks at an informal news conference after a hearing at the Santa Ana Courthouse in Santa Ana, California today after Meshael Alayban was charged . It is thought that the Saudi Arabian consulate in Los Angeles may have posted the $5 million bail and Alayban has been ordered to wear a GPS tracking device as she is considered a flight risk. 'This is not a contract dispute,' Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told the court during a bail hearing on Wednesday afternoon. 'This is holding someone captive against their will.' Alayban's attorney, Paul Meyer, said the case was a contractual dispute and argued his client shouldn't be assigned a ransom-like bail solely because she was rich. He said she had been traveling to the United States since she was a child, owned properties here and had given her word she would address the allegations. 'This is a domestic work hours dispute,' he said. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, . (left), watches as Irvine Police Chief David Maggard speaks after a . hearing at the Santa Ana Courthouse in Santa Ana, California . Rackauckas had originally asked the judge to deny bail for Alayban or set it at $20 million, saying it was unlikely any amount would guarantee a Saudi princess would show up in court. The victim was working 'around the clock' for the family cooking, cleaning and caring for children, said Irvine police chief David Maggard Jr. She had been promised wages of $1,600 a month but was paid only about $220 a month, Rackauckas said. The victims alleges that instead of her contracted work eight hours a day, five days a week, she instead was putting in 16 hour shifts, seven days a week on every conceivable household chore. The Kenyan lady also said that she was working abroad to pay for her seven-year-old daughter's medical bills. Alayban allegedly only gave the passports to the five women at passport control and has had them under lock and key in a bank safe box since they arrived in the United States in May. Arrest: Police in Orange County arrested Meshael Alayban at this condo in Irvine - where she has been staying with her family since May of this year . Investigations into each of the victims' circumstances are ongoing. All five women are said to be in good health. No indications of physical abuse were found and were being assisted with finding housing at a shelter. The other four women left the home voluntarily with police once authorities arrived. They told police they were interested in being free, Maggard said. No charges have been filed yet in connection with their circumstances. Powerful: Senior members of the Saudi royal family walk around Mecca - Meshael Alayban is married to a member of the ruling al-Saud family in the Middle Eastern nation . Distressed: The unidentified 30-year-old Kenyan woman hailed down a bus in Orange County and explained to a passenger her alleged imprisonment . 'The laws of our nation and California do not tolerate people who . deprive or violate the liberty of another and obtain forced labor or . services,' District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said in the statement. 'If . any person is being enslaved, he or she should contact law enforcement.

"NBC has announced plans to introduce Matrix-style replays into its coverage of pro football. They will use freeD™ system by Replay Technologies that have been used in PGA golf shows. This comes after Japanese television network NHK announced last month that they will use a robotic rig to shoot footage in 360 degrees and slow motion. Scroll down for video . Saturday Night Football will use the 360 degree technology to capture the action in both end zones . The move will give fans a complete view of the events, reported Peta Pixel. Sunday Night Football, the most watched show on television, will use one 24-camera bullet time rig at each end zone. The technology will be installed by the first game in September between the Giants and Cowboys in Dallas. It will ensure that there is a back-up in case a referee makes a controversial or incorrect decision. NBC announced that they will use the technology from September . NBC’s Cris Collinsworth: ‘We're trying to be a show that really appeals to everybody. ‘We're trying to [show] human beings behind the facemasks.’ NHK last month said they would use a robotic multi-camera system that has been developed in Japan and can record a single scene simultaneously from multiple angles. A computer can then stitch the . individual images together to create a video clip of that scene, which . can sped up or slowed down. The . effect the system creates is called 'bullet time' and is the same . effect used in 1999 film The Matrix in which the main character Neo is . shown dodging bullets in slow motion as a camera virtually moves the . audience 360-degrees around the shot. NHK's system uses eight cameras, each one used for various pans, tilts and zooms. These eight cameras move in tandem with one main camera that can be moved around the action. Each of the remote-controlled 'Hi-Vision' HDTV cameras is equipped with . two motors for left-right pans, up-down tilts and zooms. Japanese broadcaster NHK's system uses eight cameras, each one used . for various pans, tilts and zooms. These eight cameras move in tandem . with one main camera that can be moved around the action . Bullet Time is also known as frozen time, the big freeze, dead time, flow motion, or time slice. It is a special and visual effect that refers to a digitally enhanced simulation of variable-speeds, such as  slow motion and time-lapse photography. It is used in films, adverts and video games. Bullet Time slows the images down but also changes the camera angle by moving around the scene changing the audience's point of view. This isn't possible with traditional cameras because the cameras would have move round a scene at the same speed at which the event is taking place. This makes it impossible. The term 'bullet time' is a registered trademark of Warner Bros who first used it in March 2005 in the video game The Matrix Online. It was also used to promote the 1999 The Matrix film. As the main camera moves, the eight cameras follow the action with it, pointed at different angles. This lets the cameras keep up with quickly moving players and provide multi-view imaging of the same event. This . makes it possible for a single cameraman to operate all of the cameras . and have them all pointing at the same moving object. The . images are then automatically stitched together into video feeds and . can be used within minutes for analysis during live sporting events. The broadcaster plans to trial the . camera set-up during sports matches to check for fouls and when balls . leave the court or pitch, for example. The . system could also be used as an alternative to the Hawk Eye system that . can slow down images during sports matches for analysis and refereeing . decisions. NHK's system is similar to the set-up used by the Wachowski brothers during the filming of their 1999 film The Matrix. Various scenes in the film are shown in slow-motion and the camera pans around a single shot. This led to the term 'bullet time' being coined and trademarked by Warner Bros, the film's distributor. Bullet Time is also known as frozen time, the big freeze, dead time, flow motion, or time slice. To see more of the DigInfo News video of how the system works click here.

"A little boy was left fighting for his life after a horrific allergic reaction to epilepsy medication made his skin fall off in chunks. Five-year-old Ellis Stacey developed a one-in-a-million condition that gripped his body, covering his skin in agonising blisters. Within days, the skin on his face, back, arms and legs had peeled off. His devastated parents were warned he could die within days as the condition ravaged his body. Scroll down for video . Ellis Stacey, 5, suffered a rare, horrific allergic reaction to epilepsy medication that left his skin covered in agonising blisters. His parents were warned he might not survive the week . Ellis was given the drug Tegretol after an epileptic fit. But within days, he had developed a painful rash . Thankfully, the he has now made a full recovery and is back at school enjoying the new term with his friends. Ellis' ordeal began in September 2013, when he suffered an epileptic fit on his first day of school. His GP prescribed Tegretol, a common medication for epilepsy, and Ellis was advised to rest at his home in Winton, Bournemouth. The drug is also known as carbamazepine. But within days, he had developed a painful red rash. His mother, Kayleigh Drayton, 25, said: 'Ellis kept telling me that he felt poorly. I knew something wasn't right, so I took him back to the GP. 'He basically told me that everything was fine, but I wouldn't give up. 'I asked for a second opinion, and it was only then that I was told Ellis was having a serious allergic reaction and that I needed to take him to hospital.' By the time the family arrived at the Poole Hospital in Dorset, Ellis' condition had deteriorated significantly. His face had swollen up, and he had agonising red blisters in his mouth and throat. Hooked up to a morphine drip to ease the pain, Ellis was unable to eat and required around-the-clock care. Two days later, after being transferred to the Southampton General Hospital, he was finally diagnosed with the life-threatening condition Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which kills up to 40 per cent of sufferers. The condition causes the cells in skin to die before shedding - rather like a snake's. Victims develop terrible scarring all over their bodies and well as severe conjunctivitis which can lead to blindness and mouth infections which can stop them eating. The NHS website lists SJS as a 'very rare' side effects from taking Tegretol. It was then that doctors warned Ellis might not  make it through to the next week. Ellis' mother Kayleigh, 25, said it took her pushing for a second opinion before he was diagnosed with a serious allergic reaction to the epilepsy drug.  Ellis was later diagnosed with the life-threatening condition Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which kills up to 40 per cent of sufferers . Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is a severe adverse reaction to a medication. It was named after two U.S paediatricians who described it in 1922. The condition is incurable and 40 per cent of people who contract the condition do not survive. It affects around two people per million and is more common among women. Symptoms include skin rashes, blisters in the mouth, ears and nose and swelling of the eyelids. If left untreated the condition can result in death. Possible complications include permanent blindness and lung damage. Once diagnosed doctors will immediately stop the patient taking the offending drug. Treatment includes IV fluids and high calorie formulas to promote healing. Antibiotics are given when necessary to prevent secondary infections such as sepsis. Pain medications such as morphine can make the patient more comfortable. Ms Drayton, a full-time mother, said: 'We were absolutely devastated. Ellis was so frightened and kept asking why he hurt so much. 'Because of all of the morphine, he was completely out of it and didn't understand what was going on. 'I couldn't even hug him, as his skin could have fallen off in chunks. 'It broke my heart to see him so afraid, but Carl and I had to stay strong for him. 'We were terrified that we were going to lose him forever.' Over the next two weeks, Ms Drayton and Ellis's father Carl, an aerospace technician, kept vigil as their son was was attached to a feeding tube and pumped with steroids to treat the reaction. To save his skin and sight, doctors applied eye drops and changed his dressings every two hours. It was essential that his eyes and lips were kept lubricated in order to prevent his eyes from scarring and his lips from fusing together. Finally, after three weeks in hospital, Ellis was well enough to return home in October 2013. His mother said: 'We just prayed he would pull through. Our friends and family helped out as we spent all of the time we could by his side. 'When I could hug him for the first time, it was the best feeling ever. We'd come so close to losing him, and I never wanted to let him go. 'He was still very poorly, but we knew that we were over the worst of it.' Ellis quickly settled back into family life with his little sister, Belle, two, and soon began to recover. Although he still has scarring and now suffers from asthma, he has fully recovered and recently enjoyed his first week back at school. Ms Drayton said: 'It's brilliant to see Ellis so happy again, and his dad and I are so proud of him. 'He's on a new medication for his epilepsy, which he's responding really well to. 'His little sister Belle has also taken to making sure he's not poorly again. She dresses up as a doctor and prods him with a stethoscope to make sure everything's working properly. 'I'm so grateful that doctors were able to treat Ellis in time. Now we're looking forward to the future as a happy, healthy family.' Ellis, pictured left with his mother, father Carl and sister Belle, has now recovered and is back at school . Eugene Healy, professor of dermatology at University Hospital Southampton, said: 'Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a type of severe immune reaction, usually against a drug or medication, but sometimes against an infection. 'SJS is more common in adults, but can occur at any age, including children. 'It involves the skin and the mucous membranes - including the lips, mouth and eyes - and is closely related to a condition called toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which causes large areas of skin to die and is often fatal without treatment. 'Fortunately with expert medical and nursing help, many patients survive SJS. However, it is essential for the patient never to take the culprit drug again as long as they live, otherwise there is a very high risk of an even worse reaction.' A spokesperson for Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, which manufactures Tegretol, said: 'We are committed to patient safety and strictly comply with local and international regulations. 'Serious dermatological reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported very rarely with Tegretol. 'For all of its products, Novartis evaluates and reviews its global safety database on an ongoing basis.'","Ellis Stacy was given the drug Tegretol after suffering an epileptic fit .

"This is the incredible moment a brave antelope tried to shake off a hungry lioness - by trying to launch her into the air. The beast became the lion's prime target for dinner, after it ran directly into a hungry pride at the MalaMala game reserve, in South Africa. When the young lioness finally caught up with the panicking bull, he clearly wasn't about to give up without a fight - and tried to launch the lion through the air after putting in an almighty buck. But despite getting rid of one lion, the young kudu, a type of antelope, was soon surrounded by a huge group of ravenous lions - and before long was on the menu. The pursuit is on: The brave kudu tried to escape the hungry lioness - but it was not to be, and the creature finally succumbed to the herd .

Gary said: 'We were watching a pride of nineteen lions resting on the open banks of the Sand River. 'Two lionesses left the scene and we lost sight of them heading up the steep river bank. 'Their intentions were soon revealed when three large kudu bulls where flushed out of the bush some distance upstream. 'In the panic, one of the bulls selected the wrong escape route. At full speed, he galloped unknowingly toward where the rest of the pride were laying in ambush. 'We could see the beast steaming in from at least three hundred metres away and had plenty of time to get the cameras ready.'

With this many lions present, the feeding was over after a mere half hour. 'Interestingly it was a sub-adult from the pride that executed the takedown which was an impressive feat for a youngster. 'At one stage, a small breeding herd of elephants came by. At first it looked as though they would pass without a fuss but without warning some of the members of the herd charged at the lions. 'This was enough to scatter the lions in every direction. Some young cubs struggled to get away as they treaded in water up to their bellies but eventually they managed to get out of harm's way.'","...Sadly, creature did not stand a chance after lion ambush at MalaMala game reserve in South Africa ."
"The Republican-controlled House voted Tuesday to condemn President Barack Obama for failing to give 30-day notice to Congress about the exchange in May of American prisoner Bowe Bergdahl for five Taliban leaders held at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The vote was 249-163, with 22 Democrats — many locked in tough re-election races — breaking ranks and backing the nonbinding resolution. 'By setting free five top Taliban commanders from U.S. custody, the Obama administration made Americans less safe,' Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. Scroll down for video . House Republicans passed a resolution on Tuesday condemning President Barack Obama for failing to give a 30-day notice to Congress about the May exchange of five Taliban commanders for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, pictured here in an undated photo provided by the Army . Republicans insist that Obama clearly violated a law requiring the administration to notify Congress at least 30 days before transferring prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay prison. A Government Accountability Office report last month also reached that conclusion. 'The administration deprived Congress of the opportunity to consider the national security risk or the repercussions of negotiating with terrorists,' House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon said. Five senior Taliban were released from the U.S. prison at Guantanamo in exchange for the Army sergeant who had disappeared from his post in Paktika province in eastern Afghanistan on June 30, 2009. The five Taliban men are to remain in Qatar for a year. Republican lawmakers and some Democrats were angry with Obama and members of the administration for failing to notify them about the swap even as 80 to 90 members of the government knew of the exchange. The administration has offered a number of explanations for keeping Congress in the dark, including concern about Bergdahl's health and safety required speedy action and concern that lawmakers would divulge details of the deal and scuttle it. Obama has said his constitutional authority as commander in chief superseded the law to apprise lawmakers. Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the top Democrat on Armed Services, said the president should have notified Congress. But the resolution passed by the House was a partisan attack by a Republicans on a Democratic president, said Smith, who has claimed Republican President George W. Bush repeatedly violated the law with post-Sept. 11 warrantless wiretaps and indefinite detentions. Awkward: The House passed the resolution as President Barack Obama, center, was meeting with Congressional leadership, including Speaker of the House John Boehner  (2nd-left), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (left), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (2nd-right) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, in the Oval Office at the White House . Democratic Rep. Alcee Hastings suggested that the House vote on the measure less than two months before the election was simply an effort to appease core Republican voters. Meanwhile, Rep. John Barrow of Georgia, a Democratic congressman who faces a challenging re-election this fall, backed the resolution, complaining that Obama negotiated with terrorists and treated Congress as an afterthought. Some in Congress have said Bergdahl was a deserter and the United States gave up too much for his freedom. Several lawmakers have cited intelligence suggesting the high-level Taliban officials could return to the Afghanistan battlefield. The House resolution, which lacks the force of law and won't be considered in the Senate, 'condemns and disapproves of the failure of the Obama administration to comply with the lawful 30-day statutory reporting requirement in executing the transfer of five senior members of the Taliban from detention at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.' The measure says these actions 'have burdened unnecessarily the trust and confidence in the commitment and ability of the Obama administration to constructively engage and work with Congress.' The resolution does express relief that Bergdahl has returned safely to the United States. The Joint Chiefs of Staff has unanimously supported the exchange and contend that the United States has a sacred commitment to men and women who serve that it will never leave anyone behind on the battlefield. Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said the swap in May was 'likely our last, best opportunity' to free Bergdahl. Bergdahl is performing administrative duties at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio while an investigation into how he was captured by the Taliban is conducted. The vote castigating Obama on Tuesday came at a crucial moment for the administration as it sought to rally international and congressional support for steps to combat the rising threat of Islamic state militants in Iraq and Syria. The debate and vote coincided with a White House meeting in which the president discussed his strategy to defeat ISIS with House and Senate leaders. It also came on the eve of Obama's address to the nation. 'What poor timing for a resolution,' said Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee.","The vote was 249-163, with 22 Democrats — many locked in tough re-election races — breaking ranks and backing the nonbinding resolution .

"A police officer told colleagues ‘all black people look like monkeys’, a court heard yesterday. PC Kevin Hughes, 42, is accused of making the racist comment as he pointed to three black men leaning against a wall. When challenged, he allegedly replied ‘but it’s true’ before arguing that the men were ‘closely related to chimpanzees and more closely related to Neanderthals’. His comments were alleged to have been made while he was on patrol in Newham, one of London’s most ethnically diverse areas. PC David Hair (left) and PC Kevin Hughes (right) denied their comments - overheard by a colleague - were racist . And his colleague David Hair asked a . black officer if she was staying to do overtime or ‘going home to cook . bananas', it is alleged. Kate Wilkinson, prosecutor, told . Westminster Magistrates Court that PC Hughes was on patrol with PC . Costas Dakoutros when he made the comments. Hair, of Epping, Essex, and Hughes, who met at police training school, both deny making any racist comments. Hughes allegedly made the racist remarks while in a patrol car in Green Street with three colleagues on February 22 after seeing three black men standing on the pavement, the prosecutor said. He allegedly turned to his colleague, PC Costas Dakoutros, who was in the back of the car with him, and said: 'Look at them, they look like f****** monkeys.' 'PC Dakoutros looked shocked and said ‘You can't say that',' Ms Wilkinson said. But Hughes allegedly replied: 'No, but it's true.' 'He began to deliberate that they [black people] were closely related to chimpanzees and then said they were more closely related to Neanderthals,' according to the prosecutor. Giving evidence, PC Dakoutros, who made an immediate note of the incident, said it has had a profound impact on his wellbeing. He said: 'It was horrible. I'd heard the comment and it was always playing on my mind. 'It affected me at the time. I felt I was given something that I didn't know how to deal with. I felt something should be done but I didn't know exactly what to do. I just wanted the matter taken out of my hands.' Charges: The two officers appeared in Westminster Magistrates Court where they denied making racist comments while on duty . He added: 'I stopped sleeping. I put on a bit of weight. I was generally moody. I retreated into myself a lot. 'I was kind of starting to doubt the organisation that I worked for.' PC Dakoutros described a culture of racist banter between Hughes and Hair, who were good friends. He . told the court the pair would refer to each other as 'auntie and . uncle'- using imitation Asian accents in the style of the TV show . Goodness Gracious Me, starring Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhaskar. He . also described an incident in which the pair were on an operation with . an Asian female Special Constable and they decided not to use the term . in case she made an official complaint against them. He said: 'K [Hughes] said we can't use 'auntie' as she might complain. D [Hair] agreed. 'It backed up my initial thoughts that these two officers were aware that someone might complain if they heard it being used.' Another colleague who was in the car said he heard Hughes say: 'Black people hadn't evolved and lived in mud huts in Africa', according to Ms Wilkinson. But under questioning the officer denied being racist and said he was commenting on the way a man walked. Ms Wilkinson said: 'He said he didn't recall seeing three black males but said he saw someone with a certain gait who walked like a monkey and he had said to PC Dakoutros something about a monkey.' 'I didn't know if you were going to go into a little rant and say you were going to go home and cook bananas.' - Alleged words of PC Hair to black colleague . Hair is alleged to have made racist comments to his black colleague, PC Julia Dacres, on March 13. PC Dacres lived in south London and so would not regularly work overtime as she found it difficult to travel home late at night, Ms Wilkinson told the court. While on patrol, Hair asked PC Dacres if she was going to do any overtime, to which she sarcastically laughed and said she would. Hair then allegedly said: 'I didn't know if you were going to go into a little rant and say you were going to go home and cook bananas.' Ms Wilkinson said PC Dacres was 'stunned' by this comment and replied: 'That is a weird concoction. Is that what you had for dinner?' PC Dakoutros said when he heard the comment, he initially thought it was an ongoing joke', but 'when I spoke to PC Dacres, about it, it had obviously upset her'. Hughes was present in the police van at the time. 'PC Hughes admitted hearing the comment and said it was stupid,' Ms Wilkinson said. Hair admitted making the comment but said it was not racist because he 'could have named any food', according to Ms Wilkinson. She added: 'He does not deny the statement but asserts it was made with no racial connotation.' The prosecutor also said the pair, who worked in the North East Victim Offender Location Time team (Volt), regularly mocked Asian culture while working, which distressed some colleagues. Hughes and Hair would call each other 'aunty' and 'uncle', common terms in Asian culture for elders, using mock accents 'such as those heard on television comedy series', Ms Wilkinson said. Senior staff never challenged the pair for this, she said. The decision to charge the officers came after an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) following a referral of the complaints in April. The Met said both officers were suspended from duty on 5 April. The case continues.

"Under the hammer: Leonard Nimoy, in his trademark tunic, has his gun drawn as Spock . From Star Trek to The Ten Commandments, some of the most iconic props in Hollywood history are expected to go under the hammer this month. Memorabilia from dozens of films, including a full-scale alien from the Aliens films and dinosaurs from Jurassic Park, will be sold at 'The Hollywood Auction' in California on December 15. Included in the sale is James Bond's suit, as worn by Pierce Brosnan in The World is Not Enough, and the tunic (and ears) worn by Spock in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, which is boldly expected to go for more than £75,000. The iconic Spock tunic was worn by Leonard Nimoy in Star Trek as the mixed human-Vulcan first officer. Complete with original rank braiding on the sleeves, the piece has been locked away since 1968 - but the colour is still as vibrant as ever. It was won by a viewer who entered a competition to design a costume for the cult Paramount TV show and has been kept by them ever since. Spock's pointed screen-worn ears, used in Star Trek: The Modern Picture, could set bidders back £1,250. They are made from foam rubber and measure just two inches square. Also up for auction are The Tablets . of Stone used by Charlton Heston when he played Moses in the 1956 film, . The Ten Commandments. The tablets come with a letter of authenticity from the creator, Paramount Studios scenic artist A.J. Ciraolo. He made the tablets to be slightly irregular with craters so they appeared to be carved with God's 'fire bolts'. To boldly go under the hammer: Mr Spock's famous blue tunic is up for sale, for an astronomical £75,000 . You can buy morals: The tablets carried by Charlton Heston come with a letter of authenticity from the creator, Paramount Studios scenic artist A.J. Ciraolo . It could be you: Charlton Heston as Moses in the 1956 epic . Indiana Jones fanatics can purchase the gun used by Harrison Ford in Raiders of The Lost Ark for 50,000 pounds. The . six-shot revolver is an original film-modified Smith & Wesson Hand . Ejector Mk II and was used through the majority of filming in Tunisia. Ford used the weapon in the shoot-out at the Raven bar - one of the most memorable scenes in the movie. It is one of only two pistols that exist today that were used by Ford in the production of the film. Science . fiction enthusiasts will have the opportunity to purchase the full . alien warrior creature costume from Aliens for £75,000. Aliens, directed in 1986, was a sequel to Alien, filmed seven years earlier. The costume is the finest example of only three full suits that survived the filming more than 25 years ago. Bidders also have the chance to walk away wearing the suit worn by Pierce Brosnan as James Bond in The World Is Not Enough. The suit, made by Brioni of Italy is expected to go for around 12,500 pounds. Inside the interior pocket tag is typewritten: 'James Bond 3 - Pierce Brosnan'. Indy's gun: The weapon features in an iconic, unscripted scene where Indy shoots a man brandishing a whip - the story is that Harrison Ford was ill during filming, and urged the director to remove an elaborate fight scene in favour of a literal quick shoot . Less scary in miniature: A T-Rex, from when Jurassic Park was going to be created entirely through models. Then effects company Industrial Light and Magic convinced Spielberg to use CGI - and movie magic was born .

"Jailed: Kweku Adoboli was convicted of two counts of fraud after abusing his position at UBS . Swiss banking giant UBS has been fined £29.7million by the City watchdog for failings which allowed rogue trader Kweku Adoboli to lose £1.4billion. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) said procedures, management systems and internal controls at the bank’s London branch were 'seriously defective'. Adoboli was sentenced to seven years in prison last week after he was convicted of two counts of fraud by abuse of position. Tracey McDermott, FSA director of enforcement and financial crime, said: 'UBS’s systems and controls were seriously defective.' She said: 'As a result, Adoboli, a relatively junior trader, was allowed to take vast and risky market positions, and UBS failed to manage the risks around that properly. 'We know from past experience that failures to manage risk properly can cause firms to fail and cause systemic harm.' UBS became aware that unauthorised trading had taken place on the Exchange Traded Funds Desk in London on September 14 last year. Adoboli disguised the underlying positions by the use of late bookings of real trades and the booking of fictitious trades. At one point the former public school . head boy driven by a 'lust for wealth' was on the verge of losing the . Swiss bank £7.5billion, which prosecutors said would have led to its . collapse. Sasha Wass QC told jurors that he was 'a gamble or two away from destroying Switzerland's largest bank for his own gain'. The £1.4billion loss he caused - . revealed when Adoboli sent a bombshell email to colleagues - wiped . around 10% - £2.8billion - off UBS's share price. The FSA, in an investigation with the . Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma), uncovered several . 'particularly serious' failings which put wider market confidence at . risk and allowed Adoboli to commit financial crime. The . computerised system operated by UBS to assist in risk management was . not effective, the regulators said, while its trade capture and . processing system had 'significant deficiencies'. Regulators said UBS's computerised system had 'significant deficiencies' - allowing Adoboli's excessive trades . Inadequate front office supervision was discovered including poorly executed and ineffective supervision arrangements within the GSE division. Adoboli was at one point on the verge of causing losses of $12billion (£7.5billion), and the hole he eventually left was the largest trading loss ever in British banking history. Prosecutors claimed Adoboli - who was heavily involved in spread-betting in his spare time - was a gambler who believed he had the 'magic touch'. The 32-year-old admitted the enormous losses but claimed he was pressured by staff to take risks, culminating in a catastrophe which wiped £2.8billion off the bank’s share value. James Carlton, a partner specialising in areas of business crime and regulation at Fox Williams, said: 'This case illustrates that Kweku Adoboli, while ""rogue"", could not have achieved what he did without there being significant failings within the overall trading operations and UBS clearly accepts a degree of corporate culpability for this. 'This case continues to underline the need for all financial institutions to have in place, and to continually monitor, highly comprehensive control systems which effectively balance the conflicting needs between regulatory compliance and corporate profit.' After being educated at the . £26,000-a-year Ackworth School in West Yorkshire, Adoboli toyed with . becoming a chemical engineer. But he accepted an offer from the . University of Nottingham to study a degree in e-commerce and digital . business. After graduating he was lured to UBS . with tales of the millions that could be made. Despite his penchant for . partying, he did well at the bank and was transferred from the back . office to a trading desk in 2006. He was given a £360,000 package of salary and bonuses, promoted to a crack ‘Delta One’ team within UBS and put in charge of a £30billion trading book. Fall from grace: Kweku Adoboli, 32, pictured last year following his arrest. He has been jailed for seven years . The banker used his salary to fund the freewheeling lifestyle typical of a brash City trader, holding raucous parties at his £1,000-a-week loft apartment. But it was there that his ‘naked gambling’ ran out of control. He wiped £2.8billion off the bank’s share price and threatened the jobs of many of his colleagues as the City struggled to recover from the recession. A police officer who investigated the fraud said Adoboli’s actions were ‘felt in financial centres around the world’. His losses would have been enough to pay a year’s salary for 70,000 nurses or build six hospitals. They also dwarf the £827million lost by rogue trader Nick Leeson, who brought down Barings Bank in the early 1990s.","Watchdog slams UBS's computer systems which allowed 'junior trader' to take risky trades .

The Met Office said it had extended its yellow warning for further ice across large swathes of the country amid the threat of more rain and sub-zero temperatures. ‘There’s going to be a widespread frost on Saturday morning across large parts of the country and a few icy stretches,’ warned Met Office forecaster Charles Powell. ‘That risk will continue. We’ve extended our yellow warning for much of northern England advising people to be aware and remain vigilant and that’ll stay in place over much of the weekend. ‘There will also be one or two showers across the Cornish coast. ‘We have a little bit of snow on the way and that clump of rain, sleet and snow will gradually make its way southwards from Scotland. ‘By Saturday morning the snow will have reached the Pennines and the North Yorkshire moors with up to 4cm falling in places. ‘It will continue southwards throughout the day but it will get increasingly weak and light.

The Environment Agency is said to be closely monitoring the situation amid fears of further flooding. By Monday milder temperatures are . expected to give a little light relief before another cold front hits . the country on Wednesday. ‘Next week will begin with relatively mild temperatures,’ added Mr Powell. ‘We could get as high as double figures, that’s up a couple of degrees on what we have had recently. ‘By Wednesday it will get a lot colder, the snow showers will return and temperatures will drop below freezing again.’ Cold morning: Frost covers Somerset as Glastonbury Tor shivers in the distance . As Leicester shimmers in the background,the ground freezes, with temperatures plunging to zero overnight . Forecaster Stephen Davenport of . MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, added a front . of rain was moving south, bringing wintry conditions with it. 'There’s going to be a mixture of rain, sleet, hail and snow showers,' he said. 'In the northern parts of the country, over the hills, there will be a 2cm to 3cm covering of snow with up to 4cm in some spots. 'There may be snow showers down the . eastern side of the country.

Met Office has urged motorists to remain vigilant ahead, while councils . have stockpiled 1.3million tons of road salt and have hundreds of . gritters on standby.

The Government announced £120million new funding for flood defences today, as families in parts of the country face the aftermath of more flooding. Ministers said £60million would be targeted at areas where improving defences against flooding could unlock investment and growth in the area, and the rest would go to speed up delivery of up to 50 schemes already in the pipeline. The Government estimates the money, which will be delivered between next year and 2015, will improve flood protection for up to 60,000 homes and provide one billion pounds in economic benefits. Potential projects which could benefit from the funding targeted at unlocking economic benefits include Leeds, where the riverside area is regularly threatened by floods and defences could protect 250 businesses, employing more than 100,000 people, and more than 3,100 homes. The Government said the money was in addition to the £2billion being spent on flooding and coastal erosion this spending period up to 2015, more than one billion pounds of which is for capital projects such as flood defences.

"The father of a New York City teen who drowned on a class trip in June received a phone call from the school last week to discuss his son’s poor attendance.

"Iraqi forces broke through to the jihadist-besieged Shiite town of Amerli today where thousands of people have been trapped for more than two months with dwindling food and water supplies. It is the biggest offensive success for the Iraqi government since militants led by the Sunni Islamic State  jihadist group overran large areas of five provinces in June, sweeping security forces aside. The breakthrough came as America carried out limited strikes outside north Iraq for the first time since its air campaign against the militants began more than three weeks ago, and aircraft from several countries dropped humanitarian aid to Amerli.

A militiaman wears a balaclava with a skeleton  design as he poses for a photo with other armed comrades . The mainly Shiite Turkmen residents of the town in Salaheddin province were running desperately short of food and water, and were in danger both because of their Shiite faith, which jihadists consider heresy, and their resistance to the militants, which has drawn harsh retribution elsewhere. 'Our forces entered Amerli and broke the siege,' Iraqi security spokesman Lieutenant General Qassem Atta said, an account confirmed by a local official and a fighter from the town. 'It is a very important success,' Atta later said on state television, adding that there was still fighting in the area. The operation was launched on Saturday after days of preparations in which Iraqi security forces, Shiite militiamen and Kurdish fighters deployed for the assault and Iraqi aircraft carried out strikes against militants. The U.S. had carried out air strikes  against Islamic State fighters near the town  in northern Iraq and airdropped humanitarian aid to civilians trapped there, the Pentagon said. President Barack Obama authorised the new military action, broadening U.S. operations in Iraq amid an international outcry over the threat to Amerli's mostly ethnic Turkmen population.

U.S. aircraft delivered over a hundred bundles of emergency supplies and more aid was dropped from British, French and Australian planes, officials said, signaling headway in Obama's efforts to draw allies into the fight against Islamic State. Iraqi army and Kurdish forces closed in on Islamic State fighters in a push to break the Sunni militants' siege of Amerli, which has been surrounded by the militants for more than two months. Armed residents of Amerli have managed to fend off attacks by Islamic State fighters, who regard the town's majority Shi'ite Turkmen population as apostates. More than 15,000 people remain trapped inside. 'At the request of the government of Iraq, the United States military today airdropped humanitarian aid to the town of Amerli, home to thousands of Shia Turkmen who have been cut off from receiving food, water, and medical supplies for two months by ISIL,' Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said, using an alternative name for Islamic State. 'In conjunction with this airdrop, U.S. aircraft conducted coordinated air strikes against nearby ISIL terrorists in order to support this humanitarian assistance operation,' he said, adding that a key objective was to prevent a militant attack on civilians in the town. He said the operations would be 'limited in their scope and duration' in order to protect Amerli's population. Warplanes hit three Humvee patrol vehicles, a tank and an armed vehicle held by militants in addition to a checkpoint controlled by the group, according to the military's Central Command, which runs U.S. operations in the Middle East. 'All aircraft safely exited the area,' it said in a statement. When Obama ordered the first air strikes and air drops in Iraq earlier this month, he justified the military operation in part to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe for thousands of ethnic Yazidis trapped by Islamic State militants on Sinjar mountain in northern Iraq. Islamic State militants overran most of Sunni Arab areas of Iraq after seizing the northern city of Mosul on June 10 . The town of Amerli is around 100 miles north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad . This is the area, straddling Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State group claimed to have control of . In mid-August, he declared that the militant siege there had been broken. Earlier on Saturday, two officers said Iraqi troops, militia and Kurdish peshmerga were advancing on Amerli from four directions. A major in the Iraqi army, who was advancing north towards Amerli from Udhaim, said progress was slow because the militants had mined the roads. He said they were around 15 km (9 miles) from the town, while those approaching from the north were just 3 km away. The major said he had counted the corpses of more than 40 militants killed in Iraqi air strikes on the road between Udhaim and the village of Injana. Also on Saturday, the Pentagon said U.S. warplanes and armed drones had carried out five air strikes on Islamic State fighters near Iraq's largest dam, the latest in a series of attacks in support of Iraqi and Kurdish forces. The strikes destroyed an Islamic State armed vehicle, a fighting position and weapons, and damaged a building near Mosul Dam, the Pentagon said. Backed by U.S. air power, Kurdish forces recaptured the strategic facility nearly two weeks ago. Separately on Saturday, a suicide bomber driving a car packed with explosives killed at least 11 people at a checkpoint in the town of Yusifiya, 15 km (9 miles) south of Baghdad, a police officer said. Islamic State militants overran most of Sunni Arab areas of Iraq after seizing the northern city of Mosul on June 10, and have proclaimed a caliphate straddling the border with Syria, where they also control vast swaths of territory. The lightning offensive brought the militants within range of the capital of Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region earlier this month, prompting air strikes by the United States.

"Former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty has warned current incumbant Louis van Gaal that he will alienate the club's fans if they don't start playing to their traditional strengths. Van Gaal's tactics have been criticised by many recently with his usage of striker Wayne Rooney in a central midfield role one sticking point, while Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie faulter up front. On Friday, United legend Paul Scholes described the Red Devils' brand of football 'miserable', while another ex-stalwart, Gary Neville caused a stir when he compared them to a pub side earlier this season. Former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty believes Louis van Gaal needs to change his tactics .

And Docherty believes Van Gaal must improve his team's style or face a wrath of disgruntlement from the fans. 'Van Gaal's record abroad is fantastic, with Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Ajax,' said Docherty, speaking on behalf of William Hill, Official Supporter of the FA Cup. 'All those teams played great football under him but he's got to start producing very, very quickly at United. The supporters will expect them to be doing better than they are at the moment. 'Once the crowd start to get on you if you don't give them what they want – and they're the ones who pay your salary – they'll start showing disillusionment with the way the team is playing. 'The fans at United have been brought up with great football – two wingers going down the touchline, raining crosses in to the strikers. That's not happening. 'You've got to give the supporters what they want, and you can't really see a lot of progress at the moment, with the money he's already spent, let alone the money he's set to spend this summer.'","Former Manchester United boss Tommy Docherty spoke out about  Louis van Gaal's tactics .

"'Nothing short of appalling': Leslie Pringle, from North Shields, has been jailed for three and a half years . A photographer who infected a lover with HIV by failing to tell her he had the disease has been jailed for three-and-a-half years. Leslie Pringle did not inform the woman, referred to only as X in court, he had the disease before they started a sexual relationship. The 48-year-old had denied causing X grievous bodily harm but was found guilty by a jury after a trial. Prosecutors said Pringle, who publicly apologised to his victim through his barrister, had a 'cavalier' attitude to sex and disregard for the safety of others. At Newcastle Crown Court yesterday Judge Paul Sloan QC branded Pringle 'utterly irresponsible and selfish.' The judge told him: 'At no time during the relationship did you inform X of your HIV positive status. 'Worse than that, you deliberately concealed that positive status from her. 'When you did take medication you hid the medication, and the fact you were taking it, from her and you also kept your visits to the clinic from her. 'She trusted you implicitly, it never crossed her mind that you were HIV positive. 'She believed it was a safe relationship, given your account to her that previous relationships had been long standing. 'Needless to say, the revelation she was HIV positive had a devastating effect upon her, leading to severe and continuing emotional and physical problems in addition to the serious psychological harm you caused her. 'Having regard to the victim personal statement, clearly X’s life has been changed forever. 'She speaks of depression, a sense of worthlessness. 'She speaks of her nightmares, her fragile state. She speaks of trust remaining a huge issue for her. You were advised in terms to tell all partners of your status and I am satisfied you deliberately chose not to, thereby denying X choice. 'You chose, quite deliberately, to ignore repeated warnings and advice you were given by the clinic.' The court heard during the trial Pringle had been repeatedly advised on how to avoid passing on the disease - as well as the importance of condoms - after he was diagnosed. He had also been warned of his legal and moral obligation to inform sexual partners of his illness. But Pringle, of Rennington Avenue, North Shields, had sex with the woman without using protection and had not been regularly taking his medication or attending clinic appointments to try and control his illness, as he had been advised. Tramatic: 'X' told jurors she collapsed when she tested positive for the disease (file picture) Following the conviction in October, the victim known as X said: 'The selfish behaviour of Les Pringle is nothing short of appalling. 'Through the position he now finds himself in, I hope he uses this time to reflect on the damage he has done through his treatment of others, and learn something of compassion.' Pringle did not give evidence during the trial but told detectives in interview he believed it was still possible for him to have safe sex even without the use of a condom. X told jurors during the trial, while giving evidence from behind a screen to protect her privacy, she confronted Pringle at his studio after was told she had the disease and suspected he had given her it. She told the court: 'It was rage, it is the only word I can use to describe it. 'I am a very calm, private person really and I don’t think I have ever felt that way before. 'The deceit just beggars belief. It was an unpleasant experience feeling like that. I hope one day I can move on from it'. The woman told jurors Pringle had told her during the confrontation he 'wasn’t dealing with it' after getting his own diagnosis. She added: 'I said quite a few unpleasant things in the heat of the moment. 'I tried to slap him across the face. It didn’t work - he caught my wrist and told me to calm down.' Lies: 'X' said she would have continued her relationship with Pringle if he had not kept the secret from her . X told jurors she would have used condoms if she had known Pringle was HIV positive but would not have ended their relationship for that reason alone. She said: 'People with HIV are allowed to have relationships, are allowed to lead a healthy life. 'The irony of it is he has said he didn’t tell me because he was frightened he would lose me. 'He lost me because he didn’t tell me. 'It would have made no difference to how I felt about him if he had told me, I would have thought he was a very, very brave man and I would have supported him.' The woman told jurors she 'collapsed' after being told she had tested positive for the disease during a health check, after her relationship with Pringle had ended. She told jurors she 'regrettably' did not use condoms while having sex with Pringle and they were never suggested or discussed. She said: 'It was because I was in love with him, because I thought it was a safe relationship, I felt safe in it. 'I think it was serious from the first time that we went out on the very first date. 'It was, on reflection, difficult to describe because it was a very stupid thing to do. 'I think I was just so happy he had asked me to go out with him and spend some time with him it just never crossed my mind.' The woman told jurors she never saw Pringle taking medication other than Paracetomol for headaches and minor ailments and believed his health to be excellent. Prosecutor Katherine Dunn told the court: 'The crown’s case is he was clearly reckless in his actions in not telling her he was infected, not attending the clinic and not taking his medication . 'He failed to protect X by engaging in sexual intercourse without protection. 'It shows his cavalier approach to sex and disregard for the safety of others and complete lack of concern as to whether he could infect another person.' Pringle told police very few people were aware of his HIV status and said he tried to kill himself twice after the confrontation with X. Speaking after the case, X added in a statement released by police: 'The actions of Les Pringle towards myself have taken away so many choices I should have been entitled to, therefore I ask that I am allowed to continue to lead a private and dignified life as is my human right. 'I would like to take this opportunity to urge anyone who has had a relationship with Les Pringle to contact their Sexual Health Services and request HIV testing. 'Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent irretrievable breakdown of good health, and ultimately saves lives. The care and support I received has helped me enormously in re-building my life. 'Should any persons feel it necessary to talk to the police, I want to state with complete confidence that without prejudice or judgement, the respect and kindness I have received has shown no bounds. 'There is no shame in having an HIV test, or indeed being HIV positive. Look after yourself and others, going for a test may well save your life.' Robert Ellison, defending, said Pringle was in a state of 'denial' after his diagnosis and had to cope with the death of both his parents within a short time of each other as well as the collapse of his business. Mr Ellison said: 'When the offence was committed, the information available suggests, this man was not in his right mind and that may have effected his appreciation of the level of risk he posed to other people. 'The doctor’s report describes his response to diagnosis as a state of denial. 'It led to certain behaviour such that he didn’t treat himself, he pretended it hadn’t happened. 'He, according to the doctor, was living in something close to a fantasy world where it hadn’t happened at all.' Mr Ellison said Pringle is now a 'different man' who is acting responsibly in relation to his illness. He added: 'He expresses very deep sorrow and remorse about the victim in this case.'","Leslie Pringle, 48, did not use protection and allowed lover to become infected .

"A local authority has been fined £30,000 for health and safety failures linked to a warehouse blaze in which four firefighters died. Mr Justice MacDuff said the fine imposed on Warwickshire County Council reflected deficiencies in record-keeping and information given to fire crews at the time of the tragedy in November 2007. During his sentencing remarks at Stafford Crown Court, the judge described the deaths in Atherstone-on-Stour as a 'dreadful accident' caused by a series of mishaps and failures which occurred together. Victims: (clockwise from top left) Darren Yates-Badley, Ashley Stephens, Ian Reid and John Averis were killed  tackling the blaze in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, in 2007. Their families are angry at the fire service's reaction to the manslaughter acquittal . Deadly: The 2007 warehouse fire took the lives of four of Warwickshire's firemen . A jury cleared Adrian Ashley, 45, and . 51-year-old Timothy Woodward of gross negligence manslaughter after . hearing six weeks of evidence about the deaths of Ashley Stephens, . Darren Yates-Badley, John Averis and Ian Reid. A . third defendant, 50-year-old Watch Manager Paul Simmons, was acquitted . of manslaughter on the directions of the judge part-way through the . trial. Warwickshire County . Council, which employs firefighters in the county, pleaded guilty in . January this year to a charge brought under the Health and Safety at . Work Act following a criminal inquiry into the blaze. Although . the council pleaded guilty on a limited basis, the charge stated that . it had failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare of its employees . contrary to Section 2 of the Act. Three . fire service incident commanders also prosecuted in connection with the . death were acquitted of four counts of manslaughter at the same court . earlier this year. Passing . sentence on the county council today, Mr Justice MacDuff was critical of . aspects of the Crown’s case against the three incident commanders. Ruling . that senior fire officers had been correct to send crews wearing . breathing apparatus into the warehouse, the judge said the main expert . witness for the prosecution had not been 'fair or balanced' during parts . of his evidence. The Atherstone fire: The blaze led to the deaths of four firefighters . Warwickshire County Council will be sentenced for health and safety breaches linked to the warehouse fire . Describing parts of the prosecution’s case - including an assertion that the incident commanders had behaved like First World War generals - as 'unacceptable', the judge noted: 'All those who attended on that day were qualified firefighters, also experts. 'Prosecution witness after witness went into the witness box and - with a singular exception - spoke in support of the decision to commit men to locate and fight the fire. 'If it needs me to say so, this dreadful accident was caused, as so many accidents are, by a series of mishaps occurring together, by a whole host of causes, some being more potent than others.' Counsel for the county council conceded that the area's fire authority was guilty of failings in its duty to provide building risk information and details of the location of water supplies to its crews. It also accepted deficiencies in record-keeping relating to training. Collapse: An aerial view shows the roof of the warehouse after it collapsed killing the four firefighters . The Fire Brigade Union said it was absurd that the arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial, while those who struggled to put it out were 'relentlessly pursued' by police and the CPS . Explaining how he calculated the level of the fine, Mr Justice MacDuff said: 'In my judgment it is entirely clear that the absence of water information had no bearing on this case at all. 'There was at all times an adequate water supply and no different course would have been taken if the location, for example, of the nearest hydrants had been known. 'As to training, I am equally clear that there can be no causative link, finding as I do that the training deficiencies were largely concerned with records, the decision to begin offensive firefighting was a correct one, and nothing that happened that night would have been affected.' Although the lack of a card giving information about the warehouse might have been a contributory factor in the tragedy, the judge said it was of little weight compared with 'all the other unfortunate and unforeseeable factors' surrounding the deaths. The judge prefaced his sentencing remarks by praising the bravery of those who entered the burning warehouse which was destroyed in the blaze. 'This was a tragic case involving the deaths of four fine men,' he told the court. 'I know that their relatives have taken a close interest in this case and I believe that some of them attended every day of the earlier trial as well as this hearing. 'I also wish it to be known that I have read the impact statements and I understand the anguish which is felt at the loss of the lives of young men - men who had their lives ahead of them, men who were following their calling either as retained firefighters or full-timers. 'Men who went into the fire compartment fearlessly in what, at the time, was perceived to be a routine piece of firefighting.'","Four firefighters died tackling .

The 23-year-old driver had to be freed by fire crews after his 20-tonne vehicle crashed into the gable end of a house in Broad Lane in Rochdale. Firefighters had to cut away part of the vehicle's roof and the driver was taken into hospital. Gritted pavement: The salt from the lorry was spread all over the side of the pavement in Broad Lane, Rochdale . Accident: The driver of a gritting lorry had to be freed after it crashed and overturned . Injuries: The driver was taken to the Royal Oldham Hospital with cuts on his face and an arm injury . A family were in bed in the house when the crash happened at the road's junction with Waddington Fold just after 6am today. Up to 20 firefighters including members of a specialist rescue unit, were called to the scene, along with police and paramedics. Watch manager Thomas Hague, from Rochdale Fire Station, said: 'We discovered a gritting lorry on its side and a man trapped between the road and the cab section of the lorry. 'We stabilised the vehicle then cut off the roof. 'In consultation with the ambulance service, we got the man out through the roof. He had injuries to his arm but he was conscious and breathing. 'The lorry had collided with a detached house causing slight damage to the gable end of the house.

Clean-up: Up to 20 firefighters including members of a specialist rescue unit, were called to the scene . The driver was taken to the Royal Oldham Hospital with cuts on his face and an arm injury. It is thought the Mercedes gritter was heading downhill towards Rochdale town centre when the crash happened on a bend. Gritting trucks have been out in force across Greater Manchester overnight after temperatures plummeted below zero and caused ice to form. The lorry could be seen on its side this morning and grit was strewn across the pavement next to the smashed up garden wall of a house. Rochdale council say the truck belongs to its contractor Balfour Beatty, who grit the roads on behalf of the council, and the driver is an employee of the firm. A Rochdale Council spokesman said: 'We're very sorry to hear of the accident and our thoughts at the moment are with the driver and his family. We send our best to him.

"A hospital boss embroiled in a cancer waiting time scandal was accused last night of  bullying staff. Gordon Coutts, chief executive of the trust running Colchester General Hospital, was said to have presided over a culture obsessed with government targets. His personal assistant Mandy Tapfield quit last month after 28 years at the hospital, claiming her ‘life was made hell’. Mandy Tapfield (left) worked at Colchester General Hospital for 28 years and was a PA for Gordon Coutts (right), the chief executive of the trust which ran it. She quit last month after her 'life was made hell' by Coutts . The 56-year-old, who was his executive PA until last month, claims she left because she could no longer tolerate Dr Coutts’s demands. Her husband Paul, 59, says she has reported the alleged bullying to health watchdog Monitor. ‘My wife had worked at the hospital for the past 28 years – for the past two years for Gordon Coutts,’ he said. ‘That guy made my wife’s life hell. His expectancy was that she would run his life for him and arrange everything. ‘He degraded her, he ran her down all the time. It got to the stage where he was telling her what time she had to go for her lunch.' He said his wife contacted health union Unison and human resources before quitting last month. The mother of two has now taken a job in Lincolnshire. Mr Tapfield criticised Dr Coutts for claiming he would not tolerate bullying by staff: ‘It is him that is the bully, and that comes from the top downwards. There is a cultural problem without a doubt. It can only come from the top.’ Police are examining a report by the Care Quality Commission saying officials were fiddling figures to make it seem the hospital was meeting guidelines for treating cancer patients. Thousands of patients may have been affected. It has published claims that staff have been ‘pressured or bullied’ by managers to change cancer waiting times – potentially putting lives at risk. Dr Coutts – in charge of the trust since 2010 and on £165,000 a year – held a widely discredited internal inquiry into the data fiddling claims in 2012. He has also said the hospital ‘cannot accept and does not accept any kind of bullying’. The allegations however include that: . He sits on a board set up by Sir David last year as a centre of excellence for managers to develop ‘outstanding leadership in health’. Colchester General Hospital is being investigated by police following a Care Quality Commission report saying officials were fiddling figures . Karen Webb, a regional director for the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘For the last two or three years, Colchester has been a flashing red light on my dashboard. ‘We have been raising concerns over the culture of bullying at the hospital since 2011 – we have dealt with dozens of complaints from our nurses.’ Mrs Webb said it was easy to see how staff may have felt bullied or under pressure to change data, adding: ‘It is bullying, it is oppressive. It is about don’t speak up, don’t say anything, keep your head down and get on with it.’ She said she experienced such ‘intimidation’ first hand when Dr Coutts swore at her during a private meeting and told her twice to ‘shut up’, after she suggested cleaning cuts could be linked to a rise in the superbug Clostridium difficile. Colchester Hospital University NHS foundation trust was under pressure to meet targets after being fined £16,000 in March last year. North East Essex primary care trust penalised it for missing the 62-day deadline for two patients to receive initial treatment and a delayed consultation for a woman with ‘breast symptoms’. In a letter to a colleague last week, a consultant at the hospital wrote: ‘The pressure on staff in the hospital has been absolutely awful over the last 2 years at all levels of the organisation’. He also spoke of doctors ‘being badgered about cancer breaches by clerks in the cancer coding department’. However, he accused the CQC of mounting a witch hunt against the trust. A trust spokesman would not comment on the allegations that waiting times were fiddled because an independent investigation is underway. And he said discussing Mrs Tapfield would be a ‘breach of confidentiality’. But he said Dr Coutts had not told Mrs Webb to shut up. The trust insists that targets were not put ahead of patient safety. Dr Coutts worked as a junior doctor before becoming an executive in the pharmaceutical industry and then returning to the NHS. Health chiefs at Colchester Hospital repeatedly ignored allegations made by staff and patients that cancer waiting times were being manipulated. At least six employees contacted senior managers or board members to complain about the practice since December 2011, but no action was taken. Gordon Coutts, the chief executive, was even contacted directly by a patient as early as March 2011. It is believed the trust’s most senior executives missed at least three major opportunities to take action, potentially putting lives at risk. These were: . March 2011: Patient John Campbell contacted Dr Coutts in 2011 after a nurse told him openly in front of other patients that she had heard records were being altered. But rather than act on the information, the chief executive sent an astonishing reply saying he would only investigate if the patient had evidence of wrongdoing. IT manager Mr Campbell said he waited more than four months for surgery to have part of his prostate removed, after a blood test indicated he could have cancer. When he asked a nurse why there had been a delay, he was stunned by her response. ‘The nurse said she was very sorry and said the rumour was waiting lists were being manipulated,’ he said. ‘She said the rumour was they were removing people from the waiting list and putting them back on again with new dates so their wait would not seem too long. I couldn’t believe it.’ Mr Campbell, 52, wrote a letter to Dr Coutts to say he was ‘extremely concerned’ to hear of attempts to ‘manipulate the waiting list system’. The Trust is accused of manipulating waiting times for cancer patients, thousands of which could have been affected (file picture) Yet, rather than launch an immediate investigation, the hospital chief sent a curt reply three weeks later, in April 2011. It said: ‘Your fax implies irregularities in the management of waiting lists. If you would like to provide me with the names or evidence or waiting list irregularities I will investigate this further. 'The trust does not support or tolerate any manipulation of patient records.’ Mr Campbell’s wife Julie said: ‘He asked for us to get evidence, but that is for him to do. He’s at the hospital, he has the records.’ February 2012: The hospital board failed to act when two female clerical workers alerted senior managers that staff members were being pressured to change data. It prompted a brief investigation by two of Dr Coutts’s most senior executives during which the whistleblowers were not even interviewed and no action was taken. Dr Coutts, 52, has since admitted the internal investigation was ‘inadequate’, but said ‘it did not seem to be as serious at the time as it was’. Spring 2013: Dr Coutts was contacted again when a female member of staff sent him an email to report the manipulation of data and bullying. A source said: ‘It contained a lot of evidence of what was going on and was not a short email. Most chief executives would have made it their duty to immediately investigate it and speak to the person who reported it. 'Instead, they received a one-line email which said a board member would look into it. They never heard back.’ Tim Roberts, of the union Unison, said: ‘We understand that junior staff informed board members about the falsification of data and the bullying of staff to keep quiet about it, in both 2012 and 2013. 'We do not accept the trust’s position that the first they heard about it was in August 2013, when it was reported to the Care Quality Commission.’","Mandy Tapfield worked at Colchester General Hospital for 28 years .

"A prominent Al-Qaeda leader has been killed by French and Chadian troops in northern Mali, the President of Chad confirmed yesterday. Abdelhamid Abou Zeid, senior commander in Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), was killed among 40 other Islamist fighters three days ago in the foothills of the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains. A U.S. official said the reports of Abou Zeid's death appear credible and that Washington . would view his death as a serious blow to Al-Qaeda's north Africa wing. Serious blow: Abou Zeid, one of the leaders of  Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), was killed by French and Chadian troops in the mountains in northern Mali . Speaking on Friday, Chadian President . Idriss Deby said his forces 'killed two jihadi leaders, including Abou . Zeid,' but did not give any further details. Algerian national Abdelhamid Abou Zeid, whose real name was Mohamed Ghadir, was one of the top three commanders in AQIM. The former smuggler turned jihadist is . believed to be behind the kidnapping of more than 20 Westerners in the area over the last five years, and is thought have executed British national Edwin Dyer in 2009. French and Chadian troops have been hunting AQIM fighters in the mountains on the border to Algeria after a lightning campaign to dislodge them from northern Mali. France's Elysee presidential palace has declined to comment on the AQIM leader, but a French army official confirmed that about 40 Islamists had been killed in heavy fighting over the last week in the mountainous Tigargara region. Fatal battle: The French President Frncois Hollande confirmed today that Abou Zeid, pictured, was 'definitely confirmed' Alleged murder: Abou Zeid is said to have been the one to execute British hostage Edwin Dyer in 2009 . The official said 1,200 French . troops, 800 Chadian soldiers and some elements of the Malian army were . still in combat to the south of Tessalit in the Adrar mountain range. Ten logistics sites and an explosives factory had been destroyed in the operation as well as 16 vehicles, she said. France launched the assault to retake Mali's vast desert north from AQIM and other Islamist rebels after a plea from Mali's government to halt the militants' drive southward. The intervention swiftly dislodged rebels from northern Mali's main towns and drove them back into the surrounding desert and mountains, particularly the Adrar des Ifoghas. After a loose alliance of Islamist . groups seized northern Mali from April last year, Abou Zeid took control . of the ancient desert trading town of Timbuktu, employing a violently . extreme form of sharia, including amputations and the destruction of . ancient Sufi shrines. Confirmed: Abou Zeid was among 40 militants killed last month in the foothills of the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains . Timbuktu . elders who dealt directly with him during the Islamist occupation . described a short man with a grey beard and a quiet, severe manner who . was never seen without an AK-47 rifle. Locals . said that when he fled Timbuktu, before the town fell to the French-led . military advance, he took several blindfolded Western hostages in his . convoy. Born in 1965 in the Debdab region of Algeria's Illizi province, close to the Libyan border, Abou Zeid joined the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) during the 1990s civil war, which later transformed itself into AQIM. Abou Zeid is regarded by some as one of AQIM's radicals, unwilling to negotiate or make concessions. Canadian diplomat Robert Fowler, in an . account of his kidnapping by another Islamist cell in the Sahara, . recounted how Abou Zeid refused to give medication to two hostages . suffering from dysentery, one of whom had been stung by a scorpion. Abou Zeid is reported to have a strong rivalry with Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the mastermind of the mass hostage taking at the In Amenas gas plant in Algeria last month, due to the latter's decision to found his own brigade last year.","Al-Qaeda leader among 40 militants killed in north Mali .

"It has been less than 24 hours since Monica Lewinsky stepped back into the spotlight for the first time in 13 years and told a conference that she 'fell in love with her boss'. But for Bill and Hillary Clinton it was business as usual as they continued on the campaign trail of Democratic candidates ahead of the mid-term elections - and seemingly ignored the comments by the former White House intern. The couple were hundreds of miles apart. The former President was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, backing Senator Mary Landrieu while his wife was in California, attending fundraisers in San Francisco and Los Angeles alongside the likes of Cameron Diaz. Neither mentioned the  affair that took place 15 years ago or the comeback of the 41-year-old who signed up to Twitter for the first time on Monday, hours before her teary-eyed speech at a Forbes conference in Philadelphia. Business as usual: Bill and Hillary Clinton ignored the comments from Monica Lewinsky during appearances in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (left) and San Francisco (right) Clinton described Landrieu as one of the Senate's most bipartisan and effective lawmakers, offering a high-profile campaign boost Monday to the incumbent ahead of the start of the state's early voting period. After the high-profile backing, he then had time to pose for a number of selfies with members of the audience. Clinton sought to combat GOP claims that Landrieu was too closely tied to Democratic leadership in Washington and didn't represent her home state's values. 'This is not a close question of who would do the best job. She should be winning this race,' Clinton told a packed hotel ballroom of 1,500 attendees. The three-term senator faces a tough re-election bid, targeted for ouster by Republicans nationally in their effort to regain Senate control. Landrieu's main GOP opponent is U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy. Landrieu's campaign hopes Clinton's star power and continued popularity help sway undecided voters and bolsters minority turnout in the November 4 election. Early voting begins Tuesday. Cassidy and Republican leaders repeatedly link Landrieu to President Barack Obama, who is unpopular in Louisiana, suggesting a vote to return Landrieu to Washington is like voting for Obama. Landrieu has tried to distance herself from the president, saying the election is about the future of Louisiana. Re-emergence: The former White House intern told the Forbes Under 30 Summit at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia that she 'fell in love with her boss' Cheerful: The former President couldn't help but smile as he stood at the podium in Louisiana and backed incumbent Senator Mary Landrieu . Serious: The former Secretary of State speaks at a fundraiser for Democratic congressional candidates hosted by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco . Hug: She was embraced by the former speaker during the event which raised over $1million for the Democrats . Star appearance: Cameron Diaz was one of the representatives fro  Hollywood who attended the second fundraiser of the evening at  the Tavern restaurant in Los Angeles . No ring: She was spotted with an engagement ring on. Rumors had circulated earlier this month that she had gotten engaged to Benji Madden . Fashionable departure: Eva Longoria was also spotted leaving the event at the Tavern Restaurant . Cassidy's campaign didn't comment on Clinton's appearance in Baton Rouge, while the Republican National Committee discarded it, saying Landrieu was no longer a 'Clinton Democrat.' 'Landrieu's rock solid support for President Obama shows that his agenda is her agenda, and Louisiana voters can see through today's misdirection,' RNC spokesman Ben Voelkel said in a statement. Clinton largely steered clear of talk about the Obama administration, instead describing Landrieu's work to get Louisiana a greater share of offshore oil drilling royalties and her chairmanship of the Senate energy committee. This is Clinton's second visit to Louisiana for Landrieu. He's a popular draw on the campaign trail for vulnerable Democrats across the South, attending events in Arkansas on Sunday and planning a rally in Kentucky on Tuesday. As he waded through the crowds, Mr Clinton stopped to pose for a selfie with an audience member . Popular: The former President is mobbed by audience members holding up their phones and tablets to take pictures at the campaign event . 'I feel like an old race horse, and I'm retired up here in this stable, you know. And all of a sudden at election time, they come and bring me an extra bale of hay and then they put the reins on, take me out to the track, slap me on the rear and see if I can make it around just one more time,' he joked. Louisiana's Senate race is unlikely to be decided in two weeks. If no candidate in the eight-person field gets more than 50 percent of the vote, the race will be settled in a December 6 runoff. Polls show Cassidy with a slight lead in runoff scenarios. The former First Lady started her day of campaigning in San Francisco. She urged Democratic voters not to be complacent about the November midterm elections, saying working women and their families will lose out on a better future if Republicans gain control of both houses of Congress. According to ABC San Francisco she made the remarks during a sold-out women’s luncheon hosted by House Democratic Leader and former speaker Nancy Pelosi that raised $1.4 million for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Backing: Mr Clinton described Landrieu as one of the Senate's most bipartisan and effective lawmakers, offering a high-profile boost to the incumbent ahead of the start of the state's early voting period . By the time Lewinsky concluded her emotional presentation on the perils of public humiliation in the digital age, the Twitter-sphere was abuzz with excitement over Lewinsky’s apparent comeback, showering her with praise for her courage. Lewinsky, 41, joined Twitter less than two hours before taking the stage at the Forbes conference, where she was invited to speak about the ‘scourge of harassment in the digital age.’ ‘Overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one. I was Patient Zero, the first person to have their reputation completely destroyed worldwide via the Internet,’ Ms Lewinsky told a rapt crowd in a room where, according to multiple eyewitness accounts shared on Twitter, one could hear a pin drop. Lewinsky, best known worldwide for her sordid affair with President Bill Clinton, did not mince words when addressing that part of her biography. ‘Sixteen years ago, fresh out of college...I fell in love with my boss,’ Lewinsky declared from the stage in Philadelphia, before launching into an impassioned speech about the price she had been forced to pay for her youthful indiscretion.","Pair attended fundraisers in hundreds of miles apart in Baton Rouge and San Francisco .

"Jurors in the trial of Jodi Arias, charged in the stabbing and shooting death of her lover, watched a videotaped interrogation of the suspect Wednesday during which she insists she didn't him, but says if she had, she would have killed him quickly and humanely. Arias is charged with murder in the June 2008 death of her on-again-off-again boyfriend Travis Alexander. If convicted, she could get the death penalty, becoming just the fourth woman on Arizona's death row. On trial: Jodi Arias is charged with murder in the June 2008 death of her on-again-off-again boyfriend Travis Alexander . Heavy penalty: If convicted, Arias could get the death penalty, becoming just the fourth woman on Arizona's death row . Authorities say she stabbed and slashed Alexander nearly 30 times, slitting his throat from ear to ear, and shot him in the head around June 4, 2008, at his Mesa home. His body was found five days later in his shower. She first told police she knew nothing of the killing. Later she said two intruders burst into the home and killed him while she managed to escape. She now admits to the killing, but claims she had to defend herself against an enraged and abusive Alexander. Jurors on Wednesday watched a videotaped interrogation of Arias, 32, after her arrest. A detective grilled Arias, explaining that all the evidence points to her. She insisted she did not kill him. Mesa police detective Esteban Flores continued to press her on the tape. ‘You shot him in the head, then you got a knife and you stabbed him,’ Flores said. ‘Jodi, tell me the truth, please.’ Doomed: Jodi Arias pictured with Travis Alexander, the ex-boyfriend that she is accused of stabbing 27 times after her tried to end their relationship . ‘I did not kill Travis,’ Arias replied. However, she said if she were to have killed him, she couldn't have stabbed him. It would have been too cruel. ‘I don't think I could stab him. I think I would have to shoot him until he was dead if that were my intentions,’ Arias told the detective. ‘But I would have to wear gloves. ‘If I had it in me to kill him, the least I could have done was make it as humane as possible,’ she added. Jurors in the murder trial asked questions suggesting they had doubts about the . investigation into the murder of Alexander, ABC News reported. The jury submitted several handwritten questions to Judge Sherry . Stephens after the testimony of Detective Esteban Flores of the Mesa, . Arizona, police department. Some read: . 'When interviewing Mr. Alexander's roommates, did they ever show concern for his extended absence?' 'Did you ever check into their alibis?' Authorities say Alexander was shot in the head with a .25-caliber handgun, the same caliber gun Arias and her grandparents reported stolen from their Northern California home about a week before the killing. Arias was staying with them at the time. Authorities say they found sexual photographs in a camera inside Alexander's home that place Arias there on the day he was killed. Crime scene: Photographs shown in the murder trial of Jodi Arias show the crime scene at Travis Alexander's home in Mesa, California after his body was found . Bloodied: Investigators described the 2008 crime scene as among the most gruesome they'd ever seen . The photos, displayed for jurors this week during her trial in Phoenix, show Arias nude in Alexander's home, Alexander alive in the shower, then his dead body in the bathroom. Police say the photos are time-stamped on the day he was killed. Detectives say Arias' bloody palm print and hair also were found at the scene. None of the weapons used in the killing has been recovered. Prosecutors say Arias came prepared to kill the 30-year-old devout Mormon, businessman and motivational speaker, and neglected to call police after leaving behind a crime scene that investigators described as among the most gruesome they'd ever seen. They say she attacked him in a jealous rage after he broke up with her. She says she broke up with him after about five months of dating, but the two continued to see each other sexually. Arias' attorney, Jennifer Willmott, told jurors in opening statements that Alexander ‘lunged at Jodi in anger’ on the day he was killed, and she had to defend herself. The trial resumes Thursday and is expected to last until April.

"Mohammad Ajmal Choudhry was arrested for plotting a murder in Pakistan (file photo) A New York man has been charged with conspiring to commit the 'honor killings' of a family in Pakistan, the Department of Justice announced today. Mohammad Ajmal Choudhry, of Brooklyn, was plotting to murder the family members of a man he believed had helped his daughter escape from Pakistan to America, U.S. authorities claim. Choudhry, 60, was arraigned today on charges he conspired to murder in a foreign country, transmitted threats via interstate communications and committed visa fraud. His next scheduled court appearance is Thursday in Brooklyn. According to federal prosecutors, Choudhry’s daughter, Amina Ajmal, was held against her will in Pakistan for more than three years by relatives at her father's orders. During her captivity, Ajmal, an American citizen, was forced into an arranged marriage with a Pakistani national for the purpose of obtaining a U.S. visa for that individual, authorities said. Ajmal managed to eventually flee Pakistan and return to the U.S. with the help of a cousin and State Department officials. Prosecutors say Choudhry, who did not know his daughter's whereabouts, threatened her in recorded telephone calls, saying he would plan the murder of her cousin if she did not return to the family's Brooklyn home. After his daughter's refusal to return home, her cousin's father and sister were shot and killed in Pakistan on Feb. 25, according to U.S. officials. Witnesses reported seeing Choudhry’s brother standing over the bodies with a gun. Agents from HSI and the Diplomatic Security Service placed 60-year-old Choudhry under arrest in Brooklyn later that same day. 'As alleged, the defendant viewed his daughter as a commodity to be bartered. 'When she escaped those holding her overseas and fled to safety in the U.S., the defendant enlisted his confederates to retaliate against those who had helped her to freedom. 'As a result of his plot, two innocent people were murdered in Pakistan,' U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a press release Wednesday. 'We are committed to ensuring that people in the United States who export murder abroad will be brought to justice.'","Mohammed Ajmal Choudhry charged with conspiracy to murder in a foreign country and commit visa fraud .

"Britain could be stuck with Abu Qatada for life after judges put the fanatic’s human rights ahead of protecting the public – even though they accepted he was ‘very dangerous’. The judges said that while Qatada’s deportation was ‘long overdue’, his risk to the public was not ‘a relevant consideration’ under human rights laws. The verdict drew a furious response from the Tories and sparked new demands for the Government to ignore the courts and simply throw him out of the country. The UK government launched the appeal after the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) ruled that Abu Qatada should not be deported to Jordan where he was convicted of terror charges in his absence in 1999 . The Appeal Court yesterday upheld an . earlier verdict that sending the hate preacher to face a terror trial in . Jordan would not be fair. Home Secretary Theresa May will now . lodge a last-ditch appeal to the Supreme Court. If that fails, it would . raise the prospect of Qatada – variously described as a ‘truly dangerous . individual’ and Osama bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe – never . being deported. He could apply to be freed within days. Qatada – described by Mrs May’s legal . team as ‘truly dangerous’ – has now defied the wishes of six Labour and . Tory home secretaries over eight years. Yesterday Justice Secretary Chris . Grayling said: ‘Labour and the Liberal Democrats’ refusal to contemplate . big changes to human rights law is inexplicable given problems like . this. I am bitterly unhappy that we have to wait until the next general . election to sort this out.’ But there was also stinging criticism of the Coalition’s failure to boot Qatada out. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper . said Mrs May’s strategy of pursuing the case through the British courts . rather than in Europe had backfired disastrously, adding: ‘This is an . extremely serious and disappointing judgment.’ Qatada was once described as Osama Bin Laden¿s right-hand man in Europe . and even the judges in the Court of Appeal admit he is regarded as a 'very dangerous' man . Ministers have been trying for a . decade to send Qatada to Jordan, where he is accused of plotting a . terrorist atrocity to coincide with the Millennium. His removal was originally approved . by the British courts, only to be halted by the European Court of Human . Rights last year. Judges in Strasbourg said he would not get a fair . trial because some of the evidence used against him may have been . obtained by torture. Controversially, Mrs May opted not to appeal . against this verdict. Home Secretary Theresa May has branded Qatada a 'dangerous man' but repeatedly failed in her promise to put him on a plane . Instead, she and her ministers . secured personal promises from the Jordanian authorities there would be . no use of torture evidence, and began the deportation process again in . the UK legal system. But last November, the Special . Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) said it was not satisfied with the . assurances, and halted Qatada’s removal. The court said it must reflect . the Strasbourg ruling. That decision was yesterday unanimously upheld by Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls, and two other Appeal Court judges. Lord Dyson, sitting with Lord Justice . Richards and Lord Justice Elias, said Qatada was ‘considered to be a . dangerous and controversial person’. He added: ‘It is entirely . understandable that there is a general feeling that his deportation to . Jordan to face trial is long overdue. But the principles that we have to . apply do not distinguish between extremely dangerous persons and others . who may not constitute any danger in the UK and whom the Secretary of . State wishes to deport to face trial in another country. ‘The fact that (Qatada) is considered . to be a dangerous terrorist is not relevant to the issues that are . raised on this appeal.’ Tory MPs have repeatedly urged Mrs May to ignore the courts and throw Qatada out. But that would mean taking the unprecedented step of defying judges in both Europe and Britain. Last night, there was growing unrest among Tories at the failure to get rid of the cleric. Backbencher Dominic Raab said: ‘The . Government made a strategic mistake in the way it argued this case. There is nothing in the European Convention or UK law that says we have . to guarantee fair trials at the other end when we deport foreign . criminals or terrorists. ‘If we had made clear that we . rejected Strasbourg’s ruling – and meddling – on principle at the . outset, the UK Border Agency could have deported Qatada without the UK . courts stopping them.’ Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said the 'farcical situation' must not be repeated and shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the government's strategy for dealing with Qatada had been 'ripped apart' Qatada is in Belmarsh high-security jail for allegedly breaching his immigration bail conditions. Police are investigating whether he . posted extremist propaganda on the internet while his every move was . supposedly monitored by security officials. Anti-terror police raided . his home after finding fresh jihadi articles on the internet. If charges are brought, it would mean . Qatada standing trial in Britain for the first time, which could itself . halt deportation proceedings. The worst-case scenario for the Home . Office is that police take no further action and Qatada is once again . granted bail. He is shortly due to go before Siac to ask for his . release. The court has granted him bail on two previous occasions. If freed, Qatada would go back under round-the-clock surveillance estimated to cost £100,000 a week, or £5million a year. Qatada sits in a car as he is driven away from a Special Immigration Appeals Hearing at the High Court in London in April last year after being re-arrested . Should the Home Office’s appeal . against yesterday’s verdict be refused, and no charges are brought, . there would no longer be any grounds for holding him in jail or under . effective house arrest. Instead, he would be placed on a . so-called T-Pim - a terror control order that would restrict his . movements and use of the internet, while leaving him free to walk the . streets for up to 12 hours a day. T-Pims normally only last two years, raising the prospect of Qatada being free by mid-2015. The alternative is for Mrs May to try . to get yet more assurances from Jordan and seek permission to restart . the deportation process. Qatada has been linked to a long list of . international terrorists. He featured in hate sermons found on videos in . the flat of one of the September 11 bombers. In April 1999, he was convicted in . his absence on terror charges in Jordan and sentenced to life . imprisonment. It is on these charges that he faces a retrial. Last night, the Home Office said: ‘This is not the end of the road. The Government remains determined to deport Abu Qatada.’ JAMES SLACK'S ANALYSIS . Gamble: Home Secretary Theresa May had hoped assurances from Jordan would be enough to secure Abu Qatada's deportation . For a politician with a reputation built on being a safe pair of hands, Theresa May has shown a surprising appetite for high-stakes gambles in recent months. In the case of Gary McKinnon, she achieved spectacular success. The gamble she took on Abu Qatada, however, now looks like it is going to backfire. In both cases, Mrs May was banking on a favourable diplomatic response from a foreign power – Jordan, in Qatada’s case, and America for Mr McKinnon. A succession of craven Labour home secretaries had been prepared to bundle Asperger’s sufferer Mr McKinnon on to a plane on hacking charges rather than risk upsetting the US. Mrs May courageously stood up to the Americans, saved Mr McKinnon from potential suicide and suffered no meaningful damage to relations with her counterparts in the Obama administration. She has also been prepared to gamble over the future of the UK Border Agency, which she announced was being split in two earlier this week. The organisation is an incompetent shambles and she decided it was beyond saving. Which brings us to the Abu Qatada nightmare. It dates back to this time last year, when the European Court of Human Rights delivered its long-awaited verdict on whether the hate-filled fanatic could be sent to face terror charges in Jordan. The court accepted there would be no risk of Qatada himself being ill-treated (a very important finding). But the judges stopped his removal on the highly contentious grounds that some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture, denying him a fair trial. This argument had already been rejected by Britain’s own Law Lords. So Mrs May had a choice. She could appeal the Strasbourg ruling, which could have led to the court re-examining the case and possibly changing its verdict that Qatada himself faced no danger. Or she could seek reassurances from Jordan no torture evidence would be used in court, and start the deportation all over again in Britain, on this narrow point of law. She went for the second option, staking her credibility on assurances from the Jordanians. It didn’t work. First the Siac immigration court said it wasn’t happy with the undertakings Mrs May had secured and blocked Qatada’s removal. Now that decision has been rubber-stamped by the Appeal Court. Labour – and some Tories – are attacking Mrs May’s strategy and Qatada and his lawyers are laughing at the Government. Mrs May has not given up, and will appeal to the Supreme Court. Doubtless her determination to withdraw Britain from the clutches of the European Court of Human Rights has been strengthened. But, at the moment, it is Qatada holding all the aces in a game Mrs May – and this country – really cannot afford to lose.","Court of Appeal rejects latest attempt by Home Secretary to have Qatada sent back to Jordan .

"It is a day when most parents consider attendance sacrosanct, but Tom Cruise has been forced to explain why he was absent from his daughter Suri's first day of school. Cruise has been questioned about his role as a father as part of a $50million legal process which has seen the Hollywood superstar sue a magazine company for defaming his parenting skills. The 51-year-old defended himself during a deposition, claiming he would have been there for Suri's first day of school had she asked him to be. Daddy's girl: Tom Cruise, pictured with Suri last year, claims he would have been there for his daughter's first day of school had she asked him . The revelations comes one the same day as Katie Holmes is accused of 'smearing' Tom Cruise in a series of leaked emails sent between his staff. The emails, sent last autumn, sees Tom's publicist Amanda Lundberg accuse Holmes friend and business partner Jeanne Yang of leaking untrue information to journalists during a conversation with other members of Tom Cruise's staff. The conversation, obtained by Radar Online, also alleges that Katie Holmes press team work to ensure Suri and Katie are pictured together as often as possible. '[Katie's publicist] calls the paparazzi every time K gets ready to leave the building as the doormen are always surprised how they suddenly show up when she is about to leave,' Lundberg writes to another employed. Cruise is suing Bauer Publishing for . their 2012 cover stories of both Life & Style and In Touch that . claimed he had 'abandoned' his daughter Suri after divorcing Holmes on . 29 June 2012. School girls: Suri is pictured being dropped off at her $40,000-a-year private school in Chelsea, Manhattan by her mother Katie Holmes, 34, late last month . 'Not an ideal situation': Tom Cruise is suing Life & Style and InTouch for claiming in two cover stories that he had 'abandoned' his daughter Suri . ‘I think parents sometimes think it’s (a big day),’ Cruise said of his daughter’s first day at a New York private school. ‘You . know with Suri, if she had asked me to be there, I would have been . there. I would have tried to make it work out in any way I could.’ He . added that he had agreed with his ex-wife Katie Holmes that it would be . best if he did not attend, so as to avoid a media circus. Suri attends a $40,000-a-year school near the apartment in Chelsea, Manhattan, where she lives with her mother. The revelations comes from a 48-page transcript of a gruelling deposition held in September this year, obtained by Radar, in which Cruise admits he did not see his daughter Suri for 110 days after his divorce. Radar reports how when asked if his former wife Holmes, 34, had tried to 'protect' Suri from Scientology, Cruise hit back. In happier times: Tom and Kate are seen doting over their daughter Suri in New York in 2008 during Katie's rehearsals for the Broadway play All My Sons . 'Listen, I find that question . offensive,' he is quoted as saying. 'I find it, those statements . offensive. Like with any relationship, there are many different levels . to it. You know, I, I find it very offensive. There is no need to . protect my daughter from my religion.' Cruise was then asked if Scientology . was on of the reasons Holmes left him, to which he appeared to admit, . replying: 'Did she say that? That was one of the assertions, yes.' The actor also confirmed that seven-year-old Suri is not longer practising Scientology. He was then asked if this meant Holmes would be considered a 'Suppressive Person' - a Scientology term used to describe members of the controversial religion who publicly renounce their faith. 'That is a distortion and a simplification of the matter,' he is said to have replied. '...I don’t want to just give an oversimplification of religious doctrine.' The site report that an 'angry' Cruise began to explain 'when there is a divorce... things change' at the interrogation held at the LA offices of Cruise's lawyer. In the document, McNamara probes Tom: 'From June 18 of 2012 until Thanksgiving of 2012, you only say Suri a few times, isn’t that right?,' to which Cruise replies, 'yes'. Deposition: Radar report that an 'angry' Cruise began to explain 'when there is a divorce... things change' at the interrogation held at the LA offices of Cruise's lawyer. McNamara then continues to calculate . the time that Cruise spent with his daughter Suri following his divorce . with Holmes, which totalled 10 days. Cruise then offers that during that time he was able to remain in Suri's life through conversations on the telephone. 'I’ve gotten very good at it. I’ve gotten very good at it. I tell wonderful stories and they like hearing it.' But McNamara replied, 'It really doesn’t substitute for being able to be there does it?' 'No, it doesn’t,' Cruise replied.

"A greedy bee who flew headfirst into a flower looks like he could be a robot in disguise - after pulling off a near-perfect impression of his namesake from the multi-billion dollar Transformers franchise. The podgy bee was caught on camera looking just like the robot Bumblebee from the Hollywood series - as he raises his front legs in a bid to stand up, covered in bright yellow pollen. Amateur photographer Kutub Uddin, 27, captured the moment on camera in Hotham Park, Bognor Regis, West Sussex. Kutub Uddin had been trying to capture the perfect close up picture of a bumblebee and finally got this snap . Covered in pollen, the bee, left, looks more like its namesake in the Transformers franchise, right . Mr Uddin, who works as a chef, had been trying to capture a perfect close-up shot of a bumblebee and, after being stung by wasps several times, finally managed to capture this moment. He said: 'This was a particularly big bee, and he'd been drinking a lot of pollen. 'He was covered in it so much that he was struggling to fly away, so I moved in to take a picture. 'He obviously wasn't happy about me getting too close though, so raised up on his back legs to try to protect his pollen. 'I knew that was the moment I needed to capture. The bee was particularly large and reared up to protect its pollen when Mr Uddin edged too close . 'I love taking close shots of bees and wasps by going very close to them slowly. This takes a lot of patience as a decent shot can take up to several hours. 'I enjoy insects and animals so I wasn't scared to go up close to them, however a couple of time I did get bitten by wasps which wasn't very pleasant.

"Henrietta Offae was caught sleeping on duty at an old folks care home and will serve an 18 month jail sentence . A care worker caught sleeping while on duty at an old folk’s home may face deportation after serving an 18 month jail sentence. Ghanaian-born Henrietta Offae disabled alarm systems and doubled up incontinence pads for elderly care home residents so she could sleep on her night shift. The 42-year-old was caught sound asleep in front of the television in the middle of the night by two of her bosses who had become suspicious. After being convicted on all 19 counts of neglect of an elderly or infirm person - one for each resident of the home - it emerged she had already admitted identity fraud for using someone else’s passport. Judge Francis Sheridan said: 'Having cheated her way into employment, she cheated her way through employment.' He told Offae: 'Your conduct was a disgrace. It was cruel, it was unacceptable.' Offae is appealing a UK Border Agency decision to deny her leave to remain in Britain and may now be deported by virtue of the 18-month prison sentence she received. Through a first trial and then a retrial, the defendant maintained that she had not been asleep in the way her bosses - the home’s manager Salina Ballard and team leader Barbara May - had maintained. The care worker claimed she had just been 'resting her eyes', despite the managers taking turns to watch her for some time while the other checked on residents. But the judge said that events in the early morning of August 18, 2011, were not a one-off but showed the 'modus operandi' which Offae had used on a number of occasions. Other staff members from Westlands care home in Olney, near Milton Keynes, told how shift-worker Offae put two pads on residents on another occasion to reduce the need to change them. She told a colleague it was what she had done in a previous job. Investigators also found alarmed fall mats beside the beds had been disconnected but made to look intact. Other measures had been taken to reduce the need to check on or deal with the 19 residents - who were aged between 75 and 100 and suffering from health problems including dementia and incontinence. Care home bosses contacted the police and also referred themselves to the care industry watchdog. Relatives . of the patients praised the home and its other staff for the . outstanding service provided and for the bravery shown in alerting the . authorities. Judge Sheridan presided over Offae’s trial at Aylesbury Crown Court, sitting in Amersham, Buckinghamshire. The defendant was working at Westlands Care Home in Olney at the time. She used someone else's passport to get a job . Prosecutor Christopher Amis then told him of the passport fraud, in which Offae had admitted a charge of possessing false identity documents. He said: 'The defendant was employed by Heritage Care company at Swan House on April 22, 2010, after she had submitted an application in the name of Mabel Mensah. 'She had provided a genuine Belgian passport in that name and had provided a Lloyds Bank printout in that name, an NHS card in that name and an energy bill in that name. 'The court knows she’s an illegal immigrant but Swan House did a criminal records bureau check on that name and that showed no entries.' He said after the investigation into . her activities at Westlands had begun, police visited Swan House, . Winslow, to probe the circumstances of her work there and inform staff . that she was not who she had claimed to be. Steven . Gray, defending, said in mitigation that his client had left Ghana for a . better life in the UK in 2001 after years of struggling to cope . following the murders of her shopkeeper parents in an armed robbery in . the mid 1990s. Colleagues said that she would double up on the residents' incontinence pads so that she would not have to change them as often . She met a Ghanaian man with whom she has had two children - both born in the UK - and with whom she was still living before being jailed. He has also applied for indefinite leave to remain in Britain and is waiting for a response. 'It was really through a desire to get work and support the young family that she made the foolish decision to do so with a passport that was not her own,' said Mr Gray. 'It was given to her by someone in the community to help her survive.' He said the passport with which she entered Britain was seized by the border authorities, although he could not say what passport that was. Of her neglect of the residents, Mr Gray added: 'This is indicative of laziness and tiredness, rather than a wish to be physically cruel to residents. That’s a very great distinction. 'It is a case about a failure to act, a failure to provide care which ought to be provided.' Responding to pleas for leniency for the sake of the children, Judge Sheridan told Mr Gray: “I don’t sentence the children. She does, by her actions. 'The fact that you have got children does not mean the judge should not do justice to the victims.' He told Offae: 'You were their protector on that night shift and you were nothing like their protector. 'You were lazy. You were a cheat. Your criminality was consistent and sustained neglect. 'The sentence is one of imprisonment. It must be, to deter others who want to cheat their employers and cheat on residents to ensure a quiet night. 'The elderly must have protection and the court must make it clear. If you are charged to look after them and you don’t you will face imprisonment.' He sentenced her to 19 concurrent sentences of 13 months in jail, to be served consecutively with a five-month term for the passport offence. The judge said he believed Offae should be barred from ever working with the elderly in a care home or hospital again. Chris Ryan, general manager of St Andrews Care Homes, which owns Westlands, said afterwards: 'It has been a pretty horrible situation that has gone on for quite a long time and for the residents and families to have gone through that, so we are satisfied to have got the conclusion we wanted. 'We are angry that somebody would do this to our residents. People who work in care do so because they are supposedly caring people. Clearly she wasn’t.' Maggie Tolliday, whose 91-year-old mother Iris was one of the 19 residents, said: 'It has been very difficult and you’re almost relieved that they (the residents) could not remember what was going on.' She praised what she described as 'a very, very good, caring home' for taking a huge risk in raising the issue, possibly jeopardising its reputation. 'I’m just glad that Offae got what she deserved and I don’t want to see her anywhere near any vulnerable people ever again,' she added.","Henrietta Offae was convicted of neglect and will serve an 18-months in jail .

"Neon Roberts spent Christmas Day without his mother because of the bitter family rift caused by her battle to stop him receiving radiotherapy. Sally Roberts’s unsuccessful eight-week legal bid had put her in conflict with her estranged husband Ben, who told her that she would not be welcome at the family gathering. It is the first time Sally has been parted from Neon and his twin sister Electra at Christmas – and last night, her brother Tony Leese said: ‘It could be Neon’s last Christmas, it’s such a shame. Together: Sally Roberts spent Christmas away from her son Neon for the first time due to a family rift . ‘I know family feelings are very strong over Sally’s actions, but she’s only doing what any mother would do for their child. It’s wrong Neon should suffer because people are angry at her.’ Ben initially supported Sally’s decision to seek alternative treatment for their seven-year-old son’s brain tumour, but signed a consent for normal medical treatment when he realised time was running out, sparking the court battle. Mr Leese, 48, first feared that his sister might be barred from seeing Neon after he overheard a conversation at the hospital between Ben and Sally. He said: ‘I heard Ben say to Sally, in front of Neon, “If you want to see Neon at all, you won’t behave like this.” Little Neon’s eyes widened in alarm when he heard it.’ Neon is now due to start his radiotherapy on January 10 – and recently underwent a second operation to remove cancerous cells from his brain. ‘Neon’s made a good recovery from the second operation and has really enjoyed his Christmas,’ Mr Leese said. unit: neon with his parents Sally and Ben Roberts who are separated and are understood to have fallen out over her battle to to stop him receiving radiotherapy . ‘I’ve seen a picture of him fooling around wearing false teeth and enormous glasses on Christmas Day. ‘That’s the Neon we all love, he’s really cheeky with a great sense of humour. It’s good to see him back to his normal self. ‘Hopefully he’ll come through it all – that’s up to Neon and the big man in the sky. If the family can bond together and give him our love and support he will stand more of a chance.’ Doctors treating Neon give him what is . termed ‘playtime’, which is time to get used to the radiotherapy . machines and the mask they will make to cover the part of his head which . will not be irradiated. Mr Leese said: ’He’s having what they call ‘playtime’, he went last . Thursday and they started by making a plaster cast of his hand, to get . him used to how it feels. Separated: Sally Roberts' brother Tony said: 'It could be neon's last Christmas. It's such a shame.' ‘He had his furry toy tiger Tallulah with him when he went to the . hospital and they made a special cast for Tallulah, I thought that was . very sweet. ‘Neon’s made a good recovery from the second operation and has really . enjoyed his Christmas.

Mr Leese’s Christmas present to his nephew was a fishing rod, and hopes to take Neon away on a fishing trip, once he has got through . all his radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Mr Leese, of Island Gardens, east London, said: ’I heard from my mum that . Neon was absolutely thrilled by the fishing rod. 'I had told him when he . was in hospital that I was going to give him one. ‘His eyes had widened with delight and a big smile spread across his . face. I told him that we would go on a fishing trip together and he’s . very excited. ‘Neon’s a real nature boy and I think there would be nothing better then . us sitting together on a bank, watching the birds diving into the river . and waiting for a fish to bite. ‘But of course, that’s all between me, Neon and the big man in the . sky......Neon could be snatched from us at any time, we just don’t know. ‘Hopefully he’ll come through it all, if the family can bond together . and give him our love and support he will stand more of a chance.’ Despite finally recognising that Mrs Roberts must give up her court . fight and concentrate on saving Neon, Mr Leese said he is still very proud of . what his sister has achieved. He said: ’Sally has shone a light on the whole subject of radiotherapy . and alternative treatments, even the Judge had sympathy with her views. ‘I’m very proud of what she has done, initially she knew nothing about . medullablastoma in children, now she has learnt everything she can about . it. ‘Who knows, in years to come, some of the therapies that have been . dismissed as just in the experimental stage now, may be used as standard . medical treatments in the future.’ Last night Mrs Roberts declined to comment.","Told by estranged husband she was not welcome at family gathering .

"A two-year-old girl born without a windpipe has become the youngest patient in the world to receive a bio-engineered organ after doctors implanted her with a special tube grown from her own stem cells. Hannah Warren has been unable to breathe, eat, drink or swallow on her own since she was born in South Korea in 2010. Until the April 9 operation at the Children's Hospital of Illinois, the toddler had spent her entire life in a hospital in Seoul. Doctors there told her parents there was no hope and they expected her to die. The stem cells came from Hannah's bone marrow, extracted with a special needle inserted into her hip bone. They were seeded in a lab onto a plastic scaffold, where it took less than a week for them to multiply and create a new windpipe. About the size of a 3-inch tube of penne pasta, it was implanted in a nine-hour procedure. New windpipe: In this April 26, 2013 photo provided by OSF Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria, Ill., Hannah Warren, 2, lies in bed in a post-op room at the Children's Hospital of Illinois in Peoria, after having received a new windpipe . Early signs indicate the windpipe is working, although she is still on a ventilator. They believe she will eventually be able to live at home and lead a normal life. 'We feel like she's reborn,' said Hannah's father, Darryl Warren. 'They hope that she can do everything that a normal child can do but it's going to take time. This is a brand new road that all of us are on.' He added: 'This is her only chance but she's got a fantastic one and an unbelievable one.' Warren choked up and his wife, Lee Young-mi, was teary-eyed at a hospital news conference today. Hannah did not attend because she is still recovering from the surgery. She developed an infection after the operation but now is acting like a healthy two-year-old, her doctors said. Miracle: Hannah Warren, 2, pictured with her parents Lee Young-mi and Darryl Warren at Seoul National University Hospital in Seoul, South Korea, piror to the breakthrough surgery . Warren said he hopes the family can bring Hannah home for the first time in a month or so. Hannah turns three in August. 'It's going to be amazing for us to finally be together as a family of four,' he said. The couple has an older daughter. Only about one in 50,000 children worldwide are born with the windpipe defect. The stem-cell technique has been used to make other body parts besides windpipes and holds promise for treating other birth defects and childhood diseases, her doctors said. The operation brought together an . Italian surgeon based in Sweden who pioneered the technique, a pediatric . surgeon at Children's Hospital of Illinois in Peoria who met Hannah's . family while on a business trip to South Korea, and Hannah — born to a . Newfoundland man and Korean woman who married after he moved to that . country to teach English. Hannah's . parents had read about Dr. Paolo Macchiarini's success using stem-cell . based tracheas but couldn't afford to pay for the operation at his . center, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Breakthrough: Surgeons perform a landmark windpipe transplant operation on Hannah Warren, 2, at Children's Hospital of Illinois in Peoria on April 9, 2013 . So Dr. Mark Holterman . helped the family arrange to have the procedure at his Peoria hospital, . bringing in Macchiarini to lead the operation. Children's Hospital . waived the cost, likely hundreds of thousands of dollars, Holterman . said. Part of OSF Saint Francis Medical Center, the Roman Catholic hospital considers the operation part of their mission to provide charity care, but also views it as a way to champion a type of stem-cell therapy that doesn't involve human embryos, the surgeons said. The Catholic church opposes using stem cells derived from human embryos in research or treatment. Macchiarini has been involved in 14 . previous windpipe operations using patients' own stem cells — five using . man-made scaffolds like Hannah's but in adults; and nine using . scaffolds made from cadaver windpipes, including one in a 10-year-old . British boy. He . said only one patient died, a 30-year-old man from Abingdon, Md., who . had the operation in November 2011 to treat late-stage cancer of the . windpipe. He died about four months later of uncertain causes, . Macchiarini said. Brave: The little girl is recovering with her parents, left, after the nine-hour surgery on April 9 . Similar methods have been used to grow bladders, urethras and last year a girl in Sweden got a lab-made vein using her own stem cells and a cadaver vein. Scientists hope to eventually use the method to create solid organs, including kidneys and livers, said Dr. Anthony Atala, director of Wake Forest University's Institute for Regenerative Medicine. He said the operation on Hannah Warren 'is really showing that the technique is workable.' Hannah had breathing difficulties at birth and Korean doctors soon discovered the missing windpipe. They reconfigured her esophagus so that a breathing tube could go down it from her mouth to her lungs. The esophagus normally runs behind the windpipe and carries food to the stomach. Korean doctors said she couldn't live long with the tube and told her parents there was nothing more they could do. Hannah . outlived their expectations and has thrived despite the grim prognosis . and other abnormalities including an undeveloped voice box that . prevented her from speaking. Tears of joy: Darryl Warren and his wife, Lee Young-mi, tearfully stand on Tuesday April 30, 2013, after being introduced at a press conference in at Children's Hospital of Illinois, in Peoria, Ill. Doctors: Dr. Paolo Macchiarini, center, holds a replica of a windpipe like that implanted in little Hannah at a news conference today . Now that she has a windpipe and can breathe more normally, doctors expect the larynx to grow and function normally. She will work with speech therapists to help her learn to talk. Holterman said Hannah will likely need a new windpipe in about five years, as she grows. She breathes with help from a ventilator but no longer has a tube in her mouth that she'd lived with since shortly after birth, Holterman said. She's not yet able to eat normally, but doctors let her have her first taste ever of food — a few licks on a lollipop. Her father said she already has discriminating taste and prefers chocolate Korean lollipops to the American kind. 'I asked her, ""Is it good?""' he said, 'and she immediately nodded her head.'","Hannah Warren was born without a windpipe in 2010 and has been unable to breathe, eat, drink or swallow on her own since then .

"Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz said it was 'astonishing' that no-one has been charged with FGM in almost 30 years . A major inquiry has been launched into female genital mutilation to ‘get to the truth’ about why no-one has been convicted three decades after it was made illegal. Parliament’s powerful Home Affairs Select Committee is to challenge ministers and the police over why charges have never been brought against ‘cutters’ or families who arrange the surgery. Prosecutors claim they are close to bringing the first FGM court case since the law was changed in 1985. NHS staff, teachers and social workers will also be grilled in Parliament about what more they could do to curb the practice. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘It is astonishing that since FGM was made a crime in 1985 nobody has been prosecuted. ‘This is a concern both to the diaspora communities and also the NHS and it is important that light is cast on this practice and action is taken,’ he told the Evening Standard. ‘That is why this committee is launching an inquiry into FGM. We are keen to hear from any victims and those who have been affected by this practice.’ ‘I am keen to hear from people about their experiences and the committee is prepared to take evidence from anyone so that we can get to the truth.’ The committee’s call for evidence will ask for information about how widespread FGM is and what more could be done to stop it. Last month FGM campaigner Leyla . Hussein was left in tears after an experiment intended to assess the . impact of political correctness on the fight against cutting saw 19 . people sign a fake pro-FGM petition within 30 minutes. The . 32-year-old, who suffered female genital mutilation as a child, . approached shoppers in Northampton with the petition, which argued that . as FGM was part of her culture, it should be protected. During . the 30-minute experiment, 19 people signed the petition and just one . refused - a result Hussein blamed on the all-pervading culture of . political correctness. Also known as female circumcision or simply as 'cutting', female genital mutilation involves removing all or part of the clitoris, the surrounding labia (the outer part of the vagina) and sometimes the sewing up of the vagina, leaving only a small opening for urine and menstrual blood. Leyla Hussein uffered female genital mutilation as a child and now campaigns against it . Miss Hussein approached shoppers in Northampton with a petition in favour of FGM and was shocked to find 19 people signed it . The barbaric tradition has no medical . benefits, and is carried out for cultural reasons, often because it . demonstrates a girl's virginity on her wedding night. In cultures where mutilation is common, 'uncut' girls are considered more likely to be promiscuous, unhygienic, and prone to diseases such as HIV/Aids. Families often club together to fly professional 'cutters' to the UK from Africa, after which they perform mutilations on pre-pubescent girls for as little as £40, often without anaesthetic, using blunt knives, razor blades or scalpels. It is estimated that as many as 66,000 women in the UK have suffered FGM with 24,000 girls under 11 also at risk.","Home affairs select committee launches first official inquiry into FGM .

Bringing light: The told CBS News the new baby 'was bringing light and joy into their lives.' Francine Wheeler is pictured here while pregnant with Matthew . In the wake of the the December 2012 horror at Sandy Hook Elementary, the Wheelers set up a charitable organization called Ben’s Lighthouse 'in honor of Ben Wheeler and his Sandy Hook classmates to promote the long-term health of the children and families in the region while nurturing an environment of non-violence and caring.' The couple and their son moved to Sunnyside, New York after the tragedy. According to the website for Ben's Lighthouse, their slain son was 'quick to smile, quick to laugh, eyes sparkling always with his love of everything (and a good deal of mischief) he was an energetic spirit.' Brothers: The Wheelers have another son, Nate (left), who said he wants to be the best big brother he can be. Benjamin is pictured at right .

Lanza killed 20 first-graders and six educators with a semi-automatic rifle inside Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14. He also shot and killed his mother inside their home before driving to the school, and took his own life with a handgun as police arrived. The shooting plunged the small New England community into mourning, elevated gun safety to the top of the agenda for President Barack Obama and led states across the country to re-evaluate laws on issues including school safety .","Francine and David Wheeler welcomed Matthew Bennett Wheeler in to the world last week .

"Early this morning, two high energy proton beams crossed at the Large Hadron Collider, breaking the world record for energy in such collisions. The 8 TeV (teraelectronvolt) collisions mark the start of the 'end game' for the Hadron Collider's hunt for the Higgs boson, the ‘God particle’ that would complete Albert Einstein's theory of the universe. As the LHC's crew declared 'stable beams' it marks the start of a year of experiments that will either find or rule out the existence of the particle. The LHC is now scheduled to run until the end of 2012, when it will go into its first long shutdown. Scientists are confident the Higgs will be found or ruled out before that point . 'The experience of two good years of running at 3.5 TeV per beam gave us the confidence to increase the energy for this year without any significant risk to the machine,' explained CERN1’s Director for Accelerators and Technology, Steve Myers. 'Now it’s over to the experiments to make the best of the increased discovery potential we’re delivering them!' Higgs particles, if they exist, will  be produced more copiously at 8 TeV than at 7 TeV - the previous operating power of the machine - but background processes that mimic the Higgs signal will also increase. That means that the full year’s running will still be necessary to convert the tantalising hints seen in 2011 into a discovery, or to rule out the Standard Model Higgs particle altogether. 'The increase in energy is all about maximising the discovery potential of the LHC,' said CERN Research Director Sergio Bertolucci. 'And in that respect, 2012 looks set to be a vintage year for particle physics.' As the LHC's crew declared 'stable beams' it marks the start of a year of experiments that will either find or rule out the existence of the particle . The LHC is now scheduled to run until the end of 2012, when it will go into its first long shutdown in preparation for running at an energy of 6.5 TeV per beam as of late 2014, with the ultimate goal of ramping up to the full design energy of 7 TeV. 'By the time the LHC goes into its first long stop at the end of this . year, we will either know that a Higgs particle exists or have ruled out . the existence of a Standard Model Higgs,' said CERN’s Research . Director, Sergio Bertolucci in an earlier interview. 'Either would be a major advance in our . exploration of nature, bringing us closer to understanding how the . fundamental particles acquire their mass, and marking the beginning of a . new chapter in particle physics.'","Two high-energy proton beams hit energy record .

"A mother has come under fire for dressing her four-year-old daughter in a Hooters waitress outfit for a beauty pageant. Mother Liane, 33, from Portsmouth, created the controversial costume for Scarlett who featured in the Channel 5 documentary Blinging Up Baby. Hooters is a chain of restaurants with . waiting staff who are mainly young women in tight white tops usually . referred to as Hooter Girls. She even taught her a dance routine which included the splits and pelvic thrusts. Scroll down for video . Too young? Scarlett took part in a beauty competition wearing a Hooters costume made by her mum Liane . However, the costume and routine have been deemed 'inappropriate' by viewers. Unemployed single mum Liane has ploughed everything into entering six-year old Bessie-Sue and four-year-old Scarlett into glitzy U.S.-style beauty pageants. She said: 'They are very talented little girls but then I have invested a lot in them. 'I am ambitious for them and I do push them. 'She would probably be a tomboy if I let her,' says Liane, confessing that she had been a tomboy herself. Liane has ploughed everything into entering six-year old Bessie-Sue and four-year-old Scarlett into glitzy U.S.-style beauty pageants . 'I suppose that's what I'm influencing onto them, that they don't do everything wrong that I did when growing up' she said. To compete in the Teeny Miss Beauty competition, Liane decides to dress Scarlet in a Hooters waitress outfit. Defending the decision, Liane said: 'You do try and be original, so something you have not seen before. 'Some people may say it as controversial espeically the theme that I have chosen but at the end of the day little girls wear swimming costumes to the beach all summer and that's not a controlled environment. To compete in the Teeny Miss Beauty competition, Liane decides to dress Scarlet in a Hooters waitress outfit . Liane even taught Scarlett a dance routine which included the splits and pelvic thrusts . 'The environment my kids go in is a controlled environment and it is ticket entry only so if anyone thinks it's controversial then please explain because it aint at all.' However, not all mothers at the competition agreed with the choice. One parent said: 'I think Hooters is a bit inappropriate for a small child' while another thought it was 'fabulous'. However, viewers took to Twitter to vent their disgust. Two Hooters 'girls' hold a plate of chicken wings in an advert for the chain restaurant . One said: 'Who the hell puts their child in a Hooters outfit and teaches them pelvic thrusting moves? How disgusting!' Scarlet is not the only child to feature in the documentary. Sophie-May Dickson, 22, from Essex, sees nothing wrong with giving her daughters - Princess Bliss Tiana May, four, and PreciousBelle Ruby Rozina, two - the works including spray tan, nail polish, and designer clothes. Dressed to impress: Sophie-May with her daughters Princess (left) and Precious (right) Princess regularly applies hair serum to her own hair and shares an incredible designer wardrobe worth thousands of pounds with her sister. The closet, which could rival many women’s wardrobes, includes a pair of Ralph Lauren sparkly flat shoes costing £90 and a D&G child's dress costing up to £400. Princess's flashy pink bed costs around £1,000. Let us spray: Princess closes her eyes and has her hair covered by nets for the fake tan . Her two year-old, Precious Belle Ruby Rozina, whom she describes as a ’tomboy’ has her ears pierced and nails done. Both girls wear gold hoops in their ears and Ms Dickson reveals that Precious had her first pedicure at nine months. At Fairytale in Birkenhead, Marie Fullerton has been making bespoke children's wear for 25 years, but has never been as busy as she is today. The four-year-old perseveres with the treatment, which she asked for after seeing her mother have it . As a result of the huge demand, she now employs her son, daughter and daughter-in-law to help her. It is not just clothes that they are asked to bling up – people have brought in potties, prams and even bath tubs, following a lead from Beyonce and the Kardashians. 'Once you go into blinging, you cannot go back,' says daughter Hayley. 'I bling me phone cases, me make-up bag, everything...' As Marie prepares to expand into a boutique in the high street, she invites a few select customers in for a preview. One of Marie's customers is 26-year-old beautician Sammy from Doncaster, who started buying frilly dresses and crystals for one-year-old Halle May before she was even born. 'I think that every woman thinks of their daughter as a doll,' she says. She trawls the internet for specialist boutiques, buying her own little doll designer clothes online months in advance. Despite limited cash, her daughter's wardrobe is worth thousands.","Liane, 33, from Portsmouth, created the controversial costume for Scarlett .

"When seven-year-old Kady Akester went trick or treating with her mother she hoped to get some sweets and at worst thought she may come across some scary Halloween costumes. But when the child and her mother returned home to look at the treats she had gathered, they discovered an unwelcome surprise inside. In a sealed tub of Marks and Spencer Super Berry and Almonds mix lay an inch-long screw. Toni Cole, mother to Kady, said she was shocked by the discovery and concerned about what could have happened had a toddler, or her younger son Zak, got hold of the tub. Kady Akester (right) was trick or treating with her mother Toni Cole (centre) and came back with a tub of M&S berries and nuts which had a screw in. Her mother was relieved her younger son Zak (left) had not got hold of it . The screw was spotted after Ms Cole handed the tub to her partner, Gareth Akester, 25, to show him their daughter's spoils. It is the second problem to hit M&S in a week after a pianist spotted a dead earwig in his wholefood salad. Ms Cole, of Hull, East Yorkshire, said: 'I am disgusted - a child could have choked to death on that bolt. 'I had wanted to open the tub of nuts while we were out, but fortunately Kady said, ""No mummy. We'll wait until we get home."" The one-inch long screw was spotted by the seven-year-old's father after she showed him her treats . Marks & Spencer said it was investigating how the screw got into the tub. The incident follows the retailer's apology last week after a dead ear wig was found in an M&S nutty super wholefood salad (right) by Lee Reed . 'When we got home I handed the tub of nuts to Gareth but before he opened the tub he spotted a bolt, which was about an inch long. 'We put the tub away in a cupboard, because we didn't want to risk the children opening it. 'It's a good job Zak wasn't with us when we were out trick or treating. Ms Cole said it was fortunate her daughter had decided not to open the tub until they got home . 'I'm sure he would have wanted to open the tub straightaway and I'd have probably let him.' Initially the parents thought the tub may have been tampered with by a Halloween prankster, but when they checked it was still sealed. Ms Cole added: 'It would have been horrible if a younger child had found the bolt.' It is not known in which M&S the nuts, costing £2.99, were bought but Ms Cole took the tub into a city centre store, where the manager said they would investigate. An M&S spokesman said: 'We're sorry to hear about Miss Cole's complaint. 'Quality is extremely important to us so we've asked the customer to send us the fruit and nut pot, which she has done, and we're now investigating further.' Last week pianist Lee Reed was horrified after he discovered a dead earwig in his M&S nutty super wholefood salad. The retailer apologised and gave him a £15 voucher, saying the discovery was an 'isolated incident.' It is also not the first time a screw has been found lurking in a bag of sweets. Last year Stephen Friel, 47, found a screw in a bag of Haribo sweets in his nine-year-old daughter's Christmas stocking.","Toni Cole took her seven-year-old daughter out trick or treating in Hull .

"This gigantic furry fish ball chair would be ideal for keeping you warm during these cold winter's nights. Amazingly, the design by Jason Goh from Singapore is based on the fish balls his parents make - and a scary tale his grandma used to frighten him with. Jason, 36, who studied at the University of Glasgow, explains: 'I used to play with my food when I'm young, especially the fish balls, as my parents are both fish ball noodle sellers. Called a 'Moyee', Jason Goh's gigantic furry fish ball chair was inspired by the fish balls his parents used to make and a scary story his gran used to tell him in order to stop him playing with the food on his plate . His gran used to tell him in her Teochew dialect: 'If you keep playing, the fish balls will turn into a big hairy monster and eat you up.' 'That spiked my wild childhood imagination,' Mr Goh said . Called a 'Moyee', it is equipped with a . glowing LED mood lamp, which Jason says will help the user 'sit . comfortably in the cocoon-like space to read a book or chill out . You will need: . 2 pounds of fish fillets1/2 cup of water1/2 teaspoon of salt1 teaspoon of cornstarch1/2 teaspoon of sugar . 1. Mince or grind fish. Place in a large bowl. Add water, salt, cornstarch and sugar. Knead by hand to blend. 2. Stir mixture firmly, in one direction only, until it takes on a fluffy consistency. 3. Lift mixture and toss it back hard against the bottom of the bowl. Repeat 15 to 20 times, or until mixture stops spattering and has an adhering quality. 4. Drop into oil heated to 375 degrees F. and fry until golden brown or boil. 'In order to stop me from doing that, . my grandma came up with a scary fish ball monster story, which I still . remember till these days.

The inflatable ball has a base filled with water to prevent toppling and can be deflated to easily tuck away when it's not in use. Fish balls are a common food in Singapore and are made minced fish and flour. They are usually sold at food stalls similar to hot dog stands in the United States. Fish balls are usually boiled in a spicy curry sauce or deep fried and are one of the country's most popular and representative 'street foods'. Though the chair is not for sale, Goh's chair is currently exhibiting in the National Museum of Singapore until January 27th.

"The Department of Homeland Security will grant temporary protected status to people from the three West African countries most affected by Ebola who are currently residing in the United States, department officials said on Thursday. People from Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone in the United States as of Thursday may apply for protection from deportation, as well as for work permits, for 18 months, said a Department of Homeland Security official. After 18 months, the Secretary of Homeland Security will assess whether the protection should be extended, based on the level of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Health workers from Guinea's Red Cross are pictured carring the body of a victim of the Ebola virus in Momo Kanedou in Guinea this week . The move is a response to the Ebola epidemic, which has claimed more than 5,000 lives, mostly in the three West African countries. In order to prevent a mass migration from West Africa to the United States, nationals from these countries who arrive after Thursday will not be eligible for protected status. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials estimate that 8,000 people will be eligible to apply. 'The Ebola response in the United States has been front and center in the United States government at high levels,' said a Department of Homeland Security official. 'This designation has been part of that constant monitoring, reevaluation and reassessment of the appropriate response.' The United States reserves temporary protected status for people from countries experiencing conditions deemed too dangerous to return to, such as Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Unlike other recipients, protected people from West Africa will not be allowed to travel home and then return to the United States, in order to prevent the disease from spreading. Nationals from the three countries must undergo a background check in order to receive protected status. Those with a criminal history will not be approved, said the Homeland Security official.","The U.S. reserves temporary protected status for people from countries experiencing conditions deemed too dangerous .

"A schoolgirl who went to hospital suffering from headaches was horrified to be told she had a brain tumour the size of an orange. Doctors discovered the benign tumour inside Holly Dougill-Brooks's brain after they realised she had lost sight in her left eye over a matter of months. Holly, eight, had started getting headaches last year but after an eye test showed no problems a viral infection was put down as the cause. Hope: Holly Dougill-Brooks will fly to Florida with her mother Melanie (left) for proton beam therapy, to treat her brain tumour . But the headaches came back in February and after visiting the GP with her mother Melanie Dougill, she was referred to the ophthalmic department at Northampton General Hospital. When she had her appointment in July doctors said that unbeknown to Holly she had gone blind in her left eye. An emergency MRI scan revealed an orange-sized tumour in her brain. Holly was diagnosed with craniopharyngioma, a slow-growing tumour which is normally impossible to remove without causing serious damage. She had an operation to shrink the tumour by half around five weeks ago. She will travel to Jacksonville in Florida for a revolutionary treatment called proton beam therapy, which doctors hope will cure the condition. However, she will be blind in her left eye for the rest of her life. The treatment, which is only available in the USA, France and Switzerland, is similar to radiotherapy but does not damage the surrounding tissue, and reduces the risk of secondary tumours in later life. Miss Dougill from East Hunsbury, Northampton, said: 'Holly deals with everything remarkably bravely. She is the most resilient child I've ever come across. She's happy, cheerful and takes it all completely in her stride. 'It's so hard to describe how we felt. It was absolute devastation. I don't think I'll ever forget that moment when they sat us down and said: ""Holly has a brain tumour"". But you learn to deal with it day by day.' 'Remarkably brave': Holly has already had one brain operation . Talking about Holly prior to the diagnosis, she added: 'We are pretty certain Holly's eyesight was fine when she first went to the opticians (in August 2010) and just deteriorated rapidly that year. 'There was nothing obvious at that point to suggest there was a problem. Her school teachers or family didn't notice anything. When I talked to Holly she thought it was no big deal. 'She had an emergency MRI on the Monday, and on the Wednesday we were called back and informed she had a brain tumour and was being referred to Nottingham for a biopsy and further investigation.' The NHS is funding the U.S treatment, which is being coordinated by the National Specialised . Commissioning Team. The health service is also paying Holly's and her mother's travel costs. Miss Dougill's employer, the Continuum Group, is raising money to help Miss Dougill's partner Nathan and Holly's dad Alan to visit her during her treatment. Miss Dougill said: 'It's fantastic. I can't thank them enough. They have really gone above and beyond what we expected anyone to do for us.' Holly will undergo treatment for two months in America. It finishes on December 23 but she will be recovering for two weeks before she is well enough to fly back. Miss Dougill added: 'She will have this condition for life. Essentially there will still be a tumour left in her brain but it won't be growing and will be significantly smaller. 'It has virtually destroyed her pituitary gland and she will be on medication for the rest of her life but she should be able to lead a normal life.'",Holly will have a revolutionary treatment in America to try and remove most of the brain tumour .
"For climate change activists, this week was marked by an 'I-told-you-so' moment after a group of experts from around the world released their annual report indicating that the Earth is getting warmer. The State of the Climate in 2013 report, published online Thursday by the American Meteorological Society, showed that greenhouse gases, sea levels, global temperatures and other key climate indicators were all on the rise last year. The report, compiled by 425 scientists from 57 countries around the world, provides a detailed update on global climate indicators, notable weather events, and other data collected by environmental monitoring stations and instruments on air, land, sea, and ice. New high: The levels of CO2 at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii hit 400 parts per million for the first time in 2013 . Stark contrast: With rising air and sea temperatures, mountain glaciers continue shrinking. Pictured here is Italy's Careser Glacier in 1933 (top) and 2012 (bottom) ‘These findings reinforce what scientists for decades have observed: that our planet is becoming a warmer place,’ said NOAA Administrator Kathryn Sullivan. ‘This report provides the foundational information we need to develop tools and services for communities, business, and nations to prepare for, and build resilience to, the impacts of climate change.’ Climatologists point a finger of blame at record-breaking levels of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, which are responsible for trapping heat inside the Earth's atmosphere making the surface of the planet warmer. Emissions that come from burning fossils fuels reached historic highs last year, according to the report. The levels of CO2 at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii hit 400 parts per million for the first time in 2013 - and these changes did not go unnoticed. In Australia, 2013 was the hottest year on record, while in Argentina and New Zealand it was the second and third warmest, respectively. Balmy: Sea surface temperature in 2013 compared to the 1981-2010 average. The dark red and blue areas reveal areas of the global ocean that were up to 4º Fahrenheit warmer or cooler than average. Inching up: The map shows where average sea level in 2013 was above or below its long-term average. Places where sea level rose up to 8 inches higher than the 1993-2010 average are dark blue, average levels are white, and places where sea level fell below average are brown . Hotspots: Earth surface temperatures in 2013 compared to the 1981-2010 average . Air temperature around the world was among the balmiest since record-keeping began in 1880, with 2013 ranked between second and sixth hottest, depending on methods of calculation used by different groups of scientists. As a result of melting ice sheets and warmer temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, sea levels continued rising at a steady pace, adding another one eighth of an inch from the year before. There was also more bad news for polar bears as the arctic sea ice extent continued to decline while temperatures over land in the region climbed faster than anywhere else on the planet. For example, the city of Fairbanks, Alaska, saw 36 days of temperatures above 80 degrees last summer. There were more examples of extreme weather events in 2013, like the deadly Super Typhoon Haiyan, which devastated portions of Southeast Asia in November. Disaster roundup: From devastating cyclones to crippling drought, this map highlights the events that climate scientists from around the world have concluded should go down in the record books as the year's most significant . The monster storm had the highest wind speed ever recorded for a tropical cyclone at 196mph. In addressing the bleak climate trends laid out in the report, Tom Karl, director of the National Climatic Data Center, compared Earth to a person trying to maintain their weight, only to add a couple more pounds each year, LiveScience reported. 'We are continuing to see ourselves put on more weight from year to year,' Karl said during a press conference Thursday.","State of the Climate in 2013 report by American Meteorological Society showed greenhouse gases, sea levels, global temperatures were on rise .

"A doctor who sent a toddler home from hospital three days before he died from dehydration 'failed to properly examine the youngster', a tribunal has heard. Dr Tasnim Arif should have used more caution in dealing with Harry Connolly at Northampton General Hospital, an expert claimed. Harry was suffering from lethargy, vomiting and diarrhoea when he was admitted on April 28, 2011. Tragic: A doctor sent Harry Connolly home three days before he died from dehydration . Dr Arif, a paediatric registrar, told concerned mother Lucy that they should go home after deciding the boy was not dehydrated. Three days later Harry’s father Raymond found his son dead in his cot. A post-mortem concluded he had died of dehydration and kidney failure. Expert Dr Dipak Kanabar, a consultant at Evelina London Children’s Hospital, said: ‘Although Dr Arif has made some assessment of hydration status, in my opinion it is an inadequate one.’ He said Dr Arif should have carried out blood tests and explained that a longer period of hospital assessment was required. Inadequate: A post-mortem concluded Harry had died of dehydration and kidney failure . Harry Connolly's parents begged for their son to be kept in hospital but were told he was fine to go home . Dr Kanabar said it is possible Harry’s condition could have been managed differently had blood tests been taken on time. ‘A greater degree of caution needed to be applied in this case,’ he added. Mrs Connolly has said she found the doctor ‘difficult, cold, hard-hearted and uninterested’ when she asked her to find out what was wrong with her baby. Dr Tasnim Arif should have 'used more caution' an expert has said . The tribunal has heard that Harry fell ill on April 23 and was referred to hospital by the family GP on April 26. The boy was examined by paediatrician Dr Farhana Shamim, who said he was not dehydrated, and discharged the following morning by Dr Ayevbekpen Omorgie. At around 3.30pm on April 28 Harry was brought back to hospital by his mother, after his parents felt he was not getting any better and seen by Dr Arif. Dr Arif discharged Harry at around 5.45pm on the afternoon of April 28, telling his mother that he was not dehydrated. The next day grandmother Val Faulkner rang the hospital but was told by a nurse they should take the toddler to their GP or accident and emergency if his condition was deteriorating. After phoning the GP out-of-hours service, the family spoke to Dr Mary McCracken who said they should bring him in to the out-of-hours service as he may be suffering from dehydration. At the out of hours service, Harry was examined by Dr Aboo Thamby who assessed that he was not dehydrated and did not need to be readmitted to NGH. By April 30 Harry’s parents reported that he was ‘brighter’ but his fingers and toes were very cold.He was found dead by his father early the next morning. Dr Arif is accused of professional misconduct for treatment that fell ‘seriously below’ the expected standard. It is alleged that the doctor failed to fully record that Harry was still passing blood in his stool, that he had not eaten for five days or that he was lethargic. Dr Arif has admitted that she failed to record how often Harry was passing stool and vomiting and did not ask for further clarity on the subject. The medic also admitted to not comparing his current weight to his weight when he was previously discharged on April 27. However, she denies failing to adequately assess or record a number of clinical features when assessing the baby’s hydration status, including the overall summary of ‘well hydrated’ or ‘not well hydrated’. Dr Arif also denies failing to arrange a longer assessment period, not arranging the duty consultant to review Harry’s clinical status and failing to arrange for blood tests, as the consultant had asked. At an inquest in 2012 Coroner Anne Pember catalogued a series of ‘failings’ by doctors and nurses at the hospital and a GP’s out-of-hours service. The hospital made a formal apology to the family following the coroner’s findings. The hearing continues.

Lynne Featherstone, an international development minister who was in charge of equalities until September’s reshuffle, said childbirth was a ‘barrier’ to women’s career success. She said women who devoted time to bringing up children suffer a ‘setback’ because it gives ‘mediocre’ men an opportunity to leapfrog them on the corporate ladder. Her forthright remarks come as her party leader Nick Clegg announced plans to allow men and women to share their parental leave. But he was forced to drop more radical plans to extend paternity leave to six weeks after opposition from the Tories and business. Maria Miller, the new equalities minister, will today announce plans for start-up grants to help people launch childcare businesses – part of a drive by the Coalition to appeal to women voters. Miss Featherstone, 60, a single mother of two grown-up children, believes women are yet to achieve the same status as men. She said: ‘One of the main barriers to full equality in the UK is the fact women still have babies. ‘[Having a baby] is a bit of a setback to women because it gives an opportunity – whether it’s in commerce, politics or wherever you work – to men to climb the ladder faster. ‘I have seen many mediocre men on boards of directors. They get there because they had no break on the way.’ Nick Clegg, who announced major changes to parental leave, paid a visit to the 'Third Door' nursery in Putney where he played with a dinosaur . She added: ‘Women have had to fight . every inch of the way because there aren’t the same kind of networking . opportunities and then there is the career break if you have children – . so women have not been present when others took their opportunities. ‘I was a single mother with two . children. It’s really tough to manage it all. And if you are managing it . all you feel guilty – we women still haven’t got over our own issues.’ Miss Featherstone said better and . cheaper childcare would help resolve the issue, and that there was more . work to do on the issue of equal pay. The proportion of all FTSE 100 directors who are female is now 16 per cent, up 2.5 per cent in the last three years. A group of Tory MPs is launching an . investigation into why so few executive directors in the country’s . biggest companies are women. The Executive Women in the Workplace . inquiry, co-chaired by Therese Coffey and Mary Macleod, will take . evidence from companies, investors and recruitment firms.","Former equalities minister claims 'mediocre' men can climb the career ladder while mothers take time off work .

"A New York high school teacher who was secretly photographed kissing and cuddling one of her students on a park bench last year exchanged 1,400 texts with him over 11 days during their short-lived affair, city investigators have revealed. Manhattan Theatre Lab HS teacher Julie Warning, 26, was fired earlier this year over the fling with her 18-year-old pupil, Eric Arty, Department of Education officials revealed yesterday. When the photos first emerged last May it was uncovered that the high school teacher had fallen victim to a cruel and crude $500 bet between five friends about who could kiss her first. The look of lust: New York teacher Julie Warning, 26, was filmed as she kissed and snuggled at student Eric Arty, 18, in broad daylight in a city park last May . Sly students got passing tourists to take the photos of Warning and Arty in order to make sure she wouldn't recognize them . Manhattan Theatre Lab HS teacher Julie Warning, 26, has been fired over her fling with a student . The sly students even got passing tourists to take the photos, in order to make sure the teacher wouldn’t recognize them. Arty beat his friends to the jackpot . after first making phone contact with Warning in October 2011, and . stayed in touch on and off until their very public make-out session last . May. When questioned by city . investigators, Arty admitted to kissing his teacher but insisted it had . been a ‘one-time occurrence,’ the investigative report says. However he got ‘uncooperative’ after that and refused to say anything further, reports the New York Post. Warning also met with the Department of Education Special Commissioner of Investigations, but 'declined to answer any questions about the matter'. There was no criminal investigation because Arty was above the legal age of consent at the time of the affair. The Department of Education was able to dismiss the novice teacher with relative ease because she was untenured. Warning had only been appointed to her $48,434 teaching position as a social . studies teacher at Manhattan Theatre Lab HS in October 2010. Speaking last May about Arty's seduction technique, classmate Andrew Cabrera said: 'He would go after class and basically . try to seduce her. 'I don't know if she knew [about the bet]. They were all trying to get with her. 'One of his [Arty’s] friends . flirted with her more than anyone - I thought he would be the one, but . Eric came out of nowhere and got her.' School of trouble: Warning taught at Manhattan Theater Lab High School where she met student Eric . Romantic setting? Warning and Arty were seen locking lips in the middle of this park in Manhattan's Greenwich Village . Arty beat his friends to the $500 jackpot after first making phone contact with Warning in October 2011, and stayed in touch on and off until their very public make-out session last May . Other students told The New York Post . how Warning at first tried to resist the teenagers and threw them out . of her classroom when they would try to chat her up. 'He [Arty] would flirt with her,' said one junior. 'She would try to avoid it because she was his teacher. 'She was a nice teacher and didn’t . want to report him, and she would throw him and his friends out of class . for trying to flirt with her.' Maia Torruella, 16, said: 'The way they act together... When he . walks into the room, her face lights up,' she said. 'And when he's . gone, she's boring. You can tell he's still on her mind. 'They're always so nice to each other. He flirts with a lot of girls, sure, but Miss Warning, ohhhhh!'","Social studies teacher Julie Warning has been fired over last May's fling with a student .

Before the end of the year, astronaut Koichi Wakata is due to become the first Japanese commander of the space station. Kirobo has been programmed to recognise Wakata's face and will be able to identify him when the astronaut begins his expedition. It will then keep records of conversations with Wakata as well as be used on missions to relay messages from the control room to the commander. Mirata will act as a go-between and can also check for problems in the machine's electronic components.

"Accused: Sahar Thabit, 35, pictured, allegedly heated up a kitchen knife on the stove before branding her daughter in three places . A South Florida mother has been charged with child abuse after she burned her daughter's arms with a hot knife because she refused to marry her cousin. The disturbing case of honor violence was reported to police by the 17-year-old's school, South Broward High, after her friend told teachers that the girl was being abused at home. According to authorities, Sahar Thabit, 35, heated up a kitchen knife on the stove before branding her daughter in three places after discovering the girl had been talking to a boy in the family's native Yemen over the Internet. The violence began in early January at the family's West Hollywood home. The girl told authorities both her parents knew of the incident. The burns - two on her left forearm and one on her upper right arm - caused permanent disfigurement, the police report noted. The unnamed teen's father was questioned by police and initially claimed she had been burned by a stove. When detectives highlighted that the burns were in three different areas, the father, who hasn't been named, asked for an attorney. Outside the family house yesterday, the victim's grandfather, Ali Alomari, gave the same explanation, saying, 'She burned herself in the stove.' He also told NBC Miami: 'I swear to God I didn't see anything.' The teen is reportedly now living with family friends. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Home: The abuse allegedly took place at the family's West Hollywood home, pictured, in January . Grandfather: The victim's grandfather, Ali Alomari, pictured, said the girl burned herself on the stove . The police report said a friend of the girl reported the abuse to a school administrator, who later called police. The friend said the teen said her parents became angry when she said she didn't want to marry her cousin in an arranged marriage but wanted to marry a boy she had met on the Internet who lives in Yeman. The daughter told police she knew talking to the boy online was strictly forbidden in the family's religion, particularly when she had already been promised to another man. According to the friend, the teen's parents were also verbally and mentally abusive towards her, calling her names like 'whore' and 'slut.' She told police her friend was so upset over her the situation she'd tried to commit suicide. After conducting a series of interviews with witnesses and the victim, detectives determined Thabit had used the knife to abuse her daughter. School: South Broward High School, pictured, told police about the abuse after the girl's friend informed teachers . Police weren't able to interview Thabit because she only speaks Arabic, the affidavit said. She was arrested and later released on $22,500 bond and was ordered to have no contact with her daughter. The girl's father told NBC Miami over the phone that the family is going through difficult times with the allegations and said he didn't want to comment. Nova Southeastern University psychology professor Lenore Walker told the TV station that the alleged abuse inflicted on the 17-year-old was similar to an honor killing. 'The rationale is that you're shaming your family by getting involved with a boy or a man who is unacceptable for whatever reason. In this particular case, it's because she was promised to another man and so she talked on the Internet, not even face to face,' Walker said.","Sahar Thabit, 35, from Hollywood, allegedly heated up a kitchen knife on the stove before branding her daughter in three places .

"'I cannot explain, justify or defend the horrifying deaths of hundreds of Palestinians': Ed Miliband has come out against Israel's ground attack on Gaza . Ed Miliband has said he opposes Israeli military action in Gaza, saying it will not ‘help Israel win friends’ and could make the situation worse. The Labour leader opened up a dividing line between himself and David Cameron by saying he could not defend the ground incursion Israel launched a week ago following Hamas rocket fire. The Prime Minister has described the conflict as a ‘human tragedy’ and said earlier this week that he had urged Israel to try to minimise civilian casualties. But Mr Cameron strongly defended  Israel’s right to respond to attacks and condemned the refusal of Hamas – which runs Gaza – to end rocket fire and accept offers of a ceasefire brokered by Egypt. Mr Miliband struck a different note in an interview with the  Huffington Post website in Washington, saying: ‘We oppose the Israeli incursion into Gaza. I don’t think it will help win Israel friends. I don’t think this will make the situation better. I fear it will make it worse.’ He had said over the weekend: ‘As a party we oppose the further  escalation of violence we have seen with Israel’s invasion of Gaza. I defend Israel’s right to defend itself against rocket attacks. ‘But I cannot explain, justify or defend the horrifying deaths of hundreds of Palestinians, including children and innocent civilians.’ Mr Miliband, who once described himself as a Jewish atheist, added in the interview that the conflict was likely to help recruit people to Hamas – the militant Islamist group which forcibly took power in Gaza in 2007 – and called on all parties to restart peace talks. It is a shift from the position of former Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, who were staunch supporters of Israel using force to defend itself from attacks. Mr Cameron told the Commons this week that Israel has a right to defend itself against rockets from Gaza, which are ‘indiscriminately targeting civilians’. ‘Those criticising Israel’s response must ask themselves how they would expect their own government to react if hundreds of rockets were raining down on British cities today,’ he told MPs. ‘This unprecedented barrage continues to this moment, with Hamas rejecting all proposals for a ceasefire... I have been clear throughout this crisis that Israel has the right to defend itself.’ Defenceless: A wounded Palestinian girl is checked for internal bleeding by a medic at a hospital in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip yesterday after an Israeli military strike near her family home . Last year Mr Miliband refused to back air strikes in Syria to help rebels defeat government forces. It was a rare division between opposition and government over foreign affairs, which saw Mr Cameron defeated in a Commons vote. Israel has said its intention is to permanently weaken Hamas and attack tunnels under the border, which armed militants have used to infiltrate civilian areas in Israel. Labour’s foreign affairs spokesman Douglas Alexander yesterday said the Israeli incursion had been a ‘strategic error’, which ‘risks …  recruiting more supporters to  terrorist groups like Hamas’. █ German leader Angela Merkel yesterday condemned a rise in anti-Semitism, as protesters in France were warned against racial abuse. French cities were braced for demonstrations last night, after a Paris rally last weekend saw riots and looting of Jewish-owned shops. Four men were jailed for up to six months for their roles in the unrest.","Labour leader opens dividing line between himself and Cameron over Israel .

"Prince Harry made a ‘mistake’ in saying he had killed Taliban fighters, Afghan president Hamid Karzai said yesterday. Speaking ahead of talks with David Cameron at Chequers, Mr Karzai declined to comment in detail about the Prince’s controversial claims, but said: ‘He’s a young man, and young men do make mistakes talking.’ Mr Karzai also provocatively claimed that life in Afghanistan’s notorious Helmand province was better, and safer, before British troops arrived in 2006. Scroll down for video . David Cameron hailed today's deal with Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan (left) and Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari (right) at a summit at Chequers . The three men agreed that peace talks to secure the future of Afghanistan had to involve the Taliban . Prince Harry, 28, spoke last month about his 20-week posting as an Apache helicopter gunner in Afghanistan. ‘Take a life to save a life, that’s . what we revolve around,’ he said. ‘If there’s people trying to do bad . stuff to our guys, then we’ll take them out of the game.’ His comments caused controversy here . and angered some in Afghanistan. Mr Karzai, a friend of Prince Charles, . yesterday made clear his disapproval, but stressed the matter should go . no further. The three leaders said that ¿significant progress¿ had been made since they last met in September . The trilateral meeting, held at the Prime Minister's official country retreat, was the third such meeting in less than a year . He said: ‘Prince Harry is a young man, we do give exits to young men when they make mistakes.’ Mr Karzai described the growing spate . of insider attacks on Western forces by members of Afghanistan’s . security forces as a ‘serious breach of hospitality’. He insisted that Helmand province was better off before British troops arrived in 2006. Prince Harry talked about 'taking out' Taliban insurgents during his tour of duty in Afghanistan . ‘In 2002 through to 2006, Afghanistan . had a lot better security. When we had our own presence there, with very . little foreign troops, schools were open in Helmand and life was more . secure.’ But he insisted he did not want to . ‘blame’ Britain for making the situation worst – and insisted that . Afghans ‘appreciate the sacrifices of the British forces’. Mr Karzai . said it was unclear whether Britain and the US, which will withdraw . combat troops next year, were leaving because they thought they had . achieved their mission in weakening Al Qaeda or because they had . realised they were ‘fighting in the wrong place in the first place, so . they should discontinue doing that and leave’. His comments are likely to cause . controversy in the UK, which has spent more than £17billion on the . Afghan conflict and lost 440 soldiers. Tory MP Patrick Mercer, a former . Army officer, said: ‘This message will hit the many bereaved families in . this country very hard. I hope that President Karzai is sincere when he . says he appreciated the sacrifice our young men and women have made.’ President Karzai’s comments came ahead . of talks at Chequers with Mr Cameron and Pakistan’s president Asif Ali . Zardari on the future of Afghanistan. Mr Cameron is trying to broker a . security deal between the two countries to be in place before Western . combat troops leave Afghanistan in 2014. Islamist extremists are . threatening both countries. He urged them to encourage moderate elements of the Taliban to join peace talks. Mr Zardari (left) peace in Pakistan depended on peace in Afghanistan, adding: 'We feel that we can only survive together' Mr Cameron said the three countries agreed that Afghanistan must never  become a 'haven for terrorism' The summit included senior political, military and intelligence figures from the three countries, including Mr Cameron, Mr Karzai, British Foreign Secretary William Hague, national security advisor Kim Darroch, the UK Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir David Richards, and MI6 chief Sir John Sawers .

"Twitter users have hit back at the GOP staffer who called Malia and Sasha Obama classless - by reminding her of Jenna Bush's more unseemly moments while her father was in office. Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Rep Stephen Fincher, issued a groveling apology on Friday after slamming the President's girls, aged 16 and 13, for wearing casual clothing and looking sullen during the Thanksgiving address. Calling for the self-professed media expert to be sacked, thousands of people responded by tweeting the renowned picture of George W Bush's daughter Jenna drunkenly tumbling over her friend on to the floor of a frat party, cigarette in hand. The 2001 photo, which earned the then 19-year-old the nickname Jenna And Tonic, has gone viral with the hash tag '#classy'. Scroll down for video . Hit back: Twitter users have been sharing pictures of former First Daughter Jenna Bush (left) looking bored and raucous after a GOP staffer slammed Sasha and Malia Obama (right) for 'classless behaviour' 'Classy': Images of George W Bush's daughter have gone viral since the outburst on Thanksgiving Day . Open letter: Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Rep Stephen Fincher, wrote this to the girls . Other responses included a picture of the moment Jenna, one of the former president's twin daughters, stuck out her tongue at White House photographers while riding in the presidential limousine. 'Did you forget that jenna bush got photographed at the age of 19 knocking someone over at a FRAT party? good lord,' one Twitter user wrote. Another commented: 'The Bush twins used fake ID's to get into bars. & Jenna Bush stuck out tongue at press. Is that ""classy?"" @DCGopGirl #tcot #UniteBlue.' One wrote: 'Where were your ignorant comments on the Palin family brawl, the Bush girls (Jenna & Tonic).' 'So Sasha and Malia Obama have no class? Two words: Jenna Bush. #ElizabethLauten,' one tweet read. And one said: 'I have a feeling that Jenna Bush & sister are a little ticked off at #ElizabethLauten for bringing their past behavior into the spotlight.' By Saturday evening hundreds of people had demanded that Lauten lose her job as communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.) under the #FireElizabethLauten Twitter hashtag. Lauten had apologized for her post, writing that 'judgmental feelings truly have no place in my heart', saying that 'hours of prayer' had shown the error of her ways. 'Dear Sasha and Malia,' she wrote in the post, recorded by The Root reporter Yesha Callahan, 'I get you're both in those awful teen years, but you're a part of the First Family, try showing a little class.' Lauten, communications director for Rep Stephen Fincher of Tennessee, added: 'Act like being in the White House matters to you. 'Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. 'And certainly don't make faces during televised public events.' Reaction: They prompted soft criticism for sullenly scowling at their father, the President, on Thanksgiving . Twitter users rushed to defend the girls who Lauten said 'deserve a spot at a bar' rather than the White House . Sasha, 13, was dressed in a short maroon dress with a long cream cardigan that matched her thick cream socks, worn over bare legs. Her sister Malia, 16, wore black tights under a mini kilt with a grey and cream jumper. After the President had pardoned the designated bird, a four-month-old 49-pounder called Cheese, he asked Malia if she wanted to pet the turkey. 'Nah', she replied, in a rare departure from her usual, gracious disposition, which prompted a flurry of remarks from viewers. Unimpressed: The First Daughters looked bored and unimpressed by their father's jokes about turkey . Clothing: Sasha wore a maroon dress and cardigan while Malia wore a mini kilt with black tights and boots . 'Awful teenage years': The cyber-bullying post addressed to the young girls said they are at an 'awful' stage . Star Jones, a lawyer and television personality, was among those unimpressed. 'I’ve seen tacky people…but rarely seen someone as tacky as #ElizabethLauten for slamming the children of the #POTUS' she tweeted. One commenter, whose username is Eclectic John, wrote: '@RepFincherTN08 There is nothing that excuses what #ElizabethLauten posted re the children of our President. That's off limits. Fire her now.' The incident was not Lauten's first social media slip-up. In August, she posted a tweet from her boss's verified Twitter account about 'shagging'. Apology: Hours later she removed the original outburst, issued an apology and set her page to private . Firing: Many Twitter users directed messages to Lauten's boss, Stephen Fincher . Stephen Fincher's followers were baffled when he tweeted: 'God I love this song. And beach music. AND shagging #pandora,' in reference to an Embers playlist on Pandora radio. Lauten later deleted the post and apologized for the 'accident' - but insisted 'shagging' is a dance term rather than a sexual reference. 'It had nothing to do with Stephen Fincher. I don’t think he knows what Pandora is; he certainly doesn’t have it,' she said, according to Politico. Following mass outrage to her post on Thursday, Lauten deleted it, set her profile to private, and issued an apology: 'I reacted to an article and quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager. Other accusations: Lauten also took aim at Barack and Michelle Obama, saying they 'don't respect their roles' Her critique was in response to a national broadcast of the annual White House turkey pardon . The national Thanksgiving turkey Cheese is seen in front of Barack Obama and his two daughters . 'After many hours of prayer, talking to my parents and re-reading my words online, I can see more clearly how hurtful my words were. 'Please know that these judgmental feelings truly have no pace in my heart. 'Furthermore, I'd like to apologize to all of those who I have hurt and offended with my words, and pledge to learn and grow (and I assure you I have) from this experience.' This year, Malia and Sasha were declared by TIME as two of its 25 Most Influential Teens of 2014. In an interview earlier this year with Today, Michelle Obama told Jenna Bush Hager their family emphasizes health over appearance: 'We don’t talk about weight. We don't talk about physical appearance. 'We talk about health. We talk about what's on the inside. We spend so much more time talking to our girls about being kind and treating others well, and being passionate and respectful.' Reaction: Twitter users were outraged by Lauten's attack on the young girls on the national holiday .

The satanic mass, which is thought to have included a ritual denouncing Jesus Christ and stomping on and spitting on a wafer representing the consecrated Host, was held at the Oklahoma City Civic Center. It was led by Adam Daniels, a self-avowed devil worshipper who fronts the Dakhma of Angra Mainyu Syndicate. He claimed the purpose of the mass was to de-program people from the influences of Catholicism and Christianity. Religious critics walked in procession to the Civic Center, where protesters from around the region had gathered to demonstrate against the Satanic ritual . The 'black mass' was led by Adam Daniels (pictured), a self-avowed devil worshipper who fronts the Dakhma of Angra Mainyu Syndicate. He claimed the purpose of the mass was to de-program people from the influences of Catholicism and Christianity . 'We've had  protests before, but I've never seen anything of this magnitude,' said a civic center spokesperson . Roughly 40 people assembled at the small theater at the bottom of the civic center to participate in the 'black mass'. Meanwhile, around 1,200 Roman Catholics crowded into St. Francis of Assisi Church to hear a holy hour prayer service led by Archbishop Paul S. Coakely, Fox News reported. Those who could not find space in the sanctuary filled an adjacent gym and cafeteria area, while roughly 400 others gathered outside to hear the service piped through speakers. Archbishop Coakley told protesters that Oklahoma City had been targeted by 'dark forces,' but added that Christians 'know that Christ conquered Satan. The war has been won, Christ has conquered, though skirmishes will continue until Christ comes to reign forever.' The 'black mass' - attended by around 40 people - also included rock music . Archbishop Coakley told protesters that Oklahoma City had been targeted by 'dark forces,' but added that Christians 'know that Christ conquered Satan. The war has been won, Christ has conquered, though skirmishes will continue until Christ comes to reign forever' The service was followed by a procession to the Civic Center, where protesters from around the region had gathered to demonstrate against the Satanic ritual. Prior to the event, Mr Daniels told the Tulsa World that when his Oklahoma City-based Satanic group conducts the black mass in private, it involves sex, urine and nudity. But Mr Daniels insisted that the Civic Center ceremony would tone down those elements to comply with state law. 'This is not a game. It's very serious to us,' he said. 'My devil is an equal anti-cosmic spirit that is the antithesis to what most call God. 'If you call chaos, freedom and self-service evil, then I'm one wicked individual. … I'm no more evil than a lion who eats a gazelle.' Mr Daniels said the mass wound begin with music by the band God in a Machine, followed by a lecture on the purpose of the black mass and a ritual denouncing Jesus Christ and swearing allegiance to the devil. Officials at the civic center said that under the U.S. Constitution, Satanists have the same right as any other group to rent facilities in the city . The ritual would also involve stomping on and spitting on a wafer, representing the host. The plan was to conclude the mass with a reverse exorcism, casting the Holy Spirit out of the person. Jennifer McClintock, a spokeswoman for the civic center, told the newspaper that the city has received thousands of communications from people opposed to the black mass, although they cannot be sure how many are duplicates. 'We've had some protests before, but I've never seen anything quite of this magnitude,' she said. But despite the uproar over the service, city officials said they would not block the ritual from going ahead because the Civic Center is a public building. Hundreds turned out to protest against the ritual satanic mass in Oklahoma Civic Center . They said that under the U.S. Constitution, Satanists have the same right as any other group to rent facilities in the city. 'A city-owned civic center for rent cannot, in effect, censor unpopular speech by refusing to rent to unpopular speakers. This is nothing new,' explained KSN legal analyst, Dan Monnat. 'Unpopular free speech is permitted under the Constitution, so long as it is not otherwise breaking the law.' Mr Daniels, who has been involved with Satanist for around 14 years, told the Tulsa World that he was not upset about the outcry across the state and nation against what he is doing. 'We're glad that we have this opportunity to expose these people's self-righteous behavior,' he said.","About 40 Satanists gathered for the ritual 'black mass'

"Susan May, 58, endured years of torture at the hands of her own son, Leigh May, 21 . A mother who suffered years of abuse at the hands of her ADHD child has spoken of the moment she thought he was going to kill her. Susan May, 58, endured years of torture at the hands of her own son, Leigh May, 21. From being spat on to having her hair pulled, the final straw was when he placed his hands around her neck. Susan desperately alerted her neighbour for help and police were called to the family home. Leigh has now been ordered not to approach his mother or enter the road where she lives in Chester after appearing at Flintshire Magistrates Court on July 9. Susan said: 'I gave him everything and I got nothing back. 'That final beating he had his hands round my neck and I thought he was going to kill me. 'When Leigh was growing up Mold court was my second home. 'Even though his convictions were against me I was having to pay the court costs when he was under 18. 'Even after that I would still pay. I got his carers allowance for his ADHD, but he would borrow money off me for God knows what. 'In the last year I leant him over £2,000, and my partner leant him £1,000, none of which we’ll ever see again.' Leigh was diagnosed with ADHD aged just five but unknown to his mother he was not taking his tablets at school. Scroll down for video . His behaviour got worse at secondary school and Leigh was eventually expelled. Susan said: 'Leigh hung around with a lot of the older boys and started smoking cannabis.

Once close: Susan wraps her arm around her son Leigh May as a toddler before he began to get into trouble . 'I knew he smoked cigarettes because I would find them and snap them, but then the signs of drug use started appearing. 'When he was just 12 I found a bag of white powder and called the police. 'He went mad, but it was the only way I thought he would get help.' After that Susan says Leigh’s drug use spiralled and he also started dealing drugs. He would borrow money from his mother and use her credit card and store cards as well. Getting older: Leigh was diagnosed with ADHD aged just five but he was not taking his tablets at school . Susan recalls finding a bag of white powder when Leigh was 12 and she called the police . Susan May holds a photograph showing herself with her son Leigh when he was a child . Susan said: 'I tried to give him the best of everything, but nothing was ever enough. 'It was £100 here, £200 there, just to stop the men from knocking on my front door. 'I even got him a new Xbox for Christmas, only for him to sell it on Gumtree a week later.' Despite everything the pair have been through, Leigh has never once apologised or shown remorse to his mother, according to Susan. Susan May (left) said she tried to give her son Leigh (right) the best of everything but nothing was ever enough . Even when her partner Michael was admitted to hospital with cancer earlier this year, Leigh’s behaviour still did not change she said. She said: 'He has never said sorry to me about anything, even when my partner nearly left because of his behaviour. 'I have only seen him cry once, and that was when he broke up with his girlfriend. 'He lives with her now and I really hope he will turn his life around. 'I’m not going to see him for five years and hopefully then he will be better. 'But I don’t think he will change without help and I don’t want history to repeat itself.' The court heard how Miss May believes her son has mental health issues with many of his problems stemming from his use of drugs. May himself claimed a £7,000 drugs debt had resulted in him being threatened with a gun which was placed inside his mouth. He received a 20-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months and was placed on supervision. Leigh was also told by District Judge Andrew Shaw he had been spared an immediate custodial term due to significant changes he had since made to his lifestyle.","Susan May, 58, endured years of torture at the hands of her son .

"A futuristic train that could on day become the future of underground rail travel has been unveiled. A full-size concept model of Inspiro - a driverless train that is more energy efficient than current models in use with more creature comforts for commuters, will go on show at an exhibition in London. Siemens, the company behind the concept, has hinted that next generation Tube trains like Inspiro, which costs a whopping £1million a carriage, could be built in Britain if the mayor placed an order for the new trains. Scroll down for video . This is a full-size concept model of Inspiro - a driverless train that is more energy efficient than current models in use with more creature comforts for commuters that will go on show at an exhibition in London . The carriages are lit with LEDs and are fully air conditioned, as well as doing away with dividing doors separating the carriages, to give 30 per cent more capacity than some of the older carriages in use on the London Underground . The Inspiro is 30 per cent more energy . efficient and 20 per cent lighter than similar modern metro trains. The carriages are lit with LED lights and are fully air conditioned, as well as doing away with dividing doors separating the carriages, to give 30 per cent more capacity than some of the older carriages in use on the London Underground. Siemens said that commuters would also benefit from wider door openings in the carriages to avoid the rush-hour crush of people piling on and off the underground trains. Controversially the train does not rely on a human driver and if ordered for the capital one day, would not be popular with trade unions. A full size mock up of a Siemens Inspiro metro train on display at the press preview of an exhibition showcasing future developments in underground rail travel at The Crystal, Royal Victoria Docks . Siemens said that commuters would also benefit from wider openings in the carriages to avoid the rush-hour crush of people piling on and off the underground trains . The news, reported by The Evening Standard, that the train could potentially be built in Britain, follows the Government's decision to award funding to Transport for London for the Tube specifically, based on its claim that new orders for carriages will be given to firms based on Britain. London-based commuters pining for a more spacious and stylish way to travel to work will be able to see the concept model from October 8, when it goes on show on the site of The Crystal in Royal Victoria Docks. An accompanying exhibition will also highlight technologies built to help travellers find their way more easily, as well as the latest development in ticketing and passenger information systems, that could make navigating cities easier in the future. While the interior might looks welcoming, controversially the train would not rely on a human driver and if ordered for the capital one day, would not be popular with trade unions . Steve Scrimshaw, managing director of Siemens Rail Systems UK, said: 'London, in common with many large cities around the world, faces significant transport challenges as a result of ongoing population growth and increased capacity demands. 'Our exhibition highlights some of the innovations that can be considered by cities to help their metro systems tackle these issues and help passengers benefit from an improved travel experience. We wanted people to have a really personal experience, sitting in the seats of a brand new, futuristic train and interacting with the exhibits on display in a way that not only informs but excites at the same time.'

Mr Semenov, who has a degree in Zoology from Lomonosov’s Moscow State University, is head of the dive team at the White Sea Biological Station. He said: 'When I first began to experiment with sea life photography I tried shooting small invertebrates for fun with my own old dslr camera and without any professional lights or lenses. 'I collected the invertebrates under water and then I shot them in the lab. After two or three months of failure after failure I ended up with a few good pictures, which I’ve showed to the crew. 'It has inspired us to buy a semi-professional camera complete with underwater housing and strobes. Thus I’ve spent the following field season trying to shoot the same creatures, but this time in their environment. 'It was much more difficult, and I spent another two months without any significant results. But when you’re working at something every day, you inevitably get a lot of experience. 'Eventually I began to get interesting photos — one or two from each dive. 'Now after four years of practice I get a few good shots almost every time I dive but I still have a lot of things that need to be mastered in underwater photography.'

"An outspoken pro-Israel politician caused outrage across France today by comparing the mutilated corpse of a Palestinian child to ‘Halal meat’. Jacques Renaud, the right wing deputy mayor affiliated to the UMP opposition, portrayed the killing of an infant in the Gaza Strip as being similar to animals being slaughtered according to Islamic ritual. Mr Renaud's comment came as thousands prepared to take to the streets of Paris in a pro-Palestine demonstration which many fear will lead to violence. Scroll down for video . Mr Renaud's response to the tweet, which has been deleted from his account, but has been re-tweeted by several Twitter users . Jewish . groups have accused anti-Semites of hijacking the rallies, while . thousands of Muslims taking part say they are being unfairly labelled as . extremists. Mr . Renaud, 66, who is also a successful businessman, wrote on Twitter: . ‘Great support to all the attacked Jews of France, we are in the 21st . Century, a bit of humanity and civility would be welcome.’ A . critic responded by tweeting a picture of a decapitated child, . referring to the Israeli army having killed more . than 200 children during its assault on Gaza. In response to the image Mr Renaud replied: ‘It’s Halal meat, I suppose.’ Halal is Arabic for permissible, and refers to food which adheres to Islamic law, as defined in the Koran. Halal meat is a big issue in France, where the five million plus Muslim community regularly complains about government attempts to outlaw it. Mr Renaud is a firm supporter of Israel and regularly takes to Twitter to attack Hamas, the ruling authority in Gaza. Stephane Piednoir, the UMP mayor of Montreuil-Juigne was on holiday so not able to respond to his assistant’s words, but a spokesman said there would be ‘grave consequences’ if the comments turned out to be true. Mr Renaud was not available for comment. Pro-Palestinian protesters hold a giant Palestinian flag during protests in Paris today against violence in the Gaza Strip; officials fear the protest could lead to further violence . A banned pro-Palestine march ended in violence on Saturday, and on Sunday a synagogue in a northern suburb of Paris was threatened by a mob of rioters. Despite the street violence, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said tonight’s protests could go ahead, with security stepped up across the capital. Mr Cazeneuve said: ‘I have given specific orders to security forces so they can quickly intervene if any anti-Semitic acts are committed.’ Anti-Semitic chants are banned under French criminal law and – to date – there has been no evidence of any being used on the marchers.","Jacques Renaud warned there will be 'grave consequences' over remark .

"Complaints: Andrew Schiff, who makes six figures, bemoans that his apartment doesn't have a dishwasher . Forget the one per cent. These guys are the WHINE per cent. Several Wall Street bankers and execs have come forward to voice their discontent about just how daunting it is to survive on their six-figure salaries in interviews with Bloomberg.com. Andrew Schiff, the communications and marketing director at Euro Pacific Capital, hates traffic just like most New Yorkers, but unlike most in the Big Apple, he’s feeling the crunch from a $350,000 salary. Mr Schiff told Bloomberg: 'The New York that I wanted to have is still just beyond my reach'. The Brooklyn resident lives in a pretty sizable apartment by New York City standards, but bemoans the fact that it came without a dishwasher. Mr Schiff said. 'I'm crammed into 1,200 square feet. I don’t have a dishwasher. We do all our dishes by hand'. He told the site that he needs a 600-square-foot extension for the place to allow 'a room for each kid, three bedrooms, maybe four'. 'Imagine four bedrooms. You have the luxury of a guest room, how crazy is that?' It's about as crazy as the worries of Alan Dlugash, a partner at accounting firm Marks Paneth & Shron LLP in Manhattan. Mr Dlugash told Bloomberg: 'Could you imagine what it’s like to say I got three kids in private school, I have to think about pulling them out? How do you do that?' Groans: Alan Dlugash, left, says those without money don't understand . the stress,' while Richard Scheiner, right, has been clipping coupons . He added: 'People who don’t have money don’t understand the stress'. Mr Dlugash said he has been advising . bankers about their expenses. ‘If you don’t cut that, then you’ve got to . cut this,’ he told Bloomberg. ‘They say: “But I can’t”. And I say, “But . you must”.’ 'I'm crammed into 1,200 square feet. I don’t have a dishwasher. We do all our dishes by hand' Andrew Schiff, Euro Pacific Capital . Investment banks hit by falls in revenue are cutting back pay - with at least 25 per cent trimmed at Goldman Sachs and Barclays Capital. Meanwhile the Wall Street cash bonus pool plummeted by 14 per cent last year to $19.7billion and the pay structure of most employees has changed, reported Bloomberg. The average U.S. household income as a median was just shy of $50,000 in 2010 and more than 15 per cent of Americans now live in poverty. But Richard Scheiner said that he and his wife have kept their heads above water because they have saved their money. Financial centre: A pedestrian walks past the Wall Street street sign in front of the New York Stock Exchange . Still, the 58-year-old real estate . investor and hedge fund manager admitted that he spends about $17,000 a . year in expenses - for his dogs, and sold two of his motorcycles, . according to Bloomberg. At . least he still has his Porsche 911 Carrera 4S Cabriolet, two Audis and . his $7,500 a year membership at the Trump National Golf Club. 'Could you imagine what it’s like to say I got three kids in private school, I have to think about pulling them out? How do you do that?' Alan Dlugash, Marks Paneth & Shron . Wall Street headhunter Daniel Arbeeny has been reduced to coupon-cutting after a dramatic drop in his income. Mr Arbeeny told Bloomberg: 'They have a circular that they leave in front of the buildings in our neighbourhood. We sit there, and I look through all of them to find out where it's worth going. He even cut out his annual ski trips to Tahoe and Aspen to save money. For people like Mr Schiff, the PR and marketing executive, it's all about the triumphs of achievement. He told the website: 'I wouldn’t want to whine.

"In her 20s, Charlotte Hawkins resembled a pin-up with soft curls and a clear, flawless complexion. But when as a teenager, she discovered a lumpy patch of skin at the bottom of her back, Ms Hawkins could not predict the impact the subsequent diagnosis would have on her life. Within 10 years the mother-of-one was barely recognisable, her face and body covered in bubble-like tumours. Today, the brave grandmother lives with America's worst case of the incurable disorder Type 1 neurofibromatosis. Scroll down for video . Charlotte Hawkins, 64, from Georgia, lives with America's worst case of the incurable disorder Type 1 neurofibromatosis, which causes dozens of benign bubble-like tumours to cover her face and body . In her 20s, Ms Hawkins, resembled a pin up with her glamourous up-do and flawless complexion, right. But within 10 years she was barely recognisable, her whole body covered in bubble-like tumours, left . The 64-year-old has grown to accept her appearance after 49 years of living with the disease. But as a young woman she admits living with the extremely rare condition has been hard. Ms Hawkins, who lives in a trailer in Loganville, Georgia, said: 'First I got scared. I didn't know how people were going to react when they saw me. 'When I would go out it was kind of rough - people would stare at me.' She was 15 years old when  she first noticed the mysterious growths starting to appear on her back. The teenager underwent surgery to have the benign lumps removed. She said: 'When I was about 15 I had a patch on my face, I didn't know what the name of it was, because I was 15 and nobody explained it to me. 'I also had one on my back and I had it taken off and stayed in the hospital a couple of days. 'And after that I didn't seem to have anymore. 'I got married and I left home. And when I was pregnant they said I would probably have a normal baby. When I had Charles he was healthy and there wasn't anything wrong with him.' But the growths began to return, with pronounced lumps starting to appear on her face and back. 'My husband never did say anything about my disease but it was getting worse and by the time we separated it had got very bad,' she said. For years the condition held her hostage in her home until a church group invited her to take part in their community, helping children at a weekly playschool, pictured . When she was 15 years old, Ms Hawkins first noticed a patch of lumpy skin at the bottom of her back. Surgeons removed the lumps, but within time they returned, with more starting to appear on her face and neck . Neurofibromatosis is the name of a number of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along the nerves. Tumours are swellings formed by a growth of cells. In most sufferers, their tumours are usually non-cancerous. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is the most common form of the rare condition, affecting around one in 3,000 births. Sufferers are born with NF1, although symptoms often develop over a number of years. The severity varies considerably from person to person. In most cases it causes: . Around one in three people also develop a range of further health problems: . The condition is caused by a genetic mutation, where instructions that are carried in all living cells are scrambled in some way. There is currently no cure for the illness, instead patients are regularly monitored. Treatment can include surgery to remove tumours. Source: NHS Choices . Ms Hawkins was diagnosed as having type 1 neurofibromatosis. However, her case was so severe, the lumps began spreading and it was no longer possible to keep removing them. Suffering from depression and struggling with being a single mum, Ms Hawkins's condition became increasingly difficult to deal with in her 30s as people were starting to notice her condition. She was left traumatised when she 'terrified' a child in the supermarket with her face - an event which resulted in her spending many years as a recluse. She said: 'I was in Walmart and this little boy when he saw me, he started screaming and crying. 'And his mother had to go and I hurried to get out of the store. I was walking out from what I can remember but he was having a fit.' For years Ms Hawkins led a quiet life, until she was contacted by her local church and was finally made to feel accepted in the community. She began helping out at the church's playgroup, telling stories and teaching prayers to the youngsters. Working with the children turned her life around, as the toddlers accepted her without question and treated her the same as everyone else. Now Ms Hawkins is a happy grandmother-of-three and loves babysitting for neighbours' children in the caravan park where she lives. 'I love children,' she said. 'I live in a great community. I love playing with the kids and reading them stories. They help to make me feel young.' Her friend Anne Schuffer, a playgroup volunteer, said: 'I cannot remember a single time she's ever complained. 'And there have been times that people have said things to her or reacted in a way that have kind of hurt her feelings but Charlotte just keeps going. 'She has never said: ""I just don't know why I have this,"" or, ""I just don't understand it"".' She said: 'I love children. I live in a great community. I love playing with the kids and reading them stories. They help to make me feel young' Her friend Anne Schuffer, said: 'I cannot remember a single time she's ever complained.' Ms Hawkins is pictured left, as the disease began to take hold, and right before the tumours developed on her face . Neurologist Dr Coruna Shah said: 'Neurofibromatosis is a genetic condition and it is passed on in families by an abnormal gene that is present in a chromosome. 'Charlotte comes for regular check ups. What we do is check all the individual tumours to see there has been no change in growth or size of the tumours. 'We also look into her eyes and make sure there is no loss of vision in her eyes, as there can be tumours of the optic nerve in the back of the eye and can cause her to go blind. 'It's always going to be a challenge as she gets older because her vision is going to change.' It's now nearly 49 years since Ms Hawkins developed her first tumour and she is happy that her son Charlie and three grandchildren are completely healthy and show no signs of developing the condition.

Whoopi thinks a Michigan man who punished his 4-year-old by forcing him to hold up a humiliating sign was in the right . Rosie Perez was first to shun what Rob Devine forced his son Tristan to do. 'He's a little kid,' the actress asserted, raising her signature voice for one of the first times since joining the show. 'He's 4-years-old, it's a little bit extreme.' Whoopi wouldn't back down, though, so former George W. Bush aide Nicolle Wallace put in her two-cents. 'I don't think you teach a kid a lesson by shaming,' said the communications maven. Then, as if to make amends for the rift that emerged between them on Tuesday, a miracle happened: resident fiery liberal Rosie O'Donnell agree with Wallace. 'Shame is never a way to teach a child anything' said O'Donnell, whose own special-needs son once grappled with a hitting problem before the family sought therapy. 'They're not emotionally ready to understand.' But even in an episode where the panel touched on the Adrian Peterson child abuse issue and selfies in the gynecologist's office, day three was a departure from day two when Wallace and O'Donnell shared some seriously tens . Disagreement: It was Whoopi's turn to anger the group on Wednesday as she sided with a father with some controversial thoughts on displinine . Whoopi agreed: The creative punishment used by Rob Devine (right) when he discovered his son Tristan had been harassing female classmates became a source of a classic The View clash. Nicolle and both Rosies said 4-year-old is too young to humiliate a child . The once-booted co-host compared a characterization Wallace made of Obama's lack of warmth with the 'international incident' that came when rapper Kanye West publicly declared that Bush's response (or lack thereof) to the Katrina disaster meant he hated black people. 'He revealed was how personally wounded he was by that statement,' Wallace said of her then boss, who wrote of his dismay over West's assertion in his 2010 memoir Decision Points. She then called O'Donnell's words 'an attack.' O'Donnell snatched the opportunity to turn Wallace's words against her. 'He was very upset in the plane as he flew over Katrina,' quipped the comedienne. 'It was a very long time before he showed up. That is a fact, not an attack.' Wallace, who just the day before admitted on the show that she had nothing to do with Bush's decision not to visit Katrina--but simply fly over it--was forced to agree. Ironically, on the season's same inaugural episode, O'Donnell made sure to say of Wallace: 'I like her, I swear!' Whether that's true or not, the hot and cold chemistry appears to have worked, at least for the time being. The season 15 premier on Monday won the show its highest ratings in eight years. According to The Wrap, it's the second most watched premier ever for the daytime series. More to come? Republican Nicolle Wallace and liberal Rosie O'Donnell traded some harsh words during a very tense moment on just the second episode of The View's new lineup .","Nicolle and both Rosies said 'no way!' to Whoopi's siding with Michigan dad who punished 4-year-old by forcing him to hold shameful sign in public .

"Allen Daniel Hicks Sr was taken in by police in May 2012 after they spotted him veering on the road . A driver who had a stroke on the road died after being left untreated in a jail cell for 36 hours. Allen Daniel Hicks Sr was taken in by police in May 2012 after they spotted him veering on the Interstate 275 in Tampa, Florida. He is said to have been rambling incoherently and dragging his left leg as the policemen booked him into jail. He lay on the floor of his cell for more than a day before being taken to Tampa General Hospital and diagnosed is an ischemic stroke. The 51-year-old went into a coma and died months later, reported the Tampa Bay Times. State officials are now opening a review into health contractors Armor Correctional Health Services Inc almost a year after his death. Armor is responsible for managing prisoners health care in Hillsborough County Jail system. The Department of health has refused to comment or confirm the investigation, but lawyers for Hick’s family say they have been contacted by a medical quality assurance investigator. Armor spokeswoman Yeleny Suarez said the company had not been contacted by the Department of Health, but the Sherriff’s office had been in touch. They add that they: ‘will cooperate fully with ongoing investigations.’ Armor cares for prisoners at 13 country jails and four Department of Corrections in the state. They are also involved in prison management of four other states. They earn $20million per year from Hillsborough alone. The officials left Mr Hicks on the floor of the jail cell without noticing he had had a stroke . Thea Clark, deputy chief legal counsel for the Sheriff's Office, said that jail officials have provided all of their records to the state. This includes jail surveillance video and internal memos that were critical of Armor. Clark sent an internal memo earlier this year stating that a Tampa General Hospital neurosurgeon who treated Hicks ‘was extremely critical of the medical care provided by Armor’ to Hicks during his stay at the Orient Road and Falkenburg Road jails. Mr Hicks, who was from Tampa (pictured), was left in a coma and died months later . Hicks' heirs were paid $200,000 in a wrongful-death settlement by the Sherriff’s Office, in addition to $800,000 paid by Armor . An internal review cites at least ten nurses who were involved in the care of Allen Hick. The Department of Health can take action to suspend or revoke the medical licenses of individuals, but does not have power to regulate many businesses and institutions.","Allen Daniel Hicks Sr was jailed after they spotted him veering on the road .

"David Whitlock Whitlock has not showered for 12 years but prefers to spritz himself with bacteria . Most of us spend substantial amounts of time and money washing germs off our skin and hair. However, according to one chemical engineer, we should be spraying them on instead. Indeed, David Whitlock has not showered for 12 years but prefers to spritz himself with bacteria: ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB), to be precise. Mr Whitlock, an American, first became interested in the power of these micro-organisms, which live in soil, rivers and the ocean, when his girlfriend asked why her horse kept rolling around in the dirt. The scientist eventually discovered that the animals developed this behaviour to ensure they get enough bacteria on their bodies to stop their sweat from putrefying and smelling in the hot summer months. Human sweat works in exactly the same way, breaking down into ammonia, which smells but which can be neutralised by the presence of AOB. The problem is that, due to our modern insistence on hygiene, most of us no longer have any of these good bacteria living on our bodies. Mr Whitlock’s skin, though, boasts billions. For the last 12 years he has sprayed himself with AOB that he has collected from soil in the pigsty, cowshed and chicken coop of an organic farm. He washes his hands with a bar of soap before touching food and after going to the lavatory, but otherwise relies on an occasional rubdown with a sponge – and a regular spray of Refreshing Cosmetic Mist as he calls his concoction. The problem is that, due to our modern insistence on hygiene, most of us no longer have any of these good bacteria living on our bodies . He has also made the product available to other reluctant washers. ‘Bacteria is the new black, wear it every day’ is the firm’s slogan. He promises it will give users softer skin and a smoother complexion. Remarkably, sales have been so high that the mist is currently out of stock. The company is now developing products that they say could cure eczema and skin allergies as well as heal wounds.","American scientist David Whitlock  spritzes himself with ammonia-oxidising bacteria .

"Peter Dowling resigned after a letter was written to parliament accusing him of having an affair . An Australian politician has resigned after he was caught sexting lewd pictures to his mistress. Married Peter Dowling, a member of Queensland state's ruling conservative Liberal National Party, has also been accused of using government funds to conduct a two-year affair. The woman claiming to be his mistress wrote to state parliament Speaker Fiona Simpson detailing their trysts. Dowling has been with wife Helen for 27 years and they have two children together, reported the Huffington Post. But, the mistress said that she had been assured his marriage was just for show and that he intended to leave her after the 2015 election. She added that she was just one of many woman the politician had an affair with. The Courier-Mail has also claimed that it has access to: ‘Several explicit text messages sent from Mr. Dowling's mobile phone to the woman, including a picture of his penis in a glass of red wine, a self-shot image of his crotch while wearing boxer shorts, and a full frontal picture of his genitalia.’ Mr Dowling is also accused of taking advantage of parliament business trips to meet the woman.Her name was not released and her face was blacked out in published photos of her and the politician. Dowling, a Catholic and family-man, was part of the Australian Parliament’s ethics committee. Dowling, a Catholic and family-man, was part of the Australian Parliament's (pictured) ethics committee . Mr Dowling said he was stepping down . as ethics committee chairman and from the parliamentary crime and . misconduct committee until an investigation by the Clerk of Parliament . into his travel is complete. In . a statement after his resignation, Dowling said: ‘To Helen, to my . children, mum, brother and sister, my extended family and friends, I am . sorry for the shame and embarrassment I have caused you. I am not proud . of the events plastered all over today's paper and I cannot and will not . defend any part of it.’ He allegedly sent a photograph of his penis in a glass of wine (stock pictured) 'In relation to the allegations made to the use of travel allowances, I can assure the House that I have complied fully with all the guidelines and requirements of the parliament,' he said. 'However, I do not wish for this issue and for my family to be dragged through the media any longer than necessary. I will answer any questions, front any investigation. 'I don't want pity. I only ask that my family be left alone while this matter is considered by the clerk.' A senior government official told The Australian that he couldn’t understand how a ‘smart’ man like Dowling could do that. He added: ‘Taking a picture of your penis in a glass of red isn't the smartest thing you could do, and I won't be accepting any invitation from him in the future to go for a drink.’ This comes after New York Mayoral candidate Anthony Wiener was discovered sexting and sending lewd pictures of himself to a 22-year-old. Weiner said that as their marriage deteriorated he had returned to sexting women lewd pictures of himself. He also confessed to frequent phone sex with 22-year-old Sydney Leathers and sending pictures of himself to two other women under the pseudonym Carlos Danger. Leathers claims Weiner was texting and calling her for graphic phone sex up to five times a day through Election Day 2012 . She now says she wants to confront her ex-online lover ‘face to face so she can tell him to ‘stop being a hypocrite, stop humiliating his wife and stop embarrassing the city.’ She said Weiner had told her nearly 100 times over-the-phone, ‘The people of New York love me.’ Video: 7NEWS .

"Vitaly Milonov said the terms of the law could not be suspended or selectively enforced during the Olympic Games . Openly gay athletes and supporters at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games may face arrest, according to a Russian lawmaker. Politician Vitaly Milonov said the terms of the law could not be suspended or selectively enforced during the Olympic Games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) previously claimed Russia had assured the safety of athletes and supporters. Milonov told Interfax news agency: ‘I haven’t heard any comments from the government of the Russian Federation, but I know that it is acting in accordance with Russian law. ‘And if a law has been approved by the federal legislature and signed by the president, then the government has no right to suspend it. It doesn’t have the authority.’ He also claimed that American politicians he had spoken with support his view, reported the Huffington Post. He said that they: support the stance I have taken on this issue.’ The IOC told the Windy City Times earlier this month: ‘The International Olympic Committee is clear that sport is a human right and should be available to all regardless of race, sex or sexual orientation. ‘The Games themselves should be open to all, free of discrimination, and that applies to spectators, officials, media and of course athletes. The Russian parliament issued a ban on spreading gay . 'propaganda' among minors that gay rights activists said would fuel . attacks on homosexuals . ‘We would oppose in the strongest terms any move that would jeopardise this principle.’ The controversial ‘gay propaganda’ law bans displays of ‘non-traditional sexual behaviour’ in public or in front of under-18s. The law allows the government to detain homosexual or sympathetic foreigners for up to 14 days. The Orthodox Church in Russia has demanded a national referendum on criminalising gay relationships in a move certain to deepen conflict with the West.  Picuttured: Officers detain gay right activists during a protest in Moscow . They could then face expulsion from the country. This is the latest in controversial decisions by the Russian government regarding homosexual people. Last month gay pride participants were badly beaten in St Petersburg and dozens were arrested.

"Gym-goers broke into a screaming match over whether or not a lawyer should be banned for working with the nurse who defied her Ebola quarantine. Norman Siegel has been representing Kaci Hickox in a highly-publicized battle against the states of New Jersey and Maine, which ordered her into isolation after she returned, symptom-less, from west Africa. Hickox has remained defiant, and sparked outrage when she went cycling and shook hands with members of the public. Anger: Norman Siegel (left) is facing outrage among his fellow gym-goers who want him banned from the workout equipment for fear he has been exposed to Ebola by his client Kaci Hickox, who doesn't have the virus . Exposed? One gym-goer feared Normal Siegel has been exposed and could spread the disease by sweating . But it seems the panic has spread to Equinox Sports Club in Manhattan, where regulars fear her lawyer may have been exposed to the deadly virus and could 'sweat' on the work equipment. A source told Page Six: 'An argument broke out when two regulars fought over whether Norman, who is a regular, should be allowed in.' One is said to have shouted: 'They should ban Siegel! He's with that Ebola nurse' before warning: 'I'm going to tell the managers not to let Siegel in'. The outburst was met with: 'You are a f***ing moron!' The argument became heated, the source said, and almost came to physical blows. Siegel told the paper: 'I love working out and playing basketball [at Equinox], so I hope they don't ban me. 'This is based on the fear and misinformation on how the disease is transmitted that I have been dealing with all week. 'If I knew who it was that said that, I'd want to sit down and have a coffee with him - or something stronger - and talk through this.' Out and about: Hickox was ordered to be quarantined until November 10 after treating patients in Sierra Leone . Handshake: She sparked outrage by shaking hands with people and going about day-to-day life in Maine . The dispute came after Hickox and Siegel appeared in court on Thursday to fight Maine's bid to impose restrictions  until the 21-day incubation period for Ebola ends on November 10. Hickox, who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, contended confinement at her home in northern Maine violated her rights. The judge thanked Hickox for her service in Africa and acknowledged the gravity of restricting someone's constitutional rights without solid science to back it up. 'The court is fully aware of the misconceptions, misinformation, bad science and bad information being spread from shore to shore in our country with respect to Ebola,' he wrote. 'The court is fully aware that people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational.' Hickox, 33, stepped into the media glare when she returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone to become subject to a mandatory quarantine in New Jersey. Work: Hickox, pictured left, worked with patients in Sierra Leone, one of the countries worst-hit by Ebola . Conflict: Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey, was adamant the Hickox should be quarantined . After being released from a hospital there, she returned to this small town, where she was placed under what Maine authorities called a voluntary quarantine. She said she is following the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation of daily monitoring for fever and other signs of the disease. 'I'm not willing to stand here and let my civil rights be violated when it's not science-based,' she said earlier in the week. In a court filing, the director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention backed away from the state's original request for an in-home quarantine and called for restrictions that fall in line with federal guidelines. Hickox remains at risk of being infected with Ebola until the end of a 21-day incubation period, Dr Sheila Pinette. 'It is my opinion that the respondent should be subjected to an appropriate public health order for mandatory direct active monitoring and restrictions on movement as soon as possible and until the end of the incubation period ... to protect the public health and safety,' she wrote.","Norman Siegel represents Kaci Hickox who defied her Ebola quarantine .

"Long-ago crime: Robin Hall was jailed after police found a 22-year-old warrant for an $85 court fine . A woman is in jail unable to post bail after a bizarre set of circumstances led authorities to track her down – for a petty crime she committed 22 years ago. Robin Hall, now a married mother of two who designs jet engines, confessed to stealing a pack of cigarettes from a Florida Wal Mart in 1991. She was arrested Thursday as she, her husband, and two children disembarked from a Disney Dream cruise ship in Port Canaveral, Florida. Authorities were waiting for Hall, who owes the state a mere $85 in court costs, which they said she failed to pay at the time of the crime. Police found her, she said, by checking the ship’s manifest for potential terrorists, and finding that she still had an outstanding warrant. ‘I take full responsibility for what I did,’ Hall told NBC Connecticut, but added: ‘I do not believe I deserve this.’ According to WESH.com, the mother has straightened her life out since the 1991 arrest, graduating college with a degree in architecture. She now works for Pratt & Whitney, a jet design firm, in Connecticut. Held: Hall is being held at a Florida jail until she can be transferred to a different jail, where she can finally post bail . Cruise: She and her family were returning from a Disney Dream cruise on the 19th in Florida; Mrs Hall was met by police with an arrest warrant . The network states that Hall is unable to post bail at the Brevard County jail where she is held because the crime was committed in Orange County, and the distraught mother has to be transferred. ‘I just want it to be all over so I can go home,’ she told NBC Connecticut from her holding cell in Brevard County Jail. Because of the holiday weekend, Hall may be held until next Thursday. var nbcLP={};nbcLP.aRandomNumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*10000);nbcLP.currentPageLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.href);nbcLP.currentSiteLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.host);nbcLP.defaultWidth=652;nbcLP.defaultHeight=367;nbcLP.cmsID=""187829481"";nbcLP.vidPid=""uUeubsVds68v"";nbcLP.vidSec=""news"";nbcLP.vidSubSec=""local"";nbcLP.vidFrame=document.getElementById(""nbcLP187829481"");nbcLP.vidFrame.style.border=""none"";nbcLP.vidFrame.width=nbcLP.defaultWidth;nbcLP.vidFrame.height=nbcLP.defaultHeight;nbcLP.vidFrame.scrolling=""no"";nbcLP.vidFrame.src=""http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/templates/nbc_partner_player?cmsID=""+nbcLP.cmsID+""&videoID=""+nbcLP.vidPid+""&width=""+nbcLP.defaultWidth+""&height=""+nbcLP.defaultHeight+""&sec=""+nbcLP.vidSec+""&subsec=""+nbcLP.vidSubSec+""&turl=""+nbcLP.currentSiteLoc+""&ourl=""+nbcLP.currentPageLoc+""&rand=""+nbcLP.aRandomNumber; .","Robin Hall, a married mother of two, was arrested last Thursday after police found a 22-year-old warrant for her arrest .

"Ronald Reagan made secret plans to loan Britain a U.S. warship if she lost an aircraft carrier during the Falklands War, it has emerged. The then-president was prepared to support Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher despite the U.S. being officially neutral during the 1982 conflict. The stunning revelation was made by John Lehman, the former U.S. Secretary of the Navy, to the U.S. Naval Institute on Tuesday. Mr Reagan would have loaned Britain the use of the amphibious warship USS Iwo Jima should harm have come to either HMS Invincible or HMS Hermes, which the Royal Navy had deployed to defend the islands from Argentinian forces. Close ties: Ronald Reagan made secret plans to loan Margaret Thatcher a U.S. warship if Britain lost an aircraft carrier during the Falklands War, it has emerged . Loan: Mr Reagan would have handed Britain the use of the amphibious warship USS Iwo Jima (pictured) should harm have come to either HMS Invincible or HMS Hermes, which the Royal Navy had deployed to the Falklands . Mr Lehman said that he formulated the plans to stand behind Mrs Thatcher with Secretary of Defence Caspar Weinberger following a British request. Mr Reagan is said to have approved their proposal without hesitation, telling Mr Lehman: 'Give Maggie everything she needs to get on with it.' The plans were put together in complete secrecy. Mr Lehman said: 'We would leave the State Department, except for [Secretary of State Al] Haig, out of it. 'As in most of the requests from the Brits at the time, it was an informal request on a ""what if"" basis, Navy to Navy.' Both HMS Invincible or HMS Hermes were equipped to handle five vertical take-off Sea Harriers armed with American Sidewinder missiles. HMS Invincible was one of two aircraft carriers deployed to defend the Falklands from Argentinian forces. She was decommissioned in 2005 . Royal Marines take part in an exercise aboard HMS Hermes during the Falklands conflict . These specifications made the USS Iwo Jima an ideal replacement as, although primarily a helicopter carrier, it was able to operate the U.S. version of the Sea Harrier. It is likely that the ship would have . been manned by a mix of retired seamen and privately contracted . Americans familiar with the ship's operating systems. Admiral James 'Ace' Lyson, commander of the U.S. Second Fleet in 1982, helped plan the possible deployment of a U.S. ship in the South Atlantic. Now retired, he said: 'We decided that the USS Iwo Jima would be the ship that would be the easiest for the British to operate and would make for a smooth transfer. 'We also identified ""contract advisors"" who would be on board to help the British with some of the systems.' The revelation comes as diplomatic relations between Britain and Argentina reach their lowest point since the war. Falkland residents have announced plans . for a referendum next year in an attempt to fend off Argentinian claims . to the territory, which have become more vocal around the 30th . anniversary of the conflict. Last week, David Cameron was involved in an extraordinary stand-up row with Argentina’s president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner over the future of the Falkands. The South American leader appeared to attempt to thrust a package stuffed with documents about her country’s claim to the British territory into Mr Cameron’s hands at the G20 summit in Mexico. To her fury, the Prime Minister refused to accept it – and insisted that she respect the views of the islanders, who want to remain British.","Revelation made by former U.S. Secretary of the Navy John Lehman .

"An episode of the BBC's Frozen Planet documentary series that looks at climate change has been scrapped in the U.S., where many are hostile to the idea of global warming. British viewers will see all seven episodes of the multi-million-pound nature series throughout the Autumn. But U.S. audiences will not be shown the last episode, which looks at the threat posed by man to the natural world. It is feared a show that preaches global warming could upset viewers in the U.S., where around half of people do not believe in climate change. Sir David Attenborough presents and authors the 'On Thin Ice' episode. It looks at how the planet's ice is changing and what it means not only to the animals and people at the Poles but also the rest of the planet . The series of six episodes has been sold to 30 countries, including China, one of the world's biggest polluters. World TV networks have the option to buy a seventh 'companion' episode, along with behind-the-scenes footage. Ten of the countries have chosen not to use the final episode on climate change . In the U.S., Frozen Planet is being aired by Discovery. They were involved in the joint-production of the series. Yet they are still refusing to accommodate Frozen Planet in its entirety. The timing of a one-sided global warming programme could be particularly sensitive in the U.S., where climate change is an issue in the presidential race. GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry accuses climate scientists of lying for money. A poll earlier this year found that the majority of Americans believe that if climate change does exist, it is not caused by humans. Fifty-three per cent of Republicans say there is no evidence of climate change, while the number is far higher among Tea Party supporters, with 70 per cent saying the theory is 'junk science' pushed by groups with a vested interest. Sir David Attenborough presents and authors the series, the seventh episode of which, entitled 'On Thin Ice', looks at how the planet's ice is changing and what it means not only to the animals and people at the Poles but also the rest of the planet. In mother's footsteps: More than 30 international networks have bought the Frozen Planet series . The series examines various aspects of the polar wilderness over the seasons and follows the lives of creatures from polar bears and wolves in the Arctic to killer whales and penguins in the Antarctic . A spokesman for the BBC said it would not make sense to force television networks outside the UK to buy the episode as it features . 85-year-old Sir David talking a lot of the time to camera, and in . many parts of the world he is not famous. The broadcaster refused to say which . countries had shunned 'On Thin Ice'. They said it wasn't included in the . main package because it features Sir David 'in vision' which would make . it hard for other countries to translate into their own language. Discovery had dropped the full seventh episode due to 'scheduling issues', the spokesman added. However, environmentalists branded the decision 'unhelpful'. Harry Huyton, head . of climate change for the RSPB, accused networks who haven't bought the final episode of . 'censoring the issue'. A Greenpeace spokesman said: 'Climate change is the most important part of our polar story.' The show cost an estimated £16million and took four years to make and has proved hugely popular. It examines various aspects of the polar wilderness over the seasons and follows the lives of creatures from polar bears and wolves in the Arctic to killer whales and Adelie penguins in the Antarctic. It has been produced by the BBC's Natural History Unit in Bristol in conjunction with the Discovery Channel and The Open University. The climate change episode will be aired on December 7 at 9pm.","Climate change particularly sensitive during presidential race .

"Campaigners are calling on the Filipino government to free the country’s only elephant and allow her to be sent to Thailand to spend her final years among her own kin after three decades of solitude. Mali the elephant has spent 35 years in a barren concrete pen at the Manila Zoo without any inter-species contact and only a small pool to entertain her. A celebrity backed PETA campaign is now demanding that the elderly elephant's years of loneliness come to an end and that she is reunited with other elephants at a sanctuary in Thailand. Scroll down for video . On my own: Mali is the only elephant in the Philippines and has been living alone for 33 years . Mali was torn from her mother in Sri Lanka at the age of three and sent to the Philippines as a gift to then-president Ferdinand Marcos in 1977. She has since spent her days in loneliness and boredom in the small enclosure at the zoo in the capital and is reportedly suffering from a number of ailments as a result of her captivity and age. Efforts to 'deport' Mali have increased in recent weeks as more groups have joined the campaign, backed by several celebrities including film diva Brigitte Bardot, artist Morrissey and Nobel laureate J.M Coetzee. They propose the lonely lady be sent to The Thai Elephant Conservation Centre in Lampang province, to be with an estimated 50 elephants in a forest setting. Old and lonely: Mali in the barren concrete pen which has been her home since 1977 when she was sent to the Philippines from Sri Lanka aged 3 . Open wide: Mali is examined by veterinarians brought in by campaigners to establish if the 38-year-old is well enough to travel to the Thai sanctuary . Ill-ephant: Vets found that the elderly elephant suffers from severe depression, as a result of her years of isolation, and also have foot problems which pose a grave risk to her physical health . Former Senator Juan Miguel Zubiri, the convenor of campaign group Pilipinas Ecowarriors, said in a statement to local on Tuesday: ‘Assuming Mali is fit to make the trip to Thailand, she would be better off in a designated sanctuary, rather than kept in a zoo here.’ Friends wanted: Campaigners want Mali to join 50 elephants in Lampang . Representatives from PETA Asia flew in a . specialist elephant physician who concluded that her isolation is . causing Mali ‘intense mental suffering’ and that her physical health is . at risk as a result of her severe foot problems. Philippine President Benigno Aquino personally entered the debate last week. He issued orders to the Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau and the Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal Industry to see if Mali could even travel. The groups have begun asking about animal quarantine in Thailand, and whether Mali could even make the trip. A spokesman for PETA in London said: ‘PETA Asia has been campaigning for an end to Mali's suffering, but has been met with resistance at every step of the way. ‘After receiving a letter from famed . musician Morrissey, Philippines President Benigno Aquino III issued a . directive stating that Mali's health should be evaluated and she should . be considered for transfer to a sanctuary. ‘Following this ground-breaking directive, PETA Asia flew in elephant expert Dr Henry Melvyn Richardson to examine Mali. ‘Dr . Richardson's report indicates that Mali's confinement to a concrete . enclosure has led to severe foot problems - the leading cause of death . among captive elephants. ‘Not . only is Mali's physical health at risk if she continues to stay at an . institution that lacks the resources and knowledge to care for her . properly but her isolation from other elephants is causing her intense . mental suffering.' Although Asian elephants can live to be . up to 60-70 years in freedom, zoo animals rarely pass 20 years of age . due to stress, obesity and lack of exercise. PETA Asia say Mali needs to be retired . ‘without delay’ and reports that the The Thai Elephant Conservation . Centre have offered a place for Mali as soon as the Filipino government . agree on her release.","Mali the elephant is the only one of her kind in the Philippines .

"Ever wondered who can find out where you are and discover what you’re doing by looking at your mobile data? The answer, according to security researcher, Brendan O’Connor, is just about anyone. That is, anyone, who has access to a Raspberry Pi Model A computer, a few over-the-counter sensors and a plastic box. With $57 (£37) Mr O’Connor managed to create a device, named ‘creepyDOL’, which can track the movement of everyone on the street. With £37 Mr O'Connor managed to create a device, that he has named creepyDOL which can track the movement of everyone on the street. The sensors in the device look at all the wireless traffic emitted by every nearby wireless device, including smartphones and tablets . The sensors in the device looked at all the wireless traffic emitted by every nearby wireless device, including smartphones and tablets. He then connected each of the boxes to a command and control system, and constructed a data visualisation system to monitor what the sensors picked up. ‘Actually it’s not hard,’ said Mr O’Connor in a New York Times interview. ‘It’s terrifyingly easy.’ ‘It could be used for anything depending on how creepy you want to be,’ he said. Mr O’Connor found that he could pick up the websites he browsed when he connected to a public Wi-Fi.

He got the unique identifier connected to his mobile and managed to get huge amounts of unencrypted information about where he had been. When he wasn’t connect to a Wi-Fi network, his sensors were still able to track his location through Wi-Fi ‘pings.’ A ping test is used to determine whether your device can communicate with another system over the network. The CreepDOL boxes are small enough to be hidden under a table, or scattered around city streets without being noticed. By placing the sensor boxes near the places a person visits, you can spy on just about anyone. ‘It eliminates the idea of “blending into a crowd”’, said Mr O’Conner. Most people are willing to take their mobile phone wherever they go. According to research by Morgan Stanley, 91 per cent of today people keep their mobile phone within 3 feet of them, 24 hours a day . The FBI is hacking people's mobile devices so that they can turn the mic on and listen in on conversations. This is according to court documents and interviews with people involved, uncovered by the Wall Street Journal. The records show that only members of organised crime, terrorist cells, and child pornographers have sofar been subject to this sort of surveillance. The FBI is also reportedly only using these techniques when 'they have no other choice.' ‘If you have a wireless device (phone, iPad, etc.), even if you’re not connected to a network, CreepyDOL will see you, track your movements, and report home.’ He added that no one can guard against the invasion of privacy, adding that applications leak more information than they should. For instance, a VPN connects to tunnelling software after connecting to a Wi-Fi hub, meaning that at least for a few seconds, their web traffic is known to anyone wants to find out. Alongside this, every Wi-Fi network that your mobile has ever connected to in the past is also stored in the device and can be shared. ‘These are fundamental design flaws in the way pretty much everything works,’ he said. Mr O’Connor is founder of a consulting firm called Malice Afterthought. He is also a law student at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. He told the New York Times that he only used the device to spy on himself due to a law called the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. One of his fellow students, Andrew Auernheimer, was sentenced to 41 months in prison for exploiting a security hole in the computer system of AT&T, which made e-mail addresses accessible for over 100,000 iPad owners. ‘I haven’t done a full deployment of this because the United States government has made a practice of prosecuting security researchers,’ he said in the interview. ‘Everyone is terrified.’","Student Brendan O'Connor said device was 'terrifyingly easy to make'

On Tuesday, the music mogul announced he and his protege had parted company after seven years following a decision made by Syco Records not to renew her contract. Sources close to Miss Lewis, who is still the richest winner of the TV talent show having acquired a fortune of £13million, claim Cowell no longer understood the direction she wanted to take with her music. All change: Simon Cowell (pictured right on Monday) has decided not to renew Leona Lewis' (pictured left on the 2006 show) contract. Sources say the split is down to creative differences . The star was in negotiations with another Sony label, but has now signed a deal with rival . label Island Records, which has artists including Robbie Williams and . rapper Nicki Minaj on its roster. In a statement Miss Lewis said: ‘After seven incredible years at Sony I feel honoured to be given the opportunity to sign to perhaps the most iconic label of all, Island Records. ‘To me Island has always been a label where artists can really flourish and are encouraged to express themselves.’ A music industry source added: 'Syco decided they were not going to make another album with Leona on Syco. There were ‎then discussions with another Sony label, but they didn't work out - and she went to Island.'

"A harrowing video has been posted on online of an 11-year-old Yemeni girl who claims she ran away to escape an arranged marriage. Nada al-Ahdal says she was only saved from the forced engagement after her uncle intervened. 'Go ahead and marry me off - I'll kill myself,' she warns in the video, dated July 8, and posted on YouTube. Scroll down for video . Difficult viewing: A harrowing video has been posted on YouTube of an 11-year-old Yemeni girl explaining how she escaped an arranged marriage . 'Don't they have any compassion?' I'm better off dead. I'd rather die.' She continues: 'It’s not [the kids'] fault. I’m not the only one. It can happen to any child.' 'Some children decided to throw themselves into the sea, they’re dead now. They have killed our dreams, they have killed everything inside us. There’s nothing left. There is no upbringing. This is criminal, this is simply criminal.' In the video filmed in a car, she explains why she does not want to leave her family home saying: 'I would have had no life, no education,' she says in the video. Rescue: Nada al-Ahdal was only saved from the forced engagement after her uncle refused to let her get married . Heartfelt: 'I would have had no life, no education,' she says in the video, dated July 8, and posted on the internet . Strong: The video finishes with her telling her family: I'm done with you, you ruined my dreams' The practice of marrying young girls . is widespread in Yemen and has attracted the attention of international rights . groups seeking to pressure the government to outlaw child marriages. Yemen's gripping poverty plays a role . in hindering efforts to stamp out the practice, as poor families find . themselves unable to say no to bride-prices in the hundreds of dollars . for their daughters. More than a quarter of Yemen's females marry before age 15, according to a report in 2010 by the Social Affairs Ministry. Tribal custom also plays a role, . including the belief that a young bride can be shaped into an obedient . wife, bear more children and be kept away from temptation. In September 2010, a 12-year-old Yemeni child-bride died after struggling for three days in labour to give birth, a local human rights organisation said. Yemen once set 15 as the minimum age for marriage, but parliament annulled that law in the 1990s, saying parents should decide when a daughter marries. The video which can not be independently verified was filmed by the Middle East Media Research Institute - it finishes with her stating: 'I'm done with you, you ruined my dreams.' The schoolgirl. one of eight children, was taken in by her  uncle Abdel Salam al-Ahdal, when she was aged three. But when a  Yemeni expatriate living in . Saudi Arabia asked her parents if he could marry her, they readily agreed. In an interview with National Yemen, . Nada accuses her mother of . arranging the marriage for profit. 'But I'm not an item for sale,' she says. 'I'm a human being and I would rather die than get married at this age.' Nada, has an 18-year-old sister who has already been engaged many times. Her . parents accepted each new proposal and took a partial down payment for a . bride price. They would then postpone the marriage until the groom had accumulated enough money before  ending the engagement and keeping the down payment. Her uncle was horrified his young niece who lived with him, his son and his elderly mother was being married off. He told NOW: 'When I heard about the groom, I panicked. Nada . was not even 11 years old; she was exactly 10 years and 3 months. I . could not allow her to be married off and have her future destroyed, . especially since her aunt was forced to marry at 13 and burnt herself. 'I . did all I could to prevent that marriage. I called the groom and told . him Nada was no good for him. I told him she did not wear the veil and . he asked if things were going to remain like that. I said ‘yes, and I . agree because she chose it. I also told him that she liked singing and . asked if he would remain engaged to her.' Her parents were not happy the engagement was called off and demanded that Nada be returned home to them. But following her return home,  Nada disappeared after her parents tried to marry her off again against her will. When her uncle found her again, he informed authorities and Nada was eventually allowed to return to live with her uncle, her father's brother - she then posted the horrifying video online.

"Boris Johnson has attacked Islamists who want to impose ‘mumbo-jumbo’ sharia law on Britain. The Mayor of London condemned as ‘bunk’ the idea that there was a clash of civilisations and warned against exaggerating the ‘plague’ of militants. Britain should not give the killers the prize they craved most – dividing us through perpetuating the myth of a 'war', he said. Boris Johnson, pictured during a media conference in Woolwich, said Britain should not let the killers divide the country through perpetuating a myth of a 'war' 'This is a sinister political agenda that promotes a sense of grievance and victimhood among a minority of Muslims,’ he wrote in his regular column for the Telegraph. ‘The Islamists want universal sharia law and other mumbo-jumbo. 'Above all, they want power over others and so they prey on young men who feel in some way rejected by society and they fill those young men with a horrible and deluded sense of self-importance.’ He said universities should also stop pandering to extremists by allowing segregated meetings on campus. 'The universities need to be much, much . tougher in monitoring Islamic societies. It is utterly wrong to have . segregated meetings in a state-funded centre of learning,' he said. 'If visiting speakers start some . Islamist schtick - and seek to call for or justify violence - then the . authorities need to summon the police.' The Mayor of London said there must be a distinction between the religion of Islam and 'virus of Islamism' Islamist preachers like Abu Qatada should be deported, according to Johnson . He added that inciters like Abu Qatada 'should be put on a plane' and those that preach hate and violence must be arrested. Mr Johnson said there needed to be a  distinction between Islam – which gave enrichment to millions of peaceful people – and the ‘virus of Islamism’. Islamist evangelists had no allegiance to Western society 'whose benefits systems they abuse'. 'Their avowed intent is to create a sexist and homophobic caliphate.' And in a challenge to political apologists - including former mayor Ken Livingstone - he warned against playing the extremists' game by examining British foreign policy to look for reasons for terrorism. 'You cannot hope to solve the problem . of Islamism by accepting their invitation to enter into some debate or . discussion about British or American foreign policy, even if that were . desirable. People who suggest as much are, alas, playing the game of the . Islamists.' He warned . against 'exaggerating' the 'plague' of Islamists, saying they probably . numbered in the low thousands yet there were one million Muslims in . London alone. 'You can see how the reputation of a whole community is at risk of suffering from the actions of a tiny, tiny fraction.' It . was a 'fitting rebuttal of the ghastly sexism of Islamist ideology' that one of the firearms squad who immobilised one of the alleged . killers had been a woman.","Mayor of London condemned idea of a clash of civilisations .

"Phone, wallet, keys – it’s the usual mental checklist many of us go through before leaving  the house. But remembering the keys could soon be redundant thanks to a new mobile phone app. The app, called Kwikset Kevo, securely stores electronic versions of keys for multiple locks on a smartphone or tablet. Scroll down for video . The Kwikset Kevo app, pictured, lets users unlock their front door using just their phone. The app connects to a Bluetooth enabled lock, right, which means doors can be unlocked wirelessly, without having to get a phone out of a pocket or bag. The user just needs to touch the lock to get the door to open . Kwikset Kevo works in a similar way to the August lock announced in the U.S earlier this year. It runs on two AA batteries and a reminder is sent to the owner when the battery levels get low. Once installed the homeowner activates their device. The August lock can then be managed using a mobile app and online. The encrypted locking technology issues registered devices, or invited devices, with unique codes that can't be copied. To open the lock, anyone with a code . can approach the door, enable their phone's Bluetooth and press the . relevant address from the app. The lock takes a few seconds to scan for a paired Bluetooth device. It then confirms the visitor's identity. When a user approaches a saved location, . such as an office or a house, the phone can wirelessly unlock the door . using Bluetooth meaning users only have to touch a lock to open a door . and don't even need to remove the device from their pocket. The app is currently only available for iOS devices but the company said it is working on Android and BlackBerry versions. To convert a door into a Kwikset-enabled door, users need to buy and install new deadbolt locks on all the doors they wish to use with the app. Kwikset Kevo costs £144 and this includes these new locks. Once enabled, users can send eKeys . to friends and family, allowing them to gain access to premises on . either a permanent or temporary basis. To prevent unauthorised access, the app can detect whether a user is already inside, for example, using GPS before granting access and each individual user can be uniquely identified. The locks are supplied with . a physical key so users can gain access if their phone battery runs . flat or they wish to go out without it. Fobs are also included in the Kwikset Kevo pack for children who don't have a smartphone, or for people who don't have an iOS device. The Kevo smart lock package costs £144 and includes one deadbolt as well as two eKeys that can be sent to friends and family. The deadbolt comes in three finishes including Satin Nickel, Venetian Bronze and Polished Brass, pictured . The Kevo pack also comes with a fob and two traditional keys for people without smartphones, or in case their phone battery dies . The locks rely on a Bluetooth connection, which is the technology used by many wireless hands-free phone kits. Makers Hardware and Home Improvement say 79 per cent of people aged 18 to 44 now have their smartphone on them for at least 22 hours a day. The company believe users will appreciate not having to carry around a bunch of keys everywhere they go. Greg Gluchowski, from HHI, said: 'Kevo is the first deadbolt intelligent enough to communicate with a smartphone and unlock with a simple touch. 'This technology is so convenient that users do not even need to remove the smartphone from their pocket or purse when unlocking their door. 'Kevo is a game-changing door lock that uses modern technology and the convenience of touch to evolve the traditional key. It has never been done before.' Phil Dumas, from UniKey, which worked alongside HHI, added: 'By uniquely combining existing mobile and Bluetooth technologies, we’re bringing your front door into the digital age without compromising the look or security of the lock.' The Kevo smart lock package includes one deadbolt, one fob, two mechanical keys and two smartphone eKeys. The deadbolt comes in three finishes including Satin Nickel, Venetian Bronze and Polished Brass. Kevo operates on four included AA batteries, which the company claims should last for a year depending on usage.","Kwikset Kevo app securely stores electronic keys for multiple door locks .

"Disgraced teacher Debra Lafave, the woman convicted of having sex with a 14-year-old student is officially back on probation amid protests from the victim's family. The 32-year-old was dealt a ten-year suspended sentence in 2005 for a string of sexual encounters with a pupil at Angelo L. Greco Middle School in Temple Terrace, Florida. But the punishment was frozen by a retiring judge to allow her to help care for her newborn twin sons as well as her cancer-stricken mother in 2011. On Thursday, however, she was put back under Federal supervision to see out the remaining four years and two months of her sentence. Scroll down for video . Reinstated: Former Florida teacher Debra LaFave who pleaded guilty in 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old student, was ordered back on probation on Thursday . Too lenient: In 2011 a retiring judge offered leniency to Lafave releasing her from her seven-year probation before it was later deemed an 'abuse of judicial power' Speaking alongside her parents yesterday, the now mother-of-twins said: 'My mom was diagnosed with cancer for . the second time, and I spent my year off probation taking care of her . and I'm so fortunate that I was able to take her to chemo treatments and . spend the nights with her when she needed me the most.' Lafave's striking looks made her a household name in 2005 after she was convicted of two counts of lewd and lascivious battery, barely more than a year after she married. The story took a bizarre twist after John Gillespie, the lead detective in her case, was arrested before the trial in an unrelated prostitution sting, while Tampa Bay Police officers were probed when it was revealed they took graphic nude photos of Lafave while she was in stirrups in a jail cell. Attention grabbing: Lefave's crimes drew national attention after provocative images taken of her before teaching, like this one, were released . In 2009, once she completed sex . offender therapy, a judge allowed her to have contact with her . relative's children, though she was still banned from living within . 1,000 feet of where children congregate. Lafave later went on national . television to explain her actions, attributing her indiscretions to . bipolar disorder, hyper-sexuality and poor judgement during manic . episodes. Her ex husband,  Owen Lafave, left her and also appeared on a number of chat shows, before she remarried and gave birth to twins. In 2011 a retiring judge offered . leniency to Lafave - who is now using her maiden name Beasley - but in a . move an appellate court later ruled to have been an ‘abuse of judicial . power.’ But before the . judge made that ruling, a sister of Lafave's victim - who is now 23 - . said her brother's mental health has been devastated. Her voice shaking, . the sister was allowed to testify after giving only her initials. 'This . is something that has consumed his life,' she said, adding that her . brother remained under psychiatric care and was himself opposed to an . early end to her probation. Circuit . Judge Lisa Campbell reinstated Lafave's probation on Thursday to finish . the remainder of her sentence of four years and two months. Rules apply: LaFave, pictured beside her attorney and mother in blue, must stay away from schools and has a curfew set from 10pm to 6am . Staying close: Lafave said she was thankful for her time off her probation with it allowing her to spend more time with her mother, pictured, who was diagnosed with cancer for the second time . She . also reinstated her curfew from 10pm to 6am and said the former teacher . must stay away from schools as well as her former victim she met while . teaching at Angelo L. Greco Middle School in . Temple Terrace, Florida. She was charged with two counts of . felonies after pleading guilty to having sexual intercourse and oral sex . on four different occasions with the boy - one of which was at the school. Lafave was reported by the boy's mother in May of 2004 and was immediately arrested. The disgraced teacher avoided jail entirely, despite facing up to 30 years behind bars if convicted. She was then sentenced to only seven years probation and three years house arrest. LaFave's attorney on Thursday said they don't plan to give up after appealing to the state's highest court. ‘It's been eight and a half years now and the case is still not over,’ John Fitzgibbons told the Times. 'We're hopeful that we will receive a favorable ruling within the next six months to a year from the supreme court and then that should finally conclude things.’ Exiting the courthouse Lafave’s mother gave a thumbs up to reporters’ cameras while trailing behind her daughter. Asked how she’s feeling she said: ‘Fantastic. God is good.’ Lafave, . who garnered nationwide interest for her striking looks and provocative . modelling shots after she committed the crime, is banned from ever . teaching in Florida again.

"A man who converted from Islam to Christianity is facing the death penalty in Iran for refusing to return to his former religion. Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani, 34, of the Church of Iran, faces hanging after refusing a court order to renounce his Christian faith. If the execution goes ahead it would be the first Christian to be officially executed in Iran for religious reasons in 20 years. The pastor had defied a request by the Gilan provincial court, in the Iranian city of Rasht, to repent ahead of today's hearing. Facing execution Youcef Nadarkhani with his wife and two children in an undated photograph circulated by religious rights organisations . Despite assurances that Nadarkhani's case will be sent back to Iran's Supreme Court, his supporters fear the provincial court will use a law, temporarily ratified by parliament, to execute him this week. The married father-of-two was detained in his home city of Rasht in October 2009, while attempting to register his church. Supporters of the pastor say he was arrested after questioning the Muslim monopoly on the religious instruction of children in Iran. Foreign Secretary William Hague has urged Iran to spare Nadarkhani's life by overturning his sentence. Mr Hague said: 'I deplore reports . that Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani, an Iranian Church leader, could be . executed imminently after refusing an order by the Supreme Court of Iran . to recant his faith. 'This demonstrates the Iranian . regime's continued unwillingness to abide by its constitutional and . international obligations to respect religious freedom. 'I pay tribute to the courage shown . by Pastor Nadarkhani, who has no case to answer, and call on the Iranian . authorities to overturn his sentence.' Church officials say there may be as . many as 100,000 devoted Christians in the country and that Iran's . leadership is concerned about the spread of Christianity. Nadarkhani . was initially charged with protesting, but charges against him were . later changed to 'apostasy' - or abandoning Islam - and 'evangelising . Muslims', which both carry the death sentence. He was later tried and found guilty of apostasy in September 2010, and sentenced to death by the court in the city of Rasht. In . June this year the Supreme Court of Iran upheld the death sentence but . asked the lower court in Rasht, which issued the initial sentence, to . re-examine whether or not he had been a practicing Muslim adult prior to . converting to Christianity. Nadarkhani told the court during his first hearing on Sunday that he had no intention of returning to Islam. He said: 'Repent means to return. What should I return to? To the blasphemy that I had before my faith in Christ?' However, the court said that because Nadarkhani has Islamic ancestry, he therefore must 'recant his faith in Jesus Christ'. When the court ordered him to 'return to the religion of your ancestors - Islam', Nadarkhani replied: 'I can not.' Jason . DeMars, of advocacy group Present Truth Ministries, said: 'This law . dictates what should be done with apostates, depending on what type of . apostasy has been committed. 'My sources tell me that the court has been told to give the ""apostate"" three days to recant, then execute him.' Mr DeMar added that section 6.225 of Iran's controversial legislation says that if a person's parents were Muslims at the time they were trying to conceive a child, and that converts to another religion and renounces Islam, he or she would be a national apostate. He said: 'The death sentence is the penalty for national apostate, but after the verdict is pronounced, he or she will be commanded to repent of what he or she has done. 'If he refuses to repent, he will be killed.' The written verdict of the Supreme Court's decision also included a provision for annulment of the death sentence if Pastor Nadarkhani recanted his faith. Although the court found that Pastor Nadarkhani was not a practicing Muslim adult, the court said he remained guilty of apostasy because he had Muslim ancestry. Nadarkhani's lawyer, Mohammed Ali Dadkhah, told the court that the repeated demand for his client to recant his Christian faith violated Iranian law and its constitution. The last Iranian Christian convert from Islam executed by the Iranian government was Assemblies of God Pastor Hossein Soodmand in 1990. However, several other Christians, including at least six Protestant pastors, are reported to have been assassinated in Iran by unknown killers in recent years. Mr Ali Dadkhah said he was hopeful an appeals court would acquit his client. He said there was a '95 per cent chance' of acquittal. Nadarkhani turned to Christianity when he was 19.","'Repent means to return. What should I return to? To the blasphemy that I had before my faith in Christ?'

"With women obliged to sit yards behind chairs reserved exclusively for men, the photograph below shows the shocking reality of gender segregation at a British university. It was taken earlier this year at a training course at Leicester University organised by its Islamic Society. The course was entitled Call Of Duty and it featured a guest speaker from a hardline Islamic group. Rupert Sutton of campaign group Student Rights, which monitors campus extremism, said: ‘The obvious discrimination in this picture is what segregated seating can mean in practice – women pushed to the back of the hall, while men are given the best seats to see and hear the speaker.’ PICTURE EXCLUSIVE: Women and men sit separately at a day-long seminar at Leicester University earlier this year - which was about how to 'talk to non Muslims about Islam convincingly and in a structured way' The disturbing image emerged at the end of a week in which Universities UK – the vice-chancellors’ association – backed down from guidelines it had previously given that apparently allowed campus Islamic societies to impose segregated seating at meetings. The guidelines have been withdrawn while Universities UK consults with the Equality and Human Rights Commission about the appropriate position. It is expected to be forced to back down permanently. A recent report by Student Rights found that over a quarter of visits by Islamic speakers to British universities resulted in segregated meetings. Last week the controversy over gender segregation prompted the Prime Minister to intervene. Mr Cameron said: ‘I’m absolutely clear that there should not be segregated audiences for visiting speakers to universities in Britain. That is not the right approach, the guidance should say that universities should not allow this.’ The Leicester University event in February was billed as a ‘Dawah Training Course’. Dawah is the word Muslims use to mean ‘preaching’ or ‘invitation to Islam’. Inequality: The women sit at the back, left, while the men are given the best seats closest to the front, right . Defence: Guest speaker Saleem Chagtai said: 'Separate seating for men and women is not something we ever enforce. It happens naturally and if Muslim women were disadvantaged they would be the first to complain' It was held on a Sunday in the oak-panelled Queen’s Hall and featured guest speaker Saleem Chagtai from the Islamic Education and Research Academy (IERA). Mr Chagtai said: ‘Separate seating for men and women is not something we ever enforce. ‘It happens naturally and if Muslim women were disadvantaged they would be the first to complain. They are forthright, not meek and mild as those who do not understand Islam assume. ‘This photo must have been taken at the start of the meeting because by the end there were many more women at the talk. ‘We have consulted with Liberty and the Equalities and Human Rights Commission to ensure that we stay within the law and we do this by providing a mixed seating area for those who prefer this. ‘I think David Cameron has failed to do his homework. He is trying to make capital out of a problem that isn’t there.’ Criticised: The training course on Islam preaching happened in February at the University of Leicester . Soon after this photograph was taken, the IERA was barred from University College London for segregating seating at a debate over the existence of God. Several of its leading figures have a history of making intolerant comments against free speech and in favour of brutal punishments for homosexuals and ‘fornicators’. IERA was invited back to Leicester University a month after the Call Of Duty course for a debate called Does God Exist? Photographs of that event emerged showing signs pointing males (brothers) and females (sisters) to different entrances. It prompted the university authorities to investigate after they were alerted that its own Islamic Society boasted of operating ‘a strict policy of segregated seating between males and females’. At the time, university officials insisted that they did not permit enforced segregation and there would be ‘no recurrence’. Brothers and sisters: The picture comes after this sign was put up at a public lecture hosted by the University of Leicester's Islamic society, which academic authorities said they would investigate . Last night there was no comment from Leicester University’s Islamic Society. A spokesman for the university said: ‘The university expects all persons to respect its commitment to freedom of speech, its good name and reputation and to be sensitive  to the feelings of all sections of its diverse community. ‘We will be in discussions with Universities UK following their most recent statement to clarify the impact of their legal advice.’","Photograph was taken earlier this year at a Leicester University seminar .

"The prime suspect in the murder of Alice Gross killed himself in woodland where he may have lived after first travelling to Britain. The badly decomposed body of Arnis Zalkalns, 41, was found hanged in a dense copse of trees in an isolated 'no go' area of west London's Boston Manor Park. The grim discovery in a part of the park used for shelter by Eastern Europeans for years ended the Europe-wide manhunt for the convicted murderer, who is the only suspect in the death of 14-year-old Alice.  A post-mortem examination will begin on his body today. Meanwhile detectives are keen to speak to a mystery teenager who was spotted with Zalkalns just hours after the schoolgirl went missing on August 28. Scroll down for video . Police guard the woodland in Boston Manor Park today where the body of suspect Arnis Zalkalns was found . The body was found in an isolated patch of woodland where Eastern Europeans have been known to live . Isolated: This blue screen guarding the spot where Zalkalns' body was found in a deeply wooded area . The badly decomposed body of Arnis Zalkalns, 41, was found hanged in a dense copse of trees that he is believed to have once called home. Above, his corpse is removed in a body bag on Sunday . The grim discovery ended the Europe-wide manhunt for the convicted murderer, who is the only suspect in the death of 14-year-old Alice (left) The boy, believed to be about 14 or 15, was said to have been with the prime suspect in an off licence in Ealing, west London, the day she disappeared. Shopkeeper Fereydoon Alavi, who is in his 50s, said the unknown teenager went into the Corner Shop and tried to buy alcohol before being accompanied by Zalkalns. He said: 'He was here with a teenage boy - I think it was August 28, in the afternoon/evening time. 'The boy tried to buy cider but he didn't have ID so I didn't serve him.  He then went outside and asked the man to come in for him. 'He seemed out of it, he was very jumpy, like he was on drugs.  He was unshaven, scruffy, and smelt - it was just suspicious. 'The boy came in first. He asked to buy cider but I refused him when he had no ID. 'Then the other man came in, he bought the cider. He seemed out of it. He was unshaven, scruffy and smelly. The whole thing was suspicious.' Mr Alavi, who also said the man appeared suspiciously 'hyper', said the boy had the 'beginnings of a beard', was of Asian appearance and 'looked like he had been sleeping outside'. The shopkeeper said he was visited by police in mid-September, and confirmed to them that he had seen Zalkalns, before giving them his CCTV of the man's visit to his shop in The Avenue, Ealin. Yesterday the suspect's body was cut down as dozens of specialist officers scoured the park for clues . Police said the corpse was 'badly decomposed', raising the prospect that it has been there since he went missing a week after Alice vanished. Above, an ambulance arrives to remove the body . It comes as police continue to face a barrage of searching questions over their handling of the ill-fated inquiry in which the victim's body was only found after weeks of searching. As residents expressed disbelief that the huge police operation failed to find the missing Latvian more quickly: . Detectives want to speak to a mystery teenage boy who was spotted with Zalkalns at the Corner Shop in Ealing, west London (pictured), just hours after 14-year-old schoolgirl Alice went missing on August 28 . The corpse was found in parkland which is a popular haunt for Eastern European immigrant rough sleepers. Above, forensics officers arrive at a tent erected at the scene in Boston Manor Park where the body was found . Yesterday the suspect's body was cut down as dozens of specialist officers scoured the park for clues. The investigation is far from over despite the death of the only suspect. Detectives face months of painstaking forensic work to piece together Arnis Zalkalns' final days. The investigation will run parallel to the one examining the body of Alice Gross and the materials used to hide her corpse. Police will compile their evidence and pass it to the Crown Prosecution Service. Senior lawyers will consider the case, and are then likely to announce whether it would have been strong enough to mount a prosecution. In the short term, tests will ascertain how Alice died and a post-mortem examination of Zalkalns is expected to begin today. But it could be many months before a full public inquest can draw a line under the crime. Police said the corpse was 'badly decomposed', raising the prospect that it has been there since he went missing a week after Alice vanished. It was found in parkland which is a popular haunt for Eastern European immigrant rough sleepers. Zalkalns' family said he used his military training to live rough for weeks when he moved to London in 2007. Those who knew the Latvian think he may have stayed in the park, and it remained one of his favourite places. His former landlord Radoslav Andric, 64, said: 'He was a loner, he used to ride his bike around the park a lot. This park was like his escape from society. I believe that the last time I saw him he was on his way to the park.' The park runs alongside the Grand Union Canal, a mile from where Alice was last captured on CCTV. Locals described an isolated part where immigrants erect shelters as a 'no go' area. Linda Massey, from Friends of Boston Manor Park, said police searched the area a week ago. She added: 'We have rough sleepers in the park but the police did check all the tents. They're mainly Eastern Europeans.' Police cordoned off the area yesterday following the discovery of the body of a man in Boston Manor Park . On September 28 uniformed officers were seen searching the same area. It is not known how long the body has been in the woods though it was said to be 'badly decomposed' Residents said the isolated 'no go' area of west London's Boston Manor Park has been used for shelter by Eastern Europeans for many years. Above, police search the site in Boston Manor Park . Local cafe owner Alex Khan said: 'He wasn't right, he was a very big weirdo. He would sometimes come in, order a coffee and say he liked to see the pretty little girls. 'It would always be between the hours that schools kicked out then he'd walk up to the park where they would all hang out.' It is thought that no suicide note was found, but detectives have CCTV of Zalkalns withdrawing money the day before he vanished. He sent some of it to his former mother-in-law in Latvia. On the weekend, Zalkalns' girlfriend, Katerina Laiblova, 39, complained that police took nine days to investigate after she reported him missing. And last night, Zalkalns' sister said police had not yet contacted her family to say they had found his body. MP Mr Pound, who has been supporting Alice's family at their Hanwell home, said: 'Police now have some serious questions to answer. However my first thoughts are with Alice Gross's family.' Those who knew the Latvian think he may have stayed in the park, and it remained one of his favourite places .

'I don't think it makes a whole lot of difference anymore which . political party is running things. Nothing gets done,' said Roy . Gustafson, 61, of Camden, South Carolina, who lives on disability . payments. 'The state would be better off handling things on its own.' Scottish unionists won by a wider-than-expected 10-percentage-point margin. Falling public approval of the Obama administration, attention to the . Scottish vote and the success of activists who accuse the U.S. government of overstepping its authority - such as the self-proclaimed . militia members who flocked to Nevada's Bundy ranch earlier this year . during a standoff over grazing rights - is driving up interest in . secession, experts said. 'It seems to have heated up, especially . since the election of President Obama,' said Mordecai Lee, a professor . of governmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, who . has studied secessionist movements. Republicans were more inclined to support the idea, with 29.7 per cent favoring it compared with 21 per cent of Democrats.

"Toxins possibly from algae on Lake Erie fouled the water supply of the state's fourth-largest city on Saturday, forcing officials to issue warnings not to drink the water and the governor to declare a state of emergency as worried residents descended on stores, quickly clearing shelves of bottled water. 'It looked like Black Friday,' said Aundrea Simmons, who stood in a line of about 50 people at a pharmacy before buying four cases of water. 'I have children and elderly parents. They take their medication with water.' The city advised about 400,000 residents in Toledo, most of its suburbs and a few areas in southeastern Michigan not to brush their teeth with or boil the water because that would only increase the toxin's concentration. The mayor also warned that children should not shower or bathe in the water and that it shouldn't be given to pets. Scroll down for video . Stocking up: Aundrea Simmons stands next to her minivan with cases of bottled water she bought after Toledo warned residents not to use its water . Toledo issued the warning just after midnight after tests at one treatment plant showed two sample readings for microsystin above the standard for consumption. Algae blooms during the summer have become more frequent and troublesome around the western end of Lake Erie, the shallowest of the five Great Lakes. The algae growth is fed by phosphorous mainly from farm fertilizer runoff and sewage treatment plants, leaving behind toxins that have contributed to oxygen-deprived dead zones where fish can't survive. The toxins can kill animals and sicken humans. Scientists had predicted a significant bloom of the blue-green algae this year, but they didn't expect it to peak until early September. Gov. John Kasich's emergency order issued Saturday allowed the state to begin bringing water into the Toledo area. Large containers were being filled with water at a prison near Columbus and trucked about 130 miles north to Toledo, said Joe Andrews, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Public Safety. The state also asked major grocery chains to divert as much water as they can to northwest Ohio, Andrews said. Cant drink tap water: Sharon Green loads bottled water into her car she bought after Toledo warned residents not to use its water . As truckloads of water came in from . across the state, Toledo leaders set up distribution centers at schools . around the city, limiting families to one case of bottled water. Some . stores were receiving new shipments of water and putting limits on how . much people can buy. 'We're going to be prepared to make sure people are not without water,' said Toledo Mayor D. Michael Collins. He . said the city hopes to know Saturday night how long the warning will . stay in place, and he pleaded with residents not to panic. There were no . reports yet of people becoming sick from drinking the water, Collins . said. Sample of water were . flown to the federal and state Environmental Protection Agency offices . in Cincinnati and Columbus and a university in Michigan for additional . testing, officials said. Police officers were called to stores as residents lined up to buy bottled water, bags of ice and flavored water. 'People . were hoarding it. It's ridiculous,' said Monica Morales, who bought . several cases of bottled water before the store sold out of water a . half-hour after opening. Stores . in cities up to 50 miles away were reporting shortages of bottled . water. Some neighboring communities that aren't connected to Toledo's . water system were offering their water to people who brought their own . bottles and containers. Operators . of water plants all along Lake Erie, which supplies drinking water for . 11 million people, have been concerned over the last few years about . toxins fouling their supplies. Almost . a year ago, one township just east of Toledo told its 2,000 residents . not to drink or use the water coming from their taps. That was believed . to be the first time a city has banned residents from using the water . because of toxins from algae in the lake. Most . water treatment plants along the western Lake Erie shoreline treat . their water to combat the algae. Toledo spent about $4 million last year . on chemicals to treat its water and combat the toxins.","Toxins possibly from algae on Lake Erie fouled the water supply of Toledo, Ohio .

"President Barack Obama is the 'weakest' U.S. president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, according to former Vice President Dick Cheney. Speaking Wednesday night on Fox News, the 73-year-old Republican said the rest of the world – especially in the Middle East – has lost respect for the United States under Obama's leadership. 'I think the perception around the world is increasingly negative, Sean' he told host Sean Hannity, 'but I think the main focus is on our president.' 'He's a very, very weak president, maybe the weakest – certainly in my lifetime.' Dick Cheney slammed the Obama administration for its handling of the Middle East: 'We've got a problem with weakness. It's centered right in the White House.' Foreign policy: Obama said Wednesday that the U.S. will move toward a complete withdrawal from Afghanistan and rely more on NATO and the UN to help practice 'American leadership' Foreign powers 'all are absolutely convinced that the American capacity to lead and influence in that part of the world has been dramatically reduced by this president,' he claimed. 'We've got a problem with weakness. It's centered right in the White House.' During a commencement speech Wednesday at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Obama confirmed his plans to pull most of the remaining U.S. troops out of Afghanistan. He also emphasized American reliance on international coalitions like NATO and the UN as 'American strength, American leadership.' 'He's prepared to pull out, at this . point, all of our capability in Afghanistan and not negotiate a . stay-behind agreement,' Cheney responded. 'That’s stupid, unwise and will in . fact just reinforce the notion that we're weak and that we have a . president that doesn't understand his obligations.' The former vice president, who served under President George W. Bush for two terms, said Obama is 'totally ignoring' why the U.S. invaded Afghanistan. 'It’s as though he wasn't even around when 9/11 happened,' he said. Not up to snuff: Former VP Dick Cheney said Obama is the weakest U.S. president since FDR . The former VP told Fox News host Sean Hannity that Obama's planned Afghanistan withdrawal is 'stupid' and 'unwise' Hannity noted that the president has 'given three speeches in three days about the military,' and checked off a list of foreign affairs and military scandals that he said the president hasn't adequately addressed. 'We've outed a CIA operative in Afghanistan, we have a VA scandal that is breathtaking in terms of how inappropriate it is for our vets,' he said. The VA scandal is an 'outrage,' Cheney said, mocking the White House and senior congressional Democrats for blaming the agency's health care crisis on him and Bush. It has been 'six years out since we left office,' he fumed, 'and we are still blamed by Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama for their current troubles.' The White House did not respond to a request for comment.","Cheney, born in 1941, put Obama at the bottom of the list for presidential strength since FDR .

"The U.S. health secretary has turned down appeals to overrule a federal regulation that could save the life of a 10-year girl who desperately needs a lung transplant or faces dying in the next three to five weeks. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius described her decision as ‘incredibly agonizing’ when she told a congressional panel on Tuesday that she won't intervene in a transplant decision to save a dying Pennsylvania girl. Sarah Murnaghan doesn’t qualify for an adult lung transplant until the age of 12, according to federal regulations, Sebelius has the authority to waive that rule on her behalf. Scroll down for video . Battle: Ten-year-old Sarah Murnaghan has been on the waiting list for a lung transplant for 18 months . 'She [Sebelius] said ""Oh I'm so sorry I know this isn't what you wanted to hear,'"" Sarah’s distraught mom Janet told Fox45 after hearing of Sebelius’ verdict. 'It is in her legal authority. We're going to let a kid die over red tape. Somebody needs to stand up and say this isn't right. This is a human issue this isn't politics.’ Sarah has been hospitalized at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia for three months with end-stage cystic fibrosis and is on a ventilator. Her family wants all children younger than 12 to be eligible for adult lungs because so few pediatric lungs are available. Under current policy, only patients 12 and over can join the list. But Sarah's transplant doctors say she is medically eligible for an adult lung. 'Incredibly agonizing': U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told a congressional panel on Tuesday that she wouldn't overrule federal regulations to help save young Janet . Emotional: Before Wednesday's reprieve Mom Janet had said she refused to tell her young daughter just how sick she really is . The change would add perhaps 20 children from ages 8 to 11 to the adult waiting list, which has more than 1,600 people on it, according to Sharon Ruddock, Sarah's aunt. She said Sebelius' remarks confused the family because they want a policy change for all pre-adolescent children awaiting lung transplants, not just Sarah. ‘One moment they say we're asking for an exception for Sarah. The next moment they say we're asking for sweeping changes and it has to be studied’ Ruddock said Tuesday. Sebelius has called for a review of pediatric transplant policies, but the Murnaghans say Sarah doesn't have time for that. The issue has also become a political football, on Tuesday House Republicans accused Sebelius of refusing to save Sarah at a House Education and the Workforce Committee hearing on her department's budget. ‘I'm begging you. ... She has three to five weeks to live. Please suspend the rules,’ Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., urged Sebelius. Sebelius conceded the case was an 'incredibly agonizing situation' but said many complex factors go into the transplant-list formula . There is 'so much bullcrap around this . place, and we have the chance to save someone’s life - there’s no logic . to this,' an agitated Barletta said, as he and Sebelius at times talked . over each other. 'It simply takes your signature,' Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., a former doctor and one of the Republican Party’s . most active House members on health policy, told Sebelius. Price said the policy review will take 'a year' to complete - too long to be of any help to Sarah Murnaghan. 'This young lady will be dead,' Price said. Sebelius conceded the case was an . ‘incredibly agonizing situation’ but said many complex factors go into . the transplant-list formula. ‘The . medical evidence and the transplant doctors who are making the rule - . and have had the rule in place since 2005 making a delineation between . pediatric and adult lungs, because lungs are different that other organs . - that it’s based on the survivability [chances].’ Sebelius reminded Barletta that 40 people in Pennsylvania are on the ‘highest acuity list’ for lung transplants. Fears: Janet and Fran Murnaghan filed an emergency motion for the temporary restraining order on Wednesday morning, the day after U.S. health secretary Sebelius had turned down their appeals . Researchers have less data on lung transplants in pre-adolescents because only about 20 a year are done. And young children suffer from different lung diseases, making it harder to weigh their risk versus their chance of surviving a transplant, according to a letter to Sebelius from Dr. John P. Roberts, president of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Amid concerns about the higher mortality rate in pediatric patients waiting for lung transplants, the network has tweaked its policies in recent years, Roberts said. The new rules give the younger children priority over adults when adolescent lungs become available and give the sickest children priority in a 1,000-mile radius, a broader range than used in the adult system, he said in the letter, which was shared by the office of Rep. Patrick Meehan, R-Pa. Meehan, in a letter to Sebelius, said Sarah's doctors are confident they can perform a successful transplant on her. And he said she would jump to the top of the adult list if placed there, given the stage of her disease. Ruddock, the aunt, called it ‘a question of morality’ that children get a place in the adult line, given that a far higher percentage of children die waiting for pediatric lungs than do adults on that waiting list. ‘Do you put them at the back of the line if you're not sure how to measure (their potential outcome)? Or do you put them in the line?’ she said. Sisterly: Despite her poor prognosis, Sarah remains upbeat about her chances of getting a transplant . Celebration: Sarah and her mom Janet are celebrating after a federal judge overruled a law preventing children under 12 from receiving adult organs . The system determining who is allocated lungs for transplants was overhauled in 2004 and again in 2008. Doctors claim the changes have allowed fewer people on the waiting list to die. The changes meant that lung transplants are allocated by age groups. Those over the age of 12 are given an allocation score based on how urgently they need a transplant and the severity of their medical condition. Those who would benefit most are placed highest and given first priority. For children under 12, lungs are only allocated based on the time they've spent on the list. One problem is that there are few pediatric lungs available for transplant. In 2012, there were just 10 transplants for Sarah's age group, but more than 1,700 for adults,  according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. On Sunday Janet and Fran Murnaghan asked the public directly for a lung donation to help save their daughter's life. 'Essentially, Sarah has been left to die,' Sarah's parents said in the statement. Sarah, . from Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, was born with cystic fibrosis and . she now lives at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia as her lungs . continue to deteriorate. She . relies on a ventilator to breathe and has been on the waiting list for . new lungs for 18 months - and is top of the priority list for children . in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia . and northern Virginia. Her parents learned just weeks ago . that Sarah would be given a better chance if she were waiting for adult . lungs, which are reserved for people aged 12 or over. 'It shouldn't be about their age,' she told CNN. 'If she's the sickest person, she should qualify.' 'The law is, in my view, age discrimination,' she added to the Philadelphia Inquirer. 'I don't know if this is too late to make a difference for Sarah. But we'll keep fighting it.' Dr. Stuart Sweet from St. Louis Children's . Hospital, who helped write the pediatric transplant system, said the case 'tugs at his heart' but that no system is perfect. He said that if he changed the system for Sarah's advantage, 'there's . another patient, very likely an adolescent, who gets a disadvantage'. 'We've built a system that tries to be as fair to everyone as possible,' he contended. Her parents are hopeful that the issue can be beaten by someone stepping forward with a direct donation to Sarah. Support: Sarah, who has been living in hospital since February, is pictured with her three younger siblings . For now, they have decided not to tell Sarah, who is the eldest of four siblings, just how sick she is. 'I'm not going to tell her she's dying, because she's 10,' Janet told CNN. 'I'm going to tell her we're going to keep fighting. I don't want to scare her.' Sarah, who has been outside just twice in the last 100 days, said that she misses school, where she could 'at least try and act like all the other normal children'. But even as her lungs deteriorate, the young girl remains positive, certain that she will beat her illness and be granted a lung transplant. 'We will [get them]!' she said. 'I can't wait to take my first breath with new lungs. I can close my eyes right now and imagine it... I'm never going to quit! Never, never!' Holding on: Sarah's mother said her eldest daughter has just three to five weeks left to live .","Doctors say Sarah Murnaghan, 10, will die in three to five weeks unless she gets a lung transplant .

"Prosecuted: Rosie-Ann Stone has been charged with causing the death of her sister Jennie through careless driving . A 20-year-old woman crashed into another car killing the driver only to discover the victim was her sister, a court has heard. Rosie-Ann Stone was not told until after the incident that the woman who died in the accident was her older sibling Jennie. Jennie, a final-year student at the . University of Lincoln’s Hull campus, was driving a Peugeot 206 . towards Bridlington when it collided with a Vauxhall Astra being . driven by her younger sister Rosie-Ann. The car then crashed into a tree. Jennie had just dropped her son Charlie, then aged nine, at Skipsea Primary School. Rosie-Ann did not know her sister Jennie was on the same stretch of road when the crash happened. The pair were driving back from Skipsea, East Yorkshire, where Rosie-Ann had been helping her sister get ready to move house. Rosie-Ann . is accused of failing to look in her mirror and pulling out to overtake . when it was not safe to do so but has pleaded not guilty to a charge of . causing death by careless driving. Speaking . at Bridlington Magistrates’ Court as Rosie-Ann made her first . appearance, prosecutor Clive Jones said: ‘Issues of this type are always . difficult to deal with, they’re always tragic with no winners, only . losers. ‘This particular case is doubly . tragic because there were two cars involved and the driver of the other . car was the older sister of Rosie. ‘No doubt unknown to Rosie, her sister was also in that queue of slow-moving vehicles.’ Rosie-Ann elected to be tried by jury at Hull Crown Court and was granted unconditional bail until Thursday, September 5.

Mrs Stone, 56, has spoken of the decision to prosecute her daughter. She said: 'Have our family not lost enough already? It is like being trapped in a bad, bad dream.' 'Even Jennie’s son Charlie knew Rosie . was in the other car and he said to us ""I don’t want anything to happen . to you, Rosie. I don’t want you to go to court and get in trouble"". Heartbreak: Tributes to Jennie Stone were left at the scene where she died on the A165 . Their mother Mrs Stone says Jennie, pictured, would be mortified at the thought of her sister being prosecuted for the car crash . 'There . is nothing to be achieved apart from destroying the family even more. I . thought the CPS was human. Enough, enough, the family have suffered . enough.' Tragedy struck the family last year when the sisters' brother Private Gregg Stone was shot dead in Afghanistan. Her late brother, Private Stone, of . the 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, was shot dead as he took part . in a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman in Helmand Province on June 3 . last year.

His widow at the time said: 'Gregg and I were childhood sweethearts and we met at school - he was my soulmate. 'He was a brilliant husband and a family man who loved his family. He was always the one to want to make us laugh - he always cheered everyone up. 'He was proud to be a soldier and for what he had achieved in his work. He would also want me to mention his dog Benji, who he loved to bits.' Private Stone was the 417th member of UK forces to die since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001.

"Italian police say they have arrested the ‘crucifixion killer’ at his home in Florence. Riccardo Vitia, a 55-year-old plumber was arrested at dawn on suspicion of the rape and murder of prostitute Andrea Cristina Zamfir whose lifeless body was found under a bridge in the Florentine village of Ugnano on Monday. The Romanian had been taped to a metal gate by the wrists into a crucifixion pose and was naked apart from her tennis shoes and socks. Murdered: Andrea Cristina Zamfir, 26, was found naked and bound with tape, beneath a bridge in Ugnano, a village near Florence, Italy. A man has now been arrested on suspicion of murder and rape .

Frankly, I did not sympathise with him, and thanked god for the blessing of Islam.' The post was re-tweeted more than 1,000 times but received a mixed response online. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Controversial: Balqees Faithi, an Emirati of Yemini descent, posted the tweet about Robin Williams (left) But it didn't finish there. She added: 'I found this video of him (Williams) ...he mocks the Quran in front of millions for the sake of his Zionist views. I know I am right. I dedicate this to his fans.' Robin Williams hanged himself on Sunday night while his wife slept in a nearby bedroom. He had several superficial cuts on the inside of his left wrist. A pocket knife with what appeared to be dried blood was discovered nearby. The Mrs Doubtfire and Good Will Hunting star's suicide comes after decades of battling depression and alcohol and drug addiction. Williams struggled with depression and an addiction to cocaine and alcohol for decades. Last month the married father of three was back in rehab 'fine-tuning' his sobriety in a year where he had been working on six movies and a TV series. Channel 4 News had to apologised after airing a clip of Robin Williams in the film Good Morning Vietnam saying 'Get a rope and hang me' in its coverage of the actor's death. The programme broadcast a report about the 63-year-old'd death last night after he was found dead yesterday at his California home. A preliminary coroner's report indicated the likely cause of death was suicide by asphyxiation. Robin Williams, in the 1987 film Good Morning Vietnam. Channel 4 News apologised for using a clip from the film in a report where his character says: 'Get a rope and hang me' The Channel 4 report included a clip from the 1987 film where Williams played an unorthodox DJ on U.S. Armed Services Radio in Vietnam. But the use of the quote was widely criticised on Twitter. Voiceover artist Trish Bertram said: 'Slightly unfortunate choice of Robin William's Good Morning Vietnam clip by Channel 4 News for their closing tribute.' While @Sophie 1983 tweeted: 'Did @Channel4News really use a clip from #GoodMorningVietnam where Robin Williams says ""why don't they just get a rope and hang me"" ?!?!?!?' Ross Anderson posted: 'Unfortunate choice of #RobinWilliams clip from @Channel4News to end tonight's programme #c4news #GoodMorningVietnam. Channel 4 later tweeted an apology after using the clip from Good Morning Vietnam in their coverage . They added that there was no offence intended and that their report was meant to be a heartfelt tribute . And Gary Ward said: 'Totally inappropriate clip to play from #channel4news with regards to Robin Williams passing.' Channel 4 News later issued an apology and altered the tribute when it was broadcast an hour later on Channel 4+1. A spokesman said: 'We'd like to apologise for including what was an inappropriate line from Good Morning Vietnam in our play-out from tonight's programme. 'There was no offence intended in what was meant to be a heartfelt tribute to Robin Williams.' It comes after Channel Seven in Australia came under fire for broadcasting a Family Guy episode featuring jokes about Robin Williams hours after it was revealed the actor had been found dead. Digital channel 7Mate broadcast the ‘Big Man on Hippocampus’ episode some 14 hours after news broke that the Good Will Hunting actor had died, Mumbrella reported. Family Guy episode 'Viewer Mail #2' featuring Robin Williams was broadcast on BBC Three, just as the news broke about the actor's death . A Seven spokesperson told Mumbrella: 'It was a coincidence'. Another Family Guy episode titled 'Viewer Mail #2' was also broadcast by the BBC which featured Williams - and suicide - just as news broke about his death. But a BBC spokesman said: 'This was a repeat that we have shown a couple of times before, so who could have planned that?' ‘It was scheduled more than two weeks ago so it is just an uncanny coincidence. Some of our people who work here noticed that the death of Robin Williams was announced just as this episode ended. ‘It was due to be repeated on Friday but we will not be showing it now.’ Viewer Mail #2 is from season ten of the popular comedy, which looks at the life of an American family and is regularly shown on BBC Three. Meanwhile TalkSPORT presenter also Alan Brazil provoked anger after saying he had 'no sympathy' for Robin Williams. The radio host claimed the star's apparent suicide was selfish considering the effect it would have on his loved ones. He said: 'I believe he’s got a daughter as well, what’s she feeling like this morning? Now she’s got to sort the arrangements out. I think it’s shocking, I really do. 'I don’t have a lot of sympathy, I’m sorry.' But a spokesman for the station said: 'TalkSPORT would like to apologise for any offence caused. Alan’s comments do not reflect the views of the station.'

"A housewife has told of her shock when she discovered a 'spooky alien face' had appeared in a painting that hung on her wall for ten years. Janice Craig loved the oil painting she had bought to brighten up her home when husband Brian made the discovery. The couple had been enjoying a romantic evening when Mr Craig, 57, leaned in to give Mrs Craig, 54, a cuddle. Spooky: Janice Craig loved her still life painting but one day her husband Brian pointed out the little alien who had appeared inside the frame - but can you see it? But he was left spooked after he spotted the face peering at him over her shoulder. In the left-hand corner of the Robert Cox painting, beneath the vase of white roses, a ghostly image had appeared. Mr Craig, a retired painter and decorator, from Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, said: 'I suddenly felt like someone was watching me, so I looked up and saw this creepy face staring back at me. 'The odd thing is that for quite some time I’d had a strong feeling that we were being watched. 'Even when we were alone in the room, it felt like someone was watching us - I instinctively felt eyes were following me when I moved.' Alien: Mr Craig said that he suddenly felt like someone was watching him and he turned round to find the face in the painting which has hung on the couple's wall for 10 years before they noticed . He said he got a 'massive shock' when he looked up and saw the face looking out of the painting. He said: 'It was really eerie - it completely freaked me out. 'Once I’d noticed it, we couldn’t watch TV or relax without seeing it out of the corner of our eyes.' Mrs Craig, who bought the Victorian-style original oil for £120 because it suited the room’s colour scheme, said: 'I didn’t notice the face for years and years, until Brian pointed it out. 'I can’t understand how I bought the painting and had it on the wall for 10 years without noticing it - so it makes me wonder if it has somehow appeared at some point during that time. Art: Mrs Craig bought the Victorian-style original oil for £120 because it suited the room’s colour scheme . 'Brian always said that he felt like someone was in the room with us, but I had never noticed anything until he spotted it. I was shocked when I saw the face, floating in the picture. 'There’s no question it is spooky - I think it looks like a small, alien child. You can see the outline and it’s eyes, nose and mouth quite clearly now, although I am sure it was never there before. 'Our family and friends have seen it and they all say it’s scary.' Alarmed by their close encounter of an unexpected kind, the couple hastily took the picture down. It now lies hidden behind a wardrobe in their spare bedroom.

"Google is profiting from adverts which appear alongside vile terror videos on YouTube, it emerged last night. The Mail has found adverts for reputable companies on videos of Al Qaeda fanatics calling for jihad. The companies, which include Vodafone, TalkTalk and iTunes, have little control over where their products feature on the hugely popular film-sharing website. A video of Anwar al-Awlaki called 'Was Islam Spread By The Sword' alongside an advert for the movie Flight . A worldwide call for Jihad and 'convert the whole world to Islam' appears next to an advert for Vodafone . This is because advertising on YouTube – which is owned by Google – is driven by the internet browsing habits of each individual, rather than being deliberately placed on each web page by companies. One major advertiser said Google ‘have got a lot to answer for’. A source said: ‘It is ridiculous that they would put our advertisements on videos such as these. We don’t have a choice in this at all. ‘We don’t want to be associated with these videos in any way whatsoever. We do not want to be associated with someone blowing someone else’s head up or someone spreading evil and hate.’ Vodafone added: ‘We were unaware of this situation and are understandably concerned. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.’ Google – which has the informal motto ‘Don’t be evil’ – posted a UK turnover of £3billion last year. Another al-Awlaki video and an advert for Ronseal. Companies have little control over where adverts appear . Anwar Al-Awlaki, the former ideological leader of Al Qaeda . Yesterday the Mail reported how thousands of Al Qaeda videos urging British Muslims to maim and kill can be found on YouTube within seconds. This is despite claims by the website that it has ‘community guidelines’ that prohibit ‘dangerous of illegal activities such as bomb making, hate speech and incitement to commit violent acts’ and accepts only ‘religious’ films. In one clip, Anwar al-Awlaki, the dead ideological leader of Al Qaeda, describes how ‘Islam is spread by the sword’. When the Mail watched this video, an advert for Flight, a Hollywood film about a plane crash starring Denzel Washington, popped up during al-Awlaki’s hate-filled rant. This advert is sponsored by iTunes, which is owned by technology giant Apple. The same video also featured an advert for Ronseal, the British wood stain manufacturer. When the video was played for a second time, an advert for Vodafone appeared on the screen. A separate video featuring the extremist raging about the ‘battle for hearts and minds’ features an advert for an Islamic dating website and another for Vodafone. Elsewhere on the site, a hate-filled sermon by extremist cleric Abu Qatada features an advert for HomeAway, which rents out upmarket holiday villas. YouTube currently has more than 100 videos of Anjem Choudary, the hate preacher whose banned extremist group radicalised Woolwich terrorist Michael Adebolajo. In his bile-filled rants he urges Muslims to wage jihad while in others he tells his fanatics to take advantage of the welfare state. In one, Choudary says: ‘There is a place for violence in Islam. There is a place for jihad in Islam’. Michael Adebolajo, pictured holding a bloodied knife in Woolwich, left, and at a march, right, was radicalised by Anjem Choudary's banned extremist group. There are more than 100 of Choudary's videos on YouTube . The video features an advert for the video game Call of Duty. Graham . Foulkes, whose 22-year-old son David was killed in the 7/7 bombings, . said: ‘If Google and YouTube are actually claiming this is free speech . and are making a profit out of it then that is outrageous. ‘I find it hard to understand how Google and YouTube can justify allowing these hate messages. Any right-minded person can see this is wrong. ‘I’m very much in favour of free speech, but preaching hatred and violence should not be allowed. ‘It’s wrong. It’s not the purpose of the internet. It’s not the purpose of free speech. Such behaviour should be prosecuted.’ Earlier this month Google was accused of ‘doing evil’ by avoiding British taxes, after paying just £7.3million in corporation tax, despite its turnover of £3billion last year.

"Do not read pornography in public and do not slurp your food is just some of hilarious advice offered in a new guide book on dating Western women for Japanese men. Love With A Western Woman claims Japanese men have average or smaller than average-sized penises, but stresses 90 per cent of Western women think size does not matter. It adds some women do not like 'bigger penises' because it can make 'sex painful', and advises men against calling their friends after intercourse to brag about having sex with a foriegn woman. Smooth operators: Love With A Western Women provides hilarious advice for Japanese men . The book highlights that in western culture it is 'very rare' for a child to share a bed with their parents and explains it can make the 'practicalities of when and where to have sex difficult'. It continues that many western women are willing to follow the Japanese tradition of sleeping together as a family. But it says this means men must be more creative about having sex instead of 'using sleeping arrangements as an excuse not to have it'. It adds: 'You have love hotels! Use them!' The author adds:  'Now come on boys, don't you all want to put some big smiles on the faces of your Western sweethearts?!' It is also cautions that 'fantastic sex is nothing like Japanese porn' because most women 'want or will be fulfilled', and suggests that men stop watching it. An extract published in the Japan Times added: 'We don’t like it when you read porn in public (and most of us aren’t really comfortable with you reading it in private either). 'This goes hand-in-hand with the whole concept of hostess bars, soaplands, and prostitution, which are completely distasteful to most of us.' Hardworking: The book warns Japanese men to balance their relationship with their job . The bizarre book is written by British author Caroline Pover, who divides her time between the UK and Japan. She has also penned a guide for western women living in Japan, which includes advice on everything from dating and 'organising contraception' to avoiding 'hair disasters' and finding clothes that fit. Love With A Western Woman explains that slurping food can drive a woman 'mad' and suggests men do not compare their build to the 'generally bigger' size of Western women. It also lists Japanese men who Western women 'love', including actor Kenichi Matsuyama and singer Takeshi Kaneshiro, and says men must strike the right balance between their relationship and work hard. Ms Pover warned against looking too feminine, with 'handbags and pointy shoes', which may cause Western women to think they are gay. It adds men should be confident, relaxed and respectful. They should treat women as equals, not order their food for them on a date and look at their eyes, not their breasts, the books says. A quote from an interviewee adds: 'You will get an independent woman who will need her 'me time,' girls' nights, and help with the house chores. 'My husband loves to jokingly tease me about how ‘a Japanese wife would never do that’ on a lot of things. So just know that you are signing up for something a little different.'","Book claims Japanese men have average-sized or small penises .

"A panda cub could be born in Britain for the first time within the next month. Zookeepers have found signs that Tian Tian, the UK’s only female giant panda, may be pregnant. Changes in her protein and hormone levels have been detected and her nesting behaviour has also changed. Scroll down for LIVE feed from the enclosure . New arrival? Keepers believe that Tian Tian may be pregnant after she was artificially inseminated in April . Tenterhooks: Hopeful keepers at the zoo have observed Tian Tian's lack of appetite, moodiness, and 'nesting behaviour' Who's the daddy? Only blood tests on the cub would determine whether Yuang Guan, left, or Bao Bao, right, is the father . Edinburgh Zoo said the signs were encouraging – but warned there is still a chance it could be a phantom pregnancy. Ian Valentine, director of the zoo’s panda project, said: ‘It is possible Tian Tian could give birth in just two weeks. ‘The window we are looking at starts on August 24 but it looks like it may be towards the end of the month or later.’ The zoo artificially inseminated ten-year-old Tian Tian after she was reluctant to mate with her male companion Yang Guang. Something to celebrate? The team at the zoo artificially inseminated Tian Tian, or Sweetie, after she was reluctant to mate with her male companion Yang Guang, or Sunshine . Precious: Tian Tian, seen rolling backwards in her enclosure at the zoo today, and male Yang Guang are the UK's only pair of giant pandas . 'Moody': The team at the zoo have not been able to carry out an ultrasound, but if their suspicions prove correct Tian Tian could give birth to a cub as soon as next month . Keeping us guessing: Tian Tian and Yang Guang arrived from China in December 2011 . New Mum: Tian Tian's hormones have changed, suggesting she is pregnant or in a stage of pseudo-pregnancy . Motherly? Tian Tian relaxes today after it was announced that she may be pregnant . The pair arrived in Scotland in 2011 on a ten-year loan from China. There was no way to be certain Tian Tian is pregnant because she has resisted an ultrasound scan. She has been showing a lack of appetite and restlessness, and has made a bed of straw in apparent nesting behaviour but pandas are prone to pseudo pregnancies. Mr Valentine said: ‘Confirming a female panda’s pregnancy is never straightforward and we would encourage people to try not to get too excited just yet. 'Indications are good': Keepers in Edinburgh described signs Tian Tian could be pregnant as 'hugely exciting' ‘The overall picture is looking quite good. We have to assume she will give birth not just to one but to twins. Quite often pandas  in captivity give birth to twins,  and she gave birth to twins the last time.’ If the pregnancy is confirmed, an expert from China will fly over before the birth. Sperm from a giant panda in Berlin, Bao Bao, was used in the attempt to inseminate Tian Tian. However, only a blood test on the cub will determine whether he or Yang Guang is the father. The cub, or cubs, would officially be the property of China and be sent there after two years. The panda pair have been a popular attraction, with visits from around 500,000 people in their first year . Ready to mate: Yang Guang relaxes in as he prepares to mate with Tian Tian in the window of opportunity . Tian Tian enjoys the pool in her enclosure at Edinburgh Zoo as she . approaches her annual window of opportunity when her hormones are high . Male Yang Guang (pictured) and Tian Tian are kept separate  as pandas can be territorial . Tian Tian and Yang Guang will stay in Edinburgh for a decade. Any child will be sent to China after two years . Giant pandas are native to the mountain forests of Chinese provinces Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu. Estimates suggest only between 1,000 and 2,000 giant pandas remain in the wild. Tian Tian and Yang Guang are the first to live in the UK for 17 years. They are staying at Edinburgh Zoo for a decade. The zoo grows about 15% of the bamboo needed to feed the giant pandas. The rest is imported from Amsterdam. Yang Guang goes through 55kg of bamboo a day and Tian Tian around 30kg. Female pandas ovulate once a year, giving a window of just 36 hours in which they can get pregnant. Normal breeding season for pandas is from mid-April to May. Tian Tian was artificially inseminated in April using semen from Yang Guang and frozen semen from Bao Bao, a 'genetically important' panda which died in Berlin Zoo last year. Gestation period is typically five months and the panda will give birth to one or two cubs. Panda cubs are born blind, hairless and unable to move, making them dependent on their mother for survival. After six to eight weeks, cubs open their eyes for the first time. They feed on their mother's milk for the first year and start eating bamboo at around six months. Big eater: Panda Yang Guang needs 44lb of bamboo shoots every day . August 24 2003: Tian Tian born and reared at Ya'an reserve in Chengdu, China. Yang Guang born 10 days earlier. 2011 .

"Britain has become the biggest magnet for migrants in Europe, EU officials revealed yesterday. The highest total recorded – 590,950 – came to live here in 2010, their figures showed. This intake was more than twice the 251,159 migrants who opted to go to France. It means that this country has overtaken Spain and Germany, where levels fell sharply, as the top target for immigrants seeking jobs and a new home. The rise in numbers coming here marks a historic immigration landmark and comes as a new wave of incomers from Romania and Bulgaria is expected in 2014. Immigration: The highest total of migrants recorded - 590,950 - came to live in Britain in 2010, figures have revealed . Whitehall has declined to publish its estimates of how many will come then. For decades, Germany has had higher immigration levels than Britain while Spain’s rates shot ahead ten years ago as its boom drew millions from Spanish-speaking Latin America. French immigration dropped below British levels in the 1990s. But the latest analysis by Eurostat, the EU statistics arm, indicated that economic collapse in Spain and tighter controls in Germany have made Britain the main destination for migrants from Europe and elsewhere. The comparisons cover 2010 but the UK is likely to have retained top place in the immigration table. Latest figures show there were 536,000 long-term immigrants to Britain in the year to April 2012. Whitehall has declined to publish its estimates of how many migrants will come from Romania and Bulgaria in 2014 . The level is far ahead of likely totals for Spain and Germany, despite the efforts of the Coalition to cut the numbers of unskilled foreign workers. Its limited success in this may be further highlighted next year when EU legislation allows Romanians and Bulgarians the unfettered right to live and work in Britain. German cities facing less pressure from immigration than their British counterparts have already complained of the impact of migrants from the two Eastern European countries. Yesterday, the Mail reported that they have warned Chancellor Angela Merkel about ‘significant costs of poverty migration’ and a risk to ‘social peace’. Think-tank Migrationwatch warned that restricting the impact of immigration here is going to be a major headache for ministers. Its chairman, Sir Andrew Green,  said: ‘These figures are yet another indicator showing that Labour lost control of immigration. Our mass immigration far exceeds that of all the other major countries in Europe. ‘The Government is making huge efforts to get the numbers under control but it is not going to be easy given that Britain has become the destination of choice in Europe.’ Immigration into Britain was running at just over 300,000 a year until rising under Labour in 1997. Numbers passed 400,000 in 2003 and 500,000 in 2004 when the borders were opened to workers from Poland and eight other EU countries. Germany, Spain and almost all other EU countries put curbs on Eastern European workers. UK officials predicted that only 13,000 Poles would arrive but, in fact, more than a million did so and Polish is now this country’s second most common language. German cities have already been warning Chancellor Angela Merkel (pictured) of the impact of migrants from Bulgaria and Romania . Immigration peaked in 2010 and dropped to 566,000 in 2011. Full  figures for 2012 have not yet been published. After coming to power in 2010, the Coalition promised to cut net immigration to below 100,000 a year. But ministers have struggled to reduce this statistic, which measures how migration increases the population after immigration and emigration have been counted. ‘The Government is making huge efforts . to get the numbers under control but it is not going to be easy given . that Britain has become the destination of choice in Europe’ - Sir Andrew Green, chairman of think-tank Migrationwatch . The figure fell from 252,000 in 2010 to 183,000 at the latest count. However, it is still well above net migration in Germany, whose population swelled by 151,600 in 2010. That year, Spain’s net immigration was just 62,200 as 400,000 quit its collapsing economy. Eurostat said immigration restrictions had been a success across much of the EU. Limits focused on attracting specific migrants to combat skills shortages, based on language proficiency, work experience, education and age. It added: ‘Significant resources have been mobilised to fight people smuggling and trafficking.’ The figures reveal how the dramatic fall in migration to Spain and Germany began in 2009 as the recession began to bite. In Germany, it fell from 682,000 in 2008 to 404,000 in 2010. In Spain, it fell from a peak of 958,000 in 2007 to 465,000 in 2010. The impact of immigration to Britain was underlined by the 2011 census, which showed the population was 63.2million, half a million more than expected. There were four million immigrants in a decade, whose arrival helped push the population of England and Wales up by 3.7 million.","The highest total of migrants recorded came to live in Britain in 2010 .

"June Shannon and her daughter Alana Thompson, aka Honey Boo Boo, star in the reality series Here Comes Honey Boo Boo . The controversial family, who live in McIntrye, Georgia and have labelled themselves rednecks numerous times, were also visited by child services in March according to a report . Honey Boo Boo's controversial mother June, the coupon queen, was arrested on January 3, 2008 for theft and contempt of court. A mugshot of 33-year-old June Shannon, the mother of six-year-old Alana Thompson, aka Honey Boo Boo, has surfaced as well as details of her arrest which took place in Henry County, Georgia. According to Starcasm, there are also additional court reports which show that the mother-of-three was the defendant in two child support cases around the same time, which may explain the theft charges, though it is not entirely clear. It comes just days after learning that child services made an unannounced visit to her and husband Mike Thompson's family home in rural McIntrye, Georgia in March of this year. Scroll down for video . Class act: June Shannon, Honey Boo Boo's mother, was arrested in 2008 for theft and contempt of court. Her mug shot (above) just days after she and her husband Mike Thompson were accused of child abuse . The coupon queen, as she is commonly referred to, was arrested in a location that is more than halfway to Atlanta when measured from her current home, suggesting that she may have been trying to escape police. The family were visited by the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services in March, according to The National Enquirer. A source told the magazine that authorities who made the visit 'found reason to bring the case to court' but a 'court-appointed attorney' for June convinced the judge to 'throw it [the case] out'. The source said investigators were called to the home as a result of June and Mr Thompson's unorthodox, and highly-publicised, parenting methods which include feeding Alana caffeinated drinks as well as roadkill for dinner. Finding fame: She now stars in the spin-off show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo along with her family . The family now star in their own spin-off reality series, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, which has also showed Alana go mud belly flop diving, adopt a pet pig named Glitzy, attend local food auctions with June and help her buy more than a dozen packets of chocolate milk powder, during one supermarket visit, using discount coupons. The source added: 'Honey Boo Boo's upbringing raised eyebrows with neighbours.' The initial visit by authorities is said to have occurred 'shortly after filming began' on the new TLC series which premiered on August 8. It attracted 2.2million viewers. Although June sparked outrage back in January when she was seen on Toddlers & Tiaras feeding Alana 'Go Go Juice', a mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull, the authorities visited the family after catching wind of an online video that showed Alana dancing for dollars in a bar. Go-Go Juice: Honey Boo Boo shot to fame early this year after her mother was seen giving her a mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull on an episode of Toddlers & Tiaras . Crazy: Once she had consumed the Juice, she was seen spinning around on the floor, her energy heightened .

The child has been shown to feast on roadkill and ample sugary sweets on several occasions . The video, which can still be found on YouTube, was not filmed by the network however showed Alana in a darkened room, dancing atop of table as coloured lights flash around her. June defended her daughter's actions by explaining that Alana had been dancing in a college bar, not a sleazy one. The 'Go Go Juice' incident, which saw Alana being fed the liquid after having downed 15 bags of Pixy Stix, tubes of powdered sugar commonly referred to as 'pageant crack', attracted negative criticism of its own. June was filmed instructing Alana to take 'two big gulps' from an . unlabelled bottle. Within seconds, the change was apparent and the . pageant hopeful was seen rapidly swinging her arms over her head and . spinning around on the floor, exclaiming: 'My Go Go juice is kicking in . right now!' Beauty pageant insiders speculate that some mothers' 'special juice' blends may even contain alcohol. Lewd: June was seen in the debut episode of her new reality series, grinding up against a young man . Stealing the limelight: June (left) has arguably become more of a focus in the reality show than her beauty pageant star daughter (right). The pair were seen on CNN earlier this month promoting the new TLC show . Describing how . the drink made her feel, Alana said: 'Go Go juice makes me laughy, and . play-ey, and makes me feel like I want to pull my mommy's hair.' June has stolen much of the limelight away from her daughter in the new reality series. During its debut episode, she was seen grinding up against a young man as her daughter played in a giant mud pit.

"Colorado is set to introduce stricter rules on from driving under the influence of marijuana, following the drug's legalisation in the state. A plan to legalise the drug for adults over the age of 21 was backed by voters under the passage of Amendment 64 in November last year. But politicians are concerned that increasing use of marijuana could lead to more people driving under the influence. Rules: Lawmakers in Colorado are attempting to pass proposals aimed at tightening the rules on driving under the influence of marijuana . Supporters of the introduction of tighter sanctions have pointed to evidence from 2011 revealing that 13 per cent of fatal crashes in the state involved the drug. Lawmakers have already tried to pass a bill on three occasions in previous years, so they have watered down proposals to ensure their progression this time. The current proposals set a limit of five nanograms of THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, per millilitre of blood. Repuplican Mark Waller, R-Colorado Springs, who has put forward the bill, said: 'So we’re saying you’re presumed to be under influence of marijuana at five nanograms.' But Mr Waller, a former prosecutor, told CBS that even if over that limit drivers could still get off. He admitted that . the burden of proof will be higher for police and prosecutors, suggesting they will need further evidence of impairment, such as dangerous driving or slurred speech. Limit: The current proposals set a limit of five nanograms of THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, per millilitre of blood - but prosecutors will need to provide further proof such as dangerous driving . The proposal is aimed at addressing the concerns of medical marijuana users, who are often chronically over the five nanogram limit. Mr Waller said: 'I think that’s what’s going to help it pass this year.' Marijuana advocates, however, have argued that five nanograms is an arbitrary limit. Many argue the rules will result in people who smell like marijuana having unnecessary blood tests taken. Mr Waller said: 'It is time to act. We need to do . something to protect the citizens of Colorado, and that’s exactly what . this driving under influence of marijuana does.'","Lawmakers plan to limit of five nanograms of THC per millilitre of blood .

"Doctors and nurses who suffer from weight problems should be offered gastric surgery in order to retain credibility with patients on weight loss treatments, a report will say. Overweight NHS staff ought to be given dietary advice and counselling as well as stomach stapling operations as they are setting a bad example for patients, the Royal College of Physicians said. Over half of medical staff within NHS organisations are likely to be overweight, in accordance with statistics for the British population. Gastric help: NHS staff who are overweight or obese should be offered stomach stapling surgery as they set a bad example for patients suffering from weight problems (file photo) The report by the Royal College of Physicians, set to be published next week, will focus on the lack of treatment for weight problems and obesity within the NHS. It is also set to conclude that work needs to be done to reduce weight problems for medical staff as they lose credibility in giving overweight and obese patients advice on a healthy lifestyle. Hypocrisy: If the NHS staff advising overweight people are overweight themselves, they lose their credibility (file photo) ‘We want to make sure that people who work in the hospital health service are exposed to having the ability to get help where they need it,’ John Wass, author of the report told The Sunday Times, adding that ‘a lot of’ NHS medical staff are overweight. The report will urge NHS . organisations to focus on the health of their staff as well as their . patients an ensure there is healthy food on offer for doctors and nurses . and not 'sell Coca-Cola all over the place', John Wass added. Stomach stapling, also known as vertical banded gastroplasty, is a type of gastric surgery which uses . both a gastric band and staples to reduce the size of the stomach, . effectively restricting food intake. A private stomach stapling surgery costs between £5,000 and £8,000. The NHS offers weight-loss surgery . only as a ‘last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese’ meaning a person with a body mass index above 40. It is also offered to people with a .

"Ezell Ford, 25, was shot dead by officers in South Los Angeles on Monday evening . An eyewitness to the death of Ezell Ford has claimed an officer with the LAPD shouted 'shoot him' just before the mentally ill unarmed 25-year-old was fatally shot on Monday. The Huffington Post claims witness, Leroy Hill, saw an officer with the LAPD shoot Ford three times while he was on the ground and that he saw the entire incident unfold in front of him. Hill denied that Ford had any association with Los Angeles gangs and claimed that officers ambushed him as he walked down the street. 'He wasn't a gang banger at all,' said Hill said to HuffPost. 'I was sitting across the street when it happened. So as he was walking down the street, the police approached him, whatever was said I couldn't hear it, but the cops jumped out of the car and rushed him over here into this corner. 'They had him in the corner and were beating him, busted him up, for what reason I don't know he didn't do nothing. 'The next thing I know I hear a 'pow!' while he's on the ground. They got the knee on him. And then I hear another 'pow!' No hesitation. And then I hear another 'pow!' Three times.' Ezell Ford, 25, was allegedly shot dead by officers in the Florence neighbourhood in South Los Angeles on Monday evening. A demonstrator throws back a tear gas container after tactical officers worked to break up a group of protesters in Ferguson, Missouri on Tuesday night amid ongoing demonstrations over the cop shooting of an unarmed teen . His family say Mr Ford was complying with police orders and was lying down when he was fatally shot at the intersection of West 65th Street and South Broadway at 8.12pm. According to Lietenant Ellis Imaizumi of the Los Angeles Police Department, officers were carrying out an 'investigative stop' during which a 'struggle ensued' and police opened fire. Mr Ford was taken to hospital but later died of his injuries. According to police, no officers were injured. Speaking to KTLA, Ezell Ford said her son was shot three times while he was lying on the ground and following the officers' orders. She also said they refused to tell her which hospital her son had been taken too but this has been denied by LAPD. Another relative said Mr Ford had mental health problems. He said: 'They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications. 'Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division, knows that — that this child has mental problems. A Facebook page calling for justice for Ezell Ford has now been set up and a rally has been organised for Sunday at 3pm at LAPD headquarters. The shooting came two days after Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri. A third . night of violent protests flared up in Ferguson, Missouri, as . police in riot gear and armored trucks trained high-powered rifles on . protesters. Police . revealed today that a woman had been shot in the head in an alleged . drive-by shooting in Ferguson on Tuesday night while in a separate . incident, a police officer reportedly shot an armed man. It was unclear whether the shootings were connected to the protests, according to NBC reports. Demonstrators protest the killing of teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri . According to WBNS, four men wearing ski masks and armed with shotguns believed to be staging a robbery were apprehended by officers. One . suspect confronted an officer with a handgun. The officer, who feared . for his life said a police spokesman, shot the armed subject. The alleged robber was taken to hospital in critical condition. In . a separate incident, a woman was shot once in the head during a . drive-by shooting, police reported. She was taken to hospital and is . expected to live. The . Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has established a no-fly zone over . Ferguson after police said one of their helicopters was fired upon on . multiple occasions. The ban will remain in place until Monday. Following a rally by civil rights leader Al Sharpton on Tuesday, crowds confronted police and refused orders to disperse. Rev. Al Sharpton speaks during a gathering to calm tension following the shooting of black teenager Michael Brown . Police fired more tear gas on the protests but overall, the situation did not escalate as it had on previous nights. On . Sunday and Monday nights, tensions have run high in Ferguson where . crowds looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles and taunted . police. Riot officers dressed in tactical gear shot rubber bullets and bean-bag rounds at protesters who volleyed rocks in return. At . a rally held by Reverend Sharpton on Tuesday night, the mother of . Michael Brown, Lesley McSpadden, demanded that the police officer who . shot her son come forward. 'You . take your punishment,' Lesley McSpadden said. 'If you were a man you'd . stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.' Reverend . Sharpton added: 'The local authorities have put themselves in a . position - hiding names and not being transparent - where people will . not trust anything but an objective investigation.' The shooting in LA came two days after Michael Brown (pictured) was killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri . Her plea comes as Ferguson police refused to name of the officer in question, citing death threats made on social media. The police claim that the teenager assaulted the police officer in the street on Saturday and made a grab for his weapon. That claim is entirely refuted by Brown's friend, Dorian Johnson, who was within feet of the entire incident. Mr . Johnson, 22, said his friend fled from the officer after being shot . once, held his hands up and shouted that he was unarmed. The officer . then repeatedly fired shots at Brown, Mr Johnson said. Police admit that Brown was shot 'a couple of times' but could not give an exact number. Vigils have been planned across the U.S. on Thursday in response to recent alleged acts of police brutality including the killing of 18-year-old Brown. Organized by a movement called the National Moment Of Silence, vigils are being planned in 50 cities across 30 states. President Obama released a statement on Tuesday where he addressed the teen's shooting. He . said: 'The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I . send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this . very difficult time. 'As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the . Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local . officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as . needed. 'I . know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but . as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across . the country, to remember this young man through reflection and . understanding. 'We . should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that . heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what . Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.'","Ezell Ford, 25, was shot dead by officers in South Los Angeles .

"Theatre producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh has been sued by a FedEx delivery man for $2.9million after he slipped on a wet floor. Mackintosh’s personal cleaner had mopped the floor outside of his Manhattan office. The producer of Cats, Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables did not believe that the cleaning service provided by the building was good enough. Sir Cameron Mackintosh has paid out $2.9million after a FedEx delivery man slipped on a floor his cleaner had mopped . He had his cleaner Esme David tidy up the Broadway office twice a week and his apartment three times, reported the New York Daily News. The FedEx delivery man slipped on the floor at 9.30am on November 13 2008. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital where he was told he tore his rotator cuff muscles in his shoulder, ruptured tendons in his thighs and torn cartilage in his knee. The delivery man, who also had neck and back injuries, was disabled and told he could not work again. The FedEx delivery man was left disabled and forced to retire after 19 years on the job (Stock image) His lawyer, Scott Rynecki said: ‘For someone who produced elaborate Broadway shows, he didn’t do such a good job managing his personnel. ‘There are obvious dangers with mopping the floor at the same time people are arriving for work.’ Mackintosh, 54, was not there at the time of the accident, and was not questioned under oath. Staff at the office said that the arrangement was unusual, as Ms David only cleaned Mackintosh’s part. Mackintosh, who was knighted in 1996, has produced musicals in New york and London, including My fair Lady (pictured) Cameron Mackintosh at a party celebrating cats becoming the longest running musical in the world, with Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber . Office manager Jennifer O’Connor said: ‘It is my understanding that because we care about the look of our office and our high-profile clientele that (Esme David) was hired to come in and do supplemental cleaning . . . because what was done by the building was not sufficient.’ The settlement was negotiated last week after a jury was selected at Brooklyn Supreme Court. The claimant asked not to be identified as he lives in an area of high crime and was worried it would risk his safety.","A FedEx delivery man received $2.9million from Sir Cameron Mackintosh .

"Homeless Meshach Harrison stabbed the victim in the eye inside a Birmingham restaurant . A beggar has been jailed for just two years for blinding a Good Samaritan who offered to buy him food. Homeless Meshach Harrison stabbed the victim in the eye inside a Birmingham takeaway. The thug had repeatedly demanded cash from the 25-year-old and rebuffed offers of food. Harrison, 29, had been due to stand trial for possession of an offensive weapon and inflicting grievous bodily harm before he admitted the GBH offence at Birmingham Crown Court. Detectives released CCTV footage of Harrison after the attack, which happened inside Spices takeaway around 7pm on December 5 last year. The beggar had asked the victim, who was with a friend, for a cigarette. He was given one but then asked for cash and continued to harass the pair who were walking towards the takeaway. Despite . offering to buy him food, Harrison followed the victim into the . takeaway and then stabbed him the left eye with an unknown object. Speaking at the time of the attack, police said the man was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Det Con Sharon Duncan, from Force CID, said last December: 'The beggar approached the two men on five or six occasions and, even though they offered to buy him food, he kept asking for cash. 'Finally he struck one of the men in his left eye with an unknown object. 'The young man was rushed to hospital, where he had to undergo surgery. His eye was saved, but unfortunately he has lost the sight in it. 'This is a devastating loss to a young man, who just appeared to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.' Detectives released CCTV footage of Harrison after the attack, which happened inside Spices restaurant . However, his two-year sentence was condemned as 'appalling' by the city MP whose constituency includes the crime scene in Soho Road, Handsworth. Khalid Mahmood challenged the judge who imposed the term to justify it to traders worried about crime. 'I’m very concerned about the length of the sentence,' he said. 'It should have been far more severe. 'This is a devastating loss to a young man, who just appeared to be in the wrong place at the wrong time' Det Con Sharon Duncan . 'This shows how out of touch the judiciary is with the public. 'I would like to invite the judge to walk with me along Soho Road so he can explain this sentence to the traders and residents and discuss the crime issues they have. 'It is shocking the victim was attacked after offering to buy food. 'We are working alongside the police to fight crime and improve the area. 'That is why sentences like this, for very serious offences in the area, are particularly disappointing.' Justice Minister Lord Faulks said: 'Crime is falling and tough sentences are available to punish criminals, including life sentences for serious violent offences. 'Sentencing in individual cases is a matter for the judges, taking into account all the facts of each case and the relevant sentencing guidelines.'","Meshach Harrison stabbed victim in the eye in a Birmingham restaurant .

"The driver of an 18-wheel tractor-trailer that collided with a bus and killed four members of a Texas community college softball team told investigators he had been distracted by something in his cabin before the accident, authorities said Sunday. The truck was northbound on Interstate 35 near Davis, Oklahoma Friday night when it veered across the median and smashed into the bus carrying 15 members of the North Central Texas College women's softball team and driven by their coach. The truck, driven by Russell Staley, 53, of Saginaw, Texas, continued off the interstate. Staley was treated for injuries and released. There were no charges pending against him.

'He (Staley) said he was distracted by something in the cabin,' said Oklahoma Highway Patrol Captain Ronnie Hampton, who declined to say what the distraction was. He said that investigators do not necessarily agree with Staley's explanation. The Highway Patrol will eventually turn over the results of its investigation to the local district attorney, who will decide whether to pursue criminal charges. Hampton also said investigators had obtained search warrants to collect evidence from both the truck and the bus.

There were a total of 16 people on the bus at the time - 15 players and their coach.Some players were injured and taken to hospital, though it is not clear how many or how badly they were hurt. Oklahoma Highway Patrol officers said the crash was so bad it took investigators and hour to find the truck after the collision. Captain Ronnie Hampton said: 'What we do know is that the semi [truck] was headed north on I-35 when he departed the roadway and entered the southbound lanes. He told The Oklahoman. 'When it impacted the bus, it just kept going and went off the side of road. ... We knew we had a two-vehicle accident by what we saw at the scene. ... But it took about an hour before we found the semi.' Emergency: There were 16 people on board the bus last night - 15 players and a coach . The front end of the team van was virtually untouched while the sides of the vehicle were heavily damaged. The driver's side of the van sustained the worst damage. The softball coach, who was driving the van, declined treatment at the scene and escaped without serious injury. The truck driver of the was taken to hospital is expected to survive. Hampton said: 'Right now, it's being investigated like a homicide.' Details of the collision could not be immediately confirmed. Hampton said: 'Something happened to cause [the driver] to depart the roadway and impact the other vehicle.'An investigation is set to take weeks. A Post on the North Central Texas College Facebook page said: 'We ask for your prayers at this time for our softball team. Their bus has been involved in an accident in Oklahoma.'","Driver Russell Staley, 53, of Saginaw, Texas told investigators he was distracted by something in his cabin moments before the Friday night crash .

"Plans to use public money to fund a halal abattoir in Wales that uses non-stun slaughter has sparked fury. File photo . Vets have condemned plans to use taxpayers' money to fund a halal abattoir that uses non-stun slaughter. The British Veterinary Association is calling on the Welsh government to end talks with Pak Mecca Meats over subsidising job creation at its Cig Menai Cymru abattoir in Caernarfon, Wales. On its website, the company says it supplies the 'best quality stun free meat in accordance with the highest halal procedures'. It adds that 'given the choice 90% of Muslims prefer non-stun method of slaughter when it comes to consuming halal meat'. The BVA wrote to Rebecca Evans, Deputy Minister for Farming and Food, and were told the abattoir has been approved by the Food Standards Agency to carry out non-stun killing. She confirmed the Welsh Government was 'in dialogue with a private company regarding job creation at an abattoir in Caernarfon'. But vets have cited animal welfare concerns and blasted the Welsh Government's consideration of using public money to support the company. The European Union requires animals to be stunned before slaughter but allows countries, including Wales, to make exemptions on religious grounds. The BVA wants to end these exemptions and ensure all animals are pre-stunned before slaughter. A petition calling for the end of non-stun slaughter has more than 95,000 signatures. John Blackwell, President of the BVA, said: 'BVA advocates that all animals which enter an abattoir be stunned before being killed – this view is based on scientific evidence that shows that non-stun slaughter allows animals to perceive pain. The British Veterinary Association is calling on the Welsh government to end talks with Pak Mecca Meats. File photo . 'Concern about welfare of animals at slaughter is a priority not only for our members, but also the general public.' 'This is a clear signal that the Welsh Government is out of touch with the public on this issue. It must align its policies with animal welfare concerns and public opinion today.' Rob Davies, President of the Welsh branch of the BVA, added: 'The Welsh Government has failed to answer questions about whether or not they are willing to give financial support to a company which undertakes and promotes non-stun killing as a marketing tool. Halal means permitted or lawful for Muslims. Halal food is what is allowed to be eaten according to Islamic scripture. These foods need to be properly prepared by specific processes, including 'halal slaughter'. To be halal certified the animal must be facing Mecca, have its throat cut while still alive and then ritually sacrificed by a Muslim who recites a prayer dedicating the slaughter to Allah. Foods that are haram (forbidden) in Islam include (but are not exclusive to) pork products, alcohol, blood and carnivorous animals. 'It seems that animal welfare is not a concern for the Deputy Minister in this particular discussion.' Mr Davies urged the Welsh Government to confirm that it will not spend public money on abattoirs which don't stun animals before killing them. He added: I would appeal to Welsh farmers to consider the damage done to the image and reputation of Welsh meat if they knowingly take or send animals to an abattoir which doesn't stun before killing, whether a local abattoir or a distant one. 'Welsh meat must be welfare friendly from birth to slaughter.' The TaxPayers' Alliance say that public money should not be used for expanding any business, regardless of what the business is. Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers shouldn't be footing the bill for any business to expand. 'It's ridiculous that politicians pick winners using our hard-earned cash, regardless of whether the business is contentious or not. 'A friendly business environment means lower taxes, not corporate welfare.'","Vets condemned plans to use taxpayers' money to fund Pak Mecca Meats .

"In court: Emma West has pleaded guilty to a racially aggravated public order offence after ranting racist comments on a tram in November 2011 . The woman whose racist rant at fellow tram passengers horrified millions on YouTube has finally, after more than 18 months, admitted her guilt. Mother-of-two Emma West, 34, was secretly filmed by a passenger on a mobile phone and the clip, entitled My Tram Experience, was posted online in November 2011. West, a former dental nurse from New Addington, Croydon, south London, was charged days later with a racially aggravated section 4 public order offence. It can now also be revealed that West pleaded guilty last month to stabbing and slashing her partner . Ricky Metson with an ornamental knife and assaulting a police . officer. On Monday, after a . string of adjournments in which her lawyers claimed her mental health . problems meant she was not fit to stand trial, West finally pleaded . guilty to the racist rant. She admitted the lesser . charge of a racially aggravated section 5 public order offence - using . threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly . behaviour that is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress when she . appeared at Croydon Crown Court. She will be sentenced jointly for the tram rant and the attacks on her partner and a police officer on June 24. More than 2.2m people viewed the clip . of her vile abuse within 24 hours of it being posted online and 88,000 . members of the public commented on the footage. West, with a toddler on her knee, shouted: 'What has this country come to? A load of black people and a load of f***ing Polish. 'You ain’t English. No, you ain’t English either. You ain’t English. None of you’s f***ing English.“It’s nothing now. Britain is nothing now. My Britain is f*** all now.' Others posted links to the video on . their social networking accounts and the film inspired a number of other . people to record other racist behaviour on public transport. Details can now be reported of how West attacked her partner of 12 years. More than 2.2m people viewed the clip of her vile abuse within 24 hours of it being posted online . She had enjoyed a family day out and was . dancing in the living room when she snapped during a conversation about . her brother and started punching and slapping Mr Metson, Croydon . Magistrates’ Court was told. Emma West at court with her partner Ricky Metson who she admitted stabbing with an ornamental knife . Remi Ogunfowora, prosecuting, said: . 'Mr Metson put his hands up in front of him to protect himself and told . her to calm down. 'She said she was going to call her mum and ran . upstairs and Mr Metson followed. 'As . he entered the room she picked up an ornamental knife from its sheath, . struck him in the head and started slashing at his body. 'He slapped her . around the face in self-defence to try and calm her down and went . downstairs. 'She followed . him down the stairs and stabbed him in the back at least twice. 'She . tried to run out the house and he stopped her leaving and called the . police.' Croydon . Magistrates’ Court heard when police arrived they found Mr Metson, who . was only wearing a pair of shorts covered in blood. Officers recovered a . knife from the property that was about six to eight inches long. Ms Ogunfowora said: 'Mr Metson suffered . two puncture wounds on his back and various slash and scratch wounds . over his stomach, head, back of his neck, arms and legs. 'When officers tried to arrest Miss West she started to kick them.' Mr Metson is standing by West after her attack on him and was with her at court on Monday. The tram rant case and the assault cases were adjourned until June 24 pending pre-sentence reports.

"A senior Justice Department official told a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on Thursday that several agencies including the FBI are investigating partisan political activity inside the IRS, and that former official Lois Lerner's disappearing emails are on the menu. A criminal investigation, Deputy Attorney General James Cole testified, 'is being conducted by career attorneys and agents of the Department’s Criminal and Civil Rights Divisions, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Cole declined to provide lawmakers with details about what the DOJ has uncovered. 'I can, however, tell you,' he added, 'that the investigation includes investigating the circumstances of the lost emails from Ms.Lerner’s computer.' Lerner, who led the IRS division tasked with vetting and monitoring tax-exempt nonprofits until her retirement late last year, is Republicans' central bête noire in the controversy over how her sub-agency targeted conservative groups with aggressive scrutiny and years-long delays when they applied for the coveted charitable status. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Deputy Attorney General James Cole told the House Oversight Committee on Thursday that the Justice Department's investigation into the IRS tea party targeting scandal includes a probe into Lois Lerner's missing emails . Lerner (R) headed the IRS division that policed nonprofit groups, and is accused of purposely targeting right-wing organizations for unusually intrusive scrutiny . Republicans on the oversight committee hit the roof when IRS Commissioner John Koskinen confirmed last month that years' worth of Lerner's government emails, which they had been demanding since 2013, were casualties in a hard drive crash. Koskinen drew gasps during a congressional hearing when he acknowledged that after forensic experts failed to retrieve the emails, the agency recycled the drive – rendering it permanently unavailable to investigators in the legislative branch of government. He also admitted, under questioning by Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, that the IRS failed to look at a backup tape that could have provided copies of Lerner's emails for a six-month period. Cole's statement on Thursday is the first indication that the Obama administration may have moved with purpose to probe what happened, despite the GOP's hints at a partisan slow-walk – or, worse, a cover-up in which Lerner herself destroyed evidence of her alleged wrongdoing. Lerner's attorney, William Taylor III, did not respond to an email seeking comment. On July 9 he released a statement claiming that his client 'did not destroy any records subject to the Federal Records Act, she did not cause the computer assigned to her to fail, and she made every effort to recover the files on the computer.' Although Republicans learned of the email losses in June, her hard drive crashed in 2011. Some Republicans believe the data loss as happened at too opportune a time to have been an accident: Just days earlier, the GOP had begun publicly questioning the IRS's partisan activity. That was two years before Lerner herself outed the program by answering a planted question at a conference for tax professionals in May 2013. Her admission presaged a report, long in the making, that the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration released days later. That same year, a surviving email shows, Lerner cautioned her colleagues and underlings to communicate via instant message instead of by email, because the latter would be open to congressional inquiries. Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan reacted to Cole's written testimony late on Wednesday, telling The Wall Street Journal that it was overdue. 'Finally, someone in the administration admits that the destruction of two years of emails from Lois Lerner is fishy,' Jordan said. Clash: Republican Rep. Darrell Issa (R) has continually crossed swords with Democrat Elijah Cummings (L) over the question of whether Lerner can claim Fifth Amendment privileges and refuse to testify about her agency's partisan activities . Like other Republicans, Jordan wants the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor instead of relying on its own lawyers to conduct the investigation. That seems unlikely, as Cole's appearance at Thursday's hearing appears calculated in part to quell conservatives' fears about the DOJ's impartiality. 'This whole thing is about Democrats in power abusing Republicans,' a senior staffer to an Oversight Committee Republican member told MailOnline on Thursday morning. 'Why would we trust that another agency in the same administration will behave any better?' Lerner raised the GOP's temperature at a May 2013 committee hearing when she offered a self-serving opening statement before refusing to answer questions, citing her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Attorneys working for the committee's GOP majority later determined that she had waived that right by offering an oral defense that wasn't subject to cross-examination. Republicans have since pushed a Contempt of Congress resolution through the House of Representatives, citing her refusal to answer questions while under subpoena. One conservative member, Steve Stockman of Texas, proposed last week that the House sergeant-at-arms should arrest her.","Deputy attorney general testifies that the DOJ is looking into the 2011 disappearance of years of Lerner's emails following a hard drive crash .

"A huge crackdown on Occupy Boston’s second campsite by hundreds of police officers saw around 100 protesters arrested and their tents and personal belongings reportedly thrown into bins. They were arrested early this morning around 1:30am after they ignored warnings to move from a downtown greenway near where they have been camped out for more than a week, police said. The protesters, part of the national Occupy Wall Street movement, had tried to expand from their original site in Dewey Square to a second site across the street, along the Rose Kennedy Greenway. On the floor: This protestor was one of around 100 arrested early on Tuesday morning after police cracked down on an Occupy Boston camp . Grabbed: These protesters were taken away from a section of the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Parkway . Force required: Many of the protesters refused to move from the camp and had to be forcibly removed by cops . Grounded: Protesters are arrested in Boston, after tensions boiled over on Tuesday morning when police arrested about 100 protesters from the Occupy Boston movement after the group expanded its camp . Taken away: Police arrested the huge number of protesters after they refused to move from their camp . Police said six protesters were arrested on Tuesday for demonstrating inside a U.S. Senate office building in Washington D.C. The U.S. Capitol Police said the protesters were charged with unlawful conduct for protesting inside the Hart Senate Office Building, where some senators have offices. Video footage from television news stations shows the demonstrators attempted to unfurl a banner inside the building that said 'Tax the Rich'. The banner was grabbed by a police officer, and the protesters were arrested. A local conservancy group recently planted $150,000 worth of shrubs along the greenway and officials said they were concerned about damage. The arrests were mostly for trespassing. Police had warned protesters for hours they would have to return to Dewey Square, where a tent city has been steadily growing, and issued leaflets saying protesters could not occupy the greenway. Around 10 police officers were patrolling the greenway early on Tuesday - some with dogs. Police had at first asked them to leave as the park closes to the public at 11pm. There had been around 300 protesters on the site as of midnight, reported the Boston Herald, which put the arrest figure at around 100. There were around 200 police officers involved in arrest efforts. Big effort: A protester (centre) is arrested in Boston after police cracked down on the demonstrators' camp .

Pride: Protesters gather under a U.S. flag in Boston as they join in with the Occupy Wall Street movement . Gas mask: Protesters link arms in Boston as tensions boiled over when the arrests were made . In Seattle, participants in a protest in downtown Westlake Park said on Monday night that they were told the park was closed and they could have been arrested if they remained. Protesters said they heard from the mayor's office that there were not supposed to be any arrests but from Seattle police on the scene that there might be. No arrests were made. Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn urged protesters to fight for jobs and justice but insisted the city needs to keep the park open for all and to lessen the impact on nearby businesses. The protest is now in its second week in Seattle and continues to gather pace. Protesters who went to a nearby police station to bail people out did not find anyone there, and by 4am they had returned to their encampment to discuss how to raise $4,000 in bail money. Boston resident Matt Hollander, 25, said a group of veterans carrying American flags were standing in between police and the protesters when officers advanced on them. He claimed one veteran was pushed over and a group of protesters fell in a heap. ‘If they wanted to arrest us they could have done that without pushing us - without tramping the flag,’ he said. Protester Shawdeen Vatan, 21, of Arlington, Massachusetts, was not surprised. ‘We're being seen as a legitimate organisation,’ she said. ‘People are panicking and trying to get us out of here.’ Chants: Demonstrators with 'Occupy Boston' march towards the police station where fellow demonstrators were brought after police arrested people sleeping in an expansion of the Occupy Boston tent village . Cold: A demonstrator wrapped in a blanket sits at the edge of the tent village early on Tuesday. Police arrested people sleeping in an expansion of the campsite on an adjacent parcel of the Rose Kennedy Greenway .

There were no arrests in an earlier standoff, where hundreds of students from 10 colleges marched on Monday, briefly confronting police while attempting to hang a banner on a Boston bridge. 'We're being seen as a legitimate organisation. People are panicking and trying to get us out of here' Shawdeen Vatan, 21 . The protesters gathered on Boston Common and marched in front of the Massachusetts Statehouse carrying signs that read ‘Apathy isn't working, Raise your voice’. They chanted slogans like ‘Fund education, not corporations’ and ‘We got sold out. Rich got bailed out’. They later marched to a Charlestown bridge near the city's North End hoping to hang a banner. Shouting: A woman with a loudspeaker addresses fellow demonstrators with the Occupy Boston group as they briefly blocked Summer Street in Boston on Monday afternoon . On the move: Demonstrators with Occupy Boston march through Boston in the sunshine on Monday . Student movement: Demonstrators with Occupy Boston march through Boston Common on Monday . Sat-down: Demonstrators with Occupy Boston stop on Washington Street during a march through Boston . Police blocked the bridge, which was closed for about an hour before the protesters dispersed. Two demonstrators appeared to scuffle with officers during the standoff. Police reported no arrests. The protesters on Wall Street and other cities have described themselves at the ‘99 per cent’. This is referring to what they say are the vast number of Americans struggling to pay their bills while the income gap between the rich and middle class widens.","Occupy Boston demonstrators had tried to move into second campsite .

"The 'common sense' guide has been issued to minimise the risk of contamination of Ebola in the event the virus reaches the UK . Staff at GP practices across the country have been provided with a ‘common sense’ guide to dealing with patients suspected of having Ebola. The step-by-step advice, provided by the Royal College of General Practitioners, has been designed to minimise the risk of the infection spreading in the event it reaches the UK. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned the country to expect a 'handful' of cases by Christmas. The guidance, presented in the form of an index card, has been designed to ensure that patients receive the best and fastest care possible whilst protecting practice teams from possible contamination. It is tailored to individual members of GP practice teams, including receptionists and telephone call handlers, practice managers, and duty doctors. Each 'Ebola Action Card' outlines their specific duties and responsibilities if a patient arrives with Ebola-type symptoms or rings the surgery for advice. Patient advice is also included, with recommendations for what to do if they are in a GP practice or at home. Any patient who arrives with a potential case of Ebola will be told to go to an isolation room and will then be assessed by the duty doctor over an internal phone system. If Ebola is a serious possibility, doctors are asked to alert an infectious-disease specialist at the nearest hospital. Compiled by Dr Simon Stockley, a GP from Stockton-On-Tees, the cards provide a practical and common-sense approach to the current crisis, as well as much-needed reassurance for staff and patients in general practice. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned the UK should expect a 'handful' of Ebola cases by Christmas . RCGP Chair Dr Maureen Baker said: 'The threat of Ebola to the UK remains low but GPs and practice staff are on the front line of dealing with contagious diseases and they need to be fully aware of what steps to take in order to protect patients and themselves, should an incident or potential incident arise. 'Dr Stockley has an impressive background in emergency preparedness and we are delighted to be working with him on such an important initiative. 'His guidance takes a calm, measured and common sense approach to the current situation – exactly what general practice needs. 'It will reassure all members of the GP practice team and should make all frontline health professionals feel more prepared and confident about handling any potential incident.' The college has set up a dedicated Ebola page on its website, bringing together the latest information on the virus. Last month, Public Health England warned GP surgeries and walk-in centres they would have to be temporarily closed if patients with bleeding, vomiting or diarrhoea are suspected of having Ebola. Staff from North East Ambulance Service and the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle carry out a Ebola exercise . Ebola is a viral infection currently present in West Africa. It is infectious and potentially fatal. Where possible it is important that patients are assessed where they present least risk to health workers.

Albion had hoped that the striker, who has scored 14 goals in all competitions this season, would concentrate on their battle for Premier League survival after receiving a 12-month ban for drink-driving. West Brom are willing to sell the striker for around £20m in the summer . Tony Pulis will be looking for Berahino to keep his West Brom side in the Barclays Premier League . Berahino said in the interview: ‘I’m taking care of my short-term goals right now and if I keep scoring goals and doing well for West Brom, I know the future will be bright for me and I’ll go a long way. ‘I need to stay focused on what I’m doing right now, which is scoring the goals and keeping West Brom in the Premier League. If I can keep them up and score as many goals as I can, I’m pretty sure the fans wouldn’t mind me pushing on and moving on to bigger things.’ Albion go to Burnley on Sunday in the Barclays Premier League, three points above the relegation zone.","Saido Berahino said he wanted to help West Brom stay up, then move on .

"Angry: Lyndsey Glassett claims her sister, who lives in the flat above her, deliberately sabotaged her Jerusalem artichokes ‘out of spite’ When Lyndsey Glassett returned home from a weekend away she was devastated to find that her beloved Jerusalem artichoke plants were all dying. The 67-year-old liked to grow them to cook with, stewing them for hours in wine or grating them into salads. But in the space of just a weekend their leaves had turned black and withered and they were on the brink of death. When she reviewed her CCTV footage, she discovered the culprit appeared to be the woman who lived in the flat upstairs. This was no ordinary neighbourly dispute, however – for that woman was her younger sister, Gillian Leeden. The incident has now led to a legal battle between the two sisters. Mrs Glassett believes her sister deliberately targeted the plants she had spent two years growing in their mother’s garden. But her sister’s defence is that she mistook the plants for weeds and she was clearing them away. The 62-year-old registered nurse is now facing criminal charges after she was allegedly captured spraying ‘weed killer’ over the vegetables. Mrs Glassett claims that her sister killed the Jerusalem artichokes ‘out of spite’, as ‘part of an ongoing harassment’ towards her. The pair had been at loggerheads for years but things came to a head after Mrs Glassett returned to their home town of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, in 2009 after living in France for five years. Twice-divorced Mrs Glassett moved into her mother’s maisonette, which is below Mrs Leeden’s flat, and turned her garden into an allotment, planting beans, peas, lettuce, radish, tomatoes and her prized Jerusalem artichokes. Mrs Glassett said: ‘They are not widely available to purchase in shops in England. I had grown them in France and both my mother and I enjoyed eating them. I used them for soup, I grated them raw into salads, and tossed in butter after steaming in wine and herbs. Accused: Gillian Leeden, 62, is facing a charge of criminal damage but insists she sprayed the artichokes with weedkiller thinking they were weeds. The plants were growing in the bed pictured . ‘There were far too many artichokes for our sole use and I gave many of them to friends and neighbours. ‘I believe Gillian Leeden killed my artichokes deliberately. I was due to move out less than a month from when she did this so I don’t know why she could not have waited for me to remove my plants.’ She claims their relationship hit rock bottom when she moved in with their mother Jean, who passed away weeks before the artichoke incident. Mrs Glassett, a retired chiropodist, said in a witness statement: ‘There is a lot of history behind why I no longer speak with Gillian but we have not spoken since December 2010. We do not see eye to eye.’ Prized: Mrs Glassett takes great care of her Jerusalem artichokes and likes to use them for cooking . Mrs Leeden, a twice-divorced mother of two, will now stand trial after pleading not guilty to criminal damage at Stevenage Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday. Rufia Khatum, prosecuting, said that Mrs Leeden claims she could not have intended to damage the artichokes because she thought they were weeds. She said: ‘The issue for the trial is one of lawful excuse, the defendant denies mens rea [guilty intent] and [claims] the items did not belong to the alleged party.’ Court clerk Denise Coster added: ‘She does not accept that she damaged the artichoke plants... She didn’t think they were a cultivated plant, simply that they were weeds.’","Lyndsey Glassett, 67, horrified to find beloved Jerusalem artichokes dying .

"With constant daily reminders on the radio, weather updates can sometimes fall on deaf ears. But police in Surrey made sure their messages were heard loud and clear on Thursday, by rapping their way through road safety rules in a string of Twitter posts. Officers took to the site to advise motorists, taking inspiration from the 1993 song, Boom! Shake the Room! Surrey Police got their message across loud and clear in a series of 90s style raps on Thursday . A spokesman for Surrey Police said they were glad to be able to inject 'humour and humanity' into their road safety warnings . Officers rhymed their road safety guidelines on the micro-blogging site to the entertainment of hundreds of other users . In an homage to the No 1 hit by The Fresh Prince and DJ Jazzy Jeff, officers posted: 'Yo, back up now and give a brother room. The roads are wet and . you're about to go #boom.' They continued: 'Hyped up, psyched up, slipping ‘n’ sliding, Standing water is a risk for colliding #boom', to the entertainment of hundreds on the micro-blogging site. Their finale mimicked the song's chorus, warning: '#Boom brake-brake-brakes need room...Back-back-back-back-Vroom!'. Surrey police also took to Twitter in December to warn drivers of road ice in a version of 80s song Ice Ice Baby . The posts took inspiration from a 1993 Fresh Prince song . They were applauded by Twitter users who appreciated their unusual campaign to improve road safety. But critics questioned whether it was a good use of police time posting such a bizarre message. A spokesman for Surrey Police told Metro: 'Surrey Police is always working to keep people safe and where we can insert some humour and humanity into our safety messages it seems to help them spread further'. 'Love it or hate it, the aim of the rap is to get people talking and thinking about road safety and if it prevents someone from getting injured then job done!' 'Hopefully it raised a few smiles on a wet Friday morning!' This is the second time the officers have rapped their way through weather updates, after taking on the 1980s Vanilla Ice hit, Ice Ice Baby, in December to warn drivers of frosty road conditions. They posted their Tweets after heavy fog caused a massive car pile up in Kent on Wednesday morning which officers described as the worst accident to have ever been caused by fog on British roads. More than 200 people were injured in the accident which saw 100 cars pile on top of one another along a 500 yard stretch of busy road.","Surrey Police post string of raps to spread road safety awareness .

"President Obama opened his heart about the Newtown shooting massacre today, candidly telling NBC's 'Meet the Press' during a televised morning interview that the tragedy represented the, 'worst day of my presidency.' 'The question (sic) becomes whether we are actually shook up enough by what happened here that it does not just become another one of these routine episodes where it gets a lot of attention for a couple of weeks and then drifts away,' the president told host, David Gregory. 'It certainly won't feel like that to me. 'This is something that, you know, that was the worst day of my presidency. And it's not something that I want to see repeated.' Obama referenced an iconic Oval Office . predecessor who also confronted entrenched and accepted traditions that . many felt had to change in the interest of the public good . President Obama appeared on 'Meet the Press' this morning to discuss his plans for gun control across the United States in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre .

'It is not enough for us to say, 'This is too hard so we're not going to try,' Obama said. 'So what I . intend to do is I will call all the stakeholders together. I will meet . with Republicans. I will meet with Democrats. I will talk to anybody.' When Gregory expressed skepticism he could galvanize Americans on the the issue of gun control, Obama referenced an iconic Oval Office predecessor who also confronted entrenched and accepted traditions that many felt had to change in the interest of the public good. 'This is not going to be simply a matter of me spending political capital,' Obama said.

"Loss: Sabeen Thandi was strangled to death by Mohammed Badiuzzaman, who was arrested for threatening to kill her two weeks before she died . Police officers are under investigation after a man who was arrested for threatening to kill his pregnant wife was released and went on to murder her two weeks later. Mohammed Badiuzzaman, 34, pleaded guilty to murdering mother-of-three Sabeen Thandi at the Old Bailey yesterday. Police said he had become enraged after discovering she had entered into another relationship. It is not known who the father of her unborn child is. Badiuzzaman, of Forest Gate, east London, forced his 37-year-old wife to wear a hijab after pressuring her into an Islamic marriage. He forbade her from going out on her own even when she had to travel to work as a doctor's receptionist. The security guard even tried to sell her home by visiting an estate agents and pretending he owned the property. The couple had started dating in November 2012 and Badiuzzaman moved in with Ms Thandi two months later. But she became fed up with his controlling behaviour and visited a solicitors in Watford in June because she wanted a divorce. Ms Thandi was terrified of her abusive husband and feared for her and her children's safety. On June 17 Watford County Court made a non-molestation order against Badiuzzaman banning him from entering his wife's home. But two days later he forced her to drive to her lawyer's office to have the order revoked. He threatened that if she did not do as he said she would 'never see her son again'. Ms Thandi's solicitors phoned the police and Badiuzzaman was arrested on suspicion of threats to kill and unlawful imprisonment, but he was later released. Police went to the house in Forest Gate in the early hours of July 7 last year after receiving a silent 999 call. Badiuzzaman answered the door and told officers his wife was still at work, but when they searched the property they found her lifeless body under a duvet in the bedroom. Badiuzzaman, 34, is facing life in prison after pleading guilty to the murder . Ms Thandi was taken to Newham University Hospital where she was confirmed dead. A post-mortem gave the cause of death as strangulation. Officer in the case, Detective Inspector Euan McKeeve said: 'This tragedy has left three children without a loving mother in the prime of her life.' Hertfordshire Police and the Met Police are now being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) in relation to the incident. An IPCC spokesperson said: 'The investigation is nearing conclusion, with most lines of enquiry completed by investigators. 'We have interviewed ten officers and a civilian staff member from the Metropolitan Police Service under misconduct caution, in relation to their contact with Mrs Thandi prior to her death on 7 July 2013. 'Two officers from Hertfordshire Constabulary have also been interviewed under misconduct caution, in relation to their contact with Mrs Thandi on 19 June 2013. 'We have also taken statements from several independent witnesses, and are keeping the family updated on the progress of our investigation.' Badiuzzaman admitted murder and was remanded in custody ahead of sentence on May 27.

"The number of unaccompanied minors entering the United States via Mexico has now exceeded 60,0000. According to Homeland Security figures, the number of young Central Americans who have crossed into the U.S. reached 62,000 at the end of last week. The flood of unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, has caused a humanitarian crisis for the Obama administration.

Here, Honduran immigrants Maria Celeste Castro and her daughter Melida Patricio, two, wait as a Border Patrol vehicle arrives to transport their group to a processing center after they crossed the Rio Grande into Texas on July 24 . It's also caused a budget dilemma, with the number of unaccompanied minors likely to reach 90,000, a significant increase on the 38,293 of the previous two years combined. reports CNN. Housing so many children, some as young as three, has caused overcrowding at federal facilities and now taxpayer-funded private facilities are being used to care for the children pending the determination of their immigration status. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), an arm of the Health and Human Service Department, is responsible for the care of the children after they are apprehended, but with state shelters full, private facilities are receiving millions in taxpayer dollars to take on the overflow. Ebb: According to officials, the tide of immigrants is beginning to slow. Here, Honduran undocumented immigrant Laura Fabio, two, waits for her mother after they crossed the Rio Grande illegally into the United States on July 24 . CBS reports that Southwest Key is one such company. It operates 25 shelters in 15 cities in Texas, Arizona and California that provide legal and medical services as well as schooling. The ORR aims to resolve a child's immigration status within 45 days. On Friday, House Republicans managed to pass two bills to force the White House to deal with the child migrant surge more speedily. The bills would provide emergency funding, faster deportations and rescind President Obama's authority to decide the fate of certain illegal immigrants. The bills, strongly opposed by the White House and most Democrats, is unlikely to become law, reports the Washington Post.

"If you've ever been in a stadium during a sporting event, you'll know it can feel like the ground beneath your feet is moving when people celebrate a major moment. But scientists think this is literally happening at certain events - with particularly rowdy fans causing minor earthquakes. And this weekend they will perform the most accurate study yet, at an American football game, to see how big the earthquakes caused really are. Scroll down for video . Scientists from University of Washington will use sensors to see the strength of earthquakes caused by cheering fans (CenturyLink Field stadium shown). The experiment will take place at an American football game in Seattle on Sunday. They hope to get readings 10 times more reliable than before . The scientists from the University of Washington and the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network will perform the study at a game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Carolina Panthers at 5:15pm local time on Sunday 11 January. Taking place at the CenturyLink Field in downtown Seattle, 67,000 fans are expected to be present and roaring their team to victory. Using sensors strategically placed around the stadium, the researchers will then measure how the extent of their cheering and stamping. University of Washington scientists with the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network installed three instruments in the stadium yesterday - two up in the stands and one by the playing field. Seismologists have used such instruments at the stadium in the past, but this year's experiment features faster connectivity and readings. A new tool called 'QuickShake' is expected to display vibrations within three seconds, which is five to 10 times faster than the tool used with the sensors last year, the scientists said. If a big plays prompts a fan quake, viewers monitoring the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network's webpage will see the activity before they see it on television, which has about a 10-second delay during broadcast. 'The Seahawks experiment should provide us and the internet-connected public with a feel for the minimum time early warning might provide,' said Dr Steve Malone, a UW professor emeritus of Earth and space sciences. The researchers will also use a website called QuickShake to gather data from fans. Scientists first got interested in football when a seismometer a block away from the stadium showed vibrations during a 'legendary' touchdown by Seattle's Marshawn Lynch on 8 January 2011. This resulted in what is now called a 'Beast Quake' - when the energetic jumping and stomping of so many fans at once shook the stadium and reverberated through the surrounding soil. Previous studies by the scientists have shown the quake produced can be a magnitude one or two. Now they hope to gather data that is ten times more reliable than some they gathered last year. 'We're mostly interested in the speed and the reliability of the communications,' said Dr John Vidale, a UW professor of Earth and space sciences and director of the seismic network. 'It's hard to simulate thousands of people using this tool all at once. When we can get a lot of people looking, we can see problems that we'd encounter during an actual earthquake.' The researchers will use a website called QuickShake to gather data from fans from three sensors (shown). Scientists first got interested in football when a seismometer a block away from the stadium showed vibrations during a 'legendary' touchdown by Seattle's Marshawn Lynch on 8 January 2011 . The scientists will be hoping for some 'groundbreaking' moments in the game this Sunday to put their sensors to the test. Pictured is Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Ricardo Lockette carrying the ball against the New Orleans Saints in the second half of a game in December 2013 . The foot-stomping is a real-world test of technology to detect the bigger shaking that originates underground. The seismic group is working with the US Geological Survey (USGS) to offer early warnings for the Pacific Northwest that could provide tens of seconds to several minutes' notice of an incoming strong shaking. This year some public agencies and large businesses will have a first chance to try out the system that will eventually be available to the public. 'The Seahawks experiment should provide us and the internet-connected public with a feel for the minimum time early warning might provide,' said Dr Steve Malone, a UW professor emeritus of Earth & space sciences. 'In this case it's football fan activity that generates a signal as a warning for what shows up on TV some seconds later. In the future, it might be seconds to minutes of warning after an earthquake starts.' The scientists from the University of Washington and the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network will perform the study at a game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Carolina Panthers at 5:15pm local time on Sunday 11 January at the CenturyLink Field stadium (shown) in downtown Seattle, with 67,000 fans expected . As several pieces of seismic monitoring equipment sit on the floor, a scientist does a 'stomp test' to check the gear at the Seattle Seahawks' field, CenturyLink Field yesterday. Scientists with the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network installed the instruments to record expected vibrations from jumping and stomping fans . This weekend the group will be beefing up its social-media presence to post updates and respond to questions during the game. That also helps get ready for an emergency situation. 'During the rumblings on Mount St Helens a decade ago there was a huge influx of web visits and phone calls,' Dr Malone said. 'Now with social media, it's a whole new ballgame. We've got to learn how to deal with that because it's going to snow us over if we're not prepared.' The group will have more staff monitoring social media during the game, and more robust websites that they hope won't slow down or crash during heavy traffic. On the scientific side, they hope to explore the different readings between the three sensors placed at different levels. They also hope to explain some mysterious patterns of shaking during commercial breaks, what one researcher says may be a 'dance quake.' Several researchers will be at the UW campus lab Saturday monitoring the sensors. Two group members will be at the stadium providing eyes on the ground to help explain what could be causing any unusual spikes. 'We're developing these new web tools, and monitoring the game really motivates everyone to get excited,' Dr Vidale said, 'and we're rooting for a second helping of roars and rumbles against the Packers or Cowboys to perfect the system.'","Scientists from University of Washington will use sensors to see the strength of earthquakes caused by cheering fans .

"A cargo ship that was stranded for nearly three weeks after it was beached on a sandbank has finally docked after being towed back to port. The 51,000-tonne Hoegh Osaka, which is carrying more than £30million worth of cargo, was grounded deliberately on a sandbar as it left Southampton on January 3 after it started listing dangerously in a busy shipping lane with 25 crew aboard. The multi-million pound plan to re-right the 15-year-old ship - which needed to be done before it could be brought back to port - has faced a number of delays caused  by heavy winds and stormy weather. But today the salvage team working on the ship successfully reduced its listing to five degrees - allowing the Singapore-registered vessel to be towed back into Southampton, where it arrived shortly after 5.30pm. Scroll down for video . Arrival: The car-carrier was towed into Southampton port shortly before 7pm, ending a salvage operation that lasted nearly three weeks . Next step: The state of the cargo, which includes luxury cars and pieces of heavy machinery, will now be assessed for damage . Success: Hundreds of onlookers flocked to the banks of Southampton  to see the vessel complete its three-hour journey back to port . Hundreds of onlookers flocked to the banks of Southampton Water to see the vessel complete its three-hour journey back to port guided by four tugs. Marketing executive Jason Mumford, 40, from Southampton, left work an hour early so he could watch the Hoegh Osaka being towed back in. He said: 'It's great to see it being moved from the Solent, especially after nearly three weeks virtually on its side in the water. 'You could still see a very slight list but other than that it looks like any other ship coming into Southampton.' After the vessel beached, the 24 crew members and the pilot were evacuated from the leaning vessel during darkness in a dramatic air and sea rescue operation. At the time, 591ft ship was listing at 52 degrees. Four days later the ship, which sailing to Bremerhaven, Germany, floated free from the sandbank on high tide and has since been anchored at a spot two miles east called Alpha Anchorage, near Lee-on-the-Solent. The 19-day salvage operation was hampered by heavy winds, which were so strong during one storm that they even caused one of the tugs to collide with the vessel.

Salvaged: Onlookers gathered on the seafront in Calshot, Hampshire, to watch the vessel as it was towed back to port in Southampton . An excavator that was on board shifted during the sailing and punched a hole in the side of the hull, which was quickly repaired. But some 3,000 tonnes of water entered the vessel and had to be pumped out and into empty fuel tanks on board. It was only then that salvage firm Svitzer was able to complete ballast management and bring the vessel back to a listing of five degrees. The condition of the cargo, which includes 1,200 Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles, 65 Mini cars and 105 pieces of JCB construction equipment, is not clear but further inspections are due now the ship has berthed. Nearly there: As darkness fell this evning, the ship continued its journey towards Southampton port, towed by a tug (pictured right) New position: Four days after beaching the ship, which sailing to Bremerhaven, Germany, floated free from the sandbank on high tide . Back to shore: Tug boats surround the Singapore-registered vessel as it was brought back to Southampton port this evening . Valuable: The condition of the cargo, which includes 1,200 Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles and 65 Minis, is not yet clear . Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention (Sosrep), had said the vessel could not be brought back into port until the list had been sufficiently reduced. He explained this was to ensure the cargo hold doors could be opened in order for the cars and other vehicles to be discharged when it was brought alongside. However, early today it was decided that it was ready to head back to Southampton Port. During its journey, an exclusion zone around the vessel was in place, set at 1,000 metres ahead and behind and 100 metres either side. Righted: The ship needed to reach a list of five degrees before it could be brought back, so that cargo doors could be open in port . Operation: Salvage crews working in the Solent have been removing water from the vessel's car decks and managing its ballast . Progress: The ship, pictured on its journey back to Southampton Port, docked shortly after 5.30pm - more than an hour ahead of schedule . Frantic effort: The stricken ship was listing at 52 degrees when it was beached on January 3. Above, it was towed to an anchor point . Airspace around the cargo ship was also be restricted to one mile either side of the route as a safety precaution. An MCA spokeswoman said earlier today: 'The Hoegh Osaka is scheduled to arrive at Berth 101 in Southampton Port at 7pm. 'During the towing operation to bring the Hoegh Osaka in to Southampton Port, a restricted airspace (temporary) will be placed one mile either side of the navigation route and up to 2,000ft. This is designed to provide essential safety during the towing operation. 'There will also be an exclusion zone around the vessel itself of 3,280ft  ahead and behind and 328ft either side.'","Hoegh Osaka ran aground as it left Southampton for Bremerhaven, Germany, on January 3 with 25 crew aboard .
The 51,000-tonne ship was steered deliberately towards sandbar after it began to list severely shortly after leaving .
Multi-million pound plan to re-right the ship - which needed to be done before it could be towed - faced major delays .
But it has now been towed back to Southampton after salvage crew achieved necessary five-degree listing today ."
"A hidden village which has rarely been seen since the 1930s is slowly rising from its watery grave. Mardale Green , in Cumbria, disappeared in 1935 when the valley was flooded to make way for the Haweswater Reservoir, which would later serve Manchester with water. Hundreds of people were evicted from their homes and most of the village's buildings were blown up by Royal Engineers who used them for demolition practice. Scroll down for video . With the warmest September since 1960, the small Cumbrian village of Mardale Green - that has rarely been seen since the 1930s when it was flooded by the Manchester Water Authority to make way for Haweswater Reservoir - is rising from its watery grave . Farm buildings, pubs and even a church and its graveyard were dismantled stone-by-stone. Meanwhile, coffins were removed from the graveyard and buried elsewhere. The stones from construction sites were re-used to build the water  tower, now situated along the Western shore of the reservoir. But nearly 80 years on, water levels at the Haweswater reservoir are starting to drop significantly due to the lack of rain during the recent dry summer months. The remains of the ancient structures, including farm gates and tree stumps, have now been revealed beside the receding waterline.

"Another hotel masseur is claiming he had a homosexual tryst with John Travolta. Unlike the first two – one of whom withdrew his lawsuit on Tuesday and the first accuser who dropped his case – this latest man to come forward with gay sex claims involving the actor is named. Former massage therapist Luis Gonzalez said he spent an afternoon with the Pulp Fiction star at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Laguna Niguel, California, in 1997. Meanwhile, another unnamed man has made claims today that Travolta accosted him - making it the fifth man to make allegations about the star. More claims: A named hotel masseur is alleging he had a homosexual encounter with John Travolta at a hotel in California back in 1997 . The man - a gym employee - has accused Travolta of fondling him against his wishes when he worked out at the gym while he was shooting a movie, according to RadarOnline. However no details were reported regarding the time frame or location. Travolta's lawyer Marty Singer has denied the allegations. Last week Fabian Zanzi became the third man to accuse Travolta of accosting him back in 2009 while he was working on the Royal Caribbean cruise ship. Gonzalez made his claims to the National Enquirer magazine in the US, saying of the actor: 'He’s a great kisser. I know because I had sex with him and he loved it.’ He added that the 58-year-old married actor seemed 'very experienced’ at gay sex. 'I can remember it like it happened yesterday,’ he added. The masseur said the rendezvous started minutes after he set up his table in Mr Travolta’s room. Scenic: Former massage therapist Luis Gonzalez said he spent an afternoon with the Pulp Fiction star at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Laguna Niguel . The actor reportedly stripped down and said it was too warm for a top sheet. Mr Gonzalez described how Travolta became aroused soon after lying on the table. 'He moved around and started to breathe heavily,' he recalled. 'We got right into the bed that was right there next to the massage table and had a really good time.’ The 49-year-old, who is now living overseas, said he had massaged the actor several times since first meeting him in 1988 without anything sexual happening. The first masseur - dubbed John Doe#1 - has now called in celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred after dropping the lawsuit earlier this week . 'Travolta may not identify himself as a gay man, but it doesn’t dismiss the fact that he likes sex with men .. and he’s experienced at it,’ he said. 'I was in shock for about a week afterward thinking, 'I can’t believe it! I had sex with John Travolta!' 'I was hoping to see him again after that, but I never did,’ he told the Enquirer. The first masseur who claimed last week that he was groped by Mr Travolta during a private massage in Beverly Hills in January was forced to drop his case after it emerged that the actor was 3,000 miles away in New York at the time of the alleged incident. But he hired celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred yesterday and was said to be considering whether or not to refile the lawsuit. 'We are in the process of conferring with him regarding the next steps, which he may wish to take,’ Ms Allred said yesterday. The other massage therapist accused Mr. Travolta of sexual misconduct at an Atlanta hotel in January. The star’s lawyer has denied the claims.

"A pub landlord hid the body of a dead customer for four days so he would not miss the busy weekend trade. Jason Chidgey, 29, found the body of pub regular Mark Howells dead in the men’s toilets on a Friday night at his pub, the Boot Hotel in Aberdare, South Wales. But fearing police would close down the pub for their investigation, meaning he would miss out on weekend business he could not afford to, he hid the body of the 48-year-old in a first-floor bedroom at the pub, Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard. Body hidden for four days: Pub landlord Jason Chidgey hid the body of pub patron Mark Howell in a first floor bedroom after he died in the men's toilets at the Boot Hotel in South Wales . The father-of-two from Parc Glas, Aberdare, enlisted the help of pub cleaner Audra Rees to hide Mr Howell’s body and opened the pub as normal over the weekend. He then arranged for the corpse to be found the following Tuesday. Prosecutor Owen Williams said: ‘He did so to trade over the busy weekend period. ‘He didn't want the body to be found until after the weekend was over. ‘From Friday to Monday Chidgey carried out his business as if nothing untoward had occurred. ‘He deflected friends' concerns about Mr Howells not being seen by saying he had spoken with him recently and that he was okay.’ The court heard that Chidgey almost got away with the scheme until Mrs Rees went to police after Mr Howell’s funeral. 'Blatant dishonesty': Prosecutors at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court (pictured) said police found evidence of her travels at home . Mrs Rees was ‘suffering nightmares’ about the customer’s body in the upstairs room of the pub and made a full statement about the night of January 28 to police, the court heard. Chidgey was jailed for 15 months after admitting perverting the course of justice. Judge Richard Twomlow told him: ‘You showed no respect for Mr Howells. 'Your response to the probation officer is one that shows not a shred of real remorse. 'All you seem to have been concerned about is making things less serious for yourself.' The court heard Mr Howells died of natural causes due to alcohol poisoning. After the case, Mr Howell's family thanked police and the courts for giving them the justice they deserved.","Jason Chidgey hid the body of patron Mark Howells for four days after he died in his pub .

"Fears are rising that the deadly Ebola virus could be on its way to Britain after experts warned it could spread into the UK through meat. Professors said ‘bush meat’ which has been smuggled into Britain could be carrying the virus, which has already killed at least 672 people in West Africa. One scientist said the meat could ‘end up in a market stall in London’ as authorities across the country remained on high alert for the killer disease. Scroll down for videos . Professors said ‘bush meat’ which has been smuggled from Africa (above) into Britain could be carrying the deadly Ebola virus, which has already claimed the lives of at least 672 people in West Africa since February . Health officials remain on high alert amid fears the deadly virus could spread to Britain. Doctors have been told to look out for symptoms of the disease and travellers will not be allowed on flights to the UK if they are unwell . It is feared the bug, which kills up to 90 per cent of its victims, could have contaminated the thousands of pieces of meat which are smuggled into the UK and sold illegally to butchers and markets each year. While the meat is often disguised as beef, it is often found to actually be the meat of wild animals such as rat, chimpanzee or antelope. Professor Robert Dingwall, an expert in infectious diseases at Nottingham Trent University, told The Sun: ‘Lots of wild animals carry the virus, and bush meat is often badly prepared. ‘Similar meat that could have caused this outbreak may well end up in a market stall in London.’ Humans can contract Ebola from eating or handling infected meat from chimpanzees, fruit bats, forest antelopes and porcupines. Of the 7,500 tonnes of illegal meat that enters the country every year,  55 per cent is said to be 'bush meat', which is then distributed through wholesalers or at local markets. The latest warning comes as British airports and airlines remain on high alert to prevent travellers bringing the deadly virus back to the UK. The latest outbreak of Ebola, which began in February, is the most severe since the disease was discovered in 1976. So far the disease has spread from a village in Guinea to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria in West Africa . U.S. citizen Patrick Sawyer (pictured with his daughter Ava) died in the Nigerian capital of Lagos after becoming infected with Ebola. His death has prompted fears of a global pandemic after he flew from Liberia to Nigeria . Measures are in place to ensure that passengers showing symptoms of the bug are barred from boarding flights heading to the UK. Anyone who appears ill on arrival into Britain will be held at immigration before being quarantined in highly secure isolation units, such as those at the Royal Free Hospital in North London. However, because it takes up to three weeks for symptoms to appear, there are fears some victims will slip through the net. Nearly 7,500 tons of illegal meat enters Britain each year – including cuts from exotic animals disguised as beef. The charity Born Free Wild says animals from all over Africa, from giraffe to zebra, and even endangered species such as gorillas and elephants, are snared by poachers, butchered, and then transported to city markets and restaurants across the globe. Bush meat is also smuggled into the UK hidden in suitcases by African travellers visiting relatives. Favoured delicacies include fruit bats the size of a small cat, antelope and cane rats. Much will be dried or smoked but some will be raw and could carry infections such as Ebola or HIV. In 2012, an undercover investigation by the BBC revealed cane rats and ‘smokies’ – charred skin-on sheep or goat meat – on sale in a north-east London market. A year earlier, trading standards officers in the Midlands seized chimpanzee meat believed to be destined for restaurants. Doctors have been told to look out for symptoms of the disease and travellers returning from West Africa are urged to seek immediate medical help if they develop flu-like symptoms. One of the deadliest diseases known to man, Ebola has already claimed more than 672 lives in its worst-ever outbreak. For the first time, the virus has spread out of the countryside to large towns and cities, raising fears it will reach Britain. It can be spread through sweat and saliva and there is no vaccine or cure. Ebola (above) has already killed 672 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria and infected more than 1,200 since it was first diagnosed in February. Symptoms include sudden fever, vomiting and headaches . Medical staff at a clinic on the outskirts of Kenema, Sierra Leone have been treating patients with Ebola.  Liberia President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has closed some border crossings and ordered strict quarantines of patients . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who chaired a meeting of the Government’s Cobra emergency committee on the outbreak yesterday, said Ebola was a ‘very serious threat’. But he sought to calm fears, saying it is ‘most unlikely’ that Ebola could spread within the UK because of ‘frankly different’ standards of infection control here. He said the logical approach was to tackle the outbreak at its source in West Africa, adding: ‘We do not, at the moment, think this is an issue that affects the UK directly.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the NHS was looking at its capability and taking ‘precautionary measures’ but he was ‘very confident’ it will be able to cope if the disease arrived in the UK. The outbreak started in Guinea in February and spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone within weeks. Samaritan's Purse medical staff had to spray disinfectant on a person who died from Ebola in Foya, Liberia . Health workers in protective gear carry a victim of the Ebola outbreak in Lofa, Liberia . Fears grew last week that it could spread internationally following the death of an American finance consultant in the Nigerian city of Lagos - Africa’s biggest and most densely populated metropolis and an international transport hub. Patrick Sawyer, 40, had been on his way back to the US after attending the funeral of his sister in Liberia. She had also died from the disease. The Foreign Office has confirmed it is prepared for a potential outbreak in the UK, saying ‘the Government is confident the UK has experienced people who are ready to deal with anything if it were to arrive here’. It added: ‘We have experienced scientists and doctors – the Royal Free Infectious Disease Unit, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine – and a lot of experience of dealing with dangerous diseases. The risk of this disease spreading fast in the UK is much lower because of that.’ What is Ebola? Ebola is a virus that causes a potentially lethal illness called hemorrhagic fever. This makes the body’s blood vessels porous and they start to leak, causing catastrophic internal bleeding. Up to nine out of ten people who contract the virus will die without immediate medical attention. The virus emerged in 1976 in an isolated village near the Ebola river in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Why is the Government suddenly worried? Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond chaired an emergency Cobra meeting on the issue yesterday because there are growing fears that the virus could enter Britain from Africa. The latest outbreak in West Africa is the worst on record – killing more than 670 people – and is also the first to affect people in cities and not just remote villages. In Guinea, the epidemic has reached the capital, Conakry. What are the symptoms? Dr Tom Fletcher of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who has treated victims in Guinea and Sierra Leone, says: ‘The initial symptoms are quite non-specific and similar to a flu-like illness. They include fever, headache and lethargy. This progresses to severe diarrhoea and vomiting.’ The incubation period for the virus varies from two days to three weeks. Have there been any cases in Britain? No. But Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist from the University of Reading who studies viruses such as Ebola, warns that it is statistically likely the virus will eventually come to the UK. The most immediate danger is that the virus will enter Britain on an airline flight. One victim, American Patrick Sawyer, had symptoms of the virus in Liberia but was allowed to board multiple international flights. Vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea, he flew from Liberia, stopped over in Ghana, changed planes in Togo and died in Nigeria. What is the connection with bush meat? Bush meat refers to any meat obtained from wild animals killed in rainforests. It is thought humans can contract Ebola from eating or handling infected meat from chimpanzees, fruit bats, forest antelopes and porcupines. There are fears that smuggled bush meat might be a route for the virus into Britain – 7,500 tonnes of illegal meat enters the country every year, and 55 per cent is said to be bush meat, which is then distributed through wholesalers or at local markets. How contagious is it? It is less contagious than other diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis, which can spread for considerable distances through the air. Dr Fletcher said: ‘Ebola does not spread through the air. To contract it, you must have contact with an infected person’s blood or other bodily fluids, so the real risk is to family members and care givers.’ Should I worry? ‘The risk of anyone in Britain contracting Ebola is very small,’ stresses Dr Tom Solomon, an expert in viral infection, who is the director of the newly established Health Protection Research Unit. He adds: ‘If the outbreak in Africa is not brought under control, then that would increase the risk to people here.’ What if I think I have been in contact with an infected person? Contact your GP immediately, although the health authorities are keen to avoid everyone who has flown from Africa rushing to their family doctor because it will overwhelm surgeries. If a passenger on a flight is identified as being infected with the virus, every other passenger on that flight will be contacted. How can the disease be treated? There is no cure for Ebola, although scientists across the world are working to develop treatments such as antiviral drugs. Other scientific teams are carrying out studies on antibodies – the body’s immune defence cells – from people who have recovered from the infection and have antibodies in their bodies that may neutralise the virus. ‘Many people do survive,’ says Dr Fletcher. ‘Treatment with drugs such as antibiotics and fluids given through intravenous drips can make a great difference. Loss of fluids is often a killer in Ebola cases. Up to half of patients can survive, if treated properly.’","Professors said 'bush meat' smuggled into UK could be carrying Ebola virus .

"Crime gangs who fill up containers in their vans with stolen fuel to sell on on the black market are putting motorists' lives at risk, police warned today. They say hundreds of thousands of pounds worth . of petrol and diesel is being stolen from fuel stations around the . country. Officers fear many people could be killed if one of the vans crashed on a motorway and have urged other drivers to watch out for the vehicles which have been dubbed ‘molotov motors’. Illegal trade: Police say fuel thieves who fill up plastic containers inside vans are risking a serious explosion . Thieves armed with corporate fuel payment cards are loading rented vans with water containers and then illicitly filling them up. Investigators from City of London Police’s National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) have been increasingly concerned about soaring fuel thefts. They said it is impossible to measure the exact scale of the problem but one company alone has already reported losses of £400,000 this year. Crime gangs, mostly from Eastern Europe and Sri Lanka, are taking advantage of the weaker security on corporate fuel cards which don't have chip and pin technology. They hire long wheelbase vans, often using bogus credit cards, and then fill the back with large water containers, similar to those used by campers. The driver parks as close as possible to the fuel pump and discreetly fills the containers through the sliding passenger door as an accomplice helps from inside. Gangs of fuel thieves are stealing petrol and diesel worth hundreds of thousands of pounds every week . Undercover officers have watched suspects drive long circular routes stopping off at almost every petrol station on the way to fill the maximum amount possible. The vast majority of thefts take place on arterial routes into London, with Northampton and Milton Keynes the worst-hit areas in the country. Thieves regularly travel up and down the M1 and M40, as well as the M3 and M27, stopping off at major towns to visit every petrol station. Posing as tradesmen in fluorescent jackets, they can steal fuel worth £1,500 in one trip before returning to domestic garages to decant and store their haul. In one case police discovered thieves were using a garage underneath a London block of flats to store 800 litres of petrol. Motorists have been warned to keep their eyes peeled for the fuel thieves, who often drive rented vans . When they arrived they found a builder – who did not know about the fuel –smoking a cigarette as he used an electric saw outside. Some of the fuel is sold at cheap rates on the black market, but the majority is handed to corrupt businesses who resell it and share the profit with the thieves. John Unsworth, of the NFIB, said: ‘We have got criminals driving up and down our motorways with all of this fuel sloshing around in the back of their van. ‘There is an extraordinary risk to the general public. One discarded cigarette or an accident could result in catastrophic consequences. ‘At the heart of this crime are fuel cards which are being exploited because they do not have the latest security technology. ‘These criminals are pillaging one community after another, day in, day out. We need people to help us identify them. ‘If fuel station customers or staff spot these vans and people acting suspiciously they should call the police immediately.’ More than 70 people linked to the thefts have been arrested this year as the problem continues to grow. Police also fear that vehicles may be damaged if motorists unwittingly buy bootleg fuel made up of different brands or which is contaminated with moisture. Edmund King, of the AA, said: ‘It is an accident that is without a doubt waiting to happen.  Transporting such large quantities of volatile fuels is incredibly dangerous. ‘It really beggars belief that criminals are going to this extent, putting their lives and those of others at massive risk for the sake of profit. ‘Motorists should never buy cheap fuel. Firstly, it could be contaminated, and secondly it is encouraging this kind of dangerous criminal activity.’","City of London Police's National Fraud Intelligence Bureau warns of gangs .

YouTube-owner Google, has said he would allow extremist websites to . continue being listed because he believes it can help police track . potential terrorists. ‘We . cannot prima facie identify evil and take it down,’ he said at the Hay . literary festival. ‘We have taken the decision that information, if it’s . legal, even if it’s despicable, will be indexed.’ He . went on to argue that extremists are usually possible to detect through . their internet activity and that their online presence can sometimes . help. ‘Extremists are not clever enough not to be found out,’ he added. ‘They leave a digital trail the police can follow.’ On . Saturday the Mail reported how, within hours of Lee Rigby’s execution, . vile messages praising the attack began appearing online. This video shows Anwar al-Awlaki, the dead ideological leader of Al Qaeda, describe how Islam is 'spread by the sword' Mohammad Sidique Khan warns: 'I'm avenging my brothers and sisters. You will be our targets' Police are still investigating if the soldier’s two killers were indoctrinated by videos. But, . despite the pledges by major search engines that they do pull . incendiary videos from their sites, hundreds of Islamist propaganda . videos can easily be found by impressionable young British Muslim men . through simple internet searches. One . hour-long clip tells every Muslim that it is their duty to wage jihad . to follow ‘Allah’s path’. Another video uploaded by extremist terror . sect Al-Shabaab shows a fighter, wearing a balaclava, giving a . demonstration of how to assemble an AK47 assault rifle. Al-Shabaab is . the Islamic terror group in Somalia which Woolwich killer Michael . Adebolajo was attempting to join last year. A . search for Al-Shabaab on YouTube produces 65,000 results. The popular . site also has 108 videos of hate preacher Anjem Choudary. Islamic terror group Al-Shabaab have a training video of how to use an AK-47 automatic assault rifle on the video sharing website. 'Woolwich killer' Adebolajo is believed to have tried to join the group . An hour-long Al Qaeda video says Jihad is the duty of all Muslims. One soldier (pictured) said: 'I extort you to Jihad in Allah' Following the killing of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, radical clerics have posted speeches online saying his murder is revenge for the 'Muslim brothers who have lost their lives in Afghanistan and Iraq' In . his bile-filled rants he urges Muslims to wage jihad while in others he . tells his fanatics to take advantage of the welfare state. Videos of Adebolajo at extremist rallies can also be found. One shows him alongside Choudary. The repulsive martyrdom video of 7/7 bomber Mohammad Sidique Khan is still on YouTube. In another clip, hate preacher Omar Bakri Mohammed praises Adebolajo and describes him as ‘courageous’. A . video of Anwar al-Awlaki, the dead ideological leader of Al Qaeda, . describing how ‘Islam is spread by the sword’ can also be found. Elsewhere on the internet, a magazine written by the Taliban can be found using the Google search engine. The Taliban has published a new English magazine called Azan, which can be found through Google searches . The . first edition of the magazine, published two weeks ago, calls for . extremists in Britain to kill Malala Yousafzai, the 15-year-old . Pakistani girl shot by the Taliban who now lives in this country. Terrorism expert Neil Doyle, who helped the Mail with the investigation, said: ‘These videos are surprisingly easy to find. ‘I . had no trouble finding lots of disturbing footage. There are numerous . videos of beheadings, executions and hate sermons which anyone could . find.’ YouTube says material that is ‘purely of a religious nature’ remains online. However, the company admits that it relies on members of the public to ‘flag up’ incendiary material before it takes action. A YouTube spokesman said: ‘YouTube has community guidelines that prohibit dangerous or illegal activities such as bomb-making, hate speech and incitement to commit violent acts, and we have removed a significant number of videos under these policies. ‘These are difficult issues and material that is brought to our attention is reviewed carefully. 'We will continue to remove all content that incites violence according to our policies. Material of a purely religious nature will remain on the site.’ Labour . MP Paul Flynn, who has led calls for internet giants to do more to . tackle the problem, said the ‘case for controls to be imposed is a . powerful one.’ He said: ‘There is so much stuff on the internet which is damaging. It’s there because we have been much too permissive. ‘I’m . generally against censorship, but the events of the past few days shows . that people who are preaching terrorism should be restricted from . putting this on the internet. ‘The internet is anarchic. There are no natural controls. People are greatly influenced by what they see. There . is a whole encyclopaedia of hate out there which is having a very bad . effect. There is a strong case for forbidding anything that is likely to . incite hatred.’ The Woolwich attack lead to a weekend of clashes as right-wing extremists protested following the death of Drummer Lee Rigby. Police maintained a heavy presence in Newcastle, after around 2,000 English Defence League (EDL) supporters marched through the city and came face to face with anti-fascist campaigners who had organised their own rally. Although the demonstrations from both sides were kept largely under control there were a number of small outbreaks of violence and 24 arrests were made. Three people had been arrested prior to the Newcastle protest on Saturday. In London, the Metropolitan police mobilised more than 1,000 officers, including armed response units and extra patrols who were ready to attend any potential trouble spots. Tell mam, a hotline for recording Islamophobic crimes said there had been 83 new reports of violent threats reported by Muslims to its helpline, compared with the four to eight calls it normally receives a day. The English Defence League held a rally of its followers in the streets of Woolwich on the night of the killing, and mosques have been targeted by far-right extremists around the country. Right-wing extremists including the English Defence League, said they would be holding demonstrations over the coming weeks. Fiyaz Mughal, Co-ordinator of Tell MAMA and Director of Faith Matters said: 'We are calling on police and politicians to do more to tackle this shameful wave of fear and prejudice. 'From the internet, to the workplace, the street and even houses of worship, too often Muslim women and men are becoming the target of vicious, sometimes violent, abuse.'","Hate lectures praising murder of drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich accessible on YouTube .

"A benefits cheat who falsely claimed more than £100,000 by pretending to be blind has been jailed - after he was caught driving and working as a builder. Kelvin Kalloo, 35, slept through his sentencing and could be heard snoring loudly in court as he was jailed for two-and-a-half years for swindling more than £100,000 in disability benefits. Kalloo, of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, also claimed sick pay from the Department of Work and Pensions, where he advised other people how to claim benefits, over a six year period while receiving fraudulent benefits himself. He claimed that he had been partially blinded in a car crash, was unable to walk unaided and was suffering from bone cancer. Jailed: Kelvin Kalloo arrived at Harrow Crown Court today in a wheelchair with his hood up. He was jailed for two-and-a-half years for benefit fraud . But his scam unravelled when fraud investigators caught him working as a builder and driving. Kalloo, who owned four houses and had spent tens of thousands on a platnium Visa card, was sentenced at Harrow Crown Court today after being found guilty of ten counts of fraud in January. He dozed through the sentencing after taking pills for a sore leg. The court had heard that he was sacked from his job at the Willesden office of the DWP for gross misconduct in August 2010 after his crimes came to light, but the money he had received as sick pay did not form any part of the case. Fraudster: Kalloo was found guilty of ten counts of fraud at an earlier hearing . Investigators found that he had scammed £70,000 in benefits from Brent Council between 2002 and 2008 and £27,500 from Bedfordshire County Council between 2002 and 2006. Kalloo also went on to make a further £5,700 claim from Bedfordshire County Council between 2009 and 2010 and wrongly claimed a total of £106,687. Sentencing the married dad of one today, Judge John Dodd QC attacked Kalloo’s 'breathtaking dishonesty.' He added: 'It might seem to some that you chose to say that which you thought would be to your own advantage regardless of whether or not it was true. 'We have a system of benefits in this country and while it may not be perfect it is a vital part of our society and values. 'Those who abuse the benefits system in the way which you have must expect to be punished with prison. 'You have diverted resources away from those in real need of them and also arguably helped to make it more difficult for those in real need to prove their need. 'You also by your actions have served to undermine the confidence the public have in the proper and fair operation of the benefits system.' Kalloo, who owns four houses in the Luton area and travelled internationally while claiming benefits, was sentenced after he was convicted of ten counts of fraud in January. Benefit cheat: Kelvin Kalloo, of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, claimed nearly £100,000 in handouts from Brent Council and Central Bedfordshire Council over six years before being snared by the authorities' investigators . During his trial jurors heard how he had deceived authorities by claiming the money to pay for a live-in carer. He . exploited a loophole which let him arrange his own care, nominating his . wife to do the job having claimed they were no longer married but that . she was his carer. But . Kalloo was caught after being spotted behind the wheel of three . different cars and working on a Hot Caribbean food stall in Watford. Fraud investigators from Brent and . Bedfordshire councils put Kalloo under surveillance in 2009 after a . routine check on claimants revealed the ‘immobile’ fraudster claimed to . be living on the third floor of a block of flats in Kilburn with no . lift. They soon realised his actually living in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, and also saw him working as a builder renovating properties. Harrow . Crown Court also heard how Kalloo had racked up between £40,000 and . £50,000 of transactions on a platinum visa credit card over a two year . period. Today Kalloo turned up to court in a wheelchair, covered in a blanket and carrying a set of crutches. His . 'illness' meant he was unable to step into the dock, meaning two . custody officers had to sit beside him in the well of the court. Prosecutor . Clare Leslie said: 'These frauds were obtained simultaneously claiming . for large sums of money from both Brent and Bedfordshire boroughs. 'This aggravates the offence in showing a level of sophistication. 'It . necessitated the duping of a large number of people and having regard . to the nature of the fraud the defendant’s own background of having . worked for the Department of Work and Pensions it is said that the fraud . falls into a professionally-planned fraud category involving . significant planning from the outset.' A confiscation hearing has been listed for July 11.

"For little Georgia Mitchell the changing seasons heralds an exciting opportunity - the chance to play outside with her friends. The five-year-old spends the warm summer months watching from the window desperate to play in the sunshine. A rare skin condition, which leaves Georgia covered in painful scales, has held her hostage in her Kentucky home. When she was born doctors diagnosed her with the extremely rare illness non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBIE). It is excruciating and sunshine and heat exacerbates the painful symptoms. Georgia Mitchell, from Kentucky, is forced to stay indoors during the summer months. She was born with an extremely rare skin condition, which causes scales to form all over her skin. Sunshine and heat aggravates the illness, causing her excruciating pain . But with winter around the corner, the five-year-old is excited at the prospect of getting outside to play with friends. Doctors diagnosed the youngster with non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma at birth . Her mother Misty Mitchell, pictured with husband Sonny, said she knew something was wrong as soon as she had given birth after an emergency C-section . Georgia's mother, Misty Mitchell, 33, said as soon as she gave birth to her daughter, via emergency C-section, she knew something was wrong. 'When Georgia was born she had scales all over her skin - it looks like she has been burnt,' she said. 'Doctors didn't think she'd make it. 'Because of her skin she gets overheated very easily and so she cannot play outside when it is hot. 'She can't play any sports because she will get too hot too quickly. 'A lot of children don't understand why she can't join them outside. This just makes it harder for Georgia because the kids will not play with her. 'But now she is really looking forward to the winter. She cannot wait to get out in the snow and make snowmen with her friends.' Georgia, from Harlan, Kentucky was diagnosed with NBIE when she was born - a life-long condition which causes severe scaling of the skin. One of the complications of the illness, is that it prevents the normal process of sweating. It means sunlight and exercise can aggravate Georgia's skin, making her condition more painful. Mrs Mitchell, said: 'Because of her skin we have to say no to her when she asks to do certain things which is heart-breaking. 'She wants to go to Disney World but we just can't let her. There have been so many birthday parties she has asked to go to that we have to just say no because of the heat. Mrs Mitchell, said: 'Because of her skin she gets overheated very easily and so she cannot play outside when it is hot. Now she is really looking forward to the winter. She cannot wait to get out in the snow and make snowmen with her friends' The life-long condition is inherited and caused by a genetic or inherited abnormality that affects normal skin shedding. Severe scaling of the skin prevents normal sweating so hot weather or vigorous exercise causes painful repercussions for Georgia . 'But it is amazing when the winter comes each year because we can let her go outside. 'I am really looking forward to it because I love that she will be able to go outside and play.' When Mrs Mitchell went into labour and gave birth at just 32 weeks, she immediately knew something was wrong with her daughter. 'I had an emergency C-section and when I woke up when they were pushing me back to my room, I could immediately tell by my family's faces that something was wrong,' she said. 'They told me something was not right with her skin and that she was going to be transferred to a different hospital. 'But I wasn't allowed to go with her because I had just had a C-section. 'They bought her in to see me first and she was in a big bag covering her body with just her little head sticking out.' Mrs Mitchell and her husband Sonny, 38, were warned their daughter may not survive, before their newborn was transferred to the Johnson City Medical Centre. But after nine days in the hospital's neonatal unit, Mr and Mrs Mitchell were able to take their little girl home, on Christmas Eve. Mrs Mitchell said: 'I had an emergency C-section and when I woke up when they were pushing me back to my room, I could immediately tell by my family's faces that something was wrong' Doctors warned Mr and Mrs Mitchell that their daughter may not survive beyond two weeks, before transferring her to a specialist neonatal unit. After nine days in hospital, the couple were overjoyed to be able to bring Georgia home, on Christmas Eve . Due to her condition Georgia's parents were forced to withdraw her from school, after she came home each day crying in pain. Mrs Mitchell added: 'The most important lesson I have learned is to take one day at a time, have faith and enjoy the life you have been given' Non-bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma is an extremely rare skin disorder,characterised by abnormal scaling of the skin with underlying redness. It is estimated to occur in one in 300,000 births. The skin appears bright red, and has accompanying fine white or flesh coloured scales. The scales are often seen all over a sufferer's body, but the skin on the face may show milder changes. The condition is usually detected in the first few days of life, and is a life-long condition for most sufferers. It is caused by a genetic or inherited abnormality that affects normal skin shedding. One in four children will inherit two abnormal genes - one from each parent - and therefore develop the condition. Complications of the condition include: . There is currently no cure for NBIE. Treatments include preventing overheating, specific creams, drugs, as well as psychological support and counselling. Source: Ichthyosis Support Group . 'I was so worried but the doctors were fabulous and took wonderful care of Georgia,' Mrs Mitchell said. 'They were the longest nine days of my life but it was amazing when we were finally able to bring her home. 'They taught us how to live with her condition and what she could and couldn't do.' Having been warned Georgia might not survive beyond two weeks, Mrs Mitchell said her daughter has gone from strength to strength. 'They said even if she did, she wouldn't be able to crawl or walk,' she said. 'But you just have to take a look at her now to see she is doing both of these things and she is doing amazingly well.' While Georgia has proved doctors wrong, excelling in her development, the illness does hold her back from every day activities. Despite loving school, Georgia's parents had to make the difficult decision to withdraw her from classes, because it proved too much for her. 'She would come home and cry every night because her legs hurt after trying to keep up with the other children,' Mrs Mitchell said. 'It was such a shame because it was a massive milestone to reach, another one the doctors had said wouldn't happen, but she made it and she loved it.' Despite this, Mrs Mitchell is determined her daughter will excel in life. Mrs Mitchell added: 'Georgia is very outgoing and she lets nothing hold her back. 'My daughter is going to be somebody. She says she wants to be a doctor and we continue to encourage her. 'We let her know that she can do anything. 'The most important lesson I have learned is to take one day at a time, have faith and enjoy the life you have been given. 'Georgia continues to prove the doctors wrong and I am so proud of her.' Mr and Mrs Mitchell have set up a Facebook page Sweet Georgia's Journey, to raise awareness of the condition.","Georgia Mitchell was born with non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma - which causes scales all over her body .

"Daniel Schofield plied schoolgirls with alcohol before forcing himself on them . A child rapist who plied schoolgirls with alcohol before forcing himself on them has been locked up for 12 years. Daniel Schofield, 26, described as immature for his age, had invited three 14-year-olds to go to the party in Keighley, West Yorkshire, but on the way there two of the teenagers got drunk on vodka and beer. Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC said the girls were completely ill-equipped to cope with the alcohol and Schofield, who was 24 at the time, had given them drink with 'sinister intent'. He said: 'Your conversation en route was clearly sexual, and sexualised, and you made no secret, as the girls told the court, that you fancied some of them. 'You were 24. They were 14.' Bradford Crown Court heard how both girls were obviously drunk but instead of letting one of them sleep on the sofa Schofield walked her into a bedroom where he sexually abused her before leaving her curled up on the bed in a distressed state. Judge Durham Hall said Schofield, of Bradford, then took the other 14-year-old girl upstairs and bit her on the breast in what he described as 'a disturbing act'. Later that night Schofield went back into the bedroom where he had left his first victim and subjected her to more abuse including twice raping her. The judge said Schofield forced her to have full, unprotected sexual intercourse despite her verbal and physical protests. A jury found him guilty of two charges of rape, one of attempted rape, sexual activity with a child and he was also found guilty of assaulting the second girl by biting her breast. 'Your behaviour was wicked, nasty and callous,' the judge told Schofield on Wednesday who put his head in hands as he was handed his 12-year jail term. 'I gain the impression Mr Schofield that at the time you thought you could do as you pleased having made those girls insensible...and you thought that in acting in this way you could get away with it.' Judge Durham Hall highlighted the importance of the victim impact statement he had received from the rape victim following the publicity regarding Judge Graham White who had to apologise to the family of a murdered man in Merseyside after they overheard him say that victim impact statements made no difference when considering parole for his killers. Bradford Crown Court heard how Daniel Schofield, 26, plied the girls with alcohol before the attacks . Geraldine and Peter McGinty, whose son Colin was stabbed to death on Merseyside 13 years ago, say they overheard the judge commenting that the statements at such hearings did not make a difference. Praising the schoolgirl’s statement as 'a very helpful document', Judge Hall said: 'It has to be emphasised yet again how important victim impact material is, especially at the sentencing stage. 'Times have changed. Victims are at the centre of these matters. 'The damage is always incalculable. Judge Durham Hall highlighted the importance of the victim impact statement he had received . 'She may never recover from that ordeal. 'There has been an attack her on an extremely vulnerable child. 'There was a degree of planning and intention. Drugs were used in the sense of alcohol to facilitate the offence. You had taken those girls there. They had, as it were, entrusted their safety to you.' The judge accepted that Schofield was somewhat immature but he said he was not a youth and knew what he was doing. As part of the sentence Judge Durham Hall imposed an indefinite sexual offences prevention order on Schofield which bans him from having any contact with the complainants and he must also register as a sex offender with the police for the rest of his life. The judge said Schofield would serve half of the 12-year sentence but added he would then be subject to a rigorous licence supervision and conditions. After the case, Detective Constable Rebecca Botwright, of the Bradford District Safeguarding Unit, said: 'Schofield knew his victims were not of consenting age, yet forced himself upon them after plying them with alcohol. 'This must have been very distressing for them and we would like to thank them for their courage in coming forward. 'We hope the sentence which has been passed down today will help to give them some closure. 'We also hope that it will encourage victims of sexual offences to come forward and report them to our specially trained officers, who will investigate every complaint, no matter how historic, with the aim of securing a conviction.'","Daniel Schofield, 26, was described as immature for his age .

"A pedestrian who was hit by a cyclist died from a massive blood clot six days after doctors failed to spot a badly injured artery in his neck, an inquest has heard. David Purkis, 58, from West Wickham, was walking along Regent Street in London when he was hit by a cyclist on July 25 last year. Both the married father-of-two and the cyclist appeared unharmed at the time and spoke together before parting ways. Mr Purkis was taken to Princess Royal University Hospital in Bromley three days after he was hit in London . Mr Purkis was taken by ambulance to Princess Royal University Hospital in Kent three days later with blurred vision, dizziness and a headache and given a CT scan. Dr Sale Ogbobi, a consultant radiologist, who is being represented during the inquest along with Kings College Hospital where the Mr Purkis died, was responsible for reporting on the scan's results. He told the court: 'I was looking out for previous injury and with his history of the accident three days before, I was looking for what you would expect from a head injury. 'He had slurred speech and dizziness so the most likely cause was a head injury, that was what I was treating this as.' Expert witness, neurosurgeon Dr Peter Ward, told Southwark Coroner's Court earlier that a 'trained radiologist' should have noticed in the CT scan that Mr Purkis had suffered from a dissected artery in his neck which was causing blood clots to the brain. Dr Ogbobi, who was looking at the scan from his computer at home, said the software did not have a 'stroke setting' at the time, which contributed to him not diagnosing the problem. Bike accident: David Purkis, 58, was walking down Regent Street in London when he was hit . 'After reviewing the images later, I saw what I could have done to deduce this and ordered a stroke setting to be put on my computer,' he said. A consultant in the A&E department, Dr Andrew Hobart, said Mr Purkis had not shown 'clinical signs of a stroke' when he arrived at hospital on July 28 last year three days after the collision. 'It was noted his blurred vision had started that day at lunch time and that he had had been in a bike collision,' he said. 'However, he did not have symptoms of the accident and his CT scan was reported as normal.' Mr Purkis was discharged in the early hours of July 29 but was rushed back by ambulance that afternoon with paramedics suspecting a stroke. 'I do not think the incident with the collision led to the underlying causes of Mr Purkis' death' Dr Andrew Hobart, A&E department . 'He was seen immediately by the stroke team and sent for another CT scan,' he said. 'Contrary to the radiologist report, there were signs of a stroke and the second scan showed a dissection of his artery at the base of his neck, causing a blockage.' Mr Purkis was taken to Kings College Hospital hours later where he went through a decompression surgery the next day to reduce swelling of his brain. 'However, his consciousness level decreased and on August 3, he died as a result of the major stroke,' he said. 'The CT scan would have shown possibilities of a stroke and had it given that information, Mr Purkis would have been referred to the stroke team immediately.' Although Dr Hobart said the dissection of the artery could happen 'any time' after an accident, the longer the delay 'the less likely the accident caused the dissection'. 'The collision with the bicycle may have caused the dissection but it might not have caused it at all. 'I do not think the incident with the collision led to the underlying causes of Mr Purkis' death.' Earlier Dr Ward said the dissection could have been caused by the patient's hypertension and high cholesterol, two long term factors which can lead to the condition. The inquest continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","David Purkis, 58, was hit by the cyclist in Regent Street, London on July 25 .

"An exhumed 2,500 year old mummified Siberian princess is set to be reburied because native groups in the Altai Mountains claim her posthumous anger is causing floods and earthquakes. The tattooed corpse of the 25-year-old woman was preserved in permafrost until she was dug up more than two decades ago. It was this act, it is claimed, that has caused her anger. Now the Council of Elders in Altai - representing native Siberians in the region - have passed a vote to rebury her remains, a decision apparently accepted by local governor Alexander Berdnikov. The exhumed 2,500 mummified Siberian princess are set to be reburied because of claims her posthumous anger is causing floods and earthquakes . A specialist looks over the preserved remains of the Princess Ukok in her display case . A sculptor's impression of what Princess Ukok would have originally looked like . Campaigners claimed that recent flooding in Altai - the worst in 50 years - and a series of earthquakes are the result of ancient anger at the grave being disturbed, The Siberian Times reported. A ban has been imposed on further archeological digs in other burial mounds in the remote area where her remains were found. Known as 'Princess Ukok' after the plateau where her burial chamber was found by Russian scientists, the discovery of her grave led to a leap in understanding of the Pazyryk people who lived before Christ in this remote mountainous region. The mummy was excavated by Novosibirsk expert Natalia Polosmak in 1993 and was seen as 'one of the most significant archeological discoveries at the close of the 20th century'. A close-up image of tattoos on the shoulder of Princess Ukok; the image shows a deer with a griffon's beak and a Capricorn's antlers . Buried around the body were six horses, saddled and bridled, her spiritual escorts to the next world, and a symbol of her evident status, possibly as a revered folk tale narrator, a healer or a holy woman. In the elaborate grave was a meal of sheep and horse meat and ornaments made from felt, wood, bronze and gold. Some accounts, also suggest she was found with a small container of cannabis, along with a stone plate on which were the burned seeds of coriander. The princess had a tattoo of a mythological animal on her left shoulder, and another creature was depicted on her wrist . The Siberian princess was also adorned with several elaborate tattoos. Tattoos on her left shoulder show a fantastical . mythological animal: a deer with a griffon's beak and a Capricorn's . antlers which are decorated with the heads of griffons. The . same griffon's head is shown on the back of the animal. The mouth of a spotted panther with a long tail is seen with the legs of a sheep. She also has a deer's head on her wrist, with big antlers. There is a drawing on the animal's body on a thumb on her left hand. Dr Polosmak said: 'Compared to all tattoos found by archeologists around the world, those on the mummies of the Pazyryk people are the most complicated, and the most beautiful. 'More ancient tattoos have been found, like the Ice Man found in the Alps - but he only had lines, not the perfect and highly artistic images one can see on the bodies of the Pazyryks. 'It is a phenomenal level of tattoo art. Incredible.' The native people in Altai, though not genetically related to the ice princess, objected to her removal from her tomb which sat at an altitude of 8,200 feet in the Altai Mountains. They were also against plans to display her in a specially built glass sarcophagus in a museum in regional capital Gorno-Altaisk. But local peoples from the Altai Republic, which borders Kazakhstan and Mongolia, say the presence of the mummy - also known as Ooch-Bala - in the burial chamber was 'to bar the entrance to the kingdom of the dead'. Princess Ukok's remains were found in the Ukok plateau in the Altai mountains in Siberia . The traditional clothes worn by men and women during the period Princess Ukok was alive . By removing the permafrost corpse the elders contend that 'the entrance remains open'. Campaigners in support of burial complained that 'naked and defenseless, Ooch-Bala is freezing from inexplicable shame'. A statement stressed: 'Who puts the naked corpse of their mother on public display? She knocks into our heart, seeking compassion. She is cold from evil indifference.' Spokeswoman for the regional government Oksana Yeremeeva said: 'The decision of Council of Elders is very respectable, but we cannot implement it immediately.' Currently the mummy was seen as a museum possession and a new law would be needed to give the go-ahead to a reburial. She said: 'The mummy, though it can sound quite rude, is still a museum exhibit, that is we cannot just bury it, no-one has done such things before.' The move is likely to require validation by the Russian Ministry of Culture in Moscow. The scientists who found Princess Ukok also discovered that she had a shaved head and wore a big, along with an elaborate headdress. Buried with her was a face brush made from horse hair, and a fragment of an 'eyeliner pencil'.","It is claimed Princess Ukok is angry about having her grave disturbed .

"North Korea is to publish its own report saying its human rights record is 'bright and rosy' - six months after the UN condemned the regime accusing the secretive state of committing crimes against humanity. The North's Association for Human Rights Studies said the report would counter the 'lies and fabrications' made by unspecified 'hostile forces' about the rights situation in the isolated state. North Korea is regularly listed among the world's worst human rights offenders in indexes compiled by governments, UN agencies and rights watchdogs. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks to officials at a machine plant in Pyongyang. North Korea is to publish its own report saying its human rights record is 'bright and rosy' In one of the most comprehensive reports to date, a UN inquiry into the North's rights record published its findings in February and detailed a wide range of systemic abuses including murder, enslavement and torture. The commission concluded that many of the violations constituted crimes against humanity and suggested they could be placed before the International Criminal Court. The report likened North Korea's regime to Nazism and called for the International Criminal Court to close political prison camps. The use of systematic torture, starvation, and killings is akin to punishments ordered under Adolf Hitler, the report stated. 'The gravity, scale and nature of these violations revealed a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world,' it said. However, North Korea rejected the report as a 'sheer fabrication' invented by the United States and its allies. Kim Jong-Un's North Korea is to publish report saying its human rights record for the future is looking good . The UN commission concluded that many of the violations constituted crimes against humanity . The country is estimated to have 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners in its sprawling gulag system . A spokesman from the North's rights association said its own report would help people 'do away with their prejudice and misunderstanding' about the rights situation in the country. 'The report will show the true picture of the people of the (North) dynamically advancing towards a brighter and rosy future,' he said in an interview with the North's official KCNA news agency. No release date was given but the spokesman said the report would be published in 'the near future'. The impoverished but nuclear-armed North has been ruled for more than six decades by the Kim family dynasty that has maintained power with an iron fist and zero tolerance for political dissent. The country is estimated to have 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners in its sprawling gulag system. Those who are caught crossing the border to China in a bid to flee poverty and repression at home are often sent to jail or executed. In February, the UN's commission of inquiry into human rights in North Korea published a damning report detailing human rights abuses committed by the country's leadership against its own people. They compared the scale of the abuse to the atrocities committed by the Nazis. Michael Kirby, the chair of the report, personally wrote to Kim Jong-un to warn him that he could face trial at The Hague for his personal culpability in crimes against humanity. Brutal: Life in the totalitarian North Korean camps shown by a former guard who took this photo . The UN's Commission on human rights in North Korea gathered evidence for more almost a year. It said there was compelling evidence of torture, execution and arbitary imprisonment, deliberate starvation and a lack of free thought. Michael Kirby, an Australian retired judge, who was chairman of the panel, said: 'The commission wishes to draw your attention that it will therefore recommend that the United Nations refer the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [the formal name for North Korea] to the international criminal court to render accountable all those, including possibly yourself, who may be responsible for the crimes against humanity.' At the time of the report was published, Mr Kirby said there were 'many parallels' between the evidence he heard and crimes committed by the Nazis during the Second World War. This complex known as known as Hwasong camp covers 200 square miles and is home to 20,000 prisoners . In one case a prison camp inmate had been given the task of burning the bodies of those who had starved to death before the remains were used as fertiliser. Mr Kirby said: 'Now the international community does know. There will be no excusing a failure of action because we didn't know. It's too long now. The suffering and the tears of the people of North Korea demand action.' The report was 400-pages long and concluded there was overwhelming evidence that crimes against humanity have been and are still being committed. The inquiry also found 'an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion'. It reported on the vast network of secret prison camps known as kwanliso where hundreds of thousands of North Koreans are believed to have died. It is estimated that between 80,000 and 120,000 political prisoners are still held and their cases are often kept secret. The report says: 'Their families are not informed of their fate or whereabouts. Persons accused of political crimes therefore become victims of enforced disappearance. 'Making the suspect disappear is a deliberate feature of the system that serves to instil fear in the population.' If a woman becomes pregnant by a Chinese man, newborn babies are often drowned or the mother is forced to have an abortion. The report also said the state often uses food as a means of control over the population. 'It has prioritised those whom the authorities believe to be crucial in maintaining the regime over those deemed expendable', the report said.","North Korea said its report would counter 'lies and fabrications'

"He has been looking for love online since splitting from Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid. And it appears Dominic Cotton’s search may have come to an end. The 46-year-old was spotted outside his home with mother-of-two Adela Straughan, just days after Miss Reid left the house to go on holiday. Scroll down for video . Romance: Susanna Reid's ex-husband Dominic Cotton was seen with new girlfriend Adela Straughan this week . Miss Straughan, 43, joined Mr Cotton on Saturday, and they were also seen together later in the week. Miss Straughan, who is in the process of divorcing her husband, and Mr Cotton appeared to be going on an afternoon jaunt as they loaded up his car with padded jackets and bags last Sunday. An onlooker saw them kiss before heading off to their destination. Yesterday Mr Cotton said Miss Reid, 43, was aware that he was in a new relationship – admitting it was ‘odd’ because they still live under the same roof in South London. The pair, who have three sons, were together for 15 years before parting earlier this year in February in what was dubbed the ‘curse of Strictly’ as it came just after her appearance on the BBC show which has seen numerous couples split. He said: ‘Susanna knows I’ve got a girlfriend. This is an odd situation living together, but we get on really well.’ The pair, who have three sons, were together for 15 years before parting in February. Growing apart: Mr Cotton and Miss Reid, who were together for 15 years, pictured with each other in December . Mr Cotton then set up a profile on dating website Match.com in which he said he was looking for a woman aged 35 to 45 and added: ‘Underneath my blokeish exterior I am a sensitive soul. ‘I enjoy sharing things and am someone who doesn’t shy away from commitment. Life is for living with someone special.’ Things aren’t so bright for Miss Reid this week.

"Shocking: Matthew Warren, 27, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 5 . Pastor Rick Warren gave his first sermon since his son killed himself in April. Matthew Warren, 27 shot himself after struggling with mental illness. The pastor and his wife Kay returned to their 20,000 strong congregation at Saddleback Church, California, on Saturday. Thousands showed up for the sermon, with two overflow tents being filled, reported Time. The crowd stood and applauded the couple as they walked hand in hand onstage. Pastor Warren kissed his crying wife as he too became teary, before telling the congregation that he loved them. He said: ‘For 27 years, I prayed every day of my life for God to heal my son’s mental illness. It was the number one prayer of my life. It just didn’t make sense why this prayer was not being answered.’ For the first time the couple described how they discovered their son was dead. On April 5 Pastor and Warren was diagnosed with double pneumonia and asked his brother to give his sermon entitled ‘What to do on the worst day of your life.’ The couple said that neither of them could shake the feeling that something was wrong with their son so they went to his house. Upon arrival they could see that his truck was there, but there was no answer. When the police arrived their fears were confirmed. The pastor said that he and his wife had drawn on old Bible passages from the prophet Isaiah for strength. Support: This was the first time Pastor Warren and his wife Kay had been onstage at their church since April . He added that his friends and family had supported him: ‘I am in this family of spiritual redwoods. Satan picked the wrong team to pick on.’ Pastor Warren said that his parish will now campaign to remove the stigma of mental illness in the church. He said: ‘Your illness is not your identity, your chemistry is not your character. We are here for you, and we are in this together.’ He has written a sermon series named ‘How to get through what you’re going through’, and will deliver it over the next six weeks. Each week focusses on a different stage of grief: shock, sorrow, struggle, surrender, sanctification and service. It was revealed shortly after his death that Matthew Warren killed himself with an unregistered gun purchased over the internet. Tragedy: The youngest son of Rick Warren, the evangelical pastor pictured delivering the invocation at Obama's 2009 inauguration, has committed suicide at the age of 27 . Pastor Warren said he forgives whoever sold the weapon. Orange County Sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said that the gun's serial number was scratched off. It's illegal in California to buy a gun without a background check and purchasers are supposed to register their firearms. Defacing a gun's serial number is a federal offense. ‘Someone on the internet sold Matthew an unregistered gun. I pray he seeks God's forgiveness. I forgive him. #MATTHEW 6:15,' the pastor tweeted, referencing a Biblical passage about the forgiveness of sins. ‘If you forgive men when they sin against you, your Heavenly Father will forgive you. But if you don't...,’ Warren then tweeted, quoting the verse. The Christian community was shaken after Matthew died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 5 in Mission Viejo, Calif., after a long battle with mental illness. Politics: Rick Warren hosted the Civil Forum on The Presidency, attended by both Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and then Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) at Saddleback Church in August 2008 during the 2008 presidential election . Christian right: President George W. Bush, with his wife Laura in 2008, receives the International Medal of PEACE from Warren at the Saddleback Civil Forum on Global Health at the Newseum in Washington, DC . Rick Warren's revelation about the weapon comes as Congress debates controversial gun-control legislation, including expanded background checks on gun sales. After the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December, he spoke to Fox News about his views on what he called America's 'culture of violence.' ‘There's a mental health angle that you have to deal with; I don't think we're taking care of those struggling with mental illness like we need to in America,’ he said. The news came as a shock to the Evangelical community, where Rick and his wife, Kay, are major celebrities after the release of the Purpose Driven Life in 2002. Congregation: Kay and Rick Warren founded the church in 1980 and it has grown into a megachurch, with an average weekly attendance of 20,000 . The devotional book became a New York Times bestseller and has sold over 32 million copies worldwide. The Warrens also have two older children, Amy and Josh. Though the couple has been vocal about their marital struggles and Kay Warren has written about being a victim of sexual-abuse as a child, the couple had not disclosed their son's condition. The family has established a fund in Matthew's memory and are raising money to help others impacted by mental illness. Rick Warren started his church in 1980 and it has grown to become one of the largest evangelical churches in the U.S. with an average attendance of 20,000.","Pastor Rick Warren gave his first sermon since his son killed himself .

"A leading academic has warned that university students could be at risk from the deadly ebola virus – because 21,000 students from countries in the affected region are about to arrive in the UK. Anthony Glees, the Professor of Politics at Buckingham University, called for West African students to be held in their home countries until they have been declared clear of ebola and the 21-day incubation period has passed. His comments came as Sierra Leone announced that it was introducing a four-day ‘lockdown’ to try to prevent the out-of-control epidemic from spreading further. People in the west African country will not be allowed to leave their homes from September 18 to 21. Scroll down for video . High level isolation apparatus in the High Secure Infectious Disease Unit at The Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead . The disease spreads through contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or contaminated environments and has killed more than 2,100 in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria in recent months. Symptoms include fever, bleeding and damage to the central nervous system, and the current outbreak has a mortality rate of 55 per cent. Professor Glees accused the Government and universities of ‘extreme complacency’ over the issue. ‘This plague is on the rampage,’ he said. ‘What no one seems to realise is that we are potentially at grave risk from any one of the 21,000 students from West African states who are going to arrive in the UK over the next fortnight. Ebola under the microscope - students from affected countries could develop symptoms up to three weeks after arrival . ‘Students from affected countries could develop symptoms up to three weeks after arrival. Even where they have been screened before departing they may be sick. We should consider preventing them coming to the UK for 21 days so we can be sure they are not sick.’ He suggested that ‘cash-strapped’ universities regarding overseas students as ‘a vital source of income’ were turning a blind eye to the risk. Last month Universities UK, the membership organisation for the country’s 136 universities, passed on to universities the government’s official advice saying that the Ebola risk to the UK remains ‘very low’. Aerial view of an area of Freetown, Sierra Leone . If a suspected case emerged, the patient should be immediately isolated – and looked after by staff equipped with ‘surgical gloves, plastic aprons, plastic visors and surgical facemasks’. But Professor Glees said: ‘No university has this kind of kit to hand unless they have medical schools. Many universities are in smaller towns and do not have the facilities of larger cities such as London. Students are not only obliged to share toilet and shower facilities, but exchanging bodily fluids is something they do with great frequency. ‘I am appalled by the total lack of practical advice, training or equipment for those working in universities who may come into contact with infected students.’ However, last night Dr Ben Neuman, a virology expert at Reading University who teaches students from West Africa, said: ‘The screening system at airports means that the numbers of infected patients potentially reaching the UK is tiny. Universities who think they have a case on their hands would refer it immediately to hospital.’","Students in Britain could be at risk from influx from Africa .

"The perfect cup of coffee is an elusive dream for many. Every morning, millions wait in line for an overpriced brew, only to find it’s too cold, too sweet or too weak. But one U.S. technology firm is on a mission to change that. Briggo has recently unveiled its Coffee Haus at the University of Texas in Austin- a robotic kiosk that allows you to order you perfect cup of coffee from your mobile. The Coffee Haus feature real-time order status and a peek at Briggo's patented robotics, which are precisely calibrated to deliver a full menu of specialty coffees . The Coffee Haus combines smartphone control and precision robotic technology with artisan coffee in what they claim will ‘revolutionise the coffee experience’. The kiosk features real-time order status. Customers tune and pre-order personalised drinks via their mobiles or tablets.

"At nearly a stone, she is twice the weight of the average newborn girl. But even more remarkable is that Jasleen’s mother managed to deliver her naturally, without the need for a Caesarean section. She was born on Friday in Leipzig, Germany, weighing 13lb 8oz (6.11kg) and measuring 23in (57.5 cm) long. Germany's heaviest newborn: Jasleen weighed in at 13lb 8oz when she was born in Leipzig last month . The mother, who gave birth at University Hospital in Leipzig, discovered she had a previously undiagnosed case of gestational diabetes which can lead to a larger than usual birth weight . Her mother Maria, 31, who turned up at the hospital on the day of the birth, said: ‘I was somewhat shocked at her size. ‘My 11-year-old daughter was a third of her weight, my two-year-old son a little under that. 'My stomach was a lot bigger this time around but I had no idea there was such a giant inside.’ Doctors discovered that the mother was suffering from undiagnosed gestational diabetes which can cause abnormally big babies. Jasleen was born in Leipzig (pictured), and is now officially the largest new-born in Germany . Jasleen was born at University Hospital Leipzig (pictured) on July 26 . Jasleen is Germany’s heaviest, . beating a 13lb boy called Jihad born in November 2011, but is 10lb . lighter than the world record. She is doing well but remains in neonatal intensive care at Leipzig University Hospital while doctors monitor her. 1. The biggest baby ever recorded was born in Canada to mother Anna Bates in 1879. Mrs Bates and her husband martin were 7’5” and 7’11” respectively. They had a baby boy that weighed 23lb. 12 oz, but sadly he died 11 hours later. 2. In 2005 a Brazilian woman gave birth to a 17lb baby boy named Admilton does Santos. He was mother Francisca’s fifth child and it is thought that his size was also caused by diabetes. Admilton was given glucose at birth due to his mother’s condition.Her four other children were all born at normal weights. 3. In March of this year a British couple welcomed the second largest baby ever to be born in the UK. Little George King weighed 12lb and 7oz, more than double the average for a newborn, at Gloucester Royal Infirmary. He arrived two weeks late and was born naturally, but no-one had expected Jade to have a baby so large. She said: ‘He was a surprise — a big surprise, as it turned out.’ 4. A Texan family welcomed 16lb 1oz  JaMichael Brown in 2011, who is believed to have been the largest born in the state. He was 24 inches long, his head measured 15 inches and his chest, 17 inches. Mother Janet said: ‘I can’t believe he’s that big. A lot of the baby clothes we bought for him will have to be returned. They’re already too small for him to wear.' Not-so-little JaMichael also came out with a full head of hair and the hospital did not have diapers big enough to fit him. Father, Michael Brown said he had high hopes his son would become a footballer. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that affects women during pregnancy. Up to five per cent of women giving birth in England and Wales has diabetes. Most of these women have gestational diabetes, but some have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In most cases, gestational diabetes develops in the third trimester - after 28 weeks - and usually disappears after the baby is born. Diabetes is a condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the amount of glucose in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin. But during pregnancy, some women have higher than normal levels of glucose in their blood and their body cannot produce enough insulin to transport it all into the cells. This means that the level of glucose in the blood rises. Gestational diabetes can be controlled with diet and exercise but some women will need medication to control blood glucose levels. If gestational diabetes is not detected and controlled, it can increase the risk of birth complications, such as babies being large for their gestational age known as macrosomia. Macrosomia is a term used to describe babies when they are born weighting more than 8.8lb.It occurs because the excess glucose in the mother’s blood is passed to the unborn baby. This causes the foetus to produce the growth hormone insulin that allows glucose to enter the cells, which results in growth. Macrosomia can lead to a condition called shoulder dystocia. This is when the baby’s head passes through the vagina, but your baby’s shoulder gets stuck in the mother's pelvis  during birth. This can be dangerous as a baby may not be able to breathe while they are stuck. It is estimated to affect 1 in 200 births. Other complications relating to gestation diabetes include risk of premature birth, neonatal hypoglycaemia – when a newborn has low blood glucose, which can cause poor feeding, blue-tinged skin and irritability - and perinatal death, the death of the baby shortly after birth.","Jasleen born on Friday - weighing 13lb 8oz and measuring 23in long .

"Egyptian authorities have detained a bird that a citizen suspected of being a spy. Officials say a man took the bird to a police station in the Qena governorate, some 280 miles southeast of Cairo, on Friday. He suspected the bird was an undercover agent because it carried an electronic device. A migrating stork is held in a police station after a citizen suspected it of being a spy and brought it to the authorities . The head of security in Qena confirmed that officials examined the bird and the device. Mohammed Kamal said the device was neither an explosive nor a spying device. It is thought to have probably been a wildlife tracker. Earlier this year, a security guard filed a police report after capturing a pigeon he said carried microfilm. Officials say the man suspected the bird was an undercover agent because it carried an electronic device . With turmoil gripping Egypt, authorities and citizens remain suspicious of anything foreign. The country has been in turmoil following the July 3 coup that toppled President Mohammad Morsi. Clashes between Egyptian security forces and Morsi's supporters have killed hundreds of people. 'We do believe that the recent operations of the security forces have been disproportionate and we're worried about the resulting alarming number of people that have been killed,' said the EU's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. Clashes between supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and Egypt's ousted president Mohamed Morsi continue . Political turbulence has kept Egypt on edge for months. At least 900 people, including 100 soldiers and police, have been killed in a crackdown on Morsi supporters, making it the country's bloodiest internal episode in decades. The United States and the European Union have both been reviewing aid to Cairo in light of the bloodshed, but Saudi Arabia, a foe of the Brotherhood, has promised to make up any shortfall.","Concerned man took the bird to a police station in the Qena governorate .

"Children often learn to count to ten using their fingers or toes, but that wouldn't help one four-year-old boy in India who has 25 digits. Arpan Saxena from Bhopal, India, suffers from two rare genetic disorders called Polydactyl, a disorder that gives rise to excess digits being formed, and Syndactyly, which leads to fingers and toes being fused together. Arpan, who has 13 fingers and 12 toes, enjoys celebrity status in Bhopal, with his picture plastered on city walls. Unlucky for some: Arpan Saxena shows his 13 fingers at his home in Bhopal, India.  He said he liked being a local celebrity . Arpan says he wishes he could wear normal shoes . 'I love it when people come to see me and take photos,' he said. 'But the only thing I don't like is that I can't walk a lot because my feet never fit in any shoes.' His father, Anil Saxena, 35, a rickshaw puller, confirmed the toddler was originally born with 26 digits. 'When he was born, we were surprised to see that he had 26 fingers and toes,' he said. 'I had never ever heard of anyone being born with so many fingers.' Following an accident, Arpan lost a finger when he was just two years old. 'He was out playing when he injured one of his fingers and it just sort of came off,' Anil said. Arpan Saxena with his mother Taruna and doing some school work (right).

'Arpan is famous all over Bhopal and we like it that way, and I am apprehensive about how an operation might affect him at this age.' His father survived the Bhopal disaster - a huge industrial accident at a pesticide plant in 1984. Campaigners say at least 15,000 were killed within days and that the effects of the gas continue to this day. They also say Bhopal has an unusually high incidence of children with birth defects, as well as cancers and other chronic illnesses. Arpan does not hold a world record for most number of fingers and toes.

"The intricate patterns of 2,500-year-old tattoos - some from the body of a Siberian 'princess' preserved in the permafrost - have been revealed in Russia. The remarkable body art includes mythological creatures and experts say the elaborate drawings were a sign of age and status for the ancient nomadic Pazyryk people, described in the 5th century BC by the Greek historian Herodotus. But scientist Natalia Polosmak - who discovered the remains of ice-clad 'Princess Ukok' high in the Altai Mountains - is also struck about how little has changed in more than two millennia. The Body of Princess Ukok, who died aged 25, had several tattoos on her body, including a deer with a griffon's beak and a Capricorn's antlers. The tattoos have been perfectly preserved for 2,500 years. 'I think we have not moved far from Pazyryks in how the tattoos are made,'  she told the Siberian Times ( SiberianTimes.com ). Princess Ukok, who died aged 25, was believed to be either a royal, a revered folk tale narrator, a healer or a holy woman. She was surrounded by two male warriors to protect her, and six horses to ease their journey into the next life. 'It is still about a craving to make yourself as beautiful as possible.' 'For example, about the British. 'A lot of them go on holiday to Greece, and when I've been there I heard how Greeks were smiling and saying that a British man's age can be easily understood by the number of tattoos on his body. 'I'm talking the working class now. 'And I noticed it, too. 'The older a person, the more tattoos are on his body.' Dr Polosmak added: 'We can say that . most likely there was  - and is - one place on the body for everyone to . start putting the tattoos on, and it was a left shoulder. 'I can assume so because all the mummies we found with just one tattoo had it on their left shoulders. Researchers also found two warriors close to the Princess , and were able to reconstruct their tattoos. Here, one is shown with an animal covering the right side of his body, across his right shoulder and stretching from his chest to his back. 'And nowadays this is the same place where people try to put the tattoos on, thousands of years on. 'I think its linked to the body composition - as the left shoulder is the place where it is noticeable most, where it looks the most beautiful. 'Nothing changes with years, the body stays the same, and the person making a tattoo now is getting closer to his ancestors than he or she may realise.' The tattoo patterns are from the ancient 'princess' who died at around the age of 25 - and from two warriors found on an ancient permafrost burial site at Ukok Plateau some 2,500 metres above sea level close to Russia's frontiers with modern day  Mongolia, China and Kazakhstan. Princess Ukok's hand with marked tattoos on her fingers. She was dug out of the ice 19 years ago, and is set to go on public display in the Altai Republic. The reconstruction of the tattoos in the images shown here were released to coincide with the moving of the remains of the princess, dug out of the ice 19 year ago, to a permanent glass sarcophagus in the National Museum in Gorno-Altaisk, capital of the Altai Republic. Eventually she will be displayed to tourists. Buried around her were six horses, saddled and bridled, her spiritual escorts to the next world, and a symbol of her evident status, though experts are divided on whether she was a royal or a revered folk tale narrator, a healer or a holy woman. Next to hear body was a meal of sheep and horse meat and ornaments made from felt, wood, bronze and gold.  And a small container of cannabis, say some accounts, along with a stone plate on which were the burned seeds of coriander. 'Tattoos were used as a mean of personal identification - like a passport now, if you like,' said Dr Polosmak. The tattoos of one of two warriors found on the ancient permafrost burial site at Ukok Plateau some 2,500 metres above sea level close to Russia's frontiers with modern day  Mongolia, China and Kazakhstan . Tattoos are clearly visible on one of the warrior's shoulders. The designs are similar to those found on the Princess. 'The Pazyryks also believed the tattoos would be helpful in another life, making it easy for the people of the same family and culture to find each other after death. 'Pazyryks repeated the same images of animals in other types of art, which is considered to be like a language of animal images, which represented their thoughts.'The tattoos were 'used to express some thoughts and to define one's position both in society, and in the world. The more tattoos were on the body, the longer it meant the person lived, and the higher was his position. 'For example the body of one man, which was found earlier in the 20th century, had his entire body covered with tattoos, as you see on the picture of his torso,' said Dr Polosmak. 'Our young woman - the princess - has only her two  arms tattooed. So they signified both age and status.' The Ukok plateau, Altai, Siberi, where Princess Ukok and two warriors were discovered. Their bodies were surrounded by six horses fully bridles, various offering of food and a pouch of cannabis. Princess Ukok: sculptor's impression of what she looked like 2,500 years ago . The Siberian Times said: ""The tattoos on the left shoulder of the 'princess'  show a mythological animal - a deer with a griffon's beak and a Capricorn's antlers. 'The antlers are decorated with the heads of griffons. 'And the same griffon's head is shown on the back of the animal. The mouth of a spotted panther with a long tail is seen at the legs of a sheep. 'She also has a dear's head on her wrist, with big antlers. 'There is a drawing on the animal's body on a thumb on her left hand. 'On the man found close to the 'princess', the tattoos include the same fantastical creature, this time covering the right side of his body, across his right shoulder and stretching from his chest to his back. 'The patterns mirror the tattoos on a much more elaborately covered male body dug from the ice in 1929 whose highly decorated torso in reconstructed in our drawing here. 'His chest, arms, part of the back and the lower leg are covered with tattoos. There is an argali - a mountain sheep - along with the same dear with griffon's vulture-like beak, with horns and the back of its head which has griffon's head and an onager drawn on it.'","Incredibly well preserved body found high in the Altai mountains, with two warriors buried close by for protections and six horses to ease the journey into the next life .

"The mysterious 'Shirtless FBI Agent' who began the investigation that led to the resignation of David Petraeus has been revealed. Frederick W. Humphries, has been accused of sending Tampa socialite Jill Kelley sexual photos of himself after she contacted him for help about threatening emails she had received from David Petraeus' biographer-turned-mistress Paula Broadwell. But today the 47-year-old insisted the photograph was sent as a 'joke' and described it as him 'posing with a couple of dummies.' Scroll Down For Video . FBI Special Agent Fred Humphries has been identified as the 'Shirtless FBI Agent' who helped begin the investigation that brought down David Petraeus . Veteran FBI agent Frederick Humphries is recognised as a dilligent and passionate officer who helped to thwart numerous terror threats to the United States . Refuting media suggestions that the . picture was sent because he had become enamoured with the attractive . Florida socialite, the decorated FBI agent said that the photo was sent . years ago. According to . the general counsel for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers . Association who have spoken to Humphries, the FBI counter terrorism . agent only passed on the information Kelley provided him with and played . no part in the subsequent investigation. Lawrence Berger told the New York Times that Humphries, who played a key role in stopping a terrorist attack aimed at blowing up Los . Angeles International Airport  in 1999 and his wife had been 'social friends with Ms. Kelley and her husband prior to the day she referred the matter to him.' 'They always socialized and corresponded.' Berger . denied any suggestion that Humphries sent inappropriate shirtless . pictures to Kelley during the course of the investigation which has now . engulfed the intelligence community in Washington. Emails to a friend: Socialite Jill Kelly arrives home in Tampa on Tuesday night . 'That picture was sent years before . Kelley contacted him about this, and it was sent as part of a larger . context of what I would call social relations in which the families . would exchange numerous photos of each other,' said Berger. Claiming that the picture was sent as . a 'joke', Berger said that Humphries was 'posing with a couple of . dummies' at the time of the photograph and that it was not sexual in . nature. However, those with knowledge of the . investigation that Humphries sparked said that he was given a . dressing down by his superiors for trying to push the complaint forward. In fact, according to the New York . Times, Humphries believed that the case was purposefully being . stalled for political reasons. So much so, that in October, Humphries contacted Representative Dave Recihert, a Republican from . Washington State, where Humphries had worked before to ask for his help - purposefully going over his bosses heads. Serious: Humphries is pictured at a news conference in July 2005 at the Federal Courthouse in Seattle . 'Sense of humour': Humphries claims that the topless picture he sent to Kelley was 'a joke' Mr. Reichert directed him to House . majority leader, Eric Cantor who eventually passed the message onto the . FBI director, Robert S. Mueller. According to Wired Magazine, . Cantor and his staff personally met with Humphries in October but were . unable to act on the information he was giving them because they doubted . his credibility. They . also had no idea that FBI were investigating David Petraeus in the first . place and after conferring they decided to contact FBI Director Robert . Mueller on October 31st. One . week later, on November 6th, Election Day, Mueller went to James . Clapper the director of national intelligence and Petraeus' immediate . superior - who urged him to resign his position as head of the CIA. In . fact, the House Judiciary Committee has written to Mueller to ask why . it took him a week to come forward with the information that Humphries . had given him. In the field: In this April 12, 2007, photo, Frederick Humphries, right, works a scene in Tampa, Florida . This photo taken Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2012 shows the home owned by FBI agent Frederick Humphries in Dover, Florida . This information puts severe doubt . over Humphries assertion that he took no active interest in the case . that has caused the resignation of the CIA chief David Petraeus and . could cause the downfall of General John Allen, who commands U.S. troops . in Afghanistan. 'Fred is a passionate kind of guy,' said one former colleague. 'He’s kind of an obsessive type. If he locked . his teeth onto something, he’d be a bulldog.' Humphries has since been reassigned and his status is being reviewed by the FBI. Jon Adler, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, . defended Humphries as a experienced professional. 'From my view issues . of national security have unfortunately been reduced to a bad episode of . 'Real Housewives,' he said to the Wall Street Journal. 'The photos should not undermine the fact . that the agent responded in a timely way and appropriately, nor do they . reflect any amorous relationship,' he said.

However, after his April 2009 acquital, Megahed was arrested again for a deportation hearing - after authorities deemed his continuation in the United States too dangerous to continue. 'We felt that Mr. Megahed was willingly providing assistance to Mr. Mohamed, who is a self-professed terrorist,' Humphries said at the time to The Tampa Bay Times.

Association, told New York Magazine that Humphries passed the . information on to supervisors but was not assigned to the case. 'No one tries to become a whistle-blower,' said Lawrence Berger. 'Consistent with FBI policy, he referred it to the proper component.' This comes as it was revealed that the harassing emails sent by Paula Broadwell, the biographer-turned-mistress of David Petraeus, to her perceived love rival, Florida socialite Jill Kelley, contained confidential information about the CIA boss's movements . After Kelley contacted the FBI, agents launched a massive in-depth investigation into who was sending the emails because they shared this detailed information that was not publicly available. The catty emails, which told Kelley to 'back off' from Petraeus, were sent to Kelley from several fake email addresses. In order to find who had confidential information about Petraeus' whereabouts, the FBI obtained an administrative subpoena, and traced them back to Broadwell. Affair: David Petraeus is pictured with Paula Broadwell, his biographer and alleged mistress . Life goes on: Broadwell looked like she was preparing a salad at the home of her brother . In the course of the investigation, they also unearthed emails indicating the affair between Broadwell and Petraeus, leading to his resignation on Friday. The new details of what uncovered Petraeus' months-long relationship with his biographer come as the FBI continue to search military documents Broadwell admitted to stashing in her home. Security officials have revealed she had 'substantial' classified information on her computer which should have been stored more securely. The computer was taken from Broadwell's Charlotte, North Carolina home on Monday night after she admitted to FBI investigators that she had taken classified military documents, a source told ABC. President Obama said on Wednesday there was no indication so far that any classified documents had been found but said he will not prejudge the investigation results. Officials continue to investigate exactly how Broadwell acquired the files, but as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Military Reserve, she had security clearance to review the documents. The government had demanded she return the documents and organised the visit to her home. Prosecutors are now deciding whether to charge her with a crime.

"He had survived the perilous flight back from Nazi-occupied territory hundreds of miles away. Exhausted, the British ‘spy’ pigeon swooped down on a chimney in Surrey for a rest. And there, sadly, he fell off his perch. Perhaps overcome by fumes from the fire below, he died – with a vital coded message in a tiny capsule still strapped to his leg. Shock: David Martin with the remains of a carrier pigeon which he discovered behind his fireplace . His remains lay undiscovered in the . chimney for around 70 years until the home’s current owner David Martin . recently decided to restore the fireplace. ‘The chimney was full of twigs and . rubbish,’ he said yesterday. ‘We were stunned by how much came out. Then . I started finding bits of a dead pigeon. We thought it might be a . racing pigeon until we spotted the red capsule.’ The former probation officer and his . wife Anne, both 74, unscrewed the capsule and found a hand-written . message inside on a ‘cigarette paper thin’ piece of paper. It has been sent to code breakers at . Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, the intelligence centre where work to . crack the Nazi Enigma code shortened the war by years, and to their . modern-day counterparts at GCHQ in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, who also . are trying to decipher it. History: Historians believe the message, (left) which was written by a Sergeant W. Stott, will provide unique insight into the war. It was discovered rolled up in the red capsule attached to the pigeon (right) Complex: The message contains 27 codes, each made up of combinations of five numbers and letters . The bird could have been on its way to wartime decoding HQ Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire (pictured). Code-crackers are now frantically trying to decipher the message, which never reached its intended recipient . Carrier pigeons have been used for centuries and were used in both world wars to convey military messages. They can reach speeds of 80mph and distances of 700 miles. The RAF trained 250,000 birds in World War II, forming the National Pigeon Service. The were so relied upon that the government even introduced a special RAF squadron to cull falcons and hawks who attacked them. The birds would be dropped into Nazi occupied Europe using mini parachutes. They were then picked up and secret messages were inserted into capsules on their legs. The birds would then fly hundreds of miles back home. When they landed, wires in the coop would sound a bell or buzzer and a soldier of the Signal Corps would know a message had arrived. He would go to the coop, remove the message from the canister, and send it to its destination by telegraph, field phone, or personal messenger. Thirty two pigeons were even decorated with the Dicken Medal during the war years - the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross. Among them was Commando - a pigeon who carried out more than ninety missions during the war. Another was Kenley Lass who was the first bird to deliver intelligence from an agent in enemy-occupied France in October 1940. Dutch Coast delivered an SOS message from a ditched aircrew 288 miles in 7.5 hours in 1942. Mr Martin said: ‘It will be amazing if we . discover  an unknown detail from such an important part of British . history.’ Some 250,000 pigeons were deployed in . the Second World War. Able to fly at a mile a minute, they carried . messages from behind enemy lines and, like a forerunner of the ‘black . box’, accompanied RAF bomber crews in case they crashed. Experts say the red capsule Mr Martin . found is the type used by the Special Operations Executive. Their human . agents undertook sabotage missions such as blowing up trains, bridges . and factories in German-occupied territory. The message was written by a Sergeant W . Stott and contains  columns of groups of five letters.  It is thought . that its intended recipient, ‘X02’, is code for Bomber Command. One theory is that the message may . have been requesting a bombing raid somewhere. Another is that the . pigeon was bound for Field Marshal Montgomery’s HQ in Reigate, Surrey, . from where he planned the D-Day landings. Homing pigeons were taken on the D-Day . invasion and released  by Allied Forces to keep generals back on . English shores updated on the operation. Some pigeons were based at Bletchley . Park, which is now a museum. But Colin Hill, curator of its permanent . ‘Pigeons at War’ exhibition, said all of the pigeon  messages in its . archives are in long-hand, not code. ‘The message Mr Martin found must be . highly top secret,’ Mr Hill said. ‘The aluminium ring found on the . bird’s leg tells us it was born  in 1940, and we know it’s an Allied . Forces pigeon because of the red capsule it was carrying, but that’s all . we know.’ En route: Experts believe the pigeon and coded . message may have been flying back from Nazi Germany to General .

"A former Oklahoma doctor has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder charges in connection with the drug overdose deaths of several patients. William Valuck, a former pain management doctor, pleaded guilty to eight counts of second-degree murder under a deal with Oklahoma County prosecutors, who agreed to drop dozens of drug charges. The deal calls for 71-year-old Valuck to spend eight years in prison. Investigators have said Valuck prescribed more controlled narcotic drugs than any other physician in the state, sometimes as many as 600 pills at a time. Valuck had originally faced first-degree murder charges, which carry up to life in prison. William Valuck, right, a former pain management doctor, is pictured in a courtroom in Oklahoma City . Nearly two dozen of the victims' relatives attended the hearing, including some who spoke to the court ahead of Valuck's plea. James Lambert, whose daughter Victoria Lambert died from a drug overdose, said her death should send a message to physicians to prescribe such narcotics responsibly. He said: 'Make sure they know what they're doing when they dispense medication. That way we don't have to go through this again.' Stephanie Beesley, whose husband Paul Beesley died from a drug overdose, tearfully described his long-term fight with drug addiction as a large color portrait of him was displayed in the courtroom. 'He had a part in his own death,' she said, but added: 'I don't understand the manner in which the medications were prescribed.' Investigators have said Valuck prescribed more controlled narcotic drugs than any other physician in the state . Michael Green, the brother of drug overdose victim Christina Green, said he felt no sympathy for Valuck. 'He knew the chance he was taking,' Mr Green said. 'Eight years doesn't seem just to me. He knew this was unethical.' Valuck, wearing a gray-striped, jail-issued jumpsuit and shackled by chains at the wrists and ankles, sat with his attorneys as the statements were made. He did not speak to the victims' family members and said nothing in his own defense. Afterward, First Assistant District Attorney Scott Rowland said he agreed to accept a plea in the case to bring it to a quick resolution. 'A plea was the best way to reach finality for the families,' the prosecutor said. Rowland also said the case should serve as a warning for physicians not to place financial gain ahead of their professional responsibility. 'Eight years doesn't seem just to me. He knew this was unethical' Michael Green, relative of victim . Valuck was charged in connection with the deaths of patients who prosecutors say died of overdoses from drugs he prescribed them. Those drugs included the narcotic painkillers hydrocodone and oxycodone, as well as alprazolam, Valium and Soma. Federal and state authorities began investigating Valuck in February 2012, after being called by pharmacies and patients' relatives concerned about the amount of narcotics he was prescribing. Investigators later 'saw vanloads' of patients pull up at Valuck's pain management clinic in south Oklahoma City, where the parking lot was always full of vehicles, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Mary Surovec testified during a hearing in April. Some pharmacies even faxed to authorities copies of prescriptions Valuck had written that the pharmacies refused to fill. Surovec said DEA officials were concerned that some of the controlled drugs Valuck was prescribing in large quantities were being funneled into illegal markets and sold on the street. She said Valuck accepted only cash for office visits by patients and would not bill health insurers. After charges were filed in January, Valuck's patient files were seized and later examined by another osteopathic physician, Dr. Arthur Douglas Beacham III, who testified that drugs were prescribed by Valuck although there was no record that patients were examined to determine if the drugs were actually needed. He said patient documentation, including assessments of patient complaints, was inadequate and that in some cases there was no documentation that Valuck even saw the patient on the day he wrote a prescription.","William Valuck is a former pain management doctor .

"The extent of Newtown school shooter Adam Lanza's growing rage, isolation and delusions when he was a teenager were apparently overlooked by his mother, psychiatrists and counselors, according to a report expected to be issued next month. The report found that Lanza, who gunned down 20 children and six educators at the Sandy Hook Elementary School nearly two years ago, did not have to become a violent adult, Scott Jackson, chairman of the Sandy Hook Advisory Commission, said on Friday. It says better screening and evaluation might have helped detect earlier the 20-year-old's potential for violence. Lanza also killed his mother and then himself in the Dec. 14, 2012 violence. Scroll down for video . A report set to be issued next month claims Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza's growing rage, delusions and isolation were missed for years, despite being constantly evaluated . The information is contained in the soon-to-be released report by the Connecticut Office of the Child Advocate, Jackson said. That report will make recommendations to prevent violence in schools and among youths. Lanza was evaluated by therapists at the Yale Child Study Center in the years before he entered Newtown High School. Not only was he apparently not properly assessed, but no information from his Yale evaluations was shared with the Newtown school system, which he attended until his mother took him out of the 10th grade and home schooled him. Jackson said the failure to properly assess the degree of Lanza's mental state as a child and teenager 'could have impacted his propensity for violence' as an adult. Tragedy: Lanza, gunned down 20 children and six educators at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut nearly two years ago. Children are pictured being led away from the horrifying scene . Lanza was deemed a special education student, but his treatment apparently failed to address how he could be helped, Jackson said the report indicates. 'Violent tragedies like this one might be prevented in the future by properly diagnosing individuals and getting them the treatment they need,' Jackson said. A spokeswoman for Connecticut Child Advocate Sarah Eagan declined to comment on Friday. The gubernatorial commission, which was created to make recommendations to prevent violence, had expected to release its own report by now. However, it appears the report may not be available anytime soon since the commission voted on Friday to convene a public hearing in Newtown to gather testimony from local residents and families of victims.

"Playing in two World Cups and running out for Leeds United and Liverpool, former Socceroo Harry Kewell is used to the big stage - and they don't come much bigger than humpback whales. The 36-year-old star, who recently retired from the sport, took the day off from coaching duties to join the 40-tonne creatures in a specially guided tour off Hervey Bay, along Queensland's south east coast. Ticking off a life-long goal to go swimming with whales, the two-time World Cup player said it was a thrill to join the 16-metre monsters of the deep he'd only ever researched while watching whale documentaries. Harry Kewell kitted up his his whale diving gear to go swimming with the 40-tonne sea creatures . The champion footballer was spotted happily snapping aboard the Quick Cat II . Kewell was joined by other tourists spending the day out on the waters off Queensland's Fraser Coast . Usually the one being photographed from the field, Kewell was doing some happy snapping of his own on board the Queen Cat II as he watched the playful whales play with their new born calves. 'Obviously I've watched a lot of documentaries about them but to see them up close and personal is fantastic and we've been treated to a great show today.' Kewell was visiting the Fraser Coast, one of a number of regional locations the former Liverpool star has been stopping off at as part of his national coaching tour. The children's clinic will see him give grass roots footballers the same opportunities he had growing up with the sport, and this latest trip has given him an added personal highlight away from the footballing pitch. The guided tour gave Kewell the chance to go snorkelling with marine life and mix with 'nature at its best.' 'It's just a shame my kids aren't here,' he lamented on the tour. 'But it gives me an opportunity to come back to Hervey Bay and take them out to actually see this again...this is something that is amazing.' The day off allowed Kewell to tick off a life long dream of swimming with whales . He was looking less like the footballing star people have come to know him as with his snorkelling gear on . The 40-tonne humpback whales are migrating back to Antarctica for the summer along Australia's east coast . Now is the peak season to go whale watching in Australia with humpbacks topping to play with their new borns . A former Socceroo and footballing journeyman, Kewell played in two World Cups and represented at the elite level for top-flight English clubs Leeds United, Liverpool, and Turkish team Galatasaray before returning home to Australia to play for the Melbourne Heart. He was recently voted by fans, players and journalists as Australia's best ever footballer in April and is now enjoying post-footballing roles as a children's clinic coach. He said he is enjoying affording Australia's future stars the same opportunities he had as a young footballer. 'I've come up here to give the kids a taste of what it's like to become a footballer and to give them a bit of an insight,' he says. The whale watching experience takes place from July to October each year while humpbacks whales stop to rest and play in the protected waters off Hervey Bay. This is the peak whale watching period as humpbacks, accompanied by their new-born calves, stop to enjoy the warmer waters of the north.","Harry Kewell took time out from his coaching duties to go whale watching .

"Waiting game: David Writebol waited three weeks in quarantine before finally getting the okay to see his beloved wife Nancy, who was infected with Ebola virus while they worked in Liberia . The husband of an American missionary aid worker who contracted Ebola has emerged from 21 days of quarantine. With his three weeks of observation over, there is no longer a threat that David Writebol and he's now been reunited with his beloved wife as she recovers at Emory University. 'I have had the great joy to be able to look through the isolation room glass and see my beautiful wife again,' Mr. Writebol said in release. 'We both placed our hands on opposite sides of the glass, moved with tears to look at each other again.' Nancy is one of two American relief . workers with Ebola being treated at Emory University Hospital. The other . is Dr. Kent Brantly. Both were airlifted from Liberia in the days following the terrifying diagnosis. Writebol says his wife is continuing to gain strength. He had been quarantined at the SIM USA charity's campus south of Charlotte since he returned last week from Liberia. The . couple had been in Liberia for a year, working in a clinic. Nancy . Writebol's duties included disinfecting staff entering or leaving the . Ebola treatment area. Mrs. Writebol's recovery has likely been made possible by an experimental . Ebola treatment that was flown to Liberia at the onset of the . grandmother's disease. Brantly initially passed himself over in order for Writebol to get some of the precious experimental serum. Now Mr. Writebol reveals that was just part of a flood of compassion he and his wife have received since her diagnosis. 'In . the ensuing days, we learned much more about the disease than we . already knew.  We also learned a great deal about the love and . compassion of people toward Nancy through the overwhelming outpouring of . prayers and well-wishes on our behalf.  For this we are truly . grateful,' he said.

"Qatada was once described as Osama Bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe and even the judges in the Court of Appeal admit he is regarded as a 'very dangerous' man . The British government is to secure fresh assurances from Jordan in an attempt to finally kick hate cleric Abu Qatada out of the country. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today revealed ministers will work ‘flat out’ to deport the radical preacher after the government lost its latest court challenge to have him removed. Appeal court judges yesterday rejected a . plea from the UK government to eject Qatada, despite accepting that he . is ‘very dangerous’. Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in Mr Clegg said: ‘No one wants this guy to stay here.' But his comments appeared at odds with Justice Secretary Chris Grayling who last night blamed Lib Dem refusal to change human rights laws for the failure to give the terror suspect the boot. Mr Grayling said: ‘Labour and the Liberal Democrats’ refusal to contemplate big changes to human rights law is inexplicable given problems like this. 'I am bitterly unhappy that we have to wait until the next general election to sort this out.’ The Court of Appeal ruled that while Qatada’s deportation was ‘long overdue’, his risk to the public was not ‘a relevant consideration’ under human rights laws. The judges yesterday upheld an earlier verdict that sending the hate preacher to face a terror trial in Jordan would not be fair. Home Secretary Theresa May will now lodge a last-ditch appeal to the Supreme Court. If that fails, it would raise the prospect of Qatada – variously described as a ‘truly dangerous individual’ and Osama bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe – never being deported. He could apply to be freed within days. Ministers have been trying for a decade to send Qatada to Jordan, where he is accused of plotting a terrorist atrocity to coincide with the Millennium. Today Mr Clegg said: 'This has been going on for years and . years, it’s incredibly frustrating, I’m as frustrated as anybody this . guy shouldn’t be here, he should be deported. ‘I wish we could have deported him years ago never mind over the last few months,’ he told LBC 97.3. Scroll down for video . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he was 'frustrated' at the delays to Qatada's deportation and said Home Secretary Theresa May would seek new assurances from the Jordanian government . Qatada's removal was originally approved by the British courts, only to be halted by the European Court of Human Rights last year. Judges in Strasbourg said he would not get a fair trial because some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture. Controversially, Mrs May opted not to appeal . against this verdict. Instead, she and her ministers . secured personal promises from the Jordanian authorities there would be . no use of torture evidence, and began the deportation process again in . the UK legal system. But last November, the Special . Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) said it was not satisfied with the . assurances, and halted Qatada’s removal. The court said it must reflect . the Strasbourg ruling. That decision was yesterday unanimously upheld by Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls, and two other Appeal Court judges. Mr Clegg said Mrs May would step up attempts to reach a deal with Jordan that reassures the courts that Qatada will get a fair trial. He said: ‘It’s been this endless legal ping pong, the European Court interestingly enough actually found against Abu Qatada and said that his appeal against deportation was wrong. ‘But the courts both here and elsewhere have said that there’s this legal issue about whether the assurances that the Jordanians have given us about how their court system works is kind of sufficiently strong and that’s where the legal argument has got stuck. ‘Theresa May has been out to Jordan, she’s going to work flat out to make sure that we strengthen those assurances from the Jordanians, we are absolutely determined as a government to deport this guy, I wish we could do it earlier.  We have to jump through these endless legal hoops but we will get there.’","Deputy PM says he wants to kick radical cleric out but Tories blame Lib Dem refusal to change human rights laws .

"Laura Wilson was just 17-years-old when she was stabbed to death next to a canal in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, in 2010. This wasn't a mugging gone wrong, or a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. In fact, the mother-of-one was the victim of Britain's first white honour killing. Her death was premeditated murder, plotted and committed by the boyfriend she was madly in love with. Laura's crime was to bring dishonour on her Muslim lover Ashtiaq Ashgar, 21, who is now serving a life sentence for the brutal murder. Scroll down for video . By the time she was 15, Laura Wilson, from Rotherham, was besotted with Ashtiaq Ashgar, 16 . In 2008, the couple began an intense relationship at school when Laura was just 15, and Ashtiaq, 16. Her sister, Sarah, reveals on tonight's episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos on Crime & Investigation Network: 'She loved him. She worshipped the ground he walked on, she really did. She would have done anything for him.' Ashtiaq came from a traditional Muslim family who were planning an arranged marriage for their son with a girl from Pakistan. They would have been horrified to learn he was dating a white girl so he made Laura keep their relationship a secret. Unbeknown to his family, he lived a double life where he drank, smoked cannabis, carried weapons and had numerous relationship with women, including Laura. When Laura found out that he has been seeing other girls, they broke up and she slept with this married friend, 22-year-old Ishaq 'Zac' Hussein, to make him jealous. Only 16, she fell pregnant as a result of the fling and had a daughter, Alicia. Zac refused to acknowledge he was the father. After Alicia is born, Laura and Ashtiaq rekindled their relationship but he insisted it must continue to be a secret. But while Laura was very much in love, her mother, Maggie, believes Ashtiaq was just using Laura for sex and treated her badly. She said: 'I heard a phone conversation between Laura and Ashtiaq, Laura telling him how much he loved him and he was just so nasty. You could hear Laura crying in the background. He was saying just how much he hated her and that he'd got another girl, and he wasn't interested in her and she's shouting back ""I love ya, I love ya…"". He used Laura I think at the end.' Ashgar comes from a very traditional Muslim family and was leading a secret life, which Laura was a part of . The two broke up and Laura began a short relationship with a married friend of his . Laura soon became sick of being  Ashtiaq secret and on October 6, 2010, fuelled by alcohol, she and her sister made the fatal mistake of revealing all to his family. They knocked on his mother's door and told her what was going on. Sarah recalls: 'Laura told her that she wanted to marry him, but his mother got aggressive and hit her with a shoe, calling her ""a dirty white b****"".' The whole time Ashtiaq stood behind his mother 'acting sheepish'. When sentenced, Ashgar 'showed no remorse', he was just upset at the amount of jail time he received . The public episode would have been deeply shameful and embarrassing to him. On a roll, Laura and Sarah also visited Zac's family to reveal how he is the father of her baby. Maggie recalls: 'She said ""I am sick of her being a secret"" as she had been told not to mention about Alicia to any of the family. So she told them but they just didn’t want to know.' Maggie added that Laura's relations with Ashtiaq and Zac had 'fetched shame on their family… she had to be stopped.' In the days following Sarah and Laura turning up at their houses, an angry Ashtiaq sent Zac a text message saying: 'I'm gonna send that b***** to Hell.' He also said he wanted to make 'beans on toast' of her, which is a phrase that means to spill blood. He asked Laura to meet him at the canal one evening and it's there that he murdered her. When Laura did not return home that evening, Maggie said she 'just knew' something terrible had happened. Meanwhile, Ashtiaq was trying to cover his tracks by texting Laura's friend asking if she had 'seen' her. Two days later, Laura's body was found in the canal. She had more than 40 stab wounds, most of those to the head, and some were defence wounds. Maggie had to go identify her daughter. SHe said: 'I went over and kissed her and I put my arms around her and I just sobbed.' The day after Laura went missing, mother Maggie (left) 'knew' something terrible had happened . Sarah was overwhelmed with guilt. She said: 'If it was going to be anyone it should have been me. It was my choice to go and knock on Ashtiaq's door, it was my choice to go and knock on Zac's door. She had everything to live for.' Police charged Ashtiaq and Zac with murder - describing the case as Britain's first white honour based killing. Both men pleaded not guilty. On May 2011 at Ashtiaq's trial, the court heard how after . stabbing Laura, he threw her into the canal but she kept fighting for . her life. A pathologist report found that the stab wounds to the head . were actually done to keep her under the water. On . June 1 Ashtiaq changed his plea to guilty in the hope of a reduced . sentence, as the evidence was stacking up against him.

"Startling hidden camera footage shows migrants crossing illegally into the U.S. from Mexico, via a couple's private property. Jim and Sue Chilton run a 50,000-acre cattle ranch southwest of Tucson, Arizona and for years they've complained about illegal immigrants - and suspected drug cartel members - jumping the four-strand wire fence that marks their 5 1/2-mile border with Mexico. The couple even testified before Congress about the issue plaguing other Americans like them, who are abandoned by border patrol officers who maintain only a limited presence on rugged areas of the border. Scroll down for video . Sneaking across: Hidden camera footage shows illegal immigrants crossing into the U.S. from Mexico on an American couple's 50,000-acre ranch in southern Arizona . Delivery men: Jim and Sue Chilton run a cattle ranch that spans 5 1/2 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. Above, more migrants walking on their property with large packs usually used to transport drugs . To prove just how at risk they are, the couple enlisted the help of border-security advocacy group SecureBorderIntel.org to set up several hidden cameras on their property. The group installed the cameras in well traveled paths about 10-15 miles north of the international border in March and April. In June, they came back to the property and the Chilton's worst nightmares were confirmed: migrants, many carrying large packs used for drug smuggling, hiking over their ranch. 'It just confirmed what we already knew,' Jim Chilton told NBC News. 'We have ceded to the cartels 20 miles, 30 miles inside the United States.' On their own: Some American land-owners like the Chiltons are left defenseless on the border, since the land it too rugged to patrol . Ranchers like the Chiltons are particularly at risk because they live in a no-man's land along the border. While U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has more officers than ever maintaining the border, they leave rugged areas of land like the Chilton's Ranch relatively unchecked and instead patrol further north where it's easier to catch illegal immigrants. Sue Chilton says she used to roam about her ranch freely, but now never goes without an escort for fear of becoming another victim of the aggressive cartels. Another group caught on the hidden cameras is dressed in all camouflage while carrying much lighter packs . Without a trace: One in the group stays behind to sweep up their tracks . The 2010 unsolved murder of Arizona rancher Rob Krentz is believed to have been carried out by a smuggler who shot the man to death on his own land. 'The fear we have is running across a group coming across with an AK-47 dressed in camouflage garb and carpet shows and small backpacks on their backs carrying meth, crack or heroin,' her husband Jim said. Many smugglers wear carpet shoes while crossing the borders to cover up their tracks. In one of the hidden camera videos, a group is seen in all camo walking on the ranch while a man in the back sweeps up their steps. The Chiltons say they find evidence of illigal immigrants on their land all the time, such as break-ins at their home and trash and clothing left behind.","Jim and Sue Chilton run a 50,000-acre cattle ranch in Arizona that shares a 5 1/2-mile border with Mexico .

"Save the Children faced a growing wave of protest last night as donors, volunteers and a celebrity ambassador for the charity condemned its decision to give a high-profile anti-poverty award to Tony Blair. Angry former supporters took to social media to say they would be cancelling regular donations, and more than 100,000 people signed a petition demanding the charity withdraw the ‘global legacy award’. The charity’s boss yesterday admitted the decision to honour the divisive former Prime Minister had created ‘global repercussions’ for its reputation. Tony Blair, pictured, visiting a Palestinian refugee camp in 2007. He is a peace envoy to the Middle East . Tony Blair, right, signed a memorandum of understanding last night with Stefania Giannini, left, in Rome as part of his Faith Foundation to counter religious prejudice, conflict and extremism across the world . However, more than 200 members of staff from Save the Children have condemned Mr Blair's award . Save the Children International chief executive Jasmine Whitbread sent a humiliating email apologising to staff for not consulting them about the award, saying they had been ‘blind sighted’. But she also issued a lengthy defence of the decision to grant it. The charity’s Facebook page was deluged with critical comments about the award given to Mr Blair by its US arm at a star-studded ceremony in New York last week for the last Labour government’s aid effort. On Twitter comedian Dom Joly wrote that he was ‘pretty embarrassed’ to be an ambassador for the charity ‘when they hand out awards to Tony Blair for his “anti-poverty” work’, adding: ‘I can only assume they meant his own, personal poverty?’ Yesterday the Daily Mail reported how 200 Save the Children staff have signed a letter condemning the award as ‘morally reprehensible’ and ‘a betrayal’ of the charity’s principles. Social media users criticised the decision . Former City executive Miss Whitbread became the focus of fury earlier this year when it emerged Save the Children International paid its top employee, thought to be her, a total of £234,000 a year – one of 20 staff earning more than £100,000. In her message to staff she said the award went down well in the US and in other countries but admitted ‘we have seen (and should have anticipated) concerns raised elsewhere in the world’. She added that in future there would be ‘a more robust process of consultation, risk assessment and internal communications for any member decisions likely to have global repercussions on our brand’. Defending the award, she said it was for Mr Blair’s leadership on international development, increased aid spending and his hosting of debt relief summits. The backlash against the charity emerged in a flood of critical messages on Twitter and the charity’s own Facebook pages. Some former supporters called for the charity’s chief executive to be sacked while others insisted they would never make another donation until the award is withdrawn. One former employee of the charity, Paul Woodhead, wrote: ‘Save the Children unrecognisable (and not in a good way) from the organisation I worked in for 20 years. #Blair.’ On Facebook, volunteer Dave Owen posted: ‘I have opened my garden for years as a fundraiser for STC, but no more, unless the obscene award to Warmongerer Blair is revoked.’ Yesterday a volunteer at a Save the Children charity shop in South London said they had received angry calls threatening to stop donations. The volunteer, who did not wish to be named, said of the award: ‘I don’t think it should have happened.’ By yesterday evening a petition on the 38 Degrees website calling for the award to be revoked had attracted more than 102,000 signatures. Miranda Pinch, founder of the petition, told Channel 4 News in an apparent reference to Iraq, which Britain invaded in 2003 when Mr Blair was Premier, that he is ‘remembered for the great deal of suffering he caused to the children of the Middle East’. She said: ‘In accepting this award from Save the Children, he is doing them a great disservice. I have had a lot of emails from people saying how horrified they are that someone like him should be able to accept an award when to many, he’s done the very opposite of saving the children. ‘It’s not good for a charity that wants a very broad range of people to give money to them. There are other people that are doing good things in Africa. Why not give someone who has less recognition or public profile an award?’ Critics have also pointed out that two former aides of Mr Blair have significant roles in Save the Children, including Justin Forsyth who worked in Downing Street from 2004 to 2010 and is now the chief executive of Save the Children UK. Jonathan Powell, who was Mr Blair’s chief of staff, is on the board of Save the Children International. At Prime Minister’s Questions David Cameron – whose wife is an ambassador for Save the Children UK – said: ‘The remarkable thing about this award is that Tony Blair got it from someone who used to work for Gordon Brown.’ John McTernan, Tony Blair’s director of political operations between 2005 and 2007, said: ‘The award was for Tony Blair’s commitment to Africa. This is an attack on Save the Children. Tony Blair doesn’t need the award. The work needs the recognition.’ Asked if Mr Blair should have turned down the award, he replied: ‘No’.

"Bad decision: Half of Britain's gold reserves were sold for £2bn in 1999 by Gordon Brown (file picture) The gold reserves held by Britain that were disastrously sold off by Gordon Brown would be worth six times as much today at £11bn, the Chancellor revealed in his budget speech today. George Osborne said that the Government had been rebuilding the country's reserves of the precious metal after former chancellor Brown sold them in 1999. The decision to sell half of Britain's reserves when the price of gold was at a 20-year low low caused stinging criticism of the man who succeeded Tony Blair as prime minister. Brown sold the gold for £2bn when gold was valued at just $300 an ounce. The sale came shortly before bullion started a blistering rally that took prices to a record high of $1,920.30 an ounce in September 2011. The same gold reserves would be worth £11bn today. The Chancellor said in his budget speech today: 'We are also taking the opportunity to rebuild Britain's reserves, which had fallen to historically low levels. 'I can confirm our gold holdings have risen in value to £11 billion. This does not include the 400 or so tonnes of gold sold a decade ago for £2 billion, and which would now be worth six times that at over £13 billion pounds. Mr Osborne's jibe in the House of Commons was greeted raucously from Conservative ministers as embarrassed Labour MPs could only look on. When asked if the Treasury had plans to increase the amount of gold Britain holds, currently 9.975 million ounces, valued at 11 billion pounds ($17.44 billion),  unsurprisingly the spokesman said: 'There aren't.' The gold price, which has risen by around 6 percent this year, was up 0.1 percent today at $1,652.90 . Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, left, after his budget speech today. Right, former chancellor Gordon Brown . Mr Brown's decision to sell the gold when he was Chancellor is regarded as one of the Treasury's worst financial mistakes and has cost taxpayers almost £7 billion. Despite repeated campaigns to shed light on the issues, Mr Brown and the Treasury have repeatedly refused to give any information about the sale amid allegations that warnings were ignored. The issue also blighted Labour's general election campaign and underpinned claims that they had mismanaged the economy. George Osborne said at the time: 'Gordon Brown's decision to sell off our gold reserves at the bottom of the market cost the British taxpayer billions of pounds. It was one of the worst economic judgements ever made by a chancellor. 'The British public have a right to know what happened and why so much of their money was lost. The documents should be published immediately.' It has been suggested that Mr Brown forced through the sale of the reserves despite serious concerns from the Bank of England. It is not thought that senior Bank experts were even consulted about the decision, which was driven through by a small group of senior Treasury aides close to Mr Brown. These included Ed Balls and Ed Miliband.","Price of bullion was at 20-year low when Brown sold 400 tonnes for £2bn in 1999 .

"Following on from his glory days on the racecourse, Frankel the super horse has been kicking back and enjoying retirement on the back of a 14-race unbeaten career. But his stamina will be tested once again on Valentine's Day when he has his first encounter with a mare. The breeding season runs from February 14 to July 14 and breeders from around the world are queuing up to pay the £125,000 fee. Champion: Tom Queally winning at Newbury Racecourse riding Frankel who has been dubbed the best racehorse in the world . What are you looking at? Frankel gets adjusted to life as a stud . Even though the stallion's libido has not been tested, he is expected to 'cover' up to three mares a day at his home in Banstead Manor Stud in Newmarket. Mares will be brought to nearby stables where they will be monitored and presented when they are most likely to conceive. Before the encounter they will also be teased by pony stallions and checked they are ready for mating to avoid  Frankel being snubbed by a mare who is not in the mood. Mares which have already been booked include German mare Danedream, winner of the 2011 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, the Japanese champion Vodka, and Oatsee, the former racehorse bred in America which is considered among the world's finest broodmares. And he is booked for the next three years. Proud moment: Trainer Henry Cecil with Frankel who retired after 14 unbeaten races . Tom Queally hugs horse Frankel after winning The Champion Stakes during the British Champions Day at Ascot . Nicknamed 'Usain Colt', the five-year-old thoroughbred was cheered on by a 32,000 sell-out crowd when he stormed to victory at Ascot in his final outing last year earning him the crown of best racehorse in the world. He has been enjoying retirement in stud at Newmarket and is expected to earn around £200million for his owner Prince KhalidAbdullah, a member of the Saudi Arabian ruling family. The equine superstar was trained by Sir Henry Cecil. But to get him ready for life as a stud stallion, Frankel is now enjoying gentle walks instead of energetic gallops. It is also hoped his stablemates will make Frankel feel at ease. Lord Grimthorpe, Prince Khalid's racing manager, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'The demand is huge because Frankel is a worldwide phenomenon. But not just any mare can come and see him. 'The horses will undoubtedly communicate. 'The other stallions will have told him, 'It isn't a bad life, mate'.","Nicknamed 'Usain Colt' the thoroughbred is settling into stud .

A bipartisan provision in the 2010 . healthcare reform law allows employers to reward workers who . participate and penalize those who don't. Scroll down for videos . Upset: Leading U.S. CEOs, angered bythe Obama administration's challenge to certain 'workplace wellness' programs, are threatening to side with anti-Obamacareforces . But recent lawsuits filed by the administration's Equal . Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), challenging the . programs at Honeywell International and two smaller . companies, have thrown the future of that part of Obamacare into . doubt. The lawsuits infuriated some large employers so much that . they are considering aligning themselves with Obama's opponents, . according to people familiar with the executives' thinking. 'The fact that the EEOC sued is shocking to our members,' said Maria Ghazal, vice-president and counsel at the Business . Roundtable, a group of chief executives of more than 200 large . U.S. corporations. 'They don't understand why a plan in . compliance with the ACA (Affordable Care Act) is the target of a . lawsuit,"" she said. 'This is a major issue to our members.' She then added, 'There have been conversations at the most senior levels of . the administration about this.' Business Roundtable members are due to meet Obama in a . closed-door session on Tuesday, where they may air their . concerns. It is not clear how many members of the group, whose . companies sponsor health insurance for 40 million people, are . considering any action. It is also not clear if the White House . can stop the EEOC from challenging wellness programs. Angered: Maria Ghazal (above), vice-president and counsel at the BusinessRoundtable, which represents over 200 corporations, is due to meet Obama in aclosed-door session on Tuesday . Obamacare allows financial incentives for workers taking . part in workplace wellness programs of up to 50 percent of their . monthly premiums, deductibles, and other costs. That translates . into hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars in extra annual . costs for those who do not participate. Typically, participation means filling out detailed health . questionnaires, undergoing medical screenings, and in some cases . attending weight-loss or smoking-cessation programs. One of the arguments presented in the lawsuit against three . employers is that requiring medical testing violates the . Americans with Disabilities Act. The lawsuits are based on the view that it is no longer . voluntary if employees face up to $4,000 in penalties for . non-participation, loss of insurance or even their jobs. Employers, however, see the lawsuits as reneging on the . administration's commitment to an important part of the . healthcare reform. In practical terms, large corporations have several ways to . undermine Obamacare if they decide to. One is to support legal challenges to the subsidies given to . low-income individuals who buy health insurance on the federal . exchange established under the law. Neither the Business . Roundtable nor any of its CEO members have done this so far. Another option is to make top executives available for . hearings on repealing or diluting Obamacare. 'We never did this . before,' said the person familiar with the executives' thinking. 'But they could turn up the noise. I don't think the White House . would want the CEOs turning on them and supporting these efforts . on the Hill.' The nuclear option would be to radically change . employer-sponsored health insurance. Large corporations are . highly unlikely to eliminate it, but they might give workers a . fixed amount of money to buy coverage on a private insurance . exchange. That would allow employers, almost all of which pay . workers' medical claims out of their earnings, to cap their . healthcare spending.","Many CEOs are angry with the Obama administration thanks to three new cases challenging parts of his 'wellness program'

"Al Qaeda planned to hijack cruise ships and post footage of passengers being executed online to pressurise governments to release particular prisoners, it has been revealed. Documents embedded inside a pornographic movie, on a memory disc, show how the terror network wanted to dress tourists up in Guantanamo Bay-style orange jumpsuits before murdering them.

Scroll down to see video... Hijack: Al Qaeda wanted to seize cruise ships and post footage of passengers being executed online to pressurise governments to release particular prisoners (file picture) Execution: Al Qaeda wanted to dress cruise ship passengers up in Guantanamo Bay-style orange jumpsuits and then film their murders to post footage online . Osama bin Laden may have ordered the slaughter of the 9/11 attacks but he drew the line at a bloodthirsty killing machine dubbed the 'human lawn mower', according to papers seized from his compound. An idea to fix rotating blades to the front of a pickup truck and drive it into crowds, mowing innocent people down like weeds, attracted widespread enthusiasm among Al Qaeda supporters on the internet last year. But documents seized from the Bin Laden compound in Pakistan reveal that the Al Qaeda leader felt it was a step too far even for the terror group, according to intelligence officials who have read them. 'He was upset about it,' a former US intelligence official told the Washington Post. 'He felt it conflicted with what his vision for what he wanted Al Qaeda to be.' Newly released excerpts from the al Qaeda papers seized when Navy SEAL commandos stormed his compound a year ago reveal how bin Laden was struggling to maintain his influence in a terror group whose command structure had been severely weakened by US drone attacks. And, incredibly, the documents suggest the man who ordered two planes to fly into New York’s World Trade Centre was concerned that Al Qaeda’s public image was being tarnished by the atrocities being carried out in its name in Iraq and other parts of the Middle East. In the months before his death bin Laden had backed a Libyan-born al Qaeda 'moderate', Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, in drawing up a code of behaviour that would rein in what they regarded as the worst excesses of Al Qaeda activity. Although both men remained convinced it was their group’s duty to kill westerners, including civilians, they felt that murdering fellow Muslims was 'bad for their public image', said Al Qaeda expert Jarret Brachman. Tom Leonard . The cache of 141 documents, described as 'pure gold' by intelligence agencies, also details how the network wanted to conduct a Mumbai-style attack - where ten gunmen killed 164 people in a three-day rampage in 2008 - in Europe. And it reveals the organisation is using a 'twin-track strategy' - using 'low-cost, low-tech attacks' to keep security services preoccupied as other 'operatives' plan large-scale 9/11 type atrocities. The documents, seized by German intelligence operatives in the days following Osama Bin Laden's death last year, reveal an 'extraordinarily detailed insight into the inner workings of Al Qaeda'. They also state some of the tactics used by the organisation as it attempts to elude the counter-terrorism initiatives of the world’s military and intelligence agencies. CNN reports how Al Qaeda's hand in . the London 7/7 and attempted 7/21 bomb plots emerges for the first time . with a highly detailed account from cell leader Rashid Rauf. CNN's Nic Robertson said: 'These documents show that London was extremely lucky on 7/21. 'The terrorists were using the same . bomb-building instructions as the 7/7 bombers, who had actually . encountered the same problem with the way they had mixed their . explosives. 'The 7/7 bombers had closer contacts with Rauf and were able to contact him and change their bombs so that they worked.' The . 46 page document outlines how and why the liquid explosive plot took . shape and explains how counter-surveillance measures by the 21/7 bombers . threw security officers off their scent. The . files also contain details of the ways in which Al Qaeda seeks to learn . from its mistakes, and the levels of sophistication and determination . within its ranks. In . addition, they reveal the impact that military drone strikes and . infiltration by intelligence agencies are having on al Qaeda's numbers . and behaviour. Robertson . added: 'These documents lay open Al Qaeda’s inner workings. They prove . the links between some of its highest profile plots and attacks, and . show how it's trying to cope with the constant pressure from military . and intelligence operations against it.' The . documents were discovered on the memory disc when Austrian 22-year-old . Maqsood Lodin was arrested following his return to Germany from . Pakistan. Buried amongst the files was a pornographic video called Kick Ass, and a document marked 'Sexy Tanja'. It . took German investigators several weeks to decrypt the file, but when . they did they found an inside track on some of the terror group's most . audacious plots and a road map for future operations. PDF . terrorist training manuals in German, English and Arabic were also . found in what U.S. intelligence sources say is the most important haul . of terrorist materials in the last year. Lodin . and another man called Yusuf Ocak, who allegedly travelled back to . Europe with him, are now on trial in Berlin where they are pleading not . guilty to terror offences. Ocak was detained in Vienna two weeks after Lodin's arrest.

Some parents make them fit in with their own style, rather than treating them as individuals. 'It is not like older children dressing up for fun. It is potentially objectifying babies who have no say in what they wear. 'Obviously it is not directly harmful for the baby itself. But it says something about the attitude of the adults who are meant to nurture that infant.' Little Angels: Renowned London costumiers Angels in Covent Garden have seen a growing UK trend for fancy-dressing babies, and sell the This Lil Piggy and the Leapin Leopard costumes for infants for £19.99 . Miss Knights added Halloween has become a 'marketing opportunity' for businesses, and said they risk commercialising children in their quest for profit. She said: 'Halloween used to be much bigger in America than in Britain. Now hard-pressed families over here are spending more and more of their cash on Halloween accessories and costumes. It is a great marketing opportunity for businesses. As the market in teenage and children’s products becomes saturated, they are turning their attention to young babies. 'It is all part of the creeping commercialisation of childhood. Yes, it can be fun. But what does it say about our society?'

"He is known to be somewhat private when it comes to his life as a family man. But in suing a magazine company for defaming his parenting skills, Tom Cruise has now found intimate details of personal life come to light - including how Scientology played a part in his split from ex-wife Katie Holmes. Cruise, 51, has filed a $50million lawsuit against Bauer Publishing for their 2012 cover stories of both Life & Style and In Touch that claimed he had 'abandoned' his daughter Suri after divorcing Holmes on 29 June 2012. 'Not an ideal situation': Tom Cruise is suing Life & Style and InTouch for claiming in two cover stories that he had 'abandoned' his daughter Suri . Now Radar have obtained a 48-page transcript of a gruelling deposition held in September this year with attorney Elizabeth McNamara, in which Cruise admits he did not see his daughter Suri for 110 days after his divorce. Radar reports how when asked if his former wife Holmes, 34, had tried to 'protect' Suri from Scientology, Cruise hit back. 'Listen, I find that question offensive,' he is quoted. 'I find it, those statements offensive. Like with any relationship, there are many different levels to it. You know, I, I find it very offensive. There is no need to protect my daughter from my religion.' Cruise was then asked if Scientology . was on of the reasons Holmes left him, to which he appeared to admit, . replying: 'Did she say that? That was one of the assertions, yes.' The actor also confirmed that seven-year-old Suri is not longer practising Scientology. In happier times: Tom and Kate are seen doting over their daughter Suri in New York in 2008 during Katie's rehearsals for the Broadway play All My Sons . He was then asked if this meant Holmes would be considered a 'Suppressive Person' - a Scientology term used to describe members of the controversial religion who publicly renounce their faith. 'That is a distortion and a simplification of the matter,' he is said to have replied. '...I don’t want to just give an oversimplification of religious doctrine.' The site report that an 'angry' Cruise began to explain 'when there is a divorce... things change' at the interrogation held at the LA offices of Cruise's lawyer. In the document, McNamara probes Tom: 'From June 18 of 2012 until Thanksgiving of 2012, you only say Suri a few times, isn’t that right?,' to which Cruise replies, 'yes'. Deposition: Radar report that an 'angry' Cruise began to explain 'when there is a divorce... things change' at the interrogation held at the LA offices of Cruise's lawyer. McNamara then continues to calculate . the time that Cruise spent with his daughter Suri following his divorce . with Holmes, which totalled 10 days. Cruise then offers that during that time he was able to remain in Suri's life through conversations on the telephone. 'I’ve gotten very good at it. I’ve gotten very good at it. I tell wonderful stories and they like hearing it.' But McNamara replied, 'It really doesn’t substitute for being able to be there does it?' 'No, it doesn’t,' Cruise replied. McNamara pushed further when questioning why Cruise was able to attend a Scientology event and return to his filming schedule within 24 hours, but not make a visit to his daughter. 'That’s not true... different situation,' Cruise is quoted as saying. Defending his parenting skills: Tom Cruise has filed documents stating he has 'in no way cut Suri out' of his life. He is pictured with his youngest daughter in July 2012 . The deposition becomes even more . intense when McNamara compares Cruise's parenting skills to his own . father Thomas Mapother III, who allegedly left Cruise when he was a . child. 'The fact that you would suggest that I was being like my father… I find that greatly offensive.' The case - which is expected to go to trial next year - will see Cruise sue In Touch and Life & Style for libel and defamation. While the lawsuit drags on, Tom's ex-wife Katie has been seen in South Africa, where she is filming. Holmes - who recently joined Twitter - posted about the trip, saying: 'So happy to be on twitter!!!!!! Sending first tweets from South Africa!!!!! (sic).' Far apart: Katie Holmes and daughter Suri Cruise are currently enjoying a break in Cape Town, South Africa .

"Judge Lindsey Kushner QC said Costel lent his nation a bad name at Manchester Crown Court . A judge has slammed a Romanian thief who stole 27 smartphones worth £9,000 from Limp Bizkit fans at a gig in Manchester gig telling him: 'We do not want criminals such as yourself in this country.' Police raided Stefu Costel's flat in Chorlton, Manchester, and found 27 handsets stuffed inside a plastic carrier bag. All of them had been stolen from fans in the crowd during the gig by the American nu metal band at The Academy venue on Oxford Road in Manchester in February, Manchester Crown Court was told. Costel, . 30, orginally from Romania, claimed he was given the bag to look after . by his brother's friend but was jailed for 14 months after he pleaded . guilty to handling stolen goods. Judge Lindsey Kushner QC said Costel was part of what amounted to an 'absolute plague' in the UK. She said: 'It lends his nation a bad name. Everybody gets tarred with the same brush. 'He is one of those people in one of those gangs who go to public events and sweep through everyone. 'These are offences that are a plague on all of us. 'It is not just a bit of pick-pocketing. It is a rash. It is a gang stealing, and you are part of that arrangement. 'We do not want criminals such as yourself in this country.' The career criminal had a previous conviction for conspiring to steal from bank customers in a debit and credit card scam. Costel, who was living in Railway Terrace in Chorlton at the time, was also jailed last year for stealing mobile phones from music fans at ReadingFestival. Twenty-seven phones were stolen from Manchester Academy venue (pictured) at a Limp Bizkit gig . Tim Greenald, prosecuting, told the court that Limp Bizkit fans in Manchester were unaware they had been targeted during the gig. He said the majority of fans hit were men who had smartphones swiped from their pockets. Handsets were a mixture of iPhones, Samsung Galaxy phones, HTC phones and Sony Xperia phones. The fans of Limp Bizkit (pictured) were watching the band at The Academy in Manchester . All will now be returned. Mr Greenald said: 'They were not aware of the thefts when they took place but realised that they had become victims during the night. 'It was an organised and planned theft most likely committed by more than one person with a degree of skill used. Judge Lindsey Kushner QC said Costel lent his nation a bad name at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) 'He denied knowledge there were mobile phones in the bag and said he did not benefit financially.' The police raid at his home came just two days after the thefts at the gig. Nicola Gatto, defending, said Costel had an 'acute psychotic disorder' and wanted to return to Romania.","Police raided Stefu Costel's flat in Chorlton, Manchester .

"Millions of barren patches of land, known as ‘fairy circles’, can be found across the Namib Desert in southern Africa. The mystery of how they got there, or why they stay there, has stumped scientists for decades. Theories have included grass-killing gas, termites and even UFOs while local myth holds that a fire-breathing dragon lives beneath the Earth and burns the vegetation. Millions of barren patches of land, known as 'fairy circles', can be found across the Namib Desert in southern Africa. The mystery of how they got there, or why they stay there, has stumped scientists for decades . But these strange patterns may in fact be the result of underground competition for resources among plants, according to new research by Michael Cramer at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. Fairy circles, which can be 2-12m in diameter, are found in the region’s arid grassland on sandy soils. A ring of vegetation that is taller than the grassland usually surrounds the barren patch. The theory states that the nutrient-poor soil and lack of rainfall causes increased competition between plants in the Namib Desert. The stronger types of grass soak up all the nutrients causing other plants in the area to die. This leaves a barren patch in the landscape which later becomes a reservoir for nutrients and water.

Theories . have included grass-killing gas, termites and even UFOs while local . myth holds that a dragon lives beneath the Earth and his fiery breath . burns the vegetation. ‘The consequent barren circle may provide a resource-reservoir essential for the survival of the larger peripheral grasses,’ said the researchers, writing in the journal PLOS ONE. ‘It's a really good theory because it accounts for all the characteristics of fairy circles,’ Florida State University biologist Walter Tschinkel, who was not involved in the study, told LiveScience. ‘No other proposed cause for fairy circles has ever done that.’ In April Norbert Jürgens from the University of Hamburg claimed that a species of sand termite was responsible for the patterns. He examined hundreds of fairy circles in more than 1,200 miles of the desert and found that the Psammotermes allocerus, or sand termite, was the only species consistently present. Mr Jürgens theory states that they eat plant roots before they can sprout through the desert soil creating a water trap - in a similar way that beavers create dams. Because of the lack of foliage, rainwater is not lost through transpiration (the evaporation of water from plants) and instead stays below the surface. In April Norbert Jürgens from the University of Hamburg proposed that a species of sand termite was responsible for the patterns. He examined hundreds of fairy circles in more than 1,200 miles of the desert and found that the Psammotermes allocerus, or sand termite, was the only species consistently present . This allows the sand termites to survive and stay active during the dry season and also helps grasses at the edge of the circle to thrive attracting other life forms. The termites feed on those grasses, thereby gradually extending the circle. Mr Jürgens concluded that the fairy circles are actually an astounding example of ecological engineering by the sand termite, designed to retain precious water in an otherwise arid landscape. Mr Cramer, lead researcher of the current study, has dismissed the termite theory. ‘I think the major hurdle that explanations have to overcome is explaining the regular spacing of the circles, their approximate circularity and their size,’ Mr Cramer told LiveScience. ‘There's no real reason why termites would produce such large circles that are so evenly spaced.’ The current theory is backed up by previous research in which mathematical models show that the vegetation pattern of fairy circles could depend on water availability.

"David Cameron and George Osborne are facing questions about their roles in the controversial BSkyB bid after James Murdoch claimed he had discussed it with both men. Mr Murdoch said he raised the subject with the Prime Minister during a cosy Christmas dinner at the Cotswolds home of former News International boss Rebekah Brooks. Downing Street spent months dodging questions about that occasion, which took place on December 23, 2010, two days after Business Secretary Vince Cable had been stripped of responsibility for the bid and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt had taken charge. Cosy relationship: David Cameron and former News International boss Rebekah Brooks together. James Murdoch discussed the BSkyB takeover with the Prime Minister at her dinner . Initially, Number Ten refused to provide a date or even suggest whether the dinner took place – and when it did, sources were quoted as saying neither Rupert Murdoch’s takeover bid for BSkyB nor the phone hacking scandal were discussed. Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson, a guest at the dinner as another member of the so-called ‘Chipping Norton set’, insisted: ‘BSkyB was not mentioned. Nor was phone hacking.’ The Prime Minister himself later told Parliament he ‘never had one inappropriate conversation’ with Mr Murdoch and ‘completely took myself out of any decision making about this bid’. But appearing at the Leveson inquiry yesterday, Mr Murdoch, 41, revealed he had used the Christmas get-together to seek assurances from the PM about News International’s plans to buy BSkyB. He said he wanted to know that Jeremy Hunt, the new minister overseeing the bid, would be more ‘objective’ than his ‘acutely biased’ predecessor Mr Cable. Mr Murdoch said he and Mr Cameron discussed the revelation that Mr Cable had been caught privately ‘declaring war’ on the Murdoch empire, a disclosure which meant Mr Hunt being handed responsibility for the bid. Little chat: Mr Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that he . had a 'tiny, side conversation' with the Prime Minister about the takeover of BskyB ahead of a . dinner for up to 15 people at the Chipping Norton home of Mrs Brooks . ‘He reiterated what he had said . publicly, which is that the behaviour had been unacceptable, and I . imagine I expressed the hope that things would be dealt with in a way . that was appropriate and judicial,’ Mr Murdoch said. ‘It was a tiny conversation ahead of a dinner where all these people were there, so it wasn’t really a discussion.’ Mr Cameron was accused last year of . breaking Parliament’s ministerial code of conduct, which requires . ministers to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest, by . attending the Christmas dinner, a claim which was dismissed. But for the Prime Minister, the . revelations about the Christmas dinner mark an unwelcome return to the . subject of his closeness to Mrs Brooks, the former chief executive of . News International. It also has uncomfortable echoes of . last month’s ‘horsegate’ saga, in which Mr Cameron was reluctant to . admit riding a retired police horse that Mrs Brooks had been loaned by . the Metropolitan Police. He was eventually forced to confess he . may have ridden the horse with Mrs Brooks’s racehorse owner husband . Charlie, a friend from their Eton days. Scrutiny of Mr Cameron’s friendships . with News International executives is likely to be heightened by another . disclosure by Mr Murdoch yesterday – that he personally informed him . The Sun would be backing the Conservatives at the next election. Over drinks at The George Club in . London on September 10, 2009, Mr Murdoch said ‘it was made clear to Mr . Cameron by me’ that The Sun would be switching allegiance from Labour. Dinner hosts: Mrs Brooks and her husband hosted the Christmas meal at their home in the Cotswolds . The media baron denied this was part of a deal to trade favours with Mr Cameron. His wife, Kathryn Murdoch, who was . sitting in the public gallery along with Mr Murdoch’s brother Lachlan, . was overheard saying ‘outrageous’ when this suggestion was put to her . husband. The inquiry heard how James Murdoch had met Mr Cameron a total of 14 times, 12 of them before he became Prime Minister. There were seven breakfasts, lunches . and dinners between June 2006 and May 2009 for what Mr Murdoch said were . the purposes of ‘general social conversation’, often with their wives . present. Mr Cameron dined at Mr Murdoch’s . London home in September 2009, nine days before The Sun switched . allegiance to the Tories, and on November 2 that year, James Murdoch and . Rebekah Brooks joined Mr Cameron for breakfast, to discuss ‘politics’. The two men have met only twice since . Mr Cameron became PM, once at the Christmas dinner and a lunch at . Chequers in November 2010. Mr Murdoch said he was ‘curious’ as to . Cameron’s views ‘on a variety of topics’ when he met him. Hacking probe: Rebekah Brooks, pictured with media mogul Rupert Murdoch, was first arrested under Operation Weeting last July . It also emerged that Tony and Cherie . Blair invited James Murdoch to Chequers for lunch when Labour were in . power, and he met Gordon Brown three times – all three at the request of . Mr Brown. Mr Murdoch told the inquiry yesterday . he was also ‘friendly’ with Mr Osborne and had visited the Chancellor’s . grace and favour house, Dorneywood in Buckinghamshire, with his family. David Cameron and News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie are at the heart of what has become known as the ‘Chipping Norton Set’. It is made up of powerful political and media figures who have homes in a tiny triangle in one of the most scenic parts of England – the Cotswolds. The group go to the same house parties, dine together and even ride together. Key players in the 'set' also include Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson and daughter of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, Elisabeth who is married to PR fixer Matthew Freud. They met socially until the phone hacking scandal erupted. He claimed he had a discussion with . the Chancellor about News Corp’s bid to take over BSkyB, which was . eventually dropped last July after a public outcry over the revelation . that the News of the World hacked murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s . phone. Mr Murdoch said his conversation about . the proposed buy-out of the satellite broadcaster with the Chancellor . ‘would have just been to be grumpy about it taking a long time and being . referred to (regulator) Ofcom, which I was very clear in public about . at the same time’. Last night Labour MP John Mann raised . questions about the response from the then Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus . O’Donnell – now Lord O’Donnell – to his questions last year about . conversations between the Prime Minister and Mr Murdoch regarding the . BSkyB bid. Last July, the MP was told that decisions ‘were at all times taken properly and in accordance with the relevant legislation’. Lord O’Donnell concluded: ‘The Prime . Minister was not the decision maker. Nor did he seek to influence the . decisions of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Jeremy . Hunt. ‘The fact that he had meetings with Rebekah Brooks and James Murdoch last year is a matter of public record. ‘The fact that the Prime Minister was . not the decision maker meant that he would not have had to consult me . before meeting them.’ But Mr Mann said: ‘The ex-Cabinet Secretary and Prime Minister both face critical questions that must be adequately answered. ‘Why was there no investigation . carried out last year into the Prime Minister’s dealings with James . Murdoch regarding the BSkyB bid?’ A Downing Street spokesman denied that . journalists had been misled last year, insisting it had been right to . say Mr Cameron had not been involved in formal discussions about BSkyB. These are the meetings James Murdoch held with senior British politicians disclosed by the Leveson Inquiry: . Meetings with David Cameron as leader of the opposition: .

"Should Lewis come out of retirement for $100m fight? Should Lewis come out of retirement for $100m fight? Now share your opinion . Lennox Lewis has told Russian promoters that he will come back to fight one of the Klitschko brothers for the biggest purse in boxing history. The 48-year-old, who is still the most recent undisputed world heavyweight champion, was offered $50million (£31.3m) in Moscow at the weekend while attending Wladimir Klitschko’s successful defence of his world titles against Alexander Povetkin. Lewis responded by promising to return to the ring for $100m (£62.6m). The promoters are considering doubling their bid and Lewis says: ‘That is my price tag and it is under discussion. I have told them I can be ready in six months and I am in provisional training.’ Scroll down for video . Comeback: Lennox Lewis has said he will fight one of the Klitschko brothers (below) for $100m . Brothers in arms: Wladimir (left) defended his titles on Saturday while Vitali has been concentrating on politics . Lewis, . in London to launch his new training academy for potential world . heavyweight champions, is running in Hyde Park each morning. He . reports himself to be ‘already well under 300lb’. He weighed around . 245lb in his prime. Lewis believes that in a fight next spring he can . surpass big George Foreman, who regained the title at the age of 48, as . the oldest world heavyweight  champion of all time. His price for coming out of retirement would give him the biggest pay-note in boxing history. Scores to settle: Lewis beat Vitali when the fight was stopped in the sixth round due to a serious cut . Upset: Klitschko was ahead on all three judges' scorecards when the fight - Lewis' last - was stopped . Floyd . Mayweather holds that record having been guaranteed $41.2million for . last month’s super fight with Mexico’s Canelo Alvarez, with his take . expected to rise to $70million once all the pay-per-view revenue is . accounted for. Lewis was talking in terms of $50million when he last considered a return to the ring. Now . he says: ‘I said at the time that it will take $50million to get me out . of my pyjamas but now I have to consider the value of my legacy of . having retired as undisputed champion. That will cost them $100million.’ Down and out: Wladimir Klitschko knocked Alexander Povetkin down four times en-route to victory . That . figure is clearly achievable in the modern boxing world. It is believed . that the Russians are projecting a rematch of the fabled battle between . Lewis and Vitali Klitschko in Los Angeles in 2003, which the Englishman . won on cuts and a year after which he announced his retirement without . having boxed again. The older of the Klitschko brothers, now 42, who . holds the WBC world title, has campaigned consistently for a return . bout. And if that were to become his last fight before retiring to seek . the presidency of his native Ukraine it would be worth an absolute . fortune. Lewis would prefer to fight Wladimir, 37, saying: ‘I beat . Vitali so I would like to fight the other brother but we’ll see how it . works out. I want to bring back the Sweet Science to heavyweight . boxing.’ Champion: Vitali is the reigning WBC belt holder, the only title his brother Wladimir does not hold . He was a more intent observer of . Wladmir’s than most imagined while watching from ringside the younger . Klitschko’s somewhat criticised victory over Povetkin. The possibility of facing the holder . of all the other heavyweight belts is on the mind of Lewis as he says: . ‘In a way this fight confirmed my disappointment with the state of . heavyweight boxing right now. The best I could find to challenge . Wladimir was a kid who is not fully developed either physically or in . terms of experience. ‘People . paid a lot of money in expectation of a great fight but Povetkin was . not properly prepared for the most important fight of his career. ‘Wladimir . should have gone for the knockout after putting him down four times but . I think he missed having [the late] Manny Steward in his corner. Manny . would have told him what he told me when I fought Vitali - to go in and . finish him. Break: Vitali has not fought for more than a year since he beat Manuel Charr last September (above) ‘I suspect . Wladimir had a problem with his right hand because as the fight went on . he didn’t use it that often. But having said that he showed great . movement, was very light on his feet and was never in danger of losing.’ Lewis is aware of how severe the . physical demands will be to come back at his age after 10 years out of . the ring. He used to dedicate himself before big fights by going into . seclusion in the hills of the Poconos, outside New York. Now . he says:  ‘I will go back to the mountains and into isolation. With the . Russians involved I am thinking of training in Siberia.’ Next big thing: Olympic champion Anthony Joshua . Anthony . Joshua has sought the advice of Lewis during his transition from . Olympic gold medallist at the London Games to his professional debut . victory last Saturday and Lewis, a former Olympic champion himself, . says: ‘Big Josh has the attributes to go all the way but we will have to . see how it works out in his first 10 paid fights. It’s not fair to . judge him before that.’ Clearly . Lewis is confident that he can beat all the younger pretenders, Tyson . Fury and David Haye included, to the richest crown in sport. As for the future, Lewis intends to be deeply involved. Youngsters of world heavyweight title potential are being invited to submit videos of themselves in action to a website which opens on Monday for registration: www.insearchofchampions.com . The most promising will then be offered a chance to train at one of three camps which Lewis is in the process of setting up in London, Canada and Jamaica. He says: ‘The training of heavyweights is a specialised business and we will help these young men in all aspects of it, training, management and promoting included.’ Lewis also believes that David Price, with whom he worked briefly before his upsetting rematch with Tony Thompson, can be brought back as a contender ‘as long as he gives me and my team enough time to do the job’. George Foreman — After a decade out of the ring, he returned aged 38 and fought for another 10 years. He regained the IBF and WBA world titles he’d lost to Muhammad Ali 20 years previously by beating Michael Moorer in 1994 (below). Evander Holyfield —  Quit in 1994 with a heart problem but returned after seeing a faith healer on TV. Last fought against Brian Nielsen in 2011. Riddick Bowe — Retired at 28 to join the US Marine Corps Reserve but quit three days into training and returned to the ring seven years later. His last fight was in 2008, when he was 41. Ricky Hatton — Quit after defeats by Floyd Mayweather in 2007 and Manny Pacquiao in 2009 but returned in 2012 to face Vyacheslav Senchenko, who stopped him in eight (below).

"Caught out: Charlie Fisher with Becky Connery this year . The three girlfriends of a cheating supermarket worker decided to humiliate him in public after realising he had slept with all of them within 24 hours. Becky Connery, Lizzie Leeland-Cunningham and a third girl, who does not wish to be named, confronted Charlie Fisher, 20, when they discovered he had been triple-timing them for months. The Mail reported earlier this week how they ambushed him at Luton Airport, shouting ‘cheat’ and ‘liar’, when he returned from a holiday in Germany. But Miss Connery, 17, a student from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, yesterday revealed how the trio hatched the plan after realising the extent of his deceit. She told MailOnline: ‘We are pretty sure that he slept with us all in one day, which is disgusting. I spoke to Lizzie and the other girl and we realised that Charlie had had sex with me one morning, then with Lizzie that afternoon, then the other one at her house the day after.’ ‘I don’t know why we did it. He was boring, and we all agreed he wasn’t great in bed.’ Mr Fisher, from Hatfield, was rumbled when A-level pupil Miss Connery, who was at his house the night before he went on holiday, picked up his phone and saw a message from a girl saying ‘I will meet you later’. It made her suspicious because, she said, he had asked her to go home early that night because he had to finish his packing. Scroll down for video . She explained: ‘He said, “She’s just a friend”, but the next day after he flew to Germany I found her on Twitter and messaged her. ‘We arranged to meet in a pub, and it turned out that she, like me, had had her suspicions. I’d been seeing him since March and she had been seeing him since January.’ They then met the other girl after contacting her on Facebook. ‘It turned out that she thought she was Charlie’s girlfriend, too. We couldn’t believe it,’ Miss Connery said. Becky Connery, 17, Lizzie Leeland-Cunningham, 19, and the third girl, 20, (L-R) all had relationships with him . Mr Fisher, pictured with Becky earlier this year, juggled excuses and pet names to avoid being rumbled .

"U.S. envoy Samantha Power demonstrated the new, safe way to greet people in Ebola-ravaged countries this week. It's known as the 'Ebola handshake', which involves touching the person you're greeting with your elbow. Ms Power, the U.S ambassador to the UN, touched elbows on Tuesday with Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf during a news conference in the city of Monrovia. Scroll down for video . Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, right, gives U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power what is know as the 'Ebola handshake' during a news conference in the city of  Monrovia on Tuesday . Ebola is not contagious until symptoms begin, and it takes close contact with bodily fluids to spread . Ebola is spread through direct contact (through broken skin or through your eyes, nose, or mouth) with Blood and body fluids (like urine, feces, saliva, vomit, sweat, and semen) of a person who is sick with Ebola, or objects (like needles) that have been contaminated with the blood or body fluids of a person sick with Ebola. Ms Power said . she will return from West Africa to the United States and the . United Nations on Thursday with a message of 'hope and . possibility' that the global response to the Ebola outbreak is . working, but more resources are needed. But she warned: 'This is a crisis that is so vast, with needs so great, with potential consequences so dire that no country can afford to stand on the sidelines. A few are doing a lot. But a lot are doing very little, or nothing at all.' Speaking to Reuters after visiting the three worst-affected . countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, Power said among . several areas to focus on was removing the stigma of the deadly . hemorrhagic disease in those countries and around the world. Ebola survivors in West Africa have been shunned, while . Australia has banned visas for citizens of the three countries . and several U.S. states have imposed a mandatory quarantine on . health care workers returning from the region. 'It is quite literally the most heartbreaking form of . ailment that any community could ever go through where you . cannot care for your loved ones,' Power said. 'The only thing . worse than losing a child is not being able to hold the child . that you're losing. It's mind-blowing.' She said recently established command and control centers in . the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone - bringing together the . governments, the United Nations, foreign countries taking a lead . in the response and aid groups - were proving successful. The coordination was 'a sight to behold,' said Power.

Source: cdc.gov/Includes AP text . In Freetown in Sierra Leone, the rate of safe burials of the . highly contagious bodies of Ebola victims had risen from 30 . percent to 98 percent in the few days a burial command center . had been in operation, while in Liberia a mobile laboratory in a . remote area had cut testing times from five days to five hours. 'It's a great privilege to be able to bring back that sense . of hope and possibility to the United States and to the U.N. Now . the message is, 'What we are doing is working,'' she said. 'What we have is not enough, but we know from our . interventions that they can have these pronounced speedy . effects. So now we can say you have opportunity to be a part of . a winning enterprise,' Power said of her bid to convince more . countries to join the response efforts. Power said it was important that command and control centers . were now in place in regional areas in all three countries. She said lessons could be learned and shared from the . responses in each country. In Guinea, the national response . center in Conakry was a couple of conference rooms with few . resources and U.N. officials were based elsewhere in the city. As hundreds of millions of dollars is spent on tackling the . outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday that . Liberia may be seeing a decline in the spread of the virus, . though the battle is far from won. 'Given the unpredictability of the epidemic, the risk of . having excess capacity on the ground and available is a risk . well worth taking,' Andy Weber, deputy head of the U.S. State . Department's Ebola Coordination Unit, told Reuters. 'We can't stop the work to get as many of the required ETUs . (Ebola Treatment Units) in place, to have them geographically . dispersed so they're accessible to as many potential patients as . possible,' said Weber, who traveled to West Africa with Power. Power will speak at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels on . Thursday. She says more countries need to step up to help fight . the disease that has killed 5,000 people mainly in Liberia, . Sierra Leone and Guinea since March, with a handful of cases in . Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, Spain and the United States. The epidemic remains at a scale and severity the world has . never seen before, said Power, who spoke with Reuters as she . traveled to Brussels from West Africa. 'It will be something people talk about generations from . now. There are these historical challenges that arise. Sometimes . it's the violence that one country commits against another, or . atrocities against civilians. It could be a tsunami. Here it is . the worst public health emergency in history,' she said.

"A man who lost five toes to diabetes while incarcerated at Arapahoe County jail has filed a lawsuit claiming the loss was due to lack of medical care. The lawsuit filed in federal court alleges that Correctional Healthcare Companies failed to properly provide medical treatment to James Neisler. The Denver Post reported on Saturday that Neisler suffered a broken blister on his right big toe from ill-fitting boots worn while he worked in the kitchen. He says medical staff ignored a serious injury for a diabetic and waited a month last summer before taking him to a hospital. Not treated soon enough: James Neisler, who lost five toes to diabetes while incarcerated at Arapahoe County jail, has filed a lawsuit claiming the loss was caused by a lack of medical care . Behind bars: Neisler was in jail awaiting resolution of misdemeanor domestic violence and drunken driving charges from a dispute at the burial of his dog Zoe, an Australian shepherd/malamute . He was in jail awaiting resolution of misdemeanor domestic violence and drunken driving charges. The domestic violence charge stemmed from a dispute at the burial of his dog Zoe, an Australian shepherd/malamute. In a response to the lawsuit, Correctional Healthcare Companies claims others outside its control, including Neisler, may have contributed to the injury. Company officials did not return a call seeking comment. Neisler first asked for help on July 20, 2013, according to the lawsuit. He was taken to the hospital on Aug. 22, 2013. 'My right big toe is bleeding, oozing and twice the size of my left big toe,' he wrote Aug. 12. Two days later, he wrote: ""my toe is literally rotting now and smells awful. ... I'm begging to be taken to a hospital or wound care clinic for it to be looked at ... please take me."" ""I knew it was going south quickly,"" he said of the experience. 'My big toe was like a piece of beef jerky. It was past gangrene, all the way to bone infection.' Diabetic: James Neisler suffers from diabetes and says that his broken blister caused by ill fitting boots while working in the jail kitchen was actually a very serious injury requiring immediate medical care . The infection had spread to his bone and doctors eventually removed all toes on his right foot to stem the infection. Neisler, a 47-year-old former financial adviser said he no longer plays hoops with a son who is a basketball player or run long distance like he used to do with his daughter, who runs cross country. 'I could write 25 country songs about what happened,' said Neisler, of his plight while incarcerated in the same jail that held Aurora theater shooting suspect James Holmes. 'I have to laugh, because otherwise I'd be crying all the time.' Limited: Neisler says he will no longer be able to play sports with his children now that he has lost all of the toes on his right foot due to 'not receiving timely medical care' 'I have to laugh, because otherwise I'd be crying all the time': Neisler is devastated after losing his toes and is suing Arapahoe County jail where he was incarcerated following a drunk driving and domestic violence charge .

Cowell tweeted just hours later, giving away the infant's name: 'Very happy to say Eric was born at 17.45pm. Healthy and handsome.' Adding an explanatory note: 'Named after my dad'. Happy man: The 54-year-old flashed a grin as he greeted someone on the street following the birth of his son . One last push, we mean puff:  Cowell, pictured taking a drag on his cigarette as he arrived at Lenox Hill hospital in Manhattan, has become a father for the first time . Daddy cool: Simon Cowell looked utterly delighted as he arrived at Lennox Hill Hospital in New York City on Friday amid the imminent arrival of his first born child .

'I can't lie, it was the worst day of my life,' Cowell said, 'a horrible horrible time.' He . also credited his father with giving him a unique ability to use his . charms to be able to reach out and connect with anybody regardless of . their background. 'He said . to me - because he was successful, my dad, when he ran his company - he . said, 'everybody around you has an invisible sign on their head which . says 'make me important', Cowell revealed. 'What . I understood from that is that you've got to recognise that everyone . around you wants to be recognised, wants to be appreciated. 'What . I try and remember is that when I make a show, everyone has played a . part in it. The show is created, truthfully, by 500 people every week.' There'll be no more of that: Simon Cowell steps out of his car in a puff of smoke as he arrives for the birth of his baby son today in New York . Earlier that afternoon, the music mogul was pictured taking one . final drag on his cigarette as he arrived in New York City with a huge . grin on his face while preparing for the imminent arrival of his baby . son.

Speaking to photographers outside the . hospital, the music millionaire, who missed the last day of taping . auditions for his show Britain's Got Talent, said his baby was due 'any . second now' and that Lauren is 'doing great'. Perhaps . to quell his nerves, Cowell took a puff on one of his favourite menthol . Kool cigarettes before heading into the hospital. It remains to be seen . whether he will exchange a Kool for a cigar to celebrate the baby's . birth. With a baby on the way, Cowell had declared that he was quitting smoking, but in November he admitted 'I lied.' Claiming electronic cigarettes ""don't work,""  the mogul said: 'There are a lot of boring things that happen when you have a baby . 'You have to get rid of] sharp edges, . cigarettes, alcohol … then there's [baby-proofing] the toilet. But I'll . have a smoking room!' Lauren, 37, said she wanted to have the . baby at home in Manhattan, where her mother could help out and so she . could be near her eldest son Adam. Her mother Carole Sandland is thought to be traveling from her home in Florida  to be on hand when the newborn arrives. Once their bundle of . joy is ready to leave hospital, the couple will bring him home to the . $26-000-a-month apartment they are renting in Manhattan. The . news has come as surprise to Simon as Lauren was due to give birth on . February 28 in one of Manhattan's most exclusive hospitals. Happy Valentine's Day!

'I probably will be nervous when it all happens. I am going to watch (movie) Father of the Bride tonight to get used to that. I have got a feeling my child is going to be really naughty.' Cowell is currently overseeing BGT auditions in London's Hammersmith with fellow judges Amanda Holden, comedian David Walliams and singer Alesha Dixon. The Britain's Got Talent boss revealed that expectant girlfriend Lauren has given him carte blanche to carry on with his hectic workload after the baby arrives. Doting: Simon had kept a plane on standby so he could get to Lauren in Manhattan as quickly as possible . A squeamish Cowell revealed this week: 'I haven't changed a nappy before and I won't. I just can't do it. I'd like to be at the birth but a little but far away.' The pop supremo, who notoriously doesn't wake before midday, maintains Lauren is understanding of his workload and has vowed not to make demands of him. 'Lauren knows what my work schedule is like and everything else so she's cool with that.' In the lurch: David Walliams, Alesha Dixon and Amanda Holden will be forced to continue without him . Missing link: Simon was absent from proceedings as his Britain's Got Talent co-judges (L-R) Alesha Dixon, David Walliams and Amanda Holden arrived at auditions in London on Friday . Last month the MailOnline revealed that Simon and Lauren had decided to call their son Simon Cowell Junior  However, today, a close source said: 'They're 50/50 right now, so we have to wait and see.' Although many thought Cowell was joking when he said that Simon was his favourite name, a friend of the couple said: ‘Simon and Lauren have decided that their favorite name for the baby is actually Simon.' ‘For a while it was between Simon and Eric- Simon’s dad’s name, but now it looks like Eric will be the middle name.’ Blooming: A heavily pregnant Silverman was last seen with 54-year-old Cowell on January 9 in St Barts . Indeed, at Lauren’s baby shower, guests brought baby gifts emblazoned with the name Simon on them. Including gifts embroidered with the initials SC. Meanwhile Ladbrokes have released the odds for the name of the baby and they make it just a 2/1 shot that his son is called Eric after his late father. Simon Junior is next in the betting at 4/1 or it's a 6/1 shot Harry or George get the nod, but it seems highly unlikely that Louis, Gary or Piers will be the chosen name at 33/1. The odds also suggest that Andrew is out of the running at 100/1 considering it's the name of Lauren's ex-husband.

"Surrounded by barbed wire, sandbags and mud, this 60ft trench is barely distinguishable from those occupied by British soldiers fighting in the First World War almost a century ago. The enormous dugout has been painstakingly recreated by an ex-history teacher in his back garden in Surrey, and the dedicated 55-year-old even spent 24 hours living in its confines with a team of volunteers as part of his efforts to experience life as a WWI soldier. Andrew Robertshaw and 30 helpers spent a month shifting around 200 tonnes of earth to build the enormous three-room trench, which he hopes will teach people more about the horrific living conditions endured by British troops during the Great War. Scroll down for video . Endurance: Former history teacher Andrew Robertshaw built the trench to highlight the plight of WWI soldiers . The father-of-one has even spent 24 hours living in the hole - which features a kitchen, infantry room, and officers' dugout - as part of an overnight re-enactment of trench warfare in the garden in Charlwood. Mr Robertshaw - who acted as a military advisor on the Steven Spielberg epic War Horse - and a band of volunteers dressed up in replica uniforms and used rifles to fire blanks into the countryside during their stint in the trench. 'My grandfather fought in the war and was wounded three times,' said the historian, who also runs the Royal Logistics Corps Museum in Deepcut, Surrey. 'I wanted to show people that the war was about survival and not just about death. When the soldiers weren't fighting this is how they were living. 'The most common experience was living in a trench and trying to be as comfortable as possible while living in a hole in the ground,' he added. Replica: Mr Robertshaw enlisted the help of volunteers and soldiers from the 23 Pioneer Regiment Royal Logistics Corps for the ambitious project . Living conditions: Mr Robertshaw and volunteers spent 24 hours living in the trench and re-enacting warfare . Legacy: The historian said that, with Remembrance Day approaching, it was particularly important to reflect on what British troops endured . Mr Robertshaw, whose grandfather fought in the war, said he wanted to show how soldiers lived when they weren't fighting . With Remembrance Day approaching, Mr . Robertshaw said it was particularly important to reflect on the living . conditions endured by British troops. 'Many people will know someone who was involved in the war and it is a direct legacy to the world today,' he said. Mr Robertshaw and his band of . volunteers - which included soldiers from the 23 Pioneer Regiment Royal . Logistics Corps - got a glimpse into the life of a Tommy when they spent . 24 hours living in the trench and kept a diary of the experience. 'It's all about learning,' said Mr . Robertshaw, who explained that all of the participants wrote about their . experiences of cooking, eating and cleaning in the trench. ‘I . am an ex-history teacher and I just want people to know more about our . history and the First World War is such a big part of that,' said the . historian, who has appeared on the television programme Time Team and . worked behind the scenes on Who Do You Think You Are? ‘Particularly as Remembrance Day is coming up it is important to realise how those troops were living.' The former teacher is in the process of creating a video for use is schools, which will explore the trench and include footage of some of his First World War re-enactments. Mr Robertshaw is also hoping to launch a website through which schoolchildren can virtually explore the dugout. The historian, who has opened the trench to the public in the past, said: 'I usually target war enthusiasts and societies like the Western Front Association, as it will mean more to them,' he said. 'I have just made a tester video for schools to use when teaching about the war and I have had an idea to make the trench available via the web.' Mr Robertshaw said such a website would help bring history to life for youngsters watching. ‘A website for the trench could be used by schools to give lectures which are much more realistic then looking at a black and white photograph, which is what we have at the moment,' he said. Photographs of Mr Robertshaw's 24-hour stint in the trench are also included in his . book, entitled 24 Hour Trench: A Day In The Life Of a Frontline Tommy, which is set in April 1917. Warfare: Mr Robertshaw captured the 24-hour stint in the trench on camera for a book he wrote . Re-enactment: Mr Robertshaw and volunteers donned replica uniforms and spent 24 hours living in the trench . Realistic: The 'troops' used rifles to fire blanks in the Surrey countryside as part of the re-enactment . While the sprawling trench is . overlooked by a number of other houses in Charlwood, Mr Robertshaw said . he had received no complaints from neighbours and some even made cups of . tea for the 'troops' during the overnight battle re-enactment. Since building the dugout last summer . Mr Robertshaw has sold his Surrey house and moved, but eager to hold on . to the results of his ambitious project, he has retained ownership of the land housing the trench. Steven Andrews, 63, who lives next to the trench in Charlwood, told how he hears the sound of gunfire emerging from the dugout when re-enactments are taking place. 'My land borders Andy's land but we have never had any real problems,' he said. 'The only issue I have ever raised is that I have horses and when the re-enactments are going on they can get easily spooked. 'Last time we came to an agreement that Andy would stop shooting at certain times when the horses were out. 'We can hear the gunfire from the house, he uses real rifles used in WWI, but as it isn't very often we don't mind,' Mr Andrews said. Mr Robertshaw's latest book, 24 Hours In Battle, is due to be released next year. Images of the re-enactment are taken from the book 24hr Trench: A Day in the Life of a Frontline Tommy by Andrew Robertshaw, published by The History Press, www.thehistorypress.co.uk.

"A pair of experimental Ebola vaccines that protect monkeys from  the fatal disease ravaging West Africa have been developed.

The findings offer a glimpse of which - if any - of the . Ebola vaccines in development will prove effective, and in what . form. Pharmaceutical firms are accelerating their efforts to provide . Ebola vaccines and treatments as the worst known outbreak of the . virus tears through West Africa, killing more than 2,000 people. Scroll down for video . Hope? A pair of experimental Ebola vaccines that protect monkeys from the disease ravaging West Africa have been developed. Pictured, workers  stand in the contaminated area at the Elwa hospital  in Monrovia yesterday . The worst known outbreak of the Ebola virus has ravaged West Africa, killing more than 2,000 people. The results of the new study suggest, for instance, that a . vaccine by pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) now being tested on healthy volunteers will protect . against Ebola infection in the short term, but may have to be . augmented for long-term protection. The study, published in Nature Medicine, is the first to . report that a vaccine regimen produced 'durable immunity' against Ebola, protecting four out of four monkeys for 10 . months. The vaccine uses a chimp adenovirus, closely related to a . human version that causes upper respiratory tract infections, . into which scientists spliced an Ebola gene. The adenovirus infects cells in a vaccinated animal, causing . them to take up the gene and produce Ebola proteins. That primes . the immune system to attack the proteins of Ebola viruses when . an infection occurs. Race for life: A vaccine candidate, in a vial, that will be used in the upcoming  human Ebola trials. Right, A health worker with a potentially contaminated patient on at Elwa hospital in Monrovia . The vaccine in the study is similar to competing vaccines . being developed by GSK, which began human safety trials last . Tuesday, and by Johnson & Johnson (J&J), which aims to start safety trials in early . 2015. A third experimental Ebola vaccine uses a different delivery . system, a livestock pathogen called vesicular stomatitis virus . (VSV). A version developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada . and licensed to NewLink Genetics is scheduled to be . tested for safety in healthy volunteers this fall. Profectus . BioSciences is also developing a VSV vaccine. In the new study, led by Nancy Sullivan of the National . Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), . researchers sought to see whether a double dose of vaccine in a . regimen called 'prime-boost' would address two different . clinical needs. Health workers carry the body of a man, right, suspected of dying from the Ebola virus and left in the street, in the capital city of Monrovia, Liberia, last month . One is protecting against Ebola immediately, said NIAID . director Dr Anthony Fauci, as when a person is heading to an . area with an Ebola outbreak. In the study, an adenovirus vaccine . essentially the same as GSK's does so: four of four vaccinated . macaque monkeys given otherwise lethal doses of Ebola five weeks . later survived and had no detectable virus in their blood.

"Britain's fish-eating habits will have to change due to warmer sea temperatures which is resulting in the disappearance of fish stocks from our coastal waters including cod. Experts have warned that people will have to start eating different fish like hake, red mullet and anchovies which are rising in numbers along Britain's coasts. According to scientists the seas around the UK have risen in temperature by about 1.6C since 1980. Sustainable: Experts are encouraging people to try different alternatives to cod like the red gurnard (pictured) Oceanographer Professor Callum Roberts from York University said that over the past 35 years, 15 of 36 species analysed have moved 300km north. Fish which live in colder waters have moved north towards Iceland while fish like the John Dory which used to be found near south-west England can now be found as north as Scotland. Professor Stephen Simpson of Exeter University said the UK relies too heavily on the 'big five' - cod, haddock, tuna, prawns and salmon. However, fishermen are catching fish like gurnard, sea bass, John Dory and hake but there is no market for them in the UK. Popular: Experts say the UK relies too heavily on the big five varieties of fish which include cod . Professor Stephen Simpson of Exeter said: 'We have had a milder winter and warmer fish are moving north. 'Whatever the reason we have seen waters become warmer within the last 30 years. 'More exotic species are starting to show up in waters around the UK while the colder water fish are retreating further north. It is a bit like the changing of the guard. But we too have to adapt. 'Our grandparents enjoyed cod and haddock and it is a cultural thing that we like to eat those types of fish. But 70 per cent of our cod is now imported to the UK. 'We are buying fish like cod and haddock but then selling the fish we have around our shores to France, Spain and Portugal. 'It's time to be a bit more adventurous and adapt our diet because the fish is moving.' Sustainable fishing aims to ensure there will be populations of ocean and freshwater wildlife for the future. Demand for seafood and advances in technology have led to fishing practices that are depleting fish and shellfish populations around the world. Fishers remove more than 77 billion kilograms (170 billion pounds) of wildlife from the sea each year. Scientists fear that continuing to fish at this rate may soon result in a collapse of the world’s fisheries. In order to continue relying on the ocean as an important food source, economists and conservationists say we will need to employ sustainable fishing practices. Fish like the John Dory which used to be found near south-west England can now be found as north as Scotland . The well-established Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification is used for wild fish. Their blue tick label indicates that a fish comes from sustainable waters, is not over-exploited and is not endangered. A new report published this month by the Marine Conservation Society detailed how the ecosystem of the English Channel has been transformed by fishing and those at the top of the food chain are fairing badly. The report's authors say that this is evidence of 'fishing down the food chain'. 'We really need governments to take on board the urgent need to better protect our seas' Dr Jean-Luc Solandt . Since the 1940s, commonly-landed fish like spurdog, cod, and ling have come to be replaced in fishermens' nets by fish such as small spotted catsharks, and shellfish such as scallops, crabs and lobster. The authors recommend a network of fisheries closures to help get the ecosystem back on the path to recovery. Dr Jean-Luc Solandt, MCS senior biodiversity policy officer, said: 'This report adds evidence to what we have known for a number of years now - that the huge efforts of fishing boats from many nations are continuing to fish down the food chain in the English Channel - and elsewhere. 'We really need governments to take on board the urgent need to better protect our seas.' Dr Solandt added: 'There isn't one square kilometre of the English Channel that is protected from all forms of fishing. 'Recently the government has applied pressure to stop destructive fishing in protected areas where reefs exist in the English Channel. Royal Mail has also joined the campaign to highlight sustainable fishing by releasing these stamps . 'This demonstrates that recovery is possible if areas are closed to damaging fishing gear.' Royal Mail has also joined the campaign to highlight sustainable fishing.

In June the Royal Mail issued a set of UK stamps featuring five species threatened in UK waters and five that come from sustainable populations. A survey, commissioned by Royal Mail to coincide with the stamp launch, revealed 99 per cent of the people questioned had heard the term 'sustainable fishing' but more than half felt they knew little or nothing about it. Eighty-four per cent of people who took part in the survey said there wasn't enough information about sustainability when buying or ordering fish, whilst 66 per cent said they would buy or order more if they were assured of the sustainability of fishing methods or farming. Professor of Marine Conservation at York University, Callum Roberts, acted as a consultant for the stamp launch and said Marine Protected Areas that are off limits to fishing could recover endangered species like those on the stamps. The fish that feature on the stamps which are threatened include the common skate, spiny dogfish, sturgeon and wolfish. Fish considered as sustainable include the dab, red gurnard, herring and pouting.

"Her sexy wardrobe (and racy reputation) have earned her the nickname ‘Gucci Helle’ in her native Denmark. It’s the kind of profile you would normally associate with, say, a footballer’s wife, or a model, not a prime minister. But then Danish leader Helle Thorning-Schmidt, 46, who dragged Barack Obama and David Cameron into that embarrassing ‘selfie’, is not a typical head of state, not by British standards anyway. Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, pictured with her husband Stephen Kinnock  last year . How many premiers, for example, when heckled at a public meeting about their wardrobe would have replied bluntly: ‘We can’t all look like s***.’ Or boarded a military plane to wartorn Libya in camouflage jacket and stilettos, with a bright red Gucci handbag (the headline in one Danish newspaper screamed: ‘Helle Took Her Bag To War’). Not surprisingly, her sex appeal, which Miss Thorning-Schmidt seems to have exploited to the full, almost certainly contributed to her electoral success back in 2011. The word most Googled next to her name during the election campaign, it would later emerge, was ‘naked’. It is not clear, however, if voters expected to find naked photographs of her on the internet – or simply hoped to. Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Stephen, son of the former leader of the British Labour Party Neil Kinnock, have two daughters together and have been married since 1996 . Danish magazines, meanwhile, claim  her looks have been enhanced by Botox. (‘Helle Thorning: Obsessed with Botox – see revealing images of the Prime Minister inside’). Indeed, her career reads like a script from Borgen, the cult Danish political drama screened on BBC Four and featuring fictional prime minister Birgitte Nyborg. Miss Thorning-Schmidt has often compared herself to her TV counterpart. Certainly, her time in office has been dogged by scandal and gossip about her personal life. We have a particular interest in Miss . Thorning-Schmidt here in Britain, of course, because she is married to . former Labour leader Lord Kinnock’s son, Stephen, 42. Their domestic . arrangements are unusual, and the source of some controversy. Stephen Kinnock was a director of the World Economic Forum until 2012 and used to live in Davos, Switzerland, spending no more than 33 weekends in Denmark, apparently. Under Danish law, his non-resident status allowed his wife to deduct about £40,000 in tax from the mortgage repayments on their £500,000 house in Copenhagen. Pulling faces: Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt meets her British counterpart shortly after taking office in 2011 . But in a recent application to make him co-owner of the family home, Miss Thorning-Schmidt claimed her husband was there ‘every weekend of the year’. When challenged she was forced to admit she had made ‘sloppy mistakes’ in filing out her tax returns and her husband was non-resident. Danish tax authorities later exonerated the couple. But there was further embarrassment. Their . marriage became the subject of intense speculation in the Danish press, . with one newspaper raising questions over Mr Kinnock’s sexuality. Confronted with the allegations, Miss Thorning-Schmidt was forced to . publicly deny Mr Kinnock was gay. ‘I can only say it’s not true,’ she . declared. ‘It’s so grotesque. It is unpleasant to hear people talk about us like that.’ What was the source of these rumours – apart, that is, from the fact the couple were leading very separate lives? Miss Thorning-Schmidt has often compared herself to her TV counterpart, fictional prime minister Birgitte Nyborg (right, played by Sidse Babett Knudsen) on the cult Danish political drama Borgen . It was this: their accountant had told the tax officials that Mr Stephen Kinnock was ‘bisexual or gay’ to explain why he did not spend time in Denmark, and was not, therefore, liable for unpaid taxes. But details of this confidential meeting – and the accountant’s claims – were leaked to the press. ‘I admit it that I said it,’ the accountant, Frode Holm, said when he was contacted by journalists. ‘It was a mistake that I am still quite uneasy about today.’ The couple met in their twenties while working in Brussels and married in a civil ceremony in 1996. At . the time, Stephen’s parents were establishing themselves as the gilded . couple of the EU. Neil Kinnock was then a European Commissioner and wife . Glenys was Euro MP for South Wales East. ‘They are very clever, caring  people,’ said Miss Thorning-Schmidt. ‘We spend a lot of time with them in Brussels.’ Apparently, they send the glamorous Helle joke text messages whenever Borgen is on the TV. From the very beginning, though, Miss Thorning-Schmidt’s appearance, not just her political credentials, dominated the headlines. She became the country’s first woman prime minister on October 3, 2011. But it was not long before stories emerged of her expensive tastes. One of her handbags from the luxury British label Mulberry cost between £6,000 and £9,000. Another favourite brand was the exclusive Danish fashion house Winchmann Couture. Helle Thorning-Schmidt seems to revel in the attention – if it wins her votes. And, especially, it seems, admiring glances from flirtatious male statesmen.","Helle Thorning-Schmidt, 46, is an unconventional head of state .

"The Mars rover Curiosity has completed its first chemical test of soil from the red planet, and scientists say there are no surprises so far. The spacecraft is on a mission to look for ingredients in Martian soil and rocks that could support life. But in the first scoop of soil analyzed, there were no definitive signs of the chemical building blocks of life. The scoops taken by Curiosity in Gale Crater . 'We have no definitive detection of . Martian organics at this point, but we will keep looking in the diverse . environments of Gale Crater,' said SAM Principal Investigator Paul . Mahaffy of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Instead, the six-wheel rover detected water and a mix of other chemicals. The findings were reported at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco. A comment by mission's chief scientist two weeks ago led to speculation . that Curiosity had dug up carbon-based organics, considered an essential . ingredient for life. The Curiosity rover's instruments . have found signs of organic compounds on Mars - but Nasa has refused to . confirm they were not taken there by the rover. 'You have to be careful about what you say and how you say it,' said Nasa's John Grotzinger. 'The enthusiasm we had was just misunderstood,' he admitted. 'We're doing science at the speed of science in a world that goes at the speed of Instagrams.' A closeup of the martian soil sent back by the rover . The finding comes as NASA's Mars . Curiosity rover has used its full array of instruments to analyze . Martian soil for the first time, and found a complex chemistry within . the Martian soil. Water . and sulfur and chlorine-containing substances, among other ingredients, . showed up in samples Curiosity's arm delivered to an analytical . laboratory inside the rover. The sample came from a drift of windblown dust and sand called 'Rocknest.' The site lies in a relatively flat . part of Gale Crater still miles away from the rover's main destination . on the slope of a mountain called Mount Sharp. The rover's laboratory includes the . Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) suite and the Chemistry and Mineralogy . (CheMin) instrument. SAM used three methods to analyze gases given off . from the dusty sand when it was heated in a tiny oven. One class of substances SAM checks for is organic compounds -- carbon-containing chemicals that can be ingredients for life. SAM tentatively identified the oxygen . and chlorine compound perchlorate, a reactive chemical previously found . in arctic Martian soil by NASA's Phoenix Lander. Reactions with other chemicals heated . in SAM formed chlorinated methane compounds -- one-carbon organics that . were detected by the instrument. The chlorine is of Martian origin, but . it is possible the carbon may be of Earth origin, carried by Curiosity . and detected by SAM's high sensitivity design. The five scoops taken by Curiosity and analysed by the rover . Curiosity's team selected Rocknest as the first scooping site because it has fine sand particles suited for scrubbing interior surfaces of the arm's sample-handling chambers. Sand was vibrated inside the chambers to remove residue from Earth. MAHLI close-up images of Rocknest show a dust-coated crust one or two sand grains thick, covering dark, finer sand. 'Active drifts on Mars look darker on the surface,' said MAHLI Principal Investigator Ken Edgett, of Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego. 'This is an older drift that has had time to be inactive, letting the crust form and dust accumulate on it.' CheMin's examination of Rocknest samples found the composition is about half common volcanic minerals and half non-crystalline materials such as glass. 'We used almost every part of our science payload examining this drift,' said Curiosity Project Scientist John Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. 'The synergies of the instruments and richness of the data sets give us great promise for using them at the mission's main science destination on Mount Sharp.'

"The teenager suffering from a rare genetic condition turning her into a 'human mannequin' has spoken out about how she refuses to be beaten by her disease. Louise Wedderburn has a rare genetic condition which causes each of her joints to lock as the muscle turns into bone. The 19-year-old was born with Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a genetic disease which causes soft tissue to turn into bone, freezing her body permanently into place. Scroll down for video . Louise Wedderburn was born with FOP, a rare genetic disease that  causes soft tissue to turn into bone, freezing her body permanently into place . There have been just 700 confirmed cases of the rare disease worldwide and only 45 in the UK. With no known cure, the life expectancy of those with FOP is just 41. It could only be a matter of years before Miss Wedderburn is frozen in an upright position, needing a standing wheelchair to get around. But the teenager, from Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire, told ITV's This Morning: 'It’s never going to stop me from doing what I want to do.' She already defied the odds to attend her school prom despite being home-schooled for the majority of her education, and has now taken the first steps in a fashion career, doing work experience at London Fashion Week then at Elle magazine. With no known cure, the life expectancy of those with FOP is just 41. It could only be a matter of years before Miss Wedderburn is frozen in an upright position. Right: Appearing in a Channel 4 documentary aired tonight . She told ITV'S This Morning: 'No one has ever treated me any differently and my friends and family are a good support system' Miss Wedderburn’s story has been captured in Channel 4 documentary The Human Mannequin, to be aired tonight. 'I wanted to raise awareness of FOP,' Miss Wedderburn said. 'Obviously in our community everybody knows about it because of me, but it’s not as well known as some other conditions.' With fibrodysplasia . ossificans progressiva (FOP), bone begins to form in a person's muscles, tendons, ligaments and other connective tissues. Bone also forms over joints, which become literally ‘frozen' in place. Over time movement becomes more and more restricted. FOP is usually caused by a genetic mutation (change) that happens by chance. The . first sign that a child might have FOP syndrome are two malformed big toes, usually visible at birth. FOP bone . growth tends to go from the top down, starting in the neck and . finishing in the feet.  A child will typically develop bones in their . neck, then on their shoulders and arms, in the chest area, and finally . their feet. Unfortunately, . there is nothing that can   slow or stop the bone formation once it has started. SOURCE: Great Ormond Street Hospital . Diagnosed at the age of three, it was when she hit puberty that the condition took hold. Both her arms are locked in place and her spine is frozen. She told ITV's This Morning: 'I was walking along the road when I was three years old and fell. It was initially thought I'd dislocated my elbow, but it turned out I had FOP. 'But no one has ever treated me any differently and my friends and family are a good support system.' But the 19-year-old’s illness has not . affected her passion for fashion - she buys all the newest products and . spends hours practicing techniques and styles, as well as filling her . wardrobe with the latest fashions. 'My mum and granny were always well dressed. My mum used to dress us up in the biggest, frilliest dresses ever, and having older sisters I was always into clothes,' the 19-year-old said. 'I just love all of that. I would love to either be a stylist or a make-up artist or work for someone like Elle.' She told This Morning: 'I just love fashion and how you can adapt different trends to suit your own body shape. It makes me happy wearing really beautiful clothes.' And she got her dream come true, securing work experience placements at London Fashion Week and Elle magazine, both recorded in the documentary. The experiences were came with their own challenges - Miss Wedderburn has to be accompanied at all times because of her limited mobility and also has to be careful in crowded places, as any bump could cause her body to lay down more excess bone, locking another joint. Diagnosed at the age of three, it was when Louise hit puberty that the condition took hold. Both her arms are locked in place and her spine is frozen. Right: aged 12 with her mother Ciona . But she refused to be put off, saying: 'If I start to think about things I would never leave the house.' Sister . Samantha, 21, accompanied her to fashion week where she joined designer . Nadine Merabi, helping at hair and make-up trials then checking models’ hair, make-up and clothes before they hit the catwalk. At her placement at Elle, her mother Ciona, 44, also had to be on hand to help with practicalities like sitting comfortably at her desk. Miss Wedderburn admitted the latter was easier for her because of the chaotic nature of being backstage at fashion week. And she said she had been met with a positive reaction from everyone - which is not always the case. 'People have all sorts of different reactions,' she said. 'For some people it can take a lot for them to understand. You have to sit and explain it. 'But all my close family and friends are just like, ""you’re normal, get on with it"". There’s never been, ""you’re different, you can’t do this, you can’t do that"".' She often sticks to the mantra: 'if it doesn’t bother me it shouldn’t bother you', and is adamant that FOP will not stand in her way. Despite her condition, the teenager, from Aberdeenshire, insists: 'It's never going to stop me from doing what I want to do' 'If I think it’s fine and I can manage to do it, I will do it,' she added. Miss . Wedderburn now plans to pursue her career however she can from home, . including a fashion blog and her own styling and make-up business. There are also hopes for a cure for FOP after research scientists recently managed to stop it progressing in mice. 'The last time I heard, any cure could be about three to five years off,' Miss Wedderburn added. 'Of course I’m hopeful but I don’t get all excited and think it’s going to happen, because they could say three to five years but it could be longer.' But she refuses to fear the future - either the possibility of not living past her 40s, or being locked into one position. 'It doesn’t actually scare me because I don’t think about it. If it happens, it happens, and if they find a cure then that will be amazing.'

"Norwegian-Somali Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow sits on a rock during a school outing in Larvik, Norway. The picture was taken six years before the mall shootings he is thought to have taken part in . Suspected Kenyan mall terrorist Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow has been revealed as a Chelsea fan as pictures his life begin to emerge. The . Somali-born 23-year-old, who lived in Norway, was identified by a . neighbour two days ago who saw CCTV images of him carrying out the . atrocity. The report is now being investigated along with . suggestions the Dhuhulow left his home in Larvik, 75 miles south of . Oslo, for Somalia in 2009 where he was radicalised by the militant . group, al-Shabab. Dhuhulow is believed to have links to Mohamed . Abdikadir Mohamed, known as Ikrima, who is regarded as one of the most . dangerous commanders in the Somali terror group. Former neighbour Morten Henriksen told BBC's Newsnight that one of the attackers on the video clip, in a black shirt or jacket, . could be Dhuhulow, whom he described to the programme as 'pretty . extreme'. In total at least 67 people died in the September siege and it remains unclear how many militants were involved. A former classmate of Dhuhulow's at Thor Heyerdahl High School said she was shocked when she found out he was a suspect in the Nairobi attack. 'The video I saw looks a lot like him. But it's difficult to see,' said the former classmate, who didn't want her name to be used. 'He was a quiet guy,' she said. 'He was very committed to his religion, but not extreme. He brought a prayer mat to school.' Scroll down for videos . Dhuhulow is being . investigated over the attack on Kenya's Westgate shopping centre last . month - a relative said he could be the one dressed in a black shirt or . jacket . Brainwashed: According to one of his relatives who watched CCTV footage of shooting he may 'have been brainwashed' Larvik is a coastal town of about . 40,000, tucked in between the woods and the sea, surrounded by . agricultural land and close to the mountains. Community leader Mohamed Hassan said that Dhuhulow, as a boy, would listen to his elders in the mosque and be respectful. Yesterday it was revealed that two charred bodies pulled from the building in . Nairobi 'highly likely' to be attackers, a Kenyan MP told the BBC. Ndung'u . Gethenji, chairman of the parliamentary committee investigating the . attack, also said the body of a Kenyan soldier had been recovered. Mohamed Abdikadir Mohamed, known as . Ikrima in Kenya, is regarded as one of the most dangerous commanders in . the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab and is believed to have spent some . time in Norway. He is thought to have been a target of a SEAL raid earlier this month, although he managed to escape. Last . week, Norway's intelligence agency, the PST, said it had sent officers . to Kenya to verify reports that a Norwegian citizen was involved in the . attack on the Nairobi mall.

The Somali Islamic group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the assault and said it was in retaliation for Kenya sending troops into neighboring Somalia. The killers, who were dressed in Western clothes, ordered all Muslims to leave, before carrying out rudimentary tests to see if hostages could recite the Koran and name the mother of the Prophet Mohammed. Witnesses told how terrorists with faces hidden by Islamic scarves stormed the building, tossing grenades and spraying shoppers with AK-47s. At one point Kenyan authorities said a woman might have been involved in the attack, prompting speculation that British terrorist suspect Samantha Lewthwaite - who was married to July 7 bomber Jermaine Lindsay - might have had some connection with the attack. Dubbed the 'White Widow', Lewthwaite is known to be in East Africa and is wanted over alleged links to a terrorist cell that planned to bomb the country's coastal resorts.

"A fireman paralysed from the waist down after his spinal cord was completely severed has regained the ability to walk thanks to British scientists. Darek Fidyka, 40, is believed to be the first person in the world to recover from such chronic injuries, in an achievement hailed as more impressive than putting a man on the Moon. Mr Fidyka’s spinal cord was sliced in half during a stabbing four years ago, leaving him paralysed below the waist. Scroll down for video . Darek Fidyka has been able to walk again after receiving pioneering treatment which has repaired his severed spine. He is believed to be the first person in the world to recover from such chronic injuries . Amazingly, the Polish patient has now been able to resume an independent life – walking with a frame – thanks to a revolutionary technique pioneered at Wroclaw Medical University, Poland, and University College London. Mr Fidyka suffered damage similar to that of actor Christopher Reeve, whose spine was severed from his skull after he fell off a horse in 1995. While some victims of partial spinal injury have recovered, a complete break was generally assumed to be irreparable. However, scientists in Poland used cells from Mr Fidyka’s brain cavity to re-grow nerve cells which were then inserted into his spine, fixing the broken link. This graphic shows the steps making up the procedure, which allowed Mr Fidyka to walk again. Scientists transplanted olffactory ensheathing cells into the damaged part of the spinal chord, to grown new nerve cells . It is the first time the procedure has been shown to work on a human. Professor Geoffrey Raisman of UCL said: ‘We believe that this procedure is the breakthrough which, as it is further developed, will result in a historic change in the currently hopeless outlook for people disabled by spinal cord injury.’ He described Mr Fidyka’s recovery as ‘more impressive than man walking on the Moon’. The research, funded by the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation and UK Stem Cell Foundation, will be featured in a Panorama programme on BBC 1 tonight. The 40-year-old fireman from Poland was paralysed from the waist down after being stabbed four years ago . Scientists from Wroclaw Medical university in Poland and the University College London (UCL) pioneered the breakthrough procedure. It was designed to enable Darek Fidyka to walk again, after his spinal cord was sliced in half during a stabbing four years ago, leaving him paralysed below the waist. The procedure involved transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells – or OECs – from the olfactory bulb in the brain cavity to the spinal cord. OECs assist the repair of damaged nerves in the nose that transmit smell messages to the brain. The cells were transplanted into the  spinal cord, using 100 micro injections across the site of the injury. A small piece of nerve tissue, which was taken from the ankle, was grafted onto the 'gap' in the spinal cord to act as a scaffold for the spinal neurons to extend, as guided by the OECs. This enabled the ends of severed nerve fibres to grow and join together – something that was previously thought to be impossible. Three months after the operation, Mr Fidyka began to gain muscle in his left leg and regained sensations in it,  such as hot and cold, and pins and needes. A year later, he is able to walk again, with the aid of parallel bars. The procedure involved transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells – or OECs – from the olfactory bulb in the brain cavity to the spinal cord where they allowed nerve cells to regrow and bridge the 'gap' in the severed spinal cord . Professor Geoffrey Raisman (pictured) at UCL's Institute of Neurology performed the pioneering procedure. He said: ‘We believe that this procedure is the breakthrough which, as it is further developed, will result in a historic change in the currently hopeless outlook for people disabled by spinal cord injury’ Professor Raisman, whose work is also published in the journal Cell Transplantation today, said: ‘[Mr Fidyka] can get around with a walker and he’s been able to resume much of his original life, including driving a car. 'He’s not dancing, but he’s absolutely delighted.’ He continued: ‘The number of patients who are completely paralysed is enormous. 'There are millions of them in the world. If we can convince the global neurosurgeon community that this works then it will develop very rapidly indeed.’ Dr Pawel Tabakow, of the Wroclaw Medical University, said: ‘We estimated that without this treatment, our patient’s recovery chances were less than one per cent. 'However, we observed a gradual recovery of both sensory and motor function that began four months after the surgery.’ The procedure involved transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells – or OECs – from the olfactory bulb in the brain cavity to the spinal cord. OECs assist the repair of damaged nerves in the nose that transmit smell messages to the brain. Two weeks later, the cells were transplanted into the spinal cord, using 100 micro injections across the site of the injury. A small piece of nerve tissue, which was taken from the ankle, was grafted onto the spinal cord to act as a scaffold for the spinal neurons to extend, as guided by the OECs. This enabled the ends of severed nerve fibres to grow and join together across the 'gap' – something that was previously thought to be impossible. Three months after the operation, Mr Fidyka began to gain muscle in his left leg and regain sensation in parts of his lower body. He felt hot and cold as well as pins and needles in the limb. A year after surgery - and large amounts of physiotherapy at the rehabilitation centre in Wroclaw - he could walk with the aid of parallel bars and using a walker with short callipers supporting his ankles. Professor Raisman said: ‘The observed wisdom is that the central nervous system cannot regenerate damaged connections. I’ve never believed that.’ He stressed that what had been achieved was a leap forward beyond ‘plasticity’ – the re-wiring of the remaining connections. He compared that method to motorists finding other routes around a closed section of motorway, adding: ‘What we’re doing is repairing the motorway.’ Speaking on BBC Radio Four's Today Programme, Professor Raisman said: 'This [procedure] opens the door, which I had always been knocking at - to see that our nervous system has the ability to repair itself. ‘This is the beginning of a repair for spinal injuries and other types of injuries - including stroke. ‘The idea that the nervous system can repair itself in rats and in one man - there’s no reason to restrict this to just the spinal cord. It opens the door to a future which is terrifyingly large. ‘We’ve climbed two mountains and we are now at the foot of the (next) mountain. We have knowledge which could be of great value, we can’t stop now. The Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation was founded by Briton David Nicholls after his son Daniel was paralysed in a swimming accident at the age of 18. He said: ‘I promised Dan that I would not give up until a cure had been found. Professor Raisman and Dr Tabakow’s breakthrough marks the first step.’","Darek Fidyka is the first person in the world to recover from chronic injuries .

"Fury has erupted in Hawaii after a local man posted footage on YouTube of him and his friends torturing a 14-ft tiger shark in Honokohau Harbor on Hawai'i Island. The tamed shark was well known to local residents, had been tagged and was lovingly referred to as Laverne by the local fishermen who regularly fed her. Cruel footage of the men abusing the animal was posted online by Mikey Mccrum on August 30.Entitled ‘Catching a 12-14 Ft Tiger Shark!,’ it has been viewed more than 65,000 times, attracting 861 dislikes and 39 likes. Scroll down for video . Cruel video footage shows Mikey Mccrum torture the tame shark which has broken off a piece of its tail in the struggle . The disturbing video, described as ‘Big Rope + Big Cable + Big Hook + Big Bait = LIVE ACTION with a Big SHARK!!!,’ starts with the shark already caught. Laverne is clearly distressed and fighting for her life while the men attempt to pull her towards land, while making macho boasts about what they’re doing. The video is labelled as ‘catch and release,’ but the two minute clip ends before you can see what happens to the tiger shark. Towards the end of the footage it's apparent Laverne has caused herself permanent damage to her tail in the struggle against the bullies and the top part of her fin has broken off. The animal was well known to local residents, she had been tagged and was lovingly referred to as Laverne by the local fishermen who regularly fed her . Mikey Mccum has caused outrage after posting footage of him torturing a tiger shark that had been tamed by local fishermen . Warning disturbing footage of animal cruelty . In Hawaii the footage has caused a public outcry. People who work at the harbor say the men deliberately picked on the tam animal because it was an easy target. They were spotted throwing raw fish into the harbor waters to attract the shark before they turned on it. ‘She's used to being in there and this kid took advantage of the situation and tortured her and abused her, and this is not acceptable,’ Oriana Kalama, who founded the non-profit Maui-based organization Ocean Defender Hawai'i, told Hawaii News Now. 'It's [the footage] viewed around the world as a person who lives in Hawaii who disrespects, not only our environment, but our cultural beliefs,' she said. Unfortunately it doesn’t appear that any legal action can be taken against Mccrum and his thuggish friends. Fishing isn’t prohibited in the area, . and aren't currently protected under animal cruelty laws on Hawai'i . Island, although that could soon change. Laverne puts up a fight against the bully and manages to break off the top part of her fin as she struggles . Kalama has called for Mccrum, whose . Facebook page features photos of him posing with dead boar, to publicly . apologize for his actions. Tiger sharks are common in Hawaii and some do attack humans, although this particular one was tame and certainly didn't deserve to be tortured. On YouTube, the majority of commentators have been appalled at Mccrum's cruelty. 'If you killed the shark and didn't eat it, that's disgusting. If you released the shark, then you've put an injured predator back into the water at a spot where dozens of people swim and dive every day,' wrote one person. 'Karma or Mother Earth my friends will take care of these low life people,' commented another viewer. 'Respect, love and compassion for our environment and our creatures is necessary.  It's important, it's vital not only for our survival but the survival of our oceans, our community and us as people,' said Kalama.

Robin van Persie clenched his fist in delight and no little relief after responding to doubts over his Manchester United future with a thumping strike which completed a one-sided afternoon at Old Trafford. Manager Louis van Gaal kept faith with Van Persie despite considering his fellow Dutchman low on confidence after touching the ball only 13 times in the previous game at Arsenal. It proved to be an astute decision as RVP set up United’s second goal for strike partner Wayne Rooney, then turned Hull defender James Chester to score a great goal himself midway through the second half.

How much it meant to Van Persie was understood by the United players, who ran over to celebrate with their under-pressure team-mate. And when he was substituted four minutes later, he received a standing ovation from the United fans, and applauded them back. It was a satisfying return to form for the player and his team showed that they are warming to their task under Van Gaal. Afterwards, the striker who is seen as vulnerable if United buy big again next summer, admitted that finding the back of the net had been a huge relief, particularly as his manager had described his last performance as ‘very bad’. ‘I needed that goal, to be honest,’ he said. ‘We played really well, you could see that in the way we passed the ball. Every week it gets quicker and better. We could have won 4-0 or 5-0.’ Van Gaal was naturally pleased to see his World Cup captain back in the goals for just the fourth time this season, but he was not going overboard on Van Persie’s all-round display. ‘Every striker needs a goal when they haven’t scored for three or four matches,’ said United’s manager. ‘I am very pleased and happy with him for his goal, but he can still play better. ‘He played No 10 and not No 9 at the beginning of the game. When I was forced to put him in a striker’s position because of the injury to (Angel) Di Maria, he played better. I am pleased he scored and had an influence on the game.’ The only downside to an easy win that harked back to Sir Alex Ferguson’s days when the opposition looked scared stiff of United were the injuries to Di Maria and Wayne Rooney. Di Maria asked the bench to remove him after 14 minutes having felt a hamstring twinge and will not be risked when United hope to build on their recent run at home to Stoke City on Tuesday night. Rooney, who scored the second goal from Van Persie’s assist, was left hobbling after an earlier kick on the calf from Robbie Brady was supplemented by a bang on the knee in stoppage time. ‘He has already told me he wants to play against Stoke, but Rooney always says that,’ smiled Van Gaal. ‘We will know in 48 hours.’ In contrast, Hull were dismal as former Old Trafford skipper Steve Bruce watched from the dug-out in his 700th game as a club manager.They have lost four on the trot and he admitted: ‘It was a tough afternoon for us, no doubt about it.

Bruce picked five defenders and even that backfired with Van Gaal surprisingly claiming afterwards he knew about the visitors’ tactics in advance. ‘We trained for it, to move the ball quicker,’ he said. ‘This is the first match that we have dominated the game from the first minute until the last, in a way that I like.’ United went ahead after 16 minutes but it was the scrappiest of goals. Nikica Jelavic and Curtis Davies got in each other’s way as they challenged Marouane Fellaini for Rooney’s corner and, after Chris Smalling’s initial header had been returned to him by goalkeeper Allan McGregor, the defender tried his luck again with his right foot from six yards. In almost slow motion, McGregor parried the shot but the ball deflected off his left knee and rolled just over the line, with referee Anthony Taylor pointing to the centre spot after receiving a bleep from goal-line technology.United proceeded to dominate possession though Van Persie’s usually trusty left peg let him down from eight yards when he had only McGregor to beat.

The penalty certainly looked soft, but Martin Atkinson pointed to the spot and Mile Jedinak converted for a 25th-minute equaliser which, until that stage, had been nowhere in sight. Credit to Palace for finding a way back without the use of satellite navigation, but Monk would have had cause to debate the central decision, even if he did tread more cautiously after the furore around his recent complaints about referees. ‘It is difficult because the footage I have seen is pretty inconclusive,’ Monk said. ‘The referee gave the action that his legs have been taken away from him. 'The footage I have seen (shows) there is no leg contact between the two players. It is more of an upper body. ‘I’m not too sure but it is inconclusive. He has given it and we have to deal with it.’ Perhaps more contentious were the calls that let Chamakh stay on the pitch. He was booked for a foul on Neil Taylor and followed it by shouting at Atkinson. There was also a handball on the edge of his area and a petulant early throw of the ball after a decision. Asked if he was lucky to stay on, Monk said: ‘Possibly, but that is not my focus. I don’t focus on the other team. I focus on my team.’ In which case, he has some work to do when it comes to holding on to leads in games.

Having led through Wilfried Bony’s goal after 15 minutes, by which point Swansea had already missed two good chances in a dominant opening, the home side made it 13 points dropped from winning positions this season. But it would be unfair to draw too much attention away from Neil Warnock’s side. Whatever the merits of the penalty decision — Warnock thought it was a good call — they bounced back remarkably well from a terrible start and should have led after Jedinak’s equaliser, when Chamakh went clean through and shot straight at Lukasz Fabianski. Warnock said: ‘The first 20 minutes were as bad as I’ve seen us play since I’ve been at the club. 'We couldn’t pass water. It was really poor. I thought it would be double figures after 15 minutes. ‘I saw Swansea batter Arsenal a couple of weeks ago so I knew how difficult it was going to be. 'Swansea always control the game. That’s how they are. But you have to give us credit as a lot of teams could have laid down. ‘We had a great chance at 1-1 with Chamakh’s chance and I went positive at the end and I thought we could pinch it.

If it was really frustration over Aston Villa’s alarming slump that persuaded the Irishman to quit as Paul Lambert’s assistant on the eve of this game, then there was ample evidence at Turf Moor to explain why. This was a game Villa should have won. Yet they ended up hanging on for a point after Danny Ings’s 87th-minute penalty cancelled out Joe Cole’s first-half goal and set up a grandstand finish to a breathless, full-blooded encounter.

It is now nine games in a row without a win for Villa; six defeats followed by three straight draws. Cole’s goal, on his first Premier League start for the club, made him only Villa’s third goalscorer in the Premier League this season, and that highlights the root of their problems. But having got ahead against a Burnley team with their tails up after back-to-back wins, they really should have held on. Their fans know it and added to Lambert’s problems by turning on their manager towards the end. ‘These guys pay their money, I’ve no problem with that,’ said Lambert. ‘That’s what can happen. It’s not nice to hear but that’s football. ‘For most of the game I was happy. I thought we were excellent. It’s the best we’ve played in a few weeks. 'We should have been two or three up at half-time and some of the football we played was outstanding.’ He had a point. Villa started at a frantic pace and went close to taking the lead on several occasions before Cole struck six minutes before half-time, Dean Marney twice heading away goalbound efforts and goalkeeper Tom Heaton a busy man. The breakthrough came after a flashpoint following Marney’s late lunge on Ciaran Clark deep in the Villa half. Goalkeeper Brad Guzan pumped a freekick forward and Dave Jones could only head the ball onwards to Andreas Weimann on the right. The Austrian slid a pass towards the edge of the six-yard box where Michael Keane was playing Cole onside and the former England star did not hesitate, turning to steer the ball inside Heaton’s near post. It was Cole’s first goal since last December. ‘I wish Joe Cole had come here five years ago but I couldn’t afford him,’ lamented Lambert. Knowing that a win would see Villa replace them in the relegation zone, Burnley stepped up the pace in the second half with Michael Kightly firing their best chance straight at Guzan from close range.

And when Jores Okore was penalised for dragging down substitute Lukas Jutziewicz late on, Ings stepped up to convert his fourth goal in five games. There was still time in five added minutes for Ings to prod the ball agonisingly against the post and Jutkiewizc to head inches wide as Villa clung on. Keane will be more than happy that he wasn’t here to see it. ‘In the end with the chances we created, you’re scratching your head how we didn’t win,’ said Burnley boss Sean Dyche. ‘But take away the last eight minutes and it was a real close affair. ‘It’s a great sign of what we want to achieve that we come away disappointed after not beating Aston Villa after being a goal down.

"Manchester United will continue to be big spenders despite paying out a staggering £150million on new signings this summer. Although six players have arrived at Old Trafford — including Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria — United expect to be busy in the next few transfer windows, according to senior club sources. There are concerns that Louis van Gaal’s squad still needs strengthening in defence and midfield, and Roma’s Kevin Strootman has already been lined up as a £25m target in January when the Holland star will have fully recovered from a serious knee injury. VIDEO Scroll down to Watch some of Kevin Strootman's best goals playing for PSV . Target: Manchester United already have their sights set on £25 Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman . Blockbuster: Radamel Falcao joined Manchester United on a season-long loan from Monaco . Big bucks: Louis van Gaal signed Angel di Maria for a British record fee of £60m from Real Madrid . VIDEO Di Maria needs time to settle - Van Gaal . Radamel Falcao (Monaco) - loan, £6m fee . Angel di Maria (Real Madrid) - £60m . Daley Blind (Ajax) - £14m . Marcos Rojo (Sporting Lisbon - £16m . Luke Shaw (Southampton) - £30m . Ander Herrera (Athletic Bilbao) - £29m . Total - £155million . United will not stop there as Van Gaal sets about reviving the fallen giants of English football after a spectacular summer of spending. Having broken the British transfer record to sign Di Maria for £60m, United pulled off a stunning deadline day deal for Falcao that could eventually cost them another £52m. The Colombia striker celebrated by joining his agent Jorge Mendes and other advisers for a Chinese meal in Manchester city centre in the early hours of Tuesday morning after the initial £6m loan move from Monaco went through well after the 11pm transfer deadline. ‘We were waiting until the last minute, but I didn’t lose my faith,’ said Falcao. ‘I am very happy to be part of this big club — Manchester United is the best team in England.’ United captain Wayne Rooney welcomed Falcao’s arrival even though the two players could end up competing for a place. Debut: Di Maria made his Manchester United bow in a 0-0 draw at Burnley . Prospect: United forked out £30m on English left back Luke Shaw from Southampton . Talent: Ander Herrera joined from Athletic Bilbao in a £29million switch this summer . ‘I obviously don’t know how it could affect my role, that is something you’d have to ask Louis van Gaal,’ he said. ‘But I think it’s a fantastic signing. It’s a real sign of intent from Manchester United.’ The club off-loaded several young British players as Danny Welbeck, Tom Cleverley, Michael Keane, Nick Powell and Tom Lawrence left the club, and Sir Alex Ferguson’s former assistant Mike Phelan yesterday questioned the direction the club had taken. ‘They have probably lost the way of Manchester United a little bit,’ said Phelan. ‘Someone like a Danny Welbeck has been part of United’s identity. That has been broken.’ Cleverley’s loan move to Aston Villa was not ratified by the Premier League until Tuesday. Reinforcements: Dutch defender Daley Blind signed for Manchester United for £14million . New challenge: English midfielder Tom Cleverley left Old Trafford to join Aston Villa on loan . The England midfielder was set to join Villa for £7.5m until Everton tried to hijack the move. Villa were then granted a two-hour extension to resurrect a loan deal for Cleverley after submitting a ‘deal sheet’ before the 11pm deadline. The document, signed by both clubs and the player, is an agreement in principle which gives all parties time to complete the formalities. The Premier League board approved the deal on Tuesday. Robin van Persie also dismissed as ‘total nonsense’ speculation that he may require knee surgery. He told Fox Sports NL: ‘I can say with my hand on my heart that I won’t be in a hospital to have the operation.’ Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page.","Manchester United will continue big spending after huge summer outlay .

"A dog trapped underground for four days in a drainage tunnel was rescued when its owner hired a digger to get her out. Lulu the Jack Russell disappeared down the unused pipe last Friday at Boveney Lock in Dorney, Buckinghamshire, when owner Gina Kaiser took her for a walk. But after darting into the 60cm-wide pipe under a car park she got stuck when she was unable to turn around because of rubble narrowing the tube. Scroll down for video . Crew Manager Pete Skinner is pictured emerging with Lulu the Jack Russell from an opening cut into the pipe . Ms Kaiser hired a digger to get to her pet but a passerby saw what was happening and contacted the fire brigade . Rescue workers dig a square piece of land where they believe the puppy to be stuck in the drainage tunnel . Ms Kaiser called the RSPCA but was told if she could hear Lulu barking the likelihood was she would find a way out of the disused pipe. They advised her to wait it out but as the days passed she became more and more anxious. Lulu, aged five, barked non-stop for . four days and kept herself alive by drinking the trickle of water . collected at the bottom of the pipe. Firefighters said there was a risk of the situation becoming hazardous so they stepped in to help with the rescue . Getting desperate, Ms Kaiser decided to hire her own JCB to cut the dog free. However, a passerby alerted the local fire service and they stepped in and launched a six-hour operation to rescue Lulu. A five-strong team used the digger, cutting equipment, spades and shovels to excavate a wide hole to get to the pipe which was more than eight feet underground. They then smashed their way into the drain and lifted Lulu free. Social worker Ms Kaiser said: 'The fire service have been brilliant, it shows there are some really good people about.' Fire brigade station manager Doug . Gruchy said: 'Lulu's owner had organised her own search, but the . situation was in danger of becoming hazardous. 'We . took the decision to carry out this rescue because of our concern for . the safety of her search party as well as for Lulu's welfare. 'We are obviously delighted that it has had a happy ending.' He . added: 'It's quite understandable that an owner, when faced with a . situation like this, will want to go to extraordinary lengths to save a . pet. 'But our advice to pet owners is to contact the RSPCA in the event of an incident of this type. They will then liaise with us if specialist rescue skills and equipment become necessary.' Firefighters have now closed off the entrances to the pipe and an adjacent one to prevent a repeat of the drama. They eventually managed to get to the tunnel underneath about four feet of earth . A rescuer had to get right into the tunnel to pull Lulu free. She had survived by lapping up water that trickled underneath her . Here she comes: Looking remarkably clean and calm, Lulu emerges from the pipe after a successful rescue . Lulu licking her lips at the thought of an imminent feed, pictured with her owner and a smiling team of firemen . Still licking her lips, an excitable Lulu bears the the muddy paw marks that suggest she scraped away at the pipe walls but to no avail. Thank goodness for mummy and that digger! It all becomes a bit much for Ms Kaiser as the four days' emotion finally takes it toll and she holds Lulu tight . Not letting her out of her sight, Ms Kaiser keeps a firm grip on her beloved pet after a tearful reunion and remarkable rescue. Home James!","Lulu went into drainage tunnel during a walk with owner Gina Kaiser .

"Everyone knows that stinging feeling when soap suds go in their eyes. But spare a thought for Raymond Cuss who was left screaming in agony when the 99p shower gel he was using burned his penis and testicles. The 42-year-old said a layer of skin was ripped off his privates while his manhood was left glowing bright red after using the Dettol-branded liquid soap. He was in so much pain that even when his underwear brushed against the affected area he doubled over in pain. Raymond Cuss was left with severe burns to his testicles after using Dettol-branded shower gel he bought from his local 99p Store . Mr Cuss feared being left scarred for life from the gel that he bought from a branch of 99p Stores in his home town Gosport, Hampshire. He has now been given £1,000 as part of an out-of-court settlement. He said: 'It was the first time I had bought this particular shower gel, and chose it because it had the Dettol brand on the front, which I trusted. 'I had a shower to freshen up when I got home from work and suffered an horrendous reaction. When I stepped out of the shower and looked down at my groin I could see I had been burned. 'At that point there was no pain but the area was inflamed, my penis was bright red, and I had lost a layer of skin. I was horrified and scared I may have suffered permanent damage. Mr Cuss bought the shower gel from a High Street branch of 99p Stores in Gosport, Hampshire . 'As the area dried, I was left in incredible pain, with a burning sensation. I had trouble sleeping, and could not lie on my front because it was far too painful. 'I had tears in my eyes when pulling on my boxer shorts, and if any material simply brushed the area I almost doubled over in pain. I grimaced with every move.' He added: 'I went to my local hospital and they said I had suffered burns. I don't have sensitive skin and had never suffered a reaction like this before. 'Because I'm self employed I had to go to work and battle through the pain, which was a real struggle. The whole incident left me feeling depressed because I feared my ordeal would never end. 'After a month of applying moisturiser at the doctors suggestion it healed and, thankfully, I have not suffered any lasting damage. 'I don't know what I'll do with the £1,000 but I certainly wont be spending it on shower gel in 99p Stores. 'I now get an even cheaper brand from Lidl.' 99p Stores suggested Mr Cuss' may have suffered a reaction when chemicals used in his job reacted with the gel. In a letter to Mr Cuss, his solicitor Ian Barnett said that the company said: '...the chemicals used during the course of your regular employment may have caused the reaction you suffered when they came into contact with the shower gel. 'By this they mean that ... (normally) the shower gel would not have affected you.' Mr Barnett contacted the makers of Dettol, Reckitt Benckiser, which examined the bottle and directed them to the supplier. A Reckitt Benckiser spokesman said: 'A review of the product packaging identified it as most likely a product originally made for the Korean market and imported as a grey market product.' Mr Cuss said he is pleased that he has now received the cash but still wants an apology. A spokesman said: '99p Stores can confirm a settlement was reached between the claimants and the supplier of this product. There's no question of the authenticity of this product.'","Raymond Cuss's skin fell off and he feared being scarred for life .
