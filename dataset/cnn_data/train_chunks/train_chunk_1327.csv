"Until now, Andermatt in Switzerland has been less known as a ski destination and  better remembered for a James Bond car chase where Sean Connery zips along the nearby Fruka Pass in an Aston Martin DB5 during Goldfinger. In the last year however, the modest ski resort has been placed  on the map thanks to the opening of The Chedi Andermatt. Tucked in the heart of the Swiss Alps, the hotel is a Goliath of a building, and the first five-star hotel to come to the sleepy area. The Chedi is drawing a very different clientele to the village including business types from Zurich and models from Milan. I visited it on the first day it opened for the 2014/15 winter season  to see whether it lived up to the hype. Tucked in the heart of the Swiss Alps, the The Chedi Andermatt is a Goliath of a building and the first five star hotel to come to the sleepy area . Jean-Michel Gathy has given the hotel a Asian-Alpine twist and every one of the bathrooms heave with Aqua di Parma toiletries . Designed by lauded architect Jean-Michel Gathy it’s an opulent, high-ceilinged series of four buildings with fur-lined sofas and glittering surfaces. Every room, corridor and restaurant is given Gathy's signature Asian-Alpine twist, which sounds oxymoronic, but works, giving the building the feeling of a dark, brooding Bond villain’s lair. The Chedi has 105 rooms including their prized Furka suite (£5,275 per night): a 3,552sq ft luxury abode for six people including a personal spa with steam bath, sauna and Jacuzzi. Visitors are allocated a ski butler to fit their skis, get their poles, warm their boots and take care of all kit requirements . Lighting, heating, curtains and gas fires in every room are controlled by the flick of an iPad and the hotel spans four buildings . Situated at the crossroads of three mountain passes in Urserental, the village of Andermatt is accessible via three alpine passes . More modest suites – if you can call them that - cost from £420 per night and come with a handmade Hastens bed, the same mattress makers that the king and queen of Sweden use. Mine was so comfortable it almost hurt to leave and the room was beautifully furnished with a lengthy balcony and cashmere shawls should you need some fresh air. Lighting, heating, curtains and gas fires in every room are controlled by the flick of an iPad and basins heave with Aqua di Parma toiletries. Downstairs, there’s a wine and cigar library, a walk-in humidor cheese room, a limousine service, a fleet of Audis to collect you from the slopes, two restaurants and plans for an ice rink next year. The piano in the lobby constantly tinkles come drinks o’clock and you’ll see more cashmere in a hour there than you did watching Cameron Diaz in The Holiday. The hotel has a 35m indoor pool and a 12m outdoor one where guests can relax after a long day on the Saint-Gotthard Massif mountains . The Furka suite (£5,275 per night) is a 3,552sq ft abode for six people including a personal spa with steam bath, sauna and Jacuzzi . The spa stretches 7,900sq ft  and is easy to get lost in. Guests can pick between hydrotherapy pools, a Finnish sauna and hammam, steam rooms, a plunge pool and myriad treatment rooms. I tried a 60-minute Alpine massage (200 CHF or £132) that was one of the best I’ve ever had. Afterwards  take a dip in the 35m indoor pool or 12m outdoor one - although as you swim lengths indoors those sipping champagne from the lobby can watch you through a huge glass window; a slightly odd design spec. Best of all though, visitors are allocated a ski butler to fit their skis, get their poles, warm their boots and take care of all  kit requirements. Visitors can enjoy a walk-in humidor cheese room (left) or a Japanese restaurant for dinner (right), one of the two restaurants in the hotel . The piano in the lobby constantly tinkles  and you’ll see more cashmere in a hour there than you did watching Cameron Diaz in The Holiday . If you're a keen skier you’ll happily spend a week here although the runs are more limited than other parts of Europe. The skiing area is slowly expanding with more chair lifts built or renovated year-on-year and there are cosy restaurants where you can eat schnitzel to your hearts content without weeping when the bill comes. A train traveling through Oberalp Pass in Andermatt (left) and a view of the river running through the  centre of the  village (right) In the spa guests can pick between hydrotherapy pools, a Finnish sauna and hammam, multiple steam rooms or a freezing plunge pool . A wine library room in The Chedi. Visitors can get to Andermatt from Stuttgart or Munich in four hours and from Milan in two hours . During the summer there is still a lot to do in Andermatt. Play on a 18-hole championship golf course or try cycling tours, hikes, horse riding, fishing and tennis. It’s a beautiful area, surrounded by high peaks of the Saint-Gotthard Massif, deep canyons, wild waterfalls and quiet mountain lakes. Situated at the crossroads of three mountain passes in Urserental, Andermatt is accessible via three alpine passes: the Oberalp Pass to the east, the St. Gotthard Pass in the south and the Furka Pass in the west, while the Schöllenen gorge is in the north. Visitors can get to Andermatt from Stuttgart or Munich in four hours, from Milan in two hours and Zurich in 90 minutes.

"Irish rock foursome U2 has been accused of 'cashing in' on The Troubles after apparently turning a Belfast street into a scene of bloody  violence for its new release. Production for what is believed to be the band's latest video is taking place on a residential street in the New Lodge area of north Belfast, a part of the city swamped by violence during the early 1970s. Dramatic photographs taken on the set depict what appears to be the aftermath of a bomb blast, with debris and shattered vehicles strewn across the street. Scroll down for video . Irish rock foursome U2 is believed to have turned a Belfast street into a scene of bloody street violence for their latest music video . The move has prompted criticism that the band is cashing in on The Troubles in Northern Ireland . Production is taking place on a residential street in the New Lodge area of north Belfast, a part of the city which was swamped by violence during the early 1970s . Dramatic photographs taken on the set depict what appears to be the aftermath of a bomb blast, with debris and shattered vehicles strewn across the street . In other pictures, wounded actors are seen fleeing from their homes, grabbing onto their loved ones. The images - eerily similar to real scenes from the era of The Troubles - have caused a stir, with many taking to Twitter to condemn the band for capitalising on the country's dark history. Others have claimed the video will only serve to remind the world about Northern Ireland's darkest days and prevent the country from moving on. One of U2's most famous hits, Sunday Bloody Sunday, described the horror felt by an observer of The Troubles, focusing mainly on the Bloody Sunday incident in Derry in which British troops shot dead protesters. One user wrote: 'Good to see u2 cashing in on the troubles again', while another said: 'Thanks U2 for shooting a music video in Belfast that makes us look like we're still in the troubles.' Another person tweeted: 'Jeez are U2 making a music video in Belfast about the troubles? Can't we put the past behind us and show the world another side to us?' U2: Bono, Larry Mullen, The Edge and Adam Clayton at this year's Golden Globes . As the street was converted in a film set, people took to Twitter to condemn what was happening . In other pictures, wounded actors are seen fleeing from their homes, grabbing onto their loved ones . Meanwhile, the set has caused speculation among fans, with some claiming the video is for the band's upcoming single The Troubles - which is not about The Troubles. Others say it will be the music video for Raised by Wolves - a song which talks about a bombed street - while others claim it is for Every Breaking Wave. In Raised by Wolves, the lyrics reference a father being crushed under the weight of a cross, followed by the lines: 'Blood in the house, Blood on the street, The worst things in the world are justified by belief.' Others were more excited and supportive about the area being promoted in the video . The images, taken today, have caused a stir, with fans taking to Twitter to condemn the band for capitalising on Northern Ireland's troubled history . The set has caused speculation among fans, with some claiming the music video is for their upcoming single The Troubles - which is not about The Troubles . Others say it will be the music video for their hit Raised by Wolves - a song which talks about a bombed street . Band members Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen have so far not been spotted in the area. A spokesman for the group said it did not know if the set was being used for a U2 video. Today's filming is not the first time New Lodge has been used as the set for a music video. In 2011, popstar Rihanna brought the area to a standstill as she filmed the music video for her song We Found Love. U2 are currently releasing tracks from the latest album Songs of Innocence, which was given away to half a billion iTunes customers in September. It later went on general sale. Last month, frontman Bono, 54, had to have surgery after being injured in a bicycle crash.","Filming taking place in New Lodge, an area swamped by violence in 1970s .

"One of Europe's most successful spacecraft has gone gently into the silent night around the hottest planet in the solar system. Since 2006  Venus Express had been studying the second world from the sun in unprecedented detail, revealing - among many discoveries - that the planet may still be geologically active. But Esa has revealed that the spacecraft has now run out of fuel, bringing to a close this flagship European mission - and leaving Venus without any spacecraft in orbit. Esa in Paris has confirmed that its Venus Express spacecraft (illustrated) has died. The probe had been orbiting Venus  for eight years since 11 April 2006 - far exceeding its original planned lifetime of under two years. But it finally run out fuel during a series of daring atmospheric manoeuvres . Venus Express was launched back on 9 November 2005 and arrived at Venus on 11 April 2006. It was one of the longest-serving spacecraft to orbit the planet, despite initial estimates for the mission expecting it to last not even two years. Now it seems time has caught up with the spacecraft, though, as it has finally run out of fuel - which means contact cannot be made with it any more, as its antenna cannot be pointed towards Earth. Although it had far exceeded its planned life, scientists had recently been preforming a series of daring manoeuvres deep into the Venusian atmosphere as the spacecraft ran out of fuel. Venus Express was launched back on 9 November 2005 and arrived at Venus on 11 April 2006. It then orbited Venus in an elliptical 24-hour loop that began a distant 40,000 miles (66,000 km) over the south pole, affording incredible global views. Its orbit then took it to an altitude of just 155 miles (250 km) above the surface at the north pole, close to the top of the planet’s atmosphere, where it could observe and study the planet up close. Each orbit, however, required more and more fuel to be spent as the spacecraft battled against radiation exerted from the sun to maintain its speed. In May, routine science operations of the spacecraft ceased, with efforts shifted to making lower passes through the atmosphere. From 18 June until 11 July so-called ‘experimental aerobraking’ took place, with the spacecraft’s altitude gradually lowered. But now it has finally succumbed to these more extreme manouevres, having run out of fuel - meaning it can no longer position itself to communicate with Earth. Unlike cars and aircraft, spacecraft are not equipped with fuel gauges, so the time of propellant exhaustion for any satellite - especially after such a long time in space - is difficult to predict. However, while the end could not be predicted, it was not completely unexpected as it was known the spacecraft would be running low on fuel. Full contact with Venus Express was lost on 28 November. Since then some communications had been partially re-established, but they were very unstable and only limited information could be retrieved. Without propellant, there is no chance of restarting communications. It is also impossible to raise the altitude further, meaning that the spacecraft will naturally sink deeper into the atmosphere over the coming weeks and ultimately burn up in the atmosphere of Venus. 'The available information provides evidence of the spacecraft losing attitude control most likely due to thrust problems during the raising manoeuvres,' said Patrick Martin, Esa's Venus Express mission manager. 'It seems likely, therefore, that Venus Express exhausted its remaining propellant about half way through the planned manoeuvres last month.' Adam Williams, Esa's acting Venus Express spacecraft operations manager, added that they knew the spacecraft was 'running on fumes' but they were pleased to push the boundaries 'right down to the last drop'. Venus Express can no longer re-position itself to communicate with Earth. However, the mission was hugely successful, revealing that Venus (shown) may still be geologically active - and also revealing increasing wind speeds in its atmosphere over just six years . In a few weeks the spacecraft will go out in a 'blaze of glory' as it silently plunges into the Venusian atmosphere (illustration shown). It ran out of fuel as it was performing lower and lower drops into the atmosphere in a bid to glean more science before the mission ended . However, despite now coming to a conclusion end, the mission returned some key science in its eight years around the planet. 'While the science collection phase of the mission is now complete, the data will keep the scientific community busy for many years to come,' said Håkan Svedhem, Esa's Venus Express project scientist. Venus Express was not the first spacecraft to journey into the Venusian atmosphere. That honour is bestowed to a series of Soviet spacecraft in the 1960s, 70s and 80s called the Venera probes. About a dozen were sent on daring missions to the surface of Venus, with only a handful being successful. The intense heat and atmospheric pressure crushed each of the probes in up to about an hour once they had penetrated the atmosphere - but a few managed to survive long enough to return data and images. The Venera probes were succeeded by the Vega spacecraft, high-altitude balloons that were sent into the atmosphere of Venus on scientific missions. One highlight from the mission was the tantalising hint that the planet may  still be geologically active today. A study found numerous lava flows that must have been created no more than 2.5 million years ago - just yesterday on geological timescales - and possibly even much less than that. And even though the conditions on the surface of Venus are extremely inhospitable today, a survey of the amount of hydrogen and deuterium in the atmosphere suggests that Venus once had a lot of water in the atmosphere, which is now mostly gone, and possibly even oceans of water like Earth's. Studies of the planet's 'super-rotating' atmosphere - it whips around the planet in only four Earth-days, much faster than the 243 days the planet takes to complete one rotation about its axis - also turned up some intriguing surprises. When studying the winds, by tracking clouds in images, average wind speeds were found to have increased from roughly 185 to 250 mph (300 to 400 km/h) over a period of six Earth years. At the same time, a separate study found that the rotation of the planet had slowed by 6.5 minutes since Nasa's Magellan measured it before completing its five-year mission at Venus 20 years ago. However, it remains unknown if there is a direct relationship between the increasing wind speeds and the slowing rotation. A study using data from Venus Express found numerous lava flows that must have been created no more than 2.5 million years ago (illustration of the Venusian surface shown) - just yesterday on geological timescales - and possibly even much less than that . 'Venus Express has been part of our family of spacecraft in orbit since it was launched in 2005,' says Paolo Ferri, Head of Esa Mission Operations. 'It has been an exciting experience to operate this marvellous spacecraft in the Venus environment. The scientific success of the mission is a great reward for the work done by the operations teams and makes us more proud than sad in this moment of farewell.' And Martin Kessler, Head of Esa Science Operations, added: 'While we are sad that this mission is ended, we are nevertheless happy to reflect on the great success of Venus Express as part of Esa's planetary science programme and are confident that its data will remain important legacy for quite some time to come. 'The mission has continued for much longer than its planned lifetime and it will now soon go out in a blaze of glory.'","Esa in Paris has confirmed that its Venus Express spacecraft has died .

"A fashion photographer is hoping to change the way that society views curvaceous women, by publishing a book featuring a series of images which celebrate fuller-figured women. New Yorker Victoria Janashvili, the woman behind coffee table book Curves, has had her work featured by the likes of GQ, Maxim, Esquire and Cosmopolitan, but insists that her 'personal projects' have always aimed to highlight the beauty of women with more normal bodies, rather than the slim models often pictured in the pages of magazines. 'My personal projects have always been aimed to portray a healthy and more relatable model,' she explains on her Kickstarter page, set up in order to fund the publication of her book, which is currently available for pre-sale. Scroll down for video . Risqué business: Plus-size models Denise Bidot and Marina Bulatkina both pose nude in the art photography book . Let's get real: Victoria Janashvili hopes that Curves will encourage women to feel more confident about their own body image . 'I feel very happy that the fashion magazines and [the] media in general [have] started to embrace a healthier image of a ""beautiful woman"" and that is why I strongly believe that this art book can help make a change even more.' Ms Janashvili enlisted the help of plus-size models Denise Bidot, who has featured in campaigns for Nordstrom, Levi's and Old Navy, and Marina Bulatkina, who recently modeled for discount fashion store Century 21, both of whom agreed to pose nude for the book. 'Even though the average American woman is a size 14, our society continues to set sterotypes as standards when it relates to the real body image of women,' Ms Janashvili added. 'This is why I spent years of my time taking pictures of different types of models and took part [in] numerous body image awareness campaigns that went viral, and caused lots of discussions. 'Through my book, I would like to continue to spread the mission and break social stereotypes, so we can take a stand on women feeling confident within their own skin.' 'Your wife,  your daughter, your girlfriend, you': The photographer hopes that her book will appeal to women - and men - of all ages and body types . Feel the love: Ms Janashvili insists that the 'future of healthy booties' depends on the publication of her book . Thus far, the photographer has raised just over $4,000 since launching her Kickstarter page two days ago - and she is confident that this total will continue to rise as more people speak out in support of the project. 'Your wife, your daughter, your girlfriend, your mother and most importantly YOU, will look at yourself differently, more [healthily], and more importantly, less; by expanding, and then reclaiming, the discussion about appearance, we can remove some of the focus from it in women’s lives, old and young,' she writes. 'We love your booty. Get it behind this book. The future of healthy booties, big and small, may depend on it.' Ms Janashvili has been praised by women from around the world as a result of the book, with many hailing her as an 'inspiration' to people of all ages and body types. 'I feel better about my body now': The book has had support from women around the world, including a 62-year-old grandmother from Puerto Rico who praised Ms Janashvili the perfect role model . Breathtaking: Many people have commented how beautiful each of the images in the book are . 'As someone who is considered plus size, your work is simply breathtaking,' one woman wrote. 'Seeing women feel as beautiful as they do in your photographs inspires me more than you could imagine.' Another added: 'I am a 62-year-old grandmother, who lives in Puerto Rico. Today I was thinking I didn't want to die without having some sexy pictures taken. 'I never had the nerve to do it while I was young because I was always self conscious about my body, even when I was beautiful and skinny. 'But looking at your photographs and how gorgeous the models look I feel better about my body.'","New Yorker Victoria Janashvili has created a new book, entitled Curves, which includes a number of nude images of plus-size women .

"The White House chief of staff says President Barack Obama is 'madder than hell' about reports of treatment delays at veterans' hospitals across the country. Top aide Denis McDonough tells CBS' Face the Nation that Obama is demanding that Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki and others in the administration 'continue to fix these things until they're functioning the way that our veterans believe they should.' Allegations of preventable deaths that may be linked to delays at the Phoenix VA hospital have triggered an election-year uproar. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Madder than hell': President Obama is said to be furious about the mishandling of veterans' healthcare clinics . On Friday, Robert Petzl, the top official for veterans' health care, resigned - a decision that was not left up to him, according to McDonough. 'There is no question that this is a termination of his job there before he was planning to go,' McDonough told CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett. Petzel, the undersecretary for health care at the VA, resigned abruptly on Friday, just a day after telling a U.S. Senate committee that he knew in 2010 about a memo describing 'inappropriate scheduling practices' now blamed for as many as 40 deaths at VA medical centers. Veterans Affairs Undersecretary for Health Dr. Robert Petzel has resigned just a day after testifying in a contentious Senate hearing about a VA health care scandal tied to as many as 40 deaths . Focus: Millions of military veterans depend on VA hospitals and clinics for acute and long-term medical care, and the system has been rife with wait-list problems for years . Complaints about long wait lists and falsified patient appointment reports have dogged VA hospitals and clinics nationwide. Petzel, a 40-year veteran of the VA system and its . undersecretary for health, tendered his resignation even though he was . already scheduled to retire later in the year. The White House announced . his successor on May 1 but said Petzel would remain in his job until . Jeffrey Murawsky, director of the VA's Illinois-based Great Lakes Health . Care System, wins Senate confirmation. Secretary . Eric Shinseki requested and received Petzel's resignation but has . steadfastly insisted upon staying put himself, despite calls from . prominent Republicans and Democrats for his ouster. White . House Press Secretary Jay Carney released an approving statement late . in the afternoon about the resignation, which was announced just an hour . after his final daily press briefing of the week concluded. 'The president supports Secretary Shinseki’s decision,' Carney said, adding that President Obama 'has asked Secretary Shinseki to conduct a review of Veterans Health Administration practices and procedures at its facilities nationwide to ensure better access to care, and that review is ongoing.' 'The president and Secretary Shinseki take the allegations around misconduct very seriously,' he added. Shinseki said in a statement that 'most veterans are satisfied with the quality of their VA health care, but we must do more to improve timely access to that care.' On Thursday, both Shinseki and Petzel men testified in a Senate Veterans Committee hearing. Shinseki said then that he was 'mad as hell' about the growing scandal but wouldn't terminate any underlings until an inspector general report was completed. That report's conclusions are expected in early June. Petzel acknowledged to lawmakers that he had seen a 2010 memo titled 'Inappropriate Scheduling Practices,' which described failures in several of the VA's 21 service regions. Shinseki, seated next to him, insisted that 'I was not, I am not' aware of it. Recent revelations blame shoddy management for the deaths of dozens of former soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, as administrators in Phoenix – and possibly elsewhere – maintained a secret off-the-books waiting list for veterans in need of critical care. Official lists were kept short so the agency could appear to be doing its job despite some waits being more than a year long. In one case, a Phoenix official was awarded bonuses based on fraudulent statistics as veterans died waiting for medical care. 'We have been working continuously to try and identify where those sites are and what we need to do to prevent that from happening. It's absolutely inexcusable,' Petzel told lawmakers Thursday. 'The individuals are ... held accountable,' he insisted, while admitting that  'I can't give you an example specifically.' 'But if someone were found to be manipulating inappropriately the scheduling system, they would be disciplined.' 'I don't know whether anybody was specifically disciplined around that issue,' he later conceded. Next to go? Petzel (R) is out, but VA Secretary Gen. Eric Shinseki (C) is refusing to resign . Standing guard: Members of the American Legion have attended hearings and applied pressure throughout the VA scandal, demanding Shinseki's resignation at every turn . Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal grilled Shinseki about the allegations of wrongdoing and demanded to know if he would ask the FBI to investigae. 'We have more than allegations at this point,' Blumenthal said Thursday. 'We have evidence, solid evidence, of wrongdoing within the VA system, and it is more than an isolated instance of wrongdoing – it’s a pattern and practice.' Shinseki would say only that he would 'make that [option] available to the VA inspector general 'if that’s his request.' Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki's future is a delicate subject: He's a decorated veteran, twice wounded in the Vietnam War, a former Army Chief of Staff, and a Hawaiian-American who retired as a four-star general . In addition to the Phoenix scandal, VA offices have reportedly destroyed more than 1.5 million medical orders in recent years without confirming that patients received the treatment they were supposed to get. Similar reporting has shown that backlogs of medical appointments in Los Angeles and Dallas VA facilities were wiped off the books to make appointment backlogs appear far shorter than they were. The White House has expressed continued confidence in Shinseki, a wounded warrior who rose to the rank of four-star general before taking on the thankless job of managing the VA. Key to the Obama administration's defense of its leading veteran advocate is the ongoing inspector general investigation. But members of Congress are still smelling blood and want Shinseki to resign next. House Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican, said in a statement Friday that 'Petzel's ""resignation"" is the pinnacle of disingenuous political doublespeak. Petzel was already scheduled to retire in 2014 and President Obama has already announced his intention to nominate Petzel’s replacement, so characterizing this as a ""resignation"" just doesn’t pass the smell test.' “Desperate to get ahead of a delays in care crisis that is growing by the day, yet apparently unwilling to take substantive actions to hold any of its leaders accountable for negligence that harms veterans, VA has resorted to what it does best: splitting semantic hairs to create the illusion of accountability and progress,' Miller added. Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said Thursday that Obama 'needs to find a new leader to lead this organization out of the wilderness, and back to providing the service our veterans deserve.' Tom Tarantino, chief policy officer for the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, told The Hill that 'we don’t need the VA to find a scapegoat; we need an actual plan to restore a culture of accountability throughout the VA.'","Robert Petzel, the VA undersecretary for health, quit abruptly on Friday, just a day after testifying before a Senate committee .

"With Stephen Colbert bowing out from his Comedy Central show on Thursday, the network has unveiled the first promo for his replacement Larry Wilmore. Emmy-winning comedy veteran Wilmore was previously Senior Black Correspondent on The Daily Show With John Stewart. He was first announced as Colbert's replacement in May when the show was called The Minority Report, but the name has since been changed to The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore. Scroll down for video . With Stephen Colbert bowing out from his Comedy Central show on Thursday, the network has unveiled the first promo for his replacement Larry Wilmore . The promo clips riffs on the idea that Wilmore, who despite his experience isn't a recognizable name, as he introduces himself to a diner full of slightly confused people . The promo clips riffs on the idea that Wilmore, who despite his experience isn't a recognizable name, as he introduces himself to a diner full of slightly confused people. Wilmore promises to bring a bit more diversity to late night television and extra 'Nightly-ness' as he describes it in the clip. The show, created by Wilmore alongside former Daily Show Executive Producer Rory Albanese, aims to tackle current events from the perspective of the underdog. The show's name got changed after Fox decided to develop a pilot based on the 2002 Tom Cruise film Minority Report, reported The New York Times last month. Wilmore has said that the new name may actually convey the show's mission statement more accurately. 'It was never intended to be a show only about minorities,' he said. 'It's a show about underdogs, and that happens in a lot of different forms, whether it's race, gender or whatever.' The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore is scheduled to premiere on January 19 on Comedy Central, while Stephen Colbert's debut hosting The Late Show won't happen until the spring . Wilmore is a showbusiness veteran who has an Emmy Award to his name and has written for several shows including In Living Color, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, The Office and others. He also co-created The Bernie Mac Show. The comedian was also a writer on ABC's autumn comedy hit Black-ish, although he has now quit his involvement with that show.

"The Internal Revenue Service has lost two years worth of emails to and from embattled former tax official Lois Lerner, the agency told congressional investigators on Friday. The IRS promised on May 8 to turn over all her emails but now blames a computer crash for huge tranches of missing documents. Lerner is under investigation for allegedly orchestrating a years-long program that targeted tea party groups and other conservative organizations for unusually intrusive scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status beginning in the year before the 2010 congressional midterm elections. The House Ways and Means Committee, one of two bodies probing the case, said Friday that the IRS says that for the period of January 2009 through April 2011, the only Lerner emails it can find are those that were sent to or from other IRS employees. Emails whose sender or recipient was outside the government, or inside other agencies, have mysteriously disappeared. Those include the White House, the Justice and Treasury Departments, the Federal Elections Commission and Democratic congressional offices. Former Internal Revenue Service official Lois Lerner (C) exercised her Fifth Amendment right not to testify about her role in a scheme to target conservative nonprofit groups, but Republicans held her in contempt of Congress and subpoenaed her emails -- which have now gone missing . Are you kidding me? Rep. Dave Camp., the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, said Friday that he would find it hard to believe the IRS moving forward . Ways and . Means Committee chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, said Friday . that 'the fact that I am just learning about this, over a year into the . investigation, is completely unacceptable.' 'He also said the claim 'calls into question the credibility of the IRS’s response to congressional inquiries.' Camp . pointed a finger at IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, who pledged in a . March 26 hearing to produce every document the agency had  which might . be related to the scandal. 'It . appears now that was an empty promise,' Camp said, complaining that . without emails between Lerner and government officials outside the IRS, . 'we are conveniently left to believe that Lois Lerner acted alone.' Republicans in Congress have charged that Obama administration officials were part of a conspiracy to hamstring tea party groups in 2010 and beyond, since denying or delaying their tax-exemption applications prevented them from raising money during the years when their influence was at its highest. Hundreds of the right-wing organizations were forced to wait more than three years for action on their applications, while politically liberal groups were typically approved quickly. In one case Lerner, then in charge of the IRS's Exempt Organizations Division, personally signed the approval granting tax-exempt status to the Barack H. Obama Foundation, a charity headed by the president’s half-brother. That . approval was granted in less than a month, and back-dated – a highly . unusual move – to allow the charity to avoid paying taxes on money it . had raised prior to applying. Are the 'Lerner emails' the new 'Nixon tapes'? Conservatives are crying cover-up as the IRS claims it has lost years worth of emails between Lerner and government officials outside her agency . Congress . held Lerner in contempt this year following her refusal in 2013 and . 2014 to obey a subpoena and testify in an open hearing. She had invoked her Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination, but after reading a lengthy statement absolving herself of any wrongdoing. The IRS said Friday that it is producing 67,000 emails written by and to Lerner between 2009 and 2013. 'The IRS is committed to working with Congress,' the agency said in a statement. 'The IRS has remained focused on being thorough and responding as quickly as possible to the wide-ranging requests from Congress while taking steps to protect underlying taxpayer information.' California Republican Darrell Issa isn't buying it. 'Isn't it convenient for the Obama administration?' the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said in a statement. 'Do they really expect the American people to believe that, after having withheld these emails for a year, they're just now realizing the most critical time period is missing?' 'The supposed loss of Lerner’s emails further blows a hole in the credibility of claims that the IRS is complying with congressional requests,' his statement barked, 'and their repeated assurances that they’re working to get to the truth.' 'If there wasn't nefarious conduct that went much higher than Lois Lerner in the IRS targeting scandal, why are they playing these games?' Jenny . Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, said late on Friday that . the IRS's claim 'doesn’t pass the smell test and smacks of obstruction . of justice.' 'How is it that so many emails were simply ""lost?"" Why was there no data backup?' she asked. Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said the IRS's failure to produce all of Lerner's emails would be 'an outrageous impediment to our investigation.' Americans for Tax Reform, the anti-tax-hike group helmed by Reagan-era conservative warrior Grover Norquist, went further still – drawing a parallel to the Nixon administration. Resurgence: Tea party conservatives, once thought to be on the wane, had something to crow about on Tuesday when economics professor Dave Brat defeated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a primary race blowout . Tea party back on the rise: The conservative movement hamstrung for years by an allegedly nefarious IRS is back on the upswing with Brat's recent Republican primary victory in Virginia . 'This . is the worst attempt to blame technology in service of a cover-up since . the infamous ""18-minute gap"" during the Nixon Watergate crisis,' Norquist said Friday. 'Only in this case the gap is not 18 minutes, but two years. This cover-up is far worse.' President Richard Nixon's loyal secretary Rose Mary Woods claimed in 1973 that she caused the infamous 'gap' in recordings of a June 20, 1972 Oval Office meeting when she held down the wrong button on a tape recorded while answering a phone call. Demonstrating later how this might have happened, Woods showed reporters how she claimed to have operated unrelated telephone and tape-recorder controls located several feet apart, contorting her limbs in what journalists mockingly called 'the 'Rose Mary Stretch.' Democrats at the time alleged that the erasure was a deliberate attempt to erase part of a conversation between Nixon and White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman about a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. White House lawyers didn't turn the tapes over to Federal Judge John Sirica, who had subpoenaed them, until a week after they first knew the gap existed. Under a cloud of suspicion and facing unrelenting questions about his involvement in the break-in, Nixon resigned less than a year later.","More than a year after receiving a subpoena, the IRS says there's a 28-month period where Lerner's emails to and from people outside the IRS no longer exist .

"Borussia Dortmund offered reasons to suggest it won’t simply be another Bayern Munich procession in this season’s Bundesliga as they impressively beat their Bavarian rivals in the Super Cup. Goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang secured victory in the curtain-raiser at Signal Iduna Park as Bayern were bossed from start to finish. But how much can we really read into this result? 12 months ago, Jurgen Klopp’s side beat Bayern 4-2 on this same ground in the same competition and duly went on to finish a distant 19 points behind, as well as losing to them in the Cup final. VIDEO Scroll down for German Super Cup highlights Dortmund 2-0 Bayern Munich . Clinical: Dortmund midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan (right) beats Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer to open the scoring . Super hero: Borussia Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (with Spiderman mask) celebrates his goal . First blood: Borussia Dortmund celebrate after winning the German Super Cup on Wednesday . Dortmund: Langerak, Piszczek, Sokratis, Ginter, Schmelzer, Kehl, Kirch, Hofmann, Mkhitaryan, Aubameyang, Immobile . Subs: Alomerovic, Subotic, Bender, Jojic, Grosskreutz, Ramos, Durm . Bayern: Neuer, Martinez, Lewandowski, Shaqiri, Gaudino, Boateng, Bernat, Rode, Müller, Alaba, Hojbjerg . Subs: Reina, Dante, Pizarro, Gotze, Lahm, Badstuber . And the Bayern side that lost here were well below full strength, with Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Bastian Schweinsteiger among the absentees from the squad and World Cup heroes Mario Gotze and Philippe Lahm starting on the bench. The team that lines up on the opening day of the Bundesliga season against Wolfsburg at the Allianz Arena on Friday week will be a completely different proposition. But this is a result for Dortmund to hold on to and their fans certainly celebrated as though the result is a good omen for the nine months to come. They fielded Ciro Immobile, the top scorer in Serie A last season who moved from Torino, and he troubled Manuel Neuer with a 10th-minute effort that flew narrowly wide. Concern: Bayern midfielder Javier Martinez lies injured on the pitch during the German Super Cup . Blow: Bayern's Javier Martinez is being carried off on a stretcher after suffering a knee injury . The World Cup-winning goalkeeper was forced into action when Oliver Kirch found space to shoot inside the box, diving to his left to deny the Dortmund man. With the vocal home crowd encouraged, it wasn’t long before Borussia took a deserved lead for their early pressure. It was a move started and finished by Mkhitaryan, who ghosted past youngster Gianluca Gaudino before playing in Aubameyang down the left. The striker’s effort was blocked but it came out invitingly for the Armenian, who rattled the ball past Neuer and into the bottom left corner. Dortmund continued to dictate the pace, with Thomas Muller surprisingly anonymous and Bayern’s midfield unable to gain any control. Gabon forward Aubameyang tested Neuer at his near post, but the goalkeeper produced a low reaction save. There was plenty for Pep Guardiola to be worried about and it got worse when Javi Martinez was forced off on a stretcher after landing heavily on his knee. Setback: Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski suffered defeat in his first game against former club . Gesture: Bayern boss Pep Guardiola tries to motivate his players during German Super Cup . Focused: Dortmund's Marcel Schmelzer, right, challenges for the ball with Munich's Thomas Mueller . Dante replaced him but the defender was unable to stem the yellow tide. Shortly before the break, Neuer saved well from Kirch and Jonas Hoffman in quick succession, though both efforts were aimed straight at the German No 1. Back on his old ground, Robert Lewandowski was well shackled but at least he was spared the ear-splittingly negative reception given to Mario Gotze when he came on. He may have delivered Germany the World Cup exactly a month ago but old club loyalties die hard in these parts. Three minutes after the midfielder’s introduction, Dortmund scored a match-killing second goal. Neat build-up down the right led to Lukasz Piszczek swinging in a perfect cross that Aubameyang headed home. The striker celebrated by pulling out a Spiderman mask, before he was swiftly replaced by Adrian Ramos. Bayern’s spirit faded and Immobile, quiet for long spells, burst into life to drag wide. But there was no late rally from the champions and Dortmund saw out time to land the first blow of the season. But, even as they lifted the trophy and paraded in front of their jubilant fans, they know the struggle to catch Bayern is only just beginning.","Hendrikh Mkhitaryan opened the scoring for Borussia Dortmund .

"Jon Griffiths' holiday snaps are more extreme than most. For a start, the majority of them were taken at more than 13,000ft high. The 31-year-old climber has been climbing and exploring the Alps for more than ten years, and has published a book with images from his most challenging expeditions. The Kuffner Arete at sunrise: Jon's photographs are featured in his book Alpine Exposures and were taken at locations across the European Alps . Climber Jon Griffith has published a book covering some of the most extreme routes he has completed. This image shows climber Ben Briggs on the first crux gendarme on the Diables Arete - Mont Blanc du Tacul . The images, which are featured in Alpine Exposures, were taken at locations across the European Alps including the breathtaking Mont Blanc mountain range crossing France, Italy and Switzerland. Mr Griffith said: 'They are concentrated mainly on the area around Chamonix, in France, and the Mont Blanc Massif. 'Some are taken in other parts of the Alps such as the Matterhorn and the Eiger North Face.' Climber Ueli Steck soloing up the Nollen route on the Monch North Face, in Oberland, Switzerland . The sun sets during a turbulent storm in Midi Arete, Chamonix, showing how the weather can turn so quickly on the mountainside . Mr Griffith captures the images as he climbs and they often feature his climbing partners. He added: 'All the images in the book are real. Key to my work is that none of the shots are set up or staged which is why there is an extended caption for each image with the story behind it.' The majority of the images were captured on peaks of 13,000ft, although some Alps photos are taken at heights of up to 15,700ft.

Jon Griffith said he was inspired to begin climbing after the death of his mother from cancer ten years ago . Mr Griffith turned to the mountains after his mother was diagnosed with, and died of, cancer. In the book, he says: 'I experienced a grief on a level I didn't think I could ever experience. 'I've been lucky enough to lead an incredible life over the last decade which ironically was born out of those unfortunate events ten years ago and drove me to the mountains'. Mr Griffith uses a Canon 5D Mark III camera to capture the incredible views. The book features images as well as short stories about each climb as well as landscape, skiing, ice climbing and paragliding photos. Mr Griffith said: 'I wanted to create something unique. 'I have never been happy just recreating old shots, or shooting where others have shot before. 'For me, my passion lies in climbing some of Europe's hardest routes and bringing back professional images of those routes to show to the world. 'There are plenty of stand alone images, but I also wanted to share stories about climbing some of these routes as well as some of my more interesting work shoots. Mr Griffith describes the mountains in the book's foreword as 'a simple and basic place removed from human-created stresses and pressures of society'. He added: 'My favourite place is Pakistan, for me the holy grail of my work is to climb an unclimbed technical 7,000m peak out there. 'The climbing is incredibly intense and committing - to come back with images and video of these climbs is really what my last ten years as a photographer and climber has led to.'","Jon Griffith has published a book featuring images of his toughest climbs .

"A doctor has been convicted of involuntary manslaughter following the death of a porn star who suffered a heart attack while undergoing her sixth breast enlargement operation. German Carolin Wosnitza, 23, who performed under the stage name 'Sexy Cora', died after going under the knife to boost her breasts from a size 34F to a 34G. An anaesthesiologist was today found guilty at a court in Hamburg of failing to ensure Ms Wosnitza had enough oxygen during the surgery in 2011. 'Sexy Cora': The 23-year-old died following an operation to boost her breasts from a size 34F to a 34G . The 56 year old female doctor, known only as M.F., was given a 15-month suspended sentence after being convicted of involuntary manslaughter, the dpa news agency reported. During the trial M.F. had told the court she took responsibility for the porn star's death, it said. 'Nightmare': A judge said the anaesthesiologist had made a 'unique, albeit terrible, mistake' Mrs Wosnitza, who appeared on the . German version of reality show Big Brother, was put into an induced coma . following serious complications during her breast enhancement surgery . two years ago. Her family were called to the . hospital in Hamburg, north Germany, where they were told she had been . without oxygen for a period of 15 minutes during the operation, and was . in a 'serious condition'. The heavily tattooed adult actress died nine days later, and an investigation was launched into the clinic. A judge at Hamburg district court described the events that unfolded at the clinic as 'a nightmare', according to thelocal.de. Rejecting calls to ban the anaesthesiologist from practising in the future, the judge told her the incident was 'a unique, albeit terrible mistake that you made'. He said she had failed to correctly monitor the 23-year-old's breathing, and that a long period elapsed before she realised there was a problem. The judge also criticised conditions at the clinic where the botched surgery took place. Mrs Wosnitza's widower had claimed the doctor turned off the alarm on the breathing monitor during his wife's surgery to avoid being distracted.","Carolin Wosnitza, 23, had a heart attack during her sixth breast op .

"Christmas is a time for full-on glamour, but I’m not a fan of plunging necklines which can look desperate on an older woman — unless you’re Joan Collins. However, too much fabric says ‘matronly’ and boring. How wonderful then that many of this year’s frocks come with a daring twist. Demure and covered at the front, they swoop sexily — in some cases perilously — low at the back. They’re marvellous fun at drinks parties: chat sweetly to the vicar while letting the chap behind know you’re less buttoned up than he thought. So which of the sexiest backless dresses on the High Street left me feeling full of Christmas sparkle? SHIMMERING CHIC . Gold sequin full length dress, £350, Phase-eight.com . I’m becoming seriously addicted to Phase Eight. This beautiful dress is part of their ‘Collection’ and, although it’s expensive, you get what you pay for. There’s loads of hand-finishing and the stunning sequins — muted enough to gleam elegantly rather than blind you — coupled with the elegant net, silky lining and gorgeous shape make me feel like a million-dollar mermaid. And — oh joy! — the cleverly positioned back strap, fitted with a cunning loop, enables you to wear a normal bra. Yesterday, I saw a bride emerging from Chelsea Register Office in this dress, and she looked stunning. 5/5 . FORGIVING AND FABULOUS . Coral maxi dress, £130, Honorgold.co.uk; earrings, £278, Dowerandhall.com . I leapt at this hour-glass shaped dress as soon as I saw it on the hanger: it’s such a gorgeous, mood-lifting colour, and not one I’d usually think of wearing. It’s very well priced, easy to wear and the stretchy lace is not only firm enough to keep me comfortable without a bra, it’s also very forgiving to any droopy bits. It fastens with a pretty diamante clasp, too. 5/5 . NO ROOM FOR A BRA . Bodycon dress, £65, Mistressrocks.com; shoes, £195, Lucychoilondon.com; earrings, £95, Dowerandhall.com . This was the hardest for me to wear: it looks good from a certain distance but it’s so tight and clingy that it would be best on someone younger. It’s very sexy and fantastic value for a designer lookalike, but you need to avoid it if you’ve any spare flesh. Brilliant for Christmas parties in a red, but make sure you’re chauffeured around — there’s no running for a bus or taxi in the tight skirt. And there’s absolutely no room for a bra — I went for a clever trick from my theatre days, a skin-to-fabric glue called ‘It Stays’. It really does. 3/5 . WHAT A LITTLE GEM . Navy jewel strap full-length dress, £45, Axparis.com; Earrings, £15, Coast-stores.com . Excellent all round this one, and an amazing price. It’s extremely comfortable and the high, elasticised Empire-line waist supported me just enough to make a bra unnecessary. The very pretty neckline is jazzed up with shiny ‘jewels’ and I love the cute little tie at the back, which makes it feel very secure — and sexy. 4/5 . HEART STEALER . Teal full-length dress, £69.99, Mango.com; necklace, £45, Coast-stores.com . Another very good price but the material feels rather stiff — there’s not much give in it so it needs to fit well and you wouldn’t want to overindulge on the cheese straws in this one. It’s tricky bra-wise as the sides are cut away at the back in a heart shape, so it needs the cups-only sticky-on type, but the shape is very flattering. 3/5 . SO GLAM - BUT BEWARE OF VPL . Long-sleeved full-length dress, £75, Hedonia.co.uk; sandals, £175, Russellandbromley.co.uk; belt, £60, and earrings, £18, Debenhams.com . Very good value for a glamorous red dress but the material is a bit thin and so clingy that you have to wear knickers without a VPL, or be brave and wear none at all! The good thing here is that the V at the back isn’t too wide, so you can get away with a sticky-winged bra with this — and the long sleeves are great if you worry about exposed arms. 3/5 .","Christmas is a time for full-on glamour .

"Thousands hoping to get away for Christmas could face chaos after airport staff voted to walk out for two days from December 23. Heathrow is expected to bear the brunt of the disruption, as nearly 500 check-in staff and ground crew members plan to strike over pay. Three of Heathrow’s five terminals will be affected, as well as Gatwick and Manchester Airports if the action goes ahead. The strike could affect check-in desks at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester airports . But last night, airport and airline bosses insisted they would cope. Heathrow said it had contingency plans in place to ‘minimise disruption for passengers’ and did not want to ‘raise unnecessary alarm’. The Unite union, which is behind the strike, said its members who work for air services provider Dnata at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester had voted by more than four to one in favour of the action. Dnata’s main customers include Virgin Atlantic, Emirates, Cathay Pacific, Turkish Airlines and Qantas Airways. The union said the strike was in protest at an imposed 2.2 per cent pay increase at a time when supervisors were being granted a rise of 4.5 per cent. It added that the walkout ‘would have an impact’ on air travellers, but that the extent of the chaos would depend on contingency plans put in place by management. Unite union has called for peace talks to avoid disruption at airports on December 23 and 24 . Unite represents around a quarter of the 1,900 Dnata staff who carry out check-in, ground crew and cargo duties at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester Airports. At Heathrow, the striking staff work in Terminals 2, 3 and 4. The walkout will not affect Terminal 5, where British Airways is based. Heathrow said Terminals 2, 3 and 4 handle around 45 per cent of the 1,300 flights and up to 200,000 passengers it processes each day. Turnout among the 460 Unite members eligible to vote was just 45 per cent. Of those who voted, some 83 per cent supported the strike ‘if the company continued to refuse to negotiate’. Unite said it was not its intention to wreck Christmas for families, but simply to get the firm around the negotiating table. A spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said: ‘We are being kept informed of the situation. Should the strike action take place, we are confident that Dnata will have contingency plans to keep disruption to passengers to a minimum.’ Five million Christmas travellers are set to pass through UK airports in the next week . Emirates, which runs up to half a dozen flights a day from Heathrow, said: ‘At this time, Emirates does not expect any changes to its current flight schedule.’ A Heathrow spokesman said it would have extra staff on hand, adding: ‘Passengers should allow plenty of time for travelling through the airport and speak to their airline if they have any concerns.’ Gatwick confirmed that as Dnata have only a small operation at the airport, no passengers would be affected if the strike goes ahead. A spokesman for Dnata said contingency plans to help passengers were being implemented, adding: ‘Unite members are a minority of our team in the UK.’","Staff employed by dnata at three UK airports voted for strike action .

"If you've always been plagued by a jittery grip when applying eye makeup, stick-on eyeliner could well be the big beauty trend you've been waiting for. The innovative make-up creation first premiered at Dior’s couture show in July, where it was reported by Allure that the brand’s make-up artist and creative director Peter Philips hand-cut 70 pairs of metallic slivers to create a 'highly contrasting and artificial' look. But now the trend has made its way onto the shelves, thanks to brands such as Dior, Lancôme and Violent Lips, all of whom currently offer a different version of the unusual accessory. Silver mystery: Stick-on eyeliner tattoos made a splash at a Dior couture show in July, and are now available in a limited edition from the makeup company as well as others . A clean look: The silver design debuted by Dior has been hailed as futuristic, but the eyelids have to be free of oils or other makeup before applying . Unsurprisingly, Dior’s take on the trend doesn’t come cheap, with four pairs of stickers costing a whopping $61. Lancôme’s Hypnôse Velours Multi-Wear Eyeliner Patches are much more affordable, at just $25 for three pairs, while Violent Lips charges $6 per pair. Designs feature a variety of colors and textures, including black or metallic, glossy or glittery and even velour. While some reviewers admitted that the stick-on liners were tricky to master on the first attempt, many have raved about the temporary eyelid tattoos, praising their versatility and, in the case of the black ones, convincing looks. Indeed, the only issue with the stickers seems to be that they usually have to be used alone, because other eye products can prevent them from sticking to your lids. But once they're in place, they'll stick around. No big commitment: more budget-friendly versions are also available, and are no more uncomfortable than a pair of false lashes . InStyle's tester almost gave up on her Violent Eyes Glitterati stickers, but, she wrote: 'Once I wiped my lids clean, the appliqués stuck, and they stayed in place until I peeled them off before going to bed.' She added: 'People at the office kept asking me how I was able to draw such perfect lines!' Though other styles can get expensive, they are also reusable, with Lancôme's Hypnôse Velours being capable of making the rounds three times before losing its glue, a Telegraph reviewer found. It also offers you three different shapes in one package, with upward and downward flicks for the more adventurous. Falsies: The eyeliner stickers are often reusable and can be stuck on the lower or upper lids, or even around the eyebrows . Dior's limited-edition Mirror Eyes Multi-Wear Adhesive Eyeliner Patches, styled after the couture show versions, are also reusable and come with extra adhesive. All the reviewers found their stick-ons comfortable, comparing them to false lashes that you can feel less and less over time. Ironically, they look best with a little help from the real thing: N.Y.C. makeup expert Troy Surratt. advised InStyle readers to 'place stickers as close to lash lines as possible, and use liquid liner to fill in gaps.'","Dior, Lancôme and Violent Lips all offer a selection of bold eye stickers .

"Pensioners are being warned to use protection on board cruise ships if they plan on having flings after a rise in the number of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among the elderly. A new government fact-sheet, titled 'Travel health on board cruise ships' has warned cruise passengers - who are predominantly over the age of 50 - that they should be prepared if they plan to have sex. The advice reads: 'If there is a chance you might have casual sex, be prepared: take in-date, good quality condoms with you.' Rate of sexual infection in people aged 65+ continue to rise, with men more likely than women to have some sort of STI (File Photo) OAPs are being warned to protect themselves in sexual encounters on board cruise ships (File Photo) There is also a warning that the consumption of alcohol can lead people to 'lose their inhibitions,' and that taking care of your sexual health should always be priority. Worrying, sexually transmitted infections are on the rise in the over-65 age group. Here are some facts and figures from the period 2009-2013... Chlamydia . 2009 - 94 (84 men, 10 women) 2013 - 298 (242 men, 53 women) Gonorrhoea . 2009 - 60 (56 men, four women) 2013 - 126 (117 men, nine women) Herpes . 2009 - 158 (109 men, 49 women) 2013 - 265 (163 men, 102 women) Syphilis . 2009 - 33 (32 men, one woman) 2013 - 46 (40 men, six women) Warts . 2009 - 316 (262 men, 54 women) 2013 - 417 (329 men, 88 women) Last year, the average UK passenger age of those who go on cruises was 57 and a quarter of passengers are over 60 years old. Despite many lines seeking to attract a younger clientele and families, the average age has risen from 54.8 to 57 in the last ten years. Travellers over the age of 60 also make up more than a quarter of cruise passengers, according to statistics. Statistics taken from 2009-2013 show an alarming rise in the number of STI diagnoses for men and women aged 65+. There were 295 confirmed cases of chlamydia in 2013, 242 of these were men with 53 women. The stats make worrying reading as in 2009 the number of confirmed cases was 94; 84 being attributed to men and 10 to women. The amount of people aged 65+ being diagnosed for gonorrhoea has more than doubled for the years 2009-2013. In 2009, 56 men aged over 65 and 60 women were diagnosed with gonorrhoea. In 2013 those numbers had risen significantly; there were 117 males cases of gonorrhoea and 126 where women were concerned.

"Spain found their fizz again in a 5-1 win over Macedonia that will further fuel the debate over whether they are better off without Chelsea striker Diego Costa. Costa’s hamstring injury meant Valencia’s young forward Paco Alcacer started his first game for La Roja and the 21-year-old had scored his first goal within 17 minutes. Cesc Fabregas played in Juanfran and his cross was turned in by the new No 9. Dream start: David Silva jumps on to Paco Alcacer's shoulders to celebrate his goal that put Spain 2-0 up against Macedonia in Valencia . Breaking away: Cesc Fabregas escapes a challenge from Macedonian midfielder Stefan Spirovski as Spain exerted their authority in the midfield areas . Easy does it: Sergio Ramos is congratulated after his cheeky chipped penalty put Spain ahead inside the Ciutat de Valencia stadium in Group C . New face: And before long Paco Alcacer was doubling the lead after a smart passing move which saw him presented with an open goal in his hometown . Muted celebration: Agim Ibraimi jogs back towards the half-way line after his penalty reduced the deficit to just one goal in the first half . Spain: Casillas; Alba, Abidol, Ramos (Bartra 68) , Juanfran; Busquets, Silva, Koke (Munir 77), Fabregas, Pedro, Alcacer (Isco 57). Scorers: Ramos 16 (pen), Alcacer 17, Busquets 45+3, Silva 50, Pedro 90+1. Booked: Koke, Fabregas. Macedonia: Pacovski, Cuculi, Sikov, Mosjsov, Alioski (Demiri 46), Trajkovski, Spirovski (Radeski 64), Ristovski, Abdurahimi (Velkoski 74), Jahovic, Ibraimi. Scorer: Ibraimi 28 (pen). Booked: Ristovski, Abdurahimi. Spain were already leading 1-0 after Sergio Ramos dinked in a Panenka-style penalty on the quarter of an hour mark after David Silva had been brought down – the Real Madrid defender repeating the trick from Spain’s success in the last European Championship. More impressive than the quickly established two-goal lead was the way the reigning champions of this competition were playing. Without the reference point of Costa upfront the passing was shorter and crisper and there was far more movement as Silva, Pedro and Fabregas buzzed around the new centre-forward, and full-backs Jordi Alba and Juanfran got forward to provide width. Costa is yet to score for Spain in five games having switched allegiance from his country of birth Brazil and played in Spain’s disastrous World Cup campaign. The free-flowing forward football did not prevent Macedonia briefly getting back into the game when Agim Ibraimi scored from the spot after Juanfran had brought down Aleksandar Trajkovski. Spain soon got their third when Alcacer turned provider this time for Sergi Busquets who scored his first international goal from the edge of the area with a deflected shot. The second half started with Iker Casillas justifying his selection ahead of Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea, keeping out Franco de Jahovic with a fine save . And it did not take long for Spain to make it four down at the other end when Alba got around the back of the visitors’ defence and pulled the ball back for Silva to score. It was his 21st goal for Spain – of non-strikers only fellow midfielder Fernando Hierro has scored more. Back in the game: Ibraimi's Macedonian team-mates congratulate him after he successfully converts the spot kick conceded by Juanfran . The bosses: Vicente del Bosque was back after offering his resignation after the World Cup and came up against Macedonia boss Boshko Gjurovski on the touchline . Combative: Ramos goes in hard for this header up against Macedonia's Stefan Ristovski during an aerial clash in the first half in Valencia . Dominant: Barcelona's Pedro takes the ball away from grounded Macedonian defender Ardijan Cuculi as Spain made their opponents work . Taking control: Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke, one of the newer members of Spain's starting line-up, brings the ball forward in the middle of the park . It should have been five on the hour when again Spain got down the Macedonia right with Silva pulling the ball back to Fabregas who smashed his shot against the bar. Fabregas was now sharing false-nine responsibilities with substitute Isco who had replaced goal hero Albacar – this really was the old Spain, playing without a recognised No 9. Pedro was the next to find himself in centre-forward space but he pulled his shot wide after being played in by Fabregas. He finally got in on the act in injury time with a fine finish from a Silva pass. With 10 minutes left Spain had brought on Munir El Haddadi for his debut aged just 19 years and seven days. The Barcelona striker has a Spanish mother and Moroccan father and was playing in the level below Barça’s B-team last season. His cameo and the performances of Alcacer show that Spain have plenty left in the locker as they look to defend their Euro crown. What remains to be seen is how Chelsea’s Costa fits into Del Bosque’s brave new world. Making sure: Sergio Busquets accepts the congratulations of Fabregas after he made it 3-1 in the closing stages of the first half in Valencia . Gesture: Busquets celebrates his goal with a hand sign after putting Spain back in charge in this Group C qualifying opener for the European champions . Spanish sensation: Manchester City playmaker Silva points to the sky after his smart finish made it four for the home side in the second half .

"A 14-year-old Colorado boy will spend 10 years behind bars after pleading guilty to killing his father and trying to conceal the slaying for six days by keeping the body at home and telling the man's employer he was sick. The boy, who was identified by local news outlets as Kai Kelly, entered the plea Tuesday under a deal with prosecutors and will be sentenced Thursday, The Vail Daily reported. He will serve seven years in youth prison before entering adult prison on his 21st birthday to serve the last three years of his sentence.

Prison: A 13-year-old boy from Gypsum, Colorado (not pictured) will serve 10 years in prison - seven in a youth facility followed by three in an adult one - after pleading guilty to the murder of his 50-year-old father . The father didn't show up for the meeting or work. The son called his father's boss for several days to say he was sick, but the employer became suspicious and alerted authorities. When deputies arrived at the home, the boy answered the door and told them his father was dead inside. During Tuesday's court hearing, the teen sat quietly and answered questions from Judge Fred Gannett to make sure the teen knew to what he was agreeing. After the proceedings, the boy smiled softly when his mother, who was divorced from the father, was allowed to sit beside him at the defendant's table to talk before he was taken back into detention.

"The Voyager 1 spacecraft is still riding a massive 'tsunami wave' that first began in February, Nasa has revealed. It is the longest-lasting shock wave that researchers have seen in interstellar space. Experts say the find is making them rethink how the 'end of space' works. The Voyager 1 spacecraft has been riding the same 'tsunami wave' since February, baffling researchers . It is 37 years since the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft were launched and the pair continue to explore where nothing from Earth has flown before. Their primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn. After making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io and intricacies of Saturn's rings -- the mission was extended. Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets. The current mission for both spacecraft, the Voyager Interstellar Mission, is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond. The 'tsunami wave' is still propagating outward, according to the new results. It is the longest-lasting shock wave that researchers have seen in interstellar space. 'Most people would have thought the interstellar medium would have been smooth and quiet. But these shock waves seem to be more common than we thought,' said Don Gurnett, professor of physics at the University of Iowa. He presented the new data at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco. A 'tsunami wave' occurs when the sun emits a coronal mass ejection, throwing out a magnetic cloud of plasma from its surface. This generates a wave of pressure. When the wave runs into the interstellar plasma - the charged particles found in the space between the stars - a shock wave results that perturbs the plasma and causes in to 'sing'. 'The tsunami causes the ionized gas that is out there to resonate -- 'sing' or vibrate like a bell,' said Ed Stone, project scientist for the Voyager mission based at California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. This is the third shock wave that Voyager 1 has experienced. The first event was in October to November of 2012, and the second wave in April to May of 2013 revealed an even higher plasma density. Voyager 1 detected the most recent event in February, and it is still going on as of November data. The spacecraft has moved outward 250 million miles (400 million kilometers) during the third event. 'This remarkable event raises questions that will stimulate new studies of the nature of shocks in the interstellar medium,' said Leonard Burlaga, astrophysicist emeritus at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who analyzed the magnetic field data that were key to these results. A 'tsunami wave' occurs when the sun emits a coronal mass ejection, throwing out a magnetic cloud of plasma from its surface. This generates a wave of pressure. When the wave runs into the interstellar plasma - the charged particles found in the space between the stars - a shock wave results that perturbs the plasma. It is unclear to researchers what the unusual longevity of this particular wave may mean. They are also uncertain as to how fast the wave is moving or how broad a region it covers. The second tsunami wave helped researchers determine in 2013 that Voyager 1 had left the heliosphere, the bubble created by the solar wind encompassing the sun and the planets in our solar system. Denser plasma 'rings' at a higher frequency, and the medium that Voyager flew through, was 40 times denser than what had been previously measured. This was key to the conclusion that Voyager had entered a frontier where no spacecraft had gone before: interstellar space. 'The density of the plasma is higher the farther Voyager goes,' Stone said. 'Is that because the interstellar medium is denser as Voyager moves away from the heliosphere, or is it from the shock wave itself? We don't know yet.' The heliosphere, in which the Sun and planets reside, is a large bubble inflated from the inside by the high-speed solar wind blowing out from the Sun. Pressure from the solar wind, along with pressure from the surrounding interstellar medium, determines the size and shape of the heliosphere.

Pressure from the solar wind, along with pressure from the surrounding interstellar medium, determines the size and shape of the heliosphere. The supersonic flow of solar wind abruptly slows at the termination shock, the innermost boundary of the solar system. The edge of the solar system is the heliopause. The bow shock pushes ahead through the interstellar medium as the heliosphere plows through the galaxy.

The bow shock pushes ahead through the interstellar medium as the heliosphere plows through the galaxy. Gurnett, principal investigator of the plasma wave instrument on Voyager, expects that such shock waves propagate far out into space, perhaps even to twice the distance between the sun and where the spacecraft is right now. Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, were launched 16 days apart in 1977. Both spacecraft flew by Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 also flew by Uranus and Neptune. Voyager 2, launched before Voyager 1, is the longest continuously operated spacecraft and is expected to enter interstellar space in a few years. JPL, a division of Caltech, built the twin Voyager spacecraft and operates them for the Heliophysics Division within NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.","Spacecraft still riding massive 'tsunami wave' that first began in February .

"In times past, they would have carried greetings of goodwill amid peaceful Yuletide scenes. But the Christmas cards of today are just as likely to sport obscene, offensive or even anti-Christian messages. The main offender is the stationery chain Scribbler which stocks the explicit cards in full view of children. Shoppers using the firm’s website are also offered a range of the festive cards carrying four-letter expletives and images of sex acts. Scroll down for video . Offensive: Two of the Scribbler cards with the profanities obscured . One carries the slogan: ‘Ho Ho Ho Mother F*****’; a second features Father Christmas under the slogan ‘Merry Kiss My A**’; a third says on the front: ‘This Christmas Treat Yourself to some A***’. Others mock Jesus, putting him in what seems to be a ‘selfie’ pose with the slogan: ‘It’s all about me’. Another showing Jesus with his disciples says: ‘It’s my birthday and I want a pony’. Family and Christian campaigners said the cards were an insult. The Christmas cards of today sport obscene and offensive messages . The cards featuring explicit messages are stocked within full view of children in High Street stores . Childs Eyes UK, which campaigns against sexual and violent images, says it is 'not appropriate' for children to see cards using this language . Norman Wells of the Family Education Trust said: ‘Crude and offensive greetings cards have no place in high street stores. ‘Parents should be able to shop with their children without being confronted by products that are calculated to cause embarrassment or offence. ‘Some of the cards reflect a deep-seated prejudice against Christianity. It is hard to imagine such blasphemous and sacrilegious sentiments being tolerated if they were targeted at any other religion.’ Kathy McGuinness, of Childs Eyes UK, which campaigns against sexual and violent images, said: ‘Our concern is for what children see, but a lot of adults and Christians would find these cards and images offensive. ‘It is not appropriate for children, if you look at the language the firm is using. We have a broadcasting watershed on TV. ‘We have to be very careful about making jokes about other religions, but when it comes to Christianity it seems to be open season.’ Andrea Minichiello Williams of Christian Concern said: ‘Let’s hope that people vote with their pocket and that Scribbler gets left with stockpiles of cards that it can’t sell.’ John Proctor, who owns the Scribbler chain, defended the card displays, saying they appealed to younger adult customers. ‘It is all a question of one’s own standards and viewpoint,’ he said. ‘There should be humour in religion. I know our local vicar finds a lot of the cards that we sell are amusing. I don’t think the fact that someone has a particular religious inclination, feeling or faith should preclude humour.’ 'Parents should be able to shop with their children without being confronted by these products, ' said Normans Wells of the Family Education Trust . Christian Concern has said they hope people'vote with their feet' and leave stores with stockpiles of cards . John Proctor, who owns Scribbler, defended the displays and said the cards were popular with young adults . Asked, if he would treat the Muslim faith and its icons in the same way, Mr Proctor said: ‘No, we wouldn’t. I would feel there is less humour in those religions. I wouldn’t even go there. I have no understanding of that faith and feel I am stepping completely out of my comfort zone. That would be a really silly thing to be doing.’ Mr Proctor, who founded Scribbler with wife Jennie in 1981, said the chain put the explicit cards on higher shelves. But a snapshot of stores in London yesterday found the offensive cards were on lower shelves with warning signs hard to spot. The Proctors have a £1.5million thatched home in Dorset and a luxury central London address for the weekdays they spend working. They have three grown-up children, enjoy a succession of exotic holidays and ferry themselves around by Porsche, Jeep, and even a powerboat. The chain has 29 stores nationwide.","Cards sport obscene, offensive and even anti-Christian messages .

"FIFA referees chief Massimo Busacca has come to the defence of under-fire official Yuichi Nishimura and said it was 'a fantasy' to suggest he had favoured hosts Brazil. The fall-out from the World Cup opening game's high-profile refereeing blunder continued on Friday with Croatia's players questioning the appointment of the Japanese official for the match against hosts Brazil. Nishimura awarded a penalty against Dejan Lovren despite the Southampton defender barely touching Brazil striker Fred - the scores were 1-1 at the time and Brazil went on to win 3-1. Controversial: Referee Yuichi Nishimura has been criticised for his performance during the World Cup opener . Angry: Croatia were not happy with the referee's officiating of their 3-1 loss against hosts Brazil . Busacca insisted there had been some contact between Lovren and Fred even if it was minimal. He told a news conference in Rio De Janeiro: 'You think about the decision, you don't have time to think 'ah, but I am in Brazil'. A human cannot think four times in one second. 'This is fantasy. I am sorry to say this, but this is fantasy. 'We have to believe the referees are honest, and respect them. Maybe there will be mistakes, but we must respect them. 'In refereeing, we have black and white but we also have cases that can be on the borderline. 'Yesterday, we can discuss; was it enough (contact)? Yes or no? 'On the pitch, the referee takes a decision in less than one second. He is concentrated on the gesture and when you see the hands doing something, it's difficult to arrive at one conclusion. 'The left hand touched and then also the right. If you play with the hands out, the referee sees that clearly and decides one way.' Thierry Weil, FIFA's marketing director, also rejected suggestions of bias. Stunned: Luke Modric (right) argues with referee Nishimura during their World Cup opener against the hosts . In response to a question, he said: 'You are pretending something I cannot accept. You are pretending FIFA is helping the home country, and that is not even the case. 'FIFA has nothing to favour the home country. We are here to make the tournament good.' Such a controversy was the last thing that World Cup organisers wanted - and will fuel calls for FIFA president Sepp Blatter's proposal for challenges via TV replays to be approved. FA general secretary Alex Horne, a board member of the International FA Board which rules on law changes, had said hours before the Brazil v Croatia match in Sao Paulo that a high-profile blunder could provide impetus for Blatter's proposal for managers to be allowed two challenges a match. Harsh: Croatia feel the officials were harsher on them than hosts Brazil, perhaps due to the atmosphere . Right or wrong? Neymar could easily have seen red for a wild elbow during their win against Croatia . Horne told Press Association Sport: 'Don't underestimate the power of circumstance. If we get something happening in the next three or four weeks that is blindingly obvious - like Frank Lampard's 'goal that wasn't a goal' in Bloemfontein - then that could give this real momentum.' Nishimura is an experienced referee who was fourth official for the 2010 final, but Croatia's former . Tottenham defender Vedran Corluka questioned why he was appointed for this game, claiming no one could understand him - though it is a requirement for World Cup referees to speak English. Corluka said: 'I never saw in my life that a referee doesn't speak English. He was speaking something in Japanese but no one could understand him. 'The decision to award the penalty was embarrassing and it changed the game.' Croatia coach Niko Kovac said Nishimura had been 'out of his depth' and Lovren added that if the hosts Brazil were to be favoured in such a way the organisers could just award the trophy to them now. He said: 'Of course I am angry. I wanted to cry but what can you do? If it is like this, then you can give the World Cup directly to Brazil.' Croatia face Cameroon in Manaus on Wednesday in their next Group A match.

"Unmasked: Blogger Robert Ambridge (Old Holborn) has used Twitter for a series of vile comments . This is the face of one of Britain’s most notorious internet trolls. As his alter ego Old Holborn, Robert Ambridge is responsible for a series of vile and offensive Twitter posts that have brought him death threats. Thousands were outraged when Ambridge, who appears on his Twitter page with his identity disguised by a plastic pig mask, tweeted about the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. He posted a picture of two overweight women and claimed ‘this is what crushed the 96’. Ambridge, 51, a recruitment consultant and father of six from Braintree, Essex, also made disgusting comments about the murder of James Bulger which deeply upset his mother. But an unrepentant Ambridge claims people who are offended by his comments have only themselves to blame. ‘It is not my responsibility what other people find upsetting. I didn’t target anyone. I didn’t send an email. They chose to read what I wrote. If they don’t like it, they should turn it off. I don’t care what people find offensive.’ Justifying his tweet about Hillsborough, he added: ‘This is dark humour. People might not like my humour but I think it is funny and it gets a chuckle.’ This week, the self-proclaimed ‘satirical terrorist’ will seek to justify his vitriolic internet posts in an ITV documentary called Fear And Loathing Online. Ambridge agreed to be filmed without his pig mask, although his face was not shown. But The Mail on  Sunday traced Ambridge to his dilapidated Victorian home in Braintree. With an appearance more akin to Coronation Street’s hapless cafe owner Roy Cropper than a cutting-edge satirist, he initially denied he was Old Holborn. Masking his identity: How he appears on Twitter . But later, speaking at the wheel of his battered Toyota vehicle, gap-toothed Ambridge said: ‘I am there to upset the apple cart. It is a form of entertainment. Trolling is like putting a fishing line in a shoal of fish and seeing what you can get.’ Ambridge worked for Alchemy Recruitment in Braintree until April, when he was first outed as a notorious online troll. Following his Hillsborough comments, people bombarded the firm with phone calls and threatened to burn down its offices. An investigation was launched by Essex Police over tweets relating to the Boston bombing, as well as the Hillsborough disaster and the Bulger murder. Ambridge has since left the company. Police said the CPS is considering whether to pursue a case of criminal communication through social media involving a 51-year-old man from Braintree.Fear and Loathing Online,  ITV, Thursday at 7.30pm.","Robert Ambridge unveiled as man behind 'Old Holborn' Twitter account .

"He's the most famous British spy ever, whose iconic role can define an actor's entire career. And while the likes of Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore will forever be remembered for playing James Bond, there will always be those who narrowly missed the cut as 007. But a newly-revealed photo archive has given a fascinating insight into the men who just failed to land the part as the smooth-talking Secret Agent. The final five: Hans De Vries, Anthony Rogers (top row, left and right), . along with John Richardson and Robert Campbell (bottom row, left and . centre), all failed to land the James Bond role ahead of one-time 007 . George Lazenby (bottom right) Pictures from 1967 show five actors in a casting session for the Bond film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, where the lead role eventually went to George Lazenby. The Australian actor, succeeding Sean Connery who had just given up the role, landed the lead part in what would be his only Bond appearance. The history of the iconic spy franchise could have been very different, however, if one of the four other aspiring Bonds had landed the coveted main role. Ladies man: John Richardson, a British actor then in his mid-30s, in a casting session for On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which was released in 1969 . Licence to thrill: Anthony Rogers, who had previously appeared in Doctor Who and El Dorado, also tried out for the iconic spy role . Shaken not stirred: Robert Campbell, who faded into complete obscurity after his failed audition, tries his best to channel Bond in this casting session picture . The photos taken for LIFE magazine in . 1967 show aspiring Bonds suiting up, brandishing weapons, sipping 007's . trademark martini and charming beautiful women in his own inimitable . style. Among them is British . actor John Richardson, who is pictured facing a gun from his female . co-star in a typically 'Bond' scenario. Leading man: George Lazenby, pictured with actress Gundel Sargeant, eventually landed the lead role for his only Bond appearance . Other fascinating images show another hopeful, Anthony Rogers, alongside a love interest as he did his best to land the part of the suave spy. The third nearly-man is Robert Campbell, who competed for the role by screen testing in a trademark Bond kissing scene with a female co-star. Lastly is Hans de Vries, who, just like the others who failed to land the part, faded into relative acting obscurity following his rejection. Richardson, a British actor then in his mid-30s who had considerable film experience, was considered to be Lazenby's main rival for the role, but narrowly missed out. The actor, now 78, appears to have taken the rejection in his stride, as he went on to appear in dozens of film in an acting career which spanned until 1994. The same cannot be said for Rogers and Campbell, however. The former had a recurring role in Doctor Who and later El Dorado in 1966, but his acting career stalled after his failed Bond audition. Campbell meanwhile, appears even more . of an enigma, as virtually no information appears to exist about his . acting credentials at all, other than his relation to brother William . Campbell, the prolific TV actor. De .

"For many, it was the original social network. Bebo, which was a huge hit, was sold to AOL in 2008 for $850m - before sinking without a trace as Facebook became to world's biggest social network. Now, the husband and wife team who originally founded it have relaunched it, after buying back the domain name for $1m. Scroll down for video . Bebo promises 'chat with attitude', and its founder claims the social network is 'all about the banter' Bebo was launched in 2005. Users could upload blogs, photos, music and videos to their pages. Bebo, alongside MySpace was one of the contenders to Facebook in the early 2000s. At its peak it had about 40 million users. It was sold by Michael and Xochi Birch to AOL for $850 million in 2008. Bebo was eclipsed by Facebook as well as other social networking sites such as Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr. AOL's reluctance to invest in the site has been blamed for its decline. Bebo sought bankruptcy protection in 2013 and Mr Birch bought the company from its receivers for $1 million. At its height in 2008, Bebo saw over 1 billion page views a week. Now, it is available as an iOS and Android app, with a web version coming soon. 'When we decided to come back we wanted to make something people would use,' Shaan Puri, the CEO of Bebo, told MailOnline. He runs the site for Michael and Xochi Birch, the couple who founded it in 2005, and who bought the domain name back. 'A lot of casual conversation is about banter - so we came up with the idea based around that.' When users first sign up, they create their own avatars which are their 'face' on the network. Using hashtags, they can be made to change their expression, for instance. Other hashtags can show a map, play music or even launch games on the site. 'Michael decided to use hashtags, to allow people to make their character do things - you can slap friends, or even play a game, or send a song,' said Puri. The firm plans to add extra features to the app over time. 'People will discover them in the network- people tell their friends as we release new features using hashtags.' He also took aim at other social networks that sell packs of emojis or stickers to users. The original Bebo: At its height in 2008, Bebo saw over 1 billion page views a week . 'Unlike an Emoji, you don't have to go buy new packs - and we can have a hashtag up in seconds.' The new site is also aimed at users of the original. 'It was a place to have fun with friends, and we hope those same things will carry on. 'This has got to be more fun - it's not about using us over twitter, we think people will use both for different sets of people. 'But with your best mates, we hope you'll be on Bebo.' Bebo, which stands for 'Blog Early, Blog Often,' was founded in 2005 and in its hey day had some 40 million users around the world. Bebo was founded by husband and wife team Michael and Xochi Birch, who met as students while both at Imperial College in London. Set up in 2005, after several previous start-ups, it became vast, boasting more than 10 million users before the pair sold it to AOL for a staggering $850 million, of which the Birches pocketed $595 million. Two years after the internet giant bought the social network, private equity form Criterion Capital Partners tried to revive it for less than $10 million but failed, before the Birches were able to buy it back. As well as resurrecting Bebo, the pair have become angel investors, helping young start-ups get their first step on the online ladder, and Michael is also heavily involved in PROfounders, a London venture capital firm that invests heavily in the capital’s startups. They now also run a software 'incubator' called Monkey Inferno in San Francisco, along with a private members club called The Battery. Earlier this yearhe Californian-based couple have now snapped up the the Farmers Arms pub in Woolsery, Devon, and have vowed to restore it to its former glory. The firm also said it hoped to bring back photos from the old site. 'It's taken a bit of engineering, but by 31 January we will have your photos available for download,' it said.

"President Barack Obama is marking the 44th Earth Day with a carbon-emitting extravaganza, spending more than 15 hours on Air Force One and 15 minutes aboard the Marine One helicopter. Not including his motorcades in Oso, Washington, the site of a recent devastating mudslide, his trip will consume an estimated 35,565 gallons of fuel. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the statistics arm of the Department of Energy, burning each gallon emits 21.1 pounds of carbon dioxide, bringing the president's Earth Day carbon footprint to more than 375.7 tons. The White House did not respond to a question about any measures it might be taking – planting trees, for instance – to offset those emissions. President Barack Obama boarded Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base on Tuesday, en route to the state of Washington to visit with family members of victims of the deadly March 22 mudslide, and then on to Tokyo, Japan to meet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe . Air Force One, the president's private Boeing 747, burns about 5 gallons of jet fuel per minute, a rate that would have the typical car stranded halfway to the grocery store . Boeing's specifications for its 747 aircraft, which serves as Air Force One, include an estimate for fuel consumption of 5 gallons per mile. Tuesday's presidential travel will span more than 7,100 miles over two continents.– more than one-quarter of the way around the earth. Sikorsky, whose HV-3d Sea King helicopter flew Obama from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base, burns an additional 176.7 gallons of fuel per hour, requiring more than 44 gallons – about four times the size of a modern economy car's fuel tank – for the estimated 15-minute trip. A White House pool reporter noted that Marine One' landing on the South Lawn of the White House 'caused a flurry of hundreds of tree flower petals.' Mid-morning Tuesday, the White House issued a sweeping online essay calling for renewed awareness of threats from global warming. 'Our health, our economy, our security, and our planet’s future are once again threatened by pollution and environmental degradation,' the White House's official blog claimed. Warning: 'Our health, our economy, our security, and our planet¿s future are once again threatened by pollution and environmental degradation', the White said on its blog today . 'Our climate is changing, and that change is being driven by human activity. Every year, the United States pumps millions of tons of carbon dioxide pollution and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.' 'Earth Day is about taking action,' the White House declared. Obama's trip will have more than an environmental cost, draining $228,288 from the taxpayer-funded U.S. Treasury for every hour it's in the air. The Air Force's estimate brings the president's airfare to $3.47 million. The United States ranks 12th in the world among all nations for per capita carbon dioxide emissions. Obama is visiting the town of Oso, Washington, the site of a deadly March 22 mudslide. He will meet with victims' families as well as first responders. His trip to Tokyo will include a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and a visit with the nation's emperor and empress.","President took Marine One chopper to Andrews Air Force Base and will fly to Washington state and Tokyo, Japan on Tuesday .

"Foreign students are illegally working for five-figure salaries and claiming benefits, as well as pretending to attend courses that have no teachers. Posed by models . The ongoing ‘significant abuse’ of Britain’s border controls by bogus students was revealed in government papers last night. Foreign students are illegally working for five-figure salaries and claiming benefits, as well as pretending to attend courses that have no teachers. But a detailed Home Office blitz planned by Theresa May against the migrants and their colleges is being blocked by Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats. The revelations will further fuel the row between the two sides of the Coalition over the need to get a firmer grip on Britain’s borders. A leaked Cabinet letter written by the Home Secretary reveals that, despite a concerted government crackdown on bogus  colleges, ‘abuse of the system has evolved, not disappeared’. At a single college, 397 students with no right to work in Britain were caught earning more than £20,000 a year – potentially depriving Britons of a job. This suggests that, nationwide, thousands of students may be guilty of working illegally. At the same private college 62 students were found to be wrongly pocketing benefits. Investigators also discovered that one college claimed it had 50 students but only 18 were attending classes. It had recruited 70 more to study at a campus that has no teachers. Students were regularly found to be . living too far away to attend their courses. One college in Manchester . had enrolled youngsters who claimed to be commuting from Northern . Ireland. A detailed Home Office blitz planned by Theresa May against the migrants and their colleges is being blocked by Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats . In a letter seen by the Mail, Mrs May warned the Deputy Prime  Minister that ‘we need to take  decisive action to protect the integrity of the system and the reputation of our education sector’. She outlined a string of detailed policy proposals requiring Mr Clegg’s approval. These include banning  foreign students from bringing their dependants with them unless they are studying for two years or more. The move would lead to thousands fewer migrants being allowed to bring over wives, partners and children. It comes amid evidence that, to help applicants bypass border checks,  universities routinely classify almost all one-year academic courses as lasting 12 months or slightly longer. Under the current rules, this allows them to bring dependants to Britain. Other plans include making it easier to strip universities of the right to bring in lucrative foreign students if they flout the rules. Universities and colleges would also be required to work with immigration officers to provide intelligence on students who had overstayed their visas. A pilot scheme at Portsmouth and Southampton Universities has led to 30 students who had remained in  Britain illegally leaving the country. Theresa May has outlined a string of detailed policy proposals requiring Nick Clegg's approval. These include banning  foreign students from bringing their dependants with them unless they are studying for two years or more (file picture) But Mr Clegg and other Lib Dems are blocking the proposals, which are now locked in Cabinet stalemate. The party has repeatedly attempted to water down controls on foreign students. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable considers the  students to be vital to the success of the education sector. Mrs May’s letter makes clear that widespread abuse continues, despite the Government stripping dozens of colleges of their licences since 2010. The four-page letter, dated February 19, states: ‘We have ended the industrial scale abuse of our student visa system while protecting our world-class universities. ‘[But] our ongoing work has uncovered evidence of significant abuse of the student route by institutions acting negligently or deliberately.’ Mrs May’s plan to make it easier to remove the licences of colleges that sponsor bogus students is proving particularly contentious. Under existing rules higher education providers keep their ‘trusted status’ even if 20 per cent of their students are later rejected by the Home Office because officials do not think they are genuine. Mrs May wants to cut this threshold to 10 per cent. There are 1,700 education institutions with highly trusted status. Around 105 have between 10 and 20 per cent of students rejected. Of those, around 70 are colleges and the remainder include independent schools and universities.","Home Office blitz against migrants and their colleges is being blocked by .

"The crucial role played by Pope Francis in bringing Cuba and the United States together signals that history's first Latin American pope has no qualms about putting the Holy See on the front lines of diplomacy, especially for a cause it has long championed. The Vatican said on Wednesday that Francis wrote to President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro in recent months and invited them to resolve their differences over humanitarian issues, including prisoners. In addition, the Vatican hosted U.S. and Cuban delegations in October 'and provided its good offices to facilitate a constructive dialogue on delicate matters, resulting in solutions acceptable to both parties,' the Vatican said. Scroll down for video . Birthday boy: Pope Francis is presented with a cake during his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican on Wednesday on the same day the US and Cuba left their differences behind them . In his announcement, Obama referred twice to Francis and thanked him for his involvement, saying his 'moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be, rather than simply settling for the world as it is.' Indeed, Francis has shown he is willing to use his popularity and moral authority to do the unthinkable for a good cause. This past June he invited the Israeli and Palestinian presidents for a day of peace prayers at the Vatican, and before that agreed to requests to help facilitate talks between the Venezuelan government and opponents. Such Holy See interventionism harks back to the papacy of St. John Paul II, who is credited with having helped bring down communism in his native Poland by encouraging the Solidarity movement. John Paul in 1978 also sent an envoy to help Francis' native Argentina and Chile reach a compromise on a territorial dispute. The two countries had been on the brink of war over the Beagle Channel and its islands. The Vatican under Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI kept a low diplomatic profile, but during his 2012 visit to Cuba, Benedict voiced the Vatican's long-standing position that it believed the U.S. embargo was unjust and only hurt the most vulnerable on the island. 'Cuba and the world need change, but this will occur only if each one is in a position to seek the truth and chooses the way of love, sowing reconciliation and fraternity,' Benedict said. No more fire: Pope Francis blows candles on a cake during his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican on Wednesday on the same day that the US will restore full diplomatic relations with Cuba . The remark built upon the famed call of John Paul who said in his groundbreaking 1998 visit that Cuba should 'open itself up to the world, and may the world open itself up to Cuba.' U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See, Kenneth Hackett, said in a statement to The Associated Press that a senior Vatican official had met with both sides 'to help bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion.' He didn't name the official. Francis' top diplomat is Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, until last year the Vatican's ambassador to Caracas. Given his experience in the Caribbean, Parolin's role in the U.S.-Cuba rapprochement was believed to have been crucial to the deal. The archbishop of Miami, Thomas Wenski, said that in bringing the two sides together, Francis did what popes are suppposed to do: 'build bridges and promote peace.' 'The church in Cuba has always opposed the embargo, arguing that it was a blunt instrument that hurt the innocent more than the guilty,'Wenski said on Wednesday. 'And the U.S. church has supported the Catholic Church in Cuba.' Elisabetta Pique, an Argentine journalist and author of the authoritative biography 'Pope Francis, Life and Revolution,' said Francis had long been concerned about the effects of the U.S.-Cuba estrangement, given his position as a prominent churchman in Latin America. He frequently stressed the need for cultural engagement and dialogue. She said it was widely understood that Francis and Obama spoke about Cuba when they met March 27 at the Vatican. 'It's typical of the man to have the courage to intervene personally, trying to contribute to doing something concrete, as we saw him do with the Mideast (prayer summit), without being afraid to take the risk,' she told The Associated Press. Perhaps coincidentally, the announcement was made on Francis' 78th birthday, and Vatican officials had said to expect a 'surprise' later in the day. Most reporters suspected he might invite some homeless people to dinner, not announce his personal involvement in a historic diplomatic breakthrough.","Pope Francis wrote to President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro in recent months and invited them to resolve their differences .

"Luis Suarez will be reunited with his former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish on Wednesday as Liverpool’s most famous No 7 hands the Golden Shoe over to the man who wore the shirt for two-and-a-half seasons at Liverpool. As soon as the afternoon ceremony in Barcelona is over Suarez will return to his rented home in Gava where he lives with his family in the same neighbourhood as coach Luis Enrique and team-mate Javier Mascherano. He will spend two days playing his usual secondary part in training sessions at Barcelona’s Joan Gamper headquarters knowing that he will not be part of preparations for Saturday’s game against Eibar which he will watch from high in the Nou Camp and then it will finally be over. Luis Suarez has had to play a waiting game since joining Barcelona from Liverpool in the summer . Kenny Dalglish - here with Suarez as his Liverpool manager in October 2011 - will present the Golden Shoe . The four-month ban issued by FIFA for the bite on Giorgio Chiellini will not be officially over until another six days but on Sunday morning Suarez will take full part in first-team training as Barcelona begin preparation for the trip to Real Madrid on October 25 – a game that he is expected to start. It will have been 123 days since out of competitive football. 'The first two months were the worst,' he says in reference to the eight weeks he spent unable to train with team-mates or set foot in the Nou Camp. 'I was in a little gym about 10-metre squared with a personal trainer. I had to stay out of the way. I couldn’t be photographed,' he says speaking to FC Barcelona’s in-house media. 'It was tough but I was conscious of the fact that I had to do it for my own good. I had a serious knee injury before the World Cup and only just made it back. All I kept thinking about was that I wanted to be at the same fitness level as my team-mates once I was allowed to start training with them.' Suarez feigns injury after infamously biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup . When his ban on all football activity was lifted by the court of arbitration in sport on August 14, work could really begin on his comeback and the gruelling one-on-one training sessions with Barca fitness coach Juanjo Brau could begin in earnest. Off the pitch he finally moved out of his Liverpool home, vacating the house he took over from Fernando Torres and that now currently awaits its next famous footballing tenant. He moved his family briefly into his his wife’s parents’ house in the Barcelona coastal town of Castelldefels and then to nearby Gava where daughter Delfina was soon enrolled into the same British school as the children of his manager Luis Enrique and team-mate Mascherano. On the pitch a behind-closed-doors friendly with the B-team was followed by a specially organised match against an Indonesian Under 19 XI in which he scored twice and passed up on the chance to complete his hat-trick from the spot so that the B-team’s pre-designated spot-kick taker could score. Suarez scores past Oman goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi on international duty for Uruguay this week . It’s not quite Mario Balotelli asking if he could become Liverpool’s penalty taker when signing his contract at Anfield this summer – Suarez has won the instant respect of his new team-mates by the way he has fitted in patiently waiting for October 25 to come. After that league comeback he will play his first Champions League game in the Amsterdam ArenA against Ajax, the only side he has represented in the competition so far in his career, and the team he captained aged 22. 'There are a lot of coincidences,' he says. 'Going back after so long is going to be special.' Fitting in to life in his new home city has been made easier by his in-laws having lived there for the last 11 years. They know Barcelona well as does Suarez's wife Sofia who lived in the Catalan capital until moving to Holland to live with Suarez. Suarez shows off his Barcelona shirt after finally being allowed to be unveiled back in August . VIDEO Suarez scores a brace for Barca B . On the training ground Mascherano and Lionel Messi have become drinking buddies for Suarez – all enjoying the traditional bitter green herb Maté sucked from a metal straw and passed between friends. If the connection with Messi is as good on the pitch as it off it then Barcelona’s rivals could have problems. Real Madrid hope the three take their time to click into place. Suarez looked predictably lacking in match sharpness in a series of three friendlies played for Barça and Uruguay. But he also looked a long way from the ""overweight ex-footballer"" description given him by the pro-Madrid media. 'They are running scared of the Suarez, Messi, Neymar forward line,' responded the Catalan press to jibes. Barcelona supporters are hopeful the precedent of last season will mean he makes an instant impact on his return. After serving his 10-game ban for biting Branislav Ivanovic Suarez scored twice in his first match back against Sunderland. Suarez trains with his new Barcelona team-mates after having his ban reduced . And there is another older precedent: Johan Cruyff also had a delayed debut for Barcelona after signing from Ajax in August 1973 for 120m pesetas (just over half a million pounds). A bureaucratic problem meant the team had already played the first seven fixtures before the paperwork was in order and Cruyff could play in a 4-0 win over Granada. The Dutchman scored twice in his first match. Now it’s over to Suarez who on Wednesday becomes the fifth winner of the Golden Shoe that Barcelona have signed. Hans Krankl won a European Cup Winners Cup after signing and Hristo Stoitchov, Thierry Henry and Henrik Larsson all won the Champions League with Barca. The bar is set high but that is the way Suarez wants it. The quest for trophies is about to begin.","Luis Suarez set for Barcelona debut next weekend against Real Madrid .

"With a full head of ringlets, a dash of period-appropriate make-up and a darling hat, it has to be admitted that Eddie Redmayne makes an adorable young woman. Indeed, the actor — strongly tipped for an Oscar next year for his performance as physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything — spent much of his teens in female roles. He explains that as a pupil at all-boys’ school Eton, it was necessary for some boys to take the female roles in drama productions. And it is no surprise to learn that Eddie — full-lipped, with high cheekbones, delicate features and a stardust sprinkling of freckles — was often chosen to trip prettily across the gender divide. Scroll down for video . Eddie Redmayne  is strongly tipped for an Oscar next year for his performance in his new film The Theory of Everything . Photos of him playing Viola in Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night — a girl dressed as a boy, played by a boy actor in the Bard’s day — show he is undeniably beautiful. Indeed, one national newspaper critic who reviewed the production gushed that Redmayne was ‘scandalously persuasive as Viola’ in this all-male production and ‘would bring out the bisexual in any man’. Equally floridly, the play’s director, Tim Carroll, observed that the young actor was ‘quite troublingly beautiful’. As luck would have it, this cross-dressing performance was Redmayne’s big break. Having excelled at drama at Eton — where he was a contemporary of Prince William and regarded him as a ‘mate’ — he went on to Trinity College, Cambridge, on a choral scholarship. Redmayne pictured playing Viola in an all-male production of Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night. The director described him as 'quite troublingly beautiful' Two years into his history of art degree, he was contacted by his Eton drama master and asked to audition for the role of Viola in a production at London’s Globe Theatre. Aged only 20, he got the part and starred opposite the brilliant Mark Rylance — managing to counter the established actor’s scene-stealing tendencies with a performance of remarkable freshness and intelligence. There was an immediate bidding war between various London agents who were keen to sign Redmayne. Leading theatre and film roles followed, notably in the film musical of Les Miserables and My Week With Marilyn (about Laurence Olivier’s troubled relationship with Monroe), plus a stint as one of the faces of fashion label Burberry. Redmayne and Hannah Bagshawe were introduced by one of his siblings and are reported to have wed in a secret ceremony on Monday . Now, at 32, he is hot property on an international scale, and on the verge of A-list status. He is also — to general heartbreak — just married to his long-term girlfriend, Hannah Bagshawe, an antiques dealer. On Monday, the couple tied the knot at Babington House, a private members’ club in Somerset. They are rumoured to have had the venue turned into a ‘winter wonderland’ with fake snow. It is certainly an eventful time for Redmayne. Last week, he was nominated as Best Actor in the Golden Globes — a sure-fire indication that he will be in the running for an Oscar in February. Eddie Redmayne has been linked to various high profile celebrities such as Carey Mulligan but the Les Miserables actor married antiques dealer Hannah Bagshawe  this week . The critics are drooling over him — with his performance as a young Stephen Hawking described as ‘mesmerising’ (The Theory Of Everything is set for release here on New Year’s Day). So, what makes Edward Redmayne such movie gold dust? Born in 1982, one of five sporty, academic and accomplished children, Eddie was raised in considerable privilege. Home was a magnificent pile overlooking the Thames on London’s Chelsea Embankment. Although his parents were not in showbusiness (his father is a successful banker), he had drama lessons and, aged 12, played an urchin in a West End production of Oliver! He wanted to go to drama school, but his parents persuaded him to go to university first. To his credit, he has never tried to play down his moneyed roots, nor has he been the target of much of the criticism of ‘over-privilege’ that has been directed at fellow posh boy actor Benedict Cumberbatch. Unlike fellow actor Benedict Cumberbatch,  Redmayne has never been the target of criticism regarding his privileged upbringing . ‘Do I feel posh? Well, I suppose,’ Redmayne once said. ‘I went to Eton. I also went to Cambridge. So, yes, I definitely come from a privileged background. But I have lots of friends from different walks of life.’ And explaining why there seems to be a disproportionate number of actors from upper-crust backgrounds (Tom Hiddleston, who plays Loki in the Thor films, Homeland’s Damian Lewis and The Wire’s Dominic West are also Old Etonians), Redmayne has pointed to fee-paying schools’ superior facilities. An inspirational drama teacher was also a huge influence. Simon Dormandy, known as ‘Dormo’ to the boys, chose Redmayne for a leading role in his first school production — a version of E. M. Forster’s A Passage To India. Next, he played Henry VI. Redmayne (left) with Romola Garai (centre) and Simon Dormandy (right), started in the acting business aged 12, playing an urchin in a West End production of Oliver! Dormandy recalled: ‘I knew as soon as I met [Eddie] that he was exceptionally gifted. He was able and happy to be very raw. That remains part of the essence of why he’s such an extraordinary actor.’ After school, and that key turn as Viola, the roles and praise kept on coming. Michael Grandage, former artistic director of the Donmar Warehouse, London, says: ‘Eddie finds an honesty and purity in the moment.’ Redmayne played a psychotic schoolboy in the thriller film Like Minds, then Angelina Jolie’s son in The Good Shepherd, followed by a role as Julianne Moore’s incestuous son in Savage Grace. The actor's latest film The Theory of Everything is due for release on New Year's Day and sees him taking on the role of a young Stephen Hawking . As for his personal life, in 2011 he was linked to actress Carey Mulligan (now married to Marcus Mumford of folk-rock band Mumford & Sons). But romance soon faded. The following year, he was spotted cosying up to pop star Taylor Swift, after she went backstage having watched him perform. But he denied any relationship, saying: ‘I spoke to her for seven-and-a-half minutes.’ In truth, he was dating Hannah Bagshawe, a brunette with a taste for Gucci frocks, who is believed to have been introduced to Eddie by one of his siblings. The couple announced their engagement in June, with Redmayne telling Vogue how he had very romantically attempted to measure Hannah’s finger for a ring by waiting until she was asleep. The marriage plans were kept very quiet, but according to sources, the couple became man and wife in a candlelit ceremony at 5.30pm on Monday. But his female fans can comfort themselves that, though he’s now married, they will be seeing an awful lot more of him on the big screen in years to come.","The actor is strongly tipped for an Oscar for his performance as Hawking .

"Kelly Brook’s muscular on-off boyfriend crashed his van carrying a load of dead badgers after falling asleep at the wheel while on a controversial animal cull, it has been revealed. David McIntosh, who is known for appearing in TV series Gladiator as ‘Tornado’, had been employed to take the dead creatures for disposal as part of the badger cull in Gloucestershire. But as the 28-year-old former Royal Marine drove his VW Transporter van to a furnace in the middle of the night, he swerved and smashed into a bus stop, the court was told. Former couple: Kelly Brook's on-off boyfriend David McIntosh (pictured together on Monday) had been employed to take the dead creatures for disposal as part of the badger cull in Gloucestershire . He claims to have lost control when a radio - which police used to pass on intelligence about the location of anti-cull protesters - fell under the brakes, Stroud Magistrates’ Court heard. McIntosh crashed after falling asleep during the night shift in Gloucester city centre just before 1am on September 29. He admitted driving without due care and attention and not having a valid licence. Passenger John Parker - who suffered bruised ribs, thigh, face and wrist in the crash - told the court he was checking Facebook on his phone when he felt the van change direction. Reading Mr Parker's statement, prosecutor Graham Dono said: ‘I looked up after feeling the vehicle change direction to see a bus stop. ‘I can't say if he was asleep on not, but when I looked at David both of his hands were on the wheel, but his head was on his chest. I believe his eyes were shut.’ The court heard McIntosh, of Altrincham, Cheshire, had managed to get the job as a driver despite having his licence for that class of vehicle suspended for running a red light in 2005. Making their point: Anti badger-cull protestors outside Stroud Magistrates' Court where McIntosh was fined . Mr Parker said during the incident he shouted and grabbed the wheel, shocking McIntosh into action, who hit the accelerator and smashed into the bus shelter. In a statement read out in court, . McIntosh, a former Royal Marine driver said: ‘I was carrying badger . carcasses to the furnace as I was involved in the cull. 'I was carrying badger carcasses to the furnace as I was involved in the cull' David McIntosh . ‘The radio was always kept in the vehicle on the dashboard so we could easily hear and keep up with police as to where the protesters were. It was blocking the clutch and the brake. 'Before I retrieved it I was heading off the road. I started to brake but it was too late.’ District Judge Joti Bopa-Rai said: ‘It is either that he has fallen asleep or been distracted.’ Unemployed McIntosh was fined £91, plus a £20 victim surcharge and £30 prosecution costs. He was given six penalty points. Scene: The bus shelter in Gloucester which was damaged when a van load of culled badgers crashed into it . He claims to have lost control when a radio - which police used to pass on intelligence about the location of anti-cull protesters - fell under the breaks . McIntosh crashed after falling asleep during the night shift in Gloucester city centre just before 1am on September 29 . McIntosh is a British TV personality, model, bodybuilder and former ‘security operative’. He . has served in Afghanistan, Northern Ireland, Somalia, and the Persian . Gulf. He was deployed to Afghanistan in October 2008 for six months. McIntosh, who was allegedly dumped by . Brook for being too fame-hungry - something he denies, was pictured . together with her heading to her London bar Steam & Rye on Monday . night. Around a dozen anti-cull protestors attended the hearing and waved placards outside court. They . were angered an alleged ‘collusion’ between the police and cull workers . via radio, and also that McIntosh was able to get a job without a valid . licence. 'It is either that he has fallen asleep or been distracted' District Judge Joti Bopa-Rai . Steve Tomlin, 64, . who spent 100 nights out in Somerset and Gloucestershire during the . cull, said: ‘Why wasn't he breathalysed? This is a case of a politically . motivated blind spot.’ Jude . Walker, 58, of Gloucestershire Against Badger Shooting, added: ‘It . certainly goes against what we have always been told about the police . being even handed. And what happened to the badgers?’ The address given in court for McIntosh in Greater Manchester matches the business of his company, Next Generation Fitness Ltd. Kelly . has previously posed for campaigns for People for the Ethical Treatment . of Animals (Peta) - who opposed the cull. Spokesmen for McIntosh and . Brook both refused to comment. Natural England authorised two pilot culls of badgers, which was paid for by the farming industry. A . spokesman for the public body said that it issued licenses to culling . companies which in turn employed their own marksmen. He added: ‘Daniel . McIntosh is not a Natural England employee.' The court heard the van was travelling from Tewkesbury to Maisemore in Gloucestershire. McIntosh . contacted the DVLA after the incident and was told his licence was . revoked in 2005 for going through a red light, it was said. Relationship: McIntosh, 28, is known for appearing in TV series Gladiator as 'Tornado' (left). Brook, his on-off girlfriend, is pictured (right) modelling Ultimo underwear . His letter to the court said: 'I have had numerous hire cars and have been stopped by police for random checks and not once was it flagged up.' District Judge Rai said: 'I have heard that this was part of the badger cull operation. I have to exclude anything to do with the badger cull. I am looking at the driving of an individual.' Neither Mr Parker nor McIntosh were in court. A spokesman for McIntosh said last night: 'David McIntosh was in a minor car accident last year that did not involve any other vehicles.  At the time David worked as hired security for various companies and assignments. ‘Specifically in this case, he was hired to provide secure transportation in the operation of badger culling where firearms were being used. ‘He was there to prevent any intervention as to insure the safety of staff as well as the safety of protesters by preventing any altercations. ‘David was not involved in the culling operation or process he was merely doing the job assigned to him of security and transportation. ‘David loves animals and his personal views are against the practice of culling badgers - but as an ex-military, David knows to separate between his personal beliefs and feelings to the legal task or job at hand he was hired to do. ‘The matter of the accident was resolved in court where David had to pay a fine for the traffic violation.'","David McIntosh, 28, is known for appearing in Gladiator as 'Tornado'

"Argentina and World Cup hero Diego Maradona thinks Germany's Thomas Muller 'has no muscles' but did well to rip Portugal apart as a 'ridiculous' and 'unprofessional' Pepe was sent off. Pepe's red card, after the Real Madrid defender's flailing arm caught Muller in the face before the thuggish nudge of his head made referee Milorad Mazic's mind up for him, helped the Germany striker become the World Cup's leading top goalscorer. It got Germany off to a perfect start, and Portugal off to a worst, leading Maradona to lend his two cents' worth to the game's issues. VIDEO Scroll down to find out who jumps higher between Cristiano Ronaldo and Pepe . World Cup winner: Diego Maradona led Argentina to victory in 1986 and had his say on the 2014 tournament .

VIDEO Muller does demolition job on Portugal . Diego Maradona feels Cristiano Ronaldo was restricted from being his usual self, courtesy of Germany's zonal marking. 'Cristiano Ronaldo was not allowed to be . the player he is for Real Madrid,' said Maradona. 'There was tight zonal marking on him . and he had to try shots from a distance. 'The . last time he had scored in the World Cup was against North Korea in . 2010. 'He will have to inspire his team in the two remaining matches . against the USA and Ghana to earn a spot in the round of 16.' When asked about Muller's performance against Portugal, Maradona told Times of India: 'He has no muscles, but he tore them apart.' The 1986 World Cup winner, then, went on to ridicule Pepe's behaviour at the expense of his team's tournament chances. 'It was just ridiculous to see him act so foolishly,' said Maradona. 'It's true Muller played his role to perfection in the act but there was absolutely no need for Pepe to do what he did. 'His unprofessionalism snuffed out any hopes his team may have had of coming back in the game.' Germany were already 2-0 up when Pepe was sent for an early shower, after Muller gave Joachim Low's side the lead with a penalty in the 12th minute. But Maradona had an opinion on that decision, too, adding: 'The penalty through which Germany broke the deadlock was really soft.

"Not so long ago panettones were expensive and exotic. But in recent years supermarket aisles have become awash with these Italian Christmas cakes. However, how do you pick the best? Italian chef Aldo Zilli put a selection of supermarket panettones to the test. Would any match up to his mamma's recipe? Scroll down for video . Italian chef Aldo Zilli put a selection of supermarket panettones to the test . Top marks: Asda's Gran Ducale Panettone Classico . Gran Ducale Panettone Classico . 500g, £3 (currently £2), Asda . Bellissimo! This looks truly authentic. No wonder — it's made just outside Venice. And it tastes as good as it looks. It's been filled properly, with a good proportion of fruit and peel (14 per cent sultanas and 7 per cent orange peel). The peel is deliciously chunky — as it should be. And the dough is sweet and buttery. With panettone this cheap and delicious, even I'd be mad to make my own. 5/5 . Expensive: Sainsbury's Classic Taste The Difference Panettone, £10 . Classic Taste The Difference Panettone . 750g, £10, Sainsbury's . As I unwrap it, I'm enveloped in the smell of an Italian Christmas: buttery dough and juicy sultanas. Growing up in Italy, my breakfast treat on Christmas day was home-made panettone and a huge latte. The crown is bouncy to the touch — so freshly baked — but the taste is disappointing. The peel content is just 3 per cent. For £10, I expect something more luxurious. 3/5 . Yuck! Tesco Maina Classic Panettone . Maina Classic Panettone . 500g, £4, Tesco . Though there's a reasonable amount of fruit (16.5 per cent sultanas and 4 per cent peel) it's shrivelled, not juicy. Its dough should be extremely soft, sweet and buttery; this is as dry and crumbly as the bedding in my kids' hamster cage, with a synthetic aftertaste. Yuck! 1/5 . Another winner: Waitrose Christmas Classic Panettone . Christmas Classic Panettone . 750g, £9(£7 while stocks last), Waitrose . The label says it's rich in butter and flecked with raisins and candied orange peel. With a whopping 24 per cent raisins, I agree (I normally use 20 per cent). This would be good enough as the centrepiece of my Christmas Eve feast. 5/5 . Taste the Difference Orange and Cranberry Panettone . 750g, £10, Sainsbury's . Oh dear — this is horrid. When baked properly, a panettone is golden-brown on top and buttercup yellow inside. This is pale and insipid-looking and it sticks to the paper, so I suspect it hasn't been baked properly. The orange is overpowering. No wonder — it's packed with 12 per cent orange peel. 2/5 . Not traditional enough: Lidl Favorina Panettone Cioccolato . Favorina Panettone Cioccolato . 800g, £3.99, Lidl . Rather than sultanas and orange peel this has chocolate instead. The chocolate is surprisingly good quality for the price — not too sweet. But the dough is crumbly and dry. My kids would love it. But I'd rather they had a proper panettone with my own chocolate sauce than this. 3/5 . Specially Selected Traditional Italian Panettone . 500g, £2.99, Aldi . There's not enough sugar and the fruit (14 per cent sultanas and 9 per cent orange and lemon peel) is on the dry side. The only way to save this is to butter a slice, sprinkle a little bit of sugar on top and then grill until lightly toasted. I'd rather pay a little extra for a truly delicious panettone. 1/5 . Italian Panettone Classico . 1kg, £15, Marks & Spencer . Wow! I love the white sugar sprinkles over the top. It looks like a giant Amaretti biscuit. As soon as I cut into this, I'm engulfed by Christmassy smells. My treat every November was to help my mum make panettones — six at a time. I'd mix the dough while Mum soaked the fruit in dessert wine. Once baked, she would wrap them in tea towels and hang them upside down on her washing line for four hours. That's the secret to keeping the dough airy. M&S's is a little light on fruit (12 per cent sultanas) but the dough is as moist as Mum's. Magnificent! 4/5 . Interview: Tessa Cunningham .

"Just two months after the launch of its new £1 make-up range, Poundland has had to fly in extra stock to keep up with the phenomenal demand. It’s had great reviews from shoppers, but I find budget ranges sometimes don’t work well for mature skins, failing to cover up signs of ageing. So identical twins Linda Hall and Pauline Day, 64, volunteered to try the Poundland products to see if they could tackle baggy eyes, thin eyebrows and freckles. Scroll down for video . Spot the difference: 64-year-old twins Pauline (left) and Linda (right) after their makeovers . Celebrity make-up artist Lina Cameron applied the same look to both women. She used Poundland make-up worth £10 on Pauline, and designer brands worth a staggering £400.50 on Linda. Can you tell the difference? FOUNDATION . Both sisters were concerned that their skin had pigmentation patches, as well as freckles, so a good base was essential. Both sisters were concerned that their skin had pigmentation patches, as well as freckles, so a good base was essential . Lina first used a premium primer, Bobbi Brown Tinted Moisturising Balm, £36, (bobbibrown.co.uk) on Linda before using a foundation, Elizabeth Arden Flawless Finish Perfectly Nude Make-Up, (£28, Boots), which went on easily, giving Linda’s skin an even tone. She also used three types of illuminating and highlighting powder: to reflect light, give staying power and make the skin matte. These were Burberry Gold Glow Fragranced Luminising Powder, £45 johnlewis.com), By Terry Touche Veloutee Highlighter, £35, and Hourglass Ambient Lighting Palette, £56 (both Space NK) Lina first used a premium primer, Bobbi Brown Tinted Moisturising Balm, £36, (bobbibrown.co.uk) Could the Poundland’s Gorgeously Flawless Foundation with vitamin E, UVA and UVB filters in Beige 4 compete? Lina said: ‘This is a brilliant foundation. The colour is very natural and texture not too greasy or dry. ‘Once the Poundland product was well blended, you couldn’t tell the difference between the two foundations.’ DOES POUNDLAND MATCH UP? Natural and effective.9/10 . BRONZER . Vital for older women, bronzer gives a touch of colour to the skin, which can get paler as we age. Brush lightly in the hollow under cheeks to give definition. Lina used NARS Bronzing Powder in Laguna, £27 (narscosmetics.co.uk) for the premium brand. She also used a small eye-shadow brush to trace a soft line of bronzer under the lower lashes to give the eyes definition) and swept a little on the jawline with a bigger brush to reduce the look of a double chin. Lina says: ‘The Good To Glow Poundland Bronzer was so good I would be happy to have it in my own make-up bag.’ DOES POUNDLAND MATCH UP? Sits well on skin. 10/10 . Lina used a slick of Poundland’s All About The Pout Lipstick in Purple Pop on Pauline’s face . BLUSHER . A hint of blusher on cheeks gives a rosy glow to older complexions. ‘Poundland’s Feeling Blush blusher was dry, cakey and contained lumps of glitter so I knew it would be ageing,’ says Lina. ‘Instead, I used a slick of Poundland’s All About The Pout Lipstick in Purple Pop on Pauline’s face and blended well, then I dusted the blusher on top to make it stay and to give a matte finish.’ The premium make-up, Giorgio Armani Maestro Fusion Blush in 500, £35 (debenhams.com) went on like a dream: proof a pricier cream blusher is well worth it. DOES POUNDLAND MATCH UP? Ageing and cakey. 3/10 . Lina used identical bright pink lipsticks on the lips of both twins. First, she outlined their lips using a lip brush, then filled them in and added a touch of gloss . LIPSTICK AND GLOSS . Lina used identical bright pink lipsticks on the lips of both twins. First, she outlined their lips using a lip brush, then filled them in and added a touch of gloss. She says: ‘The colours of the premium brand, (Bobbi Brown High Shimmer Lip Glass in Bellini 14, £18.50, bobbibrown.co.uk) and the Poundland version (All About The Pout Lipstick in Purple Pop) were the same. But there was a real difference when it came to texture. Poundland’s was oily meaning it would come off the second you went near a glass of wine, and it sank into lip lines. ‘However the gloss (Dare To Bare Sheer Lip Gloss) was a winner: lovely packaging and good value for £1. Bobbi Brown High Shimmer Lip Glass in Bellini . ‘It gave the same effect as more expensive products (MAC Pro Longwear Lipglass in Full Speed Ahead, £17.50, maccosmetics.co.uk) There really is no point in paying more for a gloss.’ DOES POUNDLAND MATCH UP? Only the gloss shone. 8/10 & 2/10 . EYELINER . Both twins have prominent eyes, but eyeliner pencil dotted in between upper lashes makes them look fuller. ‘I didn’t love the Poundland Kohl Me Beautiful Pencil in Black,’ says Lina. ‘The colour was weak so it took me three times as long to get the same effect as with the premium brand.’ She then used liquid eyeliner, Poundland’s Chic Flick Intense Colour and Chantecaille 24 Hour Waterproof Eye Liner, £22 (Space NK) to draw a little flick at the side of each eye to give a lift. DOES POUNDLAND MATCH UP? Liquid eyeliner was better than kohl pencil. 5/10 & 2/10 . MASCARA . Lina curled the twins’ lashes first to give a lovely open-eyed look before applying mascara. Burberry Beauty Effortless Mascara in Midnight Black 01 . ‘Burberry Beauty Effortless Mascara in Midnight Black 01, £22, johnlewis.com) has an angled brush so you can get right to the roots of the lashes,’ she says. ‘This was easily replicated on the Poundland Never Ending Story Mascara, by bending the brush at right angles. But nothing could disguise that it just didn’t have the thickening, lengthening look the premium brand has.’ DOES POUNDLAND MATCH UP? No luscious lashes here. 4/10 . EYESHADOW . ‘Unfortunately, Poundland’s eyeshadow (Colour Story Eye Shadow in Dusky Rose 5), was underpowered; unlike the Givenchy Ombre Couture in 13 Noir Sequin, £18, (debenhams.com) it had no staying power so I popped a slick of the Poundland blusher over the top.’ DOES POUNDLAND MATCH UP? Not a great eyeshadow. 4/10 . EYEBROWS . The twins hate their barely-there eyebrows so Lina filled them in with eyebrow pencils. ‘The Poundland version (Take A Brow Eyebrow Pencil in Brown) was pretty impressive,’ she says. ‘It only fell down because the colour wasn’t quite as intense.’ Lina used Make Up HD Brows Illuminator, 001 Champagne, £23.50 (beautybay.com) on Linda. DOES POUNDLAND MATCH UP: Not enough pigment. 7/10 . THE TWINS’ VERDICT . LINDA: ‘After eating a meal I had to top up the lipstick. Apart from that, my make-up made my skin look younger and stayed that way until 10.30pm.’ PAULINE: ‘I’m really pleased with the Poundland make-up. I thought I looked great, and its staying power is also good.’ Lina Cameron (linacameron.com, 07778 473599).

That means Bureau 121 is back in the spotlight in a major way as the world awaits more details in the coming days about how the unprecedented studio take-down was orchestrated and what U.S. authorities plan to do in response. Powerful weapon: Jang Se-yul is a defector who trained as one of North Korea's 'cyber warriors' in the country's Bureau 121 hacker cell. He says the North Korea's hackers can launch powerful attacks on the country's enemies . Defectors from the North have said Bureau 121, staffed by . some of the most talented computer experts in the insular state, . is part of the General Bureau of Reconnaissance, an elite spy . agency run by the military. They have said it is involved in . state-sponsored hacking, used by the Pyongyang government to spy . on or sabotage its enemies. Pyongyang has active cyber-warfare capabilities, military . and software security experts have said. Much of it is targeted . at the South, technically still in a state of war with North . Korea. But Pyongyang has made no secret of its hatred of the . United States, which was on the South's side in the 1950-53 . Korean War. Military hackers are among the most talented, and rewarded, . people in North Korea, handpicked and trained from as young as . 17, said Jang Se-yul, who studied with them at North Korea's . military college for computer science, or the University of . Automation, before defecting to the South six years ago. Speaking to Reuters in Seoul, he said the Bureau 121 unit . comprises about 1,800 cyber-warriors, and is considered the . elite of the military. 'For them, the strongest weapon is cyber. In North Korea, . it's called the Secret War,' Jang said. One of his friends works in an overseas team of the unit, . and is ostensibly an employee of a North Korean trading firm, . Jang said. Back home, the friend and his family have been given . a large state-allocated apartment in an upscale part of . Pyongyang, Jang said. 'No one knows ... his company runs business as usual. That's . why what he does is scarier,' Jang said. 'My friend, who belongs . to a rural area, could bring all of his family to Pyongyang.

Despite its poverty and isolation,North Korea has poured resources into a sophisticatedcyber-warfare cell called Bureau 121, defectors from thesecretive state revealed as Pyongyang came under the microscope fora crippling hack into computers at Sony Pictures Entertainment . A U.S. government source said investigators had determined that North Korea was behind a cyberattack on Sony Pictures as the studio pulled all plans to release its comedy, The Interview, about an assassination attempt on the North Korean leader. Hackers who said they were incensed by the film attacked Sony Corp last month, leaking documents that drew global headlines, and now they have forced an apparently unprecedented change of plans for a major movie release. The United States may officially announce that the North Korean government was behind the attack in the near future, the U.S. government source said. 'The Interview' had been set to debut on December 25, Christmas Day, on thousands of screens. 'Sony has no further release plans for the film,' a Sony spokeswoman said when asked whether the movie would be released later in theaters or as video on demand. Earlier in the day Sony canceled next week's theatrical release, citing decisions by several theater chains to hold off showing the film. Sony came under immediate criticism for the decision. 'With the Sony collapse America has lost its first cyberwar. This is a very, very dangerous precedent,' Tweeted former Republican House of Representatives speaker Newt Gingrich. He said the hackers in Bureau 121 were among the 100 . students who graduate from the University of Automation each . year after five years of study.

'They are handpicked,' said Kim Heung-kwang, a former . computer science professor in North Korea who defected to the . South in 2004, referring to the state hackers. 'It is a great . honour for them. It is a white-collar job there and people have . fantasies about it.' The technology news site Re/code reported on earlier this month that . Sony intends to name North Korea as the source of the attack. But when asked about the Re/code report, a Sony spokeswoman said . no announcement from the studio was coming. The company declined . comment on Thursday. Sony Pictures, a unit of Japan's Sony Corp, is the . distributor of 'The Interview,'  a forthcoming comedy featuring . a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. North . Korea has described the film as an 'act of war'. Last year, more than 30,000 PCs at South Korean banks and . broadcasting companies were hit by a similar attack that . cybersecurity researchers widely believe was launched from North . Korea. Months later, the South Korean government's online presence . was targeted, with the president's website defaced with a banner . reading 'Long live General Kim Jong Un, president of . reunification!' Under the threat of terrorist attacks from hackers and with the nation's largest multiplex chains pulling the film from their screens, Sony Pictures Entertainment took the unprecedented step of canceling the Dec. 25 release of the Seth Rogen comedy 'The Interview.' The cancellation announced Wednesday was a startling blow to the Hollywood studio that has been shaken by hacker leaks and intimidations over the last several weeks by an anonymous group calling itself Guardians of Peace. A U.S. official said Wednesday that federal investigators have now connected the Sony hacking to North Korea and may make an announcement in the near future. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to openly discuss an ongoing criminal case. Taken down: A poster for the movie The Interview is carried away by a worker after being pulled from a display case at a Carmike Cinemas movie theater Wednesday in Atlanta . Sony said it was cancelling 'The Interview' release 'in light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film.' The studio said it respected and shared in the exhibitors' concerns. 'We are deeply saddened at this brazen effort to suppress the distribution of a movie, and in the process do damage to our company, our employees, and the American public,' read the statement. 'We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.' Seemingly putting to rest any hope of a delayed theatrical release or a video-on-demand release Sony Pictures spokeswoman Jean Guerin later added: 'Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film.' A movie theater worker sweeps rain water under a poster for the movie The Interview at the AMC Glendora 12 movie theater in Glendora, California The fallout from the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack that began four weeks ago exploded Tuesday after the shadowy group calling themselves Guardians of Peace escalated their attack beyond corporate espionage and threatened moviegoers with violence reminiscent of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 . Sony has said it stands by the makers of The Interview, a comedy about two journalists - James Franco and Seth Rogen - recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . Neither attack was particularly sophisticated, but South . Korean authorities said North Korea was to blame, even though . 'hacktivist' groups - online activists who hack high-profile . targets in order to spread political messages - first appeared . to claim responsibility. Those attacks used rudimentary but effective malware which . security researchers later dubbed DarkSeoul. Also known as the DarkSeoul Gang, the hackers have been . involved in a five-year spree against South Korean targets, . according to a report last year by computer security firm . Symantec, which estimated the group included 10 to 50 hackers . and described it as 'unique' in its ability to carry out . high-profile and damaging attacks over several years. Some security experts have cast doubt on North Korean . involvement in the attack on Sony, citing the publicity-seeking . hacktivist style of the attacks. However, the use of an unknown . name by the group behind the Sony attacks, 'Guardians of Peace', . is similar to previous attacks by the DarkSeoul gang. It remains unclear if the DarkSeoul gang are outsiders . working on behalf of North Korea, or some of Pyongyang's troops . in the isolated country's own 'cyber army'. Base of operations?

"A stunning last-gasp header by Portugal's Bruno Alves earned his side a fortunate 1-0 win over fellow World Cup qualifiers Mexico in a warmup match in Foxborough, Massachusetts on Friday. The game looked set for a goalless draw when Bruno Alves soared to send an unstoppable header past goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa in the 93rd minute from a cross by Joao Moutinho. But Portugal, missing captain Cristiano Ronaldo who is suffering from tendinosis and a thigh injury, also had to thank their stopper Eduardo who gave an inspired performance. Match-winner: Portugal's Bruno Alves celebrates with Joao Moutinho after scoring late on against Mexico . Sidelined: Captain Cristiano Ronaldo who is suffering from a thigh injury missed Portugal's match with Mexico . Mexico dominated the second half but Eduardo kept them out with fine saves from Hector Herrera, twice, and Alan Pulido leaving the door open for Bruno Alves to grab the late winner. Portugal looked dangerous in the first half and Mexico keeper Jose Corona, replaced by Ochoa at halftime, had to deny Vierinha and then Eder after Fabio Coentrao put him through. Mexico came close to scoring before halftime though with a long-range effort from Andres Guardado that flew just wide of the far post with Eduardo scrambling across his goal. Portugal almost broke the deadlock five minutes after the break through Contrao but his close-range strike was blocked by Ochoa, who is battling with Corona for the starting spot. All together: Mexico players jump in a bid to block Miguel Veloso's free-kick . Eduardo was then called on to make the first of three fantastic saves with a fine block just past the hour mark to deny Herrera, who was set up by substitute Javier Hernandez. The keeper was called on again seven minutes later to stop another Herrera strike and in the last minute of regular time he pulled off a fine save to turn away Pulido's left-foot shot. Portugal, who drew 0-0 with Greece in their previous friendly last Saturday, play a final warmup against Ireland on Tuesday ahead of their Group G opener with Germany on June 16 before Paulo Bento's side face the United States and Ghana. The result was a disappointment for Miguel Herrera, Mexico's fourth coach since September, as he suffered his second straight defeat in charge of 'El Tri' after an unbeaten eight-match run. The Portugal match was Mexico's final warm-up before their World Cup opener against Cameroon on June 13 in Natal. They also face hosts Brazil before a tricky clash with Croatia in Group A.

"It could be BlackBerry's last chance - and it has returned to its roots. The firm today launched the Blackberry Classic, and handset based on its hugely successful Bold phone. It hopes 'loyal customers' - who include Kim Kardashian and Barack Obama, will save the firm following disastrous sales of its touchscreen handsets. BlackBerry CEO John Chen introduces the company's new phone, the BlackBerry Classic, during a news conference in New York. Pioneered in 1999 with the launch of the RIM 950, BlackBerry changed the culture by allowing on-the-go business people to access email wirelessly. Then came a new generation of competing smartphones, and suddenly the BlackBerry looked ancient. Apple showed that phones can handle much more than email and phone calls. Blackberry was late in overhauling its operating system to compete. BlackBerry now holds a small fraction of the U.S. smartphone market after commanding a nearly 50 percent share as recently as 2009. Instead of apps, cameras and screens, the $450 Classic focuses on keyboard, security and battery life . With the Classic, BlackBerry is courting its core customer, the business user. The physical keyboard is something traditional BlackBerry users prefer because they find it easier than touch screens to type with. The company is also emphasizing battery life and security. 'A lot of people say the Classic is aiming for loyal customers. And that is true,' CEO John Chen said at the gadget's launch event, tellingly held in New York City's Financial District. But he also invited people who haven't used a BlackBerry 'especially people who are young,' to try the BlackBerry Classic. The handsets have a legion of loyal fans. 'I love a BlackBerry,' Kardashian West admitted to the Code Mobile conference earlier this year. 'Every time I say that, people are horrified that I have a BlackBerry, and I don't understand that reaction.' 'BlackBerry has my heart and soul, I'll never get rid of it,' she said. 'I do have an iPhone, and I use that for photos, but if you have an email and you need to type fast, you need to have that keyboard.' Despite the endorsement, speaking at the APEC CEO summit in Beijing, BlackBerry CEO John Chen said he was not interested in hiring the reality TV star. 'I'm not into bringing celebrities on board,' Chen said. 'It's not that it's a waste of money but a question of where you should spend the money today.' Pioneered in 1999 with the launch of the RIM 950, BlackBerry changed the culture by allowing on-the-go business people to access email wirelessly. The BlackBerry Classic is available for sale starting Wednesday for $449 in the U.S. and 499 Canadian dollars in Canada through Amazon.com and BlackBerry.com. It will come later to AT&T and Verizon. 3.5' Square touch display . 8MP Rear camera . 16GB Internal storage . 35key Backlit keyboard .

Blackberry was late in overhauling its operating system to compete. BlackBerry now holds a small fraction of the U.S. smartphone market after commanding a nearly 50 percent share as recently as 2009. The company is trying to stay relevant on making hardware even as it tries to transform into an enterprise security and consumer software company. Whether the Classic will sell enough to keep it in the hardware business is unclear. 'It's going to be a niche product based around enterprise, based around security and pockets of the world where there is still strengths. The future of this company is not the hardware,' BGC analyst Colin Gillis said. The BlackBerry Classic is available for sale starting Wednesday for $449 in the U.S. and 499 Canadian dollars in Canada through Amazon.com and BlackBerry.com. It will come later to AT&T and Verizon. BlackBerry's director of marketing and enterprise Jeff Gadway demonstrates the company's new phone the BlackBerry Classic . BlackBerry has been expanding its efforts to sell mobile-security software on its rivals' smartphones and tablets to help counter the waning popularity of its own devices. And on the hardware side, BlackBerry partnered with Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that assembles products in vast factories in China. Foxconn, known for its manufacturing contract work on Apple's iPhones and iPads, jointly designs and manufactures most BlackBerry devices and manages inventory of the devices in an agreement that offloads much of BlackBerry's manufacturing costs. Foxconn is making the Classic for BlackBerry. Chen, who took over as chief executive 13 months ago, has set a goal of selling 10 million phones a year. In comparison, Apple sold 39.3 million iPhones over three months in the third quarter.","Classic focuses on keyboard, security and battery life .

"The Sony hacking scandal continued reverberating throughout the Hollywood film industry on Wednesday as Steve Carell's slated new movie, Pyongyang was canceled. The announcement was made just hours before Sony scrapped the release of the controversial Seth Rogen comedy The Interview, which was scheduled to premiere Christmas Day. The studio's decision to cancel the release of the film about a CIA assassination plot targeting North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un was prompted by threatening messages alluding to 9/11-style terrorist attacks against cinemas. Scroll down for video . Scrapped: New Regency has canceled the production of a new film about North Korea with the working title Pyongyang based on an eponymous graphic novel by Guy Delisle . Talent: The thriller was supposed to be directed by Academy Award winner Gore Verbinski, with Steve Carell (right) in the leading role . Titled Pyongyang, New Regency’s now-defunct film has been described as a thriller based on Guy Delisle's eponymous graphic novel about his experiences living in the totalitarian state, reported The Wrap. Steve Conrad had penned the script for the film and it was supposed to be directed by Gore Verbinksi, who was also expected to co-produce the movie through his outfit Blind Wink. Following the news that Pyongyang has been scrapped, Steve Carell tweeted to his 3.64million followers: ‘Sad day for creative expression,' followed by the hashtag, 'feareatsthesoul.' A short time later, the former star of The Office tweeted a black-and-white photo of Charlie Chaplin as a fictionalized version of Adolf Hitler in his 1941 classic The Great Dictator. Deadline reported the movie was set to begin production in March. Carell, the star of the critically acclaimed thriller Foxcatcher, currently out in theaters, was slated to play an American who is accused of espionage while working in Pyongyang. Speaking out: Following the announcement, Carell took to Twitter writing that it was a 'sad day for creative expression' The star of Foxcatcher was slated to play an American working in the capital of the totalitarian state . While New Regency has not publicly commented on its decision to call off the production of Pyongyang, the timing of the move suggests the studio behind such hits as 12 Years A Slave and Gone Girl has decided not to take any chances in light of the Sony hack. Guy Delisle became one of the few Westerners to be allowed to enter the secretive community nation, where he stayed for two months while working for a French film animation company. Over the past two weeks, a shadowy group calling themselves the Guardians of Peace hacked Sony's computer systems releasing 10 years’ worth of emails along with employees' private information like salary figured and social security numbers. Among the leaked material were dozens of embarrassing exchanges between top executives discussing A-list stars like Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lawrence and Aaron Sorkin. On Wednesday, the US government confirmed that North Korea was indeed behind the massive hack. Kim Jon Un's regime has gone on record calling Sony's The Interview an 'undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war.' Shut down: The announcement was made just hours after Sony scrapped the release of the controversial Seth Rogen-James Franco comedy The Interview . The studio's decision to cancel the release of the film about a CIA assassination plot targeting North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un was prompted by threatening messages . Thousands of theaters Tuesday announced they won't be showing the comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco . On Tuesday, thousands of movie theaters across the country announced they will not be showing the film next week, setting the stage for Sony's decision to scrap altogether the release of the movie that cost $42million to make. ‘Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film,' said a spokesperson for the studio Wednesday evening. ‘'In light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film The Interview, we have decided not to move forward with the planned December 25 theatrical release.’ Almost immediately, many in Hollywood voiced their concern, with writer Aaron Sorkin saying how upset he was that 'the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists,' and director Judd Apatow explaining the many problems this means for films moving forward. CNN Justice Correspondent Evan Perez said earlier today that government investigators believe that there is no way this cyber-attack on Sony could have been carried out unless it came from the top. Authorities are also looking into whether or not someone inside Sony helped the hackers.","New Regency decided to cancel production of the thriller based on graphic novel by Guy Delisle .

"After scoffing a huge roast dinner, tucking into a box of chocolates and finishing off a bottle of festive tipple, many of us are prone to falling asleep in front of the TV. But that does mean we miss out on all the Christmas specials, films and end of the year quizzes. With this in mind, a pair of teenagers has created a wearable band that knows when its wearer has dozed off. It then pauses and records whatever was being watched so it can be viewed later on. Scroll down for video . The KipstR band uses a pulse oximeter to establish when the wearer has fallen asleep, or wakes up again. The band then mimics a TiVo remote by pausing, recording or resuming the show that is currently being watched. Other people in the family can then change the channel without interfering with the recording . Called KipstR, the 3D-printed band was created by Manchester students Ryan Oliver, 15, and Jonathan Kingsley, 14, in partnership with Virgin Media as part of its Switched on Futures initiative. The wearable tech features a pulse oximeter, and a wireless sensor which means it can ‘talk’ to a Virgin Media TiVo box. Pulse oximetry is used to measure oxygen levels, or saturation in the blood. It is a non-invasive way of determining how much oxygen is being delivered to the part of the body where the sensor is placed. When people fall asleep, this flow of blood changes and a pulse oximeter can use these changes to recognise when someone has dozed off - and equally, when they are awake again. The current KipstR prototype (pictured) features a spark core chip, pulse-oximeter, push button, sleep mode indicator and a small LiPo battery . KipstR measures a user’s heart rate to detect sleep. It then communicates with a Virgin Media TiVo box to pause and record the current programme being viewed. When the user’s heart rate rises to ‘awake’ levels it triggers Virgin Media’s TiVo boxes to resume the programme. The current KipstR prototype features a spark core chip, pulse-oximeter, push button, sleep mode indicator and a small LiPo battery. The spark core chip at the heart of KipstR processes all the data from the pulse-oximeter, dictating when the band triggers TiVo to record, pause or re-play. The outer casing of KipstR is 3D printed using an Objet Connex 3D Printer using a resin called Polyjet. This resin is more robust than the rigid plastics used by most 3D printers. Wearable technologies such as KipstR could also be used to monitor wearer’s emotional reactions to their TV viewing, helping TiVo learn and tag programmes that evoke the strongest responses from the wearer. Virgin Media will be trialling KipstR this Christmas with customers able to register interest in KipstR from this month. It is also exploring how KipstR could sleep-control other connected devices in the home including powering up and down devices and controlling customers central heating, helping save time and money. Once KipstR establishes the wearer has fallen asleep, the band mimics a TiVo remote to pause and record the show that is currently being watched. And if the person wakes up, the show will resume. Additionally, once a show is being recorded, other people in the family can change the channel without interfering with this recording. Mr Oliver, studying at Manchester Creative Studio said: ‘We jumped at the chance to work with the Virgin Media team on this project, it was a brilliant challenge for us but we’ve learnt so much and are really pleased with the end result.’ The band features a pulse oximeter, and a wireless sensor which means it can ‘talk’ to a Virgin Media TiVo box.

Pulse oximetry is used to measure oxygen levels, or saturation in the blood. It is a non-invasive way of determining how much oxygen is being delivered to the part of the body where the sensor is placed. Oxygen in the air is breathed into the lungs before passing into the blood, where it attaches to haemoglobin, and circulates to the tissues. When people fall asleep, this flow of blood changes and a pulse oximeter can use these changes to recognise when someone has dozed off. Mr Kingsley added: ‘It’s given us a taster for what we would like to do when we leave school. We’re excited to see what the next project will bring.’ Wearable technologies such as KipstR could also be used to monitor wearer’s emotional reactions to their TV viewing, helping TiVo learn and tag programmes that evoke the strongest responses from the wearer.

"It has been almost one year since Osama Bin Laden was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs, but his feuding wives are still at war with each other. The youngest of the late Al-Qaeda leader's five widows, Amal, 29, had to be pulled apart from his eldest bride Khairiah, 61, after the pair began brawling in a Pakistan prison. The fight was triggered by Amal's suspicions that Khairiah leaked details of Bin Laden's whereabouts to the U.S. authorities shortly before his death last May. Guards have now been ordered to make sure their paths never again cross. Ladies' man: Two of Osama Bin Laden's wives, including his youngest bride Amal (right), had to be pulled apart by Pakistani security personnel after becoming embroiled in a catfight . The pair have been in custody in . Islamabad since their shared husband's demise, along with a third wife . and eight of Bin Laden's 20 children. A source at the country's ISI intelligence service told the Sun: 'Amal described Khairiah as ""the real killer of Bin Laden"". 'Khairiah accused Amal of sticking to Osama like a prostitute who wanted sex 24 hours a day.' The two women did not get on when they lived together with Bin Laden, and a third wife, in his hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan. They also shared the compound with eight of his children and five grandchildren. As Bin Laden's youngest wife, Amal shared his bedroom, while his second bride was one floor down. Trouble arose when Saudi-born Khairiah showed up in early 2011 and moved into the bedroom on the floor below. She was upset by Bin Laden’s perceived favouritism of Amal. Others . in the family, crammed into the three-story villa where Bin Laden would . eventually be killed in a raid on May 2, were convinced that the eldest . wife intended to betray the Al-Qaeda leader. In transcripts of ISI interviews . released yesterday, Amal said: 'Osama loved me the most. We used to talk . about romance - other things apart from Al Qaeda things. 'In the last days, he felt he was . being tracked down by the U.S. forces and their allies. He said his . death was to be orchestrated by Khairiah or family. He was ready to face it.' Home: Bin Laden's three wives and two daughters lived with him in the Abbottabad hideout just 200 yards from a military base which was raided last year . Going, going, gone: The compound was destroyed last year to prevent it from becoming a pilgrimage . Shaukat Qadir, a retired . Pakistani army officer, spent months researching the circumstances . surrounding Bin Laden's stay in Abbottabad, where he had lived since . 2005. He was given rare access to transcripts of Pakistani intelligence's . interrogation of Amal. Bin Laden’s . home life was stirred up when Khairiah joined the fray. There was . already bad blood between Khairiah, who married bin Laden in the late . 1980s, and Amal because of Bin Laden's favouritism for the younger Yemeni . woman, Mr Qadir said he was told by tribal leaders who knew the family. Even ISI officials who questioned Khairiah after the raid were daunted by her. ‘She is so aggressive that she borders on being intimidating,’ Mr Qadir said he was told by an ISI interrogator. Amal . stayed close to Bin Laden as he fled Afghanistan into Pakistan . following the 2001 U.S. invasion. She took an active role in arranging . protection for him and Bin Laden wanted her by his side, the tribal . leaders told Qadir. Khairiah fled Afghanistan in 2001 into . Iran along with other bin Laden relatives and Al-Qaeda figures. She and . others were held under house arrest in Iran until 2010, when Tehran let . them leave in a swap for an Iranian diplomat kidnapped in Pakistan's . frontier city of Peshawar. Revenge motive: The ageing terrorist was bedding his youngest wife, while his eldest bride Khairiah had to sleep in a bedroom on the floor below . Khairiah showed up at Abbottabad in February or March 2011 and moved into the villa's second floor, Amal told her interrogators. Khalid, Bin Laden's son with Siham, was suspicious, according to Amal's . account. He repeatedly asked Khairiah why she had come. At one point, . she told him: ‘I have one final duty to perform for my husband.’ Khalid . immediately told his father what she had said and warned that she . intended to betray him. Amal, who shared Khalid's fears, said Bin Laden was also suspicious but was unconcerned, acting as if fate . would decide, according to Mr Qadir's recounting of the interrogation . transcript. There is no . evidence Khairiah had any role in bin Laden's end. Accounts by Pakistani . and U.S. intelligence officials have made no . mention of her. Instead, U.S. officials have said a courier . inadvertently led the CIA to the Abbottabad villa after they uncovered . him in a monitored phone call. Bin Laden had two marriages before Khairiah that ended in divorce and had more than 20 children with his various wives. In addition to three wives, the . commandos who raided the compound also found an 'extensive' collection . of modern pornographic films. The . pornography recovered consisted of modern, electronically recorded . video although it is unknown who at the home procured and or watched it.","Amal, 29, and Khairiah, 61, had to be separated by Pakistani security officials .

"If Yeovil Town took Wayne Rooney on loan for one month, they would have to sack their whole squad. The Manchester United captain’s £250,000-a-week wages equate to a quarter of Yeovil’s player wage budget for an entire year. That will be the gulf in resources when the Somerset club, in the third tier of English football, host Louis van Gaal’s side in the third round of the FA Cup.

"A New Hampshire man faces more than 200 counts charging him with snatching a 14-year-old girl as she walked home from high school last year, imprisoning her and sexually assaulting her over nine months, according to indictments released on Wednesday. Nathaniel Kibby was arrested in July and initially charged with kidnapping the girl on October 9, 2013, in the White Mountains town of Conway. Despite a massive search and widespread public outreach, there was no trace of her except for a letter she wrote to her mother in November of that year. Nathaniel Kibby (pictured in July) was indicted on charges including kidnapping, sexual assault, robbery, criminal threatening, illegal use of a gun and illegal use of an electronic restraint device, according to document released on Wednesday . Kibby has been indicted on charges he kidnapped a 14-year-old girl, imprisoned her, and sexually assaulted her over nine months at his New Hampshire home . The girl, who turned 15 a week after she disappeared, returned just as mysteriously in July, a week before Kibby was arrested. Media outlets repeatedly published the girl's name and picture after she disappeared and when she returned home. The girl's family and prosecutors have asked that her name and image no longer be published because they fear the publicity and association with sexual abuse will slow her recovery from what they call a horrific trauma. Kibby, 34, was indicted in Carroll and Coos counties on charges including kidnapping, sexual assault, robbery, criminal threatening, illegal use of a gun and illegal use of an electronic restraint device. In the records released Wednesday, more than 150 of the indictments were heavily blacked-out. Kibby has been held on $1 million bail since his arrest at his home in Gorham, about 30 miles from the girl's home. He has a criminal history dating to 1998, including convictions on simple assault, criminal trespass and breach of bail conditions, according to court records. Police said the girl, now 16, was last seen after leaving Kennett High School in Conway. She walked her normal route down a busy road toward home and sent several texts to a friend between 2.30pm and 3pm. But when her mother returned from work, the girl was not home. Prosecutors said she had no way to travel or get food, shelter or other necessities on her own. They said she 'went dark' and could not be traced through social media for the duration of her absence. Kibby has been held on $1 million bail since his arrest at his home in Gorham, about 30 miles from the girl's home . Police did reveal in December 2013 that she had written home to her mother. When the letter surfaced, FBI Special Agent In Charge Kieran Ramsey said there was the possibility the girl had run away, but someone could still be coercing her into staying away from home. The contents of the letter have never been released. A police officer who has known Kibby for two decades said he's very bright, opinionated and thrives on conflict. In an interview in July, former Conway Lt. Chris Perley said Kibby, 'was smart, but he was also brutally myopic in whatever view he had. You could not shake him or redirect him in the way he saw the world.' Kibby grew up and attended school in Conway, a tourist-dependent town of about 1,800 people in the southeast corner of the White Mountain National Forest.  He worked as a machinist at two gun makers — Green Mountain Rifle Barrel Co. and E.M.M. Precision.","Nathaniel Kibby was arrested in July and initially charged with kidnapping the girl on October 9, 2013, in Conway, New Hampshire .

"It was the sword of choice for the discerning Viking - superstrong, and almost unbeatable in battle. Yet mystery surrounds a small number of Viking swords researchers have uncovered. They are all inscribed with a single word - 'Ulfberht', which experts believe may reveal their maker. Scroll down for video . a single word - 'Ulfberht' - on the blade of a Viking sword. Experts believe a German monastry may have been responsible for the product of the superstrong weapons. About 170 Ulfberhts have been found, dating from 800 to 1,000 A.D. They are made of metal so pure it baffled archaeologists, who thought the technology to forge such metal was not invented for another 800 or more years, during the Industrial Revolution. In the process of forging iron, the ore must be heated to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit to liquify, allowing the blacksmith to remove the impurities, known as 'slag' Carbon is also mixed in to make the brittle iron stronger. Medieval technology did not allow iron to be heated to such a high temperature, so slag was removed by pounding it out, a far less effective method. The Ulfberht, however, has almost no slag, and it has a carbon content three times that of other metals from the time. It was made of a metal called 'crucible steel.' It was thought that the furnaces invented during the industrial revolution were the first tools for heating iron to this extent. According to Ancient Origins, researchers are now closing in on the mysterious maker. 'New research brings us closer to the source of the swords, to the kiln in which these legendary weapons were forged,' it claims. About 170 Ulfberhts have been found, dating from 800 to 1,000 A.D. They are made of metal so pure it baffled archaeologists, who thought the technology to forge such metal was not invented for another 800 or more years, during the Industrial Revolution. Alan Williams of the Wallace Collection in London has studied the blades, and believes the maker is unique. 'It's much like putting the 'Apple' name on a computer,' he said. They were extremely rare and valuable, and would have been prized possessions of the most elite Vikings. Robert Lehmann, a chemist at the Institute for Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Hannover, studied an Ulfberht sword found in 2012 on a pile of gravel excavated from the Weser River, which flows through Lower Saxony in northwestern Germany. This sword's blade has a high manganese content, which signalled to Lehmann that it did not come from the East. The guard was made of iron with a high arsenic content, which suggests a European deposit. He traced the lead to a site in the Taunus region, just north of Frankfurt, Germany - where he believes it may have been made. While some monasteries in the Taunus region are known to have produced weapons at that time, the name of Ulfberht has not been found in their records. Experts have even tried to recreate the construction methods of the swords to work out how they were made. The manufacturing process used has also baffled researchers.

"FIFA were in turmoil on Wednesday after their World Cup corruption investigator quit in protest at the systematic cover-up of his own report. Michael Garcia’s resignation statement could not have been more damning. The New York lawyer accused FIFA — and especially their ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert — of a wholesale whitewash of the murky Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 World Cup bid campaigns. Garcia’s bombshell plunged world football’s wholly discredited ruling body into yet another crisis. UEFA president Michel Platini was the first to react, calling the sorry saga a ‘new failure for FIFA’. Michael Garcia has resigned from FIFA's ethics committee and cited a 'lack of leadership' Garcia alleged that FIFA had not only swept his findings under the carpet but tried to silence him by reporting him to their own disciplinary committee for speaking out. He also accused Eckert of having no independence and claims FIFA’s ingrained culture of self-preservation under Sepp Blatter meant it was impossible to bring about change. Garcia said: ‘It is the lack of leadership on these issues within FIFA that leads me to conclude that my role in this process is at an end. No independent governance committee, investigator or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organisation.’ And Garcia, who was head of FIFA’s ethics investigatory arm, went as far as saying about his colleague Eckert’s conclusions: ‘When viewed in the context of the report it purported to summarise, no principled approach could justify the Eckert decision’s edits, omissions and additions.’ He added that he had ‘lost confidence in the independence of the adjudicatory chamber’. Garcia's report was only published as a summary by FIFA, something Garcia himself quickly denounced . Garcia believes there has been a massive cover-up which he also fears will be the last word on the 2018 and 2022 bids. He chose to resign on the eve of FIFA’s executive committee meeting in Marrakech, which is due to vote on making his full report public, albeit with redactions where there are issues of confidentiality. Clearly, he believes there is no chance of this happening, especially as the FIFA appeals committee earlier this week turned down his complaint about Eckert’s ‘numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of facts and conclusions’. His appeal was dismissed on the bizarre grounds that Eckert’s summary was not legally binding. The timing of his exit, along with his incendiary comments, now puts huge pressure on the 26-strong ExCo to vote for full publication. The move to publish was unlikely to have received the necessary majority before Garcia’s intervention but his views might have changed a few minds. Russia, Qatar and England were accused of breaking rules during the 2018 and 2022 bids in the report . JULY 2012 . FIFA appoint US lawyer Garcia and German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert to their Ethics Committee. Garcia is brought in to investigate bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. September 2014 . Garcia submits his 350-page report. Eckert says it will not be made public, with only his summary published. OCTOBER 2014 . Garcia, among others, calls for the report to be published in full and says of FIFA: ‘(The) investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard... (it) might be appropriate for an intelligence agency but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution.’ NOVEMBER 2014 . Eckert publishes his summary, which clears Russia and Qatar of corruption, but claims England had undermined the integrity of bidding during their 2018 bid campaign. Garcia says the findings contain ‘erroneous representations ’, and says he will appeal. DECEMBER 2014 . FIFA dismiss Garcia’s complaint to their Appeal Committee. Garcia resigns from the Ethics Committee. Garcia, who was appointed by FIFA to probe the two World Cup bid campaigns in July 2012, announced through his law firm Kirkland & Ellis: ‘For the first two years I felt that the ethics committee was making real progress. But in recent months that changed. ‘The report myself and deputy Cornel Borbely submitted identified serious and wide-ranging issues with the bidding and selection process. ‘Soon after, Hans-Joachim Eckert indicated only limited information would be made public. Concerned that insufficient transparency would not serve FIFA’s interests, I issued a public statement calling on the FIFA ExCo to authorise appropriate publication. ‘The ExCo took no action on this subject other than to refer me to the disciplinary committee for violating the ethics code through my public comments about publication and watches given to certain football officials.’ Garcia and Hans-Joachim Eckert pictured together earlier this year at FIFA headquarters in Switzerland . The disciplinary committee, not surprisingly, rejected FIFA’s complaint against their investigator. Garcia, who will not take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, had a final swipe at FIFA’s tarnished leadership. He said: ‘It now appears that at least for the foreseeable future, the Eckert decision will stand as the final word on the 2018/2022 World Cup bidding process. ‘And while the Eckert decision made me lose confidence in the independence of the adjudicatory chamber, it is the lack of leadership on these issues within FIFA that leads me to conclude my role in this process is at an end.’ However the prosecutions launched by Garcia against five senior football officials — including German great Franz Beckenbauer and FIFA ExCo members Angel Maria Villar of Spain, Thailand’s Worawi Makudi and Michel D’Hooghe of Belgium — can still be carried on by Garcia’s deputy Borbely. FIFA President Sepp Blatter (right) hands over the World Cup trophy to Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani . Meanwhile Domenico Scala, chairman of the compliance committee, has the role of deciding today what portions of Garcia’s work the ExCo should see. Prince Ali of Jordan, an advocate of reform who was the first inside the FIFA ExCo to call for the report to be published, said last night: ‘It’s a shame that we have lost Michael Garcia, for whom we had tremendous respect. It was a shock to hear and he must have done it for a reason. It is emblematic of some of the challenges FIFA have.’ FIFA’s British vice-president Jim Boyce said: ‘I am totally shocked. The ethics committee was our most important group.’ For the first two years after my July 2012 appointment as independent chairman of the FIFA Ethics Committee's Investigatory Chamber, I felt that the Ethics Committee was making real progress in advancing ethics enforcement at FIFA. In recent months, that changed. On September 5, 2014, I and Cornel Borbely, the deputy chair of the Investigatory Chamber, sent a 'Report on the Inquiry into the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup Bidding Process' (the 'Report') to the FIFA Ethics Committee's Adjudicatory Chamber. The Report identified serious and wide-ranging issues with the bidding and selection process. (Mr Borbely also filed separate reports from his inquiries into the activities of the bid teams from Russia and the United States.) Soon after, the chairman of the Adjudicatory Chamber, Hans-Joachim Eckert, indicated publicly that only limited information from the Report would be made public. Concerned that insufficient transparency would not serve FIFA's interests, I issued a public statement calling on the FIFA Executive Committee to authorise the appropriate publication of the Report. The Executive Committee took no action on this subject during its September 2014 meetings - other than to refer me to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee for allegedly violating the Code of Ethics through my public comments, namely, my public request that the Executive Committee authorise appropriate publication of the Report and the on-the-record statement Mr Borbely and I released concerning watches given to certain football officials. The chairman of the Disciplinary Committee, Claudio Sulser, ultimately rejected the Executive Committee's referral. On November 13, 2014, Mr Eckert issued a 42-page 'Statement of the Chairman of the Adjudicatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee on the Report on the Inquiry into the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup Bidding Process prepared by the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee' (the 'Eckert Decision'). In a cover letter, Mr Eckert described the statement as his 'findings, including certain descriptions of the contents of the Investigatory Chamber's report.' The issues raised by Mr Eckert's selection and omission of material from the Report, and his additional comments, went far beyond the initial transparency concerns. As my public statement at the time explained, the Eckert Decision contained 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of facts and conclusions.' Accordingly, I appealed. A brief I filed with the FIFA Appeal Committee on November 24, 2014, outlined the Eckert Decision's most serious failings. Among other points, the brief explained why, when viewed in the context of the Report it purported to summarize, no principled approach could justify the Eckert Decision's edits, omissions, and additions. Yesterday's decision by the Appeal Committee declined to address these points. Instead, the Appeal Committee rejected my appeal on procedural grounds, concluding that 'it is not necessary for the FIFA Appeals Committee to enter into considerations on the substance of the appeal.' The Appeal Committee found that the Eckert Decision was 'merely a personal opinion on the Report' and had 'no legally binding effect whatsoever.' It reached this conclusion even though, under Article 36 of the Code of Ethics, only 'final decisions' may be made public, as the Eckert Decision, which was published on FIFA's website, obviously was. The Appeal Committee also overlooked the Eckert Decision's self-described 'findings,' including one stating that 'the evaluation of the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cups bidding process is closed for the FIFA Ethics Committee.' FIFA President Blatter recently reaffirmed that 'finding' during an interview published by FIFA, stating: 'Furthermore, there is no change to Judge Eckert's statement that the investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups is concluded.' I disagree with the Appeal Committee's decision. It now appears that, at least for the foreseeable future, the Eckert Decision will stand as the final word on the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process. While the Appeal Committee's decision notes that further appeal may be taken to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, I have concluded that such a course of action would not be practicable in this case. No independent governance committee, investigator, or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organisation. And while the November 13, 2014, Eckert Decision made me lose confidence in the independence of the Adjudicatory Chamber, it is the lack of leadership on these issues within FIFA that leads me to conclude that my role in this process is at an end. Accordingly, effective today, December 17, 2014, I am resigning as independent chairman of the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee.","Michael Garcia has resigned from the FIFA ethics committee in protest .

"A former Michigan high school tutor convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old male student is expected to be sentenced to at least a decade in prison after refusing to accept a plea deal and insisting her case go to trial. Abigail Simon, 35, was last month found guilty on four of the five charges against her - three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and one count of accosting a minor for immoral purposes - and will be sentenced in January, with a maximum penalty of life in prison. However, according to MLive, Simon turned down numerous opportunities to receive a lighter sentence in order to try and fight to clear her name, and could have gotten off with a few months behind bars. Between April 2013 and the beginning of a probable cause hearing for Simon in Grand Rapids District Court in August, the Kent County Prosecutor’s Office gave Simon the chance to plead guilty to second-degree criminal sexual conduct, which would have ended her expensive, lengthy and at-times humiliating trial. Convicted: Former Catholic school tutor Abigail Simon was found guilty on November 26 of sexually assaulting a teenage student . Guilty: Simon, 35, was found guilty on four of the five charges against her, three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and one count of accosting a minor for immoral purposes . Denied: The tutor had maintained through the trial that she was the victim of the male student . The charge has a maximum sentence of 15 years but, in exchange for the plea, she would have been offered a one-year cap in Kent County Jail, which also offers time off for good behavior. Then, after the probable cause hearing, she received another offer to plead guilty to accosting a child for immoral purposes and assault with intent to commit sexual penetration. That plea had a minimum sentence of five months and a maximum of 23 months, but Simon again turned it down. What followed was a three-week trial that came to a dramatic conclusion when Simon's guilty verdict was handed down last month. A weeping Simon insisted she was the victim in her relationship with the 15-year-old boy and during one of her aggressive exchanges with Assistant Kent County Prosecutor Helen Brinkman even declared: 'I'll never forgive you!' It was a scene so unusually emotional that even Judge Paul Sullivan was having trouble dealing with it. 'This thing is totally out of control.' the judge told his courtroom. 'I've tried to be patient but I'm beginning to lose it.' Emotional: Accused sexual predator Abigail Simon strikes a pained pose in court last month as an emotional exchange erupted between her and prosecuting attorney Helen Brinkman . 'I'll never forgive you!': Simon accused Brinkman's client of lying. Her defense spins upon the argument that she is the victim and was manipulated by a 15-year-old student . Out of control: At one point Simon mouthed 'I want to go home' during questioning. Even the fed up judge declared to the courtroom 'this thing is totally out of control.' 'I want to go home,' Simon mouthed to her attorney at one point as she sat at the stand, the last witness in the two-week courtroom saga. 'Did you tell anybody he forced you or threatened you before you were caught?' Brinkman asked. 'No, I said that 1,000 times already,' Simon said. Arrested: Abigail Simon is seen here in a booking photo after being arrested for allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old boy last year . 'I'm not sitting up here lying like your client,' shouted at Brinkman at one point. According to MLive.com, Brinkman accused Simon of 'mirroring' the boy’s victimization as a means of defending herself. The dramatic interaction brought the trial to a memorable close on Monday, with the jury expect to begin deliberations sometime Tuesday. Throughout the proceedings, lawyers for the 35-year-old former tutor are tried to convince a jury the teenager 'stalked, coerced and brutalized' the woman into sleeping with him. The boy, who was 15 when he allegedly had a short but intense fling with Abigail Simon over spring in 2013, would undergo two days of cross-examination. In that time he was pressed on the more than 1,000 text messages exchanged between himself and Simon as the defense attempted to show he was no victim. However the prosecution used the same texts to depict Simon as a predator who went after an innocent virgin, according to M Live. Simon was fired from her position as a tutor and study hall supervisor at Catholic Central and West Catholic high schools after the boy's mother found pictures of Simon in a garter belt on her son's phone. Simon and the alleged victim referred to each other in pet names, the teen testified last week. He said Simon called him 'boo' and he called his former tutor 'baby girl', according to Wood TV. ASmiling days before: Simon is on trial for allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old male student. Here, she smiles in court days before her trial's dramatic conclusion . The teen - now 17 - said their relationship was consensual and that they both knew it was wrong. One of the texts from Simon to the boy read: 'I’m scared that you’re only 15.' The pair were allegedly together between February 1 and April 26 of last year. Almost all of their encounters allegedly took place at Simon's apartment in the 300 block of Bridge Street North West in Grand Rapids. Prosecutors read a text from Simon that she sent while on spring break in Florida, Wood TV reported. Simon told the teen he should be with girls his age, saying: 'I’m just too old, as much as that stinks.' However the victim refused, begging Simon in another text: 'Please give me one more chance.' The teen started undergoing questioning on Monday November 17. He denied that he slapped Simon before they started having sex with each other and laughed at suggestions he stalked Simon. Simon is charged with first-degree sexual assault and accosting a minor for immoral purposes. Inappropriate: Abigail Marie Simon was working at Catholic Central High School in Grand Rapids when she allegedly began a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old-student .

"The actor who played the righteous dad and pastor on long-running TV show 7th Heaven before confirming shocking reports of sexual misconduct with young girls now says he's a flawed man who's worked through his demons with the help of the church. Stephen Collins isn't exactly brimming with God's light in footage from an upcoming 20/20 interview. The 67-year-old's skin is flushed and his eyes red as he admits to Katie Couric, 'I had put that stuff behind me...I didn’t want to have to deal with these things publicly.' But public they've certainly become and Collins finally admitted to his sexual misdeeds in People magazine Wednesday before sitting down for the Couric interview. Confessional: Admitted pedophile Stephen Collins taped an interview for 20/20 after penning a lengthy confession to People about the girls he touched or exposed himself to up until 1994 . Interview: Collins of 7th Heaven fame will appear on 20/20 in an interview with Katie Couric in which he confesses to his sex crimes but says he's a changed man who hasn't touched an underage girl since 1994 . 'I had dealt with them very, very strongly, and committedly, in my private life, but I think, I’m a human being with flaws and I’ve done everything to address it,' he tells Couric in the interview to air Friday. One way he claims to have addressed his problem is through faith. 'One of the main things about the Christian faith, is you know, Christ said in so many ways, ""bring me that … which about you is broken, bring it,"" and most people are broken in some way,' he says. In Colins' lengthy confessional essay for People magazine, he admits he inappropriately touched one girl and exposed himself to two others between 1973 and 1994, and that his actions were 'inexcusable' and have 'haunted' him ever since. While none of his victims have ever publicly come forward, and the 67-year-old never charged, reports of his misbehavior surfaced in October when his soon-to-be ex-wife Faye Grant released a taped confession which was obtained by TMZ in the midst of their bitter divorce. In the public backlash to the TMZ tapes, Collins lost parts on TV show Scandal and in the sequel to the movie Ted, while re-runs of 7th Heaven were pulled from the air. 'Forty years ago, I did something terribly wrong that I deeply regret. I have been working to atone for it ever since,' Collins wrote in People. He says he's decided to speak publicly about the reports because he believes some of his actions have been elaborated. Scandal: Collins is best known for playing Reverend Eric Camden on long-running family drama 7th Heaven (left). Reports about his indiscretions first came to light in October when his estranged wife Faye Grant (pictured together on the right) released a taped confession which was obtained TMZ . 'On the recording, I described events that took place 20, 32, and 40 years ago,' Collins adds. 'The publication of the recording has resulted in assumptions and innuendos about what I did that go far beyond what actually occurred. As difficult as this is, I want people to know the truth.' He says the only time he touched a girl inappropriately was in 1973, when he was 25 and a pre-teen girl came to stay with him and his first wife. Collins says he exposed himself to the girl twice before, but took things to another level on the visit. 'When the girl and I were watching TV alone, I moved her hand in such a way that caused her to touch me inappropriately. It lasted less than a minute, during which there was no gratification,' Collins said. 'I then left the room. I had no further physical contact with her. It was a completely impulsive act and it's haunted me ever since to think of what I put her through.' Over the next two decades, Collins says he continued to expose himself to two more teenage girls, once in 1982 and again in 1994. 'The first instance lasted second and the second about a minute,' Collins says of the indecent exposure. 'I had no physical contact of any kind with either girl. I don't say this to excuse what I did - it was inexcusable - but to clarify what actually happened.' Collins says the exposure in 1994 was his 'rock bottom' and what caused him to finally seek help for his deviant behavior. For the past twenty years, Collins says he's undergoing therapy and religious counseling, while praying and meditating every day. Family values: 7th Heaven was a show about a pastor and his wife, raising their large brood of seven children. A young Jessica Biel (to Collins' right in a blue sweater) played the couple's oldest daughter. Collins says he never behaved inappropriately toward any of the young actresses on the show's set . These treatments, Collins claims, have worked and kept him from harming other young girls. 'Since that day in 1994, I have not had an impulse to act out in any such way.' Collins has only apologized directly to one of his victims, who he says was 'extraordinary gracious', but has not reached out to the others for fear that he will be 'opening old wounds'. The actor also describes how the recorded confession came to be. He says he and his wife Grant were undergoing marriage therapy sessions in hopes of healing their relationship. The second follow-up session is when Collins says he and the therapist were taped by his wife without either of their knowledge. The couple of nearly thirty years, filed for divorce in 2012 but have been engaged in a heated legal battle over how to split their assets. Grant, who is also an actress, is fighting for high spousal support payments of $13,000 a month, saying she is no longer able to make a living from her career when she took a break to raise their daughter. She also says she only released the taped confession to police, when Collins allegedly denied to seek treatment for his issues. She denies ever turning the audio over to TMZ. Collins says the release of the tapes in October led to confusion over when he exposed himself to the young girls, and if it was possible one of his young co-stars on 7th Heaven was a victim. 'I appeared for eleven seasons on a television series with a cast that included minor females in our TV family, and countless other young actresses throughout the show's eleven years. I never behaved inappropriately on or off that set - or on any set I've ever worked on.' When the tapes were first released, law enforcement in New York and Los Angeles said they were investigating the claims. But law enforcement sources who spoke with TMZ said that despite the taped confession, they felt Collins would not be charged and 'the cases will go nowhere'. The LAPD confirmed to MailOnline on Wednesday that they never reopened a case into Collins, and had simply been reviewing the recording in October. Calls and emails to the NYPD were not immediately returned Wednesday. Collins says he planned to release a statement after his divorce was finalized, but decided to come forward earlier when the trial was postponed. He says he owed family, friends and the public an explanation. 'I want to reassure them about who I am, and I want them to understand that I take these issues very seriously,' he said. Collins is due to speak about the essay with Katie Couric on Friday.","The actor was first accused of the abuse in October, when his ex-wife released a taped confession from a marriage therapy session .

Brendan Rodgers lavished praise on Raheem Sterling - and his new haircut - on Wednesday night as the forward fired Liverpool to within touching distance of Wembley. Sporting a shaven head, the England international - playing in an unfamiliar centre-forward role - scored twice as the Reds set up a mouthwatering Capital One Cup semi-final against Chelsea with victory over Bournemouth.

He looked about 12, he looks so young, he’s just turned 20,’ said Rodgers. ‘I thought he was outstanding. He’s a kid that, for some reason, seems to be getting a lot of stick. ‘His contract situation is nothing to do with him. His representatives are the ones working with the club. ‘You can see he’s happy and enjoying his football. He was unfortunate not to score at Old Trafford on Sunday but he was a real threat. ‘He plays like Alexis Sanchez’s role for Arsenal, not an out-and-out striker but his speed and movement causes problems. ‘His ability to turn and drop in, his threat on the counter attack.

However, the whistle came from a section of Bournemouth fans as Liverpool made Elphick pay for his presumption. ‘I’m aware Tommy stopped because he thought the referee had blown,’ said Howe. ‘I heard the whistle myself from the stand, our supporters. Tommy thought it was the referee. ‘There you go; I’m sure the person who’s done it wouldn’t have meant to have cost us a goal. ‘I’ve never seen anything like that before.

"Mauricio Pochettino hailed the connection between his players and the club's fans as Spurs cruised into the semi-final of the Capital One Cup. The north Londoners were convincing 4-0 winners over Newcastle and will now face League One club Sheffield United for a place at Wembley. Pochettino's side have struggled at White Hart Lane on occasions this season, but the Argentine believes Wednesday night finally represented the coming together of his team and supporters. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mauricio Pochettino happier than he looks after Tottenham win . Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino hailed the connect between his players and the club's fans . The north Londoners were convincing 4-0 winners over Newcastle United at White Hart Lane on Wednesday . 'It was a fantastic night. I'm very happy because that was first time the relationship between the team and the supporters was there at White Hart Lane,' he said. 'That was maybe our best performance under me. We know Tottenham have tradition in the cups and this victory was important for us. We needed this victory and performance for our supporters. Our players needed to feel that atmosphere.' Of the favourable draw, he added: 'We need to have full respect for Sheffield United. We watched their game (1-0 win over Southampton) and they deserve to be in the semi-final.' Spurs took a first-half lead when Nabil Bentaleb looped home after an error from rookie goalkeeper Jak Alnwick and Nacer Chadli doubled the advantage 35 seconds after half-time. Harry Kane then got his 13th of the season before Roberto Soldado capitalised on a spill from Alnwick to complete the rout. Tottenham took the lead when Nabil Bentaleb scored after an error from  goalkeeper Jak Alnwick (pictured) Harry Kane scored before Roberto Soldado capitalised on a spill from Alnwick (pictured) to complete the rout . And Pochettino praised the form of man-of-the-match Kane. 'He hasn't surprised me,' he said. 'We need to be careful with a young talent like Harry and build him step by step. But if deserves to play then we have no problems.' Spurs climbed to seventh in the Premier League following Sunday's 2-1 victory at Swansea and now have winnable games against Burnley and Leicester over the Christmas period. And Pochettino feels his influence is now evident on the pitch. 'You need to understand that the process needs time,' he said. 'The team is starting to show more character and looks more solid. We have shown we believe in our way.' Pochettino hailed Kane's contribution after the striker scored his 13th of the season during the 4-0 victory . Newcastle, meanwhile, will now go to the Premier League in a bid to bring in a goalkeeper on emergency loan after Alnwick injured his shoulder in the second half. He is currently deputising in the absence of the injured Tim Krul and Rob Elliot, and that pair are not expected to return until the middle of January at the earliest. Alnwick is now a major doubt for Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby at St James' Park and manager Alan Pardew does not want to start 17-year-old Freddie Woodman against Sunderland. 'The rules do allow you to have an emergency loan if you have only one fit professional (goalkeeper),' said Pardew. 'We'll have to see how Jak's shoulder is, there is not a lot of time for recovery with Sunday in mind and there is no way a 17-year-old can go in goal in the Premier League.' Pardew added: 'I feel for Jak. It's a cruel game and he's really in the firing line at the moment.'

"A new email exchange between Scott Rudin, Amy Pascal and Angelina Jolie reveals another example how the producer blasted the actress to the Sony studio head. In the latest leaked exchange, Rudin criticises Angelina Jolie's planned remake of the classic Elizabeth Taylor film Cleopatra. Rudin had earlier described Jolie as 'a minimally talented spoiled brat.' This time however, Jolie was involved in the  exchange, but was occasionally taken off the chain so Rudin could comment about her behind her back. The newest leak from Sony's hacked emails come after the film studio canceled its release of 'The Interview' - which depicts the assassination and violent of death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un - after hackers threatened a 9/11-style attack on theaters that showed the film. Scroll down for videos . A new email exchange that has been leaked shows Scott Rudin trashing Angelina Jolie (pictured) Not nice: producer Scott Rudin (left) calls Jolie 'seriously out of her mind' while writing to Sony studio head Amy Pascal (right) Hollywood stars reacted with shock and anger at Sony's announcement. Rob Lowe summed up the prevailing sentiment when he tweeted: 'The hackers won. wow.' American officials say they believe North Korea is behind the Sony hack attack. The hermit state called the end of the film 'an act of war.' On Wednesday, 'Interview' stars Seth Rogen and James Franco were both spotted with bodyguards - a clear indication that they were taking the threats about the movie seriously. The exchange about Jolie, which was obtained by Defamer, begins with Rudin and Pascal discussing the possibility of David Fincher directing the planned remake of Cleopatra. At one stage, it seemed that Sony had secured the services of Martin Scorsese for the project, which was later abandoned. Jolie appeared so desperate to work with him that she even said to Rudin: 'Let me know if there is anything I should be doing. Like getting on a plane and begging Marty.' However, the Oscar-winning director is fully booked until 2016 and could not take on the project. Later exchanges discuss what impact Angelina Jolie shaving her hair would have on the movie. Best of friends: Despite was has happened, insiders says Jolie has been one of Pascal's biggest supporters as hackers release her work emails . Cleopatra, like most wealthy Egyptians, shaved her head so as not to get lice and wore a wig. Rudin, Pascal and Jolie considered whether the actress should be bald for the film's big sex scenes. Jolie wrote: 'The one thought I would ask you both is about her ""bald"". I think that made sense in earlier drafts but if we are saying every time she's in bed she has no hair or a shaved head it changes the sensuality. 'I wonder if we should keep it out and discuss as an idea with the director. But I worry we could scare off a director.' Rudin replied: 'First I thought bald but then I was sitting at home during the night and I couldn't sleep because of it so now I think shaved; Or possibly a fade like Kid 'n Play. 'Maybe shaved for Alexandria, bald for Rome? And then curly tendrils for the asp? What do you think?' Pascal liked the perm idea, noting how good Angelina looked with one in The Mighty Heart, which she described as 'that Jewish movie about Daniel pearl.' All good: The two looked tense when photographed just days after the first email exchange between Pascal and Rudin leaked, in which he called her a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' Rudin then takes Jolie out of the email chain and tells Pascal: 'Kill me now. Immediately.' According to the leaked emails, when the remake plan is abandoned, the studio executives consider filming a Shakespeare version of the story based on Antony and Cleopatra, still with the Tomb Raider actress playing the leading role. Rudin said: 'We ought to make this with her and [Michael] Fassbender or [Tom] Hardy or [Benedict] Cumberbatch and go home.' Jolie however responds that she thinks the script, by Eric Roth, is almost where it needs to be, and she would like to stay the course. Rudin then removes Jolie from the email chain again, sending a message to Pascal: 'She's seriously out of her mind.' Pascal said she was willing to arrange a meeting between the three of them to sort out any potential problems. However, Rudin replied: 'Nooooooo noooooo noooooo please! Not a meeting!' Earlier, Rudin had described Jolie as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' in a previously leaked email. Rudin eventually apologized for the comments he made in that email, as well as an allegedly racist exchange he had with Pascal about President Obama. He said: 'Private emails between friends and colleagues written in haste and without much thought or sensitivity, even when the content of them is meant to be in jest, can result in offense where none was intended. 'I made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny, but in the cold light of day, they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive — and not funny at all. To anybody I’ve offended, I’m profoundly and deeply sorry, and I regret and apologize for any injury they might have caused.' Seth Rogen, spotted at LAX on Wednesday with a bodyguard after threats of a September 11-style attack on movie theaters that showed the 'The Interview' These latest leaks come as the group claiming responsibility for the hack, the Guardians of Peace, have successfully forced Sony to abandon plans to release their move 'The Interview', which featured the assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un. The emails also reveal and exchange between Sony execs in which a producer reportedly tells CEO Michael Lynton not to case Denzel Washington in major films because the star doesn't sell tickets well in overseas markets - because worldwide goers are racist. Sony Pictures Entertainment pulled the planned Christmas Day release of the 'The Interview' after the hackers threatened 9/11-like terror attacks on cinemas showing the comedy. A spokesman for the company admitted the $42 million movie is unlikely to be rescheduled: 'Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film.' Sony's decision caused some consternation in Hollywood over what has been viewed as an act of voluntary censorship. Weighing in: Writer Aaron Sorkin (above with Pascal) said in a statement, 'The U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech . Dark future: Director Judd Apatow (above) said in an interview the movie to not release the movie will have a horrible impact on the film industry . Writer Aaron Sorkin said: 'Today the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists who threatened to kill moviegoers in order to stop the release of a movie. 'The wishes of the terrorists were fulfilled in part by easily distracted members of the American press who chose gossip and schadenfreude-fueled reporting over a story with immeasurable consequences for the public–a story that was developing right in front of their eyes. My deepest sympathies go out to Sony Pictures, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and everyone who worked on The Interview.' Rob Lowe tweeted: 'Wow. Everyone caved. The hackers won. An utter and complete victory for them. Wow.' He later added; 'Saw @SethRogen at JFK. Both of us have never seen or heard of anything like this. Hollywood has done Neville Chamberlain proud today.' Zach Braff also weighed in, writing; 'Canceling ""The Interview"" seems like a pretty horrible precedent to set.' Steve Carrell kept it brief, saying on Twitter, 'Sad day for creative expression.' Carrell's planned movie on North Korea Pyongyang was also scrapped in response to the ongoing problems with the hermit state. Federal government officials have said that North Korea is behind the attack, as has been assumed for the past two weeks, though they are not expected to formally announce this until later this week. Authorities are also looking into whether or not someone inside Sony helped the hackers. Short and sweet: 'Sad day for creative expression,' said Steve Carrell (above) In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, director Judd Apatow voiced his concern over the situation: 'What do they do when someone says the same thing about the James Bond movie or Annie? 'There may be credible evidence of imminent violence that I don’t know about. But if they don’t really have that information, how many movies are they willing not to release? 'Our community is based on freedom of expression. Are we going to suppress ourselves every time someone posts something online? It’s a dark future.' Former Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich blasted Sony executives: 'No one should kid themselves. With the Sony collapse America has lost its first cyberwar. This is a very very dangerous precedent. 'Sony should release ""the Interview"" online for free so North Koreans can't censor American creativity--should have Korean language version.'","Angelina Jolie is described as 'out of her mind' by producer Scott Rudin .

"Somewhere in this performance was a message from Brendan Rodgers and this Liverpool team. It was defiant and even dizzying at times. In a week when just about every bad statistic going has been used to bash Rodgers around the head, Liverpool are Capital One Cup semi-finalists. This performance, played at breakneck speed and designed to blow Eddie Howe’s tactical strategy into the English channel, was a reminder that Liverpool can still put teams away.

The next test comes by so quickly, when Arsenal travel to Anfield on Sunday, but for once we have to give this team 24 hours to reflect on a place in the last four. It is the least they deserve. Soon enough they will be under the spotlight again, but this was a gutsy display and at least temporarily lifted the gloom that has enveloped this club. They were 3-0 up, thanks to the two goals dutifully put away by Raheem Sterling and the sweetest cushioned volley by Lazar Markovic, before Bournemouth really knew what had happened to them. They are Championship leaders for a reason, but Rodgers and his team had ripped them apart here before Dan Gosling got on the scoresheet with a fortunate goal. Brad Jones’ clumsy mistake provoked inevitable scrutiny over the decision to promote the Australian over Simon Mignolet, but that was not the story of Dean Court. Instead it is the powers of recovery of those in yellow, the ability to put the 3-0 savaging at Old Trafford behind them to run out convincing winners here. Take Steven Gerrard, for example. Here he had presence, was full of purpose in his running and looked something like his old self again alongside Lucas Leiva and Jordan Henderson. Long may it continue. Liverpool were superior in every department, working over this aspirational south-coast side with a ruthless blend of finishing and determination. There were a staggering 51 passes in the build up to Sterling’s opener, a head-turning move that left Bournemouth’s defence utterly bewildered. Such was the speed it was hard to keep up, but eventually Lazar Markovic swung a cross in from the left for Jordan Henderson to head back across Artur Boruc’s goal. This time Sterling, who was denied three times by Manchester United keeper David de Gea in Sunday’s defeat, applied the finishing touch with a deft header. That was a team move, the ethos that Rodgers has been trying to promote at Anfield during a wretched run that has already brought them seven league defeats. What a lesson for Howe, the young Bournemouth manager in charge of a team that put eight past Birmingham City at St Andrew’s earlier in the season and scored five in their victory over Cardiff last Saturday.

Callum Wilson knows he should have put Bournemouth ahead, tricking his way into the Liverpool area in the opening minutes before he rolled his effort well wide Jones’ post. After that, this Bournemouth team simply invited Liverpool to put pressure on them in every area of this rain-soaked playing surface. Adam Smith, Eunan O’Kane, Junior Stanislas and Matt Ritchie did some decent things in patches, but this game was played by Liverpool at full pelt. It seemed as though they had scores to settle. There was a whiff of controversy about the second because some dopey fool in the Bournemouth crowd who blew a whistle, causing captain Tommy Elphick to check his defensive run when Coutinho was about to shoot. From the rebound Markovic was perfectly placed just inside the penalty area to cushion a side volley into the net. Rodgers is persisting with this three-man defence. He is short of a controlling influence in there, but they have plenty of muscle with Kolo Toure, Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren protecting Jones. They eased off occasionally, allowing Yann Kermogrant the chance to pull a goal back for Bournemouth immediately after Markovic’s strike. He missed and you felt then that this would not be one of those famous midweek Cup nights.

They operated at a different level and whenever Bournemouth’s defence drifted off, Sterling was there to take advantage. He scored his second in the 51st minute, rinsing Elphick inside the penalty area before his cute touch lost Boruc at the far post. There was a brief moment when this raucous crowd could finally get on their feet, roaring their approval when Gosling, a former Everton midfielder, pulled a goal back for Bournemouth. It was an error of judgment by Jones, the man entrusted with the gloves after Rodgers revealed on Sunday that he would be first choice for the foreseeable future. Even after Gosling hit the post with another chance, there was the sense that not even Liverpool could throw this away.

"There is no doubting the significance of Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby now. Debate has raged in Newcastle as to which their fans would rather see - a place in the Capital One Cup semi-final or a first win over Sunderland in six attempts. The majority sided with the former and a shot at a first domestic trophy since 1955. That dream, however, is dead. Alan Pardew and his players had talked of a ‘massive’ week in their season. Well, it just got bigger. Massadio Haidara consoles keeper Jak Alnwick after a night to forget for Newcastle at Tottenham . Newcastle's defence reels as Spurs celebrate the final goal of their 4-0 defeat of the Toon on Wednesday . For Alan Pardew's side, Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby takes on a new dimension now they're out of the cup . The manager had, in fairness, named just about the strongest XI available to him but it looked awfully weak against a Spurs side who were superior in every department. The against-the-odds spirit that had inspired Newcastle’s 2-0 victory at Manchester City in the last round was missing. It was, in the end, a rather timid surrender. Apart from Moussa Sissoko, the French battering ram who tried his best to barge his team forward, the visitors offered little. Sissoko’s compatriots Yoan Gouffran, Remy Cabella and Emmanuel Riviere — a combined £20million worth of ‘talent’ — were passengers on a journey destined to end in defeat from the moment Jak Alnwick spilled Christian Eriksen’s corner and Nabil Bentaleb looped home the opening goal. A Newcastle fan, one of 4,200 supporters to travel down to London, gives his appraisal of the match . These shirtless lads do their best to lift their team having made the journey for the Capital One Cup loss . This has been a Newcastle team characterised by resistance and resilience, neither of which was in evidence. It was their second heavy loss in north London in five days and such drubbings will do little for the team’s confidence come Sunday. Pardew is the only manager in Newcastle’s history to lose three in a row against their North-East rivals and, with the mitigation of a cup run gone, he can ill afford another defeat this weekend. It was after Spurs’ fourth goal — Roberto Soldado capitalising on another Alnwick spill — that Pardew turned his attention to the derby.

The thought of going into that game without Sissoko is a frightening one and, when he took what proved to be an innocuous knock to the knee, Pardew withdrew his star man almost immediately. His effort was recognised by the 4,200 travelling fans and they sang until the last kick of an otherwise torrid evening. Pardew acknowledged their support but will be in doubt about how fast such goodwill would evaporate should they fail to show against Gus Poyet’s side. The debate on radio phone-ins and in the local newspaper had been ‘which of the two matches would you prefer to win?’ Losing both was never an option. Pardew, of course, has done tremendously well to transform his own and Newcastle’s fortunes, but the mood can change quickly on Tyneside. After this humiliation, Pardew will be only too aware of Sunday’s significance.","Newcastle were demolished 4-0 by Tottenham on Wednesday night .

"Harry Redknapp has made a secret dash to Malaysia as he plots Queens Park Rangers’ relegation escape. The Loftus Road manager cancelled a proposed TV appearance on Wednesday night to fly to Asia to hold talks with owners Tony Fernandes and Ruben Gnanalingam. It is understood the discussions centred around the club’s January transfer plans; with the issues of budget and potential targets central to the meeting.

Redknapp is due back in England on Thursday in time to head his side’s preparations for Saturday’s Barclays Premier League clash against West Bromwich Albion. And his Malaysian mission is viewed as a major indication that Redknapp remains central to the QPR hierarchy’s blueprint this season. Redknapp has been under heavy pressure at various junctures this season due to the club’s difficult return to the top-flight. Monday’s defeat at Everton kept them in the bottom three, but Rangers have shown real signs of improvement under Redknapp in recent weeks.

And Fernandes is said to be more certain than ever that the 67-year-old is the right man to lead QPR to Premier League survival. Furthermore, Redknapp’s trip to the Far East to discuss transfer issues is viewed as a strong statement of confidence from those within the corridors of power at Loftus Road. Redknapp has placed a new centre-forward at the top of his transfer hit list next month, with Stoke striker Peter Crouch among his targets.","QPR manager Harry Redknapp travelled to Asia this week .

"Daniel Sturridge will be treated by medical experts at the Boston Red Sox baseball team over Christmas in an attempt to solve the injury problems that have ruined his season. The England star has not played for Liverpool since August after suffering thigh and calf problems, depriving Brendan Rodgers of his first-choice striker after the departure of Luis Suarez. Sturridge has been training in Los Angeles because the club thought that he would benefit from a change of scenery. Daniel Sturridge has been out injured since the end of August and will spend Christmas in America . Sturridge gets down to work on the beach as he looks to build up his fitness - he will now move to Boston . Ankle ligaments - England v Republic of Ireland May 2013, returned for pre-season. Ankle ligaments - December 2013. Missed nine games. Thigh - during England training, September 2014. Missed six weeks. Calf - during Liverpool training, October 2014. Missed three weeks. Thigh - during Liverpool training, November 2014. Out for six weeks (min) He will now switch coasts to spend Christmas in Boston accompanied by Liverpool’s head of conditioning Glen Driscoll. It is unclear what specialised treatment Sturridge will receive at the Red Sox — who share the same owners, Fenway Sports Group, as Liverpool — that is not available on Merseyside. But the fact that the Anfield medical team are going to such lengths to get to the root of Sturridge’s persistent muscle injuries emphasises the growing concern over the problem. The 25-year-old was injured just three games into the new season when he suffered a thigh strain in September while training with England for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland. Sturridge's latest injury was not connected to the one he suffered while on England duty in September . Rap superstar Drake poses for a photo with Sturridge and his Liverpool shirt . Sturridge pulled a calf muscle in his first full training session back with Liverpool’s first-team in October and then picked up a fresh thigh injury in November that has ruled him out until the new year. Rodgers revealed last month that the former Chelsea striker has suffered nine separate injuries in his left thigh alone during the course of his career. Sturridge suspects the problems are hereditary because his father Michael, who was a trainee at Birmingham, and uncles Dean and Simon, both former professional footballers, struggled with similar issues during their careers. In his absence, Fabio Borini, Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert have brought just two league goals .","Daniel Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since August 31 .

"England manager Roy Hodgson is in an unprecedented position, with all those responsible for selecting him for the post having left or being set to leave the FA. Hodgson was chosen to replace Fabio Capello in April 2012, shortly before Euro 2012, by the Club England quartet of David Bernstein, Sir Trevor Brooking, Alex Horne and Adrian Bevington. Chairman Bernstein left in June 2013 having reached the age limit of 70, football director Brooking retired from the FA after the World Cup, general secretary Horne is departing at the end of January and Club England managing director Bevington goes after Christmas. England manager Roy Hodgson (right) speaks with FA chairman Greg Dyke, who replaced David Bernstein as FA chairman in 2013, at the dedication ceremony for the 1914 Christmas Truce Football Memorial . Hodgson's supporters are gone (as in the case of Bernstein, left) or going (in the case of Adrian Bevington) But with the dismantling of the Club England set-up responsible for picking the national team boss, after the previous marginalisation of the International Committee, Hodgson has no one to report to on a daily basis such is the vacuum at the top of the FA. Hodgson, having been fortunate to survive the World Cup debacle, has since guided England to the top of their Euro 2016 group with an 100 per cent record. So there is no immediate debate around his future. But with the 2018 World Cup qualifying draw taking place in St Petersburg next July, the FA will soon have to address whether Hodgson, whose contract runs until 2016, should be given a new deal before that or be judged purely on the Euro 2016 results. Hodgson has led England through Euro 2016 qualifying undefeated, so his position for now is safe . UEFA may leave it as late as their executive committee meeting on January 27 - two days before the deadline for candidates for the FIFA election - before deciding whether to distance themselves from a Sepp Blatter coronation or throw their weight behind a challenger. Prince Ali of Jordan remains the most likely opponent to Blatter  from outside Europe who UEFA would endorse. But Ali’s situation is complicated by the president of his Asian Football Confederation, Sheikh Salman Al Khalifa, having already publicly supported Blatter. Dutch overlord Michael van Praag might still be persuaded to stand, but he is worried about whether he will have the total backing of his own confederation. UEFA could leave it late to decide if they support a challenger to FIFA president Sepp Blatter's re-election . FIFA ethics chief Michael Garcia’s resignation will at least stop him harassing FA chairman Greg Dyke about his non-return of the £16,000 Parmigiani watch gifted to him at the FIFA Congress last June by the Brazil football federation. Garcia has written a number of letters to Dyke claiming he is now in breach of the ethics code despite the New York attorney failing to disclose how many of the 65 watches handed out have been given back. Dyke, who has paid import duty and intends to auction the watch for the FA breast-cancer charity, was planning to show his disdain for Zurich by handing out watches to all guests at the FA media Christmas drinks. FIFA ethics chief Michael Garcia's resignation will get him off Greg Dyke's back about that Parmigiani watch . The word inside the BBC is that the Corporation itself might have been behind the story about sharing Wimbledon coverage with subscription channel BT Sport to save money. It is the scenario that would have to happen if the licence fee is frozen or scrapped and the Beeb might have wanted the negative reaction to them losing Wimbledon, or part of it, out there as a message to Government. FIFA president Blatter is obviously staying in one of the best suites of Marrakech’s famous La Mamounia Hotel for the FIFA ExCo meeting there on Thursday and Friday. But it is reassuring at least, considering his anti-English stance, that Blatter is not booked into the Sir Winston Churchill suite named in honour of the former Prime Minister’s stays there and where one of his self-portraits still hangs. Blatter is in a fine suite at Marrakech's famous La Mamounia Hotel, but not the Sir Winston Churchill suite . LTA in Virgin rumpus . The Lawn Tennis Association are involved in yet another rumpus, with plans to close down non-achieving high-performance centres. The LTA gave notice that funding would stop next September. But Virgin Active, who don’t like the inconvenience to their members of the LTA centre at their posh Riverside club in Chiswick, are cutting links in January leaving 100 top young players between nine and 19 with nowhere to train at short notice and angry parents complaining to the LTA. An LTA spokeswoman said it was a Virgin Active matter.","Roy Hodgson replaced Fabio Capello in April 2012, before Euro 2012 .

"Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet has distanced himself from the club’s recruitment policy and denounced the lack of quality in his side. The Uruguayan’s latest dig at the club hierarchy — led by sporting director Lee Congerton — comes just days before the Tyne-Wear derby. After five draws from their last six matches, Poyet has confessed that he does not enjoy watching the team play. And he insists that the responsibility for bringing in players to lift the ‘boredom’ is not in his remit. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail Big Match Preview: Newcastle vs Sunderland . Gus Poyet was left frustrated with a meek Sunderland performance against West Ham United . Stewart Downing scored for the Hammers on his return to his old club in the Premier League on Saturday . Poyet has distanced himself from the club's recruitment policy insisting he is just the head coach . ‘You know what is missing (from the team) — it is clear what we need to do,’ he said. ‘That is down to recruitment. I am a head coach. I am not going to be a head coach when it suits people and a manager when it doesn’t. That side of it is down to recruitment. ‘So, if you ever get the chance to speak to anyone on the recruitment side and ask them about it (signing players), you are lucky. If you don’t, don’t ask me. ‘If we don’t get more quality there is going to be more games like that (Saturday’s 1-1 draw with West Ham). It will be 38 games and 38 points. If we lose two or three everyone will start panicking and having heart attacks.’ The Black Cats are 15th in the Premier League, two points above the relegation zone. They have won just twice all season and have 10 draws — including five 0-0s. Jordi Gomez netted a penalty for the hosts before Downing equalised but the Black Cats struggled . Jozy Altidore missed an easy chance on Saturday and hasn't scored a league goal for a year . ‘We are passing the ball as well as we can, given the quality of our players,’ Poyet added. ‘When we get into the last third the delivery needs to be better. That is quality. The finishing needs to be better. That is quality. Heading needs to be better. That is quality. ‘The shot needs to be in the right time. Maybe take a touch and make space before shooting. Hit the target, not a body in front of you. That is about quality. I want more quality. Do I think I’ll get it? I don’t know.’ Poyet wants to make a renewed approach for former loanee Fabio Borini. Liverpool accepted a £14million bid during the summer but the Italian forward chose to remain at Anfield. Sunderland’s transfer team, however, do not want to go back in for Borini and that could further upset the head coach. Poyet, when asked when he will replace his misfiring strikers, said: ‘When I have got another one. ‘I would love to play with wingers and two strikers. Our wingers have got some ability, they can do certain things, but they cannot defend or run the quantity they need to run.’ Poyet wants to make a renewed bid for Fabio Borini - the striker was on loan at Sunderland last season .

"Arsene Wenger believes Thierry Henry deserves to be honoured by Arsenal beyond the statute depicting him outside the Emirates. The Gunners boss enjoyed Henry in full flight and at his best after landing him from Juventus. The France striker is Arsenal's greatest ever goalscorer and announced his retirement from football earlier this week. Thierry Henry became such a legend in north London that he earned his own statue at the Emirates Stadium . Arsenal legend Henry has retired from football to become a pundit with Sky Sports . Henry moved from Juventus to Arsenal in August 1999 for a fee of about £11m under Arsene Wenger . And, given the impact Henry had in north London, Wenger is adamant the club will mark the end of his career fittingly. 'We will organise something in his honour and I hope the France team will also give him the recognition that he deserves,' Wenger told L'Equipe. 'We cannot just end it like this. He deserves a proper tribute. It is very important.' Wenger (celebrating with Henry in 2007) insists Arsenal must honour his retirement properly . Henry had his moments, sometimes difficult to manage, but Wenger only found kind words for the 37-year-old. 'Thierry is blessed with a strong personality and he could get angry. But once he had refound his calm, he was always very clear headed,' he added. 'As well as his extraordinary passion for football, he always showed an incredible insight in his judgement of players. He has a real ability to unearth talent.'","Thierry Henry retired from football earlier this week .

"Toulon's former Leicester prop Martin Castrogiovanni has received a suspended four-match ban after he admitted a misconduct complaint, European Professional Club Rugby has announced. Castrogiovanni has also been ordered to pay £7,926 (10,000 euros) to charity in Leicester following his post-match comments aimed at the Premiership club and their rugby director Richard Cockerill after Toulon's 25-21 European Champions Cup defeat against the Tigers earlier this month. The Italy international appeared before an independent disciplinary committee in London on Thursday. His suspension is suspended until April 30 2016, and will be activated 'in the event of any off-field misconduct complaint being successfully brought against him', EPCR said. Martin Castrogiovanni (right) launched a verbal tirade against his former boss Richard Cockerill . Cockerill was dismayed by the comments and claims they have sullied Castrogiovanni's standing . A misconduct complaint charge was lodged against 33-year-old Castrogiovanni, who has won 107 Test caps, following a bizarre post-match episode at Welford Road on December 7. He sought out English journalists in the Leicester press room and then launched an expletive-laden outburst at Cockerill and Tigers over his perception of the way he left the Aviva Premiership club in 2013. His six-minute tirade included nine mentions of the f-word and two of the c-word. In a statement, EPCR said: 'The misconduct complaint against Castrogiovanni was that after the match he made a number of comments to the media in which he attacked, disparaged, criticised, damaged and/or brought into disrepute Leicester Tigers, the club's director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, EPCR, the European Rugby Champions Cup and the sport of rugby union in contravention of the disciplinary rules of the European Rugby Champions Cup Participation Agreement 2014/15. Castrogiovanni has been handed a suspended four-match ban after admitting a misconduct complaint . Castrogiovanni's comments came after Leicester's 25-21 win against Toulon on December 7 . 'After considering evidence and hearing submissions on behalf of Castrogiovanni, who pleaded guilty, and on behalf of the EPCR disciplinary officer, the independent disciplinary committee found that Castrogiovanni was guilty of misconduct and that the comments made were utterly indefensible. 'The committee chairman, Antony Davies, accepted that Castrogiovanni's comments regarding Leicester Tigers being 'amateur' were made in an ironic and questioning manner, and therefore did not constitute criticism. 'He also acknowledged the player's genuine remorse. 'Castrogiovanni was ordered to pay E10,000 to a charity in the city of Leicester and was banned for four matches with the ban suspended until 30 April 2016. 'The ban will be activated in the event of any off-field misconduct complaint being successfully brought against him. He was also ordered to pay costs.' Castrogiovanni, who did not play in last weekend's return Champions Cup fixture between Toulon and Leicester, was accompanied at the hearing by his legal representative Julian Pike, Toulon team manager Tom Whitford and the player's agent Matthew Ginvert.","Martin Castrogiovanni has admitted a misconduct complaint .

"Former Tottenham and Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas has ruled out the possibility of replacing Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool. The Zenit St Petersburg manager has been linked with the Anfield hot-seat in some quarters but he insists that he has no intention of returning to the Premier League after two shorts spells in London. Rodgers is under pressure with the Reds sitting 11th in the table, having been eliminated from the Champions League at the group stage. Zenit St Petersburg boss Andre Villas-Boas has ruled out a return to the Premier League with Liverpool . Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard looks dejected during his side's 3-0 defeat by Manchester United on Sunday . But Villas-Boas is enjoying his role in Russia and has no plans to return to England anytime soon. In an interview with Portuguese TV channel TVI on Tuesday, the 37-year-old said: 'I'm not the least interested in this. Returning to England is definitely not in my plans. 'I liked coaching in England, it was a positive experience, but negative things also happened.' Villas-Boas left Spurs in December 2013 following a 5-0 home defeat by Liverpool but he insists he was not sacked by the north London club. Brendan Rodgers is under pressure with Liverpool sitting 11th in the table and out of the Champions League . Villas-Boas has led his Zenit players to a seven-point lead at the top of the Russian Premier League . 'Tottenham set a points and victories record in my first season, and missed out on the Champions League by one point and had a great run in the Europa League,' he said. 'In the second season, at the time I left we had more points than in the previous season. I ended up leaving by mutual agreement - it wasn't a sacking - because I gave full support to the football director Franco Baldini who meanwhile had other ambitions, meaning that I ended up with players that did not fit the profile I wanted. 'The chairman proposed a challenge to increase Tottenham's competitive level, but immediately [Luka] Modric left and we didn't get any of the targets I had identified, such as Joao Moutinho, Willian, Oscar or Leandro Damiao. These were promises that were not kept. I had a group of players I had not chosen.' Villas-Boas insists he was not sacked by Tottenham in December 2013 and agreed to leave the London club . The Portuguese was disappointed to miss out of Brazilian midfielder Willian during his time at White Hart Lane . The ex-Porto boss was given the boot by Chelsea after just seven-and-a-half months but he insists that a legal battle between owner Roman Abramovich and his former business partner Boris Berezovsky had a part to play in his sacking. Villas-Boas added: 'I arrived at a difficult time in the private life of the chairman, who was rarely present. This clearly had an effect. 'Then I was surprised and I am still surprised that the chairman's intentions changed. When I went there the idea was to rebuild the team.' Roman Abramovich was involved in a long legal battle with his former business partner Boris Berezovsky .","Liverpool have been linked with Andre Villas-Boas .

"Bournemouth's young players will need to ensure they don't get too carried away when the senior side take on Liverpool in their Capital One Cup quarter-final. The Championship club have enforced a set of strict rules for their stars of the future, one of which is a £20 fine for inappropriate posts on social media sites. The youth team will be in attendance at the Goldsands Stadium on Wednesday night but, with controversial refereeing decisions often the cause of angry tweets, they'd be wise to leave their mobile phones at home.

QPR defender Rio Ferdinand was banned for three matches and fined £25,000 by the FA earlier this season after replying to someone on Twitter using the word 'sket' - slang for a promiscuous female. And while the Cherries youth team can expect to get away with a lighter punishment, their fine will be doubled if they fail to pay up within seven days. Ahead of the Championship side's clash with Liverpool, Sportsmail's Neil Ashton snapped a laminated poster at the club's ground which details all of the reasons youth players can be fined. As well as stupidity on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, Bournemouth's youngsters are forced to pay £10 if they have their mobile phone switched on in a dressing room or classroom. Missing more than 10 minutes of a first-team match also carries a £10 fine, while any breach of curfew will cost them £20. Other offences include being sent off, booked for dissent and wearing inappropriate clothing. The methods of Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe have helped the Cherries to the top of the Championship . Arsenal's fine system was revealed by Sportsmail in January last year, with defender Per Mertesacker acting as Arsene Wenger's debt collector. Fines include £1,000 for unused players who do not turn up at home matches without permission, £500 for being more than 15 minutes late for training and £100 for taking newspapers into the dressing room. When asked why Mertesacker was in charge, Wenger said: 'The Germans do well economically and we respect that. They are the only ones that make money in Europe. That’s why we’ve chosen a German.'

"An Alfred Finnbogason double gave David Moyes's Real Sociedad a 2-0 victory over third tier Real Oviedo and earned them a place in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. Oviedo had held Sociedad to a 0-0 draw at home but Real, who fielded a number of reserve players, were on top in front of their own fans, except for a brief spell at the start of the second half. VIDEO Scroll down for David Moyes: We're saving some goals for match against Levante . Alfred Finnbogason scored twice for Real Sociedad to overcome third tier Real Oviedo . Sergio Canales and Pablo Hervias moved the ball around well for Sociedad on the wings and Finnbogason fluffed a couple of early chances, before the hosts took the lead. Ruben Pardo knocked the ball over the top and Hervias slid it across the penalty area for Finnbogason to score after 28 minutes. David Moyes claimed his second victory as Real Sociedad manager on Wednesday night . Confidence is fragile in San Sebastian at the moment and there was tension in the stands as Oviedo pressed forward after the break but Finnbogason fired in a volley from close range on the hour to seal the win for Moyes's side who are languishing in 14th in La Liga. Real Madrid and Barcelona are already in the last 16 and were joined by Villarreal who beat Cadiz 5-1 on aggregate and Granada, who knocked out Cordoba 2-1. Elsewhere on Wednesday, Espanyol beat Alaves 3-0 on aggregate, Getafe had a 5-1 aggregate win against Eibar and Levante went through on away goals against Albacete after drawing 1-1 over two legs.","Alfred Finnbogason scored twice in 2-0 victory over third tier Real Oviedo .

"Alastair Cook will be 30 on Christmas Day and should be able to celebrate his landmark birthday as England's World Cup captain. After a 'hell of a year', though, he will be taking nothing for granted as the selectors consider - as they have promised - all aspects of England's 5-2 defeat in Sri Lanka as part of their scheduled series review, before announcing a 16-man tri-series squad on Saturday. Cook conceded after the margin of his fifth successive one-day international series defeat was confirmed on Tuesday as 5-2, by an 87-run trouncing at Colombo's Premadasa Stadium, that he has no 'divine right' to be selected to lead the team to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand early next year. Alastair Cook has endured a horrible series as England captain this winter in Sri Lanka . He can be encouraged, however, by England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton's strong hint that - despite his 'miserable' run of form - he is highly likely to retain the gig. For Cook, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity - because however England fare down under, with or without him, it is hard to envisage him being back for much more with his sheet-anchor skills in a fast-developing format. Downton also described 2014 as a 'traumatic' 12 months as he reflected on his tenure - which began at the start of January, as England were completing their unexpected whitewash Ashes defeat. One crisis after another followed, the messy aftermath of the Ashes including the sacking of Kevin Pietersen and resignation of coach Andy Flower. As Cook and Flower's replacement, the returning Peter Moores, tried to forge a 'new era', the captain especially endured the most taxing of summers as calls for his resignation started to wane only once England turned round their Test fortunes en route to a 3-1 win over India. After Tillekaratne Dilshan's century had helped to inflict England's final defeat of 2014, Cook said: 'It's been a hell of a year. Cook has consistently failed with the bat at the top of the order in one-day internationals . 'We haven't won a lot of games, and there's been a big change in personnel. 'It's certainly been a year of transition - from 15 months ago, when we were winning the Ashes at home, to what's happened. 'It's been a year you wouldn't expect, but England have found some outstanding cricketers as well.' Among them, perhaps most prominent are Moeen Ali and Gary Ballance - the latter palpably unlucky to be omitted from England's ODI squad in Sri Lanka and, even now, a plausible outsider to make the final 15 for that World Cup. Others, such as pace-bowling pair Chris Woakes and Chris Jordan, have made late surges for central roles at the global tournament - while Joe Root alone excelled himself amid the inconsistency elsewhere from the tourists. Asked to identify where England struggled most, Cook said: 'One of the hardest things was taking wickets up front - so Sri Lanka, most of the time, had a good base to get going from. 'The one game we did take early wickets, we won. 'Also, batting at the right rate without losing wickets. 'We were scoring at a good rate, but we weren't good enough to do it and keep wickets in hand.' England are still searching for that successful ODI formula, with the bat especially, which others seem to have hit upon first. Suranga Lakmal celebrates as Sri Lanka enacted a humiliating series win against England . Many key figures within the game have called on England to call time on Cook's captaincy . Scoring at a winning tempo, without a damaging risk factor, is a balance they find difficult to strike. Cook, however, is not above learning from others and adapting to effect improvement. 'The way Sanga [Kumar Sangakkara] and Dilshan played in particular, they've obviously taken the right options - good enough to hit the boundaries, and stay in. 'We've been hitting the boundaries, and not staying in.' As for his own continued lack of productivity at the top of the order - 119 runs in six innings at an average of 19.83 and strike rate of 67.23 - he knows much, much better is required. He said: 'There's not many players who've been at the top of the game for long periods and haven't had tough moments. 'There's no one, I don't think... maybe Bradman is one. 'Everyone has really tough moments, as a batter particularly, because it's a hard game. 'You're playing against the best players in the world, week in week out, at the top of the order. 'It's very easy sitting watching... it's harder walking out and doing it.'","England lost against Sri Lanka in the ODI series this winter .

"England are heading to a World Cup in Australia and New Zealand with all the attention on their captain and his form — and that’s worrying. The issue with Alastair Cook I’m afraid is the same as it was last summer. I said then I was concerned that the captaincy came at the expense of his best form and it is particularly relevant in one-day cricket ahead of the World Cup. We are talking about a world-class batsman, a player whose stats stood comparison with Sachin Tendulkar’s at the same age, but one who has now failed to score a century in 59 innings in all cricket for England. England captain Alastair Cook (centre) watches the presentations after losing to Sri Lanka on Tuesday . Cook shows his frustrations as he walks back to the pavilion after his dismissal against Sri Lanka . Cook (right) walks past a lion mascot ahead of the final one-day international in Colombo on Tuesday . VIDEO Alastair Cook on England's loss to Sri Lanka . If Cook was a Mike Brearley-type figure as a leader you might understand England’s desire to keep him at the helm in Test and one-day cricket, but is it worth sacrificing his batting so that he can be an ‘OK’ captain? Cook is a fighter and wants to prove people wrong again and you have to admire that. The loyalty of the selectors is admirable in many ways, too, but it has led to issues, not least whether the captain is worth his place in the side. In the last one-day international in Sri Lanka, for instance, Cook would have had to go up to Ravi Bopara and tell him he was leaving him out. But Ravi could have been forgiven for thinking: ‘Hang on, why are you still in the side?’ If the World Cup were in the sub-continent there is no way Cook should be captain — it is all too obvious what would happen to him in Sri Lanka — but as it’s in Australia and New Zealand he might do reasonably well. It is whether it is enough in the modern world of one-day cricket for England to reach the latter stages and as it stands the selectors are simply left hoping that it will be ‘all right on the night’. It would not be too much of a gamble to replace him now. It should have happened months ago, of course, and more dynamic players should have been given time to bed into the side, but England do not have much to lose now. It is a question of whether they want to rock the boat and hurt the captain they have put such store in by admitting they were wrong and giving the captaincy to Eoin Morgan or, at a push, Joe Root. It’s understandable that the focus should be on Cook, but that does mask a lot of problems that are just as serious as his lack of runs. Morgan’s form is key among them. He is such an important player, England’s most important batsman in the one-day game, but his form has in many ways been worse than Cook’s and that’s a huge concern. If England are going to have any chance at this World Cup they simply have to have Morgan at his best because he is vital to them reaching the scores of 300-plus that are going to be required. The captaincy seems to have brought something like the best out of him in recent times so maybe that would galvanise him now, but if it is not to be that, then England have to sit Morgan down and work through what’s wrong. Eoin Morgan makes signs to his team-mates during the match against Sri Lanka in Colombo . Joe Root (right) bats as England took on Sri Lanka in the final match of the ODI series . Sri Lanka players embrace as they celebrate their victory over England on Tuesday . To me, though, the bowling is an even bigger worry than the batting because England are lacking wicket-takers in this form of the game. They are pointing to Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson coming back — but hang on a minute. Broad has traditionally taken time to work his way back to his best after injury, while if the white ball does not swing, Anderson may struggle for wickets. If England do not take wickets they will always be chasing more than 300 in this World Cup — or will have to try to set that, and then we come back to whether the batting is dynamic enough to reach those heights. These problems, of course, are nothing new. We put Test cricket first in this country and that means that predominantly Test batsmen in myself, Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss have been in charge for the last three World Cups. Perhaps the selectors wanted to stay loyal to their Test leaders on those occasions, too, and we were all grateful about it at the time —but it didn’t work for us all then and you have to say the odds are against it working for England now. When I helped compile the Schofield Report seven years ago, we were saying one-day cricket should be treated just as seriously as Test cricket and I see that Paul Downton was saying the same thing this week. Well, if England really mean it this time then they have to put faith in the younger, more dynamic batsmen who have grown up with Twenty20. England bowler Stuart Broad appeals during the fifth Test against India at the Kia Oval in August . Bowler Jimmy Anderson (right) appeals for lbw against India during the summer Test series . Why, for instance, has it taken them so long to get James Taylor in the side when he has consistently delivered the goods at a high level of domestic one-day cricket? Alex Hales may have been ‘found out’ to an extent but England have to be bold and back their one-day players with the same loyalty they have shown their Test players. That means understanding that the peaks and troughs are more extreme with younger players and understanding that they must be given a decent run in the side to show that they can adapt and grow into international cricket. As it is, Test batsmen who play so much international cricket that they don’t have time to work on their one-day skills are having to do just that with a World Cup on the horizon, and that’s all wrong. The fact that Cook is still having to work out his best way to play spin in one-day cricket is a disgrace. England’s best Test players, such as Cook and Ian Bell, do not play enough white-ball cricket either domestically or around the world, and that means they are standing still while other nations are enhancing their one-day skills. Captain Cook reacts as England disappointingly go on to lose the series in Sri Lanka . Cook (left) hits a shot as Sri Lanka wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara (centre) and Mahela Jayawardene watch . Another recommendation of the Schofield Report was that the calendar should be changed to avoid World Cups following Ashes series and while that has been done this time I can’t think of worse preparation than a seven-match, 50-over series in Sri Lanka. All that was ever going to do was show up England’s shortcomings and affect their confidence, which is exactly what has happened. It would have been far better if all England’s players had gone off to play in the Big Bash in Australia — if they had been able to get contracts — because that is the type of limited-overs cricket that England must play if they are ever to make an impact. As it is, we are still far too ‘English’ in the way we play one-day cricket and it is difficult to see that being the way forward at this World Cup. With or without Alastair Cook in charge.","England lost the one-day international series 5-2 against Sri Lanka .

"Liverpool's players ensured Brendan Rodgers' reputation for encouraging possession football received a timely boost against Bournemouth as they put together a stunning 51-pass move for their opening goal of the game. Raheem Sterling, playing as a central striker in the absence of Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert, finished off the slick spell of possession, nodding Jordan Henderson's headed cross into the bottom left corner and out of the reach of Artur Boruc. But more impressive than the 20-year-old's diving header was the passing which preceded it. The Cherries simply couldn't get near the ball. Raheem Sterling (centre) celebrates after scoring the opening goal against Bournemouth on Wednesday . Sterling (right) makes no mistake as he scores the opener for Liverpool in the Capital One Cup clash . This graphic from the MailOnline Sport Match Zone shows the remarkable build-up to Sterling's goal . Defender Kolo Toure, back in the starting XI after beginning Sunday's 3-0 defeat by Manchester United on the bench, began by giving the ball to Steven Gerrard. The Reds skipper moved it on to Dejan Lovren, who in turn found his defensive partner Martin Skrtel as the Championship side scurried around trying to win back the ball. Little did Eddie Howe's men know, this would be the start of a special passage of play which would last almost two-and-a-half minutes and give the Merseysiders the lead in their Capital One Cup quarter-final. Adam Lallana, Lucas Leiva, Philippe Coutinho, Lazar Markovic, Henderson and goalscorer Sterling were all involved in the build-up, before the England man finished off the move with aplomb. In total Rodgers' side completed 51 passes prior to Sterling's finish. And before a tackle from Dan Gosling which broke to the feet of Toure to start the move, the Reds completed another 21.

"There was a new haircut and a new role for Raheem Sterling. The England star, who has played in various positions for Liverpool this season, assumed his latest part – as a lone striker. Here, Sportsmail analyses the 20-year-old’s performance in the 3-1 victory against Bournemouth. Raheem Sterling was used as a lone striker by Liverpool against Bournemouth . Goal threat . Brendan Rodgers' decision to utilise the youngster as a centre-forward has raised a few eyebrows. Surely his talents are best suited to creating rather than scoring goals? It took Sterling 20 minutes to make a mockery of that claim. The way he found space in the area to nod home Jordan Henderson's cross - his first headed goal for the club - was reminiscent of bygone Liverpool No 9's. Sterling scored his first headed goal for Liverpool on Wednesday night . The way he took his second of the night echoed that sentiment. He had five shots inside the first 70 minutes, more than any other player on the pitch. Is his long-term future in the position? Probably not. But he certainly showed enough to convince doubters that it's an idea worth experimenting with. Energy . It's fair to say Sterling has been overused by Liverpool this season. Before the Bournemouth game he had played 1,364 minutes this season - more than any other outfield Liverpool player. The 20-year-old created havoc with his runs and movement against Bournemouth . Name another 20-year-old who carries that burden and workload? You'd be hard-pushed. To be fair, he showed no signs of burnout though, buzzing around the final third looking for pockets of space to create havoc. But there will be a time when Rodgers has to take his starlet out of the firing line. But given Sterling's influence, can he afford to? Movement . Sterling, despite his lack of experience in the role, showed a real understanding of what it takes to play as a centre-forward. Despite his ox-like strength for a man of just 5ft 7ins, holding the ball up isn't going to be one of his main assets. Sterling's pace was a constant threat to the Bournemouth defence . His pace most definitely it is, though. He knows it, too, using it to petrify the Bournemouth rearguard last night, playing off the shoulder of the last defender as he looked to stretch the hosts. Attitude . Sterling's been under the microscope more than usual lately. His 17 matches without a goal ahead of Wednesday's Capital One Cup tie raised more questions. Sterling goes past Baily Cargill on the way to scoring his second goal . He answered those questions emphatically. Even after his second, there was no let-up from the youngster. Demanding the ball at every opportunity, making selfless runs to create space for team-mates and defending from the front. Influence . With Steven Gerrard's impact on games far-less obvious nowadays, Sterling is now Liverpool's 'go to guy'. There's an argument to say that level of pressure is far too great to rest on the shoulders of a man who has only recently left his teens. Sterling is congratulated by team-mates after scoring the first of his two goals . That's how it is, though, he can't escape it. But on the proof of this display it's a mantle he is more than happy to take on. Liverpool were at their most dangerous when Sterling was involved, just like Gerrard in his pomp.

"Chelsea have the highest calibre team in world football when measured in terms of the number of stars who have made full international appearances in 2014. Jose Mourinho’s first-team squad, currently top of the Premier League, favourites for the title and still on course for an historic quadruple, is comprised of a group where almost four in five have played for their countries this year. And those who haven’t, like captain John Terry, are recent full internationals or current age-group internationals. Chelsea, with the likes of Gary Cahill (left) and Cesc Fabregas, have the highest calibre team in world football when measured in terms of the number of stars who have made full international appearances in 2014 . Chelsea’s ‘active internationals’ percentage of players is 78.3 per cent, according to new figures published in a ‘digital atlas’ by expert analysts from the Football Observatory in Switzerland. This places Chelsea at No 1 in Europe - and the world - ahead of Real Madrid in second place. The richest team in on planet football may be able to splash more money than anyone else on stars from Gareth Bale to James Rodriguez but ‘only’ 77.3 per cent of their squad have played full internationals this year. Barcelona are in third place (74.1 per cent), Bayern Munich in fourth (73.1 per cent) and Borussia Dortmund in fifth place (71.4 per cent). Both of those German teams contain multiple members of the triumphant World Cup-winning team this summer. The leading five clubs are followed by three more from England in Manchester City (70.8 per cent), Liverpool (68 per cent) and Arsenal (66.7 per cent), with PSG of France (65.2 per cent) and Zenit St Petersburg of Russia (58.3 per cent) rounding out the top 10. Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United do not appear on the list until 15th place (53.6 per cent, the same as Tottenham - and below Everton (55.6 per cent). The ‘active’ element of the measurement is key because it indicates that the players concerned are at the top of their game, being picked for their countries, not retired, and not merely ‘up and coming.’ United’s ratio of full active internationals is so relatively low because Van Gaal has been forced - or has chosen - to use so many young players this campaign, uncapped as yet by their countries at senior level. Among them are Tyler Blackett, 20, Jesse Lingard, 22, Paddy McNair 19, Tom Thorpe, 21 and 19-year-old James Wilson. Real Madrid are in second place with the likes of James Rodriguez and Cristiano Ronaldo picking up caps . Chelsea’s ‘active internationals’ which includes Andre Schurrle (above) percentage of players is 78.3 per cent . Louis van Gaal's Manchester United side don't feature until No 15 on the list with 53.6 per cent . Premier League squads collectively have a higher ratio of full ‘active’ international players than any other top division in Europe. Of all English top-flight players, 43.5 per cent have played for their countries this year. Germany’s Bundesliga is next best (34.1 per cent) followed by Russia’s top division (26.2 per cent) then Serie A (25.3 per cent), France's Ligue 1 (22 per cent) and La Liga (21 per cent). Within the Premier League, Chelsea are clear of City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Everton, Tottenham and United and then a surprise contender fills eighth place in England - Stoke City, where half the current squad have won full caps this year. West Brom’s multi-national team is next then Southampton. The teams with the lowest amount of active internationals in England are Burnley (15.4 per cent), West Ham and QPR (both 17.9 per cent).

"Floyd Mayweather has once again called out welterweight rival Manny Pacquiao but poured cold water on talk of a fight with Amir Khan because 'no one has heard of him'. Mayweather and Pacquiao's meeting has been five years in the making with speculation now rife that the richest fight in boxing history is close to being made. Khan was hopeful of getting his chance to get in the ring with the American star but the 37-year-old says of the Briton 'his name holds no weight', making the prospective encounter extremely unlikely. Floyd Mayweather insists he is ready for Manny Pacquiao with a May 2 date pencilled in for the biggest fight in boxing history . Mayweather went on to say he wouldn't fight Amir Khan, here pictured arriving back in Manchester, as 'no one has heard of him' A fight between Manny Pacquiao and Mayweather could be worth up to $300million with speculation now rife about the encounter .

Speaking to Boxing Scene after his victory against Devon Alexander in Las Vegas, Khan, who was pictured on Wednesday arriving back at Manchester Airport, said: 'The Mayweather fight, I think, definitely should happen. I have proven myself not once, but twice.' However, the WBA, WBC and Ring champion does not seem impressed with the crowd the Bolton-born boxer draws. 'The other night I think he did 4,000 (attendance), so, Amir Khan, his name holds no weight,' Mayweather told reporters during the World Boxing Council convention. 'No one knows who Amir Khan is, except for people who are involved in boxing. 'My focus is Manny Pacquiao. Let's make it happen.' Mayweather was not happy with the crowd Khan brought in when he fought Devon Alexander on Saturday night . The Bolton boxer arrives at Manchester Airport from Las Vegas triumphant after his victory . Khan lands a left hand during his impressive win on decision against Alexander . Earlier this week, Pacquiao, an eight-division champion and current WBO welterweight holder, said Mayweather had 'nowhere else to run' as talk ramped up about a high-profile fight. As he enjoyed himself on his 36th birthday at home, Pacquiao refused to dwell on the latest rant from Mayweather. 'I don't want to talk and even think about him because it will only spoil my day,' he said prior to his grand celebration. Mayweather admits that talks about the fight are happening behind the scenes and he has pencilled in a May 2 date for who he says will be his next opponent. It is estimated that the fight will gross a minimum $300million. Pacquiao has agreed to take the thin end of the 60-40 split, although there are suggestions that Mayweather may demand an even higher percentage if an agreement is to be finalised. It is probable that the Money Man will insist on fighting in his adopted hometown of Las Vegas as usual.

"Sometimes it can be a lonely existence in goal and Jan Alnwick found his north London baptism no less brutal at one end of the Seven Sisters Road than it was at the other. Having conceded four in a blur at Arsenal on Saturday and it somehow got worse for Newcastle's rookie keeper as he conceded four more at Tottenham. He made a dreadful error for the first, dropping the ball from a corner, which allowed Nabil Bentaleb to put Spurs in control of this Capital One Cup quarter-final. Alan Pardew tried hard not to criticise Alnwick but confessed games swung on moments like that. Tottenham's Nabil Bentaleb celebrates his instinctive goal taking advantage of a Jak Alnwick error to put Spurs ahead 1-0 . Nacer Chadli doubled Spurs' lead straight after half-time with a low driven shot that Alnwick had no chance of saving . Tottenham: Vorm 6; Chiriches 6, Fazio 6, Vertonghen 6.5, Rose 6.5; Bentaleb 6.5 (Capoue 80mins), Stambouli 7; Chadli 6.5 (Dembele 61, 5), Eriksen 7, Townsend 6; Kane 7.5 (Soldado 69, 6) Subs not used: Lloris, Kaboul, Naughton, Lamela . Goals: Bentaleb 18, Chadli 46, Kane 65, Soldado 70 . Booked: None . Manager: Mauricio Pochettino 7 . Newcastle: Alnwick 4; Dummett 5, Coloccini 5, Williamson 5, Haidara 6; Colback 5.5, Sissoko 6.5 (Anita 73, 6); Perez 6, Cabella 4.5 (Vuckic 80), Gouffran 5; Riviere 4.5 (Armstrong 60, 6) Subs not used: Woodman, Satka, Streete, Roberts . Goals: Nil . Booked: Haidara . Manager: Alan Pardew 6 . Referee: Andre Marriner 6 . Attendance: 34,677 . Thirty-four seconds into the second half, Nacer Chadli had lashed in another, this time a crisp strike, arrowed skilfully into the bottom corner. Harry Kane added the third, his 12th of the season, before he was replaced by Roberto Soldado, who pounced for the fourth when Alnwick was unable to hold a routine drive by Christian Eriksen. By the end, it seemed too cruel and, although Soldado needs confidence boosting after his own goal-issues, even the home fans seemed slightly relieved when Alnwick saved from the Spain international near the end. By this point, Tottenham's place in the last four was beyond doubt, Mauricio Pochettino had relaxed on the touchline and the 'Spurs are on their way to Wembley' songs were cautiously aired. Perhaps they were sung with more gusto once the semi-final draw paired them with Sheffield United of League One, although Pochettino seemed unsure which team from Sheffield stood between him and his first appearance at Wembley. For Newcastle, however, another competition slips by and the long quest for silver goes on, and Pardew's most pressing issue as he returns to Tyneside is how to stop this goalkeeping crisis wrecking what was a promising campaign. Tim Krul and Rob Elliot are injured – out until mid-January - and Karl Darlow is on loan for the season at Nottingham Forest, with no recall clause. Alnwick faces a genuine test of his mental strength if there is no help forthcoming from the Barclays Premier League, who have the facility to grant special permission for clubs to make emergency loan signings outside the transfer windows. This seemed to be on Pardew's mind as he made the most of his goalkeeper's shoulder injury through the closing minutes of the game. Alnwick had treatment once and then, when there was another break in play for Mousa Dembele to receive attention, the Newcastle boss nudged his physio to run on again, to check-out the young 'keeper. It is easy to understand Pardew's fears. His only alternative is Freddie Woodman, who is 17 and has even less experience. 'There's no way our 17-year-old should be forced in at this level,' said the Newcastle boss.

Bentaleb (centre) and his fellow Spurs conclude their celebrations and head back for the restart . Rookie keeper Alnwick stands dejected after the error that led to Spurs opener . True, these extreme experiences can build character, but they can also scar young footballers and no-one wants to see Alnwick, who is out of contract at the end of the season, suffer like this. How will he feel in Sunday’s derby, knowing Sunderland will target him? Manchester United will do the same at Old Trafford on Boxing Day. Spurs did it last night, peppering his goal from distance across a slick surface. Alnwick, on only his second senior start, made a solid save to thwart Chadli who had been released by a disguised pass from Andros Townsend. But the mistake which triggered the slide out of the Capital One Cup was totally unforced.

(From left) Benjamin Stambouli and Andros Townsend embrace Kane shortly before the star striker is substituted . Alnwick was all alone as he jumped to catch Eriksen’s high corner kick, only for the ball to slither from his grasp and spill at the feet of Bentaleb, who forced it over the line for his first Tottenham goal. Newcastle had conceded after 18 minutes, just as they had at White Hart Lane in October. Spurs should probably have been awarded a penalty when Kane was tripped by Fabricio Coloccini before half-time, but referee Andre Marriner waved play on. The decision did not influence the result which is a lucky break for Marriner who was heavily criticised for a penalty he awarded to Manchester City in a 1-0 win against Everton, and then found his next appearance to be at Fleetwood, in League One. Newcastle rallied briefly, after going behind, with Michel Vorm keeping out two fierce strikes from the impressive Moussa Sissoko before the break while Emmnuel Riviere and Yoan Gouffran wasted clear opportunities to equalise. While Newcastle’s goalkeeper squirmed in the spotlight, their strikers were in no mood to spare his embarrassment.

Soldado controlled with his first touch of the game and finished with his second after coming on for Kane . Soldado guides the ball beyond Alnwick, who had a night to forget in his first appearance at White Hart Lane . Massadio Haidara consoles keeper Alnwick at the end of the match as Newcastle bow out of the League Cup . Even at 2-0 down, there was a glimpse of an escape but Remy Cabella and Riviere somehow contrived to miss a sitter created by Ayoze Perez. With not a defender in the frame, Cabella was first to the cross at the near-post but his contact was so thin he glanced it away from his team-mate and it flashed wide at the far-post. The White Hart Lane fight-back in October was inspired by Sammy Ameobi’s goal, six seconds into the second half, but this time it was Tottenham who came flying out of the interval. Chadli struck after 34 seconds, cutting across the pitch from left-to-right before unleashing a sweet drive inside the post from just outside the penalty box. Pardew claimed Alnwick would have saved it had it not clipped Fabricio Coloccini’s heel on the way. The goalkeeper did make a decent save from Vlad Chiriches and Massadio Haidara cleared off the line from Jan Vertonghen’s header before Kane and Soldado piled on the misery and Tottenham started to dream of Wembley.","Tottenham's Nabil Bentaleb made it 1-0 in the 18th minute after Newcastle keeper Jak Alnwick dropped a corner .

"Newcastle will appeal to the Premier League in a bid to bring in a goalkeeper on emergency loan after Jak Alnwick injured his shoulder in Wednesday night’s Capital One Cup defeat at Tottenham. He is deputising in the absence of the injured Tim Krul and Rob Elliot, neither of whom is expected to return until the middle of January at the earliest.

"Returned: Scott Stewart, 52, of Rochester, New York, returned the statue . A 52-year-old New York man has returned a marble sculpture he borrowed in the early 1970s to get him through troubled times. Scott Stewart tells the Democrat and Chronicle of Rochester that as a 9-year-old he spent his days at the Rochester Central Library and was allowed to take home art pieces. In 1971, he borrowed a small statue of an owl protecting its babies because it symbolized his mother's efforts to care for him and his brother. The childhood of Scott Stewart, 52, of Rochester was plagued with abuse, but he sought refuge at the downtown library. He says the statue brought him peace during tough times over the years. 'The house I lived in was really horrendous and I wanted to surround it with the comfort of the library,' said Stewart. 'I would always take things back, except this one piece. I felt like I couldn't part with it.' The then nine-year-old boy spent his days perusing items on the shelves and often borrowed art pieces to adorn his home. Though the sculpture wasn't his property, he said the piece brought him strength and peace in turbulent times. 'I hung on to that thing and cherished it,' he said. 'I treated it like it was gold.' This weekend, Stewart finally returned it to the library. 'I felt like after all these years I was finally able to close the door on that chapter,' he said. 'It was quite exhilarating. ' The library didn't fine the Rochester man. A library official says Stewart was looking for a symbol of comfort and he found it at the local library. The statue was welcomed back with open arms and Stewart's fines were pardoned. Attachment: Scott Stewart, 52, of Rochester says the statue brought him peace during tough times over the years.

"New research has laid bare the extraordinary rise in household energy bills over the past decade – despite families using less power. We now pay an average of £410 more a year for our gas and electricity once inflation is taken into account. That’s a massive 52 per cent increase above the general rise in the cost of living and despite energy use in the average home falling by 17 per cent in the same period. Evidence compiled by consumer group Which? shows that the average energy bill soared by 137 per cent in cash terms between 2002 and 2012. Once inflation is accounted for, the average bill rose from £790 to £1,200 in today’s prices – and bills have continued rising ever since. Scroll down for video . New research has laid bare the extraordinary rise in household energy bills over the past decade – despite families using less power . The figures are published at a time of mounting anger that the ‘big six’ energy companies have failed to pass on a sharp fall in the wholesale cost of energy in the past year. Industry analysts say the firms have scope to cut bills by as much as £130, but the firms have refused to act. Industry regulator Ofgem has ordered the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to conduct an inquiry into the industry amid fears firms are rigging the market and profiteering. It says they need to explain to customers why they have failed to pass on the fall in wholesale costs. However, it has no powers to force them to do so. The increase in the average annual bill is all the more remarkable, says Which?, given the fact that average energy use per home has fallen. This reduction can be partly explained by the fact that people have invested in better insulation and energy-efficient household appliances. However, a major factor is that many people, including pensioners, have felt it necessary to ration their heat and light in order to protect themselves from spiralling tariffs. Which? said: ‘With such a massive rise in energy bills over the past decade, big reforms are needed to restore confidence in the energy industry and guarantee fair prices.’ The organisation has begun a Fair Energy Prices campaign and is calling on the CMA to establish benchmark prices for gas and electricity that suppliers can aim to beat. It said the firms should also be required to use simple, directly comparable pricing so people can more easily compare prices and make the best choice if they switch. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘At a time when rising energy prices are consumers’ number one concern, it is shocking that people are paying more despite using less. Sources at the ‘big six’ energy firms have suggested that one reason they have refused to cut tariffs is the threat of a price freeze should Ed Miliband win the General Election next May . That’s why it is all the more urgent that regulators and government act to give consumers confidence that the price we are paying for our energy is fair. Major reforms are needed to restore trust in the industry and to guarantee fairer energy prices for consumers.’ Recent figures from Ofgem show that the average profit margin firms make from customers has more than doubled in the past year from £48 to £102. The rise is largely because they have failed to pass on the fall in wholesale prices. Sources at the ‘big six’ energy firms have suggested that one reason they have refused to cut tariffs is the threat of a price freeze should Labour win the General Election next May. They say they will not cut their prices this side of a vote if they are then forced to maintain these lower tariffs by a new government. The net effect is that prices are being artificially inflated, which will leave many having to choose between heating and eating through the coming winter. The higher prices are also handicapping British industry by driving up their costs, which is bad news for the wider economy. Energy UK, which speaks for suppliers, said firms buy ahead to even out ‘peaks and troughs’ in global prices and it can take time for bills to catch up when wholesale prices fall. A spokesman said: ‘The energy industry works hard to protect consumers from changes in price. ‘Energy prices are influenced by a number of factors, including wholesale prices, network costs and Government levies. This means four fifths of the average bill are outside of suppliers’ control. ‘Customers have more and more ways to take control of how much gas and electricity they use. ‘Smart meters also help customers see exactly what gas and electricity is being used.’ Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - reviewing deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts. If you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year. Remember, suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. Don't forget, prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison to find the best price.

"Steven Gerrard and Martin Skrtel went into the clash against Bournemouth walking a disciplinary tightrope. Securing a place in the Capital One Cup semi-finals would have been paramount in the Liverpool duo's mind. But so was Sunday's crunch Premier League clash against Arsenal, with the pair just one booking away from a suspension. It didn't stop the Liverpool skipper throwing himself into a dicey lunge on Simon Francis inside the opening 10 minutes. Steven Gerrard, challenging Yann Kermogant, was committed as ever despite walking a disciplinary tightrope . He only lives round the corner, so it was no surprise Tony Pulis was at Dean Court on Wednesday night. The 56-year-old was doing some punditry work for BBC 5Live for Wednesday's quarter-final. Pulis has been out of work since leaving Crystal Palace just days before the start of the Premier League season. Knowing Pulis, he'd much rather be in the dug out than the press gantry. Former Crystal Palace boss Tony Pulis was doing punditry work at his old club Bournemouth for BBC 5Live . While some saw this tie as the opportunity for another slip-up by Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool, their victory at the Goldsands Stadium had a sense of inevitability about it. That might be down to their impressive goalscoring record at this stage of the League Cup. The Reds had scored in 14 of their last 15 League Cup quarter-finals - Raheem Sterling and Lazar Markovic  struck early on to extend that record and help them reach the last four. Discipline starts at an early age at Bournemouth. The Championship club have enforced a set of strict rules for their academy players, one of which is a £20 fine for inappropriate posts on social media sites. Other fines include £10 for having a mobile phone switched on in the dressing room, and £20 for a breach of curfew. Sportsmail's Neil Ashton snapped this photo of Bournemouth's youth team fines at the Goldsands Stadium . No matter the outcome, Bournemouth knew they were making history against Liverpool. The encounter was the Cherries’ first League Cup quarter-final. The way Eddie Howe’s side are performing at the moment, it may not be too long before their next. Top of the Championship with promotion looking a real possibility, it seems the only way is up for this very promising Bournemouth side.","Steven Gerrard and Martin Skrtel were a booking away from missing Liverpool's Premier League trip to Arsenal .

"A plus-sized model curious about global perception of beauty decided to give her photograph to 21 different editors around the world to see how they would use Photoshop to 'perfect her.' Colombian-American Maria Southard Ospina told the various editors to 'fix' a woman of her size while upholding the ideals of beauty in their country. Ospina was surprised to discover that in today's weight conscious world, just three out of 21 editors made her appear noticeably thinner. Scroll down for video . USA: The USA gave her a longer and thinner face and also gave her darker, straighter hair . The original: Colombian-American Maria Southard Ospina told the various editors to 'fix' a woman of her size using this original photograph while upholding the ideals of beauty in their country. Ukraine: Ukraine altered Ospina's body weight the most out of all the countries and gave her a noticeably more slender frame and also thinned out her face . Mexico: Mexico also slimmed down the photograph but left some of the fullness in her face while also giving her rosier cheeks and dressing her in a pink corset top . Latvia: The Latvian editor slimmed down Ospina's figure and also gave her a more angular face shape . In her blog entry on Bustle.com, Ospina talks about how Ukraine, Mexico, and Latvia were the only three countries to drastically alter her weight. Editors from India and Sri Lanka tried to make her appear softer and take away part of her self-described 'double-chin.' 'I must admit that when embarking on this experiment, I pretty much assumed that the majority of the editors would quite drastically change my bone structure and weight,' wrote Ospina. One editor from Iceland refused to Photoshop her image at all because they didn't believe in digitally altering photographs. 'I don’t believe in re-touching a person’s natural beauty,' said the editor. The most changed aspect of each photograph was her hair and makeup. India: Editors from India softened her figure and also edited away some of the fullness from her chin . Sri-Lanka: Editors from Sri-Lanka also softened the appearance of her face, minimized some of her chin, and added a flushed cheek and rosy pink lips . Iceland: Ice;and refused to Photoshop the image because they don't believe in altering natural beauty . 'If I was to try to find some correlations between all of them, the closest thing to a common thread would be the changes in hair and makeup. From pink lips to overly-blushed cheeks to intense and striking eye shadow (Italy, I kinda like what you did there!),' she said. Most Photoshop artists edited out her mole, a feature she likes to accentuate because of Marilyn Monroe's iconic facial staple. 'Maybe this eradication of the mole signals that any kind of blemish — even a natural beauty mark — just doesn't fit in with standards of perfection,' she said. Opsina notes that her hair transformation was very varied among different countries. 'Bulgaria, Macedonia and Bangladesh all did pretty unusual and striking things,' she wrote. Italy: Italy didn't do much to alter Ospina's frame but they added some dramatic makeup to give her a more glamorous look and even left the mole on her face . Bulgaria: Bulgaria gave Ospina lighter and longer hair and paired the look with neutral toned cosmetics . Macedonia: Macedonia handed in two vastly different Photoshop images to Ospina's surprise . Bangladesh: Like Macedonia, Bangladesh had two varying interpretations of beauty when editing the photo . Uruguay: Uruguay darkened her skin and gave her more defined cheekbones and a more slender nose . She noted that femininity isn’t defined the same way in every country and that in some edits her hair appeared longer and shinier while other edits kept her hair short. Canada seemed to take a satirical approach to photo shopping when they gave her a short blonde do and a 'chunky, badly placed sweater.' Ospina posed in the photograph wearing merely a towel and editors were given the liberty to dress her any way they pleased. Ospina says she was shocked when one editor asked her if she was 'porn.' Some countries may have viewed the feminine form as something needed to be covered up while others left her shoulders bare. Despite the range of edits to her original photograph Ospina concluded that natural beauty may be making a reappearance. 'I’ve always wanted to live in a society in which freckles and moles and double chins and natural wrinkles were embraced, rather than hidden away and caked in foundation,' she wrote. Perhaps natural beauty is making a comeback, after all. Australia: The image from Australia has the slightest of changes to the original photograph . United Kingdom: Ospina's boyfriend of England did very little to alter his girlfriend's natural beauty . Canada: Canada may have taken a satirical approach to Photoshopping with this paper-doll like rendering . Vietnam: Vietnam gave Ospina a warmer complexion, thinned out her face a bit, and gave her redder lips . Pakistan: One editor from Pakistan gave her darker redder lips and also added a colorful background to highlight her features while the other dressed her and gave her blue eyes . Jamaica: Jamaica gave her tint a more yellow hue and left her make-up fairly natural .","Colombian-American Maria Southard Ospina told 21 editors to 'fix' a woman of her size while upholding the ideals of beauty in their country .

"A new leaked email written to Sony studio Michael Lynton head shows one producer saying that Denzel Washington does not do well for the company because he is black. In the exchange, written about the Oscar winning star's recent role in the film The Equalizer, the producer says that Washington does not do well at the worldwide box office because of the color of his skin. The producer then blames this on the racism of non-American audiences. Scroll down for video . Harsh statement: A producer said to Sony head Michael Lynton (left) that Denzel Washington (with Amy Pascal and Matt Tolmach) doesn't make money at the worldwide box office because he is black . Makes no sense: The email was about his film The Equalizer, costarring Chloe Moretz (center) and directed by Antoine Fuqua (right), which made half its money overseas . In the email, obtained by Radar Online, the producer 'suggested Sony should avoid casting black actors to appeal to an international market that the producer deemed racist.' Writes the producer of Washington, 'Casting him is saying we’re ok with a double if the picture works.' A double as opposed to a homerun. They then add; 'He’s reliable at the domestic [box office], safe, but has not had a huge success in years. I believe whenever possible the non event pictures, extra ‘bets’ should have a large inherent upside and be made for the right price. Here there isn’t a large inherent upside.' This despite the fact that Washington is not only one of the greatest actors of his generation, but also one of the biggest and most consistent box office stars. Perhaps most shocking though is that this email was written about The Equalizer after the film did incredibly well overseas. As Radar reports, 'Washington’s The Equalizer grossed $191 million at theaters worldwide, with 47% of the ticket sales coming from outside of the United States. The producer then writes, 'I believe that the international motion picture audience is racist — in general pictures with an African American lead don’t play well overseas.' It is unknown who the producer is, and Washington and Lynton have yet to comment on this latest leak. This as the group behind the hack, Guardians of Peace, have been successful in their goal of shutting down Sony's film The Interview, a comedy about the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Sony Pictures Entertainment pulled the planned Christmas Day release of the picture after the hackers threatened 9/11-like terror attacks on cinemas showing the comedy. What's more, the film may never be released at all. 'Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film,' said a spokesperson for the studio Wednesday evening. This despite the fact that the film cost $42million to make and tens of millions to market. Almost immediately, many in Hollywood voiced their concern, with writer Aaron Sorkin saying how upset he was that 'the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists,' and director Judd Apatow explaining the many problems this means for films moving forward. Federal government officials have said that North Korea is behind the hack, as has been assumed for the past two weeks, though they are not expected to formally announce this until later this week. Authorities are also looking into whether or not someone inside Sony helped the hackers.","A new email leaked by hackers reveals that one producer believes Denzel Washington has no worldwide box office appeal because he is black .

"Courting controversy: Missouri state Representative Rick Brattin has proposed a bill that would require pregnant women to get permission from the father before having an abortion . A Republican Missouri state lawmaker has proposed a bill that would require pregnant women to get permission from the father before having an abortion – except in cases of incest and 'legitimate rape.' 'Just like any rape, you have to report it, and you have to prove it,' Brattin told Mother Jones in a statement that sparked outrage among state Democrats. 'So you couldn't just go and say, 'Oh yeah, I was raped,' and get an abortion. It has to be a legitimate rape.' Brattin's comments led to comparisons to former Republican Congressman Todd Akin, also from Missouri, who set off a media firestorm in 2012 when he said that women's bodies have ways of not becoming pregnant from what he called 'legitimate rape.' Brattin told The Associated Press that his statement to Mother Jones referred to what is defined in state law as rape. 'What I was trying to explain is whatever is considered by statute to be a rape should apply in this,' he said. 'I'm not going Akin here and trying to redefine what it is and all that kind of garbage.' The bill is one of several introduced year after year addressing abortion, and many never garner enough support to become law. Still, the Republican-led General Assembly in September overrode a veto by the governor to enact a 72-hour waiting periods for an abortion, which is one of the nation's longest and has no exceptions for rape and incest. Family man: Brattin, 34, said he was inspired to propose the bill when he went in for a vasectomy after welcoming his fifth child and had to obtained a written consent from his wife Athena Elizabeth Brattin (pictured) Hard-core conservative: Brattin, pictured here with Sarah Palin in 2012, said his bill aims to prevent women from using abortions as a form of contraception . Sean Nicholson, the executive director of the progressive advocacy group Progress Missouri, said the bill likely is aimed at drumming up support and fundraising. Familiar tune: Brattin's comments led to comparisons to former Republican Congressman from Missouri Todd Akin, who set off a firestorm in 2012 when he said that women's bodies have ways of not becoming pregnant from what he called 'legitimate rape' Nicholson said a woman might be unable to contact the man who impregnated her, and Democratic state Rep. Stacey Newman of St. Louis said Brattin's bill would put women in abusive relationships at risk. Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, who defeated Akin for the Senate seat, said the time necessary for criminal prosecution of rape would prevent many women from getting abortions. 'This is just a back-door way to eliminate any rape exception, unless the survivor gets a permission slip from her rapist,' McCaskill said in a written statement. She called the bill 'offensive and absurd.' Brattin, who is married with five children, said the bill aims to prevent women from using abortions as a form of contraception, and said he was motivated in part by male friends whose partners had terminated pregnancies without telling them first. 'If you have a father that wants to be a part of that child's life,' Brattin said, 'he should have that right.' The bill, filed December 3, states: 'No abortion shall be performed or induced unless and until the father of the unborn child provides written, notarized consent to the abortion, except in cases in which the woman upon whom the abortion is to be performed or induced was the victim of rape or incest and the pregnancy resulted from the rape or incest. If the father of the unborn child is deceased, the woman upon whom the abortion is to be performed or induced shall sign a notarized affidavit attesting to the fact.' Brattin's proposed legislation makes no provisions for women who are victims of domestic violence. In his interview with Mother Jones, the 34-year-old politician dismissed the issue as not relevant to the subject of abortion. Brattin's proposed legislation makes no provisions for women who are victims of domestic violence. This photo shows the Republican representative surrounded by his wife Athena Elizabeth Brattin and four of his five children . 'What does that have to do with the child's life? Just because it was an abusive relationship, does that mean the child should die?' Brattin, who had his fifth child, a baby girl, earlier this spring, said he was inspired to propose the bill when he went in for a vasectomy and had to obtained a written consent from his wife. The US Supreme Court ruled in the seminal 1992 case Planned Parenthood vs. Casey that it was unconstitutional to require a woman to notify her spouse before she has an abortion.","Missouri state Representative Rick Brattin has proposed a bill that would require pregnant women to get abortion consent from the father .

"Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has not been seen in public since he was arraigned on 30 federal charges in July 2013, when he still bore signs of the bloody standoff with police that led to his capture and the death of his older brother, Tamerlan. On Thursday, he's due to show his face again in court. Tamerlan, 21, still had visible injuries at the appearance 1 1/2 years ago from a shootout with police several days after the April 15, 2013, bombings. His left arm was in a cast and his face was swollen. He appeared to have a jaw injury. In the public eye: Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been charged with carrying out the April 2013 attack that killed three people and injured more than 260. He will be in federal court on Thursday . Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two bombs exploded near the finish line of the marathon. Tsarnaev, who has pleaded not guilty, faces the possibility of the death penalty if he is convicted. Security will be tight in and around the federal courthouse in Boston for Thursday's final pretrial conference, which his lawyers said he would attend. It is the last scheduled court hearing before jury selection begins on January 5. The trial is expected to last several months. Seating a jury alone could take several weeks to a month. On Thursday, prosecutors and defense attorneys are expected to discuss the jury selection process with the judge. Both sides have submitted questions they want the judge to ask potential jurors, who will be selected from a pool of at least 1,200 people. A defense motion to move the trial out of Boston also is still pending. Bombers: Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are seen here on Boylston Street in Boston before they detonated their improvised pipe bombs on April 15, 2013 . Deadly: Runners continue to run towards the finish line of the Boston Marathon as an explosion erupts near the finish line of the race in this photo taken as the second of two devices detonated on April 15, 2013 . Tsarnaev is accused of working with his now-dead brother to place two bombs near the finish line of the 2013 marathon, killing three people and injured more than 260. His trial is scheduled for early 2014 . Earlier this month, Tsarnaev's lawyers argued anew that ""emotionally charged"" media coverage and the widespread impact of the attacks have made it impossible for him to get a fair trial in Massachusetts. U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. rejected Tsarnaev's first request in September to move the trial, ruling that Tsarnaev's lawyers had failed to show that extensive pretrial media coverage of the bombings had prejudiced the jury pool to the point that an impartial jury could not be chosen in Boston. Tsarnaev's lawyers previously said the trial should be moved to Washington, D.C. O'Toole also rejected a defense request that prosecutors turn over evidence about his older brother's possible participation in a 2011 triple killing in suburban Waltham. Three friends of Tsarnaev were convicted this year of hampering the investigation by removing evidence from his dorm room or lying to the FBI. Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev were convicted of conspiracy and obstruction of justice for removing a backpack containing fireworks and other potential evidence while authorities were still looking for the suspected bombers. Another friend, Robel Phillipos, was convicted of lying to federal agents about being in the room. All three are awaiting sentencing.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is being put on trial for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing .

"Authorities have recovered $10 million worth of art — including paintings by Chagall and Diego Rivera — that were stolen in one of Los Angeles' largest art heists. The FBI and Los Angeles recovered nine pieces of art at a West LA hotel in October, and a man was arrested, the Los Angeles Times reported. The works, including Chagall's 'Les Paysans' and Diego Rivera's 'Mexican Peasant,' were among a dozen swiped from the Encino home of a wealthy real estate investor on the morning of Aug. 24, 2008, by a crook or crooks who entered through the unlocked kitchen door, police said. Recovered art: Federal agents and police in Los Angeles have recovered nine paintings worth millions of dollars that were stolen from the home of an elderly couple six years ago, including works by Marc Chagall and Diego Rivera . Found: The paintings were recovered in an FBI sting operation in which a suspect identified as Paul Espinoza, 45, was arrested as he tried to sell the stolen artwork to undercover agents . The elderly residents were in their bedrooms and heard nothing, police said. The case grew cold until this September, when Detective Donald Hrycyk of the LAPD's art theft detail received a tip that a man in Europe known as 'Darko' was seeking buyers for the stolen art, the Times said. Darko 'indicated that he was merely a middleman for an unknown person in possession of the art in California,' Hrycyk wrote in a search warrant. During the ensuing undercover operation, Raul Espinoza, 45, was contacted at the hotel, where he tried to sell the estimated $10 million worth of paintings for $700,000 cash, prosecutors contend. Three stolen paintings remain missing. Espinoza pleaded not guilty in October to receiving stolen property and remains jailed on $5 million bail. Messages seeking comment were left for his public defender, Aparna Voleti, on Wednesday. The Times said Hrycyk sought permission this month to search Espinoza's cellphone for possible photos or communications that could reveal the identities of the thieves involved in the original burglary. Not over: The FBI investigation of the art theft is continuing and additional suspects are being sought. Authorities are also are looking for three additional paintings stolen from the couple's home in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles in August 2008 in a daylight art heist that ranks among the biggest in the city's history .","The paintings were recovered in an FBI sting operation in which a suspect identified as Paul Espinoza, 45, was arrested as he tried to sell the works to undercover FBI agents .
The stolen paintings included works by Hans Hofmann, Chaim Soutine, Arshile Gorky, Emil Nolde, Lyonel Feininger and Kess van Dongen .
The artwork, including pieces by Marc Chagall and Diego Rivera, is worth millions and was taken while the couple was at home .
Both art experts and authorities described the art theft as one of the largest in Los Angeles history ."
"When you settle down over the Christmas period to watch wall-to-wall football in glorious high definition and surround sound, chances are it won't look anything like this. The oldest piece of football footage in existence has been unearthed, offering a brief but fascinating glimpse into the nature of the game in the late 19th century. The 45-second clip from 1898 isn't exactly crystal clear and it appears to show a meaningless passage of play. Oh, and good luck identifying any of the players involved. The grainy, 45-second clip shows a passage of play from Blackburn vs West Brom in 1898 . The clip is the oldest footage of a football match in existence and was filmed by Arthur Cheetham . But nonetheless, the footage of the First Division match between Blackburn Rovers and West Bromwich Albion, played at Ewood Park on September 24, 1898, is a gem of a find. It was discovered in the archives of the North West Film Archive, which is part of Manchester Metropolitan University and is shown here for the first time. Some things haven't changed over the intervening 116 years - Blackburn still play in blue and white halves, while Albion are in stripes. But pretty much everything else has. Ewood Park only held 12,000 in those days and the one visible stand is dwarfed by the terraced houses behind. The referee is in black but dressed from head to toe rather than the short-sleeves and shorts of today. Blackburn won the match 4-1, with goals from Daniel Hurst, John Moreland and two from Thomas Jackson. West Brom's scorer was Ben Garfield. The clip was recorded by Welsh film pioneer Arthur Cheetham and the film used to record it on was over 40ft long. Blackburn won the First Division fixture 4-1 in front of 12,000 fans at Ewood Park . The West Brom goalkeeper takes a breather as the play unfolds in the opposition half . Mr Cheetham was a bit of a celebrity, making over 30 short films of Welsh life at the time. His Ewood Park film was noted at the time by the Rhyl Record and Advertiser newspaper. They wrote on September 24, 1898: 'We understand that Mr. Cheetham has during the past week been making a new Camera for taking Animated Photographs, which will be capable of running off 1,000ft of film at once. 'He has arranged to take a picture of the League Match, Blackburn Rovers versus West Bromwich Albion, at Blackburn on Saturday next, having obtained special permission of the club.' The footage was found in the North West Film Archive, which is part of Manchester Metropolitan University . Among those playing that day was West Brom's Billy Bassett, a right winger who was quick and agile with his tiny 5ft 5in frame. He scored 61 goals in 261 League appearances for the club and later, as director, helped save them from folding because of financial problems. More than 100,000 people lined the streets of West Bromwich for his funeral procession in 1937. Blackburn had their own stalwart named Bob Crompton, who was dubbed by some as 'the greatest Rover of them all'. He made 529 club appearances at full back and also played 41 times for England, holding the record for the most number of caps until Billy Wright surpassed him in 1952. Compton also managed the club between 1926 and 1930, helping them to win the FA Cup in 1928.

"A New York City jail guard was convicted of a civil rights charge Wednesday after a jury concluded he ignored the pleas of a dying Rikers Island inmate who had swallowed a toxic soap ball. Terrence Pendergrass, 50, shook his head repeatedly as the verdict was announced in Manhattan federal court after a one-week trial. A jury deliberated less than a full day before concluding Pendergrass deprived Jason Echevarria of his civil rights while Echevarria, suffering from bipolar disorder, was in a solitary confinement cell for mentally ill inmates after suicide attempts. Echevarria died in August 2012 after swallowing the detergent soap ball that he was given for cleanup after a sewage backup caused his and other cells to flood. Going to court: Terrence Pendergrass was found guilty of depriving a mentally ill inmate his civil rights by deliberately ignoring him as he screamed for help after eating a ball of caustic soap . Authorities said two correction officers and a pharmacy technician became concerned after the inmate told them he'd swallowed the caustic cleaning agent, but Pendergrass ignored attempts by the officers to get help for Echevarria, who was held on a burglary charge. Left unattended for hours, Echevarria was discovered dead the following day. The prisoner's father, Ray Echevarria, 68, said after the verdict was announced that it was 'a sad ending.' Prosecutors said other inmates heard Echevarria crying for help after he swallowed the detergent known as a 'soap ball.' 'I can't bring my son back,' he said. U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams set sentencing for April 17, when Pendergrass could face up to 10 years in prison. Pendergrass's lawyer, Sam Braverman, said he would appeal the verdict, which he said was not supported by the evidence in the case. Victim: Jason Echevarria swallowed a so-called prison soap ball made of corrosive ammonium chloride in 2012 and died in agony because Pendergrass failed to act by getting him medical attention . Braverman suggested that jurors may have been influenced by protests in New York over recent cases of alleged police misconduct, including in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island. 'It made it a very tough time for a law enforcement officer to be on trial,' he said. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement that the conviction and 'systemic, institution-wide reforms' his office is pursuing should prevent similar deaths in the future. 'Our efforts to reform Rikers Island continue,' Bharara said. The conviction came on the same day that New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ended the city's longstanding practice of sending 16- and 17-year-old inmates to solitary confinement for breaking rules. Last week, another Rikers guard, Austin Romain, was convicted on federal charges of accepting thousands of dollars in cash bribes to smuggle marijuana and other contraband into the prison for inmates. Last month, former Correction Officer Khalif Phillips was sentenced to three years in prison after his conviction for narcotics-related offenses involving some of the same individuals as Romain. Massive complex: The federal case against Pendergrass comes during a time of increased scrutiny at Rikers, a massive jail complex that Mayor Bill de Blasio has described as deeply troubled and in dire need of reform .","A New York jury Wednesday convicted Terrence Pendergrass, 50, on a civil rights charge for ignoring dying inmate Jason Echevarria .

"Many Hollywood stars, and Newt Gingrich, are discussing how upset they are with Sony's decision to not distribute their new film The Interview following threats from hackers who have been releasing internal information and emails over the past two weeks. Sony Pictures Entertainment pulled the planned Christmas Day release of the picture after the hackers threatened 9/11-like terror attacks on cinemas showing the comedy. And now, many are making it public how upset they are with Sony. Scroll down for video . Hold on now: Political loudmouth Newt Gingrch (above) is very upset Sony will not be releasing The Interview . Let it out: Gingrich took to his twitter to voice his concern about what this decision meant . 'No one should kid themselves. With the Sony collapse America has lost its first cyberwar. This is a very very dangerous precedent,' wrote Gingrich on Twitter. He then said, 'Sony should release ""the Interview"" online for free so North Koreans can't censor American creativity--should have Korean language version.' Many in Hollywood are also not happy with the decision to cancel the film, and also took to Twitter to express their frustration and anger. 'Wow. Everyone caved. The hackers won. An utter and complete victory for them. Wow,' wrote Rob Lowe. He later added; 'Saw @SethRogen at JFK. Both of us have never seen or heard of anything like this. Hollywood has done Neville Chamberlain proud today. Gingrich actually responded to Lowe, saying, 'it wasn't the hackers who won, it was the terrorists and almost certainly the North Korean dictatorship, this was an act of war.' Lending support: Rob Lowe (above) tweeted about how upset he was that the fil;m would not be released after seeing star Seth Rogen at the airport . Zach Braff also weighed in, writing; 'Canceling ""The Interview"" seems like a pretty horrible precedent to set.' Aaron Sorkin, who was the subject of many of the emails released in the hack, also spoke about Sony's decision. 'Today the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists who threatened to kill moviegoers in order to stop the release of a movie,' he said in a statement. 'The wishes of the terrorists were fulfilled in part by easily distracted members of the American press who chose gossip and schadenfreude-fueled reporting over a story with immeasurable consequences for the public–a story that was developing right in front of their eyes. My deepest sympathies go out to Sony Pictures, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and everyone who worked on The Interview.' Heavy hitters: Big name writer Aaron Sorkin *(left) and director Judd Apatow (right) both released long statements about how upset this incident made them . Short and sweet: 'No bulls*** though, this is seriously f***ed and it's such a sad day for free speech,' said Amy Schumer (above) of Sony's decision . Seth Rogen, spotted at LAX on Wednesday with a bodyguard after threats of a September 11-style attack on movie theaters that showed the 'The Interview' In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, director Judd Apatow voiced his concern about where the film industry goes from here. 'What do they do when someone says the same thing about the James Bond movie or Annie?' he asked. 'There may be credible evidence of imminent violence that I don’t know about. But if they don’t really have that information, how many movies are they willing not to release? 'Our community is based on freedom of expression. Are we going to suppress ourselves every time someone posts something online? It’s a dark future.' Steve Carrell kept it brief, saying on Twitter, 'Sad day for creative expression.' Carrell also suffered a loss today as a film he was working on about North Korea, Pyongyang, will no longer be made. Amy Schumer also kept it brief, and vulgar, writing; 'No bulls*it though, this is seriously fuc*ed and it's such a sad day for free speech. Frightening.' Stephen King compared the entire thing to censorship; 'Sony's decision to pull THE INTERVIEW is unsettling in so many ways. Good thing they didn't publish THE SATANIC VERSES.' The film may now never be released at all. 'Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film,' said a spokesperson for the studio Wednesday evening. This despite the fact that the film cost $42million to make and tens of millions to market. Almost immediately, many in Hollywood voiced their concern, with writer Aaron Sorkin saying how upset he was that 'the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists,' and director Judd Apatow explaining the many problems this means for films moving forward. Federal government officials have said that North Korea is behind the hack, as has been assumed for the past two weeks, though they are not expected to formally announce this until later this week.

It cost Leeds United the chance of recording their first win in eight games and manager Neil Redfearn cut a frustrated figure after his first match at Elland Road since being made the club's permanent manager. 'I thought it was a really harsh decision. What I would say is that referees have to be more consistent,' he said of the penalty award. 'There are a thousand incidents like that and to isolate one looks unfair. I have seen it again briefly and it looked like they were both at it. 'The same thing happened in the Charlton penalty area and if you give them all, the game will end up seven-all.' Bellusci has already collected one red card and five yellows since signing from Italian club Catania in August and his late intervention did spoil Redfearn's big night as the proper boss after four spells as caretaker. Twice, 19-year-old Alex Mowatt had given Leeds the lead with terrific long-range strikes, a fitting goalscorer as he was one of the youngsters developed by Redfearn at the club's academy. But it is a sign of Massimo Cellino's Leeds at the moment that every forward step is met quickly with a backward one. No sooner had Mowatt put Leeds ahead early in the second half than goalkeeper Marco Silvestri allowed Gudmundsson's shot to go through his legs at the near post. Charlton's Tal Ben Haim is hauled down by Giuseppe Bellusci (right) to give Charlton a late penalty . Then when Mowatt repeated his magic to score from 25 yards, another of Cellino's Italian imports showed indiscipline at a time when officials are looking out for shirt-pulling following the Mail's Hands off in the Box campaign. Cellino, who has sacked three managers since buying Leeds in April, was at Elland Road to see his latest appointment take charge. Charlton manager Bob Peeters said: '2-1 for us was more justified than 2-1 to them. But you can't do anything when a player (Mowatt) has a shot like that from 25 yards, you can only applaud. Johann Gudmundsson sends Marco Silvestri the wrong way from the penalty spot . 'I didn't see the penalty at the end because I was looking at one of my player Rhoys Wiggins who had an injury. But we deserved a result.' Charlton have drawn nine of their 16 Championship games. Redfearn will have to pick his side up again. 'We are a wounded animal. I am dragging them back into the world,' he said. 'I want better than OK. I am not going to let them rest.' Gudmundsson celebrates after his second goal of the night earned Charlton a point .","Academy product Alex Mowatt scores two stunning strikes for Leeds .

"Neil Redfearn's first game as the permanent Leeds manager ended in a 3-1 defeat as Cardiff continued their revival under Russell Slade. Bruno Manga's first Cardiff goal and Federico Macheda's strike put the Bluebirds in control. Alex Mowatt gave Leeds hope by pulling one back 13 minutes from time, but Kenwyne Jones made the points safe when he pounced on a defensive mix up to slot home his sixth goal of the season.

Goals: Mowatt (77) Unused subs: Taylor, Tonge, Montenegro, Cooper . Referee: Andy Woolmer . Attendance: 24,220 . Redfearn's full-time appointment was confirmed prior to kick-off, with the 49-year-old handed an initial 12-month contract with an option for a further year or a return to his academy duties once that period is over. He is already the third manager to take the helm of the Yorkshire club this season, and Leeds fans will hope he can have the sort of stabilising effect Slade has had at Cardiff. Bluebirds fans will have some sympathy with the current plight of their Leeds counterparts given the headlines their club has had to endure under Vincent Tan's ownership. But they are back on track after three wins out of four under Slade, moving them to the brink of the play-off places. While United showed no lack of fight, Cardiff had the better of the opening exchanges and rarely threatened to relinquish control. As early as the 11th minute Marco Silvestri had to get down low to his left to keep out Peter Whittingham's free-kick, with the keeper also clawing away Anthony Pilkington's header from under his own bar. An error between Marco Silvestri (left) and Giuseppe Bellusci (right) allows Kenwyne Jones to score . Substitute Jones (pictured) celebrates after wrapping up three points for Cardiff . Goalscorer Federico Macheda (left) of Cardiff evades the challenge of Stephen Warnock (right) The visitors should have led in the 20th minute, but their best chance of the game was spurned by Steve Morison. The Wales striker powered a header over the bar from 10 yards out after being found by Stephen Warnock's superb centre. Souleymane Doukara struck an effort straight at David Marshall from distance, but the better opportunities were coming at the other end. Anthony Pilkington (left) of Cardiff holds off the challenge of Leeds' Jason Pearce (right) Adam Le Fondre twice failed to make the most of good deliveries from Whittingham, glancing two headers well wide of the target, while Macheda's shot was well blocked by Guiseppe Bellusci after John Brayford had led a sharp Cardiff break. The second half settled into the same pattern and it was no surprise when Cardiff took the lead. Leeds failed to clear a cross and when Sean Morrison headed Craig Noone's cross back across goal, Manga was there to direct the ball into the bottom corner. Leeds chairman Massimo Cellino looks on during the Championship match against Cardiff . Six minutes later and the points looked secure when Macheda drove forward and powered his third goal in four games into the top corner, with the help of a deflection off Jason Pearce's boot. But Leeds found a way back into the game when Doukara got away from Fabio and picked out Mowatt for the midfielder to fire an angled drive across Marshall. However, any hope of a comeback was sunk when a mix-up between Silvestri and Bellusci allowed Jones a simple finish.","Bruno Ecuele Manga gave Cardiff the lead with half an hour to play .

"A dentist whose patient died after developing complications while getting 20 teeth pulled has been suspended until a comprehensive review. The Connecticut State Dental Commission voted 5-0 Wednesday to suspend the license of Dr. Rashmi Patel, who has offices in Enfield and Torrington, after finding that he didn't properly care for two patients, including the woman who died in February. Patel, 45, of Suffield, denied wrongdoing in both cases. His license was temporarily suspended in April pending a final determination by the commission. Dentist Rashmi Patel has has his practicing license suspended pending a comprehensive review after finding he didn't properly care for two patients, including a woman who died in February while having 20 teeth removed . Sad story: Mother-of-two Judy Gan, 64, lost consciousness in the dentist chair while undergoing a complex procedure to have 20 teeth extracted at once. She later died . Under the discipline, Patel's license will be suspended until he successfully undergoes a review of his practice by the American Association of Dental Board, which may take several months. He also will be permanently banned from performing conscious sedation, and he will be on probation for five years after the license suspension is lifted. David Tilles, a lawyer for the state Department of Public Health, recommended that Patel's license be revoked, telling the commission that Patel's practice 'was and is a threat to the safety of his patients.' Patel declined to comment. Asked whether Patel will appeal to state court, his lawyer, Paul Knag, said he and his client will be discussing their next steps. Hearing: Dentist Rashmi Patel, center, sits with supporters at a hearing of the Connecticut State Dental Commission in Hartford, Connecticut . 'Based on the evidence, these charges should have been dismissed,' Knag told the commission. 'He didn't act in a reckless manner. He acted based on what very distinguished experts thought was appropriate.' The commission found that Patel improperly cared for 64-year-old Judith Gan of Ellington at his Enfield office on February 17, when he was to extract 20 teeth and perform six implants. Dr. Rashmi Patel has his dentist license suspended. Officials said Patel failed to respond appropriately when Gan’s oxygen levels dropped and should not have planned so many procedures on her in one office visit . Officials said Gan's oxygen levels dropped during conscious sedation after her teeth were pulled and she later died at a hospital. The commission ruled that Patel failed to properly respond to Gan's decreasing oxygen levels, her respiratory distress and her cardiopulmonary distress. The commission also found that Patel should not have attempted to perform so many procedures on Gan in one office visit, given that her medical history included a heart attack six months before the visit, two strokes within the previous two years and medication that could have affected her response to the sedation. Patel also violated care standards in December 2013 when another patient under conscious sedation to have teeth extracted inhaled a piece of gauze called a 'throat pack' designed to protect him from swallowing foreign objects, the commission found. The patient began flailing, his blood pressure became high and he was rushed to a hospital, but recovered. The panel also concluded that Patel on several occasions improperly delegated sedation to assistants not trained for such a procedure. Richard Kenny, a lawyer for Gan's husband, Michael Gan, said his client wanted Patel's license revoked, but believes the discipline handed down Wednesday was severe and addressed the problems. Kenny said Michael Gan plans to sue Patel over his wife's death.

"This enormous pentagram etched into the ground next to a lake in an isolated corner of Kazakhstan, has had conspiracy theorists all of a flutter after it appeared on Google Earth. The five-pointed star symbol which measures some 366 metres in . diameter, is situated on the southern shore of the Upper Tobol Reservoir . in the north of the country. Pentagrams are commonly associated with devil-worship, but are also used in the Bahai religion and Chinese Taoism as well as neopaganists and followers of the Greek mathematician Pythagoras. Work of the devil? The Kazakhstan pentagram pictured on Google Earth, is situated next to a reservoir in the north of the country . Location: The strange symbol is situated 12 miles west of the town of Lisakovsk . But quite what the symbol, which is visible on Google Earth here, is doing in such a remote location remains a mystery. While some have jumped to the conclusion that it is obviously the work of a secretive satanic cult, others believe it could be the remains of a Russian military base. The symbol, consisting of a five-pointed star inside one or two circles, is often associated with satanism . One internet user, Kurt Yates, from Seattle, Washington, posted on the Live Science website: 'It's probably an abandoned surface to air missile site. 'I was a military pilot and these things are all over the place in areas that use(d) Russian (Soviet) air defense systems. 'The shape has something to do with how their tracking radars work. 'Considering the size of it and the proximity to the Baikonur Cosmodrome, I'd say it possibly was used for tracking Soyuz rockets or some such.' The satanic link is further strengthened by the fact the spot has been highlighted on Googlemaps by two users called 'Adam' and 'Lucifer', both of which are names associated with the devil. The pentagram was used as a Christian symbol in ancient times to represent the five senses and to symbolise the five wounds of Christ. It was also believe to protect against demons. Neopagans, such as wiccans, use it as a symbol of faith similar to the Jewish Star of David. The circle is said to represent unity and protection. Satanist pentagrams, are commonly drawn with two points up and the head of a goat inside and are referred to as the Sigil of Baphomet. They are associated with fallen angels and are used as a sign of rebellion or religious identification. The three downward points are supposed to represent the rejection of Trinity. Military link? One theory is that the pentangle is the remains of a Russian tracking station used to monitor Soyuz rockets .

Despite having designers bending over backwards to dress Prince George, Kate has been flying the flag for traditional British brands. In his charming Christmas portrait, the 16-month-old wore a pair of corduroy shorts and socks by Amaia Kids. Scroll down for video . Super fans: The Duchess of Cambridge, 32, popped into a local Chelsea boutique to snap up some clothes for Prince George and the shop owners said she is a 'lovely and down to earth' lady .

The co-owners, whose shop is located in Kate's stomping ground of Chelsea Green, say they are 'delighted' that the Royal chose to dress her son in their designs. Speaking to MailOnline about George wearing the £36 Griotte shorts and £7 socks, Amaia Perso, the shop's co-owner, said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge has been visiting our shop regularly ever since George was a little baby. 'We feel really proud and honoured. We are a small brand and she could have taken her pick of any brand, so we are really really grateful to her for picking us.' Within moments of Prince George's latest photos appearing online, the tills at Cath Kidston were ringing as parents rushed to get hold of the 16-month-old's £32 tank top. Then, sales of the Start-Rite shoes he wore went through the roof, too. Discussing Kate's style, Amaia said: 'She always gets it right and picks the right outfit for the right occasion' No doubt Amaia Kids will be reaping the rewards of the royal touch - and, say the owners, they couldn't pick a better brand ambassador. 'I love the Prince's style,' Amaia said. 'It's classic, cute and he is very suitably dressed as a royal baby. It's great that he wears so many British high street brands.' The boutique's workers are huge fans of Kate, too. Amaia added: 'My business partner Segolene and the girls at the store have met Kate and they always say what a nice, lovely and down-to-earth person she is.' Discussing the pregnant Royal's style, she said: 'I think she always gets it right and picks the right outfit for the right occasion. She always looks fantastic and I love the way she mixes high-end fashion staples with high street brands.' Kate, pictured in New Zealand in April with Prince George, 'always makes the right style choices' It seems that the 32-year-old Duchess has been swapping children's style notes with her brother James's girlfriend, Donna Air. TV presenter Donna has been shopping for her daughter in the store, as has Geri Haliwell, Kate Hudson, Sienna Miller and Claudia Schiffer. The world's most stylish celebrity offspring, Harper Beckham, has also worn designs by Amaia Kids. Prince George on Wednesday arrived at Buckingham Palace to kick off the Christmas festivities. Prince George was driven in with his parents, seated alongside nanny Maria Teresa Borrallo.

George, who was adorably smiley as he peered out of the window, is due to celebrate his second Christmas at Sandringham next week - and his last as an only child. The 16-month-old royal and his parents are also due to relocate to Anmer Hall on the Sandringham Estate where an extended nursery big enough for two babies has been prepared. George's new sibling is due in April and will live with his or her parents and older brother at the Norfolk property. The little prince will also have to share his nanny, who is expected to help care for the new arrival. Carole and Michael Middleton, who have spent a considerable amount of time with Prince George over the last year, are also expected to take a hand in raising the new arrival and will join the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at Anmer Hall on Boxing Day.","Pregnant Kate, 32, picked up clothes for George at Amaia Kids .

"Men and women across the world are living six years longer than they did a generation ago. A major new analysis - the Global Burden of Disease study - today revealed men are living 5.8 years longer than they did in 1990, while women are living an extra 6.6 years. Falling death rates from cancer (by 15 per cent) and heart disease (down 22 per cent) in high-income regions have fuelled the rising life expectancy in these parts of the world. Meanwhile in lower-income countries, rapidly falling death rates for diarrhoea, lower respiratory tract infections (conditions that affect the lungs, such as pneumonia) and neonatal disorders have helped prolong life expectancy. Scroll down for video . The top 50 causes of global years of life lost in 1990 and 2013, according to new Global Burden of Disease study. Men are living 5.8 years longer than they did in 1990, while women are living an extra 6.6 years. Falling death rates from cancer and heart disease in high-income regions have fuelled the rising life expectancy in these parts of the world. Meanwhile in lower-income countries, rapidly falling death rates for diarrhoea, lower respiratory tract infections, and neonatal disorders have helped prolong life expectancy . But as life expectancies are increasing throughout the world, there is one notable exception. In southern sub-Saharan Africa deaths from HIV and AIDS have wiped more than five years off life expectancy. While worldwide deaths from HIV/AIDS have declined substantially every year since its peak in 2005, the conditions are still the greatest cause of premature death in 20 of 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the study found. The top ten leading causes of premature death worldwide have hardly changed since 1990. Nine causes remained in the top ten in 2013, with HIV/AIDS moving in and tuberculosis moving to 11th. Worldwide, since 1990, years of life lost due to HIV/AIDS have increased by 344 per cent, drug disorders by 119 per cent, chronic kidney disease by 90 per cent, and Alzheimer's disease by 89 per cent. And the study, reported in The Lancet medical journal, cites war as being the leading cause of premature death in Syria, where an estimated 30,000 people died in 2013. A further 30,000 were killed in the preceding two years. In high-income regions, life expectancy had mostly been increased by falling cancer and heart disease death rates, said the report. There have also been dramatic increases in life expectancy in some low-income countries, experts found. In Nepal, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Niger, the Maldives, Timor-Leste and Iran, life expectancy increased by more than 12 years in the last two decades. Certain causes of death were shown to have increased around the world since 1990. They included liver cancer, drug use conditions, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, diabetes and pancreatic cancer, the study in The Lancet medical journal found. Despite dramatic drops in child deaths over the last 23 years (from 7.6 million in 1990 to 3.7 million in 2013), lower respiratory tract infections, malaria, and diarrhoeal disease are still in the top five global causes of death in children younger than five years. They continue to kill almost two million children between the ages of one and five every year. The global years of life lost to various illnesses (COPD represents the lung condition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Global deaths by age and region in 1990 and 2013. In southern sub-Saharan Africa, deaths from HIV and AIDS have wiped more than five years off life expectancy . Men in the UK increased their life expectancy by the average, rising from 72.9 to 79.1 years between 1990 and 2013. But UK women saw only a 4.4-year increase from 78.4 to 82.8 years. In eastern Europe, half of all premature deaths in 2013 were due to five causes: heart disease, stroke, self harm, cirrhosis, and road injury. Meanwhile half of the word's suicide deaths occurring in India and China alone. In India, life expectancy at birth increased from 57.3 years to 64.2 years for men between 1990 and 2013 and 58.2 years to 68.5 years for women during the same time period. India has made remarkable progress in reducing child and adult deaths with death rates dropping 1.3 per cent per year for adults and 3.7 per cent for children.· . Road injury and  interpersonal violence - violence between people who know each other - are key contributors to premature deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean, ranking in the top five leading causes for 17 and 15 out of 29 countries in the region, respectively. Outside this region, interpersonal violence only ranks in the top five causes in just one other country in the world: South Africa. Lead author Dr Christopher Murray, professor of global health at the University of Washington, US, said: 'The progress we are seeing against a variety of illnesses and injuries is good, even remarkable, but we can and must do even better. 'The huge increase in collective action and funding given to the major infectious diseases such as diarrhoea, measles, tuberculosis, HIV/Aids, and malaria has had a real impact. 'However, this study shows that some major chronic diseases have been largely neglected but are rising in importance, particularly drug disorders, liver cirrhosis, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease.'","Life expectancy has risen by falling deaths from cancer (down by 15%) and heart disease (22%), global study shows .

"Babies born using a new technique to eradicate serious illness would never get to know one of their parents, it has emerged. The Government is pushing for the law to be changed to allow families blighted by incurable disease to have healthy children. It would make Britain the first country in the world to sanction the creation of babies that effectively have three parents – two mothers and a father. Pioneering: Britain is set to become the first country in the world to offer three-parent IVF to beat disease . However the genetic contribution from the second mother would be tiny – just 0.1 per cent – and so the Government has said her identity should be kept secret. This differs from laws covering children born from sperm and eggs donated for regular IVF treatment, who can find out the donor’s identity when they turn 18. Supporters say the legislation would allow those living in the shadow of incurable disease the chance to have a healthy child. But critics argue that genetically engineering eggs crosses a critical ethical line, and are concerned about the impact of children not knowing who their third parent is. Divisive: The plans were unveiled by Public Health Minister Jane Ellison, pictured . Philippa Taylor, of the Christian Medical Fellowship, said: ‘A child must have the right to identify and know who his or her three genetic parents are, if they choose. 'This is already granted to children who are adopted because we understand how important it is for children to know about their genetic heritage for their sense of identity and self-understanding. It should not be denied to these children.’ However Robert Meadowcroft, of the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, said the technique ‘involves a calculated step into new scientific territory, but it is a very focused step, with the sole aim of preventing a potentially fatal condition from being passed down where possible.’ He added that it would open up the ‘possibility of motherhood’ to women afraid of passing on a painful and debilitating condition. The technique, being perfected at Newcastle University, involves trying to prevent disease caused by faults in mitochondria, which cause serious illness in one in 6,500 babies. Scientists have found a way of swapping the mother-to-be’s diseased mitochondria with healthy ones donated by another woman. The technique involves removing the nucleus DNA from a fertilised egg, and inserting it into a donor egg where the nucleus DNA has been removed. The resulting embryo would end up with the nucleus DNA from its parents - making up the vast majority - but the mitochondrial DNA from the donor, amounting to around 0.1 per cent. The proposed change in the law was announced by Public Health Minister Jane Ellison. It will have to be debated and voted on in both Houses but could be passed by the end of January. However, it would not become law until October. The Newcastle team say they are delighted that Parliament is to consider the legislation and say they will soon be ready to treat couples.","Divisive technique means babies have two genetic mothers and a father .

"A homeless woman who was living out of an SUV for weeks with her three children and two grandchildren recently got a big helping hand from a group of concerned Minnesota police. Kim Washington was a woman in a desperate situation. When her relationship in Florida turned violent, she packed up her kids and drove to her Twin Cities hometown. When she got there, she found nowhere for them to stay and bad turned to worse. She thought things were getting even more desperate when police started coming around. Cramped and scared: Kim Washington found herself homeless and living in an SUV after fleeing domestic abuse with her three children and two grandchildren . Desperate situation: Complaint calls poured in from area residents as days the family spent in the vehicle turned to weeks . Even she was shocked at how kind the officers were to her and her family. 'I was very leery of them,' Washington admitted to KMSP. 'Every time I saw them I was like, ""Oh Lord, here they come to harass us."" [But] a lot of them were kind, empathetic, and they understood. I appreciate them.' According to the Pioneer Press, some of the officers would drop by with pizza for the family and books for the 1- and 2-year-old grandchildren. 'It made an awesome difference,' Washington said. 'You don't feel so invisible.' Meanwhile, as the time Washington, her three, 12-,  20-year-old children and her grandkids spent in the SUV stretched from days to weeks, officers began getting more complaints from residents of the St. Paul neighborhood where they were parked. Serve and protect: To Washington's surprise, police who responded to complaints about the family wanted to help Washington, not hassle her . Officers Mary Alberg and Theresa Spencer wanted to find a better, more permanent solution to Washington's problem. 'They were not going to give up on keeping the family together,' Cmdr. Jill McRae, who ended up buying the family a motel for the night, told the Pioneer Press. Alberg and Spencer ended up pitching in some more, giving the family several comfortable days in the motel as they searched for more permanent help. That help soon came thanks to a local TV news story about the family's plight. A connected viewer reached out to the family with help getting into an area shelter that's usually full. Washington is in search of work and says she has experience as a women's advocate in a domestic abuse shelter, a medical assistant and other jobs. Now, as she edges closer to reclaiming her independence, Washington has the police she once feared to thank for the strides she making. 'I wasn't a big fan of the police, but them helping allowed us to view them in a different light and say, 'Yes, they really do want to protect and serve,' she told KMSP. 'It was really nice.' Washington (here with two of her children) and her family were put up in a motel for several nights when police in the area pooled their funds to help her. Now she's found a longer-term solution in the form of a homeless shelter .","Kim Washington and family piled into her SUV and drove from Florida to Minnesota after her relationship turned violent .

"He's not known for being fond of photographers but it seems Prince Harry does at least know his way around a camera - as the photos taken by the royal during a  trip to Lesotho last week reveal.

"Google will reportedly be fined £14.5million for spying on millions of Apple customers.

"Hard-pressed businesses face costly bills after European judges controversially ruled that obesity can be classed as a disability. Companies will be forced to make concessions for overweight staff that could include extra-large office furniture, medical advice or exercise facilities. Firms could also face expensive compensation claims for discrimination if they sack someone for being overweight. Scroll down for video . Obesity can be classed as a disability, the highest EU court has today ruled after 25-stone Danish childminder, Karsten Kartoft, pictured, took action when he was sacked for being unable to tie the shoelaces of the children he was caring for, without the help of a colleague . Important to the landmark ruling is the EU court's judgment that the origin of the disability is irrelevant – even if someone's obesity is caused by overeating. Critics warned it could encourage the overweight to avoid slimming down in the hope of securing a payout. Companies could also face millions of pounds of costs to alter offices and factories, including providing: . The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that obesity qualified as a disability if it 'hinders the full and effective participation of the person… on an equal basis with other workers' when doing their job. Health campaigners and business leaders criticised the ruling, binding across the EU, with one saying it was the closest they had seen to the 'law being an ass'. National Obesity Forum spokesman Tam Fry said: 'This has opened a can of worms for all employers. They will be required to make adjustments to their furniture and doors and whatever is needed for very large people. It will cause friction between obese people and other workers.' The top European court was asked to rule on a case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat. The council allegedly claimed his weight meant he was unable to perform basic duties and even required help from a colleague to tie children's shoelaces. Denmark asked the ECJ to determine whether EU law outlawed discrimination on the grounds of obesity, along with factors such as religion, belief, age or sexual orientation. If a person had long-term medical problems because of their condition, for example joint problems or diabetes, they would be protected by the EU's Employment Equality Directive. But Mr Kaltoft, who has a body mass index of 54 – almost twice the official obesity level – said he did not believe he was disabled. A quarter of adults in Britain are clinically obese. Neil Carberry, of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'Businesses will be looking for a common sense approach to this ruling, as employees need to be able to do their job. It is unclear from the ruling what it would be reasonable to expect employers to do, so the Government will need to work with businesses to establish clear guidelines and avoid unfair costs being levied on firms.' Though Mr Kaltoft claims his weight was mentioned in a meeting discussing his dismissal, his employers deny it was a reason for terminating his contract. The Danish court asked the EU court to specify whether EU law prohibits discrimination on the grounds of obesity and whether obesity can constitute a disability . Body Mass Index, calculated from a person's weight and height, is accepted as a reliable indicator of obesity. According to the World Health Organisation, the ideal BMI for most adults is between 18.5 and 24.9. If a person's BMI is 25 to 29.9, they are classed as overweight. At between 30 and 39.9 they are obese and 40 or over is very – or morbidly – obese. Doctors say being overweight or obese can increase the risk of health problems, including heart disease, strokes, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Earlier this year the European Court of Justice's advocate general, Niilo Jaaskinen, who advises the court, suggested that very severe obesity – classified as a BMI of more than 40 – could be considered a disability. But yesterday's ruling does not state what level of obesity would be classed as 'disabled'. It stated: 'It is for the national court to determine whether [an individual's] obesity falls within the definition of 'disability'.' Jane Deville Almond, chairman of the British Obesity Society, said obesity should not be categorised as a disability. She said: 'I think the downside would be that if employers suddenly have to start ensuring that they've got wider seats, larger tables, more parking spaces for people who are obese ... we're just making the situation worse. '[It is] implying that people have no control over the condition, rather than something that can be improved by changing behaviour.' Julian Hemming, employment partner at law firm Osborne Clarke, said: 'This ruling is a real problem for employers. It's still not clear enough for them to be sure that they're going to be on the right side of the law. 'This test could mean that businesses face claims from obese staff for failing to make reasonable adjustments to their role if the job entails tasks where they would be on an unequal footing with other staff – tasks that require full mobility such as stacking shelves in a supermarket. 'Employers will need to consider whether they make adjustments for obese staff to protect themselves from discrimination claims.' Weight loss expert Steve Miller, who presents TV's Fat Families, said: 'The world has gone crazy. It is an insult to those people who are genuinely disabled. 'Being obese is self-inflicted – when people fall into bad habits, we are ourselves responsible to take action to reverse that. 'If we say being obese is a disability, there is a danger it will encourage people to stay fat to enjoy a life on benefits and celebrate the joy of getting a free car parking space.' According to the World Health Organisation, a person is obese if their body mass index – calculated using weight and height – is over 30. Firms will not need to carry out alterations at work in anticipation of employing obese people, but would be expected to deal with individuals on a case-by-case basis.The Disability Discrimination Act already states that businesses must pay for reasonable changes to the workplace to meet the needs of disabled employees, and this enjoys business support. A Government spokesman said: 'Today's judgement does not change anything and does not mean someone can claim benefits simply for being obese.' The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, ruled that if obesity could hinder 'full and effective participation' at work then it could count as a disability .","The European Court of Justice ruled obesity can be classed as a disability .

"Stunning good looks run in the family judging by these exclusive images of Holly Valance's little sister. Olympia Valance, 21, from Melbourne, Australia, has been announced as the new face and body of underwear brand Gossard. And the Neighbours actress told FEMAIL that she soon overcame her fear of stripping off to pose in the Fifties-style corsets and suspenders, saying the lingerie made her 'feel a million dollars'. Scroll down for video . Olympia models Gossard's stunning midnight blue Rochelle basque with its plunging neckline . Olympia, who plays Paige Smith in the long-running soap, told FEMAIL: 'I have never really done any lingerie modelling and, as most girls, thought I'd be a bit self-conscious but the garments are so beautiful that they made me feel a million dollars when I put them on. She admits that wearing the glamorous pieces was also a pleasant diversion from the more casual attire worn by her TV character. 'I wear a lot of sporty stuff on Neighbours and so it's nice to have a change. Although she added: 'I like all sorts of different lingerie - from sports bras to suspenders.' 'I love the retro styles of the new Gossard collections, the high waist and long line bras are so sexy and feminine and feel really good to wear.' Olympia said she's 'proud to fly the flag for real women with real bodies to be proud of'. She added: 'Body image is such an important issue for me and that was one of the reasons I was so excited about working with Gossard. I have younger sisters and nieces and I know how hung up girls can get about the way they look. 'Some of the models you see are just impossibly thin and it creates so much pressure on young girls.' The actress is seen in the brand's Retrolution range in the second of our exclusive images . Olympia was unveiled as the new face and body of the lingerie brand on Tuesday. Former Gossard girls include Sophie Anderton, who posed provocatively in black bra and knickers on a bed of wild grass in 1996. Gossard was crowned the UK's Favourite Lingerie Brand 2014 for the third year running at the UK Lingerie Awards earlier this month. And now it has teamed up with the stunning Australian starlet to launch brand new swimwear and lingerie collections. She said: 'The last year has been a whirlwind and to work with such an established name as Gossard is a dream come true. The actress flew to London - where her sister Holly lives with her property mogul husband Nick Candy - for the campaign. Olympia said: 'I absolutely love working on Neighbours and the fact that I am able to come over to England and do an incredible campaign like this is a credit to the show's following, both here and down under, and I would like to thank everyone who supports us.' Talking about working for the underwear giant, Olympia said: 'Lingerie is such an important, personal purchase for a girl and yet we - me included - buy badly fitting bras more often than we care to admit. Christmas cracker: Olympia appears in a sultry black lace basque with sheer panels and suspenders . 'I am excited about working with Gossard in all their ventures, from helping women to find the size and style that suits them, to collaborating with inspirational charities such as CoppaFeel!, this is something that means the world to me.'

"She may have been fired by Lord Sugar on week seven of The Apprentice, but that hasn't stopped Lauren Riley from pursuing her business dreams. The 28-year-old solicitor, who was fired after an advertising task in New York, is keen to show the world that there's more to her and to dispel the image of a stuffy solicitor from this season's BBC show. Lauren, from London, says she's determined to give the law industry a 'modern and sexier facelift' and encourage women to embrace their beauty as well as their brains. Scroll down for video . Lauren Riley was fired in week seven of The Apprentice but she isn't letting that stop her from getting ahead . So does the entrepreneur, who has been dubbed 'Luscious Lauren', believe that good looks hinder women in business? 'I can imagine situations where this could happen, although I have done my best not to allow myself to be hindered,' she told MailOnline. 'When you are new to any role you will be judged on many factors and unfortunately the first one is bound to be looks. I remember as a trainee solicitor, me and a couple of other female trainees being compared to Girls Aloud. Or the odd comments when we were introduced to the staff floor by floor, that we looked more like models on a catwalk. 'Luckily for us, our warm personalities and competency at our jobs quickly silenced these murmurs. It was only years later that we learnt the full extent of how we had been judged that first day. 'If people think I am good looking then I do not think it hindered me at that time but I'm sure it didn't help either. You definitely have extra pressure to be good at your job and to prove that you're more than just a pretty face.' Hindered: Lauren explains that as a trainee solicitor, she and a couple of other female trainees were compared to Girls Aloud and it was once said that they looked more like models on a catwalk . Despite her strong beliefs, Lauren says she is 'ashamed' to admit that, in the past, she's felt pressure to change the way she dressed in the workplace. She explained: 'When I first started in law I was conscious of power dressing, wearing less make-up and tying my hair back in an effort to be taken more seriously. 'As I have got older and more experienced I have realised that if someone judged me based on anything but my ability to carry out my work then that was their problem.' Lauren, who is 'delighted' by the emails and tweets she receives from younger women who have said she inspired them to look to law or business as a career, wants to help others follow in her footsteps. She has been asked to speak next year by the Junior Law Society and wants to work to inspire young women to go into industries that are particularly male orientated without fear of being intimidated simply because of their gender. 'I would like to see some more positive female women in business who get media attention for the right reasons,' she said. On a mission: While she didn't make the final in Lord Sugar's boardroom, Lauren says she has had plenty of interest in her new app and she wants it to become a  household name . 'Attitudes to women in business need to change, women should feel confident enough to dress how they feel comfortable and embrace their femininity without worrying about being judged. Men never worry about how they look or dress in the work place because they are confident in knowing that they will be judged purely on their work ethic, it should be the same way for women.' Lauren's first port of call is promoting her new start-up, The Link App. Lauren describes her app as the 'ultimate tool for busy law firms looking to thrive in an increasingly competitive market, improve customer service, save time and money, and increase productivity'. While she didn't make the final in Lord Sugar's boardroom, Lauren says she has had plenty of interest in her new app and she wants it to become a global firm and a household name. Meanwhile, back in Lord Sugar's boardroom, after 10 weeks of tasks and a series of gruelling interviews, the two finalists going head-to-head in this year's Apprentice final have been revealed. South Londoner Bianca Miller and Australian Mark Wright will battle it out to become Lord Sugar's next Apprentice during Sunday's final. The pair are fighting for the chance of Lord Sugar's £250,000 investment in their business plans.","Solicitor Lauren Riley, 28, was fired in week 7 of BBC show .

"New DNA analysis claims the Yeti (artist's impression pictured) isn't an ancient polar bear, but instead is a Himalayan bear . It's a mystery that has fascinated scientists and the public for decades: just what IS the ape-like creature - known as the Yeti - said to be stalking the Himalayan mountains? Last year, a geneticist claimed to have solved the mystery when he said the Yeti was a distant relative of the polar bear, thought to have died out more than 40,000 years ago. But new DNA analysis has thrown doubts on this theory. Researchers have shown that the two hair samples analysed actually originate from a modern polar bear, and a type of rare bear native to the high mountain ranges. The analysis suggests that the Yeti is not a previously unseen primate, nor is it a polar or brown bear hybrid as previously thought, but instead a sub-species of the Himalayan bear. The original analysis was carried out by Bryan Sykes, professor of human genetics at the University of Oxford. He set out to collect and test Yeti hair samples to find out which species they came from. In particular, he analysed hairs from two unknown animals, one found in the Western Himalayan region of Ladakh and the other from Bhutan, 800 miles (1,287 km) to the east. After subjecting the hairs to the most advanced DNA tests available,  he compared the results to other animals' genomes stored on the GenBank database. From this, Professor Sykes found he had a 100 per cent match with a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone found in Svalbard, Norway. This jawbone dates back between 40,000 and 120,000 years - a time when the polar bear and closely related brown bear were separating as different species. Professor Sykes believed the most likely explanation was that the animals from which the hairs were taken were hybrids - crosses between polar bears and brown bears. The species are closely related and are known to interbreed where their territories overlap. But, this theory has been questioned due to an error in analysing the data. Researchers Ross Barnett, from the University of Copenhagen, and Ceiridwen Edwards from the University of Oxford looked at the same hair samples that led Professor Sykes. 'We should like to propose an alternative origin for the hair samples,' the scientists said in their paper. Last year, a geneticist analysed hair samples that are said to have been taken from the mysterious Yeti creature.  He said he had a 100%match with a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone and said the Yeti was an ancient relative of polar bear (stock image pictured) crossed with a brown bear . But, doubts have been thrown on this theory. Researchers Ross Barnett and Ceiridwen Edwards looked at the same hair samples analysed by Professor Sykes. They propose that the samples belong to a Himalayan bear - a sub-species of the brown bear that lives in the higher reaches of the Himalayas . 'The Himalayan bear is a sub-species of the brown bear that lives in the higher reaches of the Himalayas, in remote, mountainous areas of Pakistan, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan and India. 'Its populations are small and isolated, and it is extremely rare in many parts of its range.' Professor Sykes acknowledged the error, issuing a statement: 'Importantly, for the thrust of the paper as a whole, the conclusion that these Himalayan Yeti samples were certainly not from a hitherto unknown primate is unaffected.' Last year, in what was the first serious scientific study of the abominable snowman for 50 years, Professor Bryan Sykes from the University of Oxford analysed 30 samples of hair. The hairs had supposedly been shed by yetis, or their bigfoot cousins, and were part of museum and private collections from around the world. Twenty eight of the hairs were genetic matches to known animals from bears to racoons, horses and cows. But two didn't fit the mould. Their DNA matched that recovered from a 40,000-year-old polar bear fossil. One hair was reddish brown and found in a Yeti nest in a bamboo forest in Bhutan, ten years ago. The second was golden brown and taken from a Yeti in Ladakh on the Tibet-India border 40 years ago. But new research suggests Professor Sykes's findings were in fact down to an error in analysing the data. Researchers Ross Barnett, from the University of Copenhagen, and Ceiridwen Edwards from the University of Oxford looked at the same hair samples that led Professor Sykes to make his bold claim. They propose that the previously unexplained samples come from the Himalayan bear - a sub-species of the brown bear that lives in the higher reaches of the Himalayas, in remote, mountainous areas of Pakistan, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan and India. Yetis, also known as the Abominable Snowman, have been recorded for centuries in the Himalayas, with local people and mountaineers claiming to have seen hairy, ape-like creatures. A photograph of a Yeti footprint, taken by British climber Eric Shipton at the base of Everest, sparked global mania after it was taken in 1951. Legendary mountaineer Reinhold Messner, who became the first man to climb Everest without oxygen, has studied yetis since he had a terrifying encounter with a mysterious creature in Tibet in 1986. Yetis, also known as the Abominable Snowman, have been recorded for centuries in the Himalayas (pictured), with local people and mountaineers claiming to have seen hairy, ape-like creatures. A photograph of a Yeti footprint, taken at the base of Everest, sparked global mania after it was taken in 1951 . He uncovered an image in a 300-year-old Tibetan manuscript of a Chemo - another local name for the yeti, with text alongside it which was translated to read: 'The Yeti is a variety of bear living in inhospitable mountainous areas.' Professor Sykes added: 'Bigfootologists and other enthusiasts seem to think that they've been rejected by science. 'Science doesn't accept or reject anything, all it does is examine the evidence and that is what I'm doing.'","DNA test shows Yeti isn't a sub-species of polar bear thought to be extinct .

"Huge reserves of the oldest water on Earth are locked deep within the planet's crust and could be home to new forms of life, according to scientists. Geologists have revealed that they have found water that is up to 2.7 billion years old in sites all over the world. They now estimate that there could be around 2.5 million cubic miles (11 cubic million km) of this water buried beneath the ground. Scroll down for video . Ancient water rich in hydrogen was found to be bubbling to the surface in a gold mine in South Africa . This is more than all of the world's rivers, swamps and lakes put together. The scientists have also found tantalising hints that the highly salty water, which is spread out through tiny vein-like networks through the rock, could be home to life. The water appears to be reacting with the rock to produce large quantities of hydrogen in a similar way to what occurs around deep sea vents. Most people would think twice about consuming something that has been hanging around for more than 2.5 billion years - making it older than some mountain ranges. But Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar could not resist having a taste. Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, she described it as tasting 'terrible' due to the high salt content. Reactions between the water and rock have made the water extremely salty and rich in minerals. She said: 'It is more viscous than tap water. 'It has the consistency of a very light maple syrup. 'It doesn't have color when it comes out, but as soon as it comes into contact with oxygen it turns an orangy color because the minerals in it begin to form — especially the iron.' 'It tastes terrible. It is much saltier than seawater. You would definitely not want to drink this stuff.' They claim that this means the water trapped within the Earth's crust has the potential to support life. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar, a geologist at the University of Toronto, who led the work along with colleagues from Oxford University, said: 'This represents a quantum change in our understanding of the total volume of the Earth's crust that may be habitable. 'It provides a ""treasure map"" of just how many other places on the planet we might want to do hunting for these microbes.' The researchers took samples of water trapped inside the Precambrian shield rocks - the oldest rocks in the Earth's crust - from 19 different mines in Canada, South Africa and Scandinavia. Here they were able to build up estimates for just how much water might be stored down the tiny cracks and pores that have formed in the ancient granite, basalt and quartzite rocks. Such Precambrian rocks make up around 70 per cent of the Earth's crust. In one zinc and copper mine in Timmins, Ontario, the ancient water has been bubbling up to the surface for decades. Noble gas isotopes, which accumulate in the water over time, have allowed the researchers to estimate the age of this water. They believe it has been trapped in the rock for more than a billion years and could even be up to 2.7 billion years old, when the rocks first formed. The researchers estimated the amount of hydrogen being produced by reactions between rocks in the precambrian crust (exposed rock is marked blue while buried rock is marked green) after taking samples of water from mines (marked by yellow dots) in Canada, South Africa, Scandinavia and around Europe . Professor Sherwood Lollar said: 'The waters show us an incredible spectrum of residence times - from tens of thousands of years in age near the surface, to tens of millions of years residence time in the deep gold mines of South Africa, and last year we reported on waters form the Canadian Shield with more than a billion years residence time. 'Investigating them all and finding out where life occurs and how much it differs from one fracture to another will be an extraordinary adventure over the coming years.' She said that the huge quantities of hydrogen rich water in the Earth's crust was a 'sleeping giant' that could be a source of possible energy for life. Water trapped within tiny veins in ancient rock can preserve chemicals from the environment long ago . In 2006 scientists discovered rock and chemical eating bacteria living in Gold mines in South Africa, 1.7 miles (2.8km) under ground. Here the microbes were found to be using hydrogen and sulfates to survive in the salty water that filled tiny fractures. Similar types of bacteria have been found living in the hydrothermal vents that form on the sea bed, allowing entire ecosystems to flourish. Professor Sherwood Lollar and her colleagues believe that there could be entirely new undiscovered forms of life and ancient bacteria living in the viscous salt waters that leak through the oldest rocks in the Earth's crust. Their work, which is published in the journal Nature and was also presented at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union, could also provide clues about where life on Mars, if it exists, could be found. Mars surface consists of rocks that are billions of years old and have the potential to produce hydrogen in the same way as those on Earth. Barbara Sherwood Lollar says she has tasted the water as it is a quick way of finding the saltiest samples . Researchers took samples of the highly salty water in 19 mines around the world to test for hydrogen content . Another recent discovery of flourishing colonies of slow growing bacteria in seams of coal, 8000 feet below the sea bed off the coast of Japan. Professor Sherwood Lollar said: 'If the ancient rocks of Earth are producing this much hydrogen, it may be that similar processes are taking place on Mars.' Her colleague, Professor Christ Ballentine, from the University of Oxford, said it was a surprise to find so much water preserved under ground. He said: 'When you think about what's down beneath your feet, it's more exciting than just some rock. 'Until our most recent work, the hydrogen production in the continental crust was calculated to be negligible. 'This was very wrong and our work shows the hydrogen production in the continental crust to be the equal to that produced in the oceanic crust. 'This doubles the estimate of hydrogen produced on Earth.' A new study has suggested that geological processes could have been responsible for helping to create much of the water on the Earth's surface. While some scientists believe water was first brought to our planet by icy comets from elsewhere int he solar system, Researchers at Ohio State University believe that the early Earth had entire oceans-worth of water trapped in its interior and these have been continually released to the surface by plate tectonics. They believe that the huge pressures on rocks deep inside the Earth's mantle are actually squeezing water out from the dry rock by forcing hydrogen and oxygen atoms trapped inside minerals there to combine. In laboratory experiments, Professor Wendy Panero, an earth scientist at Ohio State University, has been compressing minerals that are common in the Earth's mantel to subject them to high pressures and temperatures. In a paper they presented at the American Geophysical Union fall meeting, they reported how recent tests of the mineral bridgmanite, the most abundant mineral in the lower mantel, does not contain enough hydrogen to play an important role in the Earth's water supply, but two other minerals called Ringwoodite and garnet may. 'If all of the Earth's water is on the surface, that gives us one interpretation of the water cycle, where we can think of water cycling from oceans into the atmosphere and into the groundwater over millions of years,"" said Professor Panero. 'But if mantle circulation is also part of the water cycle, the total cycle time for our planet's water has to be billions of years. 'When we look into the origins of water on Earth, what we're really asking is, why are we so different than all the other planets? 'In this solar system, Earth is unique because we have liquid water on the surface. We're also the only planet with active plate tectonics. 'Maybe this water in the mantle is key to plate tectonics, and that's part of what makes Earth habitable.'","Geologists estimate ancient rocks contain around 2.5 million cubic miles of water, more than all of the world's rivers, swamps and lakes put together .
Isotope testing has shown the water is up to 2.7 billion years old in places .

"The families of four men shot down by Cuban fighter jets in 1996 have condemned US President Barack Obama's decision to resume diplomatic relations with the Caribbean country. Marlene Alejandre Triana, whose father Armando Alejandre Jr was shot down by a Cuban MiG 29 fighter in 1996 as he was part of a flight of three aircraft involved in a humanitarian mission skirting the island's airspace. Mr Alejandre Jnr, a Vietnam war veteran, was part of a group of Cuban exiles called Brothers to the Rescue. The group of three aircraft were flying in the Florida Straits to propaganda leaflets. The men also dropped aid to refugees fleeing the communist island on flimsy rafts. Marlene Alejandre Triana's father Armando Alejandre Jr was shot down by Cuban MiGs in February 1996 . Gerardo Hernandez, pictured, was convicted in connection with the shooting down of the two aircraft . Mirta Costa, left, and Maggie Alejandre-Kuly, right, who lost a brother and a son in the attack both condemned the decision to release Gerardo Hernandez who was convicted in connection with shooting the aircraft . Armando Alejandre Jnr, right and Carlos Costa, right, were shot down on February 26, 1996 . Mario de la Pena, pictured,  was one of the pilots shot down by Cuban MiGs while on a humanitarian flight . Cuban authorities claimed that the aircraft on February 26, 1996 violated their airspace and two of them were shot down as a result, killing the four pilots, Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre Jnr Mario de la Pena and Pablo Morales. As part of a deal with Havana authorities, President Obama announced the release of the three remaining members of a group of spies called the Cuba Five. Among them was Gerardo Hernandez, who had been serving two life sentences plus 15 years on a murder conspiracy in connection with the 1996 shoot down. Ms Alejandre Triana said: 'My three daughters will never meet my father. For the only person that we had responsible for what happened to be let go, it's a slap in the face to my dad.' Mr Alejandre fled Cuba with his family as a child after Fidel Castro took power and volunteered to join the US Marines after turning 18, fighting in Vietnam. Maggie Alejandre-Khuly, Mr Alejandre's sister added: 'We simply cannot understand how this could have happened, especially in the case of Gerardo Hernandez. This was the only modicum of justice we had.' The Cuban Air Force sent a MiG 29, file picture, to intercept and shoot down the aircraft in February 1996 . US President Barack Obama, pictured, announced the major unexpected  thawing in relations with Cuba . Members of the Cuban Five met with Cuban President Raul Castro, centre, after the three remaining members of the group were released from prison in the US yesterday after serving up to 15 years in jail for spying . While exiles believe the Cuban Five are spies, the five men are described as heroes in Havana with massive billboards calling for their release. Cuban children are taught the five men's names. Cuba insisted the men were intelligence agents monitoring exile organisations in Florida. Rene Gonzalez, who was a dual US-Cuban national was the first of the five men freed in October 2011 after he completed 13 years in prison. He was deported and allowed to renounce his US citizenship. Fernando Gonzalez, who is not a relation to Rene Gonzalez, was released in February 2014 after serving more than 15 years in prison. However, many Cuban exiles were angered by President Obama's decision to deal with the Caribbean island . Thousands of Cubans took to the streets to welcome the historic announcement in Washington . President Obama's decision will see economic sanctions on Cuba lifted, allowing a trade agreement . The final three men, Gerardo Hernandez, Antonio Guerrero and Ramon Labanino were flown back to Cuba yesterday to a hero's welcome. The men appeared yesterday on Cuban state television with Raul Castro. In return, Cuba released American Alan Gross, who had been imprisoned for five years, and a Cuban who had spied for America. The announcement was welcomed in Cuba with the planned ending of the 53-year-old economic embargo. Milagros Diaz, 34, said: 'This opens a better future for us. We have really needed something like this because the situation has been bad and the people very discouraged. President Castro, wearing a military uniform addressed the nation claiming the two countries would work together 'without renouncing a single one of our principles.' Carlos Gonzalez, 32, who took to the streets in celebration said: 'For the Cuban people, I think this is like a shot of oxygen, a wish-come-true, because with this, we have overcome our differences. It is an advance that will open the road to a better future for the two countries.' Fidel and Raul Castro led the 1959 rebellion that toppled the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. The U.S. initially recognized the new government but broke relations in 1961 after Cuba veered sharply to the left and nationalised U.S.-owned businesses. The Cuban Five were placed on billboards and are regarded as heroes on the communist Caribbean island . Fernando Gonzalez, pictured, was released in February after serving more than 15 years in a US prison . Rene Gonzalez, pictured, was freed in October 2011 and renounced his US citizenship after returning to Cuba . Antonio Guerrero, left,  and Ramon Labanino, right, were also returned to Cuba as part of the deal . As Cuba turned toward the Soviet Union, the US imposed a trade embargo in 1962. Particularly since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Cubans have confronted severe shortages of oil, food and consumer goods, forcing them to ration everything from beans to powdered milk. The Cuban government blames most of its economic travails on the embargo, while Washington has traditionally blamed Cuba's Communist economic policies. In his address, Castro called on Washington to end its trade embargo which, he said, 'has caused enormous human and economic damage.' Ramon Roman, 62, said he hoped to see Cuba welcome more tourists. 'It would be a tremendous economic injection, both in terms of money and in new energy and would be a boost for average people who need it,' he said. Victoria Serrano, a lab worker, said she hoped to see an influx of new goods because life in Cuba has been 'really very difficult.' 'In particular,' she said, 'I hope we'll see an improvement in food - that there is trade in this with the United States, which is so close. Right now, even an onion has become a luxury.' Around the cathedral in Old Havana, people gathered in doorways and on sidewalks, gesturing excitedly as they discussed the news. Guillermo Delgado, a 72-year-old retiree, welcomed the announcement as 'a victory for Cuba because it was achieved without conceding basic principles.' Alan Gross, who was returned to the US as part of the deal spoke with President Obama on his way home . Yoani Sanchez, a renowned Cuban blogger critical of the government, noted the development came with a price. Castro, she said, could now claim a triumph and that he had made a 'bargaining chip' of Alan Gross, the US aid worker who was released from prison Wednesday while the US freed three Cubans held as spies. 'In this way, the Castro regime has managed to get its way,' she wrote in a blog post. 'It has managed to exchange a peaceful man, embarked on the humanitarian adventure of providing Internet connectivity to a group of Cubans, for intelligence agents that caused significant damage and sorrow with their actions.' Some dissidents expressed their displeasure at not being consulted by the US government about the historic move. Dissident Guillermo Farinas considered the move a 'betrayal' by President Obama who, he said, had promised that they would be consulted. Another activist, Antonio Rodiles, said the measure 'sends a bad message.' Others, meanwhile, were cautious, saying they'll wait and see what it all means. 'It's not enough since it doesn't lift the blockade,' said Pedro Duran, 28. 'We'll see if it's true, if it's not like everything here: one step forward and three steps back. For now, I don't think there will be any immediate improvement after we've been living like this for 50 years.' Opponents of President Barack Obama's sudden move to re-establish ties with Cuba have little chance of scuttling his effort in Congress. Members of the Cuban parliament, pictured, cried as they watched President Castro address the nation . His initiative faces some strong resistance among lawmakers and opened fissures in both parties. Criticism came mostly from Republicans, who say the new policy rewards Cuba's decades-long policies of repression, human rights abuses and aggression, but some prominent Democrats voiced opposition, too. Opponents spoke of holding up money to set up a full-service US embassy in Havana, blocking Obama's nominee as ambassador to Cuba or other such steps. But even if they were to pass sweeping legislation to stop what Obama wants to do, he could veto it and they are not likely to have the votes to override a veto. Even though Republicans will control both the Senate and House from January 6, they will face pressure from businesses and the farm industry - eyeing opportunities for commerce in Cuba - not to stand in the way of expanded ties. The Chamber of Commerce spent heavily in the midterm elections, investing $35 million to elect business-minded, predominantly Republican lawmakers. Its president, Thomas J. Donohue, said Wednesday that Obama's actions 'will go a long way in allowing opportunities for free enterprise to flourish.' Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, one of three lawmakers who flew to Cuba before dawn to escort Gross home, praised Obama's move. Leahy, the top Democrat on the committee that oversees foreign aid, said that over the years he's heard members of Congress tell presidents, 'Hang tough on Cuba and those Castros will be out of there any day now.' 'That was said to President Kennedy, President Johnson, President Nixon, President Ford, President Carter - you see what I'm driving at,' Leahy said. 'The fact is they are there. The fact is, Cuba is still there. 'Let's start finding out ways to at least work through our differences, embrace areas where we are alike.' Another Democrat, New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, voiced opposition to the new Cuban policy.","Marlene Alejandre Triana's father was shot down by Cubans in 1996 .

"Arrested: Margo Bronstein, 56, has been arrested on suspicion of killing three people and injuring nine others after ploughing into a crowd of churchgoers . Pedestrians were filing out of a church Christmas service when a car sped around other vehicles at a red light and plowed into the crowd before hitting another car head-on, police and witnesses said. Three people were killed, and several more were injured, California authorities said. 'Someone ran the red light, and bodies started flying. It was pretty horrible,' witness Marco Zonno told KNBC-TV. Within moments of the crash Wednesday night along California's famed Pacific Coast Highway, people were at the sides of victims lying in the street, said Mark Milutin, 26, who was in one of the cars stopped at the light. 'It was a very fast reaction,' he said. 'Two or three people were around each victim.' Margo Bronstein, 56, was arrested after the crash on suspicion of driving under the influence and vehicular manslaughter, Redondo Beach police Lt. Shawn Freeman said. Five children and eight adults, including the suspect and the other driver, suffered injuries including broken bones, abrasions and head trauma, Freeman said. Three people, Mary Anne Wilson, 81; Saeko Matsumura, 87; and Martha Gaza, 36, all of Torrance, later died, police said. At least two people remained in critical condition Thursday morning, Freeman said. Members of the crowd had just attended a Christmas program at St. James Catholic Church put on by students at the church's school. Casualty: A number of people are tended to at Redondo Beach in California, where a female driver ploughed into a crowd of people as they left a church's Christmas concert . Alan Wells, who lives in the apartment building at the corner, heard the crash and ran outside. 'I saw people lying all over the street, and people in the crosswalk were screaming and yelling,' he told the Daily Breeze. One boy who was struck was flung across the intersection, ending up beneath an SUV's tire, according to witnesses. 'The car is on the little boy. And we finally rolled it off the little boy. He had a little tie on. It was scary. It looked like he was in heaven at that point,' Michael Tovar told KTTV. The condition of the boy was unknown Thursday. St. James Msgr. Michael Meyers said church officials led prayers at the scene. The woman was driving a white sedan when she she ran a red light and ploughed into the group before colliding with another vehicle . Bronstein is being held on $300,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court on Friday. It wasn't immediately known if she has an attorney . One witness, Marco Zonno, told KNBC-TV: 'Someone ran the red light and bodies started flying. It was pretty horrible' The driver, Bronstein, had a perfect driving record but was restricted to driving a vehicle with hand-controlled brakes, an additional right-side mirror and adequate signaling device, according to DMV records . 'Nobody knew the condition of any of the victims so we simply went and prayed for each one and prayed over them and anointed them and just asked God's grace to be with them,' Meyers said. Bronstein was held on $300,000 bail and scheduled to appear in court on Friday. It wasn't immediately known if she has an attorney. Officials said they do not have information linking her to any prior arrests or DUI-related incidents. She had a perfect driving record but was restricted to driving a vehicle with hand-controlled brakes, an additional right-side mirror and adequate signaling device, according to Department of Motor Vehicle records. Scene: The tragic incident took place at the intersection between Pacific Coast Highway and Vincent Street . The DMV had no record listing her as handicapped, however. Milutin said the woman who hit the pedestrians, 'just looked completely out of it.' 'It was just a reaction I wouldn't have ever thought someone would have after a situation like that,' he said. A message seeking comment left at a phone number listed for Bronstein was not immediately returned Thursday. The crash comes three days after another driver now charged with drunken driving injured 11 people who were parked and looking at a holiday light display in the Los Angeles suburb of Alhambra.

"This is believed to be Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, the man imprisoned for almost 20 years by the Cuban Government . A former U.S. intelligence officer is claiming to have discovered the identity of the US spy freed by Cuba after nearly 20 years imprisonment. The Cuban national was released on Wednesday along with Alan Gross, the American subcontractor held for five years in Cuba. Today it was claimed that Rolando 'Roly' Sarraff Trujillo is the former cryptographer in Cuba's Directorate of Intelligence who worked secretly for the CIA. Arrested in 1995 and sentenced to 25 years in prison, he is thought to have had access to closely held intelligence at the highest levels of the Cuban government. Although U.S. officials refused to name him, a former Defense Intelligence Agency specialist on Cuba, Chris Simmons, told Newsweek he was '99.9 per cent sure' the mystery agent was Mr Sarraff Trujillo. He told the magazine: 'I know of all the Cubans on the list of people in jail and he is the only one who fits the description. 'I am 99.9 percent sure that Roly is the guy.' It's believed Mr Sarraff Trujillo's family have been informed he is no longer at the prison he was held in for the past year, but they are yet to receive any official confirmation he has been released. President Barack Obama said the spy was one of the most important intelligence agents America ever placed. 'This man - whose sacrifice has been known to only a few - provided America with the information that led us to arrest the network of Cuban agents that included the men transferred to Cuba today as well as other spies in the United States,' Obama said Wednesday. 'This man is now safely on our shores.' The spy swap announced by President Barack Obama (pictured) was key to the easing of diplomatic tensions which have been in force for half a century . Obama said the agent's 'sacrifice has been known to only a few,' and called him 'one of the most important intelligence agents that the United States has ever had in Cuba.' According to Brian Hale, spokesman for the director of national intelligence, the spy's information helped lead to the prosecution of Ana Belen Montes, a former senior Defense Intelligence Agency analyst who is serving a life sentence after spying for Cuba for 17 years; and former State Department official Walter Kendall Myers, serving life after spying for three decades. Montes, who was arrested in September 2001, is considered one of the most damaging spies in recent history, because she had access to - and betrayed - U.S. intelligence activities in Cuba. 'I think this is a tremendous gain for the intelligence community,' said Fran Townsend, a former senior national security official in the George W. Bush administration. 'This was a very productive asset who was well placed, trusted by the Cuban government and helped us in a number of ways.' She said it 'really is extraordinarily important to ongoing intelligence efforts when you are able to secure the release of an asset like this. 'It tells the world we remain loyal, we don't forget and we never abandon those who help us.' Alan Gross (pictured centre wearing a vest) arrives at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland with a group of US senators . President Obama and Alan Gross speak on the phone following Goss' release from a Cuban prison . The spy also helped the U.S. expose the 'Wasp Network,' in Florida, Hale said, a Cuban spy ring that included members of the Cuban Five, the last three of whom were released in exchange for the himself. Cuba also released 53 other prisoners. The Cuban Five were convicted in 2001 of being unregistered foreign agents, and three were also found guilty of espionage conspiracy for failed efforts to obtain military secrets from the U.S. Southern Command headquarters. 'In light of his sacrifice on behalf of the United States, securing his release from prison after 20 years - in a swap for three of the Cuban spies he helped put behind bars - is fitting closure to this Cold World chapter of U.S.-Cuban relations,' Hale said. Three of the Cuban Five - Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon Labanino and Antonio Guerrero - were sent home to Cuba as part of the swap. Hernandez had been convicted of murder conspiracy in the deaths of four Miami-based pilots whose small, private planes were shot down on Feb. 24, 1996, by a Cuban MiG in international waters off Cuba's northern coast. The 'Cuban Five' refers to intelligence agents whose so-called 'Wasp Network' operated in Florida in the 1990s. They were arrested in 1998 and later convicted on charges including conspiracy and failing to register as foreign agents. Cuba insists they were not acting against U.S. sovereignty, only keeping tabs on militant exile groups that Havana blames for terror attacks on the island, including a string of hotel bombings. However, prosecutors argued they also tried to penetrate military bases, including the U.S. Southern Command and facilities in the Florida Keys. Locals holding posters of the Cuban Five celebrate their release on the streets of Cuba . The three who remained imprisoned in the United States arrived to a heroes' welcome in Cuba on Wednesday. State TV broadcast images of them being embraced by President Raul Castro and having emotional reunions with family members, friends and neighbors. They were released in an exchange for a Cuban spy who had spent nearly 20 years in prison after working for the United States. For years, Havana has made them an official cause celebre, rivaling the case of Elian Gonzalez, the boy rafter who in 2000 was caught in a tug-of-war between his Cuban father and family in Miami. The 'Five Heroes,' as they are known in Cuba, are fixtures in state media and their faces grace billboards across the island. Schoolchildren are taught their names and take part in public acts demanding their release. However the five are reviled as spies by many exiles in South Florida. One, Gerardo Hernandez, had been serving two life sentences plus 15 years on a murder conspiracy conviction stemming from the Cuban air force's 1996 shoot-down of two planes flown by Brothers to the Rescue, an exile organization that sought to aid migrants at sea and also dropped propaganda leaflets. Cuban President Raul Castro (pictured third from right) poses with the reunited 'Cuban Five'. Pictured from left are Fernando Gonzalez, Ramon Labanino, Gerardo Hernandez, Antonio Guerrero and Rene Gonzalez . Hernandez was convicted of providing Cuban authorities with information about the flight, which he has always denied, maintaining it was public knowledge. Rene Gonzalez, a dual U.S.-Cuban national, became the first of the agents to walk free in October 2011 after completing about 13 years behind bars. He was initially ordered to serve three years of supervised parole and remain in the United States, but in 2013 a judge allowed him to return to Cuba and renounce his U.S. citizenship. Fernando Gonzalez, who is not related to Rene Gonzalez, was released in February 2014 after serving more than 15 years, and quickly deported to Cuba. The last three still in American lockups were Hernandez, Antonio Guerrero and Ramon Labanino.

"A machete, an axe and pill bottles were found near the body of Bradley Michael Stone, 35 . A machete, an axe and pill bottles were found near the body of an ex-military gunman who is believed to have killed six family members. Bradley Michael Stone, 35, was found dead in woods half a mile from his home in Pennsburg, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. Former Marines who served with Stone who is believed to have killed his ex-wife and five of her relatives said he fought constantly with her, although a Veterans Administration psychiatrist deemed him free of any suicidal or homicidal thoughts a week before the deadly rampage. The ax and the machete may have been used on some of his ex-wife's relatives, the youngest two of whom suffered what officials called 'chopping wounds.' The adults were shot. Stone and his ex-wife had been locked in a five-year custody battle that sparked frequent calls to the police. An autopsy Wednesday showed that Stone neither shot nor fatally stabbed himself, although he had some non-fatal cuts on his legs. Toxicology tests were being done to determine how he died. Sources told ABC that Stone was found on his knees wearing camouflage clothing. Fellow veterans Adam Perone and Robert Groover said they served with Stone in Pennsylvania, trained with him in California and deployed to Iraq with him in 2008. They said Stone complained frequently about his then-wife, Nicole Stone, and often fought with her on the phone. Perone said he does not want people to assume Stone's experience in the service sparked the Monday morning rampage. 'These veterans come back, 99.9 percent of them are doing the right thing. 'They're changing their lives for the better,' said Perone, now a sales manager at an international trading firm in Somerset, New Jersey. 'Something like this takes away from those people.'

Stone and his ex-wife had been locked in a five-year custody battle that sparked frequent calls to the police . Stone's violent rampage across three towns in Montgomery County happened before dawn Monday. A week earlier, he had lost an emergency petition to amend a shared custody agreement. The Department of Veterans Affairs said Stone had post-traumatic stress disorder and received full service-related disability of about $3,260 a month. However, the VA said, he didn't have any suicidal or homicidal thoughts when he was evaluated by a psychiatrist on December 8, a day before the custody ruling.

Stone, 35, spared his two young daughters in the attack, but authorities said he broke into three homes early Monday and killed his ex-wife, her mother, her grandmother, her sister, her brother-in-law and her 14-year-old niece .

Stone, 35, spared his two young daughters in the attack, but authorities said he broke into three homes early Monday and killed his ex-wife, her mother, her grandmother, her sister, her brother-in-law and her 14-year-old niece. A 17-year-old nephew survived by barricading himself in the third floor of his home, but not before he suffered a skull fracture, lacerations and several severed fingertips. A 17-year-old nephew, Anthony, was left clinging to life in hospital after suffering a gunshot wound to the head, being stabbed and losing three fingers . Nephew Anthony Flick was in the house injured for more than seven hours Monday because police thought the person they had briefly seen in the upstairs window before he retreated was the gunman — especially after SWAT teams entered the home and found three bodies on the lower floors, Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman said. Stone had broken into the home at about 4 a.m., police said. A Philadelphia hospital declined to release updates on the teenage nephew's condition Wednesday. Stone's other victims ranged in age from 14 to 75. Groover, now a social worker in Pittsburgh, said he served with Stone in Ramadi. He said the job mainly involved watching a computer monitor to track missiles during four-hour shifts. He did not consider the assignment stressful, and he said the base was safe enough to go running. He said the base took a few hits from missiles but those were after Stone had returned to the U.S. Stone's body was found Tuesday afternoon a half-mile from his home in Pennsburg, 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia, ending a day-and-a-half manhunt. Montgomery County Coroner Walter Hofman said he hopes to get toxicology tests back early next week. One of the pill bottles contained crushed powder, Ferman said. Stone and his ex-wife had been fighting over their children's custody since she filed for divorce in 2009. Stone may have visited with his daughters as recently as Saturday.

"A boom in player recruitment for Major League Baseball is being mooted in the wake of yesterday's surprise thawing of relations between Cuba and the U.S. A day after President Barack Obama announced the two nations will re-engage after more than half a century of hostilities, baseball experts have turned their gaze towards Cuba for the next generation of high quality talent. That talent has faced obstacles getting to the U.S. since 1961, when the United States terminated diplomatic relations with Cuba. Cuban Los Angeles Dodgers player Yasiel Puig makes a run from first base during a baseball game in July. He is one of 25 Cuban-born players currently playing in the major leagues . Boston Red Sox's Yoenis Cespedes, a Cuban, hits a ball during a baseball game at Yankee Stadium in September . Baseball is an immensely popular sport in Cuba and the country has a strong domestic competition. Pictured is the Cuban national team following an exhibition series against the Baltimore Orioles . Fred Claire, a former Los Angeles Dodger general manager, said establishing academies in Cuba was an 'absolutely natural (progression), just as the Dominican was and Venezuela'. He added: 'You go to where the talent is. The high level talent for Cuban players is still there.' The path to the major leagues for Cuban players has often involved smugglers who bring them out of the island nation for a price. However, it's hard to foresee exactly how that will change in the short-term, or whether MLB teams will be allowed to invest resources in the communist country. 'While there are not sufficient details to make a realistic evaluation, we will continue to track this significant issue, and we will keep our clubs informed if this different direction may impact the manner in which they conduct business on issues related to Cuba,' MLB said in a statement.

Twenty-five Cuban-born players appeared in the major leagues this year, a group that includes outfielders Yasiel Puig and Yoenis Cespedes, and hard-throwing reliever Aroldis Chapman. There have been 59 since 1995. Many have received large contracts, topped by a $72.5 million, seven-year agreement in August between outfielder Rusney Castillo and the Boston Red Sox. Chicago White Sox first baseman Jose Abreu was voted AL Rookie of the Year this season after agreeing to a $68 million, six-year deal with the Chicago White Sox. Yasmany Tomas, an outfielder who may be shifted to third base, signed $68.5 million, six-year contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks this month. Because of the American trade embargo, a player who defects from Cuba has to obtain a license from the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control to 'unblock' him before he can sign with a major league organization. It would take congressional action to lift the embargo. 'We remain hopeful that today's announcement will lead to further positive developments,' the Major League Baseball Players Association said in a statement. The Cuban government has approved a policy allowing athletes to sign in foreign leagues and pay tax on their earnings, but the U.S. embargo prevents American teams from employing Cuban residents. Well regarded outfielder Alfredo Despaigne agreed this year to a contract with the Chiba Lotte Marines of Japan's Pacific League.

Fans of the Cuban national team cheer on their players during its game against the Baltimore Orioles in Havana . Defecting players have established residency outside the U.S. in order to become free agents and not be subject to MLB's amateur draft. But free-agent riches could come to an end in 2017, when MLB teams hope to start an international draft. 'Frankly, American players, many of them have a lesser standard than what's offered international players,' said agent Scott Boras, who has criticized restraints on contracts for players in American high schools and colleges. 'We've really got to review what we're doing with our draft and our international players to really say what we do with the Cubans. Maybe it will prompt a broader discussion to revamp the entirety of the system.'","Experts are expecting huge investment in Cuban players by MLB clubs .

Grant Lavery from RM Smith Fencing Ltd said: 'I was just putting up the fence when I felt something hit me on the leg and I saw the pellet bounce off.

"James Bond author Ian Fleming was invited to dinner by John F Kennedy on March 13, 1960, when he was preparing a run for the White House. Kennedy asked the former British spy, who devised a number of plots during World War II, what the United States should do to deal with the worsening situation in Cuba. Fleming, it is claimed, told Kennedy, that killing Fidel Castro was not simply enough, he had to be thoroughly humiliated. James Bond author Ian Fleming, left, had dinner with John F Kennedy, right, in March 1960 where the politician asked the former spy for his ideas on the best way with dealing with Cuban leader Fidel Castro . The CIA considered a range of methods of dealing with Fidel Castro, pictured, including poisoning his cigars . According to Christopher Moran in the Journal of Cold War Studies: 'Fleming suggested flooding the streets of Havana with pamphlets explaining that radioactive fallout from nuclear testing caused impotence and was known to be drawn to men who had beards. 'As a result, Cuban men would shave off their facial hair, thus severing a symbolic link to Castro and the revolution. If this did not work, the CIA should build a religious manifestation, ideally a cross of sorts, and fly it over the Havana skyline in order to induce the Cubans to look skyward.' Between 1960 and 1965 the CIA considered at least eight plots to assassinate Castro. On July 25, 1962, a Top Secret document was prepared for the White House outlining Operation Mongoose, which considered the overthrow of Castro. According to the document: 'As desired by higher authority [President Kennedy] on November 30, 1961, the US undertook a special effort ""in order to help Cuba overthrow the Communist regime"".' Fleming was a close friend of CIA director Allen Dulles, pictured, who quizzed the Bond author about spycraft . The CIA considered tampering with Fidel Castro's cigar, either poisoning it or turning it into an explosive . Dulles was fascinated by Charles Fraser-Smith, who was the inspiration for Q in the Bond books, and was a technical expert for the Special Operations Executive during the second world war designing gadgets . Operation Mongoose involved the 'acquisition of hard intelligence of the target area. 'Undertaking all other political, economic and covert actions, short of inspiring a revolt in Cuba or developing the need for US armed intervention. 'Be consistent with US overt policy, and remain in position to disengage with minimum of loss in assets and US prestige. 'Continue JCS [Joint Chiefs of Staff] planning and essential preliminary actions for a decisive US capability for intervention.' Fleming was a close friend of the first civilian director of the CIA Allen Dulles, who was due to also attend the dinner with Kennedy. Dulles called Fleming several days after the March 1960 dinner to speak about his ideas. Dulles and Fleming first met in London in 1959 when the spy-turned-author told the CIA director that 'Q' in his books was based on Charles Fraser-Smith, who produced gadgets for the Special Operations Executive during the Second World War. Dulles later wrote that he had tasked the CIA to develop a homing beacon used to track a car in Fleming's Bond book Goldfinger, released in 1959. He said: 'I put my people in CIA to work on this as a serious project, but they came up with an answer that it had too many bugs in it. The device really didn't work very well with the enemy got into a crowded city.' John F Kennedy wanted to meet with Ian Fleming because he was so impressed with his Bond creation . Robert Wallace, retired director of the CIA's technical service said: 'When a new Bond movie was released, we always got calls asking, ""Do you have one of those?"" If I answered ""no"", the next question was, ""How long will it take you to make it?"" Folks didn't care about the laws of physics or that Q was an action in a fictional series - his character and inventiveness pushed or imagination.' During the early to mid 1960s, the CIA considered at least eight plots to assassinate Castro as part of Operation Mongoose. Brigadier-General Edward Lansdale oversaw plans which considered placing Tallium salt in his shoes which would cause Castro's beard to fall out. Another possible way of killing Castro involved his cigars, with one plan to hide an explosive in the tobacco or another to lace it with poison. Other agents studied the possibility of killing Castro while he was diving. Plans were discussed which considered infecting his air supply with a biological agent. But Desmond Fitzgerald, the CIA's former head of Cuban operations said he bought two books on Caribbean mollusks, to find a seashell suitable to hold an explosive device, which would kill the communist leader on the sea bed. Another plan, which seemed similar to one discussed at the Kennedy dinner table involved a CIA campaign describing Castro as the anti-Christ, while a US submarine would light up the sky with starbursts announcing the Second Coming. According to the Journal of Cold War Studies, the Russian newspaper Izvestiya remarked on the relationship between the CIA head and the James Bond author. In an editorial written in April 1962, the newspaper claimed: 'Fleming prides himself on his knowledge of espionage and villainy. His best friend is Allen Dulles... who even attempted (but unsuccessfully) to try methods recommended by Fleming in his books. Obviously American propagandists must be in a bad way if they have recourse to the help of an English retired spy turned mediocre writer.' The Top Secret Operation Mongoose was overseen by Brigadier General Edward Lansdale in 1962 .","Bond author Ian Fleming met John F Kennedy for dinner in March 1960 .

"Vladimir Putin has denied that the Russian economic collapse is punishment for annexing Crimea earlier this year and has vowed to fix the problem in two years at the most. Delivering his end-of-year speech in Moscow today, a bullish Putin said Russia is becoming 'more and more determined' to protects its interest, and accused the West of trying to put Russia 'in chains'. He also accepted full responsibility for the country's economic problems, saying he does not shy away from them, instead stating that Russia will recover stronger than ever. Scroll down for video . Vladimir Putin gave an aggressive speech today in which he said the West was trying to put Russia 'in chains', while warning that his is 'more and more determined' to defend the country's interests . Putin used the speech to take a swipe at the West during his end-of-year speech in Moscow today, saying leasers want to put the Russian bear 'in chains' and 'remove its fangs and its claws' Putin also tried to restore calm to the economy the falling price of oil and gas, along with Western sanctions and investor panic, lead to a currency meltdown two days ago . The Russian leader, who has been on the back foot this week after the tumbling value of Russia's currency caused widespread panic, sought to reassure investors with a blistering speech today. While the televised address was not short on passion it was short on substance, as the country's currency took another dip in value after two straight days of losses. He accepted that EU and U.S. sanctions over Crimea were 25 to 30 per cent to blame for the country's economic woes, but said the West did not care about Ukraine and was only using the conflict as an excuse to punish him. During the three hour address Putin launched a scathing attack on Western leaders, saying they were trying to remove Russia's 'fangs and claws'. He said: 'Sometimes I think, maybe they'll let the bear eat berries and honey in the forest, maybe they will leave it in peace. 'They will not. Because they will always try to put him on a chain, and as soon as they succeed in doing so they tear out his fangs and his claws. 'Once they've taken out his claws and his fangs, then the bear is no longer necessary. He'll become a stuffed animal. A defiant Putin hit back today, saying sanctions were only 25 to 30 per cent to blame for the crash, and adding that it will take two years to fix the issue 'at most' Speaking in Moscow Putin also hit out at Western leaders, saying they did not care about Ukraine, but had used the situation there as a way to punish Russia . Speaking with real emotion Putin said that the West sought to put the Russian bear 'in a chain' in order to 'rip out its fangs and claws' - referring to the country's nuclear weapons . 'The issue is not Crimea, the issue is that we are protecting our sovereignty and our right to exist.' He blamed the current Eastern European crisis on President Yanukovich, the former Ukrainian Prime Minister who was forced to flee the country, saying he was reluctant to use force. Speaking against the backdrop of videos showing him meeting cosmonauts, Sochi athletes, and petting a baby tiger, he denied that Russia had invaded, saying he has not invaded anyone. He added: 'Whatever Russia does, it is always met with criticism.' Outside the venue a group of activists gathered, lead by journalist Yevgeny Levkovich, and tried to break in to ask Putin 'some awkward questions.' Around 20 were taken away by police, while inside Putin continued undisturbed, accused the West of bullying Russia by denying its artists the chance to perform in Western cities. He claimed that this was unfair, because 'nobody inside Russia is being bullied for supporting Ukraine.' Despite his aggressive tone he repeated his claims that Russia is looking for a peaceful solution in Ukraine, saying it should remain one state, but must respect all its regions if it is to have peace. Meanwhile outside the TV studios police haul away a protester who was planning on heckling at the event . The Russian rouble lost 20 per cent of its value on Tuesday, slipping to an historic low of 80 to one dollar, causing Apple to suspend online sales and panic buying in the shops . He also said the government in Kiev of building 'a wall' against the country's east, saying it was harming relations there. The Russian President, who is facing the largest crisis of his leadership after the rouble lost almost 20 per cent of its value on Tuesday, said the collapse could be over sooner if external factors improve. Putin said: 'Our economy will overcome the current situation. How much time will be needed for that? Under the most unfavorable circumstances I think it will take about two years.' EU leaders have urged Putin to make a 'radical change' over Ukraine today as they plotted a 'tough and responsible' policy on Russia this evening. European Council president Donald Tusk said: 'We should send a strong signal on our readiness to further support Ukraine, also financially, as we have done politically today by making the existing sanctions on Crimea and Sebastopol more effective.' Earlier in the day officials banned investment in Crimea and said cruise ships will not stop at its ports as part of the latest round of sanctions against Russia's 'illegal annexation'. Under the new restrictions, European Union companies will not be allowed to buy real estate in Crimea, finance local companies or supply related services. Tourism services are also banned, with cruise ships barred from Crimea ports, except in an emergency. Russia annexed Crimea earlier this year after holding a referendum which was widely seen as corrupt after weeks of unrest. It has been a tough 48 hours for Putin, after moves by the Russian Central Bank to shore up the country's economy caused panic among investors, leading to the currency losing 20 per cent of its value two days ago. Since then Apple has suspended online sales in Russia, saying it cannot set prices while the currency is so volatile, while Ikea and other large stores warned of large price rises, causing panic buying. At one point on Tuesday the rouble hit an all-time low of 80 to the dollar, and while the currency has since climbed back to 61, it is still below the historic low of 60. Putin praised the Russian Central Bank for its work in managing the market, although he said some of their decisions were made too late. The bank's decision to raise interest rates from 10.5 per cent to 17 per cent on Tuesday helped to spark the panic. He added that more needs to be done to diversify Russia's economy, which is largely reliant on oil and gas. Looking to the future he added that Russia will spare 'no expense' when it comes to putting on the 2018 World Cup. Speaking in Moscow, Putin said the nation's currency reserves are sufficient to keep the economy stable, saying Russia shouldn't aimlessly 'burn' its reserves, currently standing at $419 billion. The government also needs to work with exporters to encourage them not to stash their hard currency earnings, to help the ruble stabilise, he said. Among the less conventional moves Putin is using to bring stability to the economy is to release tycoons such as Vladimir Yevtushenkov from prison. Mr Yevtushenkov arrest in September for money laundering spooked markets, causing a brief tumble, and his release today sent shares in his company Sistema surging by 30 per cent. Putin admitted some decision by the Russian Central Bank were made too late. The move to hike interest rates two days ago sparked the current crisis after it caused investors to panic .","Bullish Putin uses annual speech to attack the West and its leaders .

"His story divided the nation - and led to him making an appearing on Newsnight to defend his actions. Now former Great British Bake Off contestant Iain Watters is making it his mission to ensure Christmas puddings don't end up in the same place as his Baked Alaska - the bin. The 31-year-old lost his place in the BBC baking competition in August when, in a rage, he threw away his ice-cream dessert after it was controversially taken out of the freezer by fellow contestant Diana Beard. This years' alternative to Christmas pudding: Belfast baker Iain Watter's chocolate chestnut orange cake . Now, working together with ao.com, the bearded Belfast baker has released a recipe video of this year's alternative to Christmas pudding: a chocolate chestnut orange Christmas cake. 'If the Christmas pudding at your table isn't going to go down too well with guests, there really is very little point in making one at all,' Mr Watters says in the footage. 'There are plenty of other homemade dessert options that would work wonderfully with a Christmas dinner.' The 31-year-old worked with shopping website ao.com to release his recipe video . The recipe - in full below - was created after the shopping website's research revealed a quarter of Britons loathe Christmas pudding. The traditional festive staple was ranked fourth in the food most likely to end in the bin after Christmas dinner - and one in five will only eat if it its smothered in brandy sauce or cream. Although 12 per cent of Britons will be baking their own pud this year, more than a quarter will be looking for an alternative, less traditional dessert to the Christmas pudding. Ingredients . 125g soft, stoned prunes . 75g butter . 125g dark chocolate – around 60% cocoa . 200g puree chestnuts . 100ml double cream . Juice and zest of 1 orange . 3 large eggs, separated . 125g caster sugar . For the Chocolate cake . 3 large eggs . 250g butter . 250g caster sugar . 250g plain flour . 40g cocoa powder . 2 ½ tsp baking powder . Juice and zest of 1 orange . For the Chocolate water ganache . 250g chocolate 60% . 125ml boiling water . For the Italian Meringue . 2 egg whites . ¼ tsp cream of tartar . 110g caster sugar . 50ml water . For the Decoration . Cocoa for dusting . Candied chestnuts . Flaked almonds . Method . For the torte: Prepare a 20cm springform tin with non-sticking baking paper and preheat the oven to 170c. Firstly very finely chop and mash the prunes in a food processor and set aside. In a bain-marie or double boiler, melt the chocolate and butter together. While the chocolate is melting, whisk the chestnut puree and double cream together until you have smooth texture and set aside. Next, separate the eggs, cream the caster sugar and egg yolks until they become thick and glossy. Now, whisk the whites into soft peaks and set aside. You should now have five different bowls of ingredients: mix together the eggs and sugar with the chestnut puree, followed by the prunes and then the chocolate mixture. Lightly whisk until well combined. Finely grate the zest of the orange into the mixture followed by the juice. To combine the egg whites, first put one big dollop of the whites into the mixture to loosen it. Then gently fold in in the remaining whites until they are all combined. Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 25 to 30 mins. It should be still slight wobbly in the middle and a few cracks will have appeared. Allow to cool and removed the springform tin and chill for a few hours in the fridge. For the chocolate cake:  Prepare two 20 cm springform or normal tins with non-stick baking paper.Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy with a hand mixer. Next sieve the flour, cocoa powder and baking powder into a separate bowl. add all the eggs into the sugar mixture along with the sieved dry ingredients and beat together until well combined. Finely grate the zest of the orange into the mixture followed by the juice and mix in. Divide the mixture evenly between the two tins and bake at 170 for 20 mins. Remove the oven and cool on a wire rack. Once the cakes are half cooled and the torte has chilled, its time to stack them. First place one sponge on top of the torte and flip it over so the sponge is now on the bottom. The torte is quite delicate so this means there is less chance of it breaking up. Now place the second sponge on top of the torte. The torte should now be in the filling of a sponge sandwich. For the ganache: The ganache is made with water and chocolate not cream. In a bain-marie or double boiler melt the chocolate. While the chocolate is melting boil 125ml of water. Once melted take the bowl off the heat and pour in about a table spoon of the water in the chocolate, and whisk together. It will look like its separating but keep whisking – it will come together. Then add the remaining water and keep whisking. The ganache will be a bit runny but will thicken up as it cools. While the ganache is still workable, cover the whole cake/torte in the ganache with a palette knife. For the meringue: In a saucepan, stir the sugar and water together over a medium heat. Dip a pastry brush in water and brush any bits of sugar from the sides of the pan down into the syrup to melt, otherwise it will turn the sugar syrup grainy. When all of the sugar is dissolved, bring it to a fast boil until it reaches 120C/250F. While the syrup is reaching temperature, whisk the egg whites with the cream of tartar into soft peaks. As soon as the syrup reaches the correct temperature, pour it onto the egg whites in a thin, steady stream as you whisk. Be careful not to pour the hot syrup directly onto the beaters, as it may stick to them or splash back at you. When all the syrup has been mixed, continue to whisk the meringue until it has cooled. It should be shiny and stiff and be tepid temperate. Transfer to a piping bag and with a large nozzle pipe small peaks to the top of the cake, starting around the outside and work your way into the middle. Dust your serving plate with cocoa and transfer the cake to the plate, finish the top of the cake with finely chopped candied chestnuts and flaked almonds. The cake will keep for three days in the fridge so can be made in advance.","Quarter of Britons hate traditional Christmas pudding research reveals .

"Eleven people have been killed in an assault on a police station in China's northwestern region of Xinjiang, it emerged today. It is the latest in a series of attacks pointing to growing unrest among the region's native Turkic Muslim Uighur ethnic group over social and religious discrimination in the area. Two police officers and nine militants were killed in the incident on Saturday afternoon, the Xinjiang regional government said in a statement posted on its microblog. It said the assailants were armed with knives and axes in the attack in Bachu county's Serikbuya township, near the historic city of Kashgar. Unrest: Eleven people have been killed in a clash between police and militants in the Xinjiang region, pictured . 'Nine mobs [sic] holding knives and axes attacked a police station at Bachu county, killing two auxiliary policemen and injuring another two policemen,' according to a report on xinhuanet.com, which cited a web report from the Xinjiang government. 'The nine mobs were gunned down on the site and local social orders restored to normal,' said the report, which identified one of the attackers with an apparent Uighur name. The statement added that two police officers were injured in the clash. Calls to government and police offices in the region rang unanswered Sunday. The U.S.-government funded broadcaster Radio Free Asia and a Uighur (pronounced WEE'-gur) activist claimed that several of the young attackers were killed by a police special weapons and tactics team. Local residents had apparently gathered at the scene to urge the officers to take the attackers alive. 'There were around 40 to 50 people gathered around the station. They shouted to the police not to shoot, capture them alive and try them,' the broadcaster quoted an unnamed eyewitness as saying. Sweden-based activist Dilxat Raxit said security forces have been increasingly opting to shoot and kill suspects at the scene rather than capturing them and putting them on trial. 'Before, they'd put them on trial. You could argue about the fairness of the trial, but at least they were alive. Now, they're just killing them outright,' Raxit said by phone. He said the tougher policy appeared to be aimed at intimidating Uighurs and preventing suspects from giving testimony. Accusations: Radicals among the region's native Turkic Muslim Uighur ethnic group, pictured in Hotan, farwest China's Xinjiang region, have been blamed for the attack by officials . 'Now all of Bachu county is under lockdown, and any incident is suppressed by force,' Raxit said. Xinjiang has long been home to a simmering insurgency against Chinese rule led by radicals among the region's native Uighur ethnic group. This year has seen increasing bloodshed, with a number of deadly clashes in Xinjiang and one in the heart of Beijing in which three attackers drove a vehicle through crowds in front of historic Tiananmen Gate, killing themselves and two tourists. Scores of attackers and government officials have been killed, although the total figure isn't known because many incidents go unreported. The authorities blame the violence on Uighur terrorists allied with al-Qaida. Activists say despair over economic and social discrimination as well as cultural and religious restrictions are fueling anger among Uighurs. The government statement gave few details, but the official China Daily newspaper said the nine attackers were shot dead on the spot, and identified one of them by the Uighur name of Abula Ahat. The newspaper said the police station was the same one that had been attacked in April in a clash that erupted after local police and community workers discovered suspicious behavior at a nearby home. That led to a gang of alleged extremists hacking and burning to death 15 members of the security services, while six of their own were shot dead. Xinjiang is a sprawling region bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan and a number of unstable Central Asian states. It is home to about 9ninemillion Uighurs, many of whom complain that they've been marginalized by policies favoring Han migrants. Beijing says it treats all minorities fairly and spends billions of dollars on development and improving living standards in Xinjiang.

"Controversial televangelist Pat Robertson has caused outrage after telling viewers of his popular talk show that 'homosexuals will die out' - because they can't reproduce. The former Southern Baptist minister made the comments on The 700 Club, a daily talk show on the Christian Broadcast Network (CBN). Robertson, who founded CBN, apparently has not considered the options now available to same sex couples should they want to have a baby - nor the fact it is just as likely a straight couple will produce a gay child. Scroll down for video . Pat Robertson believes gay people will die out because they cannot reproduce . A video shows the 84-year-old dishing out advice to Crystal, who wrote in worried her church's ban on relationships between the opposite sex was going to leave her and her friends alone. 'I've been in a church all my life but we are not allowed to date,' she wrote. 'The only ones in my church that are married knew their partners before coming in to church. It is treated as a sin to show interest or to have a mutual understanding in church with the opposite sex.' But Robertson doesn't answer her question directly, instead apparently likening her church's practices to those of 'homosexuals'. 'I know those who are homosexuals will die out, because they do not reproduce. You have to have the heterosexual sex to reproduce,' he says in the video, posted by Right Wing Watch. 'Same thing with this church: it is doomed, it is going to die out. Because it's the most nonsensical thing I have heard in a long time. This is absurd.' He continued: 'God has made us to be in families. God has created a desire of men and women to have attraction to the opposite sex so that they will reproduce and have children. 'If I were you, I'd get out of the church as fast as I could, cast the dust of it on your feet, shake off the dust and run.' His comments have created anger - and hilarity - on Twitter. Osbeacher (@osbeacher) called him 'one of the stupidest men alive', . Benji W ‏(@benjiw) wrote: 'Pat Robertson is just angry that gays are so fabulous it takes two straight people to make one gay person. I predict he'll die out too.' Ziggy Daddy noted 'Pat Roberston failed biology 101', while Reggie Hammond (‏@allonb) pointed out: 'If it hasn't happened in 6000 years it ain't gonna happen.' This isn't the first time Robertson's comments have caused eyebrows to raise. In January 2013, he told the wife of a cheating husband to get over her man’s infidelity and start doing more to ensure he doesn’t have reason to wander. In August of that year he was back in the headlines, this time claiming gay men are knowingly spreading the HIV virus while shaking hands with others using a special ring. He later clarified the comment, saying he only was only talking about gays from ‘years ago,’, not gays today. Since establishing the Christian Broadcasting Network in 1960, Pat Robertson has been no stranger to controversy.","Robertson made the comment on his daily talk show The 700 Club .

"Passengers aboard American Airlines Flight 280 from South Korea to Dallas screamed in terror as their Boeing jet shook violently and dipped after hitting bad turbulence Tuesday. New video recorded in the first class section of the plane and another shot in coach show the panic and chaos among the passengers, some of whom turned to prayer as their jet jerked from side to side, scattering food and plates everywhere. Marc Stanley, a prominent Dallas attorney with ties to President Obama, was sitting in the premium part of the plane when it encountered rough conditions. Scroll down for videos . Terror in the sky: Marc Stanley, a prominent Dallas attorney with ties to President Obama, recorded a video showing passengers in first class experiencing rough turbulence . Hurt: Photos show several passengers hurt, among them this woman who appears to be wearing a neck brace . In all, five passengers required hospitalization in the aftermath of the incident . View inside coach: Coach passenger John Mitchell recording a video showing the plane shaking from side to side and people screaming and gasping in terror . He turned on his cellphone camera and started taking still photos and recording video showing food and trash scattered in the aisle and splotches of wine on the overhead bins. One of the images shows a woman wearing what appears to be a neck brace, while in another a man receives medical treatment. Some passengers could be heard praying or leaving voicemail messages for their loved ones. Stanley, a fundraiser for Obama and a married father of three, called the experience the worst flight of his life in an interview with CBS DFW. Flight 280, a Boeing 777-200 heading from Incheon, South Korea, to Dallas/Forth Worth airport, was flying over Japan when the plane dropped suddenly and was rocked intensely for 30 to 40 seconds. Following the incident, the jet was forced to make an emergency landing in Tokyo. The attorney recalled that at one point, it felt as if the jet carrying 240 passengers and 15 crew dropped out of the sky. A traveler named John Mitchell also made a recording on his phone showing the moment the Boeing took a major dip, sparking panic inside the cabin. People in coach are heard in the video gasping and screaming in terror as the plane rattles from side to side before taking a sudden dive. Up in the air: Dallas attorney and Obama donor Marc Stanley took these photos showing food and trash scattered in the aisle of American Airlines Flight 280 that hit severe turbulence .

This photo shows Obama whispering something in his ear in 2009 . Four passengers and an airline employee were hospitalized with non life-threatening injuries. Stanley, a former Chairman of the National Jewish Democratic Council, wrote on his Facebook page that the plane was diverted to Narita International Airport in Tokyo 'due to significant passenger and crew injuries and alleged damage to the plane' caused by 'insane turbulence.' 'One flight attendant took out an exit sign. High marks to crew. Low marks to AA weather folks,' Stanley wrote on his page. Funnyman: Stanley and his wife (left) posed for a picture with comedian and late-night host Conan O'Brien when he traveled to Dallas earlier this year for a live taping of his show . Reaching across the aisle: Stanley, a staunch Democrat, raised a few eyebrows among his friends by taking a picture with former Republican House Speaker and presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich . The status update was accompanied by photos taken by the Obama fundraiser showing splotches of wine on overhead bins, food and soda cans scattered down the aisle and a beverage cart resting on its side. Stanley, who is married and has three grown children, was appointed by President Obama in 2011 to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Council. In early July, Stanley threw a late-afternoon, $10,000-a-plate fundraiser dinner at his home, with proceeds going to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Besides the president, the barbecue was also attended by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. On Tuesday, Marc Stanley and his fellow passengers were settling into their 12-hour transpacific journey from Seoul to Dallas when the plane hit turbulent skies east of Japan, sending glass 'flying' inside the aircraft cabin, according to a woman on board. 'We were eating and all the food just flew up in the air and pretty much bounced off and fell. There were carts all over the place,' one passenger told TV Tokyo when the aircraft landed shortly after midnight at Tokyo's Narita airport. Japanese national broadcaster NHK said one person suffered a broken bone. The passengers and crew from the flight were given hotel rooms for the night, and the flight will continue to the United States on Wednesday.

The Weather Channel said the plane encountered turbulence while flying through a ‘rapidly intensifying winter storm’ that is expected to become a ‘weather bomb.' The network said the storm is associated with a powerful ribbon of 150-200mph winds in the jet stream, approximately 38,000ft above sea level. The storm has prompted blizzard warnings for northern and western Japan, and high wind warnings for coastal areas near Tokyo. According to flight radar data, the plane was east of Japan when it turned south and then west as it diverted to one of the world’s five busiest airports. It was scheduled to land at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport at 3pm local time on Wednesday.","Dallas lawyer and Obama donor Marc Stanley was flying home from South Korea Tuesday .

"Passengers on a flight from London to the US watched as the aircraft dumped fuel over the English Channel as they spent  four hours circling above the Isle of Wight. More than 200 passengers and 13 crew were on board United Airlines flight UA28, which took off from Heathrow at 11am yesterday on its way to Newark airport New York. But the Boeing 767-400 developed a 'maintenance issue' soon after take-off and the pilot started circling over southern England before landing back at Heathrow shortly before 4pm. Scroll down for video . Photos taken by passengers on UA28 show fuel being dumped from the wing as the aircraft circled . Manchester's Marcus Mollinga, 20, was on board the plane with his girlfriend Abby Stokes and told how passengers endured hours of flying in a circle in bad turbulence. He told MailOnline: 'It took off okay but about an hour and a half in we were told we were flying back to Heathrow. 'The pilot said he had to dump about 20,000 lbs of fuel and the cabin pressure was low so we had to fly at low altitude. 'It was a bit scary, as we were just circling for hours and because of the low altitude we were flying through cloud most of the time, so there was a lot of turbulence. 'United Airlines didn't handle it very well, they kept telling us it would be one more hour, then one more and it just went on. 'Some Americans were kicking off about it and some one claimed the plane would ""blow up"" if we tried to fly to the US.'

"The Pope 'played a very important role' in opening up a dialogue between the United States and Cuba, says President Barack Obama. 'The Pope doesn't wield armies. He can't impose sanctions, but he can speak with great moral authority, and that makes a difference,' the U.S. president said in an interview that aired today on Good Morning America. 'And it certainly made a difference in this case,' he added. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis and President Barack Obama shake hands during a private audience on March 27, 2014 at the Vatican.  The meeting preceded talks between U.S. and Cuban officials in October at the Vatican that led to an announcement on Wednesday that the countries had reestablished diplomatic relations . Obama, consciously or not, channeled a famous Stalin statement about the power of the Pope. Soviet Dictator Joseph Stalin is said to have written off the importance of the Pope in a conversation with French Prime Minister Pierre Laval and British Prime Minister Winston ChurchilI. In his book The Second World War, Churchill writes that in 1935 Stalin told Laval flippantly, 'The Pope! How many divisions has he got?' While the Pope was not directly involved in the talks between the U.S. and Cuba, according to the White House, the Vatican played host to at least one discussion between 'high-level administration officials' from both countries 'in a meeting that was hosted by members of the Pope’s team.' 'We certainly welcomed their participation in these conversations, and the degree to which the Pope and his team facilitated this reconciliation is one that we appreciate,' Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday. The White House also credited the Pope with helping to jump start talks in the first place through personal letters he wrote to both Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. According to the Vatican, the letters encouraged the two country's leaders to 'resolve humanitarian questions of common interest, including the situation of certain prisoners.' The Holy See also confirmed in a statement that the Vatican served as a meeting place for officials from Cuba and the United States in October. Obama was not present at those discussions but he did travel to the Vatican to visit the head of the Catholic Church in March. The Vatican has confirmed that Pope Francis will make his first papal visit to the U.S. in September for a conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but it has not said if the trip with include a stop at the White House to see Obama. Alan Gross embraces an entourage of family and friends who were awaiting his return from five years of captivity in Cuba to Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday. The United States and Cuba agreed on Wednesday to restore diplomatic ties that Washington severed more than 50 years ago, and President Barack Obama called for an end to the long economic embargo against its old Cold War enemy . In a statement to announcing the United States' intentions to 'end an outdated approach' to Cuba and its commitment to 'normalize relations' with the Communist country, Obama thanked the Pope for helping to break down the decades-long barrier of communication with the Castro regime. 'To those who have supported these measures, I thank you for being partners in our efforts. In particular, I want to thank His Holiness Pope Francis, whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be, rather than simply settling for the world as it is,' he said. In a statement of his own, Castro also name-checked His Holiness and acknowledged 'the support of the Vatican. Upon hearing the news that Cuba had released American Alan Gross and more than 50 other political prisoners and that the U.S. planned to reestablish diplomatic relations with the country after 53 years, including the creation of a U.S. embassy in Havana,  the Vatican promised on Wednesday to continue helping the two countries improve their relationship. 'The Holy See will continue to assure its support for initiatives which both nations will undertake to strengthen their bilateral relations and promote the well-being of their respective citizens,' it said in a statement.","'The Pope doesn't wield armies.

"A 28-year-old blonde woman from Maryland is creating a stir on YouTube with her  videos that can create strange sensations for viewers. Maria, as she is known, has been making her soft and sensual videos for three years and has accumulated hundreds of thousands of subscribers. Perhaps more surprisingly, she isn't even providing viewers with any useful information - all she does is smile sweetly and whispers sweet nothings. Doctors say her videos are an example of autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) which results in a distinct, pleasurable tingling in the head, scalp, back, or peripheral regions of the body in response to visual or audio stimuli. Scroll down for video . Listen up! Maria is the host of one of the most popular YouTube channels for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response . Sounds like: Maria, a 28-year-old Russian expat in suburban Maryland, stars in a YouTube video that has been viewed more than 7 million times . Despite the complex-sounding official term ASMR, reactions to her videos are are split with some falling into mesmerized state as they hang on each and every word of her soft-spoken subtle tones. Others have reported becoming fast-irritated at her 'torturous gentle whispers.' The videos play upon the brains' senses using clever, but simple audio and visual techniques. Maria, who was born in Russia will often speak to her viewers in her native tongue. She addresses viewers and listeners wearing headphones to specific ears by using stereo microphones which make her appear as though she is switching sides. Props are then brought out which continue to create sounds that some say they find wildly addictive. Love her or hate her? Maria's voice and movements hold a certain magic: They can instill tranquility and even overcome insomnia . Feeling good: ASMR is widely described as a pleasurable tingling that begins in the head and scalp, shimmies down the spine and relaxes the entire body . Scientists say the videos induce a physical sensation known as autonomous sensory meridian response which feels good. It is a phenomenon characterized as a distinct, pleasurable tingling in the head, scalp, back, or peripheral regions of the body in response to visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or cognitive stimuli. However,The nature and classification of the ASMR phenomenon is controversial. Although there is strong anecdotal evidence to support the phenomenon, there is also little or no scientific explanation or verified data. Whether it be tapping her fingernails on the wooden handle of a hairbrush or pretending to dust your face by using one of her makeup brushes, Maria appears to be enticing viewers to experience something known as autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). Speaking to the Washington Post, Maria says that listening to her will 'flood your body with warm tingles' and feels like 'sand being poured all over you' or 'goosebumps on the brain.' Once someone has tuned in to hear her, the sensations can become addictive. Maria says that ASMR helped her through depression and she believes that her videos can help others feel better too. One-on-one: Some find it hard to explain why someone would watch a 20-minute video with no real plot and no emotional complexity . Maria credits whispering videos to her own continued good mental health. The videos appear to illicit a love-it or hate-it response depending on people's tolerance levels. Some have said that her videos have been transformative. One commentator spoke of how his insomnia was cured after listening to Maria, whilst others were moved to tears.","Millions listen to her  hushed whispers .

"A teenager who was devoted to jeans and T-shirts has swapped her tomboy style in favour of dressing like a real-life doll. Sofia Pettersen-Janes, from Harrow, West London used to opt for a more masculine style but her outfits have seen a complete turnaround as she has added petticoats, bonnets and multicoloured wigs to her everyday wardrobe. The 19-year-old's ensembles are not saved purely for fancy dress, wearing her brightly coloured outfits everywhere from bus stops to the supermarket - with some costing as much as £300. Scroll down for video . Sofia Petterson-Janes swapped her tomboy style for the Japanese Lolita fashion . The textiles student at Nottingham Trent University first found her interest in the unusual doll like style - known as Lolita fashion - two years ago after visiting an Anime Convention in London. At the age of only 17, Sofia became instantly hooked, and started to save every penny she could to fund her new found hobby. Within just two years, Sofia has spent over a staggering £2,000 on perfecting her unique appearance, but she says the expense has been worth it and she finally feels complete. 'I love wearing my outfits, I wouldn't be me if I didn't wear them. 'I adore every single dress and all the accessories, I wouldn't be seen in anything else. I appreciate that it's different but it really is special to me, I feel happy when I wear them.' Sofia admits that her new style is a dramatic change from her previous choice in clothes but she much prefers her feminine outfits. Sofia has recently dyed her hair pink to match her pastel coloured ensembles . Before she dedicated her wardrobe to frills and petticoats Sofia's style was very masculine . Sofia has spent over £2,000 on outfits, this green dress is her favourite and set her back £300 . 'When I was younger I liked Thomas The Tank Engine and stuff guys liked. I used to just wear jeans and a T-shirt - but I always felt like something was missing.' Sofia added that at first not everyone was as fond of her new dress sense but they have since accepted her new style. 'It was a bold and unusual kind of fashion to be wearing but I loved it.' 'My parents were a bit confused at first as it was such a drastic change, my dad would insist I was just playing dress up. 'But it wasn't long until they both came around to my new style of clothes.' At the time, school girl Sofia lived in her school uniform, and her doll clothes were only worn on special occasions. But a year and a half later, Sofia bagged herself a job as a cleaner in a hotel and saved her wages until she was able to afford the wardrobe of her dreams. Sofia says that her look is so unusual she is often approached by tourists in the street for photos . The 19-year-old says that she often faces abuse from strangers on the street because of her unique choice in clothes . Sofia's style is not one that she saves for dressing up and is happy to go about her day to day activities in her Lolita outfits . 'I've now ditched the jeans and choose to opt for corsets almost every day of the week. 'My favourite outfit to date is a mint green dress, it has a row of printed toys along the bottom of the skirt, it's really cute.' This particular outfit set Sofia back by a whopping £300. After recently dying her hair pink to compliment her wardrobe Sofia has seen onlookers take an interest in her and has even had tourists approach her for pictures. Lolita style clothes are few and far between in Britain so many of Sofia's clothes are shipped in from Japan . 'Lots of people ask for a picture with me, but I'm not a tourist attraction!' 'Having pink hair gets you lots of attention, especially when the rest of your outfit matches your hair. Lolita fashion is hard to find in the UK, so Sofia has to look elsewhere for her fill of frills. Her favourite store, Angelic Pretty, is based in Japan and is the biggest and most popular for Lolita fanatics. Sofia says that her obscure taste in fashion has led her to discover a whole community of women who share her enthusiasm. Sofia has been called 'Little Bo Peep' and 'Alice in Wonderland' by strangers in the street . Despite having to cope with some negative comments Sofia says that she feels at her happiest dressed like in her candy coloured ensembles . 'I'm not alone, there's a small community of Lolita fashionistas based in London. We all often meet up at local coffee shops and museums. 'We cause quite a stir in the capital but it's nice to meet up and have something in common - my friends don't understand the latest Lolita fashion.' Despite some negativity, Sofia has many supportive comments from those around her, with many wishing they had her confidence. Being branded as 'Little Bo Peep' and 'Alice in Wonderland' in the streets may cause upset for some, but Sofia remains unfazed and confident in her appearance. 'A few people will shout across the street - but I just ignore them. 'I can dress how I like, it makes me feel happy - so let me wear it!'","Sofia Petterson-Janes swapped masculine style in favour of Lolita fashion .

"The Queen arrived at Kings Lynn station this morning by public train - but not before local police had secured the area. She was en route to Sandringham, her Norfolk estate, where the royal family traditionally spend the Christmas period. But there was no sign of the Duke of Edinburgh, with the Queen arriving accompanied only by her close protection team. Scroll down for video . Christmas holiday: The Queen arrives at Kings Lynn station en route to Sandringham . According to Buckingham Palace sources, the Duke has remained in London but will join the Queen shortly. The monarch has made a habit of taking the train to Sandringham, albeit in First Class, setting off from King's Cross station in London and arriving at Kings Lynn  an hour and a half later. Her Majesty certainly appeared to be looking forward to her break, beaming broadly as she strode down the platform wearing an eau-de-nil tweed coat and one of her trademark floral headscarves. Members of the wider royal family will begin arriving next week with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall expected on Christmas Eve, along with Prince Harry. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, meanwhile, are set to spend their first Christmas at their Norfolk home Anmer Hall but will join the rest of the royal family at Sandringham on the day itself. Sandringham has been owned by the royal family since 1862 when it was purchased by Queen Victoria at the request of her son Edward, then Prince of Wales. Alone: The Queen travelled with  her close protection officers, with Prince Philip nowhere to be seen . Commuter: Her Majesty travelled to Kings Lynn on a normal commuter service, albeit in First Class . Big arrival: The Queen looks up as she arrives after a journey of approximately one and a half hours . Main line: A security guard waits for the train, which began its journey at King's Cross, to come to a stop . Since then, the house has been in continuous use by the royal family and it was there that King George VI died on the 6th February 1952. It is also from Sandringham that the Queen's annual Christmas speech is broadcast, usually uncontroversially, although this year looks set to change all that. Bookies, among them William Hill and Coral, have suspended betting on the Queen revealing abdication plans in this year's speech. Although Buckingham Palace sources have previously said the Queen will never step down, betting was halted following a flurry of surprise wagers. 'Throughout the year there has been major speculation about the Queen's future but the gamble has really caught us by surprise,' said Coral's Nicola McGeady. 'As far as we are concerned there's no smoke without fire when bets like this come through all in succession, so we have decided to be safe rather than sorry and pull the plug on the market.' On her way: The Queen will now remain at Sandringham until mid February . Looking forward to Christmas: The Queen appeared to be looking forward to her break and was all smiles . A Palace spokesperson refused to comment, but did highlight the pledges made by the Queen in her 21st birthday speech in 1947. The young Royal said: 'I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.' In her June 1953 Coronation Day speech, she also said: 'I have in sincerity pledged myself to your service, as so many of you are pledged to mine. Although it is rare for British monarchs to step aside, with Edward VIII the only monarch to do so, the practice is considerably more common in Europe, where no less than four have stood down in the last two years. 2013 was the busiest year for abdications, with Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, King Albert II of Belgium and Pope Benedict XVI all stepping down. Rumours: She has been plagued by abdication rumours after bets were suspended on an announcement . Speech: Bets were placed on an announcement being made during her Christmas Day speech . Playing it safe: Kings Lynn station was searched by police before the Queen's train arrived . New ruler: King Felipe of Spain is the newest European monarch after his father stepped down in June . The following Spring, King Juan-Carlos of Spain, 76, announced plans to step down on the grounds that 'I don't want my son to grow old waiting like Prince Charles'. He formally abdicated on the 18th June, making him the fourth European monarch to do so in less than a year. Despite the flurry of abdications, the Queen has always stated that she has no plans to do the same, despite being older than all of the four. One monarch who may yet do so is Denmark's Queen Margrethe, 74, who has been on the Danish throne for 42 years and has an heir, Crown Prince Frederik, of the same age as 46-year-old King Felipe. However, despite claims in an Australian magazine that an announcement is imminent, sources close to the Danish queen have said she has no intention of stepping down and described the reports as 'all lies'. Stepping up: King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands ascended to the throne on the 30th April 2013 . Monarch: King Philippe of the Belgians took his throne two months after King Willem-Alexander . Next up? The Danish queen, Margrethe II, is rumoured to be stepping down in favour of Prince Frederik (right)","The Queen, 88, arrived at Kings Lynn station by commuter train today .

"Far beyond the orbit of Neptune, trillions of comets left over from the formation of the solar system lie in wait in a region known as the Oort cloud. Here they are kept in relatively stable orbits around the sun, posing little threat to Earth save for the occasional icy rock that ventures inwards. But in the blink of a cosmic eye that could all change, as stars have been found that could pass near our solar system in 240,000 years - and it they might shower us with thousands of deadly comets. A scientist from the Max Planck Institute in Germany says a star could have a closer encounter with Earth 'soon' - in cosmic terms. Dr Coryn Bailer-Jones says there is a 90% chance one will come within 0.6 light-years of Earth in 500,000 years. This could send comets towards our planet (illustrated) According to Dr Coryn Bailer-Jones from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, there are several stars that could pose a danger to our solar system. As our sun performs its cosmic dance around the Milky Way, it comes closer to and further from other stars in the vicinity. The star of most danger is Hip 85605, a star slightly smaller than our sun that has a 90 per cent chance of coming between 0.13 and 0.65 light-years of Earth in 240,000 to 470,000 years. The Oort cloud is a vast and mysterious region that is thought to surround our solar system. It contains trillions of comets left over from the birth of the universe - and possibly larger objects like dwarf planets as well. It begins at about 0.08 light-years from the sun - 170 times the orbit of Neptune - and extends out to about 0.8 light-years. Occasionally, comets from the region make their way into the solar system, known as long-period comets. One of the most famous this year was comet Siding Spring, which brushed past Mars on 19 October. However, apart from these brief visitors, not much is known about the Oort cloud. It has never been directly observed, and it is not exactly known how large it is - although it is thought to define the gravitational influence of the sun. This may sound distant, but considering the Oort cloud extends to about 0.8 light-years, it is clearly too close for comfort. Dr Bailer-Jones says an approaching star could disturb this region and be a threat to Earth. ‘Stars which pass close to the sun can perturb the Oort cloud, injecting comets into the inner solar system where they may collide with the Earth,’ he wrote in his paper. He used data from Esa’s Hipparcos spacecraft, which scanned the sky in the 1990s, to study the future of 50,000 stars. The possibility that an incoming star could disturb the Oort cloud in such a way to threaten the planets has been known for a while. But this is one of the most accurate estimates yet for when and where a star will actually approach the solar system. It should be noted that the position and motion of Hip 85605 may be incorrect, meaning it will not pass so close. But even so, there are other stars that will take its place. A dwarf called GL 710, for example, has a 90 per cent chance of coming within 0.3 to 1.4 light-years in 1.3 million years. The Oort cloud (illustrated) is a vast and mysterious region that is thought to surround our solar system. It contains trillions of comets left over from the birth of the universe - and possibly larger objects like dwarf planets as well. Long-period comets originate here, while short-period comets come from the Kuiper Belt . Speaking to MailOnline, Dr Bailer-Jones said that while the star could come close in cosmic terms, it might not be obviously noticeable to our distant descendants. In addition, he says the process through which comets are sent into the solar system will take millions of years, and will likely increase the current rate of 10 or so comets a year to a hundred. ‘If there are people around at that time in the future and they look up in the night sky, they wouldn’t particularly notice the star,’ he explained. ‘Calculation of one object suggests it would be slightly brighter than Venus, which is pretty bright, but not as bright as the moon or sun or anything.’ But he says such an encounter is ‘inevitable,’ although the chances of a star actually entering the solar system is close to zero. Using Hipparcos data, Dr Bailer-Jones has been able to look forward and back in to the future about 20 million years. With data from the Gaia spacecraft, however, he hopes to extend this to about 50 million years - which will likely reveal more stars that once encountered our solar system, or will do in the future. Dr Bailer-Jones used data from Esa’s Hipparcos spacecraft, shown left, which scanned the sky in the 1990s, to study the future of 50,000 stars. He plans to use data from the Gaia spacecraft (illustrated right) in 2016 to create even more accurate models of future and past stellar encounters with Earth . It's believed that a stellar encounter in the past may have caused comets to come towards Earth, possibly even causing the rock that killed the dinosaurs (illustration shown) to hit our planet. Dr Bailer-Jones hopes to use data to look 'back in time' and see if this is true . It is not just a disturbance in the Oort cloud that would threaten life on Earth, but also radiation from the stars themselves. ‘If intense enough - and in particular if the star turned supernova during an encounter - then such ionising radiation could kill organisms outright, erode the Earth’s ozone layer to expose life to harmful solar UV radiation, or induce long-term global calling through the nitrogen dioxide produced in our atmosphere,’ wrote Dr Bailer-Jones. He notes that there are several events throughout history that have been linked to cosmic events. The mass extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, for example, was almost certainly formed by some form of large impact. A layer of iron-60 radioisotopes deposited at the bottom of the ocean 2.8 million years ago, meanwhile, is suspected to be the result of a nearby supernova. And other nearby supernova have been blamed for more mass extinctions on Earth. Dr Bailer-Jones says to truly know how much danger we will be in, though, more data is needed. This will hopefully be returned by Esa’s Gaia spacecraft in 2016, which is currently mapping one billion stars in the Milky Way - one per cent of its total stars. And he also wants to use the data to look backwards in time, and see if any craters on Earth could be explained by close passes of stars.","A scientist from the Max Planck Institute in Germany says a star could have a 'close' encounter with Earth in as soon as a quarter of a million years .
Dr Coryn Bailer-Jones said the closest approaching star has a 90% chance of coming within 0.6 light years of Earth in 500,000 years .
Other stars could also come close in 240,000 to 470,000 years .
This could disturb the orbits of comets - sending them towards Earth .
Radiation from a star could also kill organisms if it went supernova during the approach - although none such have been found yet .
But he says the event of a star having a close encounter with our solar system - even if it doesn't explode - is 'inevitable' at some point ."

"Bells tolled in celebration and teachers halted lessons midday as President Raul Castro told his country that Cuba was restoring relations with the U.S. after more than a half-century of hostility. Wearing his military uniform with its five-star insignia, the 83-year-old leader said the two countries would work to resolve their differences 'without renouncing a single one of our principles.' Havana residents gathered around television sets in homes, schools and businesses to hear the historic national broadcast, which coincided with a statement by U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington. Scroll down for video . A group of Cuban students march through the capital of Havana to celebrate the easing of political tensions . Banners and flags supporting the recently-released 'Cuban Five' were carried by the group. The group of Cuban spies, jailed by the U.S. in 1998, are supported widely across the country . A carload of locals wave posters adorned with the faces of the 'Cuban Five' along the streets of Havana . At the University of San Geronimo in the capital's historic center, the announcement drew ringing from the bell tower. Throughout the capital, there was a sense of euphoria as word spread. 'For the Cuban people, I think this is like a shot of oxygen, a wish-come-true, because with this, we have overcome our differences,' said Carlos Gonzalez, a 32-year-old IT specialist. 'It is an advance that will open the road to a better future for the two countries.' Guillermo Delgado, a 72-year-old retiree, welcomed the announcement as 'a victory for Cuba because it was achieved without conceding basic principles.' Yoani Sanchez, a renowned Cuban blogger critical of the government, however, said the development came with a price. A large crowd spills out into the streets of the nation's capital following the historic announcement . U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuba's Raul Castro agreed by phone to a prisoner exchange, whereby the two countries would release respectively imprisoned Cold War spies. Pictured are the throngs of people celebrating the news in Cuba . Castro, she wrote, had made a 'bargaining chip' of Alan Gross, the U.S. aid worker who was released from prison Wednesday while the U.S. freed three Cubans held as spies. 'In this way, the Castro regime has managed to get its way,' she wrote in a blog post. 'It has managed to exchange a peaceful man, embarked on the humanitarian adventure of providing Internet connectivity to a group of Cubans, for intelligence agents that caused significant damage and sorrow with their actions.' Fidel and Raul Castro led the 1959 rebellion that toppled the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. The U.S. initially recognized the new government but broke relations in 1961 after Cuba veered sharply to the left and nationalized U.S.-owned businesses. Cuban MPs break down in tears as they watch a broadcast showing President Raul Castro's announcement . Students watch a live, nationally broadcast speech by Cuba's President Raul Castro about the country's restoration of relations with the U.S. on a TV at a school in Havana . As Cuba turned toward the Soviet Union, the U.S. imposed a trade embargo that has remained in place since 1962. Particularly since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Cubans have confronted severe shortages of oil, food and consumer goods, forcing them to ration everything from beans to powdered milk. The Cuban government blames most of its economic travails on the embargo, while Washington has traditionally blamed Cuba's Communist economic policies.","Cubans take to the streets to celebrate the restoration of relations with U.S.

"When it launched Apple Pay in the US earlier this year, the tech firm was tight-lipped about when the service would rollout to other regions. But now a job listing may have inadvertently let slip the service is on its way to Europe, the Middle East, Asia, India and Africa. The listing, first spotted by iClarified, has since been taken down suggesting either the position has been filled, or Apple wasn't ready to make the announcement. The job listing revealed Apple is looking to hire an Apple Pay Intern to help expand the service across Europe, Middle East, India and Africa. However, a precise rollout schedule was not included. The listing has since been taken down suggesting either the position has been filled, or the firm wasn't ready to make the announcement . Apple has not responded to MailOnline's request for comment. Apple boss Tim Cook announced Apple Pay at the launch event for the firm's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in September. The service launched in the US in October and is currently accepted by more than 220,000 retailers, and 17 banks in the country. Visa's Pedro Sousa announced shortly after the launch that it was working to bring Apple Pay to the UK 'early next year', but no specific details were given. This latest job listing bolster's Mr Sousa's comments Apple Pay may launch in the region within months. Apple Pay launched earlier this year and lets people with an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus pay for goods by tapping their handsets on NFC readers. It works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. Apple Pay is currently available in more than 220,000 shops, and 17 banks, in the US. Visa has already said it is working with Apple to bring the service to the UK next year. According to the listing: 'Apple Pay is a new and exciting area that is set to expand across Europe, Middle East, India and Africa. 'The new London-based Apple Pay team will work to drive the rollout of this technology by working with a variety of internal and external partners, as well as issuers, payment networks and merchants across Europe.' in particular, Apple is said to be looking for an intern to handle non-disclosure agreements and contracts with these partners. There was a related listing, posted in China, for an Apple Pay Site Reliability Engineer. However, the rollout may be a gradual, especially in Europe, as Apple will need to get the approval of the European Union Council of Ministers, in addition to signing deals with multiple retailers and banks. The ministers recently recommended new rules for mobile payments. EU legislators said that any payment service must have 'strong customer authentication', and licences may be required for individual states. The rollout may also be brought forward following the news earlier this week that Samsung is looking to launch an Apple Pay rival. Sources told Re/code that the South Korean tech giant is in talks with startup LoopPay to let people pay for goods using their phones. Samsung has previously allowed NFC payments on certain networks and with partners including Barclaycard, but if it teamed up with LoopPay, the service would be expanded more widely.

"Who wouldn’t want to spend hours in a room with Brad Pitt? Apparently, not members of the Los Angeles Criminal Court. MailOnline can report exclusively that Pitt, who turns 51 today, showed up at the court house in downtown LA last Friday to be interviewed for jury duty along with dozens of other potential jurors. But after waiting hours for his turn in the jury box, the court let him know his services wouldn’t be needed - he’d be too much of a distraction. Although it would also have been difficult for Brad to make time in his busy schedule to serve on a jury, he actually thought it would be interesting, a Pitt insider tells MailOnline. Distracting:  Brad PItt, Pax Shiloh and Maddox attending the 'Unbroken' premiere in Los Angeles Pitt was called for jury duty at the downtown criminal court. He was prepared to serve but hoped it would be a short trial so he could get back to work -  his ailing wife Angelina Jolie . Pitt was also summoned to serve in 2003. It is not known if he actually served on a jury but he was not sent home. He wore a juror badge, had a Subway sandwich for lunch with the other potential jurors . ‘Brad was hoping he might get picked to serve on a short case,’ says the source. ‘But the problem was, he would actually be required to serve for as long as it took for the case to be decided. Most cases in Los Angeles are decided within a seven-day period, but if the case goes longer, the juror would be have to remain on the jury for as long as it takes. According to LA attorney William R. Lively, potential jurors are randomly selected from a community using driver’s licenses, State ID’s and voter registration lists. In most cases, the fact a person is a celebrity isn’t noticed until that person actually shows up at court. ‘Like any other potential juror, Brad would have received a jury summons that required him to travel downtown and be interviewed by the judge or attorneys in what is called voir dire,” Lively tells MailOnline exclusively. ‘This is a system of examination whereby both the prosecution and defense have the opportunity to object to a particular juror. ‘In most cases as soon as it’s discovered that a potential juror is a major celebrity, that person is dismissed, but that is not always the case.’ Pitt was called for jury duty in 2003. It is not known if he actually served on a jury but he was not sent home. He wore a juror badge, had a Subway sandwich for lunch with the other prospective jurors. In September, 2013, actor Tom Hanks was chosen to sit for a domestic violence court case in LA. But his jury duty ended abruptly amid allegations of jury tampering, when a female member of the LA City Attorney’s Office allegedly approached Hanks in the hall during a lunch break, telling him how impressed everyone in the prosecutor’s office was that such a big celebrity would be serving jury duty. ‘Lawyers for the defense immediately asked the judge for a hearing to prove prosecutorial misconduct,’ says Lively, ‘insinuating the prosecutors were ‘star struck,’ by Hank’s presence. ‘The accused, who had been facing up to a year in jail if convicted, ended up making a plea deal to a lesser charge of disturbing the peace – a minor infraction – paid a fine of just $150, and the case was dismissed.’ A pox on you:  Last week a nasty email  between famed Hollywood director Scott Rudin and Sony Chairwoman, Amy Pascal, referred to Jolie as ‘a minimally talented spoiled brat.’ Some speculated Jolie was faking her chicken pox breakout in order to avoid being asked publicly about the embarrassing Sony hacking leak . In September, 2013, actor Tom Hanks was chosen to sit for a domestic violence court case in LA. But his jury duty ended abruptly amid allegations of jury tampering, when a female member of the LA City Attorney’s Office allegedly approached Hanks in the hall during a lunch break . Lively says it’s almost impossible for a celebrity – especially one of Brad Pitt’s caliber - to go unnoticed during a trial. And because every person accused of a crime has the right to have all eyes and ears on him or her as they plead their case, Brad would be a huge distraction. “You just can’t stick Brad Pitt in a jury box and expect 11 jurors to ignore him,’ adds Lively, who heads up his own criminal and civil law practice in Santa Clarita, California. ‘It’s only natural that those jurors would be watching to see how Brad reacts to what’s being said and that they could be influenced by his opinions once the jury goes behind closed doors to render a verdict.’ ‘Now that Angelina is out of commission with the chicken pox, Brad has been picking up the slack both at home and work,’ says the insider. ‘So it would have been hard for him to comply had he been chosen.'

"A man on board a Chinese domestic flight caused panic when he opened the emergency exit just before take off as he 'wanted some fresh air.' The incident was shared on social media, with photos of a middle-aged man in a blue coat leaning out of the exit going viral. It is believed after being questioned, he admitted to being a first-time flyer and was unaware that his actions could be deemed a serious breach. Scroll down for video . A Chinese man opened the emergency exit just before take off after wanting some 'fresh air' The passenger was on board the Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu, and although cabin crew managed to diffuse the situation quickly and the flight took off on time, it is the latest incident to mar China flights. As photos of the incident circulated online, it was met with disbelief. 'Just insane! Chinese passenger opens emergency door ‘to get fresh air’ as plane prepare to fly,' wrote George Chen on Twitter. 'Guy wants fresh air on a plane & tries to open an EMERGENCY EXIT MID-FLIGHT. This is a whole new division of stupid,' added Bongo. Vision Times wrote on Twitter: 'This Definitely Isn’t a Good Reason for Opening the Emergency Exit on a Plane.' Only days before, a Chinese man had opened the emergency exit and deployed the slide after wanting to 'get off quicker' from his China Eastern flight MU2331 that has landed at Sanya Fenghaung International Airport in Hainan. By activating the emergency exit, he deployed the emergency slide; the whole event caused an almost two-hour delay to the flight. When asked why he had broken the rules, the passenger replied by saying he had 'wanted to get off the plane quicker.' He also claimed he had not listened to the in-flight instructions, saying that he was not aware you couldn't use the emergency exit to disembark. The on-board flight attendants tried in vain to prevent the slide from deploying, but were caught short. The man's actions, not only caused delays to his fellow passengers, but is also estimated to have cost the airline £10,000 ($15,724). Prior to this, a Chinese woman scalded a flight attendant by throwing a cup of hot noodles after finding out she wouldn't be sat next to her boyfriend. The incident occurred on a charter flight from Bangkok to Nanjing, China, and passengers were on hand to pull out their smartphones as the mid-air drama unfolded in front of them, snapping pictures as the injured flight attendant covered her face and shouted in pain. During the chaos a man believed to be the woman's boyfriend jumped out of his seat and angrily threatened to blow up the plane as the injured flight attendant was tended to by her co-workers. But the man accused of making the threat later said the attendant was scalded by accident during a tussle over a receipt they had requested for the hot water.","Passenger was on board the Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu .

"Women who were told by a bungling doctor they were free of breast cancer after a screening have now been diagnosed with the disease. The six women were given the devastating news after being screened at the Oxfordshire Breast Screening Service at Churchill Hospital . Now receiving treatment for cancer, they were among 30 women sent letters by the trust in August, asking them to return for tests at Churchill Hospital as a matter of urgency. Six women were diagnosed with breast cancer after initially being told they were free of the disease following a screening at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford (pictured) These women were identified as having possibly been given incorrect information after their follow-up breast cancer screening. The decision to review all patients screened by this one radiologist was triggered earlier this year when four women were found to have developed breast cancer despite being given the all clear. Therefore the latest diagnosis of these six other women takes the number who were wrongly told they were cancer free to 10. The letters were sent after a review of 624 women assessed by one radiologist between 2011 and 2014 at the hospital was launched. While the radiologist responsible is not carrying out screenings anymore, they are still operating at the hospital in a different department. A spokeswoman for the Trust said the investigation as to whether they will face disciplinary action is ongoing. However, she confirmed the doctor has not carried out any assessments since investigations began. The Trust's medical director, Dr Tony Berendt, said the six women were now undergoing treatment and had received an apology from the trust. He said: 'Regrettably, following further tests, six women have received a diagnosis of breast cancer. 'Our priority has been to ensure that we have picked up all breast abnormalities and investigated them thoroughly. Oxfordshire University Hospitals Trust reviewed 624 women who had been assessed by one radiologist at the hospital. A total of ten women told they were all clear following a screening have no developed breast cancer (file photo) 'We, of course, recognise the impact of this issue for all concerned, and we are extremely sorry that as part of this extensive review six women have received a diagnosis of breast cancer. 'An investigation is being undertaken in line with the relevant trust procedures. There is no conclusion yet.' He added: 'We recognise the anxiety that this review could cause to women in Oxfordshire who currently undergo three-yearly routine breast mammograms. 'However, I would like to reassure women that there are no concerns about the function of the county's breast screening programme. 'It is important for women to attend their routine mammogram appointments when called and they can be confident about the service they receive.'","Women had been screened at Churchill Hospital in Oxford .

"Princess Beatrice and her little sister Eugenie are often the subject of heated debate when it comes to understanding what it is some members of the Royal family actually do... and how they make themselves useful. But having spent two days enjoying herself at Royal Ascot with other members of her family - including her grandmother the Queen and her father Prince Andrew - today the young princess, 24, who graduated from Goldsmiths, University of London, in 2011 with a 2:1, decided to prove she can earn her keep. So the fifth in line to the throne put away her elaborate hats, folded up her elegantly bejeweled dresses, donned her smartest, most serious attire, and travelled to Halifax, West Yorkshire, to officially open the new Trinity Academy school and then visit the Forget Me Not Children's Hospice and attend a luncheon and fashion show at The University of Huddersfield. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Princess Beatrice gives the thumbs-up to some children after they gave a musical performance, and then told pupils and staff: 'I wish I came to a school like this' Princess Beatrice stands behind PE students as they watch a video during a lesson, before she officially opened Trinity Academy school in Halifax today . Touring the newly built academy, the princess, who battled dyslexia when she attended Upton House School in Windsor, Coworth Park School in Surrey and St. George's School in Ascot, said: 'I wish I came to a school like this'. During her 50 minute tour of the academy, . Beatrice was given a demonstration by the Trinity Tigers cheerleading . team, she sat in on a science class and seemed particularly interested . in the dressmaking sessions in the open-plan art-and-design studios. Later, her reactions were fast enough to . catch the mini-curtain she pulled back to reveal the plaque to mark her . visit, when it collapsed at the crucial moment. The young royal looked genuinely impressed by the Academy's state-of-the-art facilities, and as hundreds of students gathered in the . main atrium, she told the whole school: 'I have never spoken to this . many people before. It is quite amazing.' One student said of the princess: 'It was . strange seeing her after only seeing her in photographs. It was . exciting. I don't know how she walked in those heels down those stairs' Princess Beatrice reacts quickly, catching the curtain after accidentally pulling off the rail while revealing the plaque at Trinity Academy school in Halifax . Speaking without notes, she said: 'I'm so honoured to be here today. I'm so honoured to see this amazing place. 'You're so lucky to be in an academy like this, to be in a school like this, where everything can be brought together, where young people can be taught these amazing life skills in this incredible space. 'And I thank everyone who has made this possible, to bring this community together and to make this building as spectacular as it is and to give you all the most amazing opportunities that young people deserve in the UK.' She continued: 'I'm just so excited to be here. I've seen so many of the classes - the science, the performance, the cheerleaders - I mean, I wish came to a school like this.' Her joke was greeted with laughter and applause. Princess Beatrice reacts with good humour to the rail and curtain falling off the plaque . Reminiscing, the princess told the children: 'Enjoy every moment of school. It is the best time.' She confessed she was not very good at science and, as she complimented some of the students on their 'amazing' art work, admitted: 'I ended up doing a sculpture. I took it home and it disintegrated.' The princess wore a navy blue jacket over a white blouse and a royal blue skirt with navy blue shoes. Academy principal Michael Gosling said: 'All the way round the princess was talking about how school wasn't like this when she went to school.' Reminiscing, the princess told the children: 'Enjoy every moment of school. It is the best time.' Princess Beatrice watching the children do experiments in the science lab, before admitting she hadn't been very good at the subject at school . He said: 'In the build up to the visit the student have been very giddy. This morning, excitement was at fever pitch. They were really looking forward to the visit.' Mr Gosling said: 'Her down-to-earth approach came through. And she caught the curtain as well.' Student Amy Moran, 17, said: 'It was strange seeing her after only seeing her in photographs. It was exciting. I don't know how she walked in those heels down those stairs.' The visit to the school was the first part of a three-stop tour of West Yorkshire for the princess today.

The day will be quite a change of scene for the Queen's granddaughter, who for the past two days has been at Royal Ascot in Berkshire with her family. Yesterday Princess Beatrice was pictured celebrating jubilantly in the Royal box when the Queen's horse Estimate shot round the course to win the Gold Cup for the monarch. Last weekend she attended the Trooping of the Colour in London on Saturday, riding in the carriage with her sister Eugenie, and on Sunday she went to the Cartier Queen's Cup polo tournament final at Guards Polo in Windsor Great Park, Berkshire, with her boyfriend of seven years Dave Clark. It was recently announced that the princess will be focusing more on a career in finance than royal engagements and duties, so today's visits will be some of the small handful she will perform this year.

"The eyes of world were focussed on the Lindt café in Sydney as a mad lone gunman terrorised 18 innocent hostages. For 17 hours, little was known about the figure that TV cameras caught glimpses of in the window, or the nightmare he was subjecting his victims to. The man grew more agitated as he realised the demands he was forcing his hostages to post online were not being met, or even broadcast. But after his siege ended in gunfire killing two of his captives, details of self-proclaimed sheik Man Haron Monis - and a timeline of events during the terrifying hours he held his hostages captive - started coming together.

"One in five children in some areas are shunning Nick Clegg's free school meals in favour of packed lunches, official figures reveal today. Almost 300,000 four to seven-year-olds across the country are failing to claim their free meal amid concerns over the quality of lunches at some schools. Take-up varies across areas and is as low as 81.5 per cent in the south east, according to a census of schools in October being released today. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg tucks into a mince pie after making them with year 5 pupils in West London . Mr Clegg remained bullish about his free school meals policy during a visit to Hallfield Primary School . Mr Clegg said: 'The naysayers about this policy can eat their hats, and all the leftover sprouts' The survey is the first indication of the impact of the Deputy Prime Minister's cherished £1billion policy of serving free meals to pupils in the first three years of primary school. Take-up was expected to be 87 per cent but only three out of 10 English regions reached this level – the north east, the north west and inner London. Across the country, 85 per cent of pupils claimed their free lunch – some 1.64million. But 285,490 pupils – more than one in seven – preferred to take in their own packed lunch. The figure also includes an unknown number of pupils who were absent on census day. Take-up was lowest in the south east, followed by the east of England, where 82.8 per cent took a free meal and the east midlands, where the figure was 82.9 per cent. Ministers recently announced extra funding for kitchen renovations to help more schools cook hot meals on the premises instead of transporting them in. Documents linked to the announcement reveal that some schools are transporting in at least 250 hot meals every day. Meanwhile a row broke out in Birmingham earlier this term after reception pupils at some schools were revealed to have been offered just one chicken nugget at lunchtime, while Year One pupils got two. The take-up figures emerged as Mr Clegg was challenged by academics who analysed the impact of free meals in two areas which ran a trial scheme of universal provision. Mr Clegg has repeatedly hailed the trials – in Newham and Durham – as evidence that his policy will produce a range of specific benefits. In a blow to Mr Clegg, 285,490 pupils – more than one in seven – preferred to take in their own packed lunch . Take-up is as low as 81.5 per cent in the south east, according to a census of schools in October . However the researchers – from the Institute for Fiscal Studies - said he was wrong to claim that healthy hot lunches can be better at raising pupils` results than many literacy and numeracy initiatives. And they warned against assuming that results from the pilot schemes would be repeated across the country. Senior Researcher Ellen Greaves said: 'We did find that offering free school meals to all pupils in primary schools lead to higher take-up of school meals, and improvements in…test results. 'On average, pupils in the pilot areas made between four and eight weeks' more progress over the two year pilot than similar pupils in comparison areas. But it is not clear from this evidence that these positive outcomes will be repeated in the roll out of free school meals to all infant pupils across the country.' She added that the team 'found no evidence of significant differences in behaviour, health or nutrition'. Steve Higgins, professor of education at Durham University, said the evidence for the scheme was 'very weak'. But Mr Clegg was bullish yesterday as he visited a school in London to help with Christmas cooking. 'Well over a million and a half infants are enjoying a school meal at lunchtime, giving them a better start to afternoon lessons and a healthy boost for their first years in school,' he said. 'The other good news for families is that this saves them up to £400 per child a year on the cost of a packed lunch. 'The naysayers about this policy can eat their hats, and all the leftover sprouts.' He insisted that only one per cent of packed lunches meet the nutritional standards that currently apply to school food.","More than one in seven pupils prefer to take in their own packed lunch .

"The policy of killing terrorists using unmanned drone strikes can be counter-productive and increase support for insurgent groups, the CIA acknowledged in a secret report. A CIA document reviewing attacks carried out by countries involved in counter-insurgency operations has revealed the agency is aware of the drawbacks when using the controversial tactic. Drone warfare became increasingly important to the U.S. military towards the end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as a way to collect intelligence and conduct airstrikes without risking American lives. Scroll down for video . Airstrikes carried out by drones such as this MQ-9 Reaper can be counter-productive, a leaked report claims . However, the tactic has been criticised for its potential to be used for terrorist propaganda and for causing civilian casualties. Based on a classified file released by Wikileaks, The Sydney Morning Herald reported the 2009 study as stating drone strikes 'may increase support for the insurgents, particularly if these strikes enhance insurgent leaders' lore'. It warns the insurgents' support could also increase if 'non-combatants are killed in the attacks, if legitimate or semi-legitimate politicians aligned with the insurgents are targeted, or if the government is already seen as overly repressive or violent'. However, it said drone strikes could be useful if carried out as part of a wider strategy that involved conventional methods. In 2009, 257 drone strikes were conducted in Afghanistan. That number climbed slightly to 277 in 2010 and there was a small bump up in 2011 to 294, though the data can change due to recalculation. Come 2012 drone strikes became more frequent, climbing to 494 as the tactic became a cornerstone of U.S. strategy after President Obama pledged to reduce the number of troops fighting in the Middle East. Hakimullah Mehsud (pictured centre in brown hat) was head of the Pakistani Taliban until his death in a U.S. drone strike. His replacement went on to orchestrate the recent massacre of 132 people in a Pakistani school . The U.S. has a massive arsenal of MQ-18 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper drones, capable of delivering Hellfire missiles more than 1,100 miles away. The Reaper drones can also deliver 500-pound bomb payloads. The 'unmanned aerial vehicles' are controlled from a land or ship base. According to public sources, America has 172 Predator drones and 97 Reapers. Any one of them could be launched to eliminate terror leaders, including the warlords at the tip of the ISIS spear. They are typically used by the U.S. Air Force and CIA to decimate enemy bases of operations and eliminate specific terrorist targets – including training camps and individual combatants. It is believed targeted strikes on insurgent leaders leave their troops in disarray, but numerous examples referenced in the CIA study showed that Taliban and Al-Qaeda operated fluid lower-management divisions which could easily replace killed leaders.","Policy of using drone strikes can be 'counter-productive', report states .

"United in mourning, the current and former leaders of the scandal-ravaged Lib Dems came together yesterday at the funeral of Jeremy Thorpe. Nick Clegg and his predecessors Sir Menzies Campbell, Charles Kennedy, Lord Ashdown and Lord Steel watched as the disgraced former Liberal leader’s Union Flag-draped coffin was carried out of the church – with his trademark trilby sitting on top. Controversial Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard also attended with his wife, who was making a rare appearance after keeping a low profile while he faced accusations of molesting women. Scroll down for video . The funeral of Jeremy Thorpe was held today at St Margaret's Church, in Westminster. The Deputy Prime Minister was joined by four other successors of Thorpe as head of the Liberal movement. (left-right Lord Ashdown, Lord Steel, Charles Kennedy and Sir Menzies Campbell . Mr Thorpe led the Liberal Party for nine years from 1967 until he was sensationally brought down following a sex scandal in which he was accused of plotting to murder former male model Norman Scott, who claimed to have had a gay affair with him. The twice-married politician, who died aged 85 earlier this month after suffering from Parkinson’s Disease, was acquitted at the Old Bailey in 1979 but lost his seat as an MP shortly before the trial began. Mr Thorpe was Liberal leader when Cyril Smith was first elected the party’s MP for Rochdale. After Smith’s death, numerous allegations have emerged that he was a serial child sex abuser .

Lord Ashdown appeared to be wiping his eyes following the service. Thorpe's glittering career ended in disgrace when he was embroiled in a gay sex scandal . Former Liberal Democrat party leader Charles Kennedy. The scandal surrounding Thorpe culminated in a sensational 1979 court case in which he was accused of conspiracy and incitement to murder . Delivering a tribute to Mr Thorpe at St Margaret’s Church in Westminster, former Lib Dem minister Sir Nick Harvey, who now represents Mr Thorpe’s old North Devon constituency, praised his ‘wit, zeal and sheer panache’. Friend and colleague Steven Atack told the congregation that the party – which merged with the SDP to form the Lib Dems in 1987 – had ‘never found it in its heart’ to re-embrace Mr Thorpe after his downfall. ‘It would have meant a great deal to him that his successors as Liberal leaders are here today,’ he added. Lord Rennard’s wife Ann McTegart looked pensive as they joined mourners. At 65, the former nursery school teacher is 11 years older than her husband, to whom she has been married for 25 years. Thorpe who became the Liberal leader in 1967 was credited with reviving the party's fortunes in the 1970s . Controversial peer Lord Rennard (centre), accompanied Lord Steel and his wife Judith to the ceremony . Lord Renard, Lib Dem chief executive between 2003 and 2009, was suspended earlier this year after a series of women accused him of making sexual advances. He denied the allegations, but issued an apology for encroaching on some of the women’s ‘personal space’. In August the suspension was controversially lifted, although he was told he would have no role in next year’s election campaign. Last month, Lord Rennard questioned whether Mr Clegg is still leading a ‘major party’ following his by-election humiliation in Rochester, where the Lib Dems came fifth with less than 1 per cent of the vote. The barbed accusation was seen as revenge on the Deputy Prime Minister for not allowing him back into the heart of the party. Lord Steel, 76, became leader in 1976 and was succeeded in 1988 by Lord Ashdown, 73, who stood down in 1999 and retired from the Commons in 2001. Mr Kennedy, 55, led the party from 1999 until 2006 and Sir Menzies, 73, was the leader until the following year, when Mr Clegg took over.

"The family of a black man fatally shot by a white police officer as he held an air rifle inside an Ohio Wal-Mart filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday charging negligence and violation of the man's civil rights. The lawsuit was filed in US District Court in Dayton against the City of Beavercreek, the two Beavercreek officers involved, the police chief and Wal-mart Stores Inc. John Crawford III was shot August 5 inside the store in the Dayton suburb. Police responded after a 911 caller reported Crawford was waving what appeared to be a firearm, which was later determined to be an airsoft gun. Scroll down for video . Legal action: The family of police shooting victim John Crawford III, right, pictured with his mother, Tressa Sherrod, filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday charging negligence and violation of the man's civil rights . John H. Crawford Jr., center, father of John Crawford III, stands with attorneys Michael Wright, left, and Shean Williams during a press conference Tuesday . A grand jury concluded the shooting was justified. 'All we want is justice for John Crawford,' the family's attorney, Michael Wright said at a news conference Tuesday. Crawford's family has said previously that it was 'incomprehensible' that officers weren't indicted. The family have sought a federal investigation to see if race was a factor, and the US Justice Department has been reviewing the shooting. The police officer who fatally shot 22-year-old Crawford has said the man didn't respond to repeated commands to drop the weapon in his hands, which turned out to be a BB gun . Crawford's death also has drawn demonstrations from protesters criticizing the shootings of young black men by police around the country, with some suggesting race was a factor. Wright said the criminal justice system has so far refused to hold the officers accountable and that it is necessary for the civil justice system to do so. He said Crawford was just shopping and talking on his cellphone when he was shot. 'John Crawford did nothing wrong,' Wright said. The police officer who fatally shot 22-year-old Crawford has said the man didn't respond to repeated commands to drop the weapon and turned toward officers in an aggressive manner. A Wal-mart spokeswoman said Tuesday that the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company takes its stores' safety and security very seriously. 'Out of respect for everyone involved, we believe it's not appropriate to discuss the specifics of this matter, but we can say that our associates acted properly,' Wal-mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said in an email. Beavercreek's city attorney, speaking for the city and police, said in an email Tuesday that they are confident the trial will be fair. 'We believe the evidence will show that the officer's actions were legally justified,' said Steve McHugh. The lawsuit charges that all the defendants were guilty of negligence and that the officers were guilty of recklessness and depriving Crawford of his constitutional rights, including the right to be free of unreasonable seizures and excessive use of force. Moments before: Crawford can be seen above moments before he is killed by officer Sean Williams . Outcry: Crawford's death  has drawn demonstrations from protesters criticizing the shootings of young black men by police . The lawsuit also alleges that Wal-mart was negligent 'concerning the placement of guns at its stores and also acted negligently in failing to secure' the air rifle, which the family's attorneys said was left unpackaged on a shelf. Wright said the family hopes the lawsuit will bring changes in the police department and Wal-Mart's merchandising practices. 'We want to be sure that this tragedy does not happen to any other family,' he said. The lawsuit seeks at damages of at least $75,000, but that amount could change as the case proceeds, attorneys said.","Lawsuit names City of Beavercreek, Ohio, two officers involved in John Crawford III's death, the police chief and Wal-mart Stores Inc .

"A blind widow has barely missed a  game of her beloved Yeovil Town FC in 17 years, after becoming hooked on the roar of the crowd. Audrey Dyson began attending the team's home matches with her only son Nigel after the death of her husband Bob, 77, who was an avid Yeovil fan. The 90-year-old, who lost her sight two decades ago, has never physically 'seen' a match but was captivated by the cheers of the crowd, so much so that in 17 years, she has almost never missed a home game. Yeovil Town fan Audrey Dyson (pictured) goes to practically every home game including her team's match against Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup . Audrey follows each game on local radio commentary from her regular seat where she proudly wears a green and white Yeovil shirt with matching hand-knitted blanket for her knees. She cheered on her club this week when they beat Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup to line up a Third Round home clash against Manchester United in the New Year. Audrey, a retired chemist and bookkeeper, said: 'Around 17 years ago my husband died and I'm blind and I can't get out on my own. 'My son said to me there was a friendly match down at Yeovil - he had been going since he was 16 - where they were playing Stevenage. Despite being blind, the 90-year-old goes with her son Nigel Dyson (pictured) 50, after he suggested he join her following the death of her husband . Mrs Dyson has been a Yeovil Town fan for 17 years despite never having 'seen' the actual game play . The pensioner, who always wears her Yeovil Town shirt, and scarf to the matches, became hooked after hearing the roar of the crowd . 'I had never been before but I said I would go. When Yeovil scored a goal, the noise they made and the whole atmosphere, it was just electric. It just thrilled me and I was hooked. 'My son asked me if I wanted to go again, and I said I would and I went for the rest of the season, buying a ticket each time. 'The next season I bought a season ticket and I've had one ever since.' She added: 'I take a radio with headphones and listen to BBC Somerset, and despite not being able to see it means I can follow the game ball by ball, along with the atmosphere all around me. 'We know the people who sit around us very well now, and they are all very helpful. 'I went to the doctors recently and asked if there was anything they could do, but he said to me if I was his grandmother, he wouldn't recommend an operation. 'I've got used to things now, and I just get on with it. I enjoy the game as it is. 'It seems to fascinate people the fact that I'm blind, and I'm 90. 'I think people probably laugh and think I'm a bit odd, but I don't mind that - I'm enjoying myself.' Audrey, from East Pennard, Somerset, started losing her sight 30 years ago due to glaucoma and cataracts, and was been fully blind for more than 17 years.

Audrey sat in her regular spot in the Screwfix stand at Huish Park with Nigel as her favourite 'Glovers' won . She relied on husband and retired teacher Bob to help her get out, and when he passed away in 1997 Nigel asked her to the football as a way to keep active. Audrey sits in the Screwfix stand at Huish Park with Nigel, 50, and daughter-in-law Lucy, as well as nine-month-old granddaughter Georgiana, who also has a season ticket. The grandmother-of-one, who has been clerk on her parish council for 40 years, is helped up 14 steps to her seat by Nigel and a steward. She has barely missed a game and was in her regular spot on Tuesday night as her favourite 'Glovers' won. Audrey, a former Brownie leader said: 'It was so exciting, it was lovely, but it was a bit nail biting all the way through. 'I kept thinking 'I'm sure they are going to score', wishing we would just score. 'It was half time and it was still nil nil, and then with just six minutes to go I was expecting it to go to penalties. 'Then suddenly there was this great sound from the crowd around me but I didn't know who scored because I couldn't hear my radio - the noise was just so much. 'When Nigel sat down I asked who scored and then I heard it and there was more cheering and it was about five minutes before we did it again.' The cup tie against Man United is on January 4, and Yeovil will pocket £144,000 in TV profits plus a further £67,500 if they knock out Louis Van Gaal's side. 'My daughter-in-law is ringing up for tickets for the Man United game today,' said Audrey. 'I don't know what will happen in that one, it depends what sort of team they send. 'We can only hope - it's just the doing of it. 'Everybody it talking about it now. People have become a lot more interested in it because it is Man United. 'But it is the excitement that I enjoy - and of course there are many disappointments too - and waiting to know what they are doing and how they are getting on.

"President Barack Obama on Wednesday cut short prison time for eight drug convicts and issued pardons to twelve other federal offenders in a move designed to draw attention to his objections to mandatory-minimum drug sentencing. It's unclear whether the White House will issue a broader set of clemency proclamations in Obama last two years in office, but the news came while the nation's attention was focused on a handful of more controversial prisoner releases: the three Cuban spies traded to the Castro regime in exchange for an aging American aid worker who sat behind bars for five years. That move came on the front end of a day-long White House focus on 'normalizing' diplomatic and trade relations between Washington and Havana. The 20 other recipients of presidential clemency went comparatively unnoticed. Obama's commutations were the first issued under new guidelines his administration announced earlier this year designed to cut costs by reducing the nation's bulging prison population. A pardon forgives a crime without erasing the conviction, typically after the sentence has been served. A commutation leaves the conviction in place but ends the punishment earlier than a court has prescribed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? (100 times the prison sentence!) Americans sentenced in the 1980s and 1990s for possession or distribution of crack cocaine (left) often received sentences far out of proportion with those caught using or selling the 'powder' form of the same drug (right) There are 98,082 federal prisoners serving time in facilities like this one in Butner, North Carolina, for drug offenses, according to the Bureau of Prisons. That's 48.7 per cent of all convicts in the federal system . The White House said the eight shortened sentences were in cases where the prisoners would have received a substantially lower sentence if they were punished today, and would have already served their time. Obama has said he wants to show leniency toward nonviolent drug offenders sentenced to double-digit federal prison terms. For example, Barbara Scrivner was sentenced to 30 years in 1995 when she was 27 years old for a minor role in her husband's methamphetamine ring. Obama ordered her sentence to expire June 12; others will expire April 15. Administration officials told the Associated Press that they expect Obama to grant more clemency petitions. The White House says 6,561 people already have applied in the past year, compared to 2,370 the year before. 'I think there is an awareness out there that this president is interested in granting clemency on these kinds of matters,' White House counsel Neil Eggleston told the AP. The clemency policy changes aren't limited to drug offenders, who comprise about half of the roughly 216,000 federal prisoners, but the criteria make it clear they are the main target. To be eligible, inmates must have already been behind bars for at least 10 years, have a nonviolent history, have no other major criminal convictions, have a good behavior record in prison, and be serving a sentence that, if imposed today, would be substantially shorter than what they were given at the time. The old sentencing guidelines subjected tens of thousands of African-Americans in particular to long prison terms for crack cocaine convictions, while saddling those caught with powder cocaine with far more lenient sentences. Those convicts tended to be white. The guidelines were enacted in 1986 when crack cocaine use was rampant and considered a particularly dangerous and violence-related drug. Under that law, a person convicted of possessing five grams of crack cocaine got the same mandatory prison term as someone with 500 grams of powder cocaine. UNNOTICED: Obama's clemency proclamations were buried in the day's other prison-related news – the release of three Cuban spies in exchange for an ailing foreign aid worker imprisoned in Cuba since 2009 . The president signed the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010 to cut penalties for crack cocaine offenses in order to reduce the disparity. But the act addressed only new cases, not old ones. In his first term, Obama commuted just one drug sentence and pardoned 39 people, leading prisoner advocates to accuse him of being too stingy with his power. Obama aides said it was because he wasn't receiving more positive recommendations from the Office of the Pardon Attorney, so he directed the Justice Department to improve its clemency recommendation process and recruit more applications from among current prisoners. The Bureau of Prisons has been notifying inmates of the new criteria, and the Justice Department has asked bar associations around the country to help prepare their petitions. Deputy Attorney General James Cole, who in April announced the clemency policy changes, said in a statement that Wednesday's sentence commutations reflect a 'commitment to bring fairness to our criminal justice system.' 'While all eight were properly held accountable for their criminal actions, their punishments did not fit their crimes, and sentencing laws and policies have since been updated to ensure more fairness for low-level offenders,' he said. The White House noted Obama now has commuted 18 sentences, compared to 11 under President George W. Bush and three in the first six years of the Clinton presidency. Clinton eventually commuted 61, most of them in a controversial action on his last day in office. President Barack Obama on has commuted the sentences of the following eight people convicted of drug crimes: . The president ordered the commuted sentences to expire on April 15, except for Johnson and Scrivner on June 12. Obama granted full pardons to twelve other convicts: .","President picked low-level drug offenders whose sentences would have been shorter if they were punished today .

"As the Sydney siege unfolded in the Lindt cafe, a Channel Seven cameraman was watching it all through his camera lens and providing vital information and vision for police snipers. Veteran cameraman Greg Parker remained in the network's newsroom as his colleagues were all evacuated around him. He was accompanied by a member of the force's crack shooting squad, who asked him to keep filming as authorities assessed the movements of the crazed gunman and his treatment of the 18 hostages. Scroll down for video . The Channel 7 cameras were trained on the windows of the Lindt cafe during the entire ordeal, capturing vital information and harrowing images of the siege . Veteran cameraman Greg Parker worked with a police sniper for more than 16 hours to give the command centre a look inside the cafe where gunman Man Haron Monis took 18 captives . The extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary measures. Usually, in any critical situation, the media would be ushered well away from the scene but this time the two worked hand in hand. What he saw and relayed back to the police command was as harrowing as it was stunning. In an interview with Channel Seven, Parker said: 'One of the hardest things to see was there was three women forced to hold that flag up against the glass, and then another image of a poor guy in obvious distress with the muzzle of a shotgun, you know, in frame being pointed at his head.' 'It was the first time we'd seen a clear threatening pose, that the gun was pointed at a bloke's head who was in a very passive stance up against the glass. As the drama began to unfold, Parker had three cameras pointed across Martin Place into the Lindt cafe, which would provide the closest possible, and clearest, view for authorities. 'I knew we were getting something pretty remarkable in what we could see with our lens on the camera and the sniper concurred and then said could we stay there and keep sweeping and giving him continual information of what we were seeing behind the glass,' Parker said. In an interview with Channel Seven cameraman Greg Parker said: 'One of the hardest things to see was there was three women forced to hold that flag up against the glass, and then another image of a poor guy in obvious distress with the muzzle of a shotgun, you know, in frame being pointed at his head.' The veteran news cameraman saw first hand, the manic behaviour inside the cafe by Monis, his mistreatment of those held captive and their sheer terror . 'It was genuinely horrible, in 20 years, it's very rare to come across such upsetting footage, there's nothing you can do,' Greg Parker said . 'The longer it went on, the lights went off, signs weren't looking good and the scene was sort of getting worse by the hour,' said Greg Parker who assisted police by capturing images inside the cafe throughout the ordeal . 'The guys back in the police command were then asking for specific shots, so we put on Kevlar vests and came down and relocated cameras as they needed them to be. Specifically, that window that they called ""Window 4"", where the flag was being sort of held up, was where the gunman was continually sort of positioning himself and putting hostages between himself and the window and himself and the door,"" he said. He saw first hand, the manic stomping around the cafe by Monis, his mistreatment of those held captive and their sheer terror. 'It was genuinely horrible, in 20 years, it's very rare to come across such upsetting footage, there's nothing you can do,' Parker added. 'For a real long time it was just him (the sniper) and I, I think for five or six hours, making small talk and, you know, to be honest, the situation kept us pretty busy because we were both looking for any opportunity that was going to affect a positive outcome, and then we continually were sort of blown away at just how sad the situation was as it went on and on, we both just were sort of praying that these families, these people were going to get out. 'The longer it went on, the lights went off, signs weren't looking good and the scene was sort of getting worse by the hour.' For someone who has covered countless confronting news stories, this experience shook Parker like no other.

"Russia shoppers have been panic-buying everything from cars to flat pack furniture today after stores warned of price hikes at the weekend following a sharp fall in the value of the rouble. Several Ikea stores have been forced to close after the company warned its prices will go up from tomorrow, while cars and home appliances have been bought in record numbers. The rouble has slid 15 per cent in just two days, hitting an all-time low of 80 to the dollar at one point yesterday, prompting fears of a run on Russian banks. Scroll down for video . Russian shoppers have been panic-buying large items, including cars, TVs, and flat-pack furniture today after stores warned they would put up prices from tomorrow as the value of the rouble took a drastic fall . Ikea was filled with shoppers today, with several branches forced to close after the store announced price hikes starting tomorrow after fear spread through the Russian economy . While Ikea prepars to raise prices, Apple suspended all online sales saying it could not fix prices for iPhones, iPads and other products while the currency is volatile . Lengthy queues formed at Ikea stores as shoppers were keen to take advantage before price rises . Alyona Korsuntseva, a woman in her 30s, says the current situation reminds her of the 1998 crisis when  the value of the rouble plummeted after the government defaulted on sovereign bonds. She said: 'What's pressuring us is the fact that many people rushed to withdraw money from bank cards and accounts. 'We want to safeguard ourselves so that things wouldn't be as bad they were back then.' Pictures from the capital Moscow showed people with trollies filled with televisions, toasters, and furniture ahead of stores putting their prices up, while other waited in long lines at checkouts. But while street shoppers cashed in, some online shoppers were left in the lurch after companies such as Apple suspended sales, saying they could not set prices while the currency was so volatile. The tech company already raised costs by 20 per cent earlier this year after the poor performance of the rouble made its products cheaper in Russia than elsewhere in Europe. Many shops in Russia are reporting record sales today as shoppers rush to buy big-ticket items such as televisions (pictured) ahead of imminent price hikes . The Russian rouble hit an all-time low of 85 to one dollar at one point yesterday, and has since recovered some of its value, but is still 15 per cent down overall . The current economic collapse is reminiscent of the 1998 Russian Crisis in which the value of the rouble tumbled after the government defaulted on its sovereign bonds . Financial crisis has been looming in Russia for a while as trade sanctions over Ukraine, combined with falling oil prices, have put pressure on the economy. Yesterday's meltdown was triggered after the Central Bank put up interest rates from 10.5 per cent to 17 per cent, a move that was meant to shore up the rouble, but instead caused panic. As international investors moved assets elsewhere it caused the value of the currency to plummet. That trend continued this morning, and the currency's value has been up and down throughout the rest of the today. As of 4pm this afternoon, Moscow time, the rouble has settled at around 65 to the dollar, 3 per cent higher than closing yesterday. The upward swing came on the back of Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseyev saying that the government is going to sell foreign currency 'as much as necessary and as long as necessary' to relieve the pressure on the rouble. Shoppers leave department stores in Russia in droves after a panic-buying spree today sparked by warnings of huge price hikes due to start from tomorrow . Low oil prices, along with European and U.S. sanctions over the situation in Ukraine, have put pressure on the Russian stock market, causing panic among international investors . Yesterday's huge falls were sparked after the Russian Central Bank hiked up interest rates to try and restore the rouble's value, but instead it caused panic and sent the currency into free-fall . Shoppers seen snapping up furniture ahead of tomorrow's price rise in Russia because of the fall in the value of the rouble . Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the situation as 'very dangerous' as shoppers panic bought in Ikea . Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev also hosted a meeting with the heads of Russia's largest exporters and pledged to implement a 'package of measures' to stop the decline of the ruble. He said the details of the measures to be pursued will be hammered out at the meeting and these will be only 'market steps.' 'This is a very dangerous situation, we are just a few days away from a full-blown run on the banks,' Russia's leading business daily Vedomosti said in an editorial on Wednesday. 'If one does not calm down the currency market right now, the banking system will need robust emergency care.' As Russia's Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev said the hike in interest rates came too late, forecaster predicted the country's economy would shrink by up to 5 per cent next year. The dire predictions come as Barack Obama prepares to sign a new set of legislation authorizing more economic sanctions on Russia. The panic comes ahead of Barack Obama singing yet more economic sanctions into law, meaning Putin faces one of the largest ever challenges to his leadership .","Shoppers panic buying ahead of huge price rises due to start tomorrow .

"A school bus driver in Kansas City, Missouri, punished a blind 8-year-old boy for misbehaving by taking away his walking stick and replacing it with a soft pool noodle earlier this week. Rachel and Dakota Nafzinger say their son, Dakota, was left humiliated when the school staffer handed him the floppy, lime-green toy on his way from Gracemor Elementary School Monday. Dakota suffers from a rare medical condition called bilateral anopthalmia and was born without eyes. Scroll down for video . Special needs: Dakota Nafzinger (left and right), 8, from Missouri, was born without eyes and has been relying on a cane to get around . Cruel punishment: Earlier this week, a school bus driver punished Dakota for misbehaving by replacing his cane with a floppy pool noodle (pictured) Bus incident: The student was on his way home from Gracemor Elementary School in Kansas City Monday when he allegedly used his cane to hit someone . Despite his affliction, the 8-year-old enjoys singing, swimming and fishing, but he relies on a cane to get around. ‘Why would you do that? Why would you take the one thing that he’s supposed to use all the time? That’s his eyes,' his mother told Fox4KC. North Kansas City School District Spokeswoman Michelle Cronk said Dakota's walking stick was school property that was given to him when he entered the school, and that it was taken away from him Monday after he struck someone with it while riding the bus. The school district representative said that the driver handed Dakota the pool toy as a substitute because the boy tends to fidget unless he has something in his hands. The 8-year-old said he was told by school officials that he will have to rely on the Styrofoam tube for the next two weeks, but according to the child, it is of no use to him and makes it much harder for him to feel his way when walking. Misunderstanding: Dakota's father, Donald (left), said his son has a tendency to lift his walking stick (right) - a gesture which may have been misinterpreted as an act of aggression . Rachel Nafzinger, pictured, said she does not understand why anyone would take away the one thing her son needs to function . Rachel Nafzinger, the boy's mother, said she does not understand why school officials chose to punish her special-needs son by depriving him of the one thing he needs most in his day-to-day life. ‘He’s gone through so much in his life already… and I just don’t like someone else putting my son in that position,’ she said. Donald Nafzinger has suggested that perhaps Dakota lifted his cane in the air, as he often does, and the driver mistook it for an act of aggression. On Wednesday, the North Kansas City School District released a statement saying that an internal investigation has determined that a ‘mistake’ was made Monday. The district has since apologized to the Nafzinger family.","Dakota Nafzinger was handed the lime-green toy Monday after allegedly using his cane to hit someone .

"Tottenham striker Harry Kane deserves an England call-up to Roy Hodgson's senior squad, according to Clive Allen. Kane has been in impressive form for Tottenham since the start of the season, scoring 12 goals in 21 games for the north London outfit. And former Tottenham forward Allen believes he is ready to join the likes of Wayne Rooney, Gary Cahill and Joe Hart in the Three Lions' senior set up. Tottenham striker Harry Kane deserves a call-up to Roy Hodgson's England side, insists Clive Allen . Kane scored Tottenham's third goal in their 4-0 Capital One Cup win against Newcastle . Allen, speaking to talkSPORT, said: 'He is doing everything he is capable of. Seeing him come in as a kid, you could see he had talent. 'He has got a magnificent attitude and there is no problem in terms of keeping his feet on the ground because he was really focused from a young age. 'He wasn’t overconfident, he worked really hard at his game, and he was able to deal with every level he played at. It is great to see a young English striker scoring goals in the Premier League. Harry is single-minded in the right way and I think it is fantastic. 'People are starting to talk about him making the England side. That would be a meteoric rise and it would be nothing more than he deserved because he has worked hard to get to where he is.' Kane has scored eight goals in 10 games for England's Under 21 side.

"The environmental group Greenpeace has not given Peru the names of the activists accused of damaging the world-renowned Nazca lines  during a publicity stunt, Peruvian officials claim. The government has threatened extradition for the activists involved and said it would seek charges for 'attacking archaeological monuments' - a crime punishable by up to six years in prison. During a protest at the U.N. World Heritage site in Peru's coastal desert, activists laid a message promoting clean energy beside the famed figure of a hummingbird comprised of black rocks on a white background. Scroll down for video . The Greenpeace stunt (pictured) backfired, with Peruvian officials now saying they may seek charges and extradition against those involved for 'attacking archeological monuments' The message was directed at delegates at the U.N. climate talks being held in nearby Lima. Culture Minister Diana Alvarez-Calderon said Monday that Peru 'hasn't obtained what it would have liked to obtain: names, passports, addresses' of the activists involved. He added: 'What Greenpeace's representative says is that they want to conduct an investigation that will last about a month because they are going to look into 27 affiliates. They want to know who produced the idea for the event, who organized it and who went to it.' Attempts to reach Greenpeace for comment were not successful, but the organisation has previously apologised for the stunt and said it was willing to accept the consequences. The activists entered a 'strictly prohibited' area where they laid big yellow cloth letters reading: 'Time for Change; The Future is Renewable.' They said after initial criticism that they were 'absolutely careful' not to disturb anything. Greenpeace spokesman Mike Townsley said the organisation was conducting an internal review, the New York Times reported. He said: 'Everyone who was involved will be approached and asked to account for their role. Until we have carried out a proper investigation we cannot comment on any individuals.' Peruvian officials say that no one, not even presidents and cabinet ministers, is allowed without authorisation where the activists trod, and those who do have permission must wear special shoes. The Nazca lines are huge figures depicting living creatures, stylized plants and imaginary figures scratched on the surface of the ground between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago. They are believed to have had ritual astronomical functions. Activists work on the message, which was laid out next to an ancient geoglyph in Nazca, Peru . Greenpeace has since apologised for the stunt and said it was deeply concerned about any 'moral offence' Activists walk towards the site in Peru. The message was left on a protected UNESCO world heritage site . The message, on a protected UNESCO world heritage site, . aimed to pressure negotiators at a United Nations climate change . summit in Lima that ended on Sunday.

The Nazca Lines are striking reminders of Peru's rich . pre-Hispanic past and inspired the Andean country's logo. Last week a Peruvian judge rejected prosecutors' request to . keep the activists in the country to face questioning, citing . incomplete information. But Alvarez-Calderon said authorities will keep trying to . hold accountable the dozen activists involved in the action. 'The damage caused is irreparable,' Alvarez-Calderon said at . a news conference. 'We have to continue the process when a . person is not in Peru - extradition if the judge decides so or . civil reparation.' The geoglyph designs at the site include this huge outline of a bird, known as The Condor . Pictured from the air is another of the geoglyphs at the expansive desert - it is called The Astronaut . Greenpeace apologized for the stunt last week and said it . would take responsibility for the consequences of its actions. Activists from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Spain, Germany, . Italy and Austria took part. 'They created a line that wasn't there before,' said Deputy . Culture Minister Luis Jaime Castillo.

Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock (above) has confirmed his interest in former England star Ashley Cole. However, it looks as if Cole is not yet ready to call time on his Italian adventure. Despite losing his place in the team to Jose Holebas, Cole is confident of regaining his place back. He is said to be enjoying his time in Italy and being away from the intense spotlight in England. Nevertheless, Palace remain interested in striking a deal for Cole should his situation change next month.

"Jams: Friday afternoon is set to be the busiest time on the roads for the entire Christmas period . Journey times on some major roads could more than treble as motorists start the great Friday Christmas getaway, experts have revealed. Traffic specialists INRIX said tomorrow afternoon from 4pm will be the busiest time over Christmas, with up to 20million cars on the road. They are blaming a toxic combination of the usual Friday peak with the start of the school holidays and early Christmas break-ups for some workers. INRIX said other busy days will include next Tuesday and December 27. Major motorways including the M1, the M25 and the M6 are expected to be the worst affected. The M25’s anti-clockwise stretch between junction 23 and junction 10 is predicted to take around two hours and 20 minutes - compared to a normal 40-minute journey time. The road with a 70mph limit will see speeds drop to just 18mph, said the INRIX report. Despite extra lanes now in play, it adds to the M25’s reputation as ‘the biggest car park in Europe’ Drivers on a 60-mile section of the M1 northbound between junction 21 and junction 32 will see an hour-long journey soar to 2 hours and 25 minutes, more than double the usual time. Fifteen-minute journeys are set to almost quadruple to 55 minutes on the M56 eastbound at junction 9 and the M5 northbound at junction 3, with average speeds falling to just 14mph. One of the busiest ‘pinch-point’ exit routes out of London will also suffer jams. The already busy 14.5 mile stretch of the A4 westbound from Hyde Park corner to Heathrow Airport will take more than twice as long as normal to drive, increasing from 35 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes, said the report. In northern England the 17-mile A1 northbound stretch through Newcastle-upon-Tyne will see journey times more than double from 20 minutes to 45 minutes, with speeds reduced to 22mph. There is a normal quieter period over Christmas Day and Boxing Day, with traffic picking up again on Saturday, December 27 as drivers head home after spending Christmas away, return to work or go shopping. Pinch points: The ten worst spots on the roads, according to the report today by traffic specialists INRIX . Meanwhile rail passengers also face Christmas chaos over the busy festive holiday period - and are even being advised not to use a key London to Scotland main line. Engineering works will cause closures, delays, disruption and bus replacements. Much of the £200million upgrades by 11,000 engineers are being performed on Christmas Day and Boxing Day, but delays will hit commuters throughout the festive period. Repair work on the West Coast main line means it will be shut between Euston station in London and Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire after the last trains on Christmas Eve until Monday, December 29. It will also be closed between Stafford and Crewe after the last trains on Christmas Eve until Sunday 28 December. Rail bosses say the now almost traditional Christmas repair closures are vital as work continues on ‘improvements’ in the Watford area and between Stafford and Crewe. To minimise disruption Network Rail and the Virgin Trains and London Midland train companies are advising passengers to avoid the West Coast main line and use alternative routes. But passenger groups say this is little comfort for those who have to endure the disruption en route to visiting friends and family. The M4 will be the worst affected, with 34 scheduled works, followed by motorways - M1,  M25, M6 and M5 . Heathrow will get off no more lightly, handling almost 700,000 passengers leaving from the west London airport between tomorrow and Christmas Day. Of those, 116,700 will travel tomorrow. Gatwick will handle 800,000 departures between tomorrow and January 3, with Stansted Airport in Essex handling 430,000. In addition around 380,000 will leave from Manchester and 160,000 from Birmingham. Hundreds of thousands of people will also travel across the English Channel by ferry or through the Channel Tunnel, with 250,000 heading off on the high-speed trains of Eurostar. Greg Hallsworth, lead scientist and traffic analyst at INRIX, said: ‘Drivers would be well advised to steer clear of driving in the afternoon of Friday December 19 as this will be the busiest period on the roads this Christmas. 'There will be significant delays between 12pm and 6pm caused by a combination of the usual Friday evening post-work peak, the start of English school holidays and people driving home for Christmas. ‘Where possible, drivers should look for alternative routes to avoid the busiest roads, and travel outside of peak times. 'It’s worth bearing in mind that the shortest route isn’t necessarily the quickest and that drivers’ normal routes may be worse hit by Christmas traffic than other roads. 'Adverse weather can also have a significant impact on congestion, so check the forecast when planning a trip and try to avoid wet or especially cold periods.’","Major motorways including M1, M25 and M6 set to be worst affected .

"The parents of a four-month old baby found dead with traces of amphetamine in her system were spared an immediate jail sentence today after a judge heard they were 'consumed by guilt'. Kiera Johnson died unexpectedly in the night while sleeping in her parents' bed in Washington, Tyne and Wear, last September. Her parents Cheryl Lauderdale, 32, and Michael Johnson, 24, admitted cruelty charges on the basis the baby was exposed to amphetamine in the home she was growing up in. Parents: Cheryl Lauderdale (left) and Michael Johnson (right), the parents of a four-month old baby found dead with traces of amphetamine in her system were spared an immediate jail sentence today . Newcastle Crown Court was told that Lauderdale and Johnson, who are no longer together, were 'recreational users' of the class B drug. Prosecutors accept Kiera was not deliberately fed the drug and it did not cause or contribute towards her untimely death. It remains unclear why the little girl died. Today Lauderdale and Johnson were handed suspended prison terms after a judge at Newcastle Crown Court said they were 'consumed by guilt' over their daughter’s death, which had not been their fault. The court heard Kiera was born in May last year and she died on September 5. Drug use: Newcastle Crown Court was told that Lauderdale and Johnson, who are no longer together, were 'recreational users' of the class B drug . Prosecutor Christopher Rose said: 'Traces of amphetamine were found in Kiera’s system following her death. 'The crown’s case is not that the presence of amphetamine in Kiera’s system contributed to her death. 'Her cause of death remains unascertained.' Mr Rose said it was 'reckless' behaviour by the parents that led to the baby’s ingestion of the drug, which was a small amount, and she was not deliberately fed it. Anne Richardson, defending Lauderdale, said: 'Whatever sentence the court passes will not bring her daughter back nor lessen the responsibility she feels.' Johnson's barrister Glen Gatland said he was 'totally devastated; by the death of his daughter and puts himself through punishment daily because of it. The court heard both parents have suffered cruel taunts because of what happened to their baby. Judge John Milford QC told them: 'You have lost your child, you have suffered that appalling bereavement that no parent should suffer. 'You are both, I am satisfied, consumed with guilt. 'You have both had to suffer hostile reaction of the communities in which you live, where others will see you as being responsible for the death when you are not. 'I think, because of the suffering you have both undergone, justice demands I suspend the sentences on you and I will.' The judge issued a warning to other parents about drug use around children. Sentencing: Judge John Milford, sitting at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) issued a warning to other parents about drug use around children as he sentenced Lauderdale and Johnson . He added: 'Those who have care of children, be it parents or otherwise, who use within their homes controlled drugs, expose those children to two risks. 'The first risk is that the children will be physically harmed by coming into accidental contact with those drugs. 'The second, and probably the more likely cause of harm is that those children, when they are of an age to appreciate what is going on around them, will come to believe the smoking of cannabis, taking of amphetamine, injecting of heroin or whatever is a social norm and that their own lives will be adversely effected as a result' Lauderdale, of Donwell, Washington, and Johnson, of Albany, Washington, both admitted child cruelty and possession of amphetamine, which was found in the house after the death. Judge Milford sentenced them both to six months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with supervision and Johnson was also given a three month night time curfew.","Kiera Johnson died unexpectedly while sleeping in her parents' bed .

"A wannabe police office has undergone surgery to reduce the size of her 32GG breasts in the hope that it will increase her chances of getting her dream job. Former model Hannah Sadowska, 33, paid £3,700 to increase her chest from a B-cup in 2007 after an eating disorder left her 'flat-chested'. However, the mother of one, from Wrexham, Wales, found that her huge cleavage was a barrier to being taken seriously in the business world, and in October she had them reduced to a D-cup. Hannah paid for a second surgery on her breasts to remove her implants, taking her from a 32GG (left) to a D and is now confident in pursuing her dream of becoming a police officer . Last week, glamour model Price revealed she'd had her breasts reduced from a 32FF (left) to a C-cup (right) Hannah says she wants to warn other women against making the same 'mistake that Katie Price and I did'. Last week, glamour model Price revealed she'd had her breasts reduced by five sizes to a C-cup. She has had seven boob jobs in total, at her biggest she was a 32FF. Hannah said: 'When I heard that Katie Price has had a breast reduction too, I wasn't surprised - I know exactly what it feels like when no one can see past your boobs. Hannah (pictured left) always felt self-conscious about her chest after teenage battle with bulimia . 'Now I want to warn other girls not to make the same mistake that Katie and I did. Buy a nice new car or treat yourself to a holiday, but don't waste thousands on massive new breasts.' Hannah is now applying for a job in the police force, and is currently studying for a criminology degree at Glyndwr University. She said: 'I could never have wrestled a criminal to the ground with my implants - they were far too large for my frame. I want to be taken seriously, not look like a stripper in a fancy dress copper's outfit.' Hannah said she always felt self-conscious about her chest after teenage battle with bulimia shrank her breasts from a C-cup to a B-cup. 'I was really chubby when I was 13 and I got really badly bullied for it - which turned me bulimic,' she explained. 'Over a period of eight months, I went from 13 stone to seven stone and my chest never developed. 'Even when I managed to put weight back on my breasts never grew. I resorted to stuffing my bra with tissues and chicken filets. 'I was really self-conscious, I never took my top off in front of a man and never wore vests.' Hannah said she always dreamed of having a glamour model's body, with a bra size to match. In 2007, she took out a £7,000 loan and used more than half of it to pay for a boob job. She said: 'As I went under I said to the surgeon ""make my breasts as big as you possibly can - even if I die"". 'I'd gone through years of bullying so to wake up from surgery with a pair of Katie Price breasts felt incredible. Hannah's huge bust meant that despite running her own business and studying for a degree she struggled to be taken seriously and said people made assumptions about her based on her appearance . Hannah also suffered scarring from where her uncomfortably large breasts had rubbed against her bra . 'It took me hours to get up as they were very heavy. I had to get used to carrying all this extra weight around in front of me.' Busty Hannah embarked on a career as a model and launched her own business designing and selling supportive sports bras for women who have undergone breast enlargement surgery. In 2008, she gave birth to her son Alexander, now six. But, struggling to be taken seriously in the business world, Hannah decided her large bust had to go. She said: 'When I walked into a room everyone just saw my boobs and not me. 'People always assumed I was going out every night and would sleep with anyone - that could not be further from the truth. I was a mum, studying for a university degree while running my own business - but I looked like a stripper. In October Hannah Sadowska had a private operation to reduce her breasts by four cup sizes . 'I also had some really horrible scarring where from where my uncomfortably large breasts had rubbed against my bra. 'I brought it upon myself. I wanted the glamour girl look and I got it. But it had a negative impact on my health and my life.' In October this year, Hannah had a private operation to reduce her breasts by four cup sizes. She said: 'I feel like a different girl - I feel calm, content and quiet. I'm a lot more together, now when I walk into a room I know people are looking at me and not my chest.' Hannah has now has taken the entrance exam for a job in the police force - she has been to an interview and passed the medical examination. She said: 'If I didn't change my look then no one would take me seriously as a police officer. 'But it isn't just the way I look, it is a very physically demanding job. My giant breasts would put me and my colleagues at risk as I would not be able to fulfil my role as a police officer. 'Once I pass my degree I will hopefully be accepted to the job and now I also have the look to go with it.'","A teenage battle with bulimia shrank Hannah Sadowska's bust size .

"President Barack Obama will sign legislation imposing new economic sanctions on Russia, as the U.S. claims some credit for sparking Moscow's roiling currency crisis and moves to deepen the pain. The Russian economy has been in a downward spiral for months, but President Vladimir Putin has managed to maintain political support at home. However, White House officials acknowledged there were no guarantees Russia's economic woes and another round of sanctions would compel Putin to curtail aggressive actions in Ukraine. It comes as German Chancellor Angela Merkel pursues a policy of engagement and has spoken with Putin how he could go about imposing a comprehensive ceasefire in war torn Ukraine. Following President Obama's (pictured) decision to sign-off the bill, a White House spokesman said it was hoped the latest round of sanctions would 'sharpen the choices' Putin faces in Ukraine . 'The aim is to sharpen the choice he faces,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said of the sanctions. He said Obama was likely to sign the bill this week after the measure cleared Congress late Saturday. Obama's support came as the Russian ruble continued its precipitous fall. The impact of the Western sanctions has been compounded by plummeting oil prices, leading Russia's Central Bank to announce a massive middle-of-the-night interest rate increase Tuesday in an unsuccessful bid to stabilize the currency. Obama economic adviser Jason Furman said Russia was grappling with a crisis of its own making. 'The combination of our sanctions, the uncertainty they've created for themselves with their international actions and the falling price of oil has put their economy on the brink of crisis,' Mr Furman said. 'That gives you only bad choices.' Mr Earnest said the president had concerns about the measure but felt it gave him 'flexibility' in carrying out lawmakers' stipulations. The legislation includes a waiver allowing Obama to forgo the penalties if doing so was in U.S. national security interests. Administration officials wouldn't say whether Obama planned to exercise the waiver. The legislation has widespread bipartisan support on Capitol Hill but has worried Europe, where leaders fear unilateral U.S. action will undermine the West's united front against Moscow. President Obama will sign the legislation following its approval in Congress on Saturday. File image used . For months, the U.S. and European Union have sought to enact sanctions against Russia in tandem. But Europe, which has a far more extensive economic relationship with Russia than does the U.S., has largely reached its limit for enacting broad sanctions against the Russian energy industry and other key economic sectors unless the Kremlin ramps up its actions in Ukraine. However, in an apparent attempt to maintain some Western unity as Obama signs the legislation, a Western diplomat said the U.S. and EU were preparing similar packages of trade and investment bans in Crimea, the strategically important peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine earlier this year. Those penalties could be announced in the coming days, according to the diplomat, who was not authorized to discuss the pending action publicly and insisted on anonymity. Following the takeover of Crimea, Kremlin-backed rebels began occupying cities in eastern Ukraine, near Russia's border. The West has accused Russia of supplying and supporting the rebels. Ukrainian officials have been pressing the U.S. to supply its military with weapons and ammunition to fight the Russian-backed forces. Obama has resisted those requests because he fears lethal assistance would antagonize Russia and perhaps spur Moscow to launch a full-scale invasion. The legislation gives the president the authority to send Ukraine anti-tank weapons, counter-artillery radar and tactical surveillance drones. Administration officials said Obama was not expected to act on that authority. German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) has called Putin (right) to discuss steps for a ceasefire in Ukraine . The bill does require the president to impose penalties on state-owned arms dealer Rosoboronexport and other Russian defense companies tied to unrest in Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and Syria, unless the president invokes his waiver authority. The sanctions would be extended to people and entities helping the companies. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called Putin to discuss possible steps to secure a comprehensive cease-fire in eastern Ukraine. The call late Tuesday came as Russia grappled with a sudden drop in its currency, the ruble. Moscow has accused the West of trying to inflict economic pain on Russia for political ends. Merkel's office said Wednesday that the two leaders were joined by French President Francois Hollande and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in the discussion. It said they agreed on the need for increased humanitarian aid, including by Ukraine, to separatist-controlled parts of the east.","President Obama will sign legislation imposing new sanctions on Russia .

"Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett is braced for bid from Premier League clubs for teen talent Demarai Gray once the January transfer window opens – but insists there is no financial pressure to sell. Gray, 18, announced himself in the Championship with a hat-trick against Reading last Saturday and is in talks with his club over a new two-year deal. His current contract has 18 months to run. Rowett believes Birmingham is the best place for the winger’s development, with Liverpool, Tottenham and Crystal Palace monitoring his situation. Palace had a £500,000 bid for Gray rejected in the summer and the Blues manager says it would take a large offer to force even consideration. Demarai Gray (right) celebrates smashing a hat-trick against Reading on Saturday . Gray (left) is attracting interest from several Premier League clubs but has been urged to stay at Birmingham . ‘He’s as good as any young player I’ve seen at this age,’ said Rowett. ‘At 18 years old, the ability to score a hat-trick at Championship level doesn’t happen very often. He’s an exciting player. He gets the fans off the edge of their seats. ‘I’m realistic, I would expect some interest in January and I would expect that interest to be very strong from top clubs, because he is a top player. ‘But also you have to look at that he’s playing regular football in the Championship. Sometimes for a young player it’s just as important to get 100 starts than go to a bigger club and sit on the bench or play in Under 21 squads. Gray (left) seals his hat-trick against Reading with a neat finish on Saturday . ‘What he’s shown is we shouldn’t be looking to sell him for a low fee just to fit his ambitions. The club has a real potential star player on its hands. ‘We obviously have to manage him, manage his expectations, manage what he does on the pitch because he’s got a lot to learn still. I would expect if someone does want to buy him he’s not going to come. There are not many young British players around who can go past people, are quick, and can score goals.’ Sky Bet are the Title Sponsor of The Football League.

"Raheem Sterling headed in Liverpool's opener in their 3-1 Capital One Cup quarter-final victory over Bournemouth on Wednesday to cap off a remarkable 51-pass move. The Reds kept possession for two-and-a-half minutes during the passage of play leading up to Sterling's exquisite team goal. Inspired by Sterling's strike, here Sportsmail takes a look at the five best-ever team goals... Raheem Sterling (centre) celebrates after scoring the opening goal against Bournemouth on Wednesday . Sterling (right) makes no mistake as he scores the opener for Liverpool in the Capital One Cup clash . This graphic from the MailOnline Sport Match Zone shows the remarkable build-up to Sterling's goal . ESTEBAN CAMBIASSO (ARGENTINA vs Serbia and Montenegro, 2006 World Cup Group Stage) This goal showed Argentina at their very beautiful best. After winning their first game of the World Cup in Germany against Ivory Coast, Argentina would have been confident heading into the game against the highly-rated Serbia and Montenegro. And that confidence almost came across as arrogance when defensive midfielder Esteban Cambiasso slotted home to finish off a 25-pass move. Sometimes 'tiki-taka' style goals involve passing just for the very sake of it, but not this one. Argentina started with the ball in their own half before gradually building up the play with some slick one-touch passes. Eventually they made their way into the Serbia box and, after a neat backheel into his path, Cambiasso smashed home from 15 yards. Esteban Cambiasso (left) celebrates after scoring for Argentina against Serbia and Montenegro in 2006 . The defensive midfielder finished off a 25-pass move which cut open the Serbia defence . CARLOS ALBERTO (BRAZIL vs Italy, 1970 World Cup Final) The samba stars of the seventies are widely regarded as one of the best teams of all time, blessed with the likes of Pele and Rivelino, and this goal encapsulates everything that was so majestic about them. After missing out on the World Cup in England in 1966, Brazil were back with a bang in Mexico, led out by marauding right back Carlos Alberto. The captain scored the clincher in a 4-1 victory over Italy at the iconic Azteca Stadium, firing home a low drive into the bottom corner from the right-hand side. Brazil toyed with the Italians, with a total of eight of their outfield players passing the ball - Tostao, Brito, Clodoaldo, Pele, Gerson, Rivelino, Jairzinho and Alberto - before the captain hammered home to seal the World Cup. Clodoaldo even had time to jink inside and outside of four Italians before continuing the move. Alberto's finish followed a magnificent ball down the right-hand side from Pele after Tostao pointed out that Alberto was advancing at some speed. Simply unbelievable.

JACK WILSHERE (ARSENAL vs Norwich City, Premier League 2013/14) This goal wowed Arsenal fans and neutrals alike last season as the Gunners cut through the Norwich City defence before Wilshere finished exquisitely. The intricate passing and fancy flicks between Santi Cazorla, Olivier Giroud and England midfielder Wilshere were simply sublime to watch. I implore you to watch this goal and not gasp if you have not seen it before, such is the beauty and precision of the move. The outrageous move sliced apart a Norwich defence who just watched in awe as Arsenal showed what their neat passing can actually achieve at its very best. Wilshere then calmly slotted home to cap off a magnificent team goal. Jack Wilshere sticks his thumb in his mouth as he celebrates scoring for Arsenal against Norwich City . Olivier Giroud (left) hugs Wilshere as they celkebrate in the corner after a brilliant team goal . MARK DAVIES (BOLTON  vs Blackpool, Premier League 2010/11) Unfortunately this is not the sort of goal you would associate with Bolton nowadays, but at the time under Owen Coyle they were flying high and sat fifth in the Premier League. The confidence was clearly flowing through the veins as they faced Blackpool in this match. Despite going two goals down, Wanderers were not to be denied and, having already pulled one back, the team put together a brilliant move to force an equaliser. With just a minute remaining, Kevin Davies slotted the ball through to Johan Elmander who was running away from goal. The big striker then backheeled the ball to Ivan Klasnic, who helped it on into the path of Mark Davies to hit home. Lovely.

ANDRES INIESTA (BARCELONA vs Celtic, Champions League Group Stage 2012/13) There is an almost endless list of Barcelona goals which you could choose from but we had to narrow it down to just one from the tiki-taka masters. But this goal, finished off by Spaniard Iniesta, is sublime and shows everything that Barcelona are about when they are at their very best. The Catalan giants were 1-0 down at the Nou Camp approaching half-time against Celtic but produced one of their most-exquisite passing triangles on the edge of the box. Having kept possession for more than 20 seconds, suddenly the ball found its way to Lionel Messi who surged across the edge of the box at pace. He fed Iniesta who, in order to complete Barca's holy trio, played in Xavi. His pass-master team-mate then returned the ball to Iniesta before the latter finished into the bottom corner.

"A group of axe-wielding women are making a name for themselves in the world of competitive wood chopping. Axe Women founder, Alissa Harper, recruited a Zumba dance instructor, a massage therapist and a grandmother of two to compete in competitions and shows around America. Their shows include axe throwing, underhand chopping, log rolling, and sawing through 19 inches of pine wood. Scroll down for video . From left, Chelsey Black, Tracie Henning, Alissa Harper and Andrea Robarge have taken the world of competitive wood chopping by storm . Ordinarily Chelsey Black is a massage therapist, but in her spare time she likes nothing more than to chop through large logs . Alissa Harper, pictured, founded her group The Axe Women to counter the belief that all lumberjacks are just big, burly men . Ms Harper, 34, said: 'People think lumberjacks are just big, burly men - but they're surprised when we get out of the truck and all my girls are beautiful and feminine. 'All my ladies compete at the World Championships, and that's where I choose my members from.' She started the group five years ago after working for a lumberjack show near her home in Maine, USA. She said: 'I just bought all the equipment and the truck and got some sponsors - now I have more work than I know what to do with.' The Axe Women come from different backgrounds, but all share a passion for the rugged sport. Ms Harper, pictured, said she was inspired to create her group after attending a lumberjack show near her home in Maine five years ago . Zumba dance instructor Tracie Henning, pictured, recently beat the world record for sawing through pine wood in just 21.99 seconds . Grandmother of two Andrea Robarge, 45, from New York,  said her husband and children are all fans of the competitive jumberjacking . Member Tracie Henning, 34, from New York, said: 'I could have my girly side when I shake my hips and dance, but then I also have this side of me where I can get dirty and chop and saw. 'I'm a zumba dance instructor, but being a member of Axe Women is my alter ego - I can walk around and be a badass with an axe, and then I can go and get my nails done and tan. 'I recently broke a world record for sawing through pine wood in 21.99 seconds, and it felt amazing.' Like most members of the team, massage therapist Chelsey Black, 24, was first introduced to the sport in college. Ms Black, from New York, said: 'I don't really fit the standards of what someone expects a lumberjack to look like - they say I look like a Barbie doll. 'I have callouses on my hands from lifting weights and lumberjack sports, but it makes me stronger which is great because I can do deep tissue massages. 'People look for a male to do those deep massages but I can put a lot of pressure down. 'It's a nice conversation starter if I have male clients because we can talk about chainsaws - it makes me more approachable and down-to-earth.' The four women have all competed competitively at the lumberjack world championships and travel around performing demonstrations . For grandmother-of-two, Andrea Robarge, from New York, timber sports is a family affair. Mrs Robarge, 45, said: 'My husband and children do it - we are the lumberjack family. 'Not many people can say they're a lumberjack grandma at my age - but it's when we spend our family time together.' And while the ladies practice with their sharp tools, accidents sometimes happen. She added: 'I've had to have surgery because I've cut my hand with a cross-cut saw, and I've had to have my thumb sewed back together.' The Axe Women hope to encourage other ladies who share a similar passion for timber sports. 'I've been doing this for about 27 years and I've seen so many people come and go. I'm hoping in the future there will be a lot more women in the sport.' On an average day Chelsey Black, pictured, is a massage therapist in Rochester, New York City before going out into the woods .

"A betting firm was offering odds of 10-1 that Her Majesty would announce her decision to step down during her address to the nation . Leading bookmaker Coral has suspended betting on the Queen announcing her abdication in her speech on Christmas Day, following a rush of bets this afternoon. The firm was offering odds of 10-1 that Her Majesty would announce her decision to step down during her address to the nation, but today's unusual gambling has instantly set alarm bells ringing, forcing Coral to close the market altogether. 'Throughout the year there has been major speculation about the Queen's future but today's gamble has really caught us by surprise,' said Coral's Nicola McGeady. 'As far as we are concerned there's no smoke without fire when bets like this come through all in succession, so we have decided to be safe rather than sorry and pull the plug on the market,' added McGeady. A Palace spokesperson said they would not comment, but did highlight the pledges made by the Queen in her 21st birthday speech in 1947. The young Royal said: 'I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.' In her June 1953 Coronation Day speech, she also said: 'I have in sincerity pledged myself to your service, as so many of you are pledged to mine. Scroll down for video . 'Throughout all my life and with all my heart I shall strive to be worthy of your trust.'

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive for the Queen's Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace today . Prince Charles and Prince Harry arrive at Buckingham Palace. The meal is a royal tradition . In contrast, Prince Charles has been heir to the Throne for all but three of his 65 years. When Spanish King Juan Carlos of Spain announced his abdication, many Royal observers wondered if the Queen follow his example. Juan Carlos, 76, is reported to have told courtiers that he stepped down because he wanted to hand over the throne while his son and heir, Crown Prince Felipe, 46, was still a young man to stop him ‘withering’ like Charles. The Queen's annual pre-Christmas lunch took place today at Buckingham Palace, attended by senior royals like Prince Charles, Princes William and Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge. The meal is a royal tradition and allows her to catch up with more distant relations, who are not invited to join her at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk on the 25th. Last year John Prescott has come under fire for suggesting the Queen should abdicate because of a bout of ill-health. The former deputy prime minister said he wanted to pass on concerns that the 86-year-old monarch was 'overburdening' herself.","Bookmaker stopped taking bets of 10-1 that Her Majesty would step down .

The 28-year-old had surgery on Wednesday on his right ankle, which was broken in two places, and was pictured smiling with girlfriend Fran Sanderson.

AMIR KHAN: Really sorry to hear the news about @ant_crolla hope you get well soon mate . TONY BELLEW: My heart goes out to him! The nicest kid in boxing full stop! 'He just went out and did what you’d expect any human being to do,' Sanderson told the Manchester Evening News. 'I shouted for him not to go chasing them, but his instinct kicked in. He ran off and did what was right. I’m very proud and just relieved that he’s still with us – I’m just glad he’s still alive.' Crolla's trainer Joe Gallagher told Sportsmail: ‘He is devastated, absolutely heartbroken, but he’s trying to put a brave face on it. Ant is such a lovely lad and was trying to help a neighbour. He was getting ready for the biggest night of his career but all that is up in the air now. ‘I am just relieved he is alive. This could have been far worse when you think what happened. He is in a bad way but he is lucky to be alive. It’s too early to know what effect this will have on his career and to be honest I don’t want him thinking about it.’ Crolla, who was due to challenge Richar Abril for the WBA lightweight world title on January 23, said late on Wednesday: 'I am absolutely amazed at the amount of support. I’ve been taken aback with the amount of goodwill from fans and friends. 'I feel blessed to have this amount of support. I was only doing what any normal person would do in protecting my neighbour’s property. 'Despite everything, I’m determined to fulfil my dream, and come back to become a world champion in 2015.' Unfortunately it is not the first attack on a boxer in 2014. Kell Brook was stabbed while on holiday earlier this year. The grim details of the attack on Crolla were that he was at home in Chadderton, Greater Manchester, when he heard the burglar alarm sounding from next door. Crolla lands a punch on John Murray on his way to victory over his close friend in Manchester this year . After a phone call went unanswered, Crolla is believed to have spotted through a window that his neighbour’s patio door had been caved in. Crolla is understood to have shouted at the intruders, who fled. The 5ft 8in boxer chased and caught one, but the other is alleged to have hit him over the head with a slab of concrete. ‘Had it been at a slightly different angle then Anthony might have been killed,’ Gallagher added. ‘When he was hit he fell and broke his ankle. He has a deep cut down his head from his hairline to eyebrow. He’s had stitches and he had surgery on his ankle and they’ve had to put pins in.’ Craig Townsend, whose house was being burgled, said: ‘I texted him last night to thank him and say sorry for everything. He replied saying, “Don’t worry about it, we’re neighbours, we look after each other”. His attitude says everything about him, he’s just a great guy.’ Crolla's fight with Abril has been postponed and his promoter, Eddie Hearn, is in talks to rearrange the bout. But it is not yet known whether the fighter will be able to return to the ring. Gallagher, who was with Crolla in hospital in Oldham, said: ‘He is devastated, obviously. This guy was about to fight for a world title. At the moment that’s not important, all that matters is his health. Crolla was due to fight Richar Abril for the WBA lightweight title next month but that has been shelved . ‘But we’ve been joking as well. I was asking him, “Who do you think you are, Batman? Did you think you were going to put them both in headlocks and frogmarch them to the police station?”. ‘This wasn’t his house, but it shows the kind of guy he is that he was trying to help a neighbour.’ Hearn said: ‘Unfortunately the January 23 fight is off but our concerns right now are with Ant and his family. ‘I have spoken to Richar Abril’s team and we are trying to reschedule the fight.’ Detective Sergeant Richard Arthern said: ‘The victim was outraged that these two men had broken into his neighbour’s home and gave chase. When he caught up with one of them he was hit with such force, he received a fractured skull. ‘He staggered backwards and fell to the ground, leaving him with a broken ankle and in a lot of pain.’ Crolla has won 29 of his 35 fights and next month’s would have provided the biggest payday of his career.

"Another victim: Liz Seccuro (pictured) was raped at University of Virginia fraternity Phi Kappa Psi in 1984, the same house fingered in the recent Rolling Stone article now under question . While the Rolling Stone article about an alleged gang-rape at University of Virginia fraternity Phi Kappa Psi is under question, there's one detail from the story not in dispute - the fact that a woman was raped in a strikingly similar manner at the same house three decades ago. A Phi Psi brother was convicted of the crime. Victim Liz Seccuro, has spoken out in the wake of the Rolling Stone article and it's subsequent backlash, to tell The Daily Beast her own horrifying account of rape at the fraternity when she was a student at UVA in the mid-1980s. She published a book on the experience titled 'Crash Into Me' in 2011. Earlier this month, she defended victim 'Jackie' and the rush to fact-check the UVA junior's rape account, who Rolling Stone admits was not properly vetted in an apology letter. While Phi Psi is named as the fraternity where Jackie was gang-raped in the article, it is now unclear if she was assaulted at that house since she came out to say she wasn't certain it happened at that specific fraternity. Seccruro though remembers exactly where her rape took place, and even knew one of per perpetrators. She was 17-years-old in August 1984 when she left her home in Rye, New York to study English at the Charlottesville, Virginia university. On the night of October 5, 1984, just five weeks into college, one of Seccuro's new friends Jim (name changed) asked her to be his date to a rush event at the Phi Psi fraternity. She agreed, wanting to help her fellow freshman get into the exclusive all-boys club,  and helped him talk to brothers at the event with a band, dancing and free booze. But the two got separated when they ventured upstairs and Jim was invited into a room to smoke marijuana with some of the brothers. While sitting on a couch, waiting for her date to return, Seccuro says two brothers at the bar asked her if she wanted a drink and she agreed. But things took a bad turn when she started to feel 'dizzy and disconnected' after drinking the so-called 'house special'. 'Suddenly, after a few sips of the green drink, I noticed something wrong. Extraordinarily wrong. I could not feel my hands or feet. My arms and legs began to feel numb. I started to panic, breathing shallowly and rapidly,' Seccuro recalled. It was then that a tall brown-haired man with wire rimmed glasses sat down to talk to her, and she told him she was thinking about going home because she was feeling tired. Scene: Seccuro says she was gang-raped by three men at the Phi Psi house just five weeks after starting at UVA in 1984. She later brought one of her rapists to justice when he wrote a letter apologizing to her for the incident, which was used as evidence . History repeating: Seccuro's story is strikingly similar to that of 'Jackie' (pictured) the current UVA junior who told a horrifying account of gang-rape at the campus fraternity to Rolling Stone. Jackie's account is now being torn apart after it was revealed she wasn't completely certain the rape happened at Phi Psi . Instead, he forcefully grabbed her arm and said 'I have something to show you' before lifting her off the couch and taking her to a bedroom. Seccuro says that the man made her sit on his lap and began reading her poetry. Panicked, she managed to escape and run down the hall to the room where her handbag had been stored. The door was locked so she began yelling and kicking the door. That's when the music turned up and a brother behind the bar picked her up and took her back to the bespectacled man. The bespectacled man then pinned her down by the arms and legs and raped her repeatedly, despite her protestations. Seccuro says she passed out from the fear and pain but woke up a few times during the night, when she heard voices, slamming doors and felt hands on her. The next morning she woke up on an orange sofa across the hallway from where the rape occurred, and quickly fled the house, but not before sifting through her rapist's mail, identifying him as a student named William Beebe. She then walked to the University of Virginia medical center for treatment, but after sitting in the emergency room for several hours a nurse came up and told she would need to travel to Richmond or Washington, DC if she wanted the necessary 'tests'. Defeated, Seccuro walked back to her dorm room where she had to wait a full three days to report the incident to the then-Dean of Students Robert Canevari. Sorry: While her initial attempts to bring her rapists to justice in 2006 were flouted by the university, Seccuro's rapist William Beede was sentenced in 2007 after sending her the confession letter . Still bruised and battered, Seccuro says her Monday meeting with Canevari did not go well. 'He dismissed me and told me I had “had sex with a young man and didn’t want my parents to know I wasn’t a good girl.” He suggested I needed mental help, and offered to help me transfer to another college,' Seccuro says. Canevari also told Seccuro that she could not report the rape to the Charlottesville Police, since it wasn't in their 'jurisdiction' - a statement she would learn was completely untrue years later. He referred Seccuro to another administrator, Dean Sybil Todd, who was a bit more understanding. Dean Todd arranged for her to be interviewed by a student journalist to write about the attack for the campus paper and continued to be a personal ally throughout the rest of her college career. She also helped Seccuro tell her story to campus police Captain Michael Sheffield, who promised to investigate the attack. 'Nothing ever came of the “investigation.” I called Sheffield’s office regularly, and I was routinely told someone would get back to me...No one ever called me back.' Seccuro graduated from UVA in 1988 with a degree in English literature, but no justice for her crime. Short sentence: Beede (pictured) only spent less than six months in prison, because his 10 year sentence was mostly suspended . Her case took an unexpected turn in September 2005 though, when her rapist sent her an apology letter, as part of his Alcoholics Anonymous program. She took the letter to the Charlottesville Police and it was then that she learned that local authorities did indeed have the power to investigate crimes at the fraternity and that there is no statue of limitations on rape in Virginia. Beebe was arrested in January 2006 and charged with two felony counts of rape. During the grand jury process, Seccuro learned that Beebe wasn't the only man who violated her that night. Private investigators hired by Beebe's defense attorneys tracked down two men who also allegedly raped her and when they appeared before the jury, they pleaded the Fifth Amendment to every question. 'Police contacted dozens of witnesses from that night. Many were interviewed. Many declined to be interviewed. The bonds of Phi Kappa Psi brotherhood were too strong to break. There were witnesses who are sons of powerful men; congressmen, senators, captains of industry. It was—and is—heartbreaking.' Beebe struck a plea deal with prosecutors two weeks before his case was set to go to trial, in which the rape charges were dropped and instead he pleaded guilty to a single charge of aggravated sexual battery. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but only ended up serving less than six months because most of the sentence was suspended. However, Seccuro believes that justice was served and says she's forgiven Beebe for the vile crime he committed against her. 'I forgave William Beebe decades ago.... I do not forgive those who saw the attacks and have refused to cooperate with law enforcement. These are men who now have wives and children, and their silence so many years later shows how morally bankrupt they remain. I cannot begin to understand it,' she says. Allies: Seccuro says former UVA Dean Sybil Todd (left) helped her deal with the rape in college, and that Charlottesville Chief of Police Timothy Longo (right) helped her bring her attacker to justice in 2006 . Seccuro adds that she is glad she came forward and had her rapist tried, because it gives other rape victims like her hope of justice. 'When I think of the many rape victims who never come forward, who have been silenced in the same fashion, I am saddened. When colleges and universities systematically lie to victims and shuttle them toward administrators whose jobs depend upon protecting the good names of their employers, all of us lose. 'But I fought, and I fought hard, so that others after me have hope, and a chance.' Seccuro spoke out earlier this month to defend Jackie's story to Time magazine, repeating the statistic that false rape stories are extremely rare . 'Wholesale doubt or dismissal of a rape account because it sounds “too bad to be true” is ridiculous. Is it easier to believe a rape by a single stranger upon a woman in a dark alley?

"The streets of Moscow yesterday rang with the sound of panic. It came in the form of anxious gossip in queues at banks and bureaux de change as Russians lined up to exchange their roubles for hard currency. It came in the form of whirring cash registers as Muscovites rushed to buy imported groceries and furniture before prices soared, emptying the shelves at the mega-malls that have sprung up around the capital. And it came in the form of a babble of lies from state television as it tried to reassure Russians that the government is fully in control. Except it clearly was not. Scroll down for video . Vladimir Putin yesterday: With the collapse in the rouble, this week may well be remembered as the moment the wheels fell off Vladimir Putin’s economy and the collapse of his regime really began . ‘The rouble has passed a tipping point,’ says one senior Western banker with nearly 20 years’ experience in Moscow. This week may well be remembered as the moment the wheels fell off Vladimir Putin’s economy and the collapse of his regime really began. His government has tried increasingly desperate measures to prop up confidence in the rouble, and yet its slide has only accelerated – and the sheen of invincibility that the Russian people once accorded their leader has begun to wear off. ‘We’ve lost the feeling that Putin is some kind of wizard who controls everything,’ wrote the usually rabidly pro-Kremlin tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets. In fairness, the rouble’s slide has been slowed a little by massive spending of Russia’s hard currency reserves, even though just days earlier the Moscow Central Bank had promised to stop wasting precious dollars on such apparently futile actions. The reason for this change of heart is simple – today Vladimir Putin is due to give his annual marathon press conference, televised live, and he does not want to appear before the nation as the rouble tanks. ‘But after the conference,’ one Moscow banker joked grimly, ‘we can expect the deluge.’ Hard cash: People queue at an exchange in front of electronic information board displaying exchange rates in Moscow yesterday as they try to exchange the roubles in their wallets for more stable dollars or euros . Investments: A man studies the contents of his bags in front of a luxury Cartier boutique in Moscow, where Russians are buying expensive goods that might keep their value better than the plummeting currency . Putin faces a perfect storm of economic problems. The principal one – the collapse in world oil prices that has hit all energy-producing countries – is beyond his control. But much of this crisis is of Putin’s own making, and unique to Russia. For one thing, despite countless promises to do so, he has failed dismally to diversify the grotesquely corrupt Russian economy away from oil and gas. While oil prices were high, it didn’t seem to matter – indeed, Russia’s energy exports fuelled a boom with average wages rising 15-fold since Putin came to power. But now they’ve gone through the floor it is a very different matter. Furthermore, Putin’s belligerence has turned a crisis into a catastrophe. In the wake of the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH-17 in July by Moscow-backed Ukrainian rebels, the US and EU imposed simple but devastating economic sanctions on Russian companies. By banning a swathe of state-controlled companies from borrowing on international money markets, the West poisoned the heart of Russia’s economy. Russian companies owe Western creditors nearly $700billion – and between now and the end of 2015 will have to pay back some $150billion of that money. With access to Western banks cut off, the only place they can turn to for the hard currency needed to pay back those debts is the state – and this week, by some estimates, Russia’s hard currency reserves fell below the level required to service these companies’ loans. Already it’s clear that Putin’s priority is to protect his cronies first and foremost. On Tuesday he ordered the Central Bank to issue $10billion in bonds to bail out the state-owned Rosneft oil company, run by Putin’s long-time KGB colleague, Igor Sechin. Though the company denied it, Moscow financiers suspect Rosneft immediately used the money to buy hard currency. Panic buying: Women push carts with their purchases at the IKEA store on the outskirts of Moscow . Last chance: Muscovites buy imported electronic appliances while their money will still stretch to afford them . Other members of Russia’s super rich are trying to convert their roubles into London property. Gary Hersham, of estate agents Beauchamp Estates, said: ‘I have half a dozen Russian clients urgently looking to spend over £20million each on buying a new home in prime Central London.’ In Moscow their less wealthy countrymen were flocking to stores to snap up home appliances, cars and electrical goods. Customers stormed Ikea while Apple suspended online sales. The fact that economic collapse now threatens the Putin regime means the situation is terrifyingly volatile. Given his past form, it’s more than likely that Putin’s KGB-trained instinct will be to try to repress all opposition to his rule – even though it is growing by the day. Worse, there’s a strong possibility that he will attempt to distract the population with a military adventure. The annexation of Crimea in February brought a giant, if relatively short-lived, spike in popularity. Already in recent weeks Russian troops, ships and planes have been playing cat-and-mouse with Nato. Sweden has reported at least one near miss in its airspace between an airliner and a Russian military plane. RAF jets have been scrambled to see off incursions into British air space 100 times this year alone. And Russian bombers armed with nuclear missiles have resumed long-range flights over the coasts of the US. This may be nothing but posturing by a president whose only language is that of macho, Cold-War era military display. But for Russia’s nervous Nato-member neighbours – especially the Baltic states such as Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania – there is a real belief that he could lash out. Closely watched: RAF Typhoon jets were scrambled in October to track this Russian Tu-95 Bear H bomber, one of two which flew close to Britain without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers. Followed: These RAF images show the moment the aircraft were escorted by Typhoons near British airspace . The bombers which flew near Britain were just two of 26 Russian planes intercepted over Europe in 24 hours . Putin has ratcheted up his rhetoric against the West since the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis in February: ‘Nato remains a military alliance, and we are against having a military alliance making itself at home right in our own backyard,’ he warned. Meanwhile, even though US President Barack Obama always held off from directly supporting Ukraine’s army in its struggle against Russian-backed militias in Eastern Ukraine, the newly elected Republican-dominated US Congress recently authorized the provision of $350million of weaponry for the Ukrainians. This could be just the kind of excuse Putin has been waiting for to escalate the conflict in Ukraine. He knows that Russian aggression increases global tension – and that this has always led to increases in oil prices. The fact is that Russia’s failed economy and increasingly restive population mean Putin is cornered, like a wounded animal, with very few options left. That is why, right now, he is more dangerous than ever.","Russian currency plummets despite interest rate rises and reserve spend .

"This is the moment a music-lover sparked a mass sing-along by passengers standing on a platform at a London Underground station. An Erasure fan led an impromptu version of the band's 1980s classic 'A Little Respect' while he was waiting for a train at Kentish Town. After breaking into song in what started as a solo performance, dozens of passengers decided to join in. An Erasure fan led an impromptu version of the band's 1980s classic 'A Little Respect' while he was at the Kentish Town underground station in London . The video was posted online by one of the vocal participants and soon proved a hit on social media. Today, the leader of the singalong was revealed as Erasure fan Neil Francis, who sings at venues in and around the Great Yarmouth area in Norfolk. He launched into the rendition on his way back from an Erasure gig at the nearby Forum music venue - and judging by the reaction, some of the passengers had been to the same concert. Video footage first shows him taking on the tune himself, before the camera turns to show hoards of other music fans chiming in.

"A Czech family couple renovating their home has found several items once belonging to Jewish people forced into the ghetto in Terezin during the Second World War. The house owners have found photos, shoes and other personal possessions in their attic in the town of Terezin, known better in Holocaust contexts by its German name, Theresienstadt. Terezin, a fortress and garrison town built at the end of the 18th century, was used by the Nazis as a transit camp for Jews rounded up in Czechoslovakia and deported from elsewhere in Europe. Discovery: Personal belongings of Jewish people held in the Nazi ghetto of in Terezin during the Second World War have been found in an attic during a renovation of a home . Nearly 160,000 Jews went through Terezin, a majority of whom were held in the ghetto until they could be transported to camps farther east. Most prisoners perished in the Theresienstadt ghetto,  or in the death camps of Nazi-occupied eastern Europe. When the Theresienstadt camp was finally liberated by Russian tanks in May 1945, only 11 per cent of the 156,000 people who had passed through its gates had survived, and just 100 of the 15,000 Jewish children were still alive. The discovery of the objects, some of which bore their owner's names, was disclosed by the Ghetto Theresienstadt project, which is funded by German and Czech sponsors. 'The unexpected finds such as these suggest that an abundance of precious legacies from the ghetto period are still waiting to be discovered in buildings throughout Terezin,' the group said in a news release. Nearly 160,000 Jews went through Terezin, a majority of whom were held in the ghetto until they could be transported to camps farther east . The group said the highlight of the find was the head tefillin, a small black capsule containing a handwritten parchment scroll with the 'Hear, O Israel' verses from Deuteronomy. Observant Jewish men are obliged to wear tefillin during their morning prayers and the capsules, one for the head and one for an arm, are cherished belongings. The group said the home owners wished to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue among Terezin inhabitants. They discovered the objects while replacing a roof truss in their attic in November. 'In their view, the way that the objects were concealed under the beams indicates the great importance that the prisoners gave in hiding their possessions,' the group said. The Ghetto Theresienstadt projects started in 2012 and is supported by the German Federal Cultural Foundation;, the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future Foundation; the Prague-based German-Czech Future Fund; and other groups in Germany and Czech Republic.","Personal belongings of Jewish people held in Nazi ghetto found .

"High Street stores have been caught up in an investigation into claims immigrants were used as slave labour and forced to work 80 hours a week for ‘pennies’. The discovery was made when police raided a factory in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, and found 20 eastern European ‘slaves’ making picture frames and other items. Today it has emerged that B&M Bargains, which is run by former Tesco chief Sir Terry Leahy, and Floors2Go are among major retailers caught up in the inquiry. High Street stores have been caught up in an investigation into claims immigrants were used as slave labour and forced to live in squalor . B&M Bargains, which is run by former Tesco chief Sir Terry Leahy (pictured), and Floors2Go are among major retailers caught up in the inquiry . A spokesman for B&M Retail – which owns B&M Bargains - said the company was 'shocked to learn of these recent allegations' The immigrants were allegedly beaten, verbally abused and forced to work 12 hour days by ‘slave-masters’ for just a fraction of the minimum wage. They were forced to live in a squalid house in Rochdale with the workers sleeping three or four to a room and sharing all facilities. The men and women were being bussed to work in the industrial unit each morning, where they were paid around £1.50 an hour. At the end of the week their £125 wage was docked £100 for rent and living expenses and they were handed just £25 to spend on themselves – equivalent to being paid 31p an hour. Detective Inspector James Faulkner of Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said: ‘This is another excellent result from a joint operation which has strived to uncover and protect vulnerable victims from the men and women hoping to exploit them for their own financial gain. ‘The men and women working in the factory have told us that they were subjected to physical and verbal assaults at the hands of their employers and forced to work more than 80 hours before ending up with around £25 for their week’s work.’ He said: ‘This is a typical example of how modern slavery can work in the UK. The men and women are promised accommodation and jobs, but are forced to live in cramped, terrible conditions before being taken to work in a factory for more than 12 hours each day. The immigrants were forced to live in a squalid house in Rochdale with the workers sleeping three or four to a room and sharing all facilities . They were allegedly beaten, verbally abused and forced to work 12 hour days by ‘slave-masters’ for just a fraction of the minimum wage . ‘At the end of the week, the factory owners pay them around £125 for their 80 hours, but then take up to £100 away immediately for rent, travel and other expenses. ‘This leaves the men and women effectively working for pennies, while simultaneously ensuring they remain reliant on the people enslaving them. ‘When you consider that this factory was producing frames and pictures for major high street companies, with contracts running into the millions of pounds, it proves just how much money these men stood to make from this exploitation.’ The force has launched Operation Retriever in a bid to tackle human trafficking in Rochdale and has already smashed one gang of alleged slavers. A police source said: ‘The conditions these people are kept in is absolutely shocking in modern-day Britain. Unfortunately these people are so desperate and reliant on these unscrupulous slave-masters that they are unable to report the matter because they know they would be deported.’ At the end of the week their £125 wage was docked £100 for rent and living expenses and they were handed just £25 to spend on themselves – equivalent to being paid 31p an hour . The ‘slaves’, all adults, were found during a police raid working in a unit at the Caldershaw Centre in Rochdale and had been subject to ‘physical and verbal abuse’, say police. Mr Faulkner said: ‘Now GMP and our partners in Rochdale council will be striving to safeguard these victims from further exploitation, and we will do our utmost to ensure that the people responsible for this injustice are punished to the full extent of the law.’ B&M Bargains took over many of the defunct Woolworth’s stores when it went to the wall in 2009 and the chairman is Sir Terry Leahy. A spokesman for B&M Retail – which owns B&M Bargains - said: ‘We were shocked to learn of these recent allegations. As soon as being made aware, we terminated trading with the company and cancelled all orders with immediate effect.’ A spokesman for Floors2Go said: ‘Floors2Go is a responsible company and is currently checking to see whether any of its stock originated from the manufacturer which is the subject of this enquiry. ‘We do inspect factories of overseas suppliers but in respect of UK suppliers we rely upon the expectation that they comply with UK laws in relation to health and safety and similar regulations which are enforced by local authorities. ‘The majority of our UK manufactured products are sourced from UK distributors who we expect in turn are responsible companies with lawful employment practices.’ Two men from Rochdale have been charged with slavery-related offences. Mohamad Iqbal, 51, of Belmont Way and Najum Mohammed Iqbal, 40, of Harrison Close are both charged with knowingly requiring another person to perform forced or compulsory labour. Both have been remanded in custody. The pair were due to appear at Bury and Rochdale Magistrates' Court today. Three other men arrested as part of the police operation have been released on bail pending further inquiries.

"A former justice of the peace in North Texas has been sentenced to death for killing a district attorney's wife in what prosecutors have described as a revenge plot that left three people dead. Eric Williams was convicted on December 4 of capital murder in the 2013 death of Cynthia McLelland, who was slain along with her husband, Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland, in their home east of Dallas. Williams has been charged, but not tried, in the deaths of Mike McLelland and prosecutor Mark Hasse. Scroll down for video .

Dead: Eric Williams is charged with killing District Attorney Mike McLelland (left) and convicted of killing his wife, Cynthia (left , right). He is also charged in the death of prosecutor Mark Hasse (right) The 47-year-old Williams lost his job and law license after McLelland and Hasse prosecuted him for theft and burglary. Prosecutors say that conviction pushed Williams over the edge. During his trial, they presented evidence that he paid a friend to rent a storage unit where he kept more than 30 guns, police tactical gear and a getaway car. Authorities say a masked Williams gunned down Hasse in January 2013 outside a courthouse building in broad daylight. Prosecutors say a 'masked assassin,' whom they identified as Williams, approached Hasse as he walked to work and the two shoved each other. They said Hasse pleaded and yelled 'I'm sorry' before he was repeatedly shot. 'His anger was my anger': Kim Williams, the estranged wife of Eric Williams, testifies in court on Tuesday and says she was a 'willing participant' in her husband's revenge killings . Two months later, Williams stormed into the McLellands' rural home and shot both the district attorney and his wife more than a dozen times each, according to evidence at his trial. Williams' wife, Kim, is accused of helping him carry out the slayings and testified before closing arguments on Tuesday that she drove the getaway car in Hasse's death and helped her husband dispose of weapons used in the shooting of the McClellands. She said Eric Williams had a hit list that included former state District Judge Glen Ashworth and Kaufman County District Attorney Erleigh Norville Wiley. Family of Cynthia and Mike McLelland addressed Williams during victim impact statements after he was sentenced to death, according to the Dallas Morning News.

"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo plans to ban fracking in the state, officials announced today. At a press conference on Wednesday, state health and environmental officials citing unresolved health issues and dubious economic benefits for the reason for the ban. Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, uses a mixture of high-pressured water, sand and chemicals to tap into natural gas reserves in the rock, and at the press conference, the officials pointed out studies questioning the long-term safety of the process. New York, which sits on part of a rock formation rich in gas, has banned shale gas development since the state began its environmental review in 2008. Wednesday's announcement, though not final, means a ban is all but etched in stone - and environmentalists are thrilled. Scroll down for video . New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is pictured during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. His administration will move to prohibit fracking in the state, citing unresolved health issues and dubious economic benefits . 'Never before has a state with proven gas reserves banned fracking,' said Deborah Goldberg, an attorney with Earthjustice, adding that the decision 'will give courage to elected leaders throughout the country and world: fracking is too dangerous and must not continue.' Industry representatives expressed disappointment but also have downplayed New York's potential as a major source of natural gas. 'We are very disappointed that it appears the governor is unwilling to be a leader and is going to pass the buck at the expense of New Yorkers,' said Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute. 'This technology has been used for over 65 years in the United States. It's been demonstrated repeatedly after drilling millions of wells that we're able to do it while protecting the environment and protecting the people.' Environmental Commissioner Joe Martens said on Wednesday that he was recommending a ban, and Cuomo, a Democrat, said he would defer to Martens and Acting Health Commissioner Howard Zucker on the decision. The Department of Environmental Conservation will put out a final environmental impact statement early next year, Martens said, and after that he'll issue an order prohibiting fracking. Zucker and Martens on Wednesday summarized environmental and health reviews that concluded fracking carried risks that haven't been studied enough. Dangers: New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Joseph Martens, second from left, talks about hydraulic fracturing during the cabinet meeting at the Capitol on Wednesday . Questions: Acting health commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker presents the department's findings on hydraulic fracturing at the meeting, as officials cite unresolved health issues for its ban . Fracking is the process of drilling into the earth and injecting wells with chemically treated water and sand at high pressure, allowing gas to flow out to the top of the well. The drilling boom in the Marcellus Shale, a rock formation underlying southern New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, was made possible by fracking on a massive scale. The technique has generated tens of billions of dollars in industry profits and landowner royalties, and has reduced energy bills and fuel imports. But it has also brought concerns and sparked protests over air and water pollution, earthquakes, property devaluation, and truck traffic. At the meeting on Wednesday, health officials said they had identified 'significant public health risks' that require long-term studies before fracking can be called safe. Environmental officials noted the low price of natural gas and the high local cost of industry oversight. The drilling boom in the Marcellus Shale, a rock formation underlying southern New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, was made possible by high-volume hydraulic fracturing, which releases gas from rock by injecting wells with chemically treated water at high pressure. The technique has generated tens of billions of dollars in industry profits and landowner royalties, and has reduced energy bills and fuel imports. But it has also brought concerns and sparked protests over air and water pollution, earthquakes, property devaluation, and truck traffic. Zucker said he had identified 'significant public health risks' and 'red flag' health issues that require long-term studies before fracking can be called safe. He likened fracking to secondhand smoke, which wasn't fully understood as a health risk until many years of scientific study were done. Martens noted the low price of natural gas, the high local cost of industry oversight, and the large areas that would be off limits to shale gas development because of setback requirements, water supply protections and local prohibitions. Those factors, he said, combine to make fracking less economically beneficial than anticipated. Even if drilling were allowed in New York, it wouldn't likely take off anytime soon because of the uncertainty around regulations and legal challenges, and the huge amount of promising drilling locations that remain in fracking-friendly neighbor Pennsylvania, said David Spigelmyer, president of the industry group Marcellus Shale Coalition. Fight: A woman holds an anti-fracking sign as demonstrators gather for a rally for a Global Climate Treaty in New York City earlier this month. Environmentalists have expressed their joy at the state's decision . The location of the rock entices producers because of its proximity to the major demand centers of New York City and New England, which is paying more for gas because of delivery constraints. But the uncertainty remains too high to commit. In states where fracking is not yet allowed or is happening but subject to criticism, New York's move excited some anti-drilling activists. 'The more fracking expands, the more opposition grows,' said Sharon Wilson, of the group Earthworks, who has organized anti-fracking activists in Texas, California and Colorado. 'Industry is its own worst enemy because they continue to deny the impacts.' Fracking supporters decried the New York move. Karen Moreau, executive director of New York's branch of the American Petroleum Institute, said the Cuomo administration is denying landowners the right to develop their mineral resources. 'The secretary of energy, the U.S. EPA administrator and President Obama recognize the benefits of fracking, and yet the Cuomo administration simply did not want to anger their activist base,' Moreau said. Cuomo said he is anticipating lawsuits being filed 'every which way from Sunday.'","State health and environmental officials cited unresolved health issues and dubious economic benefits on Wednesday as the reason for the ban .

"Roberto Martinez has expressed relief after Kevin Mirallas and Leon Osman received positive news on the injuries that had left him fearing they would face long lay-offs. Mirallas, who was left on crutches following a heavy challenge by QPR's Jordon Mutch, will miss Saturday's trip to Southampton with damaged ankle ligaments but he is expected to be ready for the Boxing Day clash at Goodison Park with Stoke. Osman, meanwhile, does not require surgery on the problem that had left him wearing a protective boot on his ankle and he should be fit to play a part in a period over Christmas that Martinez will shape Everton's season. Kevin Mirallas picked up an injury during Everton's win over QPR on Monday night . Mirallas left the pitch on a stretcher but is not expected to be out for too long . 'We have great news,' said Martinez. 'We were very, very worried after the game because it was an action where you feel there was definite damage. 'But the scans have showed it was the least it could have been. The game on Saturday is a bit too early, but I don't think he will be out for too long. 'I wouldn't rule him out of any more games over Christmas.' 'Leon is progressing well, we are assessing him day by day. An operation was the worst case scenario, but he has reacted well enough and we are hopeful he will be OK without the need for that.' Leon Osman is expected to play some part over the Christmas period after his injury . Osman got into the festive spirit at the club's training ground by wearing a Christmas jumper . Starting with Southampton, Everton have a run of four games in 12 days and Martinez has urged his squad to take advantage of a prime opportunity and get some momentum to set them up for an assault on the Champions League places in the New Year. Martinez, who has ruled out the idea of making big changes during the January transfer window, said: 'We can see every game as an opportunity now. The games we have got now are very important. 'The only concentration is on the league. The next 12 days are going to be really significant in terms of the second half of the season. I am delighted with how the squad is. Everton manager Roberto Martinez is pleased with his club's injury news . 'The group has a very strong mentality. The only thing that we can be critical about is that we have not got the points we should have done.

"James Coleman, 18, of Netherton, Liverpool, and another boy scrawled the vile comments just a few hours after  Erick Maina's body was found . A teenager who daubed racist graffiti on a memorial to Liverpool schoolboy Erick Maina just hours after he died has been jailed for two years. James Coleman, 18, of Netherton, Liverpool, and another boy scrawled the vile comments just a few hours after Kenyan-born Erick's body was found. Coleman and a 17-year-old, who cannot be named, made references to 'white power', supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan and painted swastikas at Erick's school, Maricourt High in Southport, and nearby Balls Wood Park, . He also wrote: 'Nothing better than a n***** dead'. Police are not treating Erick's death as suspicious and an inquest has not yet been held. Erick's grieving father told a court the vile graffiti 'was like rubbing salt in our open wounds'. Erick, an aspiring doctor who raised money for cancer charities, was found at his family home in Fazakerley, Liverpool, on November 15 just hours after posting 'bye' on his Facebook account. Liverpool Crown Court heard Coleman and his partner-in-crime struck after hundreds of Erick's friends gathered at the school as news of his death spread on social networking sites. Maricourt headteacher Brendan McLoughlin had opened the school for pupils to sign a book of condolence while school friends also began their own tribute, posting flowers and notes to a fence on the site. A victim impact statement from Erick's father Stephen was read out in court. He said: 'Having lost my wonderful son, the damage that these boys did was like rubbing salt in our open wounds. A teenager who daubed racist graffiti on a memorial to Liverpool schoolboy Erick Maina, 15, (pictured) just hours after he died has been jailed for two years - another boy, aged 17, has been locked up for 10 months. 'I have no understanding of why anyone would want to hurt a family further by doing such an act of malicious hate. 'The words and the graffiti was all so hurtful and it did not just hurt my family, but our wider Kenyan community. We have all been shocked by this incident. 'To a degree, I have ignored the press coverage of this incident because I could not have been hurt any more. I had lost my son, I was at rock bottom, nothing could cause me further pain. 'What these boys did was a very bad thing and I believe it is a good thing that they are getting punished for their mistakes because we must learn from our mistakes. That is so important. 'When Erick died, the community that I live with and all Erick's friends at school and around this area poured out pure love and kindness towards our family in our time of need. This is what has supported our family and helped us deal with this further pain. 'The love and kindness was tremendous and shows us just how highly thought of our son was within this community and at school. Some of the vile and racist graffiti Coleman and a 17-year-old boy who cannot be named daubed at the school . 'These two boys are not much older than Erick and for whatever reason they decided to do what they did and in doing so I believe they have destroyed their lives. 'Erick loved all people, no matter what their colour or background, and people of all backgrounds loved Erick in return. 'I would like these boys to get as much help as possible to become better citizens and to learn to love and respect all people the way my wonderful son Erick did.' Crown prosecutor Chris Taylor said: 'Swastikas had been painted across windows, brickwork and the bonnet of one of the cars belonging to a sister employed at the school. 'This court will appreciate the power of that misused symbol in terms of reflecting the very worst that humanity is capable of towards minority communities. 'References are also seen in relation to 'KKK' and 'white power', both terms of extreme hatred to-wards the non-white members of this community. 'The hatred shown by the defendants is expressively summed up by the references to 'n*****' and 'Eric was a black n*****' Erick's grieving father told Liverpool Crown Court the vile graffiti 'was like rubbing salt in our open wounds' 'Even the students' memorial did not escape their hatred and vandalism. On the footpath was painted 'n*****' with an arrow pointing towards the flowers and cards.' James Smith, defending, said: 'One runs out of adjectives to describe his behaviour. 'All he can say through me is that he is very, very sorry for what he has done.' The court heard that Coleman, who has a string of previous convictions, including criminal damage, burglary and theft, has since written a letter of apology to Erick's family. Judge Mr Recorder Stuart Driver told Coleman: 'There was bigotry in every stroke of your brush. 'This was racism writ large, it was a public display of vile bitterness. 'The great majority of the public will be profoundly shocked by it. 'It was also an act which caused great insult and pain to a small family which had suffered its bereavement on the very same day.' He said: 'Erick was loved by his family and their loss is incalculable. Coleman and the 17-year-old painted swastikas at Erick's school, Maricourt High in Southport (pictured) 'He was spontaneously mourned by hundreds of people who attended his school for an impromptu show of support. 'What you did in response to that was to go to the supermarket and buy paint and a brush.' The judge added: 'It is not the value of the damage that's the central part of this case. 'The things that you wrote were deeply offensive. I need not use adjectives to describe them, simply reading them out will allow them to speak for themselves.' Coleman admitted two charges of racially aggravated criminal damage and asked for a further offence to be taken into consideration. Mr Recorder Driver sentenced Coleman to two years in youth detention. The 17-year-old boy was convicted to 10 months in detention by a youth court last week.

"Clutching tightly on to a finger, this adorable little western pygmy possum is actually one of the largest of its species. Native to Australia, the tiny nocturnal marsupial looks wide-eyed in the daylight as it holds on to the hand of its photographer. Take by PhD student Amanda McLean of Adelaide University, this candid shot was snapped while on a field trip. Adelaide University student Amanda McLean captured the photo of this pygmy possum while on a field trip to the northern Eyre Peninsula, South Australia . 'I just couldn't help taking the picture when the little fellow climbed up and clung on to my finger and sort of sat back on the rest of my hand,' Amanda said. 'It is a western pygmy possum native to southern Australia and was taken on northern Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. 'The pygmy possum was caught during a field trip at a site where it has been studied for 20 years to investigate how the pygmy possum population responds to rainfall in the semi-arid environment. These adorable western pygmy possums weigh between 8 and 21 grams and spend most of their time in trees . 'Pygmy possums are nocturnal and weigh between eight and 21 grams. They spend most of their time in trees, however, they do come down to the ground in order to change trees when foraging. 'Despite their small size, they can travel very quickly on the ground and this is when they can be caught in pitfall traps, otherwise known as a bucket dug into the ground.' Amanda - who is studying conservation, molecular ecology, mammals and desert ecology - added that the little creatures can often appear to go missing from any given area for a number of years. 'During dry years pygmy possums occur in very low numbers and can appear to 'disappear' from the area for between five and ten years, however, after heavy rains the population can increase dramatically as they respond to the sudden increase in pollen and insects, which they feed off. At eight centimetres long, the Western Pygmy Possum is one of the largest of the five types of pygmy possums, also found in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea . 'This is a very different to more temperate regions where possum numbers tend to be very constant. 'They can also use torpor, a deep sleep-like state, to conserve energy. Torpor is particularly useful when food resources are low or during low temperatures. 'During torpor they curl up into a tight ball and are often found like this in the trap and it can take some effort to wake them up.'

"Most dog adoption ads play up the pet's charm and eager personality, but the Humane Society has taken a different approach. The organization's Silicon Valley shelter, in Milpitas, California, is brutally honest in a blog post warning readers not to adopt 'Eddie the Terrible', a two-year-old Chihuahua. The tongue-in-cheek attack on Eddie's character claims: 'Inside that innocuous, adorable blonde package exists tons - indeed, whole square miles - of naughty.' Naughty: The Humane Society Silicon Valley is brutally honest in an adoption posting for 'Eddie the Terrible', a two-year-old Chihuahua . The post goes on to outline three reasons why Eddie lives up to his unfortunate nickname; the first is that he's apparently prone to fights with other canines. 'While Eddie The Terrible has never actually attacked another dog, he's made it abundantly clear that he hasn't ruled out the possibility. 'He goes from zero to Cujo in .05 seconds when he sees another dog on leash. Well, sayeth you, lots of small dogs bark at other dogs on leash.' The ad also warns that Eddie may not warm up to children very easily. 'Some dogs love kids. We have a bunch of child-lovin' dogs. Eddie the Terrible, however, is not one of them. Honestly he's a little whiffy with some adults, too. Not in an eat-them sort of way but in ""this makes me very nervous"" sort of way.' And finally, Eddie has high-maintenance preferences for where he hangs out. Happy ending: Eddie, pictured here with a Humane Society staff member, has been adopted by a big-hearted couple . 'Worried about dog hair on the furniture? Very valid worry if you adopt Eddie. While Eddie is crate trained, he has a weird thing about sleeping in the crate. And by weird thing we mean ""nope, not happening"". A bed in your room? Awesome.' Of course, the post also lists plenty of Eddie's positive attributes along the way; for example, he's 'housebroken, loyal, fun and friendly' and 'lives to play fetch'. After the hilarious post, which ran December 9, Eddie was adopted - despite his shortcomings. The organization announced the good news in a post on its Facebook page Tuesday afternoon: 'ADOPTED! Oh yes, it's true. Eddie The Terrible found a couple with a big heart, no kids, and an endless amount of patience.' Bernadette Cruz, director of marketing for the organization, told USA Today: 'We are really thrilled to have found a home for him.' She added that the retired couple who heard about Eddie on the local news were 'so excited about him and knew they could provide a loving home'.","The tongue-in-cheek ad claims: 'Inside that innocuous, adorable blonde package exists tons - indeed, whole square miles - of naughty'

"A radical Muslim student who wanted a black flag of Islam flown over Downing Street sobbed today as he was found guilty of planning to join rebel forces in Syria. David Souaan, 20, was accused of preparing for terrorist acts in the war-torn country and was stopped by anti-terror police at Heathrow on May 31. The prosecution said he had visited in December last year and was on his way back to fight the jihadist cause when he was arrested. Facing jail: David Souaan, 20, who posed with this Kalashnikov on a trip to Syria last year and was arrested at Heathrow because he planned to return, sobbed as he was found guilty of terror offences today . Guilty: An Old Bailey jury took just nine hours to reject Souaan's claims he only held the weapons because he 'wanted to look cool' - instead deciding he was an extremist who planned to fight in Syria . He posed in Syria with machine guns and on a tank  but he claimed he only held the weapons because he 'wanted to look cool' and the photographs were just to keep as 'trophies'. The Birkbeck College student, who comes from a wealthy family in Serbia, insisted his earlier visit to Syria was to collect his grandfather's belongings. But a jury took nine hours to find him guilty following a trial at the Old Bailey. Souaan, the son of a Serbian Christian mother and Syrian Muslim father, grew up in his mother's country but still had close family ties to Syria and had adopted his father's religion. Warning: Souaan, pictured left in his police mugshot, was studying in the UK but fellow students tipped off police because he was spouting radical views and was showing pictures of himself with guns, right . Cache: The court was shown this picture of Souaan on top of a tank and holding a machine gun - but one video clip on his iPhone was 'so graphic and so shocking' that it could not be played to the jury . He came to the UK in 2013 on a three-year visa to study global politics and international relations at Birkbeck College in London, living in halls of residence in Malet Street. He was arrested after fellow students became concerned at his radical views on Islam and he had shown off pictures of himself posing with guns. Police seized his laptop and iPhone and found a mass of pictures, videos and documents revealing his 'extremist sympathies' and that he had not only been fighting in Syria before but was intending to return, the Old Bailey heard. Contact: Souaan kept in contact by text with his Christian Serbian girlfriend, Ana Lazovic (pictured), who had gone to Miami in the US to study, and called him by his pet name 'little panda' Prosecutor Sarah Whitehouse QC said one video clip on his iPhone was 'so graphic and so shocking' that it could not be played in court. It featured a young-looking man kneeling with his head held back as another man cut his throat. Message: Souaan told Ms Lazovic (pictured) that he loved his 'little sweetie' 'more than anything in the world' The court heard that Souaan filmed himself attending a demonstration in the UK involving hate cleric Anjem Choudary. In the background, a man can be heard to say: 'The flag of Tawheed in London, all praise be to Allah the lord of the universe' - in reference to the fervent wish of Muslim extremists to see the black flag fly over Downing Street. In his defence, Souaan told jurors that he had accompanied his father to his home town of Deir ez-Zor in Syria for two nights in December last year. He said he only went to help retrieve his 82-year-old grandfather's belongings after he fled to Turkey with just the clothes on his back. He posed for pictures with guns because he wanted to look 'cool', he said: 'At the time when I was there I felt something like I wanted some trophy - the photos. 'As the teenagers say nowadays, it looks 'cool'. So that was the reason.' Souaan, whose father made a fortune in the construction business in Serbia, insisted that, while he was in the town held by the Free Syrian Army, he never had a weapon. He said he had been 'lonely' in London after arriving for his first term of university on October 6 last year. He kept in contact by text with his Christian Serbian girlfriend, Ana Lazovic, who had gone to Miami in the US to study. She called him by his pet name 'little panda' and he told her he loved his 'little sweetie' 'more than anything in the world'. Denial: Souaan, a student at Birkbeck College (pictured), London,  he never had a weapon himself . Demonstration: The court heard that Souaan had filmed himself attending a demonstration in the UK involving hate cleric Anjem Choudary (pictured) Judge Peter Rook adjourned sentencing until February for pre-sentence reports. Souaan began to cry as Judge Rook warned him that jail would be inevitable when he is sentenced on Tuesday February 3. Remanding him in custody, the judge said: 'You have been convicted of a very serious offence indeed. You must understand that you will be receiving a custodial sentence in this case.'","David Souaan, 20, was arrested at Heathrow trying to flee for Syria in May .

"With deep gashes on her forehead and dark bruising around her eyes, this is the horrific aftermath of a near-fatal domestic violence attack. Hayley Lowles was left in a coma with a fractured skull, cheek and jaw and bleeding on the brain after her partner slammed an oven door on her head so hard the glass broke. He also brutally assaulted the 34-year-old, breaking her nose and leaving part of her skull lodged in her brain. Matthew Sargent, 30, has now been jailed for 16½ years after being convicted of attempted murder. Hayley Lowes, a mother-of-one, was left in coma with a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain after her partner savagely beat her and then slammed an oven door on her head. And the mother-of-one has bravely decided to release photographs of her injuries to encourage other victims of abusive relationships to get help. ‘I feel if I could help just one person to have a good Christmas by escaping an abusive relationship then it feels like what I went through had a purpose,’ she said. ‘Whether they hit you or not, if you’re scared of them then it is not a normal relationship. I can’t believe it took him to nearly kill me for me to leave. You never realise how awful it is and how unhappy you are until you leave.’ The hairdresser was attacked at her home in Basildon, Essex, on August 22 last year when her partner of seven years snapped during an argument about his drinking. She was left for dead after Sargent – who has been classed a danger to the public by psychologists – punched her at least ten times and hit her with the oven door. Survivor: Hayley was attacked at her home in Basildon, Essex, on the evening of August 22 last year after her partner snapped during an argument. Thug: Matthew Sargent was sentenced to 16 and a half years imprisonment, plus five years on licence, after being found guilty of attempted murder at Basildon Crown Court in May . He then grabbed their son William, aged seven months at the time, as he left the flat before going to an off-licence to buy more alcohol. The assault was so violent Miss Lowles remembers little about it – but she managed to crawl outside, where passers-by called for help. Hayley's injuries left her unable to continue her career as they have affected her concentration . Doctors put her in an induced coma to help stabilise her condition. She has since had numerous operations to repair her skull and plastic surgery to her face, which was so swollen after the attack she was barely recognisable. Although it was the first time Sargent turned violent, he had tormented Miss Lowles with years of psychological abuse. ‘I would never have classed what Matt did as domestic abuse. But now I’m aware it was so much worse than I ever realised,’ she said. Sargent’s behaviour always became worse around Christmas, she added, when he would disappear and spend the money they’d saved on a drink and drugs binge. ‘We never had one Christmas where he wasn’t arrested,’ she said. ‘He would always promise me lavish presents – but I just wanted a normal Christmas.’ Following his conviction at Basildon Crown Court in May, police described Sargent as a ‘violent and manipulative man’. Miss Lowles has been unable to return to work since the attack because she now suffers problems with her concentration. But she is rebuilding her life with her son – who is now 23 months old – and has agreed to be the face of an abuse awareness campaign run by Essex County Council and local police. ‘The attack did take a lot away from me. But I do still feel like I had a lucky escape – I could have died,’ she said. The Essex police and crime commissioner Nick Alston added that society must collectively ‘support victims and raise awareness of this abhorrent crime’. Stoic: Hayley is now rebuilding her life with her 23-month-old son, William, at their new home .","Hayley Lowles is lucky to be alive after savage attack by ex-partner .

"A mother who was declared not guilty by reason of insanity after being charged with three counts of attempted murder for driving her three children into the ocean in a van may have been triggered by her most recent pregnancy. Dr. Jeffrey Danziger testified in a Daytona Beach, Florida courtroom on Tuesday that 33-year-old Ebony Wilkerson's mental crisis last March was likely triggered by her pregnancy, but that her symptoms disappeared after she gave birth to her child while in jail. Wilkerson's mental illness appears to be in remission, and there is nothing in her behavior to indicate that she is dangerous, Danziger said. 'She has done well in the past seven months,' the psychiatrist added. Scroll down for video . Ebony Wilkerson (above) went insane and tried to murder her children after being triggered by a recent pregnancy . In March, Wilkerson drove her van into the ocean in Daytona Beach, Florida with her three children inside (above) But Dr. William Meadows, a psychologist, argued that Wilkerson needs to be forcibly confined for treatment so she can get a handle on her mental illness. She has shown an unwillingness to admit she has mental illness, Meadows said, and what happened last March was similar to a 2005 episode when Wilkerson was hearing voices to kill her family and herself. 'We don't have a handle on what's going on with her,' Meadows said. 'She is unwilling to admit to these difficulties. She lacks insight into these difficulties. That lack of insight is a major risk factor.' Circuit Judge Leah Case ruled last week that Wilkerson was not guilty by reason of insanity of child abuse, and prosecutors dropped attempted murder charges. The judge must now determine whether Wilkerson should be forcibly hospitalized, released under certain conditions or released with no conditions. Wilkerson ultimately gave birth to her fourth child while she was in prison . Wilkerson, of South Carolina, drove her van into the surf off Daytona Beach, Florida on March 4. One of the children fought with Wilkerson over the steering wheel as the car was entering the water and was able to lower the windows to call rescuers' attention. Bystanders and officers pulled her and her children - aged three, nine and ten, from the van as it was pulled into the waves. Wilkerson, who was pregnant at the time of her arrest, reportedly punched her belly after being taken into custody and had to undergo psychiatric treatment. She gave birth to a boy after her arrest. The child is in the custody of her husband, Lutful Ronjon. Wilkerson's attorneys planned to continue making their case against confinement Wednesday morning. Their presentation was interrupted when one of Wilkerson's attorney, Juliane Morris, fainted at a podium while questioning Danziger. She quickly regained consciousness.","Ebony Wilkerson was ruled not guilty for reason of insanity in the attempted murder of her three children last week .

"It didn't end up quite as badly as the Ferrari in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but a California valet has lost his job this week after being caught taking a brand new Corvette out for a spin - and pushing the car to 50 mph in seconds. Dan Cowles, the owner of the 2015 Chevrolet - which are priced between $60,000 and $70,000 -  dropped his car off at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Costa Mesa on Sunday as he took his wife to see a concert. The attendant who gets in the vehicle decides to take a joy ride around the garage before parking, however Cowles had cleverly activated a new feature called 'Valet Mode'.

Valet Mode records the car when it is in drive from the time the setting is activated to when it is turned off, so owner can see exactly where their car has gone, or have proof if an attendant were to hit something and cause damage. Cowles car was not dented, but the PDR camera captured alot more than he imagined. At one point, in a quiet section of the parking garage, the valet takes the car up to 50 mph. Then, once parking it, about a minute and a half after getting in the car, he steps in front of the Corvette, presumably to ensure he didn't hit the retaining wall in front. The move meant he was captured by the dash cam, effectively identifying himself. 'When he parked the car into the stall, he went out of the car and looked at the front end of the car … I was concerned about damage about the front of the car, but fortunately there was no damage,' Cowles told ABC News. 'You hear stories about valet, you see things in the past and you hope that's an exception and not the norm.' Sleek: The 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray was unveiled in February and costs between $60,000-$70,000 . Clever: Valet Mode records the car when it is in drive from the time the setting is activated to when it is turned off, so owner can see exactly where their car has gone . However, Cowles had further problems when reporting what he discovered to the owner of the valet company. 'The owner called me up yesterday, the first thing he said he spoke to his attorney and told me the video was illegal,"" Cowles said. ""I think my impression was the owner didn’t realize the video was built into the car. 'I informed him this was standard of Corvettes and that as long as audio isn’t recorded in California it’s not illegal.' The owner informed Cowles the valet had been fired for inappropriate behavior. The story has parallels to the pinnacle point of 1986 comedy favorite Ferris Bueller's Day Off starring  Matthew Broderick. Brat pack: In the 1986 blockbuster comedy, directed by John Hughs, Ferris Bueller takes a rare red Ferrari out for a spin - even though it belonged to his friend's father . Classic: The film finishes with the prized Ferrari ending up in a ravine . In the film, Ferris Bueller convinces his friend Cameron to ‘borrow’ his father’s vintage 1962 Ferrari GT California. Director John Hughs said in interviews at the time that there were only 100 of those cars ever produced. In the movie, Cameron is fearful of his father’s retribution after he discovers that they’ve put a few hundred miles on the car’s odometer. In an effort to ‘undo’ the mileage, Bueller suggests that they run the car in reverse. However Cameron kicks the car out of anger, sending it plummeting into a ravine.","Valet at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Costa Mesa has been fired .

"Christian Eriksen can go on to emulate the likes of Paul Gascoigne and Glenn Hoddle at Tottenham Hotspur. That is the opinion of Jan Vertonghen, the man who persuaded the Dane to follow him from Ajax to White Hart Lane in 2013. Eriksen has been outstanding for Spurs this season and was again the star man during Wednesday’s 4-0 victory over Newcastle United in the quarter-final of the Capital One Cup. Christian Eriksen can be as good for Tottenham Hotspur as some club legends, believes Jan Vertonghen . Glenn Hoddle is a Tottenham legend and Vertonghen believes Eriksen can emulate him . Vertonghen also believes Eriksen can be as good for Spurs as Paul Gascoigne was in his prime . The £11million playmaker is still only 22 years old and, having won the club’s Player of the Year prize in his first season, Vertonghen believes his former Ajax team-mate can become a Spurs great. ‘I know the reputation of Hoddle and Gascoigne, I think Christian can be one of the best players of Spurs,’ said the Belgium defender. ‘As a playmaker he can be one of the best in the Premier League. I have played with him since he was 16, 17, for six or seven years now. I think he is improving in every season. ‘In Ajax, near the end, they said his stats weren’t as good as they should be. But I think he shows now that he can score and give assists. Vertonghen (left) shakes hands with Michel Vorm after Spurs' 4-0 victory over Newcastle United . Eriksen holds his arms wide in celebration after scoring Spurs' winner against Swansea City . ‘And he’s a very hard worker, he’s the first on the training pitch and there until the last minute. I am a big fan of him and I’m happy I convinced him to come here.’ Vertonghen joined Spurs 12 months before Eriksen, and he added: ‘We had good contact when he was still at Ajax. We always kept in contact. They asked me what I thought of him, I was very positive. I think I did my job to convince him to come here.’ Eriksen has scored three in his last five league games to take his tally for the season to six and has been at the heart of Spurs’ recent revival under Mauricio Pochettino. Eriksen (right) competes for the ball with Newcastle's Jack Colback (centre) on Wednesday . And Vertonghen believes he is taking more responsibility, especially from a withdrawn role behind striker Harry Kane. ‘He is definitely more dominant now,’ he said. ‘We need him on the ball as much as possible. ‘When he is playing from the left he is coming inside, and when he is playing as a No 10 he has even more influence. When he is on the ball something always happens. It is good for the team.’ Eriksen runs across and congratulates Roberto Soldado after the latter scored Spurs' fourth on Wednesday .","Christian Eriksen starred in Tottenham Hotspur's 4-0 win over Newcastle United in Wednesday's Capital One Cup quarter-final tie .

"More than 220,000 files on immigrants who should have been removed from Britain were found rotting in boxes in back rooms in yet another Home Office scandal. Overall, the number of migrants who are suspected of overstaying their visas has now hit a staggering 263,000. Yet, according to the chief inspector of immigration John Vine, little or no progress is being made in clearing the backlog. Scroll down for video . Home Secretary Theresa May arrived for a cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street in London this morning ahead of a damning report by the chief borders inspector John Vine . The shambles has strong echoes of the 2006 asylum scandal which led to John Reid labelling the Home Office’s immigration and nationality directorate ‘not fit for purpose’. The former home secretary publicly lambasted his own department after 450,000 historic asylum cases were found piled up in boxes. Officials spent years trawling through the cases in a so-called legacy exercise which led to at least 160,000 asylum seekers being granted an effective amnesty to remain. In a further 74,500 cases, the applicants could not be traced. Upon unearthing the debacle, the now Lord Reid damned the Home Office’s immigration operation as ‘not fit for purpose’ with ‘inadequate leadership and management systems’. Since then, the immigration system has undergone a series of shake-ups and re-branding exercises but remains in chaos. A private firm paid £12.7million by the Home Office to improve removals has managed to repatriate less than one per cent of immigrants contacted. Tactics used by Capita included sending text messages which, in many cases, were simply ignored. The latest Vine report – which Theresa May’s Home Office has been sitting on for months – examined the department’s so-called migration refusal pool, or MRP. This contains migrants who, since 2008, have overstayed their visas. Despite ministers promising to clear the backlog, the MRP still contained 173,562 in the three months to June this year, compared to 174,057 in the same period two years earlier. As fast as a case is cleared up, a new one is added. However, in a new debacle, Mr Vine said that he had also been made aware of a further 223,600 records, pre-dating December 2008, which ministers had not previously disclosed. Government sources said the files – which date from the New Labour years, when the immigration system was in chaos – had been found piled up in meeting rooms and cupboards at centres in Sheffield and elsewhere. Incredibly, some documents were found dumped at the bottom of a disused lift shaft, insiders said. John Vine, the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, found the Home Office have lost 174,000 illegal immigrants . The Border Force has only managed to track down 58,000 illegal immigrants who have gone missing . 'Stooge wife': Naima Makda with boyfriend Ibrahim Mahter . BY Andy Dolan . The ringleader of a sham marriage gang used his own girlfriend as a 'stooge wife', marrying her to strangers for £8,000. Ibrahim Mahter, 29, organised a string of lucrative fake ceremonies and 'pressured' women to take part. His girlfriend, Naima Makda, 28, was one of several bogus brides who would marry foreign nationals for £8,000 a time so that they could stay in the UK. Mahter, along with Abdulgani Makrani, 66, paid the women to marry strangers from Pakistan and India, a court heard. Both men, along with Makda and two other fake brides were jailed on Monday after a judge said they had shown 'total disrespect for the institution of marriage and UK immigration laws'. Many of the files contained duplicate records, but among the pre-2008 pool are an estimated 89,000 over-stayers who are still here. Added to the almost 174,000 migrants in post-2008 pool, it gives a total of 263,000 – which is the equivalent of the population of Stoke-on-Trent. While much of the debacle took place under Labour, Coalition efforts to fix the mess have been faltering according to Mr Vine – who last week revealed how the Home Office had been granting citizenship to foreign criminals and illegal immigrants. The Home Office signed a contract with outsourcing giant Capita to review and, where possible, close the records of migrants in the MRP. But the deal – worth a potential £40million – has saved the taxpayer far less than anticipated. In around 60,000 cases, migrants could not even be traced. The inspection also found there were ‘significant inaccuracies’ in Capita’s records – with the number of departures it claimed credit for overstated by more than 1,140 in 2013/14. This represents more than a quarter of Capita’s 4,080 ‘successes’. Last night immigration minister James Brokenshire said: ‘We inherited an immigration system in complete disarray, which turned a blind eye to hundreds of thousands of people with no right to be here.’ Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘To fail to know the whereabouts and precise numbers of thousands who have no right to stay here is a serious indictment of our immigration system. ‘Capita’s contribution has been minimal, but it costs the taxpayer millions. The total of the “disappeared ones” is now the size of a small English city.’ Yvette Cooper, Labour’s home affairs spokesman, said: ‘This report reveals yet another border control failure from Theresa May.’ Capita said it performs only part of the removal process. A spokesman added: ‘It is not contracted to handle, nor able to effect change in the end-to-end process.’","Revelation in report by John Vine, Chief Inspector of Borders .

"The wife of the Sydney siege gunman who is facing charges for alleged murder could have her freedom revoked after the NSW Attorney General demanded a review into the decision to grant her bail. Amirah Droudis, 35, was granted bail by a local court after she was charged with the murder of Man Haron Monis's estranged wife Noleen Hayson Pal in April 2013. Attorney General Brad Hazzard said he has expressed concern to the Director of Public Prosecution over Droudis' bail after two people died when her husband took 18 people hostage in the Lindt cafe at Martin Place on Monday. Scroll down for video . Changed woman: Amirah Droudis, pictured here with friends, used to be known by the traditional Greek name Anastasia prior to her conversion to Islam . Bailed: Droudis is pictured at Campsie Police Station on Tuesday evening, hours after her family's home in Belmore was raided by authorities following her husband's siege . Partygirl: In her youth Anastasia Droudis worked as a hairdresser in the Kings Cross nightclub district . Police allege Droudis stabbed Ms Pal 18 times in her Werrington apartment in western Sydney and set her on fire. Monis was on bail charged with being an accessory to the murder when he entered the Martin Place cafe and took his hostages on Monday. A court was told earlier this year that Droudis and Monis vigorously denied the murder allegations and would plead not guilty. 'The charges laid against Amirah Droudis are extremely serious and her alleged actions involve a murder,' Mr Hazzard said in a statement on Thursday. 'This week I asked the DPP to review any cases where bail had been granted where there may have been any similarity to the circumstances of Man Haron Monis. 'In this case the allegation is that he and she had involvement in the murder of Monis' ex-wife. 'On behalf of our community I want to know whether every aspect of her being on bail has been examined in all possible detail.' NSW Premier Mike Baird said he shared everyone’s rage that Monis was out on bail. 'The public need to know: We have already taken action and strengthened the bail laws. The new, tougher laws come into effect next month. I am advised that these laws would have succeeded where our old laws have failed us,' he said in a statement. 'The advice I have from NSW Police is that the hostage taker did not have a gun license. Questions remain around how he was in possession of a weapon. We will get to the bottom of it. 'I am determined that we will learn from these events. I’ve announced, along with the Prime Minister, that we will be having a full review of the events leading up to the siege. 'I assure you: If we have to do anything more, we will.' Before Droudis married self-styled Sheikh Monis she was known by a different first name - Anastasia, a nod to her Greek heritage. Born to Greek Orthodox migrants who live in Belmore, southwest Sydney, Droudis worked as a hairdresser in Sydney's Kings Cross during her late teenage years. As a young adult, she would often visit bars, drink and party with friends, a source previously close to her told Daily Mail Australia. But after she met the Iranian fanatic in the mid-2000s,  Droudis dropped her birth name in favour for Amirah, an Arabic name, and converted to Islam. 'She's been Anastasia for 30 years,' the source said. 'You can't just turn around and say, 'I'm whatever now''. The source said she became 'influenced' by Monis after the two struck up a relationship following the collapse of her former relationship with her previous partner of eight years. Amirah's brother, John Aspros, told Daily Mail Australia this week that Monis often spent time at the home of Amirah's parents, which was raided by NSW Police officers following the bloody end to the Lindt cafe siege on Tuesday. Droudis declined to comment outside her home this week and later reported to Campsie Police Station where she is required to appear each day as part of her bail conditions. Sydney lawyer Manny Conditsis, who represented Monis and Droudis in court, told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that Droudis was a pleasant client to work with. 'She's always extremely courteous, pleasant,' he said. 'But… it's also fair to observe that she would defer to Monis.' Attorney General Brad Hazzard has expressed concern to the Director of Public Prosecution over Droudis' bail after two people died when her husband took 18 people hostage in the Lindt cafe on Monday . Amirah Droudis remains free despite being charged with serious crimes, including murder . Man Haron Monis, pictured, was the gunman who took 18 hostages and terrified Sydney in a sixteen-hour siege . Droudis declined to comment outside her home this week and later reported to Campsie Police Station where she is required to appear each day as part of her bail conditions. Four years before the alleged murder, a woman believed to be Droudis, posted a series of chilling videos on YouTube in which she described acts of terrorism as God's will. The videos bear the address of Monis' website. 'I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist, but I'll try not to be anymore,' says the woman, 'Amirah', in one of the videos, whose face is mostly covered by a niqab. In another video post, the women describes acts including the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the Bali bombings as 'acts of God.' 'Yes, we are happy about the punishment of September 11. Yes, we are happy about the punishment in Bali. Yes, we are happy about the punishment of the Holocaust and any other punishment that God sends to us.' The video provoked a media storm at the time they were first posted, but no charges were laid. At around the same time both Monis and Droudis were charged with sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed by insurgents in Afghanistan. Relatives said the letters accused the troops of killing innocent children, among other things. Monis and Droudis were eventually convicted and sentenced to community service. In addition to the murder accessory charge, Monis was facing more than 40 sexual assault charges involving seven women that allegedly took place while he posed as a 'spiritual adviser'. Droudis was not involved in that case. Mother: Amirah Droudis is pictured here around a decade ago . Daily Mail Australia understands that Droudis, pictured, worked as a hairdresser in her teenage years .

"Sam Allardyce insists Diafra Sakho will only get a new contract when he and the chairmen decide. Sakho is keen for an improved deal after his blistering start to life at West Ham, despite only signing a four-year contract in the summer. Sakho posted a picture of himself at co-chairman David Sullivan's house during the week as they were discussing the possibility of a better contract. Diafra Sakho (above) has scored eight goals in 11 appearances since signing for West Ham . Sam Allardyce says Sakho will only be offered a new contract if the chairman and him see fit to do so . Allardyce said: 'He doesn't have to have a new contract because he has a four-year contract anyway. 'If he is going to get one, it will be out of the fact that the chairman and ourselves think that we are going to re-adjust the contract he has now. 'I am sure that will be discussed if and when the chairman is ready and whenever the outcome is, he will tell everybody.' The West Ham manager appeared frustrated that his star striker this season would pick the busy festive period to start talking about new terms.

"Police in Spain are investigating the death of a nativity donkey which collapsed after being sat on by a heavyset man. The five-month-old donkey was being held in a pen which was not meant to be accessed by the public for a Christmas fair in the town of Lucena in Cordoba. But one visitor  climbed over the fence and sat on the fragile animal's back to have his picture taken, while grinning and posing for the camera. The photo of the portly man grinning as he poses on the donkey - which later died - has been widely shared on social media, where animal lovers have reacted with outrage and called on the town hall to take action . Two days later, residents noticed that the donkey, named Platero, was barely able to stand, and he was taken to a local vet. The animal was then urgently transferred to a specialist clinic, but due to the severity of his internal injuries he had to be put down. The photograph of the portly man grinning as he poses on the donkey has since been widely shared on social media, where animal lovers have reacted with outrage and called for the town hall to take action. Two animal rights organisations, Asociación de Defensa del Borrico (Adebo) and the Círculo Animalista de Podemos Lucena reported the incident to the police. The donkey was being used in a nativity scene in the town of Lucena in Cordoba, Spain . 'The donkey was literally squashed by a man,' they said in their complaint. 'The man tried to pose 'galloping,' with his almost 150kg of weight on the fragile body of the animal, squashing it to death.' Police have asked a vet to determine the cause of the donkey's death, and the town hall has said it will take legal action if it is found that the man sitting on the animal's back is responsible. The charities say they are repulsed and outraged and will move 'heaven and earth' to have the man prosecuted if it is proved that the man's weight killed the donkey. Traditional nativity scenes, known as 'belenes', are found across towns and cities Spain in the lead-up to Christmas, and often include live animals such as sheep and donkeys.","Five-month-old donkey at a Christmas fair in town of Lucena in Cordoba .

"On Christmas Day, Marie Buchan's eight children will unwrap dozens of gifts each presented to them in a giant sack and then have a festive feast in their new four bed home. Like any parent, their 33-year-old mother, from Birmingham, wants them to have it all and enjoy a perfect Christmas. However, the unemployed single parent hasn't paid for any of it. Their lavish Christmas and new home is all thanks to British taxpayers. Scroll down for video . Determined to spoil them: Single parent Marie Buchan has bought all her children's Christmas gifts with her £2,227 a month benefits . The family receives £2,227 a month in benefits (£26,724 a year). Marie is adamant her children deserve everything they get. 'A lot of people will see this and once they are all wrapped think ""how dare she, she's on benefits and she has all these presents for her kids and we only have two or three for ours because we are working full time and can't afford it"". 'But everyone deserves a Christmas and why should we on benefits not be able to? For my children not to be able to open a present on Christmas day because we're on benefits, it's just not right, there shouldn't be a stigma for that,' she told Channel 5 documentary Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole. But Marie isn't just giving her children one present, she's showering them with gifts even though buying them plunged her into rent arrears. Big family: The young mother is raising Tia, 12, Leah, 11, Latoya, nine, Joshua, eight, Alisha, six, Mikayla, four, Amelia, two, and Olivia, one . Won't miss out: Marie doesn't want the children to have just one present because she's on benefits, so they will each have a sackful - even though buying them meant she missed rent payments . At one point in the show, which airs this evening, she looks at the piles of presents and complains that some of her children don't have enough. 'They are all going to need a lot more,' she said. Her eldest child gets a laptop she bought from a pawn shop. Marie, who has been on benefits since she had her first child at the age of 19, admits she can have trouble controlling her spending. She said: 'When there is a sale on, I'll think I'll order that and that, then at the end of the month I get a £200 bill. A catalogue bill came in this month and I thought, ""if I don't pay it, I'll get charged"" so I missed my rent. I really have to focus on my rent first.' The single mother's relationship with her former partner - and father of all her children - ended last year because he couldn't handle the stress of having so many children. Shop till you drop: The single mother admits she has trouble controlling her spending . Not enough: Looking at this pile of presents for one of her daughters, Marie said she'll need more . So the young mother is raising Tia, 12, Leah, 11, Latoya, nine, Joshua, eight, Alisha, six, Mikayla, four, Amelia, two, and Olivia, one, on her own with their father seeing them at weekends. Thanks to her spending, she racked up £1,000 in rent arrears on their old three bed council house. The rooms are bursting at the seams and Marie said they will need to find space for all the new toys she's bought them this Christmas. She also got a present for herself - who brings some extra chaos to the house - a puppy called Patch. 'I felt broody, I couldn't have another baby so I got a dog,' Marie explains. She added that she would like to work but her dream job is to be a mechanic and she has been told 'it's not for a woman, it's a male world.' Another new arrival: The family now have a puppy because Marie felt broody . Stay at home mother: Marie said she would find it difficult to work without neglecting her brood of eight . With eight children to look after, she also feels she is a better parent as a stay at home mother. She explains: 'If I go back to work doing 12 hours a day it would be positive as I would be at work but the effect on the kids - they would have to go to breakfast club before school, after school club and then not know when I will be home. 'So is it better to work and neglect the kids or be a stay at home mum till the benefits stop?' Marie's festive dreams come true when she discovers towards the end of the programme that they will be given a larger council house with a garden before Christmas - and her previous rent arrears are written off. Tonight's documentary also features Steve and Andy from Nuneaton, who each receive £100 a week on benefits. They admit they spend most of it on drugs and alcohol, so they go through the bins in order to obtain Christmas presents. Upcycling: Addict Steve raids bins to find toys to give away or sell . Steve, pictured with his friend Andy, said it can be difficult to afford heroin on his £100 a week benefits so they look for discarded items to sell . Rooting through a bin, Steve explains: 'The first week of December is the time to get rid of the old toys and get the kids excited about the new toys. This bin is 80 per cent toys, we can give them a good clean with Dettol.' As a heroin addict, Steve said it can be a 'ball ache' finding the money to pay for them on benefits. He said: 'I'm a heroin addict, I have to have to every day. A bag costs £10 and I'm on three a day. 'Somehow it always seems to drop into place and I get what I need. When I get paid, it lasts for a few days, after that I have to go on the graft either by stealling or going through the bins and selling stuff.'

"Former federal MP Craig Thomson has been fined $25,000 for stealing union funds to pay for prostitutes but has avoided going to jail. Thomson, 50, was convicted of 13 counts of theft following cash withdrawals he made from a bank account belonging to the Health Services Union between 2003 and 2007 when he was the union's national secretary. He spent around $5000 of HSU members' fees on escorts and sex workers and lavish meals. In sentencing Thomson on Wednesday, Victorian County Court Judge Carolyn Douglas said his spending had been indulgent and constituted a significant breach of trust. Former federal MP Craig Thomson has been fined $25,000 for stealing union funds to pay for prostitutes but has avoided going to jail . She rejected a submission by Thomson's defence barrister Greg James that the offending was the result of 'the frailties of a man away from home'. One of the charges arose from spending on sexual services while he was at home, and one related to a $400 lunch with his wife that included a $200 bottle of wine. 'The gravity of the offending is the gross breach of trust involved,' Judge Douglas said. 'The seriousness is reflected in the continued confidence, or arrogance, of Mr Thomson in having no regard for the trust placed in him.' She said it was not the concern of the court that he engaged sex workers, but it was the court's concern he was using union members' money to do so. Thomson had appealed against both his 12-month jail sentence and conviction imposed by a Melbourne Magistrate earlier this year . Thomson had appealed against both his 12-month jail sentence and conviction imposed by a Melbourne Magistrate earlier this year. On Monday, he was acquitted of 49 charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception. Judge Douglas said it was regrettable the fraud charges had not been framed correctly and reiterated she would be sentencing on the theft charges only. She said the amount stolen was relatively small but Thomson's behaviour was nonetheless appalling. 'He is greedy,' Judge Douglas said. Judge Carolyn Douglas said it was regrettable the fraud charges had not been framed correctly and reiterated she would be sentencing on the theft charges only . During submissions on Wednesday morning Judge Douglas indicated she was considering a fine instead of jail time, but prosecutor Lesley Taylor QC called for a prison sentence, saying anything less would be manifestly inadequate. 'The moral culpability of Mr Thomson is extremely high,' Ms Taylor said. 'There is not one skerrick of remorse that Mr Thomson has demonstrated.' Mr James said Thomson's theft of $5000 did not warrant jail time and he had been penalised already. Mr James said media coverage of Thomson's legal battle had been 'extensive and intensive' and so intrusive Thomson and his wife had been unable to leave their home. Thomson has had to take out a $300,000 mortgage and sell superannuation assets to fund his defence against the charges, Mr James said. Thomson has three months to pay the $25,000 fine and must also pay compensation of $5650.","Former federal MP Craig Thomson has been fined $25,000 for misuse of union funds .
