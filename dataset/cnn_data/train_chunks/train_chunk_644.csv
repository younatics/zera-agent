Kevin Wright, 49, was found guilty of theft and fraud after stealing from funds for children with cancer including his own son, Bobby . A man has been found guilty of stealing tens of thousands of pounds from a fund he set up to raise money for the treatment of children with cancer, including his own son. Kevin Wright bowed his head in the dock as a jury of seven women and five men found him guilty of 10 counts of theft and two of fraud after a trial lasting more than five weeks. Wright stole a total of £171,500 from the Bobby Wright Cancer Fighting Fund, including donations of £60,000 made by charities Caudwell Children and Janet Nash. He set up the fund to raise money for treatment for his son Bobby after he was diagnosed with neuroblastoma - a rare form of cancer - at the age of three in 2005. His son is now 11 and cancer-free. Wright, 49, from Quince, near Tamworth in Staffordshire, also stole cash and credit balances from appeals he set up to raise money for cancer treatment for youngsters Callum Kaye, aged three, and Armani Mohammad, also three. The money went into Wright's personal bank account to fund his 'interests, investments and personal lifestyle', Nottingham Crown Court heard. Jurors heard Wright, who lived in Kenn near Exeter before moving to Staffordshire, gave £20,000 to a friend who ran a used-car business and that he put £60,000 into Premium Bonds. Another £30,000 was used to buy the Toad in the Hole restaurant in Exeter, while a further £30,000 was invested in the Royal Oak pub in a village close to his home. Wright claimed the restaurant and pub ventures were aimed at promoting natural food and were part of the fundraising, with any profits going back into the appeal funds. Asked why any promotional material did not mention cancer, Wright told the court: 'Who would want to go and eat in a cancer-themed restaurant? 'It's not going to pull people in, it's going to drive them away.' After a five week trial at Nottingham Crown Court, Mr Wright was found guilty of theft and fraud. He will be sentenced next month . Wright set up a number of appeals for other children with cancer. He advised their parents to feed their child an organic diet as this had helped his son Bobby to overcome cancer. The mother of one child who was diagnosed with a brain tumour wept as she told the court she was never made aware of the amount Wright raised for her son. Wright set up Callum's Appeal to raise money for treatment for Callum Kaye, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2005. Giving evidence, Callum's mother Anna Kaye told jurors Wright gave her advice about organic food and supplements, and told her about life-saving treatment at a US hospital. However when they visited the hospital, doctors said the treatment was not appropriate for Callum. Following the trip in December 2008, she told Wright she no longer felt comfortable fundraising for her son as he wasn't going to be treated in the US. But she told the court Wright said they should 'keep going until the end of the year'. Giving evidence in his defence, Wright told the jury that every penny he raised was intended to help youngsters living with cancer. After Bobby, who is now aged 11 and cancer-free, responded well to a variety of holistic and natural therapies, he said he wanted to help others in a similar situation. Wright was found guilty of 10 counts of theft and two of fraud by false representation. He was cleared of one count of fraud by false representation. Following the verdicts, Judge Greg Dickinson told the court Wright had two previous convictions for theft and another for forgery. Wright will be sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court on September 5.","Kevin Wright, 49, of Tamworth convicted of 12 counts of theft and fraud .

When these homeowners decided to spruce up their 'shabby' Grade II listed home with a lick of paint, they probably thought that their neighbours would appreciate their efforts. But Ann Kennedy and her husband Mark have learned the perils of a little DIY, after council officials ordered them to repaint their entire property because it is too pink. The couple insist that their 17th Century thatched cottage is exactly the same colour today as it was when they bought it 12 years ago. Ann Kennedy insists that her 17th Century thatched cottage is exactly the same colour today as it was when they bought it 12 years ago . Before the £1,000 paint job had even dried officials arrived threatening legal action unless the 'unauthorised' work was re-done in a subtler hue . However, town planners at Teignbridge District Council disagreed and ordered them to tone down their pink paintwork after a complaint from a neighbour. The row began in November 2011 after the couple's neighbours repainted their homes and they followed suit, giving their three-bedroom cottage a fresh new look. They looked back at photos of their property from 2001, when they bought it for £130,000, and settled on a similar shade. But before the £1,000 paint job had even dried officials arrived threatening legal action unless the 'unauthorised' work was re-done in a more subtle hue. Retired dance teacher Ann, 64, who has three grown-up children, applied for retrospective planning permission from Teignbridge District Council. This picture shows the cottage's condition when Ann and Mark Kennedy bought it 12 years ago . But the authority has denied her request and instead given the couple of Kennford, Devon, three years to repaint the entire house. Ann said: 'Everyone else had had their houses painted and ours was looking rather shabby. So we repainted it in its original colour - pink. 'Before the paint was even dry we had the council knocking on the door saying we had to change the colour. They said it wasn't in keeping with the area. 'I think they're totally wrong. It's a beautiful colour and it's been like that ever since we moved here 12 years ago.' The council insisted consent must be obtained before any alterations are made to a listed building that are likely to affect its character or appearance. A spokesman said: 'Teignbridge District Council's Planning Committee refused a retrospective application for the painting of a Grade Two listed cottage in Kennford. 'The cottage was white but was painted a pale pink 13 years ago. In November 2011 it was repainted a bright pink colour by the current cottage owner. 'It is this shade which is the subject of this decision.'","Ann and Mark Kennedy decided to paint their 17th Century thatched cottage .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 19:20 EST, 12 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:01 EST, 13 August 2013 . David Cameron and George Osborne have almost doubled their lead over Labour for stewardship of the economy. According to a survey, 40 per cent believe the Prime Minister and Chancellor are more capable of managing the economy than Ed Miliband and Ed Balls. Just 24 per cent said the Labour leader and Shadow Chancellor have the right answers – giving the Tories a 16 per cent lead. Economic competence: The Tory lead over Labour for running the economy has soared from nine points in June to 16 points in August . PM David Cameron, left, and Chancellor George . Osborne, right, have seen a sharp rise in their economic credibility, . according to the survey . It is a dramatic increase from a lead of just nine points last month, and will send shockwaves through the Labour party as Mr Miliband prepares for another relaunch. From April to June the economy grew by 0.6 per cent, double the 0.3 per cent seen in the first quarter of 2013. New Bank of England governor Mark Carney last week raised growth forecasts for this year from 1.2 per cent to 1.4 per cent and for next year from 1.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Senior Tories have been careful not to declare they can see ‘green shoots’ of recovery, with Mr Osborne insisting the economy has moved only from ‘repair to recovery’. With growth up and unemployment down, Labour has been forced to re-rite its attacks on the government, having previously accused ministers of cutting ‘too far, too fast’. Mr Miliband's frontbench have instead claimed that the recovery is only being enjoyed by the wealthy. But the new message has done nothing to stop voters swinging in behind the Tory leadership’s economic strategy. According to the latest ICM survey for the Guardian, the Conservative lead for ‘competence’ on the economy is at its highest level since December 2012. Pressure: After three weeks of almost complete silence from the Labour leadership, the poll will be another blow for Ed Miliband and Ed Balls (right) To make things worse for Labour, the same survey shows that while the party is ahead overall, it is only just. On voting intentions Mr Miliband’s party leads by just 3 per cent, with 35 per cent saying they will vote Labour compared with 32 per cent for the Conservatives. Factoring in the margin of error – of plus or minus 3 per cent – shows that the lead may in fact be non-existent. The Tories have fallen four points over the last month and Labour has gone down 1 per cent. The poll is the latest blow for Mr Miliband, who is expected to return to the political fray this week with an attack on the government for falling wages in real terms. He has faced criticism for three weeks of all but total silence from his frontbench, leaving the coalition to set the political agenda. A much-hyped speech on immigration by frontbencher Chris Bryant turned into a fiasco when large sections attacking Tesco and Next had to be rewritten after the retail giants hit back at errors in pre-briefed extracts. Gordon Brown's former pollster Deborah Mattinson said the speech was ‘symptomatic of a bigger problem’ for Labour - ‘an apparent lack of an overarching strategy’. ‘It seemed to be a tactical opportunity seized - rightly or wrongly - rather than something that's part of a bigger story from Labour, and I think what we need is to hear the bigger story, and that's what we're not really getting at the moment,’ she told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight. She warned that Labour was ‘slightly lurching from one announcement to the next, or complete silence’. ‘What voters need to hear is some real clarity about what Labour stands for, what Labour believes, how Labour now would be different from how Labour has been before. And that needs to be set out with absolute clarity in a language that people understand. ‘I don't buy the argument that we need to hold all our important announcements back because I think we're leaving it to the point that people have so little to go on about Labour that they're almost not noticing Labour, and the party has to define itself very clearly now to people or it will be defined by its opponents.’ The ICM poll shows UKIP has seen its rating rise from 7 to 10 per cent. The poll also shows 17 per cent of people think their personal financial circumstances have improved in the last year, compared to 43 per cent who say it has become worse. A quarter believed their situation would improve in the next year.","Just 24% said Labour leader and Shadow Chancellor have the answers .

Alice Miller, 23, met Tom Staniford, 24, online and says that they ‘clicked instantly’ and are now living together in London. Mr Staniford is one of only eight people in the world with MDP syndrome, which means that since the age of 12 he has been unable to store fat under his skin or even on the soles of his feet. Scroll down for video . Alice Miller, 23, met Tom Staniford, 24, online and says that they 'clicked instantly' and are now living together in London. Mr Staniford is a para-cyclist who is hoping to representing GB in the 2016 Olympics . He also has just 40 per cent of the muscles of an average man and has poor hearing. Surprisingly, Mr Staniford also suffers from type 2 diabetes - a disease usually associated with obesity. Miss Miller, who works for custom bike experts CycleFit, travelled from Sheffield, where she was then a student, all the way to Mr Staniford’s hometown, Exeter, for their first date. She said: ‘We had clicked instantly online, he was so easy to talk to. He told me about his condition and I’d seen a few pictures of him but I didn’t really know what he really looked like until I met him in person. ‘I remember being worried - like any first date - but I wanted an adventure. ‘It was odd to see him in real life. His appearance did take me by surprise and he was much taller than I had expected.’ Mr Staniford is one of only eight people in the world with MDP syndrome, which means that since the age of 12 he has been unable to store fat under his skin or even on the soles of his feet . Mr Staniford also has just 40 per cent of the muscles of an average man and has poor hearing meaning that he has to wear hearing aids . She added: ‘Initially, I was . self-conscious because people were staring at Tom but he didn’t let it . bother him and he instantly put me at ease. ‘He was so friendly and we talked for hours over a meal at the local pub. It was just like any normal first date.’ Miss Miller says the pair are just like any normal couple - apart from the fact that they don’t go clubbing or out for late night drinking sessions. Mr Staniford explained: ‘I don’t like walking and I can’t stand for long periods because of my condition. Even without it, though, I don’t think I’d be very good at clubbing. I’m a professional athlete so need to keep healthy.’ Surprisingly, Mr Staniford also suffers from type 2 diabetes - a disease usually associated with obesity - because he has unusually high fat levels in his blood . Ms Miller says that she was self-conscious when she first started going out with Mr Staniford because people would stare at him but that he soon put her at ease with his friendly conversation . Scientists at the University of Exeter have recently discovered that Mr Staniford’s condition stems from a genetic mutation. The new discovery may, in time, help other sufferers with the syndrome. However, the six foot three inch tall cyclist, who weighs 66 kilos, says he has never let his condition hold him back. And he has already proved that it is possible to live a normal life. The law graduate has already been crowned the British National Para-Cycling Circuit Race Champion and dreams of winning gold at the Paralympics in Rio 2016. Ms Miller says the pair are just like any normal couple - apart from the fact that they don't go clubbing or out for late night drinking sessions because Mr Staniford has to concentrate on his cycling career . Ms Miller said: ‘Living with Tom I’ve had to learn about what he eats. He has to have a controlled diet because of his diabetes and metabolism. ‘But that’s about it - he does most of the cooking and shopping and I just go along to pick out the cakes.’ She says they’ve been together long enough to know each other inside out. She said: ‘When I look in to my future I see Tom there. We’ve been together so long that we know each other’s strengths and weaknesses and I don’t think there would ever be anything that would get in the way of that. Mr Staniford (right, at the age of nine) recently learned that his condition stems from a genetic mutation thanks to a breakthrough by scientists at Exeter University . ‘Now I don’t even notice the stares we occasionally get when we go out - Tom isn’t out of the ordinary at all.’ Mr Staniford added: ‘I am very, very fortunate to have Alice. That’s all I can say really. I’m very lucky to have her.’ The cyclist was born at a normal weight, but throughout his childhood and teenage years lost all the fat around his face and limbs. His condition means he has no natural cushioning on his body, suffers from sore feet, and is at an increased risk of breaking bones in a fall. Mr Staniford (pictured at the age of five) was born at a normal weight, but throughout his childhood and teenage years lost all the fat around his face and limbs . Because of the disorder, Tom has unusually high fat levels in his blood, as if he was obese. It is this that has led to him developing diabetes. His hearing also deteriorated during childhood, and he now wears hearing aids. Tom hopes the new diagnosis will allow him to be more accurately classified for events and help his chances of success. He is bidding to participate in the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games. He said: 'In some ways, identifying the syndrome behind my symptoms shouldn't be important - a name is just a name, after all - but it is reassuring to know that there are other people with the condition and that we can lead relatively normal lives,' he said. Ms Miller said: 'When I look in to my future I see Tom there. We've been together so long that we know each other very well. I don't think there would ever be anything that would get in the way of that' ‘What could prove crucial, though, is enabling me to be properly classified in competitions so that I am not competing at an unfair disadvantage against others. 'I hope to be able to compete for Great Britain in the 2016 Paralympics and this finding could make a real difference to my chances.' Professor Andrew Hattersley, a Wellcome Trust senior investigator, said: 'Tom's condition has been a puzzle to us for many years. We could see the symptoms, including the very unusual case of type 2 diabetes in someone with no obvious body fat, but did not know what was causing them. 'We had to look at 30 million base pairs (chemical components of DNA) in Tom's DNA, and similar numbers in his family members and other patients, to identify the single mutation. This would not have been feasible even a couple of years ago.'","Alice Miller, 23, is in a relationship with para-cyclist Tom Staniford, 24 .

The parents of a 12-year-old Florida boy infected with a 'brain-eating amoeba' are praying for a miracle, with the help of pastors and residents gathering for a prayer vigil. Zachary Reyna remains in Miami Childen's Hospital while fighting for his life after developing the rare infection caused by an amoeba attacking and eating his brain. The family have been gathering at the hospital to pray and yesterday the boy's uncle, Daniel Reyna, said they've created a Facebook page and hashtag in his honor, 'pray4number4'. Fighter: Zachary Reyna is in intensive care after contracting a rare infection from a deadly amoeba . Risks: Zachary is being treated in hospital, above, for an infection only three people are known to have survived . The page has information on how to donate and already has over 5,000 likes. On Wednesday morning, five pastors and hundreds of residents met at LaBelle Veteran's Memorial Park for the vigil. Donations were taken by organizer Susan Whidden, who lives in the area and works at Seacoast National Bank, on behalf of the family, The Miami Herald reported. A local LaBell resident, Mr Bares, told the Herald: 'When something happens close to home we really come together. That's why I love living in a small town.' Zachary Reyna fell critically ill after playing on a knee board with friends in a ditch near his LaBelle, Florida home on August 3rd. If he recovers from the infection caused by the brain-eating amoeba he will be only the four person to have survived. The single cell Naegleria Fowleri or brain-eating amoeba, lives in warm fresh water and attacks the brain after entering the body through the nose, according to Naples News. A Facebook page has been set up for Zachary Reyna, named pray4number4, to help raise donations . Vigil: The family of the 12-year-old, pictured with his sister, are staying by his bedside. He became sick after playing in a ditch with friends . Doctors don't know why some people . who swim in amoeba-containing water become infected in their nervous . system, while others don't. In the past 50 years only 31 have contracted the rare primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (Pam) infection, and only three have survived so far. 'He can be number four. That's what we're hoping for, for him to be number four,' Zachary's brother, Brandon Villarreal, said. The . family first noticed there was something seriously wrong with Zachary . after he slept for a whole day after playing with friends on August 3. At . first they thought he had a 24 hour virus, but soon realized there was . something seriously wrong with the usually active, baseball loving . child. 'I wish I could just touch him and it would transfer over. It don't work like that,' Brandon told ABC7. 'It's just tough to see him like this.' Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific. It is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim's brains - usually when infected water shoots up their nose. The amoeba grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm, stagnant water and is most active at about 85F. The water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans. Health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the United States in the past 50 years. Only two people have survived in the U.S. One other survivor was found in Mexico . Swimmers can reduce their risk by: . The family have been keeping a vigil by his bedside at Miami Children's Hospital, where Zachary has been sedated. '[It] . will actually eat away at the tissue; it literally eats the tissues,' Dr Mark Heulitt told KATV. 'It is a severe form of meningitis where your . brain will be eaten by the amoeba.' Brandon is positive that his little brother, who loves to play baseball, will pull through. 'He's fighting and he's strong, he's really, really strong,' he said. Swimmers have been warned to be careful in still water around Florida, as health officials try to prevent further infections. The amoeba is common in warm, stagnant water in central Florida, especially in the summer. Health officials have advised swimmers and water skiers to wear nose clips as a safety precaution because it cuts off the only way the amoeba can enter the body and do damage. A Department of Health spokesman told MailOnline the water must to be forcefully, almost violently, pushed up the nose - as it can be after diving into the water, being dunked or using a water slide. Three boys, aged between 10 and 14, developed the infection last year after wakeboarding or swimming. Mark Zeitler, whose nephew of Will Sellers, who died from the infection last year, has warned people to stay away from water in the summer. 'We're not trying to be alarmists, but . as that water heats up, find other places to recreate,' Mr Zeitler told . the Orlando Sentinel. Warning signs: Zachary's family realized he was sick when the usually active child could not stop sleeping . It can take up to a week for the infection to show symptoms, which include headaches, fever, vomiting and seizures. A 12-year-old girl who developed the condition in July is still in hospital after managing to fight off the infection. Kali Hardig came in contact with the amoeba as she swam in a sandy bottom lake at Willow Springs Water Park near Little Rock, Arkansas.","A Facebook page has been set up to help with donations, named pray4number4 .

Many car enthusiasts dream of owning an Aston Martin, not many go to the trouble of building one. Ivan Sentch, 32, from Auckland, New Zealand, is printing hundreds of plastic parts that fit together to form a 1961 Series II Aston Martin DB4. It is an earlier, but very similar model to the one made famous by James Bond. Labour of love: Computer programmer Ivan Sentch is using 3D technology to print a full-sized Aston Martin . Attention to detail: The distinctive shape of the 1961 Series II Aston Martin DB4 frame is 72 per cent finished so far after work began in December 2012 . Precise work: Much of the body's core structure is already completed, after carefully assembling 2,500 plastic parts . Each piece is 'printed', then mounted onto a wood frame and glued into . place. With 2,500 sections printed, he is currently 72 per cent of the . way finished. Sentch estimates it will take another five years until he can actually take . the car on the road. His blog, Replica DB4 Project, has chronicled the ambitious . project since he started it in his garage and it now has . an international following. It would be virtually impossible for the married father-of-two to buy an original DB4. Taking shape: Sentch plans to use the body he is currently printing to create a mould, which will then be used for the body of the DB4 replica . Plastic print-out: Sentch has no previous experience with 3D printing but the results so far have been very impressive . Painstaking: Sentch has been mounting the individual pieces onto the wooden frame and then gluing each piece into place . Humble beginnings: Sentch started from scratch, without even knowing how to use the 3D printing software . There are only 1,200 DB4 models in existence, and they often fetch around £220,000 at auction. They were only manufactured between September 1961 and October 1962, making them a very rare commodity. The outline he is creating now will be used to make a fibreglass mould which will be used to form a custom-built frame which will be the actual car. Sentch has no previous experience with 3D printing but he has learned how to use the software as he goes along. Progress: Sentch only started in December but reckons it will be roadworthy in the next five years . The goal: An Aston Martin DB4, which are rarely available to buy even at auction . Once the plastic print-out is finished and painted, he thinks it will be as close to an original sleek, stylish classic sports car as you could get. 'It will be seriously cool. I want to use it for my everyday car,' Sentch said. He estimates his plastic cost about £1,300 so far - not bad for a dream car.","Aston Martin devotee Ivan Sentch is building himself a classic DB4 .

We all like to think we would be a hero in a crisis – but research shows that most people would run a mile. And the meek, sensing injustice, are more likely to respond rather than the brash and self confident. Tests on students in Germany found they all insisted they would react but only 26 per cent – mostly quieter personalities – did intervene when they saw a mobile phone being ‘stolen’ in a stunted scene six months later. Meek people, sensing injustice, are more likely to respond rather than the brash and self confident when witnessing a crime (file picture) The report – published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin – concluded: ‘Participants appear to overestimate their moral courage when responding to vignettes.’ Dr Cynthia McVey, of Glasgow Caledonian University, said: ‘The results emphasise a basic Christian tenet that the meek shall inherit the Earth.’ Every student in the test claimed they would intervene, with the strongest reactions coming from those who believe themselves to be strong characters . Academics from Koblenz-Landau University . in Germany gathered together 65 students who sat character assessments . and then, six months later, were recalled and asked how they would react . if they saw a theft. The imagined scenario involved the witness sitting in a laboratory waiting for another female student to arrive so a test can start. A staff member reveals that a mobile phone lying on a nearby table belongs to someone who is returning to retrieve it that evening. The missing student then arrives and, when the tester leaves the room for a moment, the woman reaches across and pockets the phone. Every witness claimed they would intervene, with the strongest reactions coming from those who believe themselves to be strong characters, socially confident and unfazed by the status of others. Researchers then repeated the experiment with 68 different students - though this time they enacted the crime as if for real. Only 18 people – 26 per cent – intervened and continued to protest, bringing the matter to the attention of the member of staff when he returned to the lab. Just one personality trait was found to be significant in the heat of the moment: a sensitivity to seeing a third party unfairly disadvantaged.","Students in Germany all insisted they would react to witnessing crime .

Alex Wein's idea for his latest photography project was simple - so simple he did it standing on his head. The 23-year-old turned the art of self-portrait upside-down with pictures from his road trip - doing headstands across America. The photographer from Baltimore, Maryland, U.S., went topsy-turvy from the edge of the . Grand Canyon to the deserts of Utah to produce a playful portrait . collection that sees him observing the world from upside down. Head over heels: Alex Wein said his Grand Canyon was the 'craziest' of his headstand locations . Footloose: The photographer threw caution to the wind when he performed the stunt in the middle of the road on the Memphis and Arkansas Bridge . Fresh perspective: The pictures were taken on a road trip around some of the most stunning sites in America, such as Monument Valley in Utah . Mr Wein came up with the idea after he spotted a girl doing a headstand in a park in San Francisco. He was at the park with a group of friends from Brighton, UK, the day before they were due to set off on a road trip around America. Despite a painstaking lesson from the girl and hours trying to master the stunt, Mr Wein just couldn't do it. But he refused to stand around and be ridiculed by his friends, and when they made their first stop on the road trip he tried again. He was thrilled when he finally mastered it - and celebrated by continuing to perform headstands throughout their three-week trip and asking his friends to photograph him. And as these images show, Mr Wein performed the precarious balancing act in a skate park, a cemetery, in the middle of the road and even on the edge of a cliff. Mr Wein said: 'I'd tried for hours to do a headstand in the park that day but for the life of me I just couldn't do it. Spot the skateboard: Alex Wein set up unusual shots in some more mundane locations, such as this picture from Kona Skatepark in Jacksonville, Florida . Head over heels: Mr Wein was inspired by the photographic potential of this fallen roof in Harford County, Maryland . Top of the world: Alex Wein's friends stood on hand to take this picture of him on the edge of King and Queen's Seat, Rocks, Maryland . Headstone: Lafayette Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana, provided the backdrop for this shot . Feet of clay: The lap of this Buddha statue in the Sculpture Garden of the Maryland Institute College of Art became another perfect headrest . Road stand: Shabby Madeira Street in Baltimore, Maryland, inspired the young photographer to take this artistic headstand shot . Headland: Presumably no cars came along this deserted-looking road in Marin, California, while Alex Wein was taking his photograph . 'I was so determined to do it so when I finally did, I was so excited. 'It became a bit of a joke for me for me to do a headstand everywhere we stopped. 'I'd read about other self-portrait projects where people had taken photos of themselves across America, so when I finally managed the headstand it seemed like a great idea to use that as an idea for my next project. 'We were on the road for around three weeks we went from San Francisco to LA, South West Utah, along the Gold Coast to the Grand Canyon, Florida, Alabama and finished in Baltimore. 'I'd do a headstand picture every day of the trip, sometimes I'd do two or three a day it really depended on our surroundings. If the landscape changed a lot that day I'd usually do more than one picture. 'We were at the mercy of the landscape really. I'd always look for the most unusual locations and the edge of the Grand Canyon was definitely the craziest. Upside-dune: The incredible inland White Sands in the Tularosa Basin, New Mexico, made a soft cushion at this stop on Alex Wein's journey . Head banger: A quick musical interlude at a piano at Wild Horses Studio gave Alex Wein the chance to mix his photo series up a bit . Head of state: Alex Wein takes his stunt to the Capitol in Washington DC . Head of the river: Alex Wein did another headstand when he visited Ninth Ward, New Orleans, Louisiana, along the Mississippi . Headstand tall: Alex Wein straightened up next to the trees in Springwood, Maryland . 'The road trip was in 2012 but the project is still going if I spot somewhere cool I just have to do a headstand and get someone to take my picture. 'Sometimes I'm on my own and I ask a member of the public to take my photo. 'They just think I want a normal tourist photo, so they're pretty shocked when I suddenly do a headstand, it can be quite funny.'","Photographer creates series of upside-down self-portraits .

From spilt cups of tea to being dropped from on high, many a parents' mobile phone has fallen victim to adventurous children. But one new handset - the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active - claims to be waterproof, dustproof and even childproof. The company is said to have designed the phone, which is a toughened version of its current S4 handset, specifically for parents to avoid accidents and damage caused by youngsters. Scroll down for video . Samsung's latest handset, the Galaxy S4 Active, claims to be waterproof, dustproof and even childproof. The company is said to have designed the phone, which is a toughened version of its current S4 handset, specifically for parents to avoid accidents and damage caused by little fingers . Dimensions: 139.7 x 71.3 x 9.1 mm . Weight: 153g . Dust and water resistant: up to 1 metre and 30 minutes . Operating system: Android 4.2.2 . Camera: 8MP rear-facing, 2MP front-facing . Chipset: Qualcomm APQ8064T Snapdragon 600 . CPU: Quad-core 1.9 GHz Krait 300 . Internal memory: 16 GB with 2GB RAM . However, the handset's warranty doesn't . cover damage caused by accidents, misuse, water damage, defects caused . by 'sand or dirt', or 'neglect'. The S4 Active costs £480. It was announced in May, but officially went on sale earlier this month. Samsung calls it 'the perfect companion for exploration, activity and adventure'. It has been designed to stay underwater for up to 30 minutes and take pictures with a waterproof camera. The handset additionally comes with a water-resistant headphone jack and is inside a sealed case to keep out dust. Its LCD screen has a Glove Touch component that means it can be used with gloves, too. Luke Mansfield, head of Samsung's Europe innovation team told The Times the phone was designed with parents in mind. He said: 'We know a lot of parents use their phones to show children content. We ended up going to a lot of family homes where we were shown a graveyard of smashed phones.' Yet despite Samsung's durability claims, the warranty that comes with the phone doesn't cover certain types of damage the phone was designed to protect against. First discovered by VentureBeat, the warranty in the phone's user manual claims: 'This Limited Warranty does not cover: (a) defects or damage resulting from accident, misuse, abnormal use, abnormal conditions, improper storage, exposure to liquid, moisture, dampness, sand or dirt, neglect, or unusual physical, electrical or electromechanical stress.' The S4 Active, pictured, costs £480. It has been designed to stay underwater for up to 30 minutes and can take pictures with a waterproof camera. The handset is a toughened version of Samsung's S4 handset and is inside a sealed case to keep out sand and dust . According to the phone's how-to guide, users must also correctly cover the USB ports and claims the phone should not be used underwater until these steps have been taken. The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is a direct competitor for Sony's Xperia Z, released in January, that has an 'anti-shatter film' on the screen, and is also water resistant up to one metre and 30 minutes. In May, the first mobile phone designed for four to nine-year-olds was launched by OwnFone. The 1stFone was dubbed 'dumbphone for smart parents' and is the size of a credit card and weighs 40g. It can only make and receive calls, and it doesn't have a screen - instead it has the names of up to 12 close friends and family shown in a list with corresponding physical buttons. The latest model from OwnFone, released this week, replaces this list of contacts with photos of each contact. Despite Samsung's durability claims, the handset's warranty doesn't cover damage caused by accidents, misuse, water damage, defects caused by 'sand or dirt', or 'neglect'. The phone's user manual explains the S4 Active is only water-resistant if the USB ports, pictured, are all properly closed .","The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active has been designed with parents in mind .

Heroin abuse in the U.S. has skyrocketed in the last five years, and a large share of new users are 18- to 25-year-olds living in suburban or rural environments. The death of clean-cut Glee star Cory Monteith in July of a heroin overdose shocked fans and shone a spotlight on the new generation of addicts. Often thought of as the habit of inner-city junkies that faded after its mid-nineties heyday, heroin use is experiencing a terrifying resurgence. Shock: Fans of Glee were horrified when the clean-cut star of the show, Cory Monteith, was found dead in a hotel room of a mixture of heroin and alcohol toxicity . The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services . Administration (SAMHSA), documented an alarming 80 percent increase in . first use of heroin among 12- to 17-year-olds since 2002. Over the past five years, seizures of heroin in the United States by the Drug Enforcement Administration have gone up more than 50 per cent, from 1,334 lbs in 2008 to 2,059 lbs in 2012. Heroin use in the U.S. rose an alarming 75 per cent between 2007 and 2011, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. And with heroin use comes heroin overdose. Caroline Kacena of Naperville, Illinois, lost her son, John, to a heroin overdose on July 23 2012. He was 20 years old. 'He told me he was doing heroin for four months before he knew it was heroin,' his mother Caroline Kacena told CBS. Suburban teen: John Kacena grew up playing hockey and baseball and was a Boy Scout, before he turned to heroin . 'We were the quintessential American family - baseball, hockey, Boy Scouts,' she said. 'I worked at the local school, so it allowed me to be at home with my kids. I had my summers off. So I did everything right. I did everything I was supposed to.' Heroin most often kills by causing respiratory failure. An overdoes causes the breathing to slow, and eventually stop entirely. This effect is especially . Public health experts link the surge in heroin abuse to the . over-prescription of highly addictive pain medications such as Vicodin . and Oxycontin, which act as gateway drugs. A recent survey by DrugFree.org shows one in four high school students have abused prescription pain medications like Vicodin and Oxycontin, up 33 per cent in just five years. The widespread abuse of ­prescription painkillers has been on the radar of public health officials and law enforcement officials for years. In 2009, 257 million prescriptions for opioid painkillers - derived from the opium poppy, like heroin - were dispensed nationwide, almost one per person, according to a 2011 White House report. According to the Center for Disease Control, there has been at least a 10-fold increase in the medical use of opioid painkillers during the last 20 years because of a movement toward more aggressive management of pain. The euphoric effect associated with opioids has led to misuse and abuse of the widely available drugs. New generation: Cory Monteith joined a long line of tragic heroin-overdose deaths among young and talented people, including River Phoenix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison . In 2007, the number of deaths involving opioid analgesics was 1.93 times the number involving cocaine and 5.38 times the number involving heroin. Pill-popping: Data shows that legal pain medications such as Oxycontin are gateway drugs for heroin . Cory Monteith’s battle with drug addiction began, like so many heroin addicts, in his teen years. Monteith underwent rehabilitation for heroin addiction as a 19-year-old, south treatment again in April of this year. Susan Foster, vice president of CASAColumbia, a substance-abuse research center at Columbia University in New York told the Christian Science Monitor that 95 per cent of addictions start with substance abuse in the teen years. In 2010 Purdue Pharma brought a new, more difficult to abuse form of Oxycontin onto the market. The pill could no longer be crushed for snorting or dissolved for injecting, and took longer to act. The demand for prescription painkillers meant that their street value went way up, to up to $80 a tablet, according to law enforcement agency data. On the other hand, heroin costs just $10 a bag. In a study published in 2012 by the New England Journal of Medicine, 66 per cent of Oxycontin addicts moved on to heroin after the reformulation of the drug. John . Kacena and his friends grew up close, playing baseball, hockey and . joining the scouts together. They began using heroin together in their . freshman year of high school. At the time of his death, Kacena had been clean for a few weeks and had spoken about going to college. 'I woke up in the morning,' Kacena told CBS of the July day John Kacena died. Cheap habit: In contrast to prescription painkillers, a bag of heroin has a street value of about $10 . 'I opened up his door. And I found my son sitting up in his bed, cross-legged, but slumped completely over. I could tell the moment I opened up the door by the position that he was in that he was already gone.' Caroline Kacena has been lobbying for changes that could help save someone else's son or daughter. Kacena wants a nationwide 'Good Samaritan law' that would mean anyone with a person who's overdosing could call 911 without fear of arrest. Another change Kacena is calling for is to make Naloxone, a drug that can neutralize the effect of heroin and avert an overdose, available over-the-counter. Public health officials hope the reigning-in of prescription drugs will prevent future addiction and consequent shift to heroin use. In the meantime, a new generation of heroin addicts has emerged, and only time will tell what their futures hold.","Heroin use has increased alarmingly over the last five years .

There is already legislation in this area. 'Bullies mistakenly believe that because the abuse they inflict is happening online, it is beyond the reach of the law. 'I am very clear that it is not and the police should investigate it as they would any other crime.' It was reported that the Government is giving teachers powers to search for and delete images and files on children's mobile phones. Mr Cameron also reportedly told Mr Smith that MPs were 'working with industry' so parents can 'install internet filters for devices in the home'. Mr Smith said: 'We need the law to change so sites can't operate if they don't have correct measures in place.'

'Jerk': The change follows a ruling that France violated a demonstrator's freedom of expression when he referred to Nicolas Sarkozy with the word . Being rude to the President of France is no longer an automatic criminal offence, France’s parliament agreed today. In the interests of free speech, MPs revoked legislation dating back to 1881 when anything judged to have ‘offended the head of state’ risked an automatic fine. The change followed the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruling in March that France violated a demonstrator’s right to freedom of expression when he referred to Nicolas Sarkozy as a ‘jerk’. Mr Sarkozy, the notoriously aggressive . 5ft 5ins conservative, became the butt of numerous jokes during his . five years in office, which ended last year. But . when a demonstrator held up a placard reading ‘Get Lost Jerk’ at a . Sarkozy meeting in western France in 2008, he received a criminal . conviction and a fine of around 25 pounds. This . was despite exactly the same expression being used by Sarkozy himself . months earlier while he was attending an agricultural show in Paris. Last . year ECHR deemed the punishment handed down to Sarkozy’s tormentor as . being disproportionate and a violation of freedom of expression, as the . act was a ‘satirical remark.’ The . ECHR acknowledged that the insult constituted ‘criticism of a political . nature’ for which ‘freedom of expression was of the highest . importance.’ Now anyone who chooses to insult a serving French president will have to be pursued through the libel courts. Francois . Hollande, the current Socialist French president, is regularly mocked, . often by people using his nickname of ‘Flanby’, after a wobbly caramel . pudding. Earlier this month it emerged that Sarkozy views his successor as a ‘ridiculous little fat man who dyes his hair’. Barely disguised hatred between the . two politicians has been well documented, but it was the first time that . Sarkozy’s bitter language was reported in public, by l’Express, the . highly respected news magazine. Sarkozy, . 58, was roundly beaten by the portly Socialist, who is also 58, in last . year’s presidential election – and both men are seen as comic figures. Flanby: Current French president Francois . Hollande, whose figure earned him a nickname inspired by a  wobbly caramel dessert. He is even less popular than Mr Sarkozy, . who has called him a 'ridiculous little fat man' When Sarkozy was head of state, his third wife Carla Bruni put him on a fitness programme aimed at making him leaner, fitter and younger looking. Before that the diminutive Sarkozy - nicknamed 'Bling-Bling' because of his love of tacky status symbols - was himself mocked for being a chubby little man. He continued to wear platform heels, and to surround himself with smaller men in an attempt to look taller, but lost a great deal of weight through constant work-outs and giving up chocolate. Hollande, in contrast, has failed to lose the tubby image and shake off the Flanby nick-name. Opinion polls routinely reveal that Hollande is the most unpopular president in the history of the Fifth Republic, with Sarkozy a close second.","European Court of Human Rights ruled France violated a protester's right to free speech when he was prosecuted for calling Nicolas Sarkozy a 'jerk'

Warwickshire lovers, with an average score of 2.3 out of ten, were voted the least satisfactory. Women from across . the nation were also asked which men were most considerate of a woman's sexual needs. From this, it appears Warwickshire locals try hard (they came second for conscientiousness, with a 9.3 score), but to little effect. Devon men achieved an average top score of 9.5 for their thoughtfulness, while lazy Londoners came bottom of the list with just 3.3. Men living with their partners in Yorkshire scored the highest in satisfaction, with 9.3 out of 10 . The study takes a look into the bedroom habits and . preferences of those around the UK; focusing bedroom . satisfaction amongst men and women. More than 1,000 (1,802) women currently in a . co-habiting relationship, aged 18 and over, took part.

Two brazen thieves were caught on camera lounging on a sofa while swigging stolen wine after breaking into a house in broad daylight. Craig Law, 34, and Luke Smith, 22, can be clearly seen on the footage searching the front room of the house in Dudley, Birmingham, before complaining there's nothing to steal from the property. They call the owner ‘cheap’ and whinge that they will only get ‘a tenner’ for the Freesat box. The pair were caught on police cameras . which had been set up in the property, a decoy house to catch burglars, . which is one of many houses, sheds and garages in the area being used to . ‘blitz’ crime in the West Midlands. Scroll down to watch video . Caught on camera: Luke Smith, 22, pictured left holding a stolen bottle of wine and Freesat box, and Craig Law, 34, pictured right, were both filmed breaking in to a property before complaining there wasn't much to steal . Brazen: Craig Law, 34, then decided to take a few minutes to relax on the sofa while swigging wine stolen from the kitchen - before tipping it over the floor when he realised it had been filled with water . The 34-year-old then disappears from the screen before returning with a wine bottle and plonks himself down on the sofa. The thief then opens the bottle of wine before complaining it has been filled with water and chucks it on the floor. He then tries to wipe off his fingerprints with his top. Eventually Smith, in a coat, suggests they should leave before neighbours raise the alarm. Law, 34, who lived in the same street as the targeted house, was arrested within hours of the offence on 24 June. Complaining: The pair can be heard on the video footage calling the owner of the property in Dudley, Birmingham, cheap while whinging they will only get a' tenner' for the Freesat box . In no rush: Craig Law can be seen sitting on the sofa in the property - apparently unconcerned about being caught by the owners . Smith handed himself in weeks later - bringing the Freesat box with him. Law was jailed for eight months and Smith was given a ten-week suspended sentence after both pleaded guilty to burglary last month. Sergeant Matt Morgan, from Dudley CID, said: 'The pair were completely unaware that their every move was being filmed by the cameras that were dotted around the property. 'We are using more and more of these sites to catch unsuspecting thieves - houses, sheds garages and outbuildings can be fitted with equipment which is portable and easy to install, meaning any property in a burglary hot spot area can be quickly converted to capture thieves. Ignorant bliss: The pair eventually decide its time to leave - completely unaware that everything has been caught on camera . In court: Craig Law was jailed for eight months while Luke Smith was given a 10-week suspended sentence for burglary . 'The cameras also work on infra-red meaning we can download clear images - even ones filmed at night. 'We also work with the local community to reduce the likelihood of being a victim of crime in the first place and officers continue to offer crime prevention advice and encourage people to register property through the online property recording website immobilise. 'As police officers we see the negative impact crime can have on, not only people’s property but also their sense of safety and their quality of life. That is why we will relentlessly pursue burglars and ensure they are brought before the courts.'","Craig Law, 34, and Luke Smith, 22, broke into decoy home set up by police .

London Olympics bosses received £2.8million in pay-offs despite knowing their jobs would end after the 2012 Games. All 144 people who left the Olympic Delivery Authority last year received redundancy pay as the agency was wound down. Four executives received £261,000 in exit payments after leaving within months of the closing ceremony last summer. Pay-offs: Every person who left the Olympic Delivery Authority last year received redundancy pay, despite knowing their jobs would not last beyond the 2012 Games . The pay-offs will raise questions about the use of public money because all of the recipients will have known their jobs were not going to last far beyond the London 2012 Games. The ODA insisted the payments were necessary because senior managers gave up lucrative jobs elsewhere ‘with no certainty of the project's success or getting a job after the Games’. According to the annual accounts of the ODA, a total of 144 people received redundancy pay-outs in the last year. Three people left with pay-offs worth £70,000-£80,000, two received between £50,000-£60,000 and two between £40,000 and £50,000. Almost half received between £10,000 and £20,000. Golden goodbye: Dennis Hone left as chief executive of the ODA with an £80,000 golden goodbye - and became head of the London Legacy Development Corporation . Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It beggars belief that the Olympics quango employed staff on permanent contracts . 'Taxpayers' money has been wasted on payouts that were entirely avoidable had staff contracts reflected the fact that working on the Olympics was quite obviously a temporary role. 'The utter disregard shown for value for taxpayers' money by Olympics chiefs is both shocking and worrying, especially as the government are holding up the Olympics as an example of how to manage big infrastructure projects.' Dennis Hone, the ODA chief executive, received £929,000 in pay, bonuses and pensions during just two years in the job. He left with a pension pot worth £1.9million. He was made redundant at the end of March, with a golden goodbye worth £80,000, as well as an immediate pension of £373,000. But he walked into a new job as chief executive of the London Legacy Development Corporation. According to the accounts Mr Hone was entitled to receive statutory redundancy pay and a pay-off bonus equivalent worth 60 per cent of his £233,000 salary. It was agreed he would receive a lower . ‘terminal bonus’ of 49 per cent of his salary and half of it will only . be paid once the sale is completed on the East Village, the athlete’s . village which is being turned into homes, schools and shops. The . ODA's director of transport, Hugh Sumner, also received £73,000 in exit . payments, on top of his £189,000 salary, £35,000 bonus and £23,000 . employer’s pension contribution. Simon Wright, director of venues and infrastructure, received a golden goodbye worth £72,000 when he left the ODA in November. During seven months he earned £151,000 salary, a £35,000 bonus and £18,000 towards his pension. Rebuilding: David Cameron joined London Mayor Boris Johnson last week to see construction work which is transforming the London 2012 site into the Queen Elizabeth Olympic park which will be open later this month . Anniversary: One year on from London 2012 a 30,000-strong crowd enjoyed a day in the sun at the Go Local concert at London's Olympic Park . Director . of human resources Wendy Cartwright, who earned £177,000 last year in . pay, bonuses and pension, received £36,000 in exit payment. The . ODA insisted that only Mr Hone received extra cash, with all other . staff given statutory redundancy pay, any leave they were unable to take . before their employment ended, and, where appropriate, payment in lieu . of notice. A spokesman added: ‘London 2012 was a unique and challenging project and a great British success story and we needed to recruit and pay for the best talent from the private and public sectors, requiring people in many cases to give up secure long-term jobs elsewhere, with no certainty of the project's success or getting a job after the Games. ‘We had to adopt a flexible approach to managing staff contracts to ensure that key people, especially directors, remained with the project throughout periods critical to its success, until such time as the ODA could be certain that their skills and knowledge were no longer required. Our staff delivered this huge project on time and under budget - in fact making savings of over £1 billion for the public purse. ‘Like other staff, Dennis Hone received performance-related pay, but this was far from guaranteed and was measured against tough performance criteria, evaluated personally and in relation to the organisation he successfully led in the critical 18 months up to the Games, during London 2012 and immediately after. ‘Pension payments made in relation to Dennis Hone were legal and contractual obligations under the scheme of which he was a member throughout his employment at the ODA.’","All 144 staff who left Olympic Delivery Authority received pay-offs last year .

It is the popular shooter video game that has sold hundreds of millions of copies, but Call Of Duty -  which launched back in 2003 - has only just added female characters. The latest version of the much-loved game, Call Of Duty Ghosts, will include female characters - something the creators say wasn't technically possible before. Infinity Ward, the studio who created the game, due out in November, is finally allowing players to customise the sex of their characters. Violent: The Call Of Duty video gaming series is extremely popular in the gaming world and involves a lot of shooting, killing and violence . Speaking to Kotaku.com, Ghosts executive producer Mark Rubin, said: 'We really want players to feel more connected and engaged with who they are as a player. 'We felt that that was something that casual players, who are a huge portion of our fan base, would benefit the most from. 'Our fan base is huge. We cover such a dramatic range of people who play our game that we wanted to be as inclusive as we possibly could with character customisation. And that's where the idea came from. Why wouldn't we have a female [option] then?' Other popular multi-player games similar in style to Call Of Duty, such as Halo and Gears of War, added female character options to their games many years ago. When questioned, Rubin blamed the absence of women on technological issues. The people behind the game say they've added female character options in an effort to be more inclusive . 'Our previous engine would not handle that. The way memory worked in the previous engine, it never would have been able to do that.' When Rubin says 'that' he means the engine's ability to power a multi-player map made up of characters with custom appearances, including being a female. Players will now have over 20,000 possible combinations for their characters, including heads, body types, equipment, and gender . The Twittersphere seems pleased by the news. One male user wrote: 'Call of duty have done a good thing by introducing female characters it will help against sexism loads.' A Facebook group set up by women wanting female characters included in Call Of Duty (L) seem very pleased with the news (R) Another gamer said: 'No one understand how happy it makes me Call of Duty is finally featuring female characters. Maybe they read all my complaints.' Yet another player added: 'Female characters in CALL OF DUTY. Who would've thought. It's almost like we play the game or something.' And one cheeky Twitter user wrote: 'Fact: Female characters were just revealed for Call Of Duty: Ghosts. Which means the dog was revealed before they were (don't hurt me).'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:31 EST, 27 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:19 EST, 28 July 2013 . Viral Internet memes have taken many forms over the last several years. Be it 'planking,' Tebowing' or 'owling,' the arbitrary, bizarre Internet meme is here to stay - and the latest means of entertainment for the web's geekiest contributors is about as weird as they come: 'Unicorn Army.' 'Unicorn Army' - like 'Tebowing' and 'planking' before it - doesn't require much skill. In fact, it requites no skill at all - all you need is a rubber unicorn mask, a camera and a friend willing to snap a photo of you wearing your mask in any random, public, inappropriate place. 'Unicorn Army' was started last fall by a Los Angeles-based film producer who began collecting unicorn masks and handing them out to friends for pictures. Unicorning: The latest trend in Internet geekdom . Unicorn Army: The meme was started by a Los Angeles producer who gave the masks to her friends for photos . Making of a Meme: The fad gained steam earlier this month when a porn star was kicked out of a baseball game for 'unicorning' Creator of a meme: Laura DeMerchant is responsible for the latest viral Internet meme: Unicorning . 'I put it on when a pizza delivery guy was at the door and his expression . was priceless,' Laura DeMerchant, who inadvertently started the meme's craze, told the Huffington Post. 'It's such a goofy creepy thing. Especially if you wear one to Costco to get free samples.' DeMerchant posted hundreds of photos of people posing in unicorn masks on her website, UnicornArmy.com, before the idea was picked up by the general public and the meme went viral. One of 'unicorning's' biggest fans is adult film star Andy San Dimas, who is a friend of DeMerchant's and knows first hand that 'unicorning doesn't always go according to plan. Out of date: Unicorning has replaced planking as an internet trend . The Unicorn Army strikes with the EMT . Awkward: The most successful 'unicorning' occurs at the most arbitrary locations - like the grocery store . Recruitment: All you need to join the Unicorn Army is a unicorn mask and a friend with a camera . Earlier this month, San Dimas was ejected from a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game for 'unicorning' in the stands and blocking an aisle. According to reports, she was wearing a unicorn mask and dancing in the aisle with the hopes of getting on the stadium's jumbotron. It didn't work - a security guard asked her to take her seat, but she didn't and was ultimately thrown out. San Dimas says she didn't hear the security guard ask her to take her seat. Later, a Pittsburgh police officer got in a bit of trouble after he was photographed with San Dimas wearing her unicorn mask. Acting Pittsburgh Police Chief Regina McDonald said in a statement after the incident: 'We are aware of the photos on the Internet (Facebook) and are currently investigating the incident.' Uni-trouble: A Pittsburgh police officer landed himself in hot water when he was photographed 'unicorning' with porn star Andy San Dimas . The future of memes: What's next? 'Pigging?' 'Monkeying?' 'Penguining?' Internet idiocy knows no bounds . A proud soldier in the Unicorn Army bends down for a drink - in a public fountain . The investigation is understood to be probing whether the unidentified officer's behaviour was appropriate under the circumstances. According to authorities, it remains ongoing. 'I feel stupid,' San Dimas told The Huffington Post after the incident. 'I'm embarrassed. I usually only act ridiculous when I get paid.' Embarrassed or not, San Dimas sees a future in 'unicorning.' 'I think it's the new 'planking,' she said. 'And I . think it's safer. I heard someone died while planking. Unicorning is not . as dangerous -- just to a police officer's career.'","Unicorning got its start when a Los Angeles film producer started giving her friends unicorn masks to wear in photographs .

"By . Max Cisotti . PUBLISHED: . 05:01 EST, 15 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:59 EST, 15 August 2013 . As every husband and father will confess, all men need one area at home where they can retire to escape the chaos of family life. Some blokes have a shed at the end of the garden. Others have a hobby room or a garage full of DIY power tools. But my sanctuary is somewhere rather more surprising. Indeed, you might say it's a space that no self-respecting heterosexual man should admit to occupying. For my little corner of paradise in the 15th century, four-bedroom cottage I own with my wife, Claire, and our two children, Zac, 13, and Mimi, nine, is a specially designed dressing room just off the double bedroom I share with Claire. A boy and his toys: Max Cisotti and his wife Claire surrounded by his enormous shoe collection at home in Sussex . It is here that you will find my life's passion. It's not filled with shelves of vintage vinyl records or old programmes from football matches, but racks and racks of shoes - 60 pairs in total - all carefully polished and lined up in order of season, occasion and colour. By contrast, my wife's measly collection - she owns just 15 pairs - is crammed into a small wardrobe in our bedroom to make space for mine. You see, in our marriage it is me who has a footwear fetish. And while many men may guffaw into their pints, it turns out I am far from alone. A new report claims men, not women, are giving Imelda Marcos a run for her money. Revealing statistics from market researchers, Mintel, has revealed that men in my age bracket, 35 to 44, spent £157 on shoes in the last year, against £138 for women. The difference is even greater among 16-to-24 year-olds, with younger men spending £154, 15 per cent more than females of the same age. If only my desire for shoes cost so little, then perhaps I wouldn't have to suffer the endlessly withering looks from my wife (whose own weakness, by contrast, is handbags) when I return home with yet another shoebox under my arm. Statistics from market researchers, Mintel, has revealed that men aged 35 to 44 spent £157 on shoes in the last year, against £138 for women . For despite the fact I own so many shoes that I wear a different pair every single day, I simply can't resist buying more. And it's an obsession that so far has cost me well over £10,000. Looking back, I probably inherited my love of footwear from my Italian father. He took great pride in his appearance - from the bottom up - and I remember he had an electric shoe-shiner with a spinning brush which, from the age of ten, he allowed me to use to polish his extensive collection of expensive Italian shoes. I still own and wear some of my father's shoes today. And because I look after them so well they remain, forty years on, in mint condition. But my collection doesn't stop here. I have seven pairs of trainers, including four pairs of the brand New Balance in different colours. It's what all the Hollywood A-list celebrities are wearing and I have them shipped over from the USA. Then I have winter moccasins and summer moccasins, as well as ten pairs of Tods driving shoes – made famous by Princess Diana. It's not enough for me to have just one pair of Tods in brown leather, even though they cost an eye-watering £200. If I like a shoe I will always buy it in black and brown - and sometimes then in different varieties of brown. 'I have seven pairs of trainers, including four pairs of the brand New Balance in different colours. It's what all the Hollywood A-list celebrities are wearing and I have them shipped over from the USA' Right now, I am coveting a pair of Crockett and Jones loafers in a kind of hazelnut shade, even though – shamefully – I have another pair in a not-so-far-off chocolate hue. But I don't understand it when I'm accused of being excessively metrosexual. I might have to have a pair of shoes to match whatever outfit I'm wearing, but how can men only own two or three pairs of shoes? Surely you need to wear an appropriate shoe for an appropriate occasion whether you're at work, at home, on holiday, in town or in the country. Certainly, my desire for footwear knows no bounds and has been at the root of many marital disputes. Claire would walk everywhere barefoot if she had the choice and struggles, on occasion, to understand why I must possess trainers in red, blue, grey, nutty brown and suede. Yet I know, deep down, she is secretly proud of the fact that I like to look good. It's probably my shoe habit that attracted her to me. I have two pairs of Gucci shoes – one brown suede with a silver buckle and the other black patent with a silver buckle that cost £180 each in 1997. I was wearing one of them when Claire and I first bumped into each other in a pub in London. I'd like to say our eyes met across the bar, but that wouldn't be true. She was, in fact, staring in wonder at my feet. 'Claire would walk everywhere barefoot if she had the choice and struggles, on occasion, to understand why I must possess trainers in red, blue, grey, nutty brown and suede' I always judge a man by his footwear. Cheap shoes, cheap individual. The most expensive pair of shoes I own are Crockett and Jones lace-up ankle boots which cost £475. They're same Daniel Craig wore in Skyfall. You could never accuse James Bond of scrimping on style. Richard Cope, Mintel's principle trends analyst agrees with me. He insists that men are more worried than ever about their appearance and taking more time to 'groom' and stare in the mirror. 'We're seeing men occupy previously 'feminine' space in the home - spending more time on housework and parenting - but also as consumers, embracing yoga, beauty goods, and the act of shopping itself.' Former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos famously had a collection of almost 3,000 pairs of shoes . Certainly, for me, bagging a new pair of shoes to bring home is all about the thrill of the chase. It's a bit like the early days when you're dating someone. I do all my research first, comparing prices and styles. Then I linger for a while and savour the moment. It's the feeling of wanting them on my feet more than anything else that increases my desire. And then I strike. Most women, whilst professing to be fellow shoe lovers, are clueless as to when the best time is to shop for shoes. You should never go at the end of the day because your feet will be swollen and your size will fluctuate. Ideally, you should be your shoes around lunchtime. I go when Claire is at work or otherwise occupied. Right now I'm in the early stages of a relationship with yet another pair of New Balance trainers – this time in a slightly different shade of blue. I know I have to have them. But for now, I'm enjoying the feeling of thinking about them and imagining how they're going to look when they're lined up next to the others. The only question I'm pondering over is whether to put them with my summer or winter collection. You can accuse me of being obsessive if you like. You can even question my masculinity. But there's no denying that as far as footwear goes, I'll never be caught short. What was it that Elvis Presley said in a now-famous television interview? 'I think I have something tonight that's not quite correct for evening-wear. Blue suede shoes.' That just goes to prove my point. He really should have had a pair in black leather, too.","Max Cisotti lives in Sussex with his wife Claire and their two children .

The announcement, which was signed by Chris' father Larry Martin said: 'Former Director of Troon Vineyard Chris Martin has taken an indefinite leave of absence following a complaint filed last week in U.S. District Court.' Passengers, including children, looked on in horror as the beauty salon worker allegedly grew increasingly intimate with the exposed Martin before performing oral sex on him shortly after takeoff. Court papers describe in graphic detail how they then engaged in a second sex act mid-way through the 90-minute flight and did not even reign in their passionate . exchange when confronted by airline staff. They did take a break, however, when the mid-flight drink and snack service came down the aisle, but resumed shortly after. This time it was Stroble who exposed herself as the tryst became even more heated during the incident in June. At one point, according to another passenger, Martin appeared to be 'in his own world' as passions grew. Official statement: The notice posted on Facebook to inform customers that Chris Martin was taking an indefinite leave of absence, written by his dad Larry Martin . Martin's attorney, Larry C.

'We found out that she got a place to study History at Bristol University and will be starting in September, she will be very pleased. 'At the moment she is having an operation, a skin graft, and will probably be in hospital for a couple of days feeling a bit uncomfortable. 'At the moment my wife Rochelle and I are waiting for her to come out. 'She is incredibly positive, she is very strong, but we have never had any experience of this kind of thing before and nothing can prepare you for it.'

Search warrants reveal that Jim DiMaggio had tortured and killed his two victims before he drove off with the kidnapped teen. A police report that describes the scene that firefighters found when they responded to the call about DiMaggio's cabin being burnt to ashes in Boulevard, California on August 5th. They found the bodies of Christina Anderson and her six-year-old son Ethan covered with tarp, and a crowbar lying next to Christina. What remained: Firefighters found the bodies of Christina and Ethan Anderson covered with tarp, showing that they were killed before the fire that burnt down Jim DiMaggio's Boulevard cabin (pictured) When the responders went to the garage to check for more victims, they found the Anderson's deceased dog and noted that it had blood near its head. The details surrounding the nature of the bodies are scant, but the fact that the humans were draped with tarp before the firefighters got there- and that there was blood coming from the dog's head- implies that they were all killed before the fire ravaged the home. Killer: Jim DiMaggio lured the Andersons to his home before taking off with Hannah . This comes in contrast to what Hannah Anderson told friends on social media after she was freed by FBI officials who found her with DiMaggio in Idaho. When asked about their deaths on her Ask.fm account, Hannah said taht 'he tied them up in the garage'. In another post she said DiMaggio had rigged the house with explosives that went off when they were on the road, so she was not aware that her mother and brother had been killed until she was told by an FBI agent an Idaho hospital after her rescue. After fielding hundreds of questions from both strangers and friends, Hannah shut down her Ask.fm page and has only been communicating with her newfound fans via Instagram, so there has not been a chance for her to publicly clarify what she knew, and when. As for the immediate police version of events, their conclusions are clear. In the report, they stated that 'after the double homicide, DiMaggio set the house on fire'. The police reports were filed on August 5, the day after the ordeal began, when DiMaggio was on the road with Hannah, Christina's 16-year-old daughter. Two search warrants were released on Wednesday, showing what led investigators to seek permission to go to the Anderson's home and retrieve evidence in the hopes of piecing together DiMaggio's connection to the family. Their initial point of investigation was . DiMaggio's phone records, which showed that he and Hannah Anderson had . 13 phone conversations in the days and weeks leading up to her . abduction. Victims: Hannah posted both of these photos, dedicated to her late mother and brother, after she was taken back to California. Police now say that Christina (left) and Ethan (right) were tortured and killed before the fire . Giving a smile: Hannah Anderson posted this photo of herself on Instagram on Wednesday, and in the caption she wrote that 'God give his toughest tasks to the strongest soldiers' before ending with a personalized hashtag, #hannahstrong . Reliving the past: She posted this picture of her dog who also died in the fire alongside her mother and brother, and the number of likes and comments she received shows her growing following . One search warrant details how a firefighter 'noticed a green tarp on the ground near the door with human feet sticking out of the tarp. He lifted the tarp and saw the bottom half of a human torso, legs, and feet.' 'Captain Gutgesell said that he saw the human body was face down and noticed the tarp was partially melted to the head, and what appeared to be human hair. Captain Gutgesell also saw a crow bar and what appeared to be blood on the ground next to the head. 'As ... personnel worked their way through the burnt-out structure on Ross Avenue in Boulevard, they found the burnt remains of a small child. The remains could not be identified at the scene due to their condition.' The timing is critical when looking for clues in the police reports, because the forms were filled out by police who were describing the crime scene in order to have a judge grant them search warrants so that they could collect evidence from the Anderson's home to get a clearer understanding of the relationship between the two families. The list of evidence collected at the Anderson house shows that investigators found a photo of DiMaggio in one of the Anderson bedrooms. Threats: Hannah said that her captor, James 'Uncle Jim' DiMaggio threatened her with a rifle . Uncle Jim: This family photo taken in 2011 shows how close DiMaggio (far right) was with the Andersons. Hannah is seen laying across her relatives, Ethan with his hand in the air on the floor, and Christina is the furthest left woman . When they began speaking with friends and relatives, they learned that Hannah felt that DiMaggio had a 'crush' on her, so they began pursuing that line of investigation. Once she was rescued on Saturday in Idaho after being spotted by a group of horseback riders, Hannah spoke out to friends and strangers on social media who posed questions about the ordeal. 'He . tricked us,' one post on her Ask.fm account said. She explained . that DiMaggio told the Andersons to come over and ride go carts on his . property. Once they arrived, he tied up her mother and brother and fled . by car with Hannah. 'I will never forgive myself for not trying harder to save them,' another post read. Close: DiMaggio, 40, is pictured with 16-year-old Hannah, and phone records show that they exchanged 13 phone calls prior to the abduction and house fire . One user asked why she did not try to run. 'He had a gun and threatened to kill me and anyone who tried to help,' she wrote. She described it as 'more of a family crush like he had feelings as in he wanted nothing bad to happen to me'. She didn't give any further insight . into his motivation, saying that he killed her relatives and kidnapped . her 'because he's a psycho'.","Firefighters found the burned bodies of Christina Anderson and her 6-year-old son Ethan inside Jim DiMaggio's home .

A healthier offering at major fast food chains could help end the obesity crisis in America, a top health and social expert has suggested. Author David H Freedman believes that to help the poor and obese, mainstream activists should stop slamming processed food altogether and join forces with the fast food industry to encourage healthier menu options. In an essay for The Atlantic, he says that there is 'no hard evidence' that processed food causes obesity and diabetes. A better burger: David H Freedman believes that food activists should focus on improving fast food chains' menu options rather than totally eliminating products that are processed altogether . Mr Freedman also slams the 'let them eat . kale' attitude of activists, calling the ideas the 'dubious health . fantasies of a small, elite minority.' 'What percentage of the . junk-food-eating obese do we want to predict will be ready to drop their . Big Macs, fries, and Cokes for grilled salmon on chard?' he writes. He . believes that many food activists are out of touch because - like . himself - they have little in common with the average obese American. 'That person is relatively poor, does . not read The Times or cookbook manifestos, [and] is surrounded by people . who eat junk food and are themselves obese.' 'Too bad it would largely exclude the obese masses, who would continue and die early,' he writes. These statements have sparked widespread . controversy, however, especially among activists like Berkeley professor . Michael Pollan who believe that processed foods are 'evil' and must be . eliminated in favor of seasonal, 'real' foods. Food for thought: Mr Freedman has caused controversy with his views on the fast food industry . Mr Freedman believes that, while the . media has been focused on the evils of processed foods, they have . ignored the drive by fast food chains to create healthier food options. Indeed, . Dan Coudreaut, the executive chef and director of culinary innovation . at McDonald's, says that the debate over processed food has already had . an impact on the chain's menu. 'Some . want us to have healthier food, but others want us to have minimally . processed ingredients, which can mean more fat,' he explained. The company already offers oatmeal and yogurt, and most recently rolled out the Egg White Delight McMuffin - a lower-calorie, less fatty version of the ever-popular Egg McMuffin. Many media outlets have been critical of such efforts, though, because typically, chains only trimmed 50 to 100 calories per food item. But obesity scientists confirm that the difference between losing weight and not losing weight is a few hundred calories a day. At the same time, Mr Freeman points out that that some unprocessed 'health' foods are bigger calorie bombs that their fast food counterparts, with 'obscene quantities of fat and problem carbs'. 'Per 100 calories, tofu is as fatty as many cuts of beef,' he writes. Mr Freeman found that a Whole Foods Vegan Cheesy Salad booster with spirulina, chlorella and raw sea vegetables, contains more than three times the fat content  - and four times the sodium - of the beef patty in a Big Mac. He adds that Trader Joe's 'Inner Peas', (peas that are fried in sunflower oil), have six times as much fat as protein as the fast food treat. Mr Freedman's article has sparked widespread backlash. Forbes compares him to Paula Deen and slams his 'racially and class insensitive cover story'. Salon writes that he 'gets absolutely everything wrong about processed food and Americans' health', and Mother Jones calls his framework 'too simplisitic'. Health debate: Mr Freedman claims that certain items from Whole Foods have more fat than a Big Mac . University of Illinois . professor Lisa Powell also disagrees. She believes that it is the . government's responsibility to address 'food deserts', where communities . lack access to fresh produce and must instead rely on fast food. 'If . the government came into these communities and installed Brita filters . under their sinks, they’d drink water instead of Coke,' she said. 'What percentage of the . junk-food-eating obese will be ready to drop their . Big Macs, fries, and Cokes for grilled salmon on chard?' But Kelli Drenner, an obesity researcher at Stephen F. Austin State University, agrees with Mr Freedman. She says low-income communities 'won't eat broccoli instead of french fries. 'You try to make even a small change to school lunches, and parents and kids revolt,' she points out. Ironically, fast food companies often keep healthy changes under the radar. 'People expect something to taste worse if they believe it’s healthy,'  says Charles Spence, an Oxford University neuroscientist who specializes in how the brain perceives food. 'And that expectation affects how it tastes to them, so it actually does taste worse.'","Author David H Freedman believes that the typical food activist is out of touch with the average obese American .

"By . James Rush . PUBLISHED: . 12:15 EST, 15 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:18 EST, 15 August 2013 . Burial site: An estimated 6,000 bodies were 'jammed in' to shallow graves under the stone flooring of Bath Abbey (pictured) which is now beginning to collapse because the bones are rotting . An ancient city centre church is on the verge of collapse after the bones of 6,000 bodies buried underneath it have rotted away and left holes. For more than 300 years thousands of people have been buried just below the stone flooring of Bath Abbey in Somerset. It is estimated that up to 6,000 bodies have been 'jammed in' to shallow graves under the church's grave ledger stones. Now as the floor of the 500-year-old building begins to lift and collapse, the abbey has discovered 'huge great voids everywhere' beneath its flooring. 'It's where previous burials and graves have settled down and left voids,' said Charles Curnook, from the abbey. 'We were quite surprised the floor hadn't collapsed already on us.' Bath Abbey, which dates back to 1499, sits on the remains of a massive Norman cathedral. Three different churches have occupied the site and since the early 1500s, thousands of people have been buried under the building. 'There were burials here all the way through to about 1840,' said Mr Curnook. 'But at that point the place was full and they opened the Victorian cemetery at Ralph Allen Drive and stopped burying people here. 'I've had lots of estimates of how many bodies are buried here, but somewhere between 4,000 and 6,000, but they just jammed them in and jammed them in - it would have been very unpleasant to put it mildly.' But it was not until trial digs at the beginning of 2011 and 2012 that the effect the bodies were having on the long-term stability of the building was discovered. 'We were looking for the foundation walls of the Norman cathedral on which we could lay a new floor,' said Mr Curnook. 'But we didn't find any - what we found instead were huge great voids underground in every place. 'And when we went in underneath one of the medieval pillars there was fresh air underneath it, at which point we stopped work.' The honeycomb of huge voids, created by burials shifting and decaying, was a problem the Victorians had also discovered more than 100 years earlier. Project: Work is now underway to move every bit of furniture in the abbey along with its huge grave ledger stones in an effort to stabilise the ground underneath . But under Sir George Gilbert Scott, who from 1864 to 1874 completely transformed the inside of the abbey, it was a problem that had been tackled in the 'most shocking' way, according to Mr Curnook. 'They basically churned up the graves that were there and broke them up to try and consolidate the floor,' he said. 'They were very much more robust than we are - the burials had not been in the ground for more than 30 or 40 years.' 'When we went in underneath one of the medieval pillars there was fresh air underneath it, at which point we stopped work' -  Charles Curnook . Now a century and a half later the abbey is again lifting every bit of furniture in the place as well as its huge grave ledger stones in an effort to stabilise the ground underneath. And, as part of its ambitious £18m Footprint project, it is also planning to install new under-floor heating which taps into the city's hot springs. With the 'weak concrete slab' laid by the Victorians removed, contractors are now clearing wheel barrow loads of earth ready to 'drill down' to the fairly stable Norman cathedral floor on the hunt for more voids. 'We're going through the earth where there are burials but we're not going anywhere near any intact burials but obviously we are finding human remains,' said Mr Curnook. 'And wherever there are voids found we'll be pouring grouting into them to fill the floor up to stabilise it. 'We'll then bring the same earth back in again and any human remains we've found we'll carefully reinter those bones and say a prayer over them.' So far more than 10 cardboard boxes of human remains have been carefully put to one side, ready to be returned along with bits of coffin handles, inscribed plaques and lead coffin lining. Kim Watkins, the archaeological consultant on the project, said it was only disturbed graves that they were uncovering, with mainly adult bones dating from the early 1800s.","Thousands of people were buried under the stone flooring at Bath Abbey .

An author and science journalist has described how the human race now has the technology and know-how to survive the kind of mass extinction that wiped out 95 per cent of the dinosaurs 250 million years ago. Analee Newitz claims in her new book, Scatter, Adapt, and Remember: How Humans Will Survive a Mass Extinction, that we are now capable of spotting if a deadly asteroid is heading towards Earth, for example, and have the technology needed to survive in space if need be. She adds that her theory was inspired by the Lystrosaurus - a pig-lizard dinosaur that survived the Great Dying by hiding in underground burrows and later adapted to the new environments it found itself in. An author and science journalist has described how the human race now has the technology to ensure our survival for the next million years. She claims we will be thriving on a futuristic version of our planet, similar to the one depicted in this artist's impression, or be living in space . Lystrosaurus, which is Latin for shovel lizard lived around 250 million years ago in what is now Antarctica, India, and South Africa. Up to six species are thought to still exist . Lystrosaurus was the most common dinosaur of the Early Triassic period. It was previously thought it had . features which  enabled it to adapt better than other animals at the time to survive the the mass extinction, called the Great Dying, which was caused by a drop in oxygen levels. More recent theories claim it was able to survive by hiding in underground burrows. Lystrosaurus was a heavily built plant eater roughly the size of a pig. The forelimbs were even more robust than the hindlimbs, and the animal is thought to have been a powerful digger that would have helped it create these burrows. Newitz's book also discounts the theories that we would choose to upload our brains to computers and survive in a virtual world. Speaking to Yahoo News, Newitz said: 'I was learning about the survivors of the Great Dying. It was the worst mass extinction in Earth's history, caused by disastrous climate changes in the wake of a super volcano. 'And yet a humble little creature called Lystrosaurus managed to survive this horrific period. Pretty much every other animal on land went extinct. 'I figured that if this little pig-lizard could do it, so could we.' She continues that the human race has a history of being able to survive environmental changes are we have proved how good we are at adapting to change. According to Newitz, this has been helped by technological developments: 'If an asteroid were headed for Earth right now, we'd almost certainly see it coming several years out. 'We have space-based telescopes that are monitoring over 90 per cent of the nearby rocks that could hit us, and astronomers are constantly looking for more. 'All it would take are a few space probes of the kind we already have to go out into space, meet one of those asteroids, and just push it out of an intercept course with Earth. Journalist Analee Newitz believes we now have the know-how to prevent the kind of mass extinction that wiped out 95 per cent of the dinosaurs. Her theory was inspired by the Lystrosaurus, pictured, which managed to endure the Great Dying by hiding underground and adapting to the new climate . This artist's impression shows an asteroid striking Earth. Newitz believes we now have the technology to predict and prevent such an event from happening . 'We also have the technology to build carbon-neutral cities and even carbon-neutral factories. 'It was surprising to me to realise how much of our planet's future really is in the hands of humanity. 'We don't need to wait for a miracle, or for a new scientific discovery. We just need to implement the knowledge and tools we already have. We can do it!' Newitz is a strong advocate for exploring more of space and potentially setting up colonies on other planets using 'space elevators' to reach new planets. This is becoming closer to reality through projects such as the Sabre rocket engine which was recently funded by the UK Government. This engine can travel up to five times the speed of sound and could quickly and cheaply transport people into space in the near future. In her book, Newitz uses this theory to discount those made by futurists such as Google's Ray Kurzweil. This artist's impression shows a Sabre rocket engine fitted to the Skylon spaceplane. Newitz claims developments in space technology, such as this, could help the human race set up colonies on other planets . In her book, Analee Newitz believes the human race will survive by more actively exploring space . Kurzweil believes that in just over 30 years, humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity. The director of engineering at Google also claims that the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100. Newitz responded to this by telling Yahoo News:'The most implausible ideas I encountered [while writing the book] were all about what humans would do in the long term instead of going into outer space. 'Humanity has a long history of exploring, starting a million years ago when our ancestors first left Africa. 'We are a species of tool-makers and explorers, and we're damn good at it. So I find it extremely unlikely that we would give up on exploring space. 'I think it's even more unlikely that we would choose to upload our brains to computers and live in virtual worlds instead of what we know as the physical world. 'I'm sure some people will do that, maybe temporarily while traveling through space, but just staying here on Earth when there are so many other awesome places to go? I found myself unable to accept it.' When questioned about whether humans deserve to survive, Newitz said: 'Whether or not we deserve to persist isn't really relevant to whether we will do it. 'We have all the traits of a survival species, just like Lystrosaurus. Humans are life forms, and life forms always fight to survive, no matter what. It's in our most fundamental, biological natures. 'So we'd better accept that, and work on making the future as comfortable as possible. 'As human animals, we have evolved the ability to plan a better future for ourselves. We can even stop a mass extinction. We don't have to be angels to preserve our ecosystems. We just have to be practical, and not waste our time wondering whether we are good enough to deserve it.' Ray Kurzweil, pictured, said that 'frail, biological parts' of human bodies will be replaced with 'non-biological' parts in the future.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 06:00 EST, 15 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:15 EST, 15 August 2013 . The huntsmen look on as a baying pack on hounds rip a fox to shreds. And then the horn is sounded: the fox is dead. This harrowing video has been released after four members of the Middleton Hunt, based in North Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to hunting with hounds. Scroll down for video... Banned: This is the moment a pack of hounds attacked and killed a fox - footage of the banned hunt was used in evidence against four men who pleaded guilty to hunting a mammal with dogs . The men were fined between £85 and £200 each, but despite being caught, investigators doubt their case will have any impact on their future behaviour. Paul Tillsley, head of investigations at the League Against Cruel Sports, and one of the team that filmed the incident, said: 'While we are pleased with this result, and the admission of guilt from the hunt staff concerned, we doubt it will change their behaviour going forward, or that the hunt themselves will admit illegal hunting and change their ways.' The grisly video shows the terrified fox taking refuge under bales of hay for 25 minutes before hunt staff use terriers, sticks and hounds to force it into the open where the pack of dogs bring it down and tear it apart. Hiding: The huntsmen initially sent terriers to flush out the fox who had been hiding from the pack of dogs in a pile of hay bales . Killed: The hunt master, right, blew his horn to announce the kill and congratulated the hounds . A triumphant huntsman then sounds his hunting horn - the traditional call for a kill when hunting was legal. He then picks up the fox carcass and holds it over the hounds so that they can better attack and 'rag' it. The shocking clip, filmed at Full Sutton, near York, last December, was handed over to police. Huntsman Tim Holt, of Leavening, North Yorkshire, whipper-in Shaun Marles, of Titley, Hertfordshire, terrierman Lee Martin, of Birdsall, North Yorkshire, and amateur terrierman Brian Cuthbertson of Norton, North Yorkshire, all pleaded guilty to hunting a wild mammal with a dog, at York Magistrates Court. Holt was fined £200, Marles was fined £100 and Martin was fined £100. All three had to pay a £20 surcharge and £85 in costs. Cuthbertson was granted a conditional discharge for 12 months and ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge and £85 costs. Encouraging: He then picks up the carcass of the fox by the tail and allows the hounds to tug at it or 'rag' it . After the kill, the 'terrierman' picked up the carcass and took it away with the terrier continuing to bite at it . After the case, Mr Tillsley said: 'We know that many hunts are regularly out there breaking the law, and that's precisely why we have a team of professional Investigators in the field - to capture illegal activity and work with the relevant authorities to bring about prosecutions. 'This case is one of several from our work during the last hunting season (2012/13), but a new season is just beginning. We can only hope that successful cases like this will make hunts think twice about continuing to blatantly flout the law, and start adapting their practices to hunt false trails, leaving animals well alone. 'This was the will of the British public when the Hunting Act 2004 was passed, but sadly it didn't save this fox. The successful outcome of this case today is a clear example of how the Hunting Act 2004 can, and does, work when enforced.' The hunt retreats taking the evidence of the mauled fox away with them . Tim Bonnar, director of campaigns for the Countryside Alliance, said: 'The Middleton Hunt has accepted that the fox should have been shot in accordance with the exemption rather than killed by hounds. 'Whilst the Hunting Act remains a ridiculous and illogical law, pleading guilty to minimise the time and money wasted on this case, was the sensible thing to do.' The Hunting Act 2004 bans the hunting of wild mammals, notably foxes, deer and hares, with dogs in England and Wales. In addition, a person commits an offence if he knowingly permits land which belongs to him to be entered or used in the course of hunting wild mammals. A person also commits an offence if he knowingly permits a dog which belongs to him to be used for hunting. Anyone found guilty under the Hunting Act is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale. The pursuit of foxes with hounds was banned in Scotland two years in the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002. However, hunting foxes with hounds remains legal in Northern Ireland.","Tim Holt, .

A nine-month ordeal ended for Steven Iliffe, 54, and son Daniel, 26, yesterday when a judge threw out the case against them. They had begged police to go on a roof to arrest career criminal Petre Ilie. Appeal: Steven, 54 and Daniel Iliffe, 26 begged police to arrest Petre Ilie when he was caught burgling their scrap yard in Hinckley . But officers were barred by their superiors, via their radio, due to health and safety rules. Eventually, the father and son, both former soldiers, went on the roof themselves to tackle the armed man. They were stunned when the police later arrested them on suspicion of attempted murder – and later charged them with the lesser offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Yesterday, the pair said they were considering legal action against Leicestershire Police. Mr Iliffe senior said he had suffered a heart attack in a cell triggered by the stress of his arrest at their scrap metal business in Hinckley, Leicestershire, last December. He added: ‘We had suffered a string of burglaries and went up onto that roof only because the police had refused to do so.’ The men were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after tackling the man, hitting him once on the chest and hand in an attempt to restrain him . He said he grabbed Ilie by the shoulder . and ‘walloped’ him once to the chest to restrain him, while his son . admitted striking the intruder on the hand with a wooden roof baton to . try to dislodge an eight-inch metal roof bolt from his grasp. Stephen and Daniel Iliffe's case was thrown out of court. Police were not allowed to intervene in the burglary because of health and safety rules . Mr Iliffe junior is said to have struck the suspect again before the pair managed to drag him off the roof and down a ladder to police. But a PC waiting on the ground claimed to have seen them carry out a ferocious assault. Leicester Crown Court was told yesterday that Ilie, 39, already had ‘a number of convictions for burglary, failing to surrender and breaching court orders’ in the UK under the name Christopher Tudor. In 2010 he was deported but sneaked back into the UK. He was then arrested again alongside the Iliffes. Father-of-four Ilie admitted burglary with intent to steal and the attempted burglary of a nearby business earlier that night. He was sentenced to 26 weeks in jail and deported for a second time on his release in March this year. The Iliffes’ trial had been for the judge to consider a defence application to throw the case out as an ‘abuse of the court process’. The application hinged on a  decision by the UK Border Agency to refuse permission for Ilie to be returned to the UK to give evidence because he was a ‘flight risk’ – having been deported twice – and might disappear in the UK. The Iliffes claimed they could not have a fair trial if Ilie could not be cross-examined. The judge agreed and granted the application.","Stephen Iliffe, 54 and his son Daniel, 26 had begged police to make the arrest .

Although there is a slim chance of the disease returning, patients who have survived for more than a decade are considered effectively cured. More than 96 per cent of testicular cancer sufferers are beating the disease . The charity claims the result is down to its success in developing the chemotherapy drug cisplatin. The treatment, at the centre of which is an atom of the element platinum, is hailed as a ‘shining example’ of achievement through research. Cancer Research chief executive Dr Harpal Kumar said the word cure is now ‘almost a reality’ for some types of cancer. ‘But it’s important we recognise the four per cent who aren’t surviving the disease, as well as the fact that we still need treatments to be kinder to patients in the future,’ he added. ‘It’s only by doing more research that we can bring forward the day when we are able to beat all types  of cancer.’ Testicular cancer strikes about 2,300 men in the UK every year. Unlike many other forms of the disease, it tends to occur at a relatively young age and is now the most common cancer in men aged 15 to 49.

The fanatic’s wife and five children last night boarded a plane to Jordan to join Qatada, who is awaiting trial on a string of terrorist charges. The flight was funded by the Government but it means the UK is finally rid of a family which has cost the country at least £500,000 in benefits since first arriving in the early 1990s.

British soldier from World War I infantry supply unit in winter snow, his socks keeping him warm . The common phrase 'pull your socks up' could mean nothing to future generations as knee-high socks fall out of favour with British blokes. Flashing one's hairy ankle was once seen as a terrible fashion faux pas for men -  thus longer socks were an absolute necessity. But demand for the woollen, knee-high stockings - which saved our soldiers from foot rot during World War One - has slumped. Now you can't get away from naked 'mankles' on display, as modern men plump for ankle socks, ultra-short sport socks - or no socks at all. Debenhams spokesman Ed Watson: 'Knee-length socks once conquered an empire, but now they seem to be fading into history.' Officers had socks made of a softer, finer weave, while lower ranks had to make do with coarser material. Thousands of British women knitted long socks to send to the troops during both World Wars and, so important were they, that the Imperial War Museum celebrated the tradition with a collection of knee-high socks worn by British military personnel over the decades. The socks didn't just make an appearance when it was cold, soldiers also wore them in hot countries, like India. They trickled into lives of British . civilians, with many gentlemen wearing them together with calf garters to prevent them . from slipping down the leg. Employees at the General Electric Company knit socks and scarves for WWI soldiers in 1918 . Since then, though, their popularity has been in freefall. Modern, lightweight shoes makes . wearing thick woollen socks impractical and uncomfortable. Watson . believes it is the end of an era. He added: 'While there are still some men who refuse to part with tradition, knee-high socks are now worn primarily by school children and Swiss yodelling champions. 'It's a shame because these socks served the country well. 'Now it seems that we have become a nation in danger of losing its sole.' British soldiers lead away German soldiers, who crashed their plane in 1940 - they would all have worn long socks . British soldiers - who would have worn long woolly socks even in hot countries - guard the financial section of Bombay, India, following an outbreak of looting in 1947 .

An investigation into the fur trade has a staggering statistic: 69 per cent of designers used fur in their autumn/winter collections.

It’s officially festival season – I had some serious Glasto envy earlier this year and have made a vow to register for tickets for next year. I did manage to catch some of the coverage on TV though, and as well as watching all the awesome bands I loved looking at all the crazy outfits and make-up worn by festival goers. Festivals are a time when you can really go crazy with your make-up. Glitter, UV paint, crazy colours in your hair – anything goes! This week Binky Felstead uses glitter, UV paint and neon colours to create the perfect festival look . This week, I’ve enlisted the help of top make-up artist Daniel Sandler. Daniel’s taken inspiration from make-up seen on Pixie Lott and Vanessa Hudgens to create my floral festival-themed face. This happy-go-lucky hippy style look will take you from day to night whether you’ll be rocking out at Reading or raving it up in Creamfields. How To Create A Floral Festival Makeup Look . Step 2 – Powder in PlaceTo set my base, Daniel rubbed his Invisible Veil Powder into his hands and applied it to my face with his fingers. This powder gives a real airbrushed, flawless finish to the face without looking or feeling caked on, and sets make-up perfectly so you don’t have to worry about it sweating off in the heat. For the Earth Mother style floral face pattern, Daniel grabbed his Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliner in Green Velvet and began drawing a floral stem design to the side of one of my eyes . Step 3 – Shimmering ShadowNext, Daniel moved onto defining my eyes, using the Clarins Eye Quartet Mineral Palettes in Rosewood and Violet. He applied some of the pearly pink shade from the Rosewood palette all over my lids to give them a subtle iridescent glow, followed by the lilac colour from the Violet palette just below the outer corners of my eyes. This created a pretty, shimmering effect – we didn’t want anything too heavy. Finally, he dabbed some of the bright white shade from the Violet palette to the inner corners of my eyes to make them pop, as well as stroking some under the eyebrow to highlight the brow bone.Step 4 – Funky FlowersNow for the fun part! For the Earth Mother style floral face pattern, Daniel grabbed his Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliner in Green Velvet and began drawing a floral stem design to the side of one of my eyes. He then dabbed a small brush into a melted down version of his Luxury Matte Lipstick in Gigi and used this to draw on some flower petals. For the centres of the flowers, he used the shimmering golden shade from his Eyeshadow Quad in Beyond Sunset. You don’t have to be too neat when painting on a design like this – just be spontaneous and let your creativity flow! Festivals are all about having fun and you can get away with much more daring looks than you can on a day-to-day basis, so feel free to go as crazy as you like with colours and patterns. Daniel's taken inspiration from make-up seen on Pixie Lott and Vanessa Hudgens to create my floral festival-themed face . Step 5 – Crazy EyelashesThese gorgeous Paperself False Eyelashes are ideal for a festival when you’re entitled to go a little mad with your look, and their intricate floral design perfectly complements the flower pattern Daniel drew onto my face earlier. He snipped a portion off the false lashes and ran eyelash glue along their edge. He then waited until the glue was tacky before carefully applying them across my upper lash line. Applying false eyelashes can be a bit tricky, so practise in your room at home before doing it in your tent! Garnier Miracle Skin Perfector Daily All In One BB Cream . Rimmel Stay Matte Powder . 17 Eye Shadow Trios in Purple Heart and Metallic Toffee . Rimmel Soft Khol Kajal Eye Pencil in Jungle Green . Maybelline Color Sensational Vivids Lipsticks in Fuscia Flash and Electric Orange . Step 6 – Two-Tone LipFor a vibrant night-time look, Daniel created this amazing two-tone lip. He patted his Luxury Matte Lipstick in the bright fuschia shade Gigi onto my upper lip with his fingers, then did the same on my lower lip using the same lipstick in blood-orange shade Marilyn. I then gently pressed my lips together to slightly blend the colours for a smudged effect.Festivals can get very messy as I’m sure you all know, so I recommend taking some Handy Hygienic Wipes from Halo with you to freshen up as you go along. Their Eye Make-Up Remover Wipes work a treat for removing all the crazy make-up from your face when the party’s over, and they also offer Moist Toilet Tissue wipes – the ultimate festival essential!

David Beckham may be able to carry off the tightest of briefs, but it appears the women of Britain don't want their partners to follow his sartorial example. A new survey shows that a whopping 89 per cent of women favour pants with a bit more coverage, with only 11 per cent preferring their men in Beckham-style 'budgie-smugglers'. Sadly, not all men look like David Beckham when wearing tiny briefs . Eighty-nine per cent of women preferred the boxers modelled by Dan Osborne from TOWIE (right) to briefs like those on model David Sanz (left) Model David Sanz and TOWIE cast-member Dan Osborne showcased the different styles at a photoshoot for Clothes Show TV. David stepped up to sport the briefs, while Dan represented ‘Team Boxers’. The pair tried on three styles each from well-known High Street and designer names, including M&S, Calvin Klein, David Beckham for H&M, and the Clothes Show Live’s very own Henry Holland. Women around the country were then asked to vote for their favourite look on Facebook, Twitter and the Clothes Show website, with boxers emerging as the clear winner in each of the three rounds of the competition. The pair modelled boxers and briefs in a variety of styles and brands for Clothes Show TV . And it appears the models sided with the ladies. Dan Osborne said: ‘I like boxers although they probably look better on David Beckham than on me!’ But it's not time to dig out those saggy, dad-style numbers. We're in agreement with Paddy McGuinness -  who is launching Take Me Out Live at the Clothes Show Live this December - who says: ‘ I prefer boxers but not those big baggy things, more a good pair of Calvin Klein’s.’ So there you have it: invest in a nice pair of trunks if you want to please the woman in your life. Or, if you're David Beckham, stick to the tiniest pants possible.","Eighty-nine per cent of women prefer boxers over briefs for their man .

"PUBLISHED: . 12:53 EST, 3 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:37 EST, 5 August 2013 . How about this for a tall tale? This critically endangered baby giraffe was born at Woburn Safari Park yesterday to the delight of her keepers. The female nipper was born out in the . reserve in less than two hours, with all of the herd taking a keen interest. They carefully . surrounded the new infant, not only to welcome her in to the world, but to . instinctively protect her with their formidable presence. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tall tale: This as yet unnamed Rothchild Giraffe was born in less than two hours at Woburn Safari Park . Mum's the word: The new-born was just a few hours old when these pictures were taken with proud mother Frankie keeping careful watch . While fully grown giraffes have few predators in the wild, their young are preyed upon by lions, hyenas and leopards. The calf, which was born to mother Frankie and father Casper, has not yet been named. It was Frankie's third calf, and she will spend the next 13 months weaning her. Once she has found her feet, she will have the freedom to roam a seven-acre section of the park along with the rest of the herd, which they share with Grevy's Zebra and Scimitar Horned Oryx. She will spend the rest of the warm . summer months sleeping outside, but will be spared Britain's bitter . winter months when she and the rest of the herd are brought in at night. Overseeing her young: Fully grown giraffes have . few predators in the wild, but calves can be hunted by big cats, such as . lions and leopards, as well as packs of hyenas . Although the new giraffe is only a snip at the moment, when she is fully . grown he will stand a proud 20ft tall (6m) and will live to about 20 . years old. Woburn spokeswoman Dawn Jones said: 'She was born naturally yesterday at 2.40pm in the paddock. Everyone here is delighted. 'She's already 6ft tall. She was born to parents Casper and Frankie. Endangered: The birth of the Rothschild Giraffe is great news for the subspecies as there are just 600 left in the wild . 'We won't give her a name until after . about a week, but it will begin with an ""n"" - every year we name our . new-born animals with a new letter and this year it's ""n"". 'It's the second birth we've had this year and the herd is now up to 14 with the latest addition. 'At the moment she's just sheltering, . nosing around in the grass and getting used to her new surroundings. She's feeding on milk from her mother.' The birth is the latest success story the Bedfordshire wildlife park has enjoyed in breeding this endangered subspecies of Rothschild Giraffe . There are believed to be just 600 left in the wild and the park is playing a key role in safeguarding their future. The species used to be abundant in East Africa, but their numbers have dwindled to just 13 herds across Uganda and Kenya. They are now extinct in Sudan. A combination of habitat loss and poaching has led to their demise. Now a protected species, they used to be hunted for their tails. They typically favour open grassland, . scrub and woodlands. Their long necks allow them to feed on leaves from . taller trees such as acacia and wild apricots. They also eat shoots, . fruit and other vegetation. According to website Rothschild's . Giraffe Project, the subspecies was first named by Lord Walter . Rothschild, a zoologist and member of the famous banking family . following an expedition to East Africa in the early 1900s. The Rothschild Giraffe is sometimes also known as the Baringo giraffe or the Ugandan giraffe and is easily distinguished from other giraffe subspecies by its unique appearance. They are lighter in colour, their patches are less jagged and they have no markings . below the knees as if they are wearing cream socks, making them easy to . recognise.","Home-grown success in battle to protect an endangered species of giraffe .

"By . Daniel Miller . PUBLISHED: . 05:18 EST, 7 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:01 EST, 7 February 2013 . A south African man has become the first person in the world to be convicted of killing a great white shark after he hooked one while fishing from the shore. Leon Bekker, of George, Western Cape, . pleaded guilty to contravention of the Marine Living Resources Act which . includes attempting to kill, disturb or be in possession of a white . shark without a permit. Bekker pointed out that he had no . idea at first that he'd hooked a great white shark but he pleaded guilty so . as not to waste the court's time. Catch: Fisherman Leon Bekker poses with the great white shark he caught off the South African coast . But in a landmark decision Mossel Bay Magistrate's Court handed him a fine of R120,000 (£8,550)  or a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for five years. The unprecedented case is the only great white shark conviction in a South African court to date - the first country to impose legislation in protecting great white sharks. Great white sharks have been protected . in South African waters since 1991 and no person is permitted to catch . them, or even to attempt to catch them. Penalty: In a landmark ruling, Bekker was fined £8,500 under the Marine Living Resources Act . But for years anglers who landed the sharks were able to successfully argue that they had not been targeting great whites. Environmentalists believe the ruling . sets a new precedent in that anyone using heavy-duty fishing tackle in . an area where white sharks are known to inhabit is effectively . breaking the law. Shark scientist Ryan Johnson, who appeared as an expert witness in the case, welcomed the verdict. He told the Cape Times: 'A lot of law . enforcement officers were reluctant to prosecute because they knew it . was difficult to prove the anglers had targeted white sharks. 'This prosecutor analysed the law and . said as anglers fishing with heavy equipment in an area known for white . sharks, they would have a reasonable expectation of catching great . white sharks, and so just by fishing with that equipment in that area . they are in effect breaking the law.' Photographs of Bekker giving a . thumbs-up sign after hauling the shark onto the rocks, sparked an angry . outcry after they were published in the paper two years ago. However photographs of anglers posing with dead great whites are not uncommon and there is an on-going illegal trade in great white shark body parts such as jaws, which fetch a very high price. Department of Agriculture, Forestry . and Fisheries spokesman Lionel Adendorf said: 'This is the first great . white shark case and conviction in any South African court. We are . certain that the sentence will serve as a deterrent.' Bekker pleaded guilty saying he did not want to waste the court's time but pointed out he had no idea he'd hooked a great white shark at the time . Although great white sharks have been protected in South Africa since 1991, there is evidence to suggest that they continue to be targeted by recreational fisherman as a trophy species . The World Wildlife Fund welcomed the . ruling. Spokesman Dr Eleanor Yeld Hutchings said: 'This is the first . legal case, and conviction, around the catching of a white shark in . South Africa. 'For . authorities to take such clear action is an excellent indication of . their commitment to upholding protected species status.' The not inconsiderable sentencing of Leon Bekker will hopefully be a deterrent to these practices in South Africa. As far as I am aware, this is also a world first in terms of prosecution for harming a white shark.' The great white was caught on the shore near the city of Geroge on South Africa's Cape . Anger: Photographs of Bekker hauling the shark onto the rocks, sparked an outcry in South Africa after they were published two years ago . No person is allowed to trade in, or have possession of any parts of a white shark, even their teeth, without a permit. In Australia, while Great White . Sharks are also protected species in Australian waters, legislators have . recently approved a plan to kill sharks that venture too close to . people in the water. There . were five fatal shark attacks in Western Australia in the past year, . with many residents calling for a more aggressive shark management . plan. South Africa sees it's fair share of great white attacks. one particular hotspot is Capetown's Fish Hoek beach which has seen three attacks in the last eight years. Hot spot: Capetown's Fish Hoek beach has seen three attacks in the last eight years . In September last year, British tourist Michael Cohen was attacked with a . shark biting off his right leg above the knee and part of his left leg. That followed two fatal attacks including that of Zimbabwean tourist Lloyd Skinner who was pulled undewater and dragged out to sea in 2010. Only his diving goggles were found. And in November 2004, a 77-year-old Tyna Webb, was attacked and killed by a shark while doing the backstroke. City officials are now considering installing a 355-metre long net across a stretch of  the beach to create a safe swimming area.","Leon Bekker was fishing from the shore using heavy duty tackle .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Ap Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:01 EST, 14 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:17 EST, 14 August 2013 . Anthony Weiner took a hands on approach at Tuesday's heated New York City mayoral debate and detailed exactly how he'll help get a grip on the city's issues, both big and small. Weiner used his opening remarks in the televised debate to again apologize for the sexting scandal that knocked him from his perch atop the Democratic pecking order in the New York City race. ‘I have made mistakes,’ he said, often adding hand gestures for emphasis. ‘They have embarrassed myself and hurt my family.’ Suggestive? New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner participates in the first primary debate for New York City mayor in Tuesday . Squinting: Weiner shows just how closely he consider the city's big, and small, issues . Pointing the finger: The shamed former congressman proved repeatedly during the debate Tuesday that he's a big fan of little hand gestures . But Weiner's contrite stance ended soon thereafter, as he turned combative while trading barbs with his rivals, including the race's new front-runner, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio; the party's 2009 nominee, ex-comptroller Bill Thompson; and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn. The night's most searing exchange came when Weiner criticized Quinn's assistance in overturning city term limits in 2009 to give independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg another four years in office. ‘I apologized for my personal behavior,’ Weiner said. ‘The speaker refuses to apologize for overturning the will of the people.’ Quinn, who frequently allies herself with Bloomberg, did what she rarely does on the campaign trail and explicitly brought up Weiner's admission that he traded illicit online messages with women even after he resigned from Congress in 2011 for similar behavior. Lively: Weiner, here with Democratic foe Bill Thompson, repeatedly pointed, gestured, and gesticulated throughout Tuesday's debate . Clean hands? Weiner may be in fourth place among his opponents, but he (and his hand gestures) was the biggest focus of Tuesday's deebate . Open armed: Weiner gestures between City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Bill Thomspon . ‘No New Yorker should be lectured by Anthony Weiner,’ she said. ‘Neither me nor anybody else on this stage ... needs to be lectured by Anthony Weiner about what we need to apologize for.’ Weiner, who's married, remained a lightning rod throughout the hour-long debate. De Blasio, who moved to first in a poll released hours before the debate, called for Weiner to drop out of the race. Thompson chided Weiner for not challenging Bloomberg in 2009. And Quinn mocked his congressional record. Throughout Tuesday's debate, Weiner was the target of attacks from opponent Christine Quinn . Winning handily? Bill de Blasio, at far right, is now the race's front runner. With him are opponents John Liu, Bill Thompson, Anthony Weiner, and Christine Quinn . The combative exchanges typified the hostile atmosphere on stage among the five candidates, who also included Comptroller John Liu, as the race to replace Bloomberg entered its final, frantic weeks. If no candidate reaches 40 percent of the vote in the primary, the top two advance to a run-off three weeks later. De Blasio tops the field at 30 percent, followed by Quinn at 24, Thompson at 22, Weiner at 10 and Liu at 6. With a crowded field making a run-off seemingly inevitable, the candidates jockeyed to land memorable attacks during the debate, the first shown on broadcast TV. Force of habit: At Monday's BuzzFeed Brews interview, Weiner's gesticulation skills were previously on display . The August 12 BuzzFeed interview was held in New York City . Warm-up: Earlier in the day Tuesday, Weiner spoke at a forum in New York City and warmed up his pointing skills . Quinn, who has been first or second in every poll taken this year, was a frequent target. Her rivals repeatedly hit her not just on the elimination of term limits but for her hopes to retain police Commissioner Ray Kelly even after a judge this week ordered a federal monitor oversee the police department's stop-and-frisk policy. Thompson called Kelly ‘the face of an abusive policy.’ And Liu said the program, which critics believe unfairly targets blacks and Latinos, ‘was not just unconstitutional but was unconscionable.’ Tall order: Weiner continues to make his plea with New York City voters in his battle to overcome his sexting scandal and become mayor . Second chances: Weiner spoke before the debates Tuesday where he's hoping to help snag a political second act . Kelly and Bloomberg credit the policy for driving down crime. Quinn, who drew constant contrasts between her legislative records and her rivals' thin resumes, said she ‘would be lucky’ to keep Kelly as head of the New York Police Department but said she didn't agree with his steadfast defense of stop-and-frisk. De Blasio, who was an afterthought in the race for much of the summer, repeatedly grabbed the mantle of the campaign's ‘progressive choice.’ And, in one of the debate's few light moments, he revealed that he went to the same Massachusetts high school as former basketball star Patrick Ewing but ‘only one of them made the NBA.’","The latest polls put Weiner at fourth in the Democratic pecking order .

Bright red braces - the ultimate status symbol of the City’s 'greed is good' culture during the Thatcher years - have finally fallen out of fashion. The garish accessories, sported by Michael Douglas as ruthless Gordon Gekko in Wall Street, once summed up the brash 'City casino' culture. However, red braces have fallen spectacularly from grace and demand has plummeted as City wheelers and dealers seek to portray themselves as 'a safe pair of hands'. Red braces first shot to prominence in The City after deregulation and the release of the 1987 blockbuster movie Wall Street. Actor Michael Douglas is pictured here, sporting the red braces, as brash Gordon Gekko in the movie . For the first time in almost 30 years, department store Debenhams now stocks just one pair. Instead its most popular braces are now risk averse grey, traditional bank manager dark blue and sombre serious black. Debenhams spokesman Ed Watson: 'The days when Gordon Gekko was a fashion symbol in the City has come to an end. 'City workers are abandoning styles once associated with flamboyant deal making and opting instead for colours which enhance the impression of being a safe pair of hands.' Red braces first shot to prominence in the City after deregulation and the release of the blockbuster 1987 movie Wall Street. Out went bowler hats, three piece suits and roiled up umbrellas as a new breed of trader, banker and analyst swept more conservative dressers aside. Times have changed: instead of red braces, business leaders now wear 'risk averse' grey or blue ties for a more serious look (as shown by model) With fortunes being made on the back of high risk investments, red braces became a virtual uniform as highly competitive teams decided that they too could be like Gordon Gekko. Mr Watson said: 'Our sales figures show that bright red braces first went into decline in 2008 when so many banks collapsed. 'The decline became even more severe the following year as more people began to realise that this was not a temporary blip and the reasons for the crash began to emerge. 'Suddenly flamboyance and risk taking became bad words, and City workers, eager to distance themselves from that culture, switched to conservative colours instead. 'Now our two top selling braces are both traditional grey - one is a light grey with pin dots and the other dark grey with subtle diagonal stripes.' He added: 'The message they send out is clear - it is one of trust, caution, and a highly conservative approach to handling money. 'It is safe to say that neither would have featured in Gordon Gekko’s wardrobe. 'Our next most popular colour for braces is beige. We’re assuming that these are now the braces of choice when today’s bankers really want to let their hair down.'","Red braces shot to prominence after deregulation and the 1987 blockbuster movie Wall Street .

Arsenal footballer Andre Santos was banned from driving for 12 months today after admitting speeding away from chasing police at up to 140 miles per hour because he was late for training. The 29-year-old Brazilian international weaved in and out of rush-hour traffic on the A1 dual carriageway and M25 motorway in his £110,000 Maserati GranTurismo supercar on August 17 as he travelled to the club's London Colney training ground. Santos repeatedly failed to stop despite being chased 'for some considerable time' by a marked police car with sirens and blue flashing lights, magistrates were told. Andre Santos appeared at Hendon Magistrates Court today (pictured). The Brazilian defender, who plays for Arsenal, was banned for 12 months after admitting driving without due care and attention . When he was eventually arrested yards from the training ground in Hertfordshire he told officers his blaring music had prevented him spotting them. Santos, who wore a smart navy suit and dark tie, denied a charge of dangerous driving but admitted the lesser charge driving without due care and attention when he appeared at Hendon Magistrates Court today. The more serious dangerous driving charge was subsequently dropped. Magistrates banned him from the roads for 12 months and fined him £3,600 after ruling that he 'prioritised his own journey over his duty to drive in a safe manner.' Inder Gohlar, prosecuting, told the court the footballer was spotted on the A1 'accelerating hard' away from a speed camera. Speed: Santos (right) has apologised for letting himself and Arsenal down after being caught driving at speeds of up to 140mph . Police driver PC Chris Hurt put on his sirens and sped up to 120 mph to try and catch up to Santos who was travelling in the region of 140 mph. Ms Gohlar said: 'It was then he realised the driver had no intention of stopping for the officers. 'The Maserati was very rapidly pulling away from them. He (PC Hurt) took his car up to just below 120 mph and the Maserati was still pulling away from him. 'He estimated that he was doing in the region of 135 to 140 mph.' The court heard Santos pulled on to the M25 and began weaving in between lanes, causing a danger to other road users. Ms Gohlar said: 'The road was busy and other drivers were breaking sharply to avoid contact with him. 'The driver again forced his way back to the nearside lane having no regard for other road users and forced the drivers to break in order to avoid an accident. 'He then exited at a junction and in doing so the driver nearly lost control.' Star: Santos was in the thick of the action for Arsenal last night as his side thrashed Coventry City in the Capital One Cup (pictured left and right) Police officers eventually caught up with him close to Arsenal's training ground and shouted through the window for him to stop. He was arrested and taken to a police station where he told officers he had been in a rush to get to training and did not realise they were following him. In a statement, he said: 'My music was very loud and I was not paying attention. 'I very much regret driving in this way and I apologise to the police for the trouble I've caused.' The court heard Arsenal Football Club will punish the player, but he was supported in the dock by a club interpreter. A statement was read from Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger in which he described Santos as . 'Considerate': Santos's club manager Arsene Wenger spoke up for his player in a statement to the court . 'friendly, considerate and helpful,' and a player who 'contributes to the life of the club and undertakes charitable work within the community on behalf of the club.' Alexandra Ward, in miitgation, told the court Santos was 'embarrassed and ashamed' to be before the courts. Banning the father-of-one - who owns several high-powered cars plus a tiny Smart Car for shopping - Chair Golda Rosen said: 'Given your high speed and the manoevres undertaken and the extended period of this driving we must disqualify you today for a period of 12 months.' Santos, who joined the Gunners last year from Turkish side Fenerbahce, was arrested on the eve of the Premier League season as Arsenal prepared for their opening game against Sunderland at the Emirates stadium.

The 83-year-old woman is driven by a simple desire to see justice done for her son and daughter-in-law after a string of tragedies in the family. Her son and his wife were killed and their bodies burned by carjacking fugitives in 2010 on the desolate wind-swept plains of New Mexico. Vivian Haas, left, and her daughter, Linda Rook, hold a memorial pamphlet for the slain Oklahoma couple Gary and Linda Haas during an interview in Albuquerque, N.M, in 2011 . The next year, a tornado flattened Haas' neighborhood in Joplin, Missouri. Earlier this year, her granddaughter was found shot to death in her home. On Monday, the last of the three people charged with killing her son and daughter-in-law, Gary and Linda Haas of Tecumseh, Oklahoma, goes to trial. Haas will be there. She says wants him to be held accountable for forever changing her life and the lives of her family members. She wants the tragedies to end. 'We're not quitters,' she said of her family's pursuit of justice. 'We've just got to do it. This has to be taken care of. The couple, 61-year-old high school sweethearts and recent retirees from General Motors, were headed to Colorado for an annual camping trip when they decided to take a break at a rest stop near the New Mexico-Texas border in August 2010. Gary and Linda Haas (pictured) of Tecumseh, Oklahoma, were murdered while traveling through eastern New Mexico in 2010 . This photo shows a glove near what was left of the slain Oklahoma couple's burned-out travel trailer after the crime scene was cleaned up on a remote ranch near Santa Rosa, N.M in 2010 . They had traveled the same route for . the past 11 summers. This year, they were spotted by the fugitives, who . prosecutors say were eying their truck and travel trailer. At . gunpoint, prosecutors say, the couple was forced to drive west along . Interstate 40 before pulling off onto a lonely two-lane road. They were . then ordered into their trailer, and gunshots rang out. The Haases were dead, their bodies found later in the charred rubble of their trailer. Their truck, money and guns were gone, but two of their small dogs were found nearby, both sunburned and one with burns on her back and paws. Their deaths sent the family into a tailspin. What followed has been a roller coaster of emotion – and more tragedy. Vivian Haas' neighborhood was among those in the path of the tornado that devastated much of Joplin in 2011. The old-growth trees in her yard and her vehicle were long gone after the storm, but she survived. John McCluskey (left) and Tracey Province (right) escaped from a medium security prison in Arizona in 2010 and are on trial for murder . She continues to believe it was for a reason – to see the case through. Earlier . this year, Gary and Linda Haas' only daughter was found shot to death . inside her home in Oklahoma. Her husband has been charged with murder. Now without parents or grandparents, their two-year-old son is being . raised by relatives. Whether things would have turned out differently had Gary and Linda Haas been alive is almost too painful for the family to contemplate. The two were the family organizers, the glue that kept everyone together. 'Every absence is a hole,' said Linda Rook, Gary Haas' younger sister. 'Unfortunately, we've had a lot of absences in the last few years that have been due to tragedy. It's hard.' 'Just counting them up, that's a big loss,' Vivian Haas said. 'We've been through a lot.' Daniel Renwick (pictured) was the third inmate to escape in Arizona and faces murder charges . Haas and Rook have traveled thousands of miles over the last two years, braving blizzards and other inclement weather to attend numerous hearings and trials prompted by the escapes in Arizona and the killings in New Mexico. And it could take several more months to conclude what they hope is the final chapter. Attorneys in the case have warned the jury of nine women and three men that the trial could last four months. And if John McCluskey is convicted, they will then have to decide whether he should face life in prison or death. McCluskey was one of three inmates who broke out of a medium-security prison near Kingman, Arizona, with the help of Casslyn Welch, his cousin and fiancee. Welch acknowledged throwing cutting tools onto the prison grounds. McCluskey, Tracy Province and Daniel Renwick used the tools to break through a perimeter fence and flee into the desert. Welch had also supplied the men with guns and money and Renwick with a get-away vehicle. Renwick was captured a day later after a shootout in Colorado. McCluskey, Province and Welch . eventually found themselves in New Mexico. Prosecutors said that's when . the group decided to target the Haases for their truck and trailer. Province . and Welch pleaded guilty last year in connection with the slayings and . face life sentences. They're expected to testify in McCluskey's trial. McCluskey is facing 20 counts in connection with the slayings. According to the indictment, he told federal agents after his arrest that he shot Gary Haas once and Linda Haas three times. But defense attorney Gary Mitchell told a panel of prospective jurors that his client did not kill the couple nor did he intend for them to be killed. Vivian Haas doesn't believe him. 'He cannot imagine the hurt he has brought on this family,' she said of McCluskey.","Vivian Haas' son and his wife were killed and bodies burned by carjacking fugitives in 2010 in New Mexico .

A neighbor who has tried to stop the son of Boston Red Sox announcer Jerry Remy from allegedly stabbing his girlfriend to death spoke out Friday about the tragedy, expressing regret that he could not save her. Middlesex prosecutors said Benjamin Ray attempted to came to the rescue of Jennifer Martel as she was being attacked by her boyfriend of seven years, Jared Remy, at her Waltham, Massachusetts home, but his efforts were thwarted when the burly suspect slashed at him with a kitchen knife. 'I was there. I did what I could to stop it, and it wasn’t enough,' a somber Ray sporting sunglasses told reporters outside his home just steps away from the scene of the grisly murder. Rescue attempt: Neighbor Benjamin Ray talked about how he tried to pull Jared Remy off Jennifer Martel, but had to retreat when the burly boyfriend allegedly slashed at him . Ray described Martel as a 'great girl' and 'a good mom' who was 'full of life,' adding that the brutal attack in which the young woman was stabbed over and over again never should have happened, Boston.com reported. ‘It’s not an easy thing to watch,’ Ray said of the stabbing. ‘It’s not an easy thing to try to stop and not be able to.’ Although the neighbor was reluctant to further discuss on Friday the deadly confrontation - or his brief involvement in it - when interviewed by police after the murder, Ray recounted that he saw 'Remy on top of Ms Martel, slashing her,' the report stated. 'Mr Ray attempted to pull Remy off and was unable to do so. 'Remy turned and tried to stab Mr. Ray with the knife. Mr. Ray jumped back out of the way,’ investigators wrote. Jared Remy, 34, was arraigned today on murder and domestic assault charges in the gruesome slaying of his partner of seven years, Martel, which took place at their Waltham home in the presence of their four-year-old daughter just a day after the hulking former security guard was released without bail for assaulting her. Police arrived at the residence in the Windsor Village apartment complex at around 9.30pm Thursday following multiple 911 calls. They found Martel, 27, bleeding in the fenced-in patio covered in stab wounds. Hulk: Jared Remy, pictured, appears at Waltham District Court for his arraignment, Friday, August 16, 2013 . Middlesex Assistant District Attorney Lisa McGovern said Remy attacked Martel in the kitchen, in the living room and on a stairway, leaving behind a trail of blood, before pinning her to the ground of the patio where he stabbed her repeatedly. 'Great force and great effort was made by this defendant in stabbing Miss Martel over and over and over again' McGovern said, labeling the attack a 'protracted struggle.' Remy, a hulking muscle-man, was arrested at the scene after he held his hands over his head and surrendered to officers. His clothing was soaked with Martel's blood and, according to WBZ-TV, he had an engagement ring in a sunglasses case in his pocket. Just feet away lay Martel's body, shirtless and covered in blood with stab wounds to her front left shoulder area as well as wounds to her neck. A blue cloth covered her face. 'There was a substantial amount of blood on the ground surrounding the victim's head and upper torso area,' police said. 'Martel was motionless, not breathing.' Tragic: Martel, pictured, was found bleeding from multiple stab wounds on Thursday night . Horror: The stabbing took place while the couple's daughter, pictured, was home . On Wednesday, Remy, who in 2005 . admitted beating up a former girlfriend, appeared in Waltham District . Court to face allegations that he assaulted Martel in a domestic . violence incident on Tuesday night. He allegedly threw her against a mirror. He was released on personal . recognizance, and Ryan said that . the bail recommendation made by her office was based, in part, on a . conversation with Martel. 'The bail recommendation was based on a totality of circumstances,' Ryan said. She . added: 'On Wednesday, a (bail) request was made based on the . information that we had on Wednesday. Obviously and tragically, there is . different information today, Friday morning.' Martel's mother told The Boston Herald that her daughter had been 'planning her escape' when she was allegedly murdered by her long-time boyfriend. 'She said, ""I was planning my escape,""' Patty Martel, 53, said. 'This was on Wednesday. She said, ""Don’t worry, I’m planning my escape.""'

Patty Martel said her daughter had returned to her apartment yesterday to get her belongings before fleeing. 'She went back to the house to go get stuff and that's when he killed her,' she said. 'And that's why he killed her, because she called the cops on him.' At least one neighbor, Benjamin Ray, in the apartment complex rushed to Martel's aid and tried to pull Remy off her. But he was driven back when Remy waved his knife in Ray's direction, McGovern said. 'It's not an easy thing to watch. It's not an easy thing to try and stop,' Ray told Boston.com. 'I did what I could to stop it. And it wasn't enough.' Witnesses told police they saw Remy 'on top of Miss Martel stabbing her repeatedly with the knife' on the patio.

Dinosaurs once crawled on all fours like human children before switching to two feet as they reached adolescence, experts have discovered. Analysis of bones 100 million years old showed baby Psittacosaurus had long arms and short legs, which were used to scuttle around shortly after hatching. The arms grew quickly between the ages of one and three, suggesting that the Psittacosaurus continued to move on all fours during their ‘toddler’ years. Dinosaurs crawled on all fours like toddlers before switching to two feet when they grew up, experts have discovered . But aged four, Psittacosaurus - known as the ‘parrot dinosaur’ - experienced a massive growth spurt in their legs, while the development of their arms slowed. This meant legs grew to twice the size of arms - causing the dinosaurs to spend their adult life on two feet. Palaeontologists from Beijing, Bristol and Bonn discovered the differences in limb growth through a combination of biomechanical analysis and bone histology. Qi Zhao, from the Institute for Vertebrate Palaeontology in Beijing, carried out the intricate study on bones of babies, juveniles and adults. Analysis of bones 100 million years old showed baby Psittacosaurus had long arms and short legs, which were used to scuttle around shortly after hatching . Dr Zhao, who conducted the research as part of his PhD thesis at the University of Bristol, said: 'Some of the bones from baby Psittacosaurus were only a few millimetres across, so I had to handle them extremely carefully to be able to make useful bone sections. 'I also had to be sure to cause as little damage to these valuable specimens as possible.'There are more than 1,000 specimens of Psittacosaurus from the Cretaceous period of China and other parts of east Asia, around 100 million years ago. A 'cold snap' that made the dinosaurs shiver 116 million years ago caused a crisis in the oceans similar to the effects of global warming. The 2.5 million-year cooling period led to the disruption of populations of small plants and animals that form the foundation of marine ecosystems. For most of the Cretaceous period, which marked the height of the dinosaurs' reign, the Earth was a 'hothouse' with temperatures around 6C higher than they are today. But scientists confirmed that right in the middle of the Cretaceous average global temperatures plunged by up to 5C. Analysis of an ocean floor sediment core taken from the north Atlantic showed how the change led to a major shift in the global carbon cycle. It coincided with the decline of some groups of marine plankton and extinctions of surface-dwelling micro-organisms. At the same time, the abundance of certain cold-water organisms increased. Dr Zhao sought special permission from the Beijing Institute to section two arm and two leg bones from 16 individual dinosaurs, aged from less than one year to 10 years old, or fully grown. He carried out intricate sectioning work in a special palaeohistology laboratory in Bonn in Germany. The one-year-olds had long arms and short legs and scuttled about on all fours soon after hatching. Bone sections showed that the arm bones grew fastest when the dinosaurs were aged between one and three. From four to six years, arm growth slowed down and the leg bones showed a massive growth spurt, meaning they ended up twice as long as the arms. Professor Xing Xu of the Beijing Institute, who supervised Dr Zhao’s thesis, said: 'This remarkable study, the first of its kind, shows how much information is locked in the bones of dinosaurs. 'We are delighted the study worked so well, and see many ways to use the new methods to understand even more about the astonishing lives of the dinosaurs.' Professor Mike Benton, of the University of Bristol, who also supervised Dr Zhao’s PhD, said: 'These kinds of studies can also throw light on the evolution of a dinosaur like Psittacosaurus. 'Having four-legged babies and juveniles suggests that at some time in their ancestry, both juveniles and adults were also four-legged, and Psittacosaurus and dinosaurs in general became secondarily bipedal.' The research is published in the journal Nature Communications.","Psittacosaurus had long arms and short legs, and scuttled around .

But one London hair salon has taken the creative approach to grooming one step further and is offering £40 dye jobs for your short and curlies along with their regular cut and blowdries. Whether you're after a pink heart-shaped patch or a pretty leopard print 'do, Bleach Salon, which has branches in Topshop's Oxford Circus flagship and in Dalston, has a dye job to suit even the quirkiest of tastes. Controversial: Gucci caused a furore when they used this photo of visible pubic topiary in a 2003 ad campaign . Fan: Florence and the Machine singer Florence Welch is a regular visitor to Bleach Salon . The looks gaining the most love at the moment are the leopard-print landing strip and a vivid neon dye job. But it seems that not everyone is impressed with the salon's new offerings, with owner Alex Brownsell admitting that pubic dye jobs provoke strong reactions among her clientele. 'It’s a bit like Marmite,' she told NY Mag. 'people seem to either love it or hate it. We put it [pubic dye jobs] on the menu for a bit of fun but it’s getting to be quite popular, especially because of the summer. 'I’ve had it done, a few of our stylists have had it done, loads of my friends have been in and had it done. 'We’ve got people coming in just for a wax that are seeing it, thinking about it, and then coming in the next time asking for it. Every one of my friends who has had it done has come in for a second go.' Unusual though a neon Brazilian might be, it's not the first time that Brownsell's creative urges have made waves. She was famously responsible for the dip-dyed 'ombre' hair trend that dominated last summer and counts Florence and the Machine's Florence Welch and singer Sky Ferreira among her clients. Brownsell was also responsible for Rihanna's controversial embrace of greying locks - and has revealed that it was discovering grey pubic hairs on her own nether regions that led to the launch of the salon's increasingly popular pubic prettying service. Customer: Alex Brownell, Bleach Salon's owner, also counts American singer Sky Ferreira among her clients . 'First you pick the shape you want —  a triangle, . strip, heart —  anything like that,' she explains of the dyeing process. 'Then Chelsea [Bleach's public hair expert] will paint the area in . the shape, you don’t actually dye all of it. 'It is then bleached, left . on for 10 to 15 minutes, then wiped off and a secondary colour is . applied. This is a stain and only takes two minutes. 'Then Chelsea takes . that off and does the waxing procedure as normal. It’s really quick. No . paper underwear, but you do have a disposable towel on top and a blanket . on your legs so you’re not just sitting there waiting.' She added: 'We’ve done multicolour, pink and blue hearts — hearts are very popular — tie-dye, and leopard print.

At about 10:05, they heard a baby crying,' Houston Fire Department spokesman Captain Ruy Lozano told ABCNews.com. They went outside and found the child in a stroller. 'They immediately grabbed the baby and took him inside out of the heat because it's very hot in Houston right now,' Lozano said. The baby was 'clean, well-fed and well-dressed' and firefighters played with him until protective services arrived. The boy was then taken to the hospital to be examined. 'He was released yesterday evening from the hospital and placed in a foster home,' Child Protective Services spokesman Estella Olguin told ABC.

Under Texas law, parents who cannot care for their child can leave the infant at a safe place such as a fire station, hospital or EMS station up to the age of 60 days, without facing questions or charges. Because this baby is older than 60 days protective services have to investigate the case and seek out relatives who might want to care for the baby. Home: The mother and her boyfriend, who claims to be the child's father, live at the above house in Houston . Protective services have taken a DNA sample from the woman and they are sure she is the child's mother. 'She showed us legal documentation -- birth certificate, medical records, Social Security -- and photographs. And she looks like him,' Olguin said. '(There are) photographs of the baby throughout the few months of his life and we really have no doubt that she is the mother.' When protective services contacted the baby's father he said he wanted to take custody of the child. A DNA sample will be taken confirm paternity and the infant will remain in foster care in the meantime. Lozano applauded the woman's actions. 'The lady still showed a lot of courage,' he said. 'I don't know what's going on in her life. Sometimes they feel so desperate they don't see any other way out. 'I'd rather have them taken to a fire station than for me to make those calls where I find a baby in a dumpster or a ditch.'","Firefighters at Fire Station 39 in Houston, Texas discovered the little boy on Monday when they returned from a call and heard crying .

"By . Anthony Bond . PUBLISHED: . 05:57 EST, 13 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:54 EST, 13 March 2013 . It was a scene straight out of The Simpsons, played out in real life. The father of  eight-year-old Theo Rowland-Fry would have been forgiven for shouting out Homer Simpson's classic catchphrase D'oh! after realising what his cheeky son had done. Theo had been regularly using the family iPad to play The Simpsons game Tapped Out and often bought the virtual doughnuts on offer to help progress through the game. Expensive: Nick and Lisa Rowland-Fry were left furious after their eight-year-old son ran up a £1,000 bill after buying virtual doughnuts on an iPad Simpsons game. Mr Rowland-Fry and son Theo are pictured . However, little did the eager youngster know that he was racking up an enormous £980 bill for his parents. Nick and Lisa Rowland-Fry, from Bristol, only realised that their son had spent the huge amount after their bank account had been completely cleared. Mr Rowland-Fry, an estate agent, said: 'It was only when my wife rang me and asked where all the money had gone that we found out what had happened. 'She got a statement and saw there were more than 100 purchases on iTunes for between £1.50 and £75, from the middle of January and the beginning of this month. 'We received no emails alerting us to what was happening.' Mr Rowland-Fry said it is too easy for children to buy additional items without being asked for any more details to confirm the purchase. Pricey: Theo Rowland-Fry decided he needed extra help to progress on his Simpsons iPad game Tapped Out and thought nothing of buying the virtual doughnuts on offer . He said: 'Theo is only just eight and has no real concept of the monetary value attached. 'As far as he was concerned he was just buying doughnuts. 'We know others caught out by the same thing. A friend's little girl spent £350 on a horse game. 'One add-on was £69.95 for a little diamond to go in the horse's mane. It's outrageous. 'iPads can be great for keeping them occupied but there has to be more control. 'If you buy something on Amazon you have to agree to pay for it, enter additional information to pay and then get a confirmation email so you can keep track. With the iPad it seems to be a free-for-all. 'I appreciate children are their target audience but it is not right and there needs to be specific controls in place to stop this from happening. 'I dread to think how many people this has happened to and how many it has happened to and they don't even know about it because perhaps it was £50 and they didn't realise.' Furious: Theo's parents were left astonished to find that their son had completely cleared their bank account by racking up a £980 bill on the game, pictured . The family have now been refunded, having spent almost an hour on the phone to Apple representatives in America -  but the iPad, for now, remains in a drawer. A spokesman for Apple said such incidents should be reported as soon as possible and were then looked at on a case-by-case basis. He said it was vital people kept their pass code, designed to stop unauthorised electronic purchases on its products, safe and said software was available to prevent children from using the iTunes store even if they have the password. He said: 'I explained exactly what had happened and it was a nervous wait but they agreed to refund it in the circumstances. Pricey: Danny Kitchen, 5, ran up a huge bill on the iPad app Zombie vs Ninja . The one saving grace for Theo is that he is not the first youngster to amass a huge amount of money on his parents' computer. Last month, five-year-old Danny . Kitchen, from Bristol, made 19 purchases totalling more than £1,300 for extra software . to help him play the game Zombie. Danny had asked his father for a passcode to download a game called Zombies v Ninja, which involves touching the iPad screen to aim ninja-style weapons at cartoon zombies. His parents then left him occupied while they entertained friends at their home. But by pressing a shopping trolley icon on the screen, Danny was offered the chance to buy extra animated ‘ammunition’. He bought dozens of in-game ‘weapons’ and ‘keys’ which cost up to £69.99 a time. His parents were refunded after they contacted Apple. The problem is of increasing concern in the U.S. It emerged last month that Apple is to pay £66million in compensation to parents in America whose children run up massive bills using its free apps. Now as many as 23million people are eligible for a refund. However, the decision is unlikely to affect British families. A US legal case was triggered by a nine-year-old girl from Pennsylvania who bought $200 (£132) of 'virtual money' from three free Apple games. In a lawsuit brought by her father, the games were described as 'highly addictive' and designed to 'compel' children to buy game currency. Under the terms of the case settlement, Apple has now agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $100million (£66million). 'We got Theo and his sister Evie an iPad to help with their schoolwork but Theo's is away in a drawer at the moment. We just don't have time to monitor what they are playing.' Last month, five-year-old Danny Kitchen made 19 purchases totalling more than £1,300 for extra software to help him play the game Zombie. His parents were also refunded after they contacted Apple. A statement on Apple's website reads: 'All iOS devices (iPad, iPhone and iPod touch) have built in parental controls that give parents and guardians the ability to restrict access to content, eg internet access and age-rated content such as music, games, apps, TV shows, movies etc. 'Parental controls also give parents and guardians the option to turn off functionality such as purchasing from iTunes and the ability to turn off in-app purchases. 'Our parents' guide to iTunes details the steps and measures parents and guardians can take to make sure younger players have access to the right content. The first thing we recommend is not to share your password.'","Theo Rowland-Fry bought the virtual doughnuts to progress on the game .

"PUBLISHED: . 10:55 EST, 16 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:58 EST, 16 August 2013 . A 12-year-old girl barred from playing football for her school because of her gender is fighting back with the help of a civil liberties group. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is throwing its weight behind the case of Makhaela Jenkins whose local authority claims it is not being sexist because there are other sports girls can do instead of football. Makhaela already plays youth football in the Baltimore area, south east of Columbus, Ohio, but is not allowed to join the active roster for her school team because of her gender. Barred: Youth footballer Makhaela Jenkins, 12, is fighting an Ohio district policy that bans her from playing football for her school . The district's policy is that only boys can participate in football games and contact drills. According to Fox 28 Columbus, the ACLU has written to the school and labelled its principles as being old-fashioned. Jennifer Martinez Atzberger, ACLU of Ohio senior staff attorney, quoted by the news service, said: 'This school is using outdated and untrue stereotypes about gender to decide who participates in athletics.' She added: 'Federal courts in Ohio have made it clear since the 1970’s that if a girl wants to play football, and there is not an equivalent team for girls, she must be allowed to try out for the boys' team.' Makhaela, who has been playing mixed youth football for some time and has earned her place in the team, is popular with the coach and has earned the blessing of her family, also has the law on her side, Atzberger pointed out to Fox 28. The ACLU member highlighted a similar 1974 case, Clinton v. Nagy, in which a family won a District Court case when their 12-year-old daughter was also stopped from playing football on a municipal team because of her sex. Full Contact: Makhaela Jenkins has been playing youth football but her school will not allow her to play for its team. The school district says it offers girls other non-contact sports to take part in. Pictured, a tackle between New England Patriots and the Baltimore Ravens during the 2013 AFC Championship game . The letter was sent yesterday to Liberty Union-Thurston School District. Quoted in a Fox News article, the district's superintendent Paul Mathews claims their policy does not infringe any gender-related violations because the district offers other, non-contact sports for girls. 'We have opportunities for girls, but those opportunities do not include contact sports,' he told Fox News. The school district's board members have not yet publicly responded to the ACLU's letter, the news service said.","Makhaela Jenkins plays youth football but her school has barred her from games because of her gender .

You may be trying to get in shape and lose weight in order to find love... but you might need to let yourself go a little in order to keep it. Overweight people are less likely to file for divorce than their more slender peers, according to a study. Couples whose individual weights sit between 101 and 200lbs - considered 'physically fit' - are three times more likely to end their marriage than those of any other size, according to online separation service Mydivorcepapers.com. Couples who are considered physically fit are the most likely to divorce, while those who are overweight tend to stay together more . The site found that out of 2,708 cases, 2,054 involved individuals in that weight bracket: almost 76 per cent. People weighing between 201 and 250lbs accounted for 493 of the cases (18.21 per cent), and only 143 divorce cases involved people weighing over 250lb (just over five per cent). The results seem to intimate that happy people eat more - evidence backed up by further recent research which found that 60 per cent of people put on weight when they are in a comfortable relationship. Some . 62 per cent of people admit gaining up to a stone since being in a . relationship, while 72 per cent also think their partner has put on . weight. Part of this seems to be to do with mirroring your beloved's eating habits - 52 per cent of women say they often eat the same amount as . their male partner, and 56 per cent admit this means they eat much . larger portions than they would normally - but another reason seems to be a drop in physical activity. Upon entering into a happy relationship, 30 per cent of couples say their main . activity together becomes staying in and watching television, while 20 per . cent state eating out together as a key bonding pastime. More than 60 per cent of people put on weight when they are in a comfortable relationship and 72 per cent also think their partner has put on weight since the start of their relationship . The research, commissioned by Diet Chef, also revealed that 66 per cent of couples think they have put on weight together. This makes being in a relationship the most common cause of weight gain, beating comfort eating, lack of exercise, and holidays. Izzy . Cameron, Nutrition and Weight Management Specialist at Diet Chef said: . ‘This survey has revealed some very interesting results, and it’s . surprising to see how complacent people can be when they are in a . relationship. ‘It’s . widely known that people tend to put on a little bit of weight once they . have found love, but what we didn't expect to find was that the weight . gain is on average a stone, if not more.","People weighing 101 to 200lbs three times more likely to end marriage .

A Christian bakery that refused to make a lesbian couple a tiered wedding cake because it would violate their 'religious beliefs' is being investigated. Oregon's Bureau of Labor and Industries' civil rights division is reviewing whether  Sweet Cakes by Melissa discriminated against same-sex newlyweds Rachel and Laurel Bowman-Cryer based on their sexual orientation. Despite receiving death threats since the incident occurred in January, owner Aaron Klein, 33, maintains he would rather shut down his shop than 'be forced to do something that violates [his] conscience', according to NBC. Religious? Bakery owners Aaron and Melissa Klein refused to serve a same-sex couple because they believe it would have violated their Christian values . What would Jesus say? Bakery owners Aaron and Melissa Klein have received death threats after refusing to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple . According to her complaint to the state, Rachel Bowman-Cryer, 30, met with the bakery's owner Aaron Klein on January 17 to order a wedding cake. Klein, who runs the Gresham business with his wife Melissa Klein,  asked for the date of the wedding and names of the bride and groom. 'I told him, 'There are two brides and our names are Rachel and Laurel,''' Bowman-Cryer said, according to her complaint, reported by The Oregonian. She said Klein claimed his cake shop did not service same-sex weddings. 'Respondent cited a religious belief for its refusal to make cakes for same-sex couples planning to marry,' the complaint said. Klein confirmed to NBC he refused to serve Bowman-Cryer, but denies calling the couple 'abominations', which was alleged in the formal complaint. 'I . stopped what I was doing, I looked at them and said, 'I'm sorry I may . have wasted your time, we don't do same-sex marriages,''' he said. 'It's discrimination': Newlyweds Laurel and Rachel Bowman-Cryer, left to right, complained to the state when Sweet Cakes by Melissa refused to serve them based on their sexual orientation . Abusive: Laurel and Rachel Bowman-Cryer, left to right, were devastated when the bakery owner allegedly called them 'abominations' The Kleins have received death threats, had the . bakery picketed, received hate mail and lost 50 per cent of their customers since the incident was first reported - yet they still believe their 'homophobic' customer service approach is appropriate. They say they have the right to serve who they want. 'I believe that marriage is a religious institution ordained by God. The Book of Genesis talks about that for this reason: A man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife,' NPR reported Klein as saying. 'That, to me, is the beginning, the basis of marriage . 'We're struggling, but in the end, my faith is more important to me than a dollar. So I will continue to stand for what I believe in. 'And I don't think anybody is ever going to force me to go against my religion.' Backlash: The Kleins say business has dropped by 50 per cent at Sweet Cakes by Melissa since they refused to serve a lesbian couple . Authorities will investigate whether the business violated the Oregon Equality Act of 2007, which protects the rights of gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people in employment, housing and public accommodations. If the complaint is upheld, the inquiry could be referred for prosecution or a settlement may be negotiated. 'It's definitely not discrimination at . all. We don't have anything against lesbians or homosexuals,' Melissa Klein told The Oregonian. 'It has to do with our morals and beliefs. It's so frustrating because . we went through all of this in January, when it all came out.' This is reportedly the 10th complaint to the state in the last five years involving allegations of discrimination in a public place based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian said people are entitled to their beliefs, but aren't allowed to discriminate. 'The goal is never to shut down a business. The goal is to rehabilitate,' Avakian told The Oregonian. 'For those who do violate the law, we want them to learn from that experience and have a good, successful business in Oregon.'","Christian bakery Sweet Cakes by Melissa refused to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple .

David Cameron has revealed he will allow his children to have Facebook accounts – but only if he can monitor what they post. The Prime Minister said he was worried that holiday snaps uploaded to social networking sites could stop his three children from securing jobs in future. He also revealed he has started talking to his nine-year-old daughter Nancy about the pressures put on young girls by images of women in the media. Snaps: David Cameron, who is worried about the impact of embarrassing holiday photos on future job prospects, was pictured last week buying squid with wife Samantha in Portugal . Dangers: The Prime Minister said he was worried about his children's access to the internet, including using his iPad . Mr Cameron has spearheaded a government crackdown on 'poisonous' websites which he says are 'corroding childhood'. In a major speech last week he announced every householder connected to the internet will have their access to online porn blocked unless they ask to receive it. Pornography depicting rape will be outlawed. But in an interview with Grazia magazine Mr Cameron insisted children could not be shielded from the internet entirely. He allows Nancy, Arthur aged seven and Florence, who will be three next month, to use an iPad but none have mobile phones. Worries: The Prime Minister, pictured carrying daughter Florence, revealed his concern about the impact of images of women in the media . Asked if his children will be allowed . to use Facebook when they are older, the PM replied: ‘Yes. I think . Facebook is a way that lots of people communicate. I’m sounding like a . total fogey now. ‘All I . want is to able to see their Facebook pages to start with. When we were . young we went on holiday and took pictures and put them in a cupboard, . and every now and then you got them out. ‘Now everyone shows their pictures on Facebook, they need to think: well, what about that job interview [in the future]?’ Ironically Mr Cameron was mocked last week for his own holiday photos after he was pictured in a Portuguese fish market with his wife. Under Facebook rules, children can only create an account when they are 13. But thousands of youngsters are thought to sign up, often without their parents' knowledge. Mr Cameron revealed he and wife Samantha already talk to eldest daughter Nancy about images of women in the media. ‘It’s just good advice about judging people by what they do and say and not how they look.’ In his speech last week Mr Cameron unveiled plans for tougher web filtering or explicit porn sites. But he suggests the restrictions could go further, to cover sites which promote self-harm. He adds: ‘I worry about my children buying things, as happens now with in-app purchase. ‘You’ve set up some football game and the next thing you know you own half of Real Madrid.’ Snapped: The Prime Minister - who has been criticised in the past for his choice of holiday wear - last week wore a pair of loafers (worn without socks) for the visit to the Portuguese fish market . He went on: ‘Porn has always been . available, boys have always tried to get hold of top-shelf magazines, . but this is happening much earlier. ‘There . are expectations about what sex is, about what relationships are, being . altered by this stuff because children aren’t old enough to process it . properly.’ ‘That has a very corrosive effect: forming loving relationships is one of the most important things that can happen.’ Mr Cameron also suggests there needs to be a ‘national dialogue’ about jokes which make light of rape and sexual violence, in the same way that racism in comedy has been stamped out. ‘Jokes about race were told when I was a boy that are now completely unacceptable, and that’s right,’ he added.","PM reveals he will let his children use social network when they are older .

"Advert was supposed to promote new iX35 which has 100 per cent water emissions . Video depicted a man failing to commit suicide by breathing in fumes . Company has apologised blaming outside ad-agency for the error . By . James Daniel . PUBLISHED: . 19:12 EST, 26 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:48 EST, 27 April 2013 . Hyundai has been forced to remove an advert for one of its cars showing a man attempting to commit suicide after outraged customers complained to the company. The Korean automaker said the ad was posted in an effort to 'get consumers feedback'. The commercial showed a man shutting himself in his car and trying to take his own life by suffocating himself. Bad taste: Hyundai has been forced to apologise for an advert trying to promote the zero carbon emissions of one of its cars by featuring a man failing to commit suicide . The aim of the short film was to promote the hydrogen fuel call car's water emissions of one of Hyundai's vehicles. The emissions released by the car are water as opposed to the carbon monoxide released by petrol engines, which is potentially lethal if inhaled. In the world of advertising, there's a fine line between the creative and the insensitive. Hyundai has released several apology statements. 'Hyundai Motor deeply and sincerely apologizes for the offensive viral film. The ad was created by an affiliate advertising agency, Innocean Europe, without Hyundai’s request or approval. The film runs counter to our values as a company and as members of the community. We are very sorry for any offense or distress the video caused. More to the point, Hyundai apologizes to those who have been personally impacted by tragedy.' Hyundai said in a statement. A separate statement was also released by the company in North America: . 'We at Hyundai Motor America are shocked and saddened by the depiction of a suicide attempt in an inappropriate European video featuring a Hyundai. Suicide merits thoughtful discussion, not this type of treatment.' BlatAnt: The commercial makes it clear that the man intended to kill himself by breathing in the exhaust fumes from his car . Failed: The advert ends with the man getting out of his vehicle and returning inside having failed to kill himself . The company has said the commercial never appeared on the company website or their own YouTube channel. The advert has since been removed from YouTube and MailOnline is not showing the video. The commercial for the ix35 commercial was called 'Pipe Job'. The ad ends with an exterior shot of the house as the garage lights turn on and the door opens. The Future? The advert was supposed to showcase Hyundai's new ix35 Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV), the first hydrogen-powered fuel cell car . As he walks back inside, his suicide attempt apparently unsuccessful, the tagline reads 'The ix35 with 100 per cent water emissions' appears on the screen. The one-minute video was made by a German ad agency Innocean. The firm has also released a statement justifying their cause: . 'This viral film was created and posted on Youtube for one day by Innocean Worldwide Europe to  get consumers’ feedback on creative idea employing hyperbole to dramatize a product advantage without any other commercial purpose.' Although many have criticised the company for being insensitive, at least one commentator on YouTube pointed out the effectiveness of the advertisement’s message. 'I know how controversial this advert is . becoming and whether you agree with it or not it’s worked,' the comment . read. 'You cannot deny that. The job is done and everyone now knows . about the new Hyundai with 100 percent water emissions. Advertising at . its best.' Shifting the blame: Hyundai say the advert for its Hyundai's hydrogen-powered car was produced by an outside ad agency . Hyundai has apologized and pulled an ad that portrayed a man trying to commit suicide. The video was made by a German ad agency and was supposed to advertise the company's new hydrogen-powered vehicles. Holly Brockwell, who identified herself as a digital copywriter in London, wrote on her blog that she felt 'sick' after watching the advert, saying her father had committed suicide when she was a child. 'I understand better than most people the need to do... something talkable, even something outrageous to get those all-important viewing figures. What I don't understand is why a group of strangers have just brought me to tears in order to sell me a car,' she said in an open letter to Hyundai and Innocean. 'My dad never drove a Hyundai. Thanks to you, neither will I.'

Up for grabs: A vial that once contained valium prescribed to Elvis Presley the year before he collapsed and died that is set to be auctioned . These small amber vials contained the drugs that led to music legend Elvis Presley's downfall and death. The two-inch plastic pots held pills prescribed to The King for anxiety and insomnia in 1976, a year before he was found dead aged 42 at his famous Graceland home. At the time, Elvis had been taking a cocktail of prescription drugs in an attempt to cope with his dwindling music and film career. Two tiny pots and a card box which . once contained the drugs are now up for sale and are expected to sell . for upwards of £3,000 when they go under the hammer. One . pot contained 10mg tablets of relaxant valium while the other held 40mg . pills of Inderal, a beta blocker used for hypertension and the . prevention of heart attacks. The box used to house a 10ml vial of Vernate, a drug injected to prevent coronary disease and aid digestion. The labels on the vials are printed with the names 'E. Presley' and 'Elvis Presley'. They were supplied by The Prescription House in Madison Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee, around seven miles from Graceland. The . bottles, which have come from Elvis's estate, are labelled with the instruction 'use as directed' and were ordered by Dr George . Nichopoulos, the star's controversial personal physician. Dr . Nichopoulos famously tried to revive Elvis after discovering his . lifeless body on August 16, 1977. He later faced trial in 1980 for . overprescribing drugs to the star. The . trial revealed that in 1977 alone, Nichopoulos had prescribed The King . over 10,000 doses of drugs including amphetamines and barbiturates, . narcotics and tranquilisers. Nichopoulos, dubbed Dr Feelgood by the media, was initially cleared of any wrongdoing but had his licence revoked in 1995 on the same grounds.

Passengers on a Qantas jet flying over Australia got a shock when they spotted a 12ft python clinging on to a wing at 30,000ft. The plane was around 20 minutes into its flight from Cairns in northern Australia to Papua New Guinea when a female passenger first announced she could see the reptile. Those on board could only watch as the snake - thought to be a Scrub Python - spent the flight battling to survive in freezing conditions. Scroll down to watch! Bizarre: Passengers were shocked to see the snake - thought to be a Scrub Python - hanging from one of the plane's wings . Cold: Passengers could only look on as the reptile battled to survive during the flight from Cairns in northern Australia to Papa New Guinea . Fight: The snake is thought to have got into a landing gear cavity to keep warm before the plane took off . Unlike in the Hollywood movie, Snakes on a Plane, which featured a nest of vipers causing havoc when they escaped inside a jet - this reptile was more concerned about keeping itself alive . The snake fought to find some shelter from the 300mph wind as temperatures dropped to as low as  -12C°. Passenger Robert Weber told the Sydney Morning Herald that people at the rear of the plane were totally focused on the snake and were asking how it could have got there. 'There was no panic,' he said, 'at no time did anyone stop to consider there might be others on board.' Mr Weber said that at first the snake . must have been tucked itself away in a small space near the wing but . that the wind must pulled him 'straight out,' he told the newspaper. What followed, said Mr Weber, was a life and death struggle for the snake. Worry: Even a pilot reportedly took a look at the python as it tried to pull itself to safety . Injured: The snake's battered body hangs limply from the wing after the plane landed in Papua New Guinea - with blood stains visible around it. It was nevertheless thought to be still alive . 'I felt quite sad for it really,' he said, 'for the remainder of the trip he was trying to pull himself back into the plane.' Despite the cold and wind, he said, the snake still managed to hang on, but each time it managed to pull itself back into a cavity, the wind forced it out again. Snakes - such as this Black Mamba - have cold blood, which could have helped the scrub python survive its epic plane journey . It is unclear exactly how the python survived his freezing plane journey to Papua New Guinea - but as a cold blooded (or 'poikilothermic') creature its ability to alternate its body temperature to cope with its environment would have helped. Cold-blooded creatures are much more active in warm environments and slow down in cold environments. Mammals, including humans, by contrast are homoiothermic, or 'warm-blooded' and try to maintain a constant body temperature. At one point the pilot came out into the main cabin and took a look a the wing snake - which he said 'should be dead,' given the battering it had taken. But, amazingly, when the plane touched down in Port Moresby the snake was still moving. It was not immediately known what happened to the reptile but passengers suspected it would have been destroyed by Papua New Guinea quarantine officials. Australian snake experts said it was a non - toxic scrub python, the longest snake species in Australia, which are common in North Queensland. Paul Cousins, who represents an aircraft engineers' association, told the Herald the snake had probably crawled up inside the landing bay before crawling into the trailing ledge flap assembly. 'Nice and warm there,' he said, 'but [as] the plane later takes off, the flaps move back and he' s probably become shaken because of all the noise and vibration. Once he's moved,  he's become caught in the wind.'","Passengers spot snake on plane's wing during flight from Australia .

At risk: Women with so-called 'cancer genes', like actress Angelina Jolie, should consider having their fallopian tubes removed to guard against a heightened risk of ovarian cancer, an expert said today . Women with so-called 'cancer genes' should consider having their fallopian tubes removed to guard against a heightened risk of ovarian cancer, an expert said today. Women found to be carrying the BRCA1 or 2 genes, such as actress Angelina Jolie, should think about that course of action providing they have had children, it was claimed. Professor Sean Kehoe, one of the UK's leading gynaecological oncologists, pointed to 'a groundswell of evidence' suggesting the disease often starts in the fallopian tubes of women carrying the genes and not the ovaries as previously thought. The professor, from the University of Birmingham, said: 'Women who carry the BRCA1 gene are currently advised to have their ovaries removed by the time they are 40; whilst carriers of the BRCA2 gene are advised to have them removed no later than 50. 'This procedure normally includes removal of the fallopian tubes. 'There may be certain situations whereby removal of the fallopian tube at an earlier age than that recommended for the ovaries be deemed appropriate - but there is a need to investigate this further.' He added: 'More research is needed to show that this approach would provide a worthwhile reduction in their risk of developing ovarian cancer, but based on recent findings there is evidence to support this concept. 'One disadvantage would be the need for two operations, hence the need to research this in much more detail.' Ovarian cancer is known as the silent killer because its symptoms often present too late for effective intervention. Up to 7,000 women a year are diagnosed with the disease and 4,500 die. One in 10 ovarian cancers are caused by an inherited faulty gene. Jolie is the latest and most high-profile star to highlight the dilemma facing women at high risk of developing breast cancer. The star revealed in May that she had undergone a preventative double mastectomy to reduce her risk of developing the disease. Her mother Marcheline Bertrand died of cancer in 2007. Jolie, a mother of six and partner of Brad Pitt, said she took the decision to have the procedure because she found she carries BRCA1, which sharply increases her risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Tragedy: Pierce Brosnan's daughter Charlotte, far right, has died of ovarian cancer, the same disease claimed her mother Cassie, centre, 22 years ago . Writing for the New York Times, she . said her doctors had estimated she had an 87 per cent risk of developing . breast cancer and a 50 per cent risk of ovarian cancer. Professor . Kehoe said: 'Recent studies suggest that the fallopian tubes may be the . source of up to 50 per cent of so-called ovarian cancers though . research is ongoing. 'Pre-cancerous changes have certainly been noted in the fallopian tubes of BRCA carriers when carefully examined. 'Unfortunately there are no diagnostic tests for identifying pre-cancerous or early cancerous cells i the fallopian tubes which would explain why the disease so often goes undetected until it has spilled out of the end of the tubes on to the ovaries and around the abdomen. 'Only then do symptoms develop. Tragically, by this time, the outcome is poor. 'Generally speaking, women with the BRCA gene mutation have a lifetime risk of breast cancer up to 90 per cent, and their risk of ovarian cancer is between 10 and 40 per cent. However, preventative measures mean the risks are hugely reduced. 'Unfortunately, there is no effective screening process for detecting pre-cancerous or early cancerous changes in the fallopian tubes. 'Blood tests may one day help in screening or early diagnosis of cancer in the fallopian tubes in the future but the technology is not yet that advanced.' Growth: This scan shows a huge ovarian cancer, pictured round and green at top centre . Liz Campbell, director of the charity Wellbeing of Women, which funds studies into the treatment and prevention of ovarian cancer, said: 'This is a very exciting development in thinking which needs funding now so that research can establish whether it offers new treatments for women suffering with this terrible disease.' Dr James Brenton, a Cancer Research UK ovarian cancer expert, said: 'Removing the fallopian tube from women with a BRCA fault could reduce their risk of developing ovarian cancer without the side effects that removing the ovaries would have. 'But there have been no studies to show how effective this could be. Any woman who carries a BRCA fault should speak to her doctor to discuss the possibilities for them. There are things that can reduce women's risk of ovarian cancer, for example taking the pill for around three years before a woman is 30 cuts her risk of developing the disease. 'And we need to understand more about BRCA faults and ovarian cancer. As sequencing DNA gets cheaper it will transform our knowledge of ovarian cancer and how we treat the disease. 'We're looking at testing all women who have ovarian cancer to see if they have a BRCA fault and whilst this won't affect their treatment, it will mean that if any of their family members are found to be carrying a fault they can take steps to reduce their risk of developing a cancer linked to BRCA faults - breast, ovarian and prostate.'","Women carrying BRCA1 or 2 genes should remove fallopian tubes .

Up to 74 girls in Afghanistan have been treated after a suspected poisoning attack at their school, officials said yesterday. The girls became ill after smelling gas at their school, Bibi Maryam, in Takhar province's capital, Taluqan. Many of the children remained in a critical condition in hospital last night. Up to 74 girls fell ill after smelling gas at their school in a suspected poisoning attack in northern Afghanistan . Several of the girls remain in a critical condition after the latest suspected attack on women in education . The Ministry of Public Health is investigating and samples of the victims' blood have been sent for testing. Sulaiman Moradi, Takhar governor's spokesman, said the attack was to try to prevent girls from going to school. He said 'enemies of the government and the country' were to blame for the mass illness. There have been numerous substantiated cases of mass poisonings of schoolgirls in Afghanistan by ultra-conservatives who oppose giving women access to education. The girls in Takhar, about 155 miles north of Kabul, were taken to a provincial hospital. Most were released after being treated but Dr Jamil Frotan, head of the hospital, said several victims remained in a critical condition yesterday. Numerous attacks on girls' schools have been reported in Afghanistan by ultra-conservatives who oppose women's education. Girls began learning in school after the Taliban were ousted in 2001 (file picture) Twelve years after the Taliban were ousted and female education became legal, attacks on girl students, their teachers and school buildings continue. Such is the concern over the number of attacks, that in 2011 President Hamid Karzai urged the Taliban to stop targeting schools. Last year, 160 schoolgirls were hospitalised after their classrooms were sprayed with a toxic gas in a suspected Taliban attack. The girls, aged between ten and 20-years-old, complained of headaches, vomiting and dizziness, with scores left unconscious. Teachers and guards in many schools are so wary of poisoning that they test the water and air quality each morning before allowing the pupils inside. Two years ago, 185 attacks on schools and hospitals were recorded in the country - many of them targeting girls' schools. Acid attacks on girls walking to school have also been known in Afghanistan. In 2009, three teams of men on motorbikes sprayed acid from water bottles on pupils and teachers. He said: 'We have already sent samples of . their blood to the Ministry of Public Health and it will soon become . clear what the reason for their illness was.' The apparent poisoning came three days after more than a dozen students fell ill in another girls' high school in Taluqan. No-one has claimed responsibility for either incident. Four poisoning attacks on a girls' school in Takhar were reported between May and June last year prompting local officials to order principals to stay in school until late. Staff were also told to search the grounds for suspicious objects and to test the water. Takhar has been a hotbed of militancy and criminal activity since 2009, with groups such as the Taliban and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan active. The Taliban banned education for women and girls but since they were ousted in 2001, females have returned to schools, especially in the capital city Kabul. Afghan women have won back basic . rights in education, voting and employment since 2001. However, fears are . growing that such gains could be traded away as Western forces prepare . to leave and the Afghan government seeks peace talks with the Taliban.","The girls were treated after smelling gas at their school in Takhar province .

Pope John Paul II has finally approved for Sainthood thanks to a Costa Rican woman who claims the late Pope cured her fatal brain aneurysm. Floribeth Mora, now 50, made a miraculous recovery from a potentially deadly aneurysm in her cerebral artery two years ago, after a photograph of John Paul II spoke to her, she claims. Mora's recovery, which her doctor attests there is no scientific basis for, was finally recognized by the Vatican as a valid second miracle for the late Pope's sainthood. Floribeth Mora holds up a magazine featuring Pope John Paul II on the cover, who she claims miraculously cured her of a brain aneurysm . Mora was diagnosed with a swelling in her brain in April 2011, she told reporters at Roman Catholic Church's headquarters in San Jose. Though originally thought to be a severe migraine, after three days of pain, Mora returned to the hospital, where a series of tests revealed an aneurysm on the right side of her brain that had begun to hemorrhage. Doctors then told Mora that she would die within the month, she told Reuters. Mora was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm that she says doctors told her would kill her within a month. However, she claims that the late Pope John Paul II spoke to her and cured her disease . 'I returned home with the horror of imminent death. Seeing my children walking by looking at me, standing beside my bed, seeing my husband making himself strong, taking my hand and crossing himself every night, it was very sad,' Mora said. Mora went on to testify that after watching the beatification of Pope John Paul II on television she heard a voice speak from his picture on the cover of a magazine. Mora fell asleep after watching the mass and when she awoke heard a voice from the picture of John Paul II which sat on top of her television saying 'get up,' Floribeth Mora (center) recounted the miracle to reporters through tears as he family and Archbishop Hugo Barrantes (left) gathered around her for support . Mora held onto a gold rosary as she recounted how after hearing a voice speak to her from John Paul II's picture her fatal disease was instantly cured . 'I woke up when I heard a voice that said 'get up,'' Mora told reporters holding up a news clipping. 'I was alone in my room, I only had this clipping that was published around those dates to commemorate John Paul II's papacy.' ""I had it in front of me and I heard a voice again that said 'get up' and I looked at his photo and saw his open arms and I heard a voice that said 'be not afraid' and I said 'Yes Lord,'' she said through tears. Mora claims that after the picture spoke to her she instantly knew she was cured. Costa Rican Floribeth Mora --who says she was healed by a miracle attributed to late Pope John Paul II-- cries upon receiving a gift from a catholic faithful after a press conference at the archbishop's house in San Jose . Mora's (front left) husband Edwin Arce (front right) told reporters that many have doubted the veracity of the miracle over the past two years . 'I went to my husband and he asked me what I was doing and I just said 'I feel fine, I feel fine, I feel fine,'' she said. The Costa Rican grandmother claims that miracle took place after she was told by doctors that she had less than a month to live, a written statement distributed by the church attests. However, her neurosurgeon, Alejandro Vargas, denies he ever told his pious patient any such thing. Though Vargas does admit Mora's condition was potentially fatal, he says he predicted only a two percent chance that the aneurysm would kill her, possibly bleeding into her brain within a year of the diagnosis, Reuters reported. Mora, 50, cried as she told reporters of the miracle the late John Paul II performed on her as he was finally made eligible for sainthood . 'She was sent home with medication that would reduce her blood pressure and was advised to improve her diet so as not to raise her cholesterol levels and thus decrease the chance of her having a second bleeding episode,' Dr. Vargas told the news service. 'She was sedated because the headaches were too sharp. We didn't send her home to be sedated and wait until she died in her sleep.' However the neurologist does admit that Mora's recovery is inexplicable from a medical standpoint. 'The risk for Floribeth was death, or ending up with significant neurological damage,' Dr. Vagas said. Doctor's believed that Mora (staring here at a bust of Pope John Paul II) would die from the hemorrhaging of her aneurysm before it was miraculously cured . Seen here is the altar of Pope John Paul II the Mora's set up on their front porch. In front of the Pope's picture is the doctor's letter diagnosing Mora with a brain aneurysm . 'What we found remarkable, unbelievable really, was that by November there was absolutely no trace in her brain that she ever had an aneurysm,' he told Reuters. 'I had never seen this in my career.' Mora, who at the press conference wore gold rosary beads, posted about her miracle on a blog dedicated to Pope John Paul II, and it was soon picked up as a rallying point for Catholics who supported his canonization. However, according to Mora's husband Erwin Arce not everyone was so quick to accept a miracle had occurred. 'We've faced a lot of non-believers these last two years,' Arce told Reuters. Pope John Paul II, who died in 2005, was finally declared a saint by the Vatican after his second miracle of curing a Costa Rican woman of a nearly fatal brain aneurysm was recognized . Pope John Paul II was one of the fastest Pope's to ever be canonized after his death, in a period of only 8 years . The night Mora heard the Pope's voice her family constructed a shrine to him on their porch, which now includes the original doctor's note diagnosing Mora with a brain aneurysm, the news service reported. Theis latest miracle approved by Pope Francis will make Pope John Paul II one of the fastest members of the Catholic church to achieve sainthood, USA Today reported. Pope John Paul II died in 2005. The Vatican also announced that along with John Paul II, John XXIII will be canonized, the paper reported. John XXIII was pope from 1958 to 1963 and though he doesn't have two confirmed miracles under his belt, Francis waved the rules as he believe John XXIII deserved sainthood based on his own merits, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombard told the paper. The two Popes will be canonized within the year according to the Vatican.","Costa Rican woman Floribeth Mora claims she was cured of a near fatal brain aneurysm by the Pope John Paul II .

Political parties faced demands to review all bequests last night after the Tories and Lib Dems were shamed into handing back a spinster’s £520,000 legacy. They gave up the cash after being accused of ‘robbery’ for pocketing the proceeds of 91-year-old Joan Edwards’s will, in a case highlighted yesterday by the Daily Mail. When she died last year, the former NHS nurse left her estate to ‘whichever Government is in office’ to ‘use as they may think fit’. But instead of putting it into the Health Service or improving schools, the Coalition parties carved it up as a political donation. The Tories banked £420,000 and the Lib Dems took £100,000. Prime Minister David Cameron (left) has given in to howls of protest and said the Tories would give up to the Treasury their share of the money left by former NHS nurse Joan Edwards (right) Party spin doctors had tried to suggest Miss Edwards had meant her legacy to benefit ‘whichever party’ was in power. But after the Mail revealed the true wording of the will, David Cameron gave in to the howls of protest and said the Tories would give up their share to the Treasury, ‘so it can help to pay down the national debt, which I think meets the spirit of what this very generous lady meant’. It immediately prompted calls to examine other recent bequests to the main parties – there were 401 in the past decade. Paul Flynn, a Labour member of the public administration select committee, said the case cast a shadow of doubt over them. He added: ‘All parties should go back through their bequests to check and ensure that there is no doubt at all over who was the intended beneficiary of the money.’ Young donor: Party spin doctors had tried to suggest Miss Edwards (pictured in 1931) had meant her legacy to benefit 'whichever party' was in power . Home: Miss Edwards had lived in the same three-bedroom semi-detached council house (pictured) since 1931, when she moved in with her parents . ‘MPs face a long battle to regain public trust after the expenses scandal, and this is not going to help. If doubts remain, then the stench will remain.’ Tory MP Conor Burns said: ‘I am sure all political parties will want to go back and check. In the light of the expenses scandal, politicians have to be so careful to be transparent about where their money came from. ‘This case has reinforced the public’s impression about politics and politicians, which isn’t a good one.’ Robert Oxley, campaign director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers who leave a little extra for public services when they are gone don’t expect their cash to be diverted into politicians’ election war chests.’ 'Doubt': Labour MP Paul Flynn (left) said the case cast a shadow of doubt over the 401 bequests to the main parties made in the past decade. Tory MP Conor Burns (right) said the case had 'reinforced the public's impression about politics and politicians, which isn't a good one' The Lib Dems and Tories began the day yesterday clinging to the idea they would keep the cash, but they soon came under a barrage of criticism, including from their own MPs. Mr Burns said on Twitter: ‘Whoever decided to accept a penny of Joan Edwards’s money for the party has very poor judgment. We must return it before the morning is out.’ Steve Webb, the Lib Dem pensions minister, said Miss Edwards’s wishes should be ‘honoured’, while another Tory, Zac Goldsmith, said: ‘This needs to be sorted out now.’ As the tide turned, the Lib Dems rushed . to be first to claim the moral high ground, announcing shortly before . 11am they were paying their £100,000 share to the Treasury to help pay . off the national debt. Within three minutes, the Tories hurriedly . followed suit. The Prime Minister said: ‘The executors of the will . decided it was right to pay the money to the parties of government, the . Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. ‘But I think when you look at the wording of the will, it seems to us the intention was more to benefit the nation.’ There was a twist in the afternoon when the executors of Miss Edwards’s will, Davis Wood solicitors, announced that she had verbally instructed them in 2001 she wanted her money ‘to be left to whichever political party formed the Government’. But the firm could not explain why there was no mention of any party in the actual will that it had drafted for her. The Law Society’s wills committee chairman Richard Roberts said it was ‘regrettable’ the firm ‘did not actually interpret her instructions clearly’, and Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said there was no ambiguity ‘whatsoever’ in the wording of the will. Her donation of £520,000 suggests that, before inheritance tax was taken off, Miss Edwards, of Bristol, was worth £648,333 when she died. Neighbours said they had ‘absolutely no idea’ the former midwife had been so wealthy. About 20 mourners attended Miss Edwards’s funeral in September 2012. Retired vicar The Reverend Michael Massey, 76, read the following eulogy, which he yesterday gave to the Mail. ‘She was someone who was fiercely independent and would only rarely accept help, even from people she knew well like close neighbours – and then only if it was “absolutely necessary”. ‘All her life she served others, firstly as a school nurse, then as a district nurse and finally, in her best remembered role, as a midwife.’ The vicar concluded: ‘When she died, Joan was 91 years, one month and 12 days old. She served others all her life and they benefited from it. Now she will receive her just reward. May she rest in peace.’ Public-spirited Britons have left £7million to the nation over the past decade, but have bequeathed twice as much to political parties. The £23million total was bequeathed in 401 wills. There is usually no confusion about where the money should go, with wills explicitly spelling out who is to benefit – making it all the more extraordinary that Joan Edwards’ legacy ended up in Tory and Lib Dem coffers. Since 2001, political parties have been left almost £15.7million, according to figures from the Electoral Commission. The Tories received the most – £5.6million – with Labour banking £3.9million. The Scottish National Party were next on £2.4million, followed by the Liberal Democrats on £1.7million. Analysis of a small sample of these wills reveals they were very specific in stating which party their money should go to. Often, the person’s will includes the address of the political party’s headquarters, to rule out any doubt. For example, Ruth Beardmore of Torquay, Devon, who died in January 2004, left £396,409.55 to the Tories. Her will said the money should pass to ‘the Conservative Party of Great Britain of 32 Smith Square, London SW1 absolutely.’ Similarly, Vera Archer of Epsom, Surrey, who died in December 2000, left £100,000 to the Labour Party, and her will states: ‘As to a further quarter of my residuary estate for the Labour Party National Executive of 15 Walworth Road, London, SE17 for the general purposes of the Labour Party.’ But Miss Edwards’ money was handed to political parties when her will did not mention a particular party – and not even the word ‘party’. Her case is not the first in which ambiguity has led to an unseemly scramble to grab a legacy. The Mail has learnt that in 2006 the death of David Grigg, a Welsh gravedigger, led to a debate about his £1million assets, which he bequeathed to ‘the government for the time being of the United Kingdom’. The term ‘time being’ caused difficulties because, when he prepared his will in the 1990s, John Major’s Conservative government was in power. When he died, in March 2006, Labour was running the country. A former Tory adviser involved in the case, who did not want to be named, claimed that some politicians sought to ‘snatch’ the legacy. However, the adviser said Dominic Grieve, now the Attorney General but at the time a member of the Opposition, took the view that the cash was clearly intended for the benefit of the nation. If people want to bequest money to the country, the usual procedure is that the executor of their will notifies the Treasury Solicitor’s department, who are then prepared to receive a cheque made out to ‘HM Treasury’. The £7million left to the nation came mainly from wills that typically stated that legacies should go to ‘the Government’. Over the past 12 years, other recipients of party donations have included Plaid Cymru (£531,000), and the British National Party (£663,000). Noel Kirkby of Brighton, East Sussex, who died in April 2007 leaving £150,000, was particularly specific in his instructions. He wrote that his money should go to the Green Party. The will went on to say that the sum should still go to the party even if it had changed its name or should go to any new party formed by its amalgamation. Had the Green Party ceased to exist, the will stated it should go instead to Friends of the Earth. Bequests: According to figures from the Electoral Commission, political parties have been left almost £15.7m since 2001, with Labour banking £3.9m and the Lib Dems receiving £1.7m .","Joan Edwards left her money to 'whichever Government is in office'

"By . Ben Spencer and Mario Ledwith . PUBLISHED: . 20:45 EST, 24 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:22 EST, 25 January 2013 . Tesco has apologised after one its stores continued to sell a line of burgers that should have been withdrawn in the wake of the horse meat scandal. Customers were alarmed when the own-brand 'Free From' quarter pounder prompted an alert at the checkout, informing them that the 'product has been withdrawn from sale'. But despite the warning, staff at the store in Cowley, Oxfordshire, ignored the system and allowed the customers to purchase the burgers anyway. Apology: Tesco apologised after customers purchased a variety of burger that should have been withdrawn in the wake of the horse meat scandal at its store in Cowley, Oxfordshire . Tesco's error followed news that . prestigious supermarket chain Waitrose has become the latest store to be . drawn into the scandal, as it admitted withdrawing thousands of . burgers. Tesco said it had launched an investigation into how the products remained on sale. The error came to light, when the BBC was contacted by a concerned shopped, known only as David, who had purchased the burgers. After being contacted the reporter was also able to buy the withdrawn product, when a member of staff overrode the block on the product's sale at the til. David said: 'We said to the supervisor at the time we hoped the others will be taken off the shelves and the supervisor said they would make sure it gets done, which obviously it wasn't. The supermarket giant said that the burger in question was not one of those found to contain horse DNA, but that the line had been withdrawn as a precautionary measure. A Tesco spokesman said: 'The burger was not among those that had tested positive for horse DNA in a survey by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, but Tesco had withdrawn it as a precaution and it therefore should not have been on shelves and available for sale. 'The withdrawal was voluntary, and there is no evidence of any food safety problems with any of the burgers that have been removed from sale. 'We sincerely apologise for this, and we have spoken to the store to ensure that this does not happen again.' Waitrose yesterday admitted pulling six product lines from its stores nationwide after its supplier Dalepak was temporarily stripped of its British Retail Association food standards accreditation. Tests: Waitrose said all burgers had been tested and come back negative for horse DNA . The revelations are highly . embarrassing for the store that previously distanced itself from the . scandal and prides itself on the quality of its produce. The upmarket supermarket insisted it is '100 per cent confident' that there was no horse meat in any of its burgers. But the company admitted it had withdrawn its frozen burgers ‘as a precautionary measure’ after learning Dalepak had lost its accreditation. Dalepak is one of three meat processing firms found to have horse DNA in its products and the debacle has affected a growing number of national and international firms. Criticism: Mark Price, managing director of Waitrose, criticised supermarkets for selling cheap food, saying they had 'got the joke that cheap does not mean good value' Waitrose managing director Mark Price had earlier lambasted supermarkets for selling cheap food, and said the horse meat scandal was inevitable due to major supermarkets squeezing their suppliers. Only hours before his own supermarket admitted removing some of their own products, Mr Price said: 'Customers now have got the joke that cheap does not mean good value. Cheap just means cheap.' He added: 'If you have a competition that says, ‘Who can sell the cheapest stuff?’ inevitably you will get something like this. 'What you've seen in UK food retail is packs get smaller. There's less mint in spearmint gum, the taste of chocolate biscuits is not what it was 10 years ago because, guess what, there's less chocolate in it. 'If people are managing to a price point, they will change the specification and they will cheat to get there. We’ve gone the other way.' Although Waitrose's withdrawal came to light yesterday, the products were removed from stores on Monday. An investigation by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland earlier this month found that Tesco had sold burgers contaminated with horse meat. Asda, Sainsbury’s and the Co-op have since withdrawn its burgers as a precaution. Fast food giant Burger King was yesterday accused of covering up its involvement in the horse meat scandal, after admitting it had secretly removed thousands of burgers from sale over the weekend as a precautionary measure, despite previously insisting no products had been withdrawn. A Waitrose spokesman said all burgers had been tested and came back negative for horse DNA. They said: ‘All our beef comes from our own British suppliers - we only use beef from British farms in all our fresh and frozen burgers and ready meals. Stripped: Dalepak is one of three meat processing firms found to have horse DNA in its products . ‘As a consequence we are 100 per cent confident in the integrity of our supply chain. The ingredients in our burgers are simple with all meat traceable back to British farms that we know. ‘Our frozen burgers - which make up eight per cent of our total burger sales - are produced by Dalepak. ‘Our technical team visited the Dalepak site last week and were happy that our products were produced to our high specification and separately from other companies’ products (ours are produced at 6am before other any other burgers). The spokesman added: 'When the BRC [British Retail Consortium] suspended their accreditation of the site we decided - as a precautionary measure - to take our frozen burgers off sale. We understand the accreditation was reinstated on Thursday 24.1.13. ‘As a further precaution our frozen burgers (six lines) were sent for testing and we have just heard that they all tested negative for any species other than beef.’ Content: One of the Tesco burgers consisted of 29 per cent horse meat . Burger King was criticised for . employing ‘shabby’ and ‘outrageous’ tactics in its attempts to escape . being affected by the scandal. Its . burgers, such as its best-selling Whopper, were made by the Irish meat . processor Silvercrest, which is part of the ABP Food Group. Silvercrest . also made burgers for Tesco which were then sold across Britain and . Ireland contaminated with horse meat. Tesco has since apologised for . unknowingly selling the contaminated products. Last . week, when details of the illegal contamination of burgers emerged, . Burger King insisted that its products were not involved and so would . not be withdrawn. However, it has now admitted that it removed thousands of burgers from sale over the weekend as a precautionary measure. Other . retailers supplied by ABP, such as Asda, Sainsbury’s and the Co-op, . were quick to react to the contamination news, removing ten million . burgers from sale as a precautionary measure. Bare: Empty shelves at a Tesco supermarket in Bristol, pictured after staff removed the contaminated burgers from freezer compartments . They took the decision while insisting there was no evidence that their burgers contained horse meat. By . contrast, Burger King, which is estimated to sell 60million burgers in . the UK every year, offered a series of guarantees and ‘absolute . assurances’ to customers that it did not need to do the same. Last . Wednesday, Anna Price, of Burger King’s public relations company Cohn . & Wolfe, issued a statement saying: ‘Burger King Worldwide has been . given absolute assurance by its supplier ABP/Silvercrest that no Burger . King products are affected by the issue.’ Asked specifically by the Daily Mail whether it was withdrawing burgers, Miss Price issued a clear and categorical denial. But . now the firm has admitted it has switched its burger supplier and . warned customers that some products might be in short supply. Burger . King said: ‘As a precaution, this past weekend we decided to replace . all Silvercrest products in the UK & Ireland with products from . another approved Burger King supplier. This is a voluntary and . precautionary measure.’ Shocking: Tests carried out at Silvercrest in Ireland, who supllied Tesco, confirmed that frozen burgers were contaminated . The Department of Agriculture in Ireland revealed that it has taken more than 130 samples of burgers and ingredients in the past week from the Silvercrest facility. Twenty four preliminary results were received late last night from a laboratory in Germany and these have been sent to an Irish lab for confirmation, but results have not been verified. Irish Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney described the investigation as complex. He said: 'I am not prepared to draw any conclusion until I'm fully satisfied that such conclusions are supported by facts. In any food incident the emphasis is always on dealing with the matter thoroughly, promptly and as transparently as possible to ensure that consumer confidence in the integrity of Irish food production is maintained.' Mr Coveney repeated that results to date indicate no presence of equine DNA in raw materials sourced in Ireland. Vet staff from the department have been in the plant trying to identify lists of ingredients used in the batches tested.","Tesco customers purchased withdrawn line at store in Cowley, Oxfordshire .

She's 68 years old, and lists herself as a 'homemaker' on official forms. She's also the owner of a global company with $1.8 billion in revenue annually. When billionaire Fred A. Lennon died at the age of 92 in 1998, the financial world speculated about his will, but so secretive was the industrialist that no one found out who owned his billion-dollar company, Swagelok, until years later. It wasn't until 2002, when his grandson William Lennon took his aunt, Fred's daughter Catherine Lozick, to probate court, that the world discovered how Lennon had divided up his fortune. Secretly successful: The only photo of enigmatic Catherine Lozick (pictured with husband Edward Lozick) that seems to exists online . In a recent Forbes magazine profile, it was revealed that in 1986, Fred Lennon set up a trust for his daughter Catherine Lozick that contained the vast majority of the assets in his estate. She would be the only recipient of income from the trust's assets, and 21 years after Lennon's death, Lozick would inherit the entire trust. The trustees could, at their discretion, hand the trust over to Lozick at an earlier date. Awaiting billions? Lozick's son Thomas Lozick (left) with his wife. Thomas works for the family company Swagelock, which produces pipe fittings and tubing and other fixtures. It also produces billions for the Lozick family . The good life: Lozick and his wife could be the next beneficiaries of the family billions now that his mercurial mom Catherine has been given an estimated $1.7 billion by a trust set up by her secretive father . None of his nine grandchildren were recognized in the will or given any role in the company that made Lennon's fortune, Swagelok, which makes plumbing products such as fittings, valves and hoses. There was one further stipulation: If Lozick died before she assumed ownership of the trust, Lennon's grandchildren would inherit what assets remained in the trust. Founder: Fred Lennon established his company in 1947 and grew it from nothing into a billion-dollar empire before his death in 1998 . It was this condition that prompted William Lennon, one of Fred Lennon's snubbed grandchildren, to bring a case against his aunt attempting to dismantle the trust in 2002. The case was directed at the trustees of his grandfather's assets, whom he accused of mismanagement. However, William Lennon's right to bring the case to court was questioned by the Lozick's lawyer. According to Forbes, David A. Kutik wrote a motion to dismiss the case due to William Lennon's lack of standing. 'If Catherine Lozick survives the 21 years, Plaintiff receives nothing. If the entire Trust is distributed to Catherine Lozick in the Trustee’s . discretion, Plaintiff receives nothing. If Catherine Lozick does not . survive the 21 years, and Plaintiff does not survive the 21 years, . Plaintiff receives nothing […]' The judge at the Cuyahoga probate court dismissed William Lennon's case. However, in 2003, Lozick agreed to pay pay each of Fred Lennon’s . grandchildren, William included, $1.25 million. Each of his great . grandchildren (including any unborn) would receive $15,000. Catherine Lozick, or Cathey as she is also known, lives by her father's mantra. 'Secrecy is success. Success is secrecy.' She made the settlement with her nephew to avoid further litigation on his part, according to Forbes. However, . she needn't have bothered bending to her nephew's willl; that same . year, the trustees decided to hand over all the assets to Cathey Lozick . well ahead of schedule, making her an instant billionaire. Billion dollar digs? A satellite view shows the densely wooded Chagrin Falls, Ohio neighborhood that reclusive bilionaire heiress Lozick is believed to call home . Unassuming: The 68-year-old assumed billionaire won't go public with her rumored inheritance. Nor does she live in an ostentatious town. Pictured is Chagrin Falls, Ohio, where Lozick lives . Swagelock: The company that made the family its billions makes simple necessities like valves, piping, tubes, and other plumbing equipment. At right, the company headquarters in Solon, Ohio . Extended stay? The younger Lozick, Thomas (at right with wife Kay) works at Swagelock's Alabama location . Forbes experts estimate Cathey Lozick's fortune at $1.7 billion, but the billionaire has no interest in confirming or denying that figure. A Forbes reporter inquiring as to whether their estimate was accurate was given short shrift by a staffer at the Edward A. and Catherine L. Lozick Foundation, the charitable trust run by Lozick and her husband, who once worked for Fred Lennon. The reporter was told that Catherine Lennon was out of town and that even if she weren't, she wouldn't care to comment on her fortune.

Targets: UCL are aiming to reduce their proportion of students from private schools by 10 per cent in the next four years . Universities are unfairly favouring applicants from state schools, according to a private school leader. Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council (ICS), claimed it was ‘so wrong’ that institutions are asked to set targets on the numbers of state school and poorer youngsters they recruit. Many university modern language departments would ‘be forced to close’ if it were not for private school students, he insisted. A number of medicine, engineering, maths, classics and music departments also depend on these pupils. Mr Lenon said that many universities have ‘been persuaded’ by the Higher Education Statistics Agency to ‘target a reduction in the proportion of students coming from private schools’. University College London, for example, is aiming to decrease the proportion of students from private schools (currently 35 per cent) by ten per cent by 2017, he added. Writing in the Times Educational Supplement, he said: ‘One reason this is so wrong is that private schools now educate large numbers of bright students from lower-income backgrounds. ‘More than a third of our students are on reduced fees and many receive means-tested bursaries aimed at children from the lowest income homes. ‘When I started teaching 40 years ago, bursaries were unheard of and most scholarships went to children from wealthy homes. Today, much of that money has been diverted to means-tested bursaries.’ He added: ‘Another reason why the emphasis on independent/state school targets is so wrong is that it permits universities to claim they are doing their bit for social mobility when in fact they are simply taking more students from selective grammar schools and middle-class comprehensives. ‘The measure fails to identify the most disadvantaged children, in the most deprived areas, which is where the battle for improved social mobility really needs to be fought.’ 'Unfair': Chairman of Independent Schools Council Barnaby Lenon said university departments depend on private school students to keep running . The national A-level results for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, published on Thursday, showed that the proportion of A-level grades scoring an A* or A had fallen for the second year running as rising numbers of students opted for traditional subjects like science and maths. In total, 26.3 per cent of entries scored an A* or A , down from 26.6 per cent last year.","Chairman of Independent Schools Council said departments depend on private school students .

Police are investigating whether a wealthy banker whose plane crashed in the English Channel faked his own death. Sascha Schornstein, 36, has not been seen since his single-engine small aircraft came down off the coast of Kent. Investigators pulled a small amount of wreckage from the sea but have found no trace of the financier’s body. Sascha Schornstein, 36, pictured with his wife Yulia, 28, went missing when a plane he was flying crashed into the sea near the Kent coastline . They insist that the apparent tragedy remains a ‘missing person’s inquiry’ as they keep an ‘open mind’ over what took place. Officers have released a photograph of Mr Schornstein, a keen diver and sailor, in case he has been spotted since he boarded the plane. They declined to reveal the results of checks on his bank accounts, credit cards and mobile phones that could indicate if he is still alive. Yesterday, his wife Yulia, 28, appealed for up to £30,000 to help her solve the mystery of his disappearance. She said her German husband, who worked for the Royal Bank of Scotland, was a methodical and careful man and she cannot understand what happened. Fighting back tears, she revealed she wants to raise the money to pay for a submarine to find the missing wreckage after the official search was called off. She said: ‘I have to know what happened. I know Sascha was very responsible. ‘Flying was his passion and he was German and had that attention to detail so I’m sure that in that situation something unexpected must have happened. ‘I’m a little scared of flying but he always took me and I always felt comfortable and we went to France and Germany and he was always well prepared.’ Mrs Schornstein, who is originally from St Petersburg in Russia, added that she did not know why her husband would vanish. Mr Schornstein's wife Yulia has appealed for help with the search and said she could not think of a reason as to why her husband, a banker with the Royal Bank of Scotland, would go missing . She said: ‘We are very happy and money was not a problem. There are really no problems. He was very busy at work and he was working one night until 4am. ‘He often stayed late in the office and was working on something that was going to finish in July and we were going on holiday to France in August for my birthday.’ Mrs Schornstein has launched a website asking for donations to help fund her search. She believes an onboard recorded could help solve the mystery. Last night wellwishers had already given more than £3,000 towards her target. Mr Schornstein disappeared on July 21 as his Cirrus plane crashed about 15 miles off the coast of Dungeness, Kent. The banker, who lived in a £850,000 Knightsbridge apartment, worked for RBS in its commodity finance department. He had been living in London since 2001 and was a graduate of the London School of Economics. He had logged a flight plan before taking off from Blackbushe Airport in Hampshire on route to the coastal town of Le Touquet in France. An extensive search by the British and French authorities in water 50m deep led to the recovery of between 10 and 15 per cent of the aircraft. Yulia Schornstein said she and her husband were 'happy' and said 'money was not a problem' for the banker . There has been no sign of Sascha Schornstein or his emergency parachute since the crash on July 21 . Officials found parts of the wings, fuselage and doors but there is no sign of an emergency parachute or Mr Schornstein. The American-registered aircraft was rented by Mr Schornstein, who married his wife - who works in the hotel industry - 18 months ago. Sgt Andy Thomas, of Hampshire Police, said: ‘In the simplest terms because we have not found Sascha, this is a missing person inquiry. ‘Although it would appear he has been involved in an accident, we are keeping all lines of inquiry open.’ The officer said that at the moment there is nothing to suggest Mr Schornstein would have faked a crash and disappeared. He added that it was not unusual to find more of the wreckage and that the task of locating the main part of the plane had been very difficult. This map shows the intended flight path of the aircraft and the spot where it crashed in the Channel . Sgt Thomas said: ‘I’m keeping an open mind as to what has happened to Mr Schornstein. “We’re releasing a picture of him in case he has been spotted since, or if anyone else has important information that can assist us. ‘We are now conducting a missing person investigation and are working with international police as part of our inquiries.’ Officials from the Air Accident Investigation Branch are also examining what caused the aircraft to come down. The weather on the day was clear and fine. An RBS spokesman said: ‘I can confirm that an employee of RBS is currently presumed missing following a plane crash. ‘’We are working with the authorities to understand the current situation and we are in contact with his family to ensure they receive our full support at this difficult time.’","Sascha Schornstein, 36, has not been seen since crash on July 21 .

Bosses at the Serious Fraud Office secretly negotiated ‘irregular’ pay-offs for executives worth £1million by using personal email accounts to cover their tracks, the Daily Mail can reveal. The clandestine deals for senior civil servants were arranged by a handful of managers at the fraud-busting agency – in part through messages sent from private addresses – to prevent other staff from finding out. Sending emails from non-official accounts also made it far harder for them to be scrutinised by the public under the Freedom of Information Act, experts say. Details of the shocking attempt to cover up how public money was squandered by the fraud-busting agency comes after the BBC was accused of failing to keep proper records of excessive severance payments to senior managers, which MPs likened to ‘corporate fraud and cronyism’. The bumper payouts to the SFO’s former chief executive Phillippa Williamson and chief operating officer Christian Bailes were negotiated at the end of 2011 and approved by its then boss Richard Alderman without authorisation from his Whitehall supervisors. MPs later condemned him for showing a ‘disregard for the proper use of taxpayers’ money’ and described it as ‘a case study in how not to run a public body’. The Commons’ Public Accounts Committee also condemned the ‘astounding’ working conditions afforded staff at the body after it emerged that Mrs Williamson was allowed to run up huge travel bills commuting to London from her home near the Lake District. The PAC report said: ‘Mr Alderman’s decisions and actions were based on a culture where external advice and scrutiny was to be avoided wherever possible, and with an apparent need for secrecy.’ It criticised the SFO’s ‘poor quality record-keeping’. After agreeing the payouts, Mr Alderman sent a message to Mrs Williamson saying ‘please do not mention the severance agreement’ before an SFO audit meeting, the PAC was told. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s deeply worrying that discussions about the  spending of vast sums of taxpayers’ money were conducted in such a  clandestine manner. ‘The serious questions about the value of these payouts will only be compounded by the fact that these emails were exchanged through such informal channels. ‘Taxpayers deserve complete transparency when it comes to public bodies, and those responsible for these payouts must be clear as to exactly what happened and be held to account for their decisions.’ The SFO said last night that the agency’s new director had now issued strict rules banning the use of private emails for official work. A spokesman said: ‘The current director of the SFO is clear no private emails should be used to conduct SFO work and has issued guidance to that effect, in line with Government policy.’ The residential home of Phillippa Williamson, the now-former chief executive officer of the Serious Fraud Office in the village of Arkholme in Cumbria . Information held in private email accounts can be subject to Freedom of Information law if it relates to official business.But official guidance from the Information Commissioner says occasions when staff are requested to search personal email messages are ‘expected to be rare’. Maurice Frankel, of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, said: ‘Private emails are covered by the Freedom of Information Act but they are harder to get out. ‘It is more difficult for the Freedom of Information team in an organisation to say “We’re going to have a look for what’s there” if the information is on a private email account. It’s obviously very difficult for them to go to a senior person in their organisation and say to them, “We want to look at your private email”. ‘They are usually reliant on the individual admitting that there are some relevant emails and putting them forward.’ Echoes of the BBC scandal . He said that if staff in public bodies had to send emails from personal accounts because of difficulties logging on to official accounts while away from the office, they should always cc the emails they send into their work account.He added: ‘If they are not doing that there will be a question mark about why not.’ Education Secretary Michael Gove fought a long legal battle to try to avoid disclosing an email he sent to a civil servant and two special advisers through his wife’s email account. The Department for Education had a two-year dispute with the Information Commissioner that related to private emails before finally abandoning their opposition to making them public last year. The PAC found that Mr Alderman had agreed to payouts for three senior civil servants who were taking voluntary redundancy without the required approval being sought from the Cabinet Office or the Treasury. Mrs Williamson received £464,905 and Mr Bailes £437,167. The head of technology, Ian McCall, later received £49,885. 80 per cent oppose golden goodbyes . Mrs Williamson was also allowed to work from her Lancashire home and rack up travel and hotel bills of £98,946 for visiting the London office three days a week. She had previously worked at the Inland Revenue with Mr Alderman, who described her as an ‘exceptionally talented civil servant’. MPs on the PAC said Mr Alderman, 60, who retired as director of the SFO in April last year, days after Mrs Williamson left, had ‘failed to follow due process’ or ‘to comply with the rules that should underpin the use of public money’. Mr Alderman’s successor, David Green, found out about the unapproved payouts a month later only following a ‘chance comment by a junior member of staff’ and after making some further inquiries quickly arranged for an investigation, the committee heard. PAC chairman Margaret Hodge told Mr Alderman: ‘You had chats here and there. You decided the packages yourself. ‘You decided yourself that you did not need written agreement, you had had a natter with somebody on the phone. It is all indicative of a culture that you led.’ In a subsequent letter to the PAC, Mr Alderman issued a ‘deep and unreserved apology’ for the way he handled the exit agreements. Mrs Williamson and Mr Bailes both declined to comment yesterday. Mr Alderman could not be reached as he is on holiday.","Messages sent to personal accounts to keep deals off the radar .

A terrified basejumper hurtles towards the ground after his parachute failed to open when he jumped off a 1,000ft cliff. But amazingly Matthew Gough, 25, escaped with only minor cuts and bruises despite crashing into rocks on his way down before landing on the sand. The daredevil said he thought he was going to die when his parachute got twisted on his way down. Scroll down for video . Dazed, but alive: Matthew Gough, 25, filmed the jump over Lake Garda, in Italy, on a helmet camera . Leap of faith: Matthew, looking 1,000ft down, jumps over the edge of the cliff with the parachute strapped to his back . Matthew, of Lichfield, Staffordshire, filmed the jump at Lake Garda, Italy, using a camera attached to his helmet. He has carried out more than 180 basejumps at locations around the world and all of them had previously been successful. At the end of the video the daredevil can be seen lying on the ground appearing shocked but conscious and not seriously hurt. His parachute is only partially opened. He had minor injuries to his ankles and knees as well as a bloodied nose. Over he goes: Matthew had completed 180 base jumps successfully, as well as 700 sky dives, but this time the parachute failed to open properly and became twisted . Matthew was travelling the world and taking part in extreme sports but flew back to Britain after this jump went wrong. He was in hospital for around seven hours for tests but was swiftly discharged. Matthew, who took up the sport after completing over 700 sky dives, recalled the horrifying moment he thought he was going to die. He said: 'I prepared for the jump, everything felt really good. Then I performed a ""track"", which means you are flying in a forwards direction. Down: Just a moment later Matthew Gough crashed into the cliff as he tumbled down over Lake Garda, in Italy . 'Everything was going fine and then I pulled the parachute. The problem was the deployment was really slow, it comes down to simple bad luck, nothing else, the conditions were fine, the parachute twisted and when it inflated it was facing backwards. 'Due to the twists I couldn’t control it, I did the best I could with the situation and tried to avoid the cliff but I didn't have the time or the space to avoid the impact. 'When I impacted the first time I started spinning which made the situation worse, the parachute twisted even more before going into a dive and then spiralled towards the ground while I was smashing against the cliff. 'I was trying to think about what to do, but all I could think about was trying to stay alive, I knew the final impact was coming soon and I knew if I hit the floor at the speed I was travelling, I was in a whole lot of trouble. 'I managed to hang off one side of the canopy and get away from the cliff but couldn’t control it still, I didn’t know if I was going to hit the floor or go into the lake. 'I thought both of my legs were broken so I knew I couldn’t go into the lake, plus, I can’t swim which made things even worse.' He added: 'All I was shouting was ""give me something"" it was like I was in a gladiator arena faced against ten guys and I was given just a spoon to fight with, I felt I was desperately fighting to stay alive. 'I was trying everything I could to get some kind of control, then I looked down and saw around ten spikes which I believe were used to hang up wet suits. Drop: What Matthew could see as he went over the edge - but the ground quickly rushed towards him . Crash: Matthew hits the rocks several times on his way down to the bottom as the parachute failed to open properly. Amazingly, he suffered only minor injuries . Ground approaching: Michael said at this point he was convinced he was going to die - but remarkably he suffered only slight injuries . Helmet cam: Matthew, pictured before he went over the edge, used this camera to record footage of te terrifying jump . Crash! Matthew hits the ground but is conscious and talking. He was subsequently rushed to hospital for checks . 'At that point I thought I was going . to die so the last thing I shouted was ""I’m going in"" which means I’m . dead. I was trying to tell the guys at the top of the cliff what was . happening to me. 'The spikes . were around a foot long and there was ten of them, the one right in the . middle brushed my face and went between my helmet and my face and . ripped my helmet off, I think it cushioned my fall slightly. 'When . I hit the floor I was so shocked I was alive, I was thinking, I have . seen this stuff on videos but now it is happening to me, I was in total . shock that I was alive, that was when the pain set in.' Dazed: His parachute caught on a row of spikes, Matthew lies on the floor after his jump went wrong. He was injured, but not seriously . Cliff face: The cliff that Matthew Gough jumped from above Lake Garda - and ended up wounded on the ground . Precaution: Matthew is strapped up and wrapped in a blanket as he is put on a stretcher . Hospital: Matthew, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, is put in the back of the ambulance in Italy. He was detained for seven hours while checks were carried out, but was subsequently discharged . Treatment: Although he was put in a neck brace, Matthew Gough had suffered only minor cuts and bruises in the fall . Matthew suffered the fall on April 23 as he travelled the world taking part in extreme sports. He used to work in sales and marketing but saved up enough money to travel and indulge his adrenaline-pumping hobbies.Despite his fall, he insists he will still continue to base jump. He . said: 'I feel massively lucky to survive, I have never heard of this . sort of thing happening before and especially no one surviving from it. 'I . am still going to base jump but it has made me more aware of the risks, . I wouldn’t want this happening to me again and wouldn’t wish it one . anyone else. 'Some jumps I . may not do, I may avoid the more technical ones but I will carry on . jumping, my parents are desperate for me to stop, but I fully accept the . dangers of this sport and don’t expect any sympathy.'

An Iranian woman has been told she cannot have a seat on her city's council because she is too beautiful for the role. Nina Siahkali Moradi finished 14th out of 163 candidates in the Qazvin city council elections, polling an impressive 10,000 votes. But even though the result should have gained her a seat on the council, the 27-year-old candidate was disqualified with the council leader saying: 'We don't want catwalk models here.' According to the Independent, Ms Moradi had gained enough votes to become an 'alternative member of the council' - making her a first reserve. When one councillor gave up his seat, Ms Moradi should have been able to step in, but she was banned from doing so. She found out a week after the election on June 14 that any votes cast for her had been nullified. According to the International Campaign for human Rights in Iran, her disqualification was as a result of her 'non-observance of Islamic codes'. It has been suggested that her campaign posters prompted some of the council's conservative elders to complain. Opponents to her candidacy said that she had only been elected because because she is young and attractive. But on the posters she is wearing the required hijab and has only her face showing. She also passed a series of rigourous checks carried out prior to polling day carried out by a range of authorities including the police, intelligence ministry and the judiciary. The graduate student had campaigned under the slogan 'Young Ideas for a Young Future'. The Qazvin election took place on the same day as the country's presidential election.

Former football star Paul Gascoigne (pictured in April) has been arrested after an alleged drunken assault at a railway station . Former football star Paul Gascoigne has been arrested after an alleged drunken assault at a railway station. The 46-year-old ex-England and Newcastle player, who left rehab in the United States earlier this year, was held after an incident in Hertfordshire. A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'Police were called to a report of a man allegedly being drunk and disorderly at Stevenage railway station at 10.30pm on Thursday July 4. 'Officers attended the location and arrested a 46-year-old male on suspicion of common assault and being drunk and disorderly.' A British Transport Police spokesman said the arrested man had been bailed to return pending police inquiries. The Mirror reported that Gascoigne had grabbed a security guard by the throat before grabbing the arm of ex-wife Sheryl Gascoigne when she tried to step in. According to the newspaper, he was bailed after being held in a police cell for 12 hours overnight. A police spokesman told the newspaper there were two allegations of common assault, the first being against a station security guard. The spokesman said a 46-year-old man is alleged to have grabbed the security guard around the neck, while the second allegation concerned a member of the public who arrived during the incident. Paul Gascoigne celebrated his 46th birthday in May at Royal Windsor Racecourse, where his family surprised him by naming a race in his honour . Glamor couple: Former model Sheryl and Paul first met in the early 90s and became one of Britain's most famous couples. They married in 1996 but divorced a little over two years later . Help: Despite being separated, Sheryl has tried numerous times to try and help Gascoigne beat his alcohol problem (pictured together in 2008) He is one of the greatest footballing talents England has ever produced, but Paul Gascoigne's has become as famous for his off-the-field antics as anything he ever did as a player. During the Nineties his startling talent entertained millions, whether it was beating David Seaman from 30 yards in the FA Cup semi-final for Spurs or scoring his wonderful goal against Scotland at Euro 96 - chipping over Colin Hendry before volleying past the goalkeeper. But even then his behaviour made headlines, he celebrated the Scotland goal by re-enacting the infamous, drink-fuelled 'Dentist's Chair' antics of his 29th birthday. At the World Cup in 1990 he broke down in tears on the pitch when he picked up a booking which would have ruled him out of the final. He married long-term girlfriend Sheryl 1996. The glamorous pair were briefly the Posh and Becks of their generation, the superstar footballer and his model wife. But the romance was short-lived. The pair became embroiled in a high-profile divorce following allegations that Gascoigne had beaten her just two years later. His football career petered out as . alcoholism took over. Gascoigne first entered rehab in 1998 after reportedly drinking 32 shots of whisky in a session which left him 'rock bottom'. But he left after just two weeks of a recommended 28 day minimum stay. His first trip to the rehab centre in Cottonwood, Arizona, was in 2001 where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After several unsuccessful spells trying to play football again in the States and later as a player coach at Boston United, Gascoigne acknowledged his footballing career was finally over. Since then the trials and tribulations have only become ever-more bizarre. He has twice been sectioned under the Mental Health Act with one former lover claiming that he thought he was being chased by aliens. He narrowly escaped bankruptcy after claims he owed the taxman £200,000. In 2010, Gascoigne was said to have 'died' twice after being involved in a car crash with strangers in his home city of Newcastle. A month later, he  appeared at the scene of killer Raoul Moat's . final stand-off with police in the Northumberland town of Rothbury . bearing a fishing rod, a chicken, a Newcastle United shirt, a can of . lager and a dressing gown. Friends and commentators have said that Gascoigne has never really had the help he needs. But so many have tried and failed to get through. He said: 'The accusation is that he grabbed their arm.' Earlier . this year, Gascoigne said he wanted to 'get back to reality' after the . latest health scare in his battle with alcohol addiction. He . told ITV1's Daybreak in March: 'I didn't ask to be an alcoholic, but I . must admit I worked on it. I went to any lengths to get my drink, I'll . go even further to stay sober.' In . May, Gascoigne was pictured looking healthier than he had in years as he . celebrated his 46th birthday at the races with his family. Promises: Paul Gascoigne said on ITV1's Daybreak in March that he was prepared to go to 'any lengths' to stay sober . Former star: Gascoigne is still fondly remembered as one of England's greatest players (pictured celebrating his famous goal against Scotland in 1996) Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans (pictured) and former England cricketer Ronnie Irani organised Gascoigne's latest stint in rehab . He was pictured with daughter Bianca, her mother Sheryl and his son Regan at the Windsor Races at the Royal Windsor Racecourse. Gascoigne, who also played for Lazio and Tottenham Hotspur, went into rehab earlier this year after Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans and TalkSPORT presenter and former England cricketer Ronnie Irani organised it. After he left the rehabilitation centre in Phoenix, Arizona, he told ITV's Daybreak how he begged doctors not to let him die. He said he was rushed to hospital where medics did not think he was going to survive. And in April he thanked the celebrities and footballers, including Wayne Rooney, Jack Wilshere and Steven Gerrard, who helped to pay towards his stint in rehab. Hundreds of thousands of pounds were . raised within just days to meet the £7,500-a-week clinic fees. Gascoigne said afterwards a DVD . message from Sir Alex Ferguson had helped save his life during his five-week . stay. The 45-year-old said he watched the Manchester United manager and family and friends make emotional appeals for him to battle his demons. Gascoigne said: 'I was blown away watching people like Sir Alex telling me to stay strong and pull through. The move came following a charity . appearance in Northampton during which the star appeared unwell and . shaking, before breaking down and sobbing on stage in front of a room . full of fans. At the time he said that boredom was to blame for his latest setback in battling to overcome his addiction.

The call came in the early hours of October 27 – and Elaine Hanson remembers being ‘frozen in a place of absolute horror’. Only hours previously, she had been persuaded by nurses  to leave the bedside of her son – young author Luke Bitmead – to go home briefly for a change of clothes and a few hours’ rest. She had done so in the knowledge that Luke was on the mend after taking an overdose of painkillers  in what his mother describes as ‘a classic plea for help’. Elaine, 59, recalls the tragic night  in 2006: ‘All I could think of was that I had left my boy getting better. Physically, he was fit and strong. And now, just hours later I was being told he was dying.’ Tragic loss: Luke Bitmead giving his mother Elaine away at her wedding in 2005 . What happened to Elaine’s ‘vibrant and handsome’ son was undoubtedly heartbreaking – but also, arguably, avoidable. The 34-year-old, who had a history of depression, discharged himself in the middle of the night and walked out of the intensive care ward dressed in a pair of pyjamas. He took a taxi to a nearby multi-storey car park – and plunged 30ft, sustaining injuries that led to his death. Just last week, failures in NHS care of mental-health patients were again in the news after an apparent series of suicides at the Bradgate Mental Health Unit, a secure psychiatric hospital in Leicester. There have been ten such tragic incidents since 2010 at Bradgate, and inquests have highlighted repeated failings by staff. Across the UK,  there are on average 160 inpatient suicides a year. Following a BBC News investigation, the Care Quality Commission admitted that it has failed to properly inspect some units including Bradgate. Yet Luke was not even admitted to a secure unit – despite his first attempt at taking his own life. Mother-of-two Elaine, of Southrop, Gloucestershire, believes he should have been. ‘It was obvious he was in a fragile state of mind. It should have been clear to anyone – never mind a health professional – that Luke was far from well mentally. If the doctor who was looking after him had taken the time and read his notes, she would have seen that not only did the mental-health nurse who’d assessed him write that suicide was his ‘‘back-up plan’’, but that she was able to section him. ‘The psychiatrist who was looking after Luke had left instructions that Luke was to be sectioned for 24 hours if he tried to leave.’ Much loved: Luke surrounded by friends at his 23rd birthday . Hospital: Luke was admitted to the Great Western Hospital after taking an overdose of painkillers on October 24, 2006 . Being sectioned means a mentally ill patient being admitted to hospital whether or not they agree to it. The term refers to the use of a section from the 1983 Mental Health Act as the authority for the detention. This ‘section’ of the Act is used about 50,000 times a year in England and Wales.Such drastic action is taken when someone is so severely mentally ill that it is necessary to protect their own health or the safety of others. The process is typically started by  a family member and GP, and the decision is usually made by two doctors, one of whom must be an expert in mental health, and a social worker. The detention order can last up to  six months. Elaine and her husband, Chris Hanson, who was Luke’s stepfather, had to fight for five years before  the NHS Trust in charge of Great Western Hospital in Swindon, where Luke discharged himself on the night of his death, finally admitted that it made mistakes. 'It was obvious he was in a fragile . state of mind. It should have been clear to anyone - never mind a health . professional - that Luke was far from well mentally' - Luke's mother Elaine Hanson . The Trust has issued a formal apology, agreed an out-of-court settlement, and promised to change the way suicidal patients are treated. Elaine says: ‘Going over and over documents and continually reliving what happened really traumatised  me and my husband – and all because the NHS couldn’t put their hands up and say “sorry”. It’s despicable.’ Former model Elaine is now campaigning for a change in the law to ensure vulnerable people at risk of self-harm cannot discharge themselves from hospital. ‘In England, prisoners on suicide watch are kept safely under 24-hour-a-day supervision – why should it be different for everyone else?’ she asks. Luke, a former pupil at public school Radley College, had a degree in philosophy from Reading University and  his published novels include White Summer and Heading South. He had taken an overdose before, in 1998, but had not been hospitalised. He was admitted to the Great Western Hospital after taking an overdose of painkillers on October 24, 2006. Luke had gone to a hotel in Oxford that evening and taken a large number of tablets. ‘He rang me and said “I’ve been really foolish,” and my heart just sank,’ Elaine recalls. ‘He told me where he was and I told him to stay there and we’d come and get him.’ Family: Luke on holiday in Portugal with his mother and sister in 1975 . After being admitted to hospital, tests showed the overdose had damaged Luke’s liver and he was moved to intensive care. After three days, his condition improved and Elaine, who had kept a bedside vigil next to her son, went home to sleep. Hours later, she received a call from the hospital saying her son had discharged himself, followed by another shortly afterwards saying he had been readmitted – and was on a life-support machine. The fall at the car park had ruptured his aorta and severely damaged his internal organs, as well as causing multiple external injuries. Elaine had to make the heart-wrenching decision to have his life-support machine turned off. All those who knew and loved Luke were shocked at the news of his death. It took four years for an inquest into his death to be held. A verdict of suicide was recorded. Elaine says: ‘During the inquest, the doctor who discharged him said, “I now know I was wrong.” At the time of Luke’s death, I just couldn’t understand why she couldn’t have simply sectioned him for his own safety. I found this so hard to comprehend. I now know she hadn’t even read his notes.’ Elaine has also criticised the fact that her son was given only one hour with a mental-health nurse during his 60-hour hospital stay. Dr Joachim Stanley, a clinical negligence expert at Withy King Solicitors, says: ‘Luke’s untimely end was all the more tragic because it was avoidable. Sadly, cases like his are not uncommon.’ A spokesman for Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust says: ‘Since Luke’s death, as a Trust we have made significant improvements to the way we support and manage patients with mental-health needs in the hospital.’ Consultant clinical psychologist Dr Alison Brabban says: ‘Health professionals can sometimes feel so pressured that they avoid asking patients about suicidal thoughts even if they suspect they’re there, just in case they open up a topic they fear they won’t be able to deal with. Just last week, failures in NHS care of mental-health patients were again in the news after an apparent series of suicides at the Bradgate Mental Health Unit, in Leicester . ‘Not only do staff need training to spot signs of hopelessness, but they also need to feel confident that  they have the competences as well as the resources to help.’ Elaine’s call for new legislation  has been backed by mental-health charities. Paul Jenkins, CEO of one, Rethink Mental Illness, says: ‘Many health professionals can spot the signs of diabetes or a stroke, but cannot spot the basic signs that someone is suicidal. Training is not the only problem. Often staff are doing their best in a system that  is chronically underfunded, so even when they know someone needs specialist help, it isn’t easily available.’ Elaine adds: ‘When I sat with Luke’s body after the life-support had been switched off, I made a promise to my son that I’d fight with every breath I had to try to see that we achieved better treatment for people with mental-health problems. ‘I will grieve for ever, but I don’t want my grief to be energy that  just floats out into the ether. I want it to be used to create a possibility  of change.’","Luke Bitmead had history of depression but was able to discharge himself .

Not a single office in London's Shard has been filled, a year after the building was inaugurated, it has been revealed. While tourists and diners have flocked to the 360 degree viewing platform and sky-high restaurants at what is Europe's tallest building, big businesses have been somewhat less enthused. It is thought just 10 per cent of the skyscraper's 25-floors of office space have been let, with any firms not expected to move in until next year. The Shard has been a hit with tourists and diners, who have flocked to its viewing platforms and restaurants, but its 25 floors of office space remain empty a year after the building's inauguration . Unrivaled experience: Tourists have flocked to the Shard to experience the viewing platform and the building's three restaurants but it has struggled to attract businesses so far . Just 12 months ago London mayor . Boris Johnson confidently predicted the Shard would 'act as a huge . commercial magnet, creating vital new jobs and bringing in scores of . businesses'. There have been rumours a number of high-profile firms are on the brink of moving in, including financial advisers Duff & Phelps, Arabic TV channel Al-Jazeera and another Middle-Eastern company, South Hook Gas. But even if deals have been agreed, that would only mean about three of the floors being taken. Information on rents and prospective tenants is a closely-guarded secret, but it is thought the amount of prospective tenants pale in comparison to other new buildings in London, such as the Cheesegrater and Walkie-Talkie towers, which are 50 per cent let before construction has even finished. But Irvine Sellar, the developer behind the 72-storey structure, remains confident businesses will soon be moving in. Confident: Boris Johnson said the Shard would be a 'commercial magnet' when he openedlast year, left. Irvine Sellar, the building's developer, says that remains the case and expects firms to move in next year . Imposing: The Shard is the dominant feature in London's skyline and is Europe's tallest skyscraper, with 72 floors . He told The Times: 'We have signed up a few tenants and are in discussion with a number of others and we will make a decision when we are ready. We are taking our time, as we don't just want to fill the Shard up with accountants or lawyers.' Mr Sellar added the business plan for the building allowed for the first leases to be signed as late as 2014, and was in 'no hurry' to get firms on board before then. The cost of running a skyscraper is astronomical, with cleaning windows costing about £150,000 a year alone . Powering the building involves 'pre-booking' a block amount of electricity from the grid that has to be paid for even if it is not to be used. Office tenants also pay a service charge for items like cleaning and security, which one consultant said could come to as much as £9 million a year when the Shard is fully let. More than half a million tickets have been sold for the building's viewing platform . The consultant, who didn't want to be named, told the paper Mr Sellar is taking a 'determined stance' on who he would allow in the building and said it was 'bold' he hadn't held a launch specifically for the property market. But he backed him to succeed because demand for office space in London continues to grow. 'The prospects for the Shard look better than when it completed last year,' he said. Mr Sellar said more than half a million tickets had been sold for the viewing platforms and added: 'The Shard has been a long time coming. But this is a building that is going to last a few centuries.' The businessman is also developing the building next door, The Place, which, together with its imposing neighbour, make up what is known as the London Bridge Quarter.","Europe's tallest skyscraper struggling to attract businesses .

A couple who yearned to adopt a baby for years have finally realized their dream - with the help of Facebook. John and Kristen Juth, from Gahanna, Ohio, had many heartbreaking, failed attempts with fertility treatments and a surrogate when an adoption attorney made a surprise suggestion. Tommy Taneff, an adoption attorney in Columbus, told them to turn to social media as 'no one has a more vested interest than the couple in finding their baby'. Scroll down for video . Smiles all round: The couple adopted the baby girl Madison Ellen in June after finding their birth mother via Facebook . Facebook family: John and Kristen Juth, from Ohio, had many heartbreaking disappointments when it came to adoption until they turned to Facebook . The lawyer suggested that his clients post regular messages on their Facebook profiles making it clear they wanted to adopt or else set up a page dedicated to their potential adoptions. Far from just being a tool for sharing vacation photos or organizing a birthday bash, Facebook has taken on a vital role for people desperate to adopt. There is little data available to measure the rise in the phenomenon but Thomas Taneff, who runs a small firm in Columbus, Ohio, said that he has helped 75 couples or individuals adopt with help from the social network in the past three years alone. The National Adoption Foundation, which helps families across the U.S. with the adoption process, advocates using Facebook to set up a fundraising page. Last month, a http://www.tucsonnewsnow.com/story/23141584/adoption-over-facebook-adds-to-ohio-family put a couple's unborn Down Syndrome baby up for adoption on Facebook and received 900 responses from families wanting to raise the child within 24 hours. The flood of offers came from all over the U.S. and across the globe including from England, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands. The parents later interviewed three of those families with an adoption agency. He tells clients to regularly change their posts about adoption, using key search terms such as 'looking for a baby'; 'help us find a birth mother'; 'pregnant teenager'; and 'help us become a family'. Mr Taneff told MailOnline today that he encourages potential parents to post pictures regularly, giving an insight into their life - their home, pets, extended family and vacations. He then advises adding a link to a fuller profile about the couple or individual. He said: 'No adoption agency or lawyer, who can be looking after hundreds of people, will ever be as vested in finding a baby for a couple as the couple themselves. 'My advice is don't wait for the lawyers or agencies - network with your family, friends, co-workers. 'It is faster and its cheaper when you're proactive.' The story ended happily for the Juths, who told Tucson News, that on June 30 they adopted a baby girl called Madison Ellen. The child's birth mother had found the couple via their Facebook page. Mrs Juth said Madison 'is literally the love of our life'. Mr Taneff, who has around 100 adoption . cases at his practice, said that the Ruths had several leads within six . months of using Facebook. He . said that in general, the time taken for couples to adopt . has drop from two to three years to between six and 12 months with the help of social . media. The attorney . said that 75 of his clients have found babies by using Facebook to help with their . adoptions. Adorable! Madison Ellen was adopted by the Juths in June after they spent many years yearning for a baby . Maybe baby: Attorney Tommy Taneff advised his clients the Juths along with dozens of others to make use of social media . However, the lawyer explains, there are always some expected risks. Mr Taneff said: 'I tell prospective parents that . if someone approaches you and the first thing they say is ''money'', . then don't walk away - run. 'The same thing if someone claiming to be a birth mother approaches and says ''I . don't want to talk to your lawyer.''' Although Mr Taneff has seen a leap in . the number of initial introductions to adoptions being made on Facebook, . he then completes all the necessary assessments and paperwork to make . the adoption legal. MailOnline was awaiting a response from Facebook. Waiting and hoping: Kristen and John Juth said that the search for a baby took a huge emotional toll on them .","John and Kristen Juth, from Ohio, adopted a baby girl called Madison Ellen in June after many heartbreaking disappointments .

The New Mexico attorney general issued a scathing critique of the Albuquerque Police Department Friday over its finding that a high-profile civil rights attorney committed suicide, saying the death scene was 'terribly mishandled.' The mysterious death of Mary Han, 53, in November 2010 has been the source of controversy in New Mexico ever since Albuquerque police quickly ruled it a suicide. Han was a vocal adversary of the police department, and her family believes officers failed to look at other explanations for the feisty lawyer's death after she was found dead in the driver's seat of her BMW inside her garage. Scrutiny: More than two years after her body was found, the circumstances of Mary Han's death and the consequent police investigation are being questioned . In a press release and a letter Friday to the family's attorney, Attorney General Gary King said his review of the case found the evidence fails to definitively indicate she took her own life. He says the real cause of death may never be determined because of the 'puzzling police investigation.' He said his review found the scene 'was terribly mishandled due to inappropriate directions from high-ranking police and civilian administrators with the City of Albuquerque.' King says the official cause of death should be changed to 'undetermined', although he has no authority to order that. Only top officials in the medical examiner's office can make that decision. Albuquerque police and city officials did not immediately respond to calls and emails seeking comment. Police critic: Mary Han, a successful civil rights attorney who for decades battled for the rights of abused women, prostitutes and the homeless in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was an outspoken critic of the police department . The family's attorney, Rosario Vega Lynn, said Han's daughter and sister were thankful King's office took time to review the case. 'Attorney General King recognized that APD brass and high level city of Albuquerque officials meddled, no real investigation was done and Ms Han's death was unfairly and unjustly labeled as a suicide,' she said in an email. 'The actions of these individuals were inexcusable and the truth of what happened to Ms Han will be brought to light. The family will continue to fight until Ms. Han's good name is cleared.'King's findings echo some of the allegations made in a civil suit against the city, police department and a number of officials and officers by the family of Han. The civil suit details a series of alleged missteps that followed the discovery of her body, beginning with more than two dozen officers and city officials showing up to 'trample' through the house and death scene. An autopsy found the carbon monoxide level in Han's blood to be 84.8 per cent. But the lawsuit says it is improbable someone could get such a high concentration of carbon monoxide from ambient exposure.","The New Mexico Attorney General said the death scene of lawyer Mary Han was terribly mishandled .

About 60 overweight officers are taking part in the 12-day programme that will focus on changing their lifestyle. And the biggest loser at the end of the programme will win 5,000 Baht, approximately £110. Bootcamp: Thai police officers take part in a yoga program at a police training center in Bangkok . It includes dawn-t0-dusk exercise and lectures on healthy eating at a police training centre in Bangkok. The officers wear T-shirts with the slogan ‘Get rid of the belly’ and start their days with pre-dawn jogs, yoga, aerobic dance classes and lessons from nutritionists. They also do tai chi to reduce stress and improve the body’s blood flow. Weight in: The officer who loses the most weight at the end of the programme wins 5,000 Baht, almost £110 . The cash prize is considered a bonus for underpaid police officers though many say their real motivation is the chance to improve their health. Sgt. Maj. Wanchat Phonorthong, a 49-year-old traffic officer who at six feet tall weighs almost 21 stone, said: ‘The school children call me `Uncle Fat' all the time, but I don't mind.

Car salesman Gary Hawkins was sacked after his employer said he was too old at 52 . A car salesman was sacked after being told he was too old - at the age of 52. Gary Hawkins won a compensation payout for age discrimination after he took legal action against motor dealership giant Carcraft. The father-of-four had worked at the company for eight months when he lost his job. He told a Birmingham employment tribunal that a boss at the firm fired him after getting on a ‘high’ from sacking two other employees. Mr Hawkins claimed he was told by a regional manager at CC Automotive Group Ltd, which trades as Carcraft in Wednesbury, West Midlands, that he was told old for the job. The employment tribunal backed Mr Hawkins’ claim on Wednesday. Speaking today at his home in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, Mr Hawkins said: ‘I have struck a blow for middle-aged men and women everywhere. ‘I didn’t even know I wasn’t part of the youth culture until they got rid of me. ‘I believe I was the oldest guy working there and they had about 520 members of staff on all the sites. He added: ‘The judge said I was the oldest manager and probably one of the oldest staff members. ‘We had a new regional manager take over and he came in and told everybody on the first day if he had to sack everybody to improve the sales then he would.' He claimed he was sacked at 6pm on a Saturday shortly after two colleagues had been told they no longer had jobs, while another employee left because of how he was being treated. Mr Hawkins said: ‘It was a two minute conversation. He pulled me to one side and said: “I think you’re too old for my team, you’re sacked.” ‘He liked 20-year-olds he could bully, he didn’t like anybody with an opinion.’ Mr Hawkins has won thousands of pounds in compensation after being sacked by a regional manager . The company denied ageism and claimed Mr Hawkins had failed to motivate his team and had not trained them properly. But . he denied his work had been below par and stressed there were regular . team meetings where ways of improving sales were discussed. Mr Hawkins has now found a new job as a manager in the car sales industry . The tribunal heard other roles had been offered to Mr Hawkins but the firm admitted other members of staff had lost their jobs. Tribunal . judge Peter Rose QC also asked the ages of other managers, past and . present - and it emerged Mr Hawkins had been the oldest in his field. He has now found a new job as a manager in the car sales industry. Wife Heather, 48, said: ‘Gary’s definitely not over the hill. ‘He has three daughters and a son and they keep him on his toes. ‘Really, the whole thing has done him a good turn because he’s now got the best job in the world. ‘Out of all this stress, something good has happened - he now gets the time to see his children. ‘He’s at a place where they realise his ""softly, softly"" approach gets results. ‘It’s not nice having to live off credit-cards. The payout brings us back to where we were.’ Carcraft, which describes ‘the country’s leading used car supermarket’ with 11 showrooms nationwide, has declined to comment.","Gary Hawkins, 52, was told he was too old for his job at Carcraft .

Back in the day: During a covert career in which he infiltrated various groups, Bob Lambert has spoke of his disgust at some of his actions . A former Scotland Yard police officer who fathered a child with one of several targets he had relationships with while working undercover has apologised to the women. Bob Lambert said he would always regret the 'serious mistakes' he made during a covert career which saw him use the identities of dead children, give evidence in court under his false name and co-author a libellous leaflet. Mr Lambert used the alias Bob Robinson during his five years infiltrating environmentalist groups, when he was with the special demonstration squad (SDS), the Metropolitan Police unit that targeted political activists. The revelation that the married officer slept with four women - fathering a child with one - sparked outrage. In an interview with Channel 4 News, he said he accepts his behaviour was morally reprehensible and a gross invasion of privacy. 'With hindsight, I can only say that I genuinely regret my actions, and I apologise to the women affected,' he said. 'I'd always been a faithful husband. I only ever became an unfaithful husband when I became an undercover police officer.' The ex-officer declined to reveal whether his superiors were aware of the child - insisting he would only discuss that with an investigation into the activities of undercover police activities being led by the chief constable of Derbyshire. Mr Lambert said he 'didn't really give pause for thought on the ethical considerations' of adopting the identity of a dead child in 1984 as it was standard practice at the time. 'That's what was done. Let's be under no illusions about the extent to which that was an accepted practice that was well known at the highest levels of the Home Office,' he told the programme. He confirmed that he had appeared in court as Bob Robinson but could not say whether the judiciary was made aware by the police that he was doing so. 'On occasions I was arrested as Bob Robinson and to maintain cover I went through the process of arrest, detention, and on occasions, appearing in court,' he said. He denied it amounted to perjury as 'the position was that I was maintaining cover as Bob Robinson'.But asked if the court was 'made aware', he added: 'Well, that's what needs to be established.' Mr Lambert also confirmed that he helped write a libellous leaflet that attacked fast food giant McDonald's and triggered the longest civil trial in English history. McDonald's famously sued two green campaigners over the leaflet in a landmark three-year high court case. It was not disclosed during the costly civil legal proceedings brought by McDonalds in the 1990s that an undercover police officer helped write the leaflet. 'I was certainly a contributing author to the McLibel leaflet. Well, I think, the one that I remember, the one that I remember making a contribution to, was called What's Wrong With McDonalds?', he told Channel 4. Over the line: Bob Lambert in a more recent picture, fathered a child with one of his targets . Asked if that fact was disclosed during the proceedings, he said: 'I don't know.' He repeated his rejection though of claims that he planted an incendiary device in a Debenhams store in Harrow in 1987, calling that a 'false allegation'. Mr Lambert, who was an SDS manager for five years, earlier this week insisted he had not been aware of any campaign against the family of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence. Those claims were made by another veteran of the unit, Peter Francis, who alleges he was told to find information to use to smear the Lawrence family - who are calling for a public inquiry to examine the issue. Home Secretary Theresa May has said they would be looked at by the Derbyshire probe and a separate inquiry led by barrister Mark Ellison QC into alleged corruption in the original Lawrence murder investigation, but has left open the possibility of other action. 'My reputation is never going to be redeemed for many people, and I don't think it should be,' Mr Lambert said. 'I think I made serious mistakes that I should regret, and I always will do. I think the only real comfort I can take from my police career is that the Muslim Contact Unit was about learning from mistakes.' Belinda Harvey, one of eight women who are suing the Metropolitan Police over relationships with men who turned out to be undercover officers, rejected his apology. 'Almost everything he said to me was a lie; why would I possibly believe what he says to me know.' she told Channel 4. 'If it hadn't been for the case we're bringing against the police, he would never have apologised and I would have lived the rest of my days not finding out the truth.' Former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald of River Glaven said the latest evidence strengthened the case for a judge-led public inquiry. 'It is as bad as I think we thought it was,' he said. 'He seems to have admitted a great deal of the conduct that people feared had been taking place. 'It now sounds as though not only senior police officers but senior civil servants may have known what was going on. 'It's no good having this multitude of inquiries that are going on at the moment, one of them conducted by the police themselves which is pretty hopeless in my view. 'We need a single public inquiry under a senior judicial figure to examine what happened, what went wrong, who authorised it and most of all to reassure us that its not going on still.'","Bob Lambert had a five-year covert career using the alias Bob Robinson .

Their exclusive interview with GQ magazine is their most revealing to date, but One Direction's devoted fans aren't too happy with how their idols have been portrayed. Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne and Niall Horan were unveiled as the latest cover stars for the publication this week, with topics discussed in the accompanying interview including bisexual rumours, groupies and their tangled love lives. And since the publication of the interview, the magazine has experienced a major backlash from dedicated Directioners, who bombarded the GQ Twitter account with a string of often foul-mouthed and abusive messages. Scroll down for videos . Not so lucky: GQ's Twitter account was subjected to a barrage of abuse thanks to its One Direction cover . Messages from fans range from . the funny to the terrifying with many specifically complaining about the . way that Harry was portrayed. Alongside Harry's individual GQ cover was the tagline 'He's up all night to get lucky', with many fans complaining it was an unfair way to describe the 19-year-old singer. Pointing out Harry's clean-cut side, . one Twitter user wrote: 'Harry isn't ""Up all night to get lucky"" he's up . all night making Vines, hanging out with hair stylists, old people, and . a baby'. 'We're not dating': Harry has admitted that he is 'just friends' with Nick Grimshaw, despite being plagued by rumours that they are a couple . Other Directioners weren't quite so . polite though with another posting an explicit reply to Harry's own . tweet which promoted the interview: 'IM F*****G P****D AT HOW THEY PORTRAYED YOU, YOU ARE NOT A GOD DAMN MAN W***E, YOU ARE A CUPCAKE. JESUS.' Another pointed out that the boy's . fans are notoriously loyal, tweeting: 'I'll f**k you up GQ, I swear . you've messed with the wrong people'. The GQ interview saw Harry open up . about rumours he's bisexual, with the teen star addressing the . speculation that he and Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw are more than just . friends. Reassuring his legions . of female admirers, Harry insisted he 'didn't know' about the rumours, . adding: 'We’re not dating, no. We’re just friends.' When asked whether or not he's bisexual, Harry said: 'Bisexual? Me? I don’t think so. I’m pretty sure I’m not.' But the star seemed magnanimous about . the circulating stories, saying: 'Some of them are funny. Some of them . are ridiculous. Some of them are annoying. 'I don’t want to be one of those . people that complains about the rumours. I never like it when a . celebrity goes on Twitter and says, “This isn’t true!” It is what it is; . I tend not to do that.' But . while Harry is single, some of the boys are in relationships, and have . admitted that being faithful is easy as they don't have time for . groupies. 'Groupies? We don’t have time to party! I’m not even single. This sort of talk will get me in trouble,' said Liam Payne. World takeover: Zayn Malik also covers one of the editions, as the boys release new single Best Song Ever . Even fan favourite Niall Horan, who . recently dated Zoe Whelan, said: 'We go back on the road straight after a . show and we’re gone. I wish we did have time for girls and parties but . we don’t.' But it seems that . a certain British singer has caught his eye, adding: 'I’ll say one . thing: Ellie Goulding – wow. She’s absolutely amazing looking.'

The billionaire Google chairman has been hunting for a new luxury London home that would leave him with a higher UK tax bill than the internet giant has paid out on average in recent years. Eric Schmidt has hired a friend of Prince William to help him search for a new mansion in the sought-after neighbourhoods of Chelsea or Holland Park. Due to the spiralling cost of homes in the prestigious postcodes it is estimated that stamp duty would cost him £2.1million, less than the average yearly amount paid by Google in corporation tax between 2006 and 2011. House hunting: Google chairman Eric Schmidt has been searching for a new London mansion . According to regulatory findings, over that period Google generated £12billion in UK revenues and paid just £10.6million in corporation tax, leading to the company facing heavy criticism for its tax policies, including from Labour leader Ed Miliband and MP Margaret Hodge, who labelled the company's tax ploys as ""brazen"". Last year, Google paid £7.3million in corporation tax on sales of £3billion, although tax experts have claimed the figure should have been at least £200million higher. Mr Schmidt, said to be searching for a family-sized home, has been viewing properties valued at around £30million, according to newspaper the Financial Times. He is said to have hired Thomas Van Straubenzee, a friend of Prince William and a partner in estate agent firm VanHan. Mr Van Staubenzee is believed to be on his honeymoon, following his lavish wedding to Lady Melissa Percy, the daughter of the Duke of Northumberland in a ceremony attended by a host of Royals including William and Harry, and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

Pippa Middleton and Harry's rumoured new . girlfriend Cressida Bonas were also present, while the Prince's ex . Chelsea Davy was a bridesmaid. Mr Van Straubenzee was unavailable for comment, while a Google spokesman declined to issue a statement on the claims. Due to the Government increasing stamp duty on homes worth more than £2m to seven per cent this would mean that a £2.1m fee would be owed on a £30m home. One estate agent with awareness of the house hunt said that Mr Schmidt's only criteria for his new home is that it ""doesn't require any work.""

Patrick Loughrey recieved a £866,000 payoff from the BBC before moving into another public-sector job . A former executive  who left the BBC with an £866,000 settlement has found another highly paid public sector job. Patrick Loughrey, 57, was given 12 months’ salary ‘in lieu of notice’ even though the former ‘nations and regions’ boss had agreed his exit 14 months earlier and worked out his notice period. The payment – which the Government spending watchdog said was ‘inconsistent’ with  Corporation policy – included a £266,288 ‘pension augmentation’ as part of his ‘early retirement’. Mr Loughrey, who in April 2010 started a £200,000-a-year job as the taxpayer-funded Warden of Goldsmiths University, joined the BBC in 1984 as an education producer and left in 2009. He told the Daily Mail any  severance payments were ‘made in fulfilment of long standing entitlements’ and ‘approved at the highest level’. On Monday, a National Audit Office report sparked a furious row as years of BBC pay-offs were revealed. In all, it handed staff £369million over eight years, the watchdog said. MPs said the massive sum showed an ‘outrageous disregard for licence fee payers’ money’. The National Audit Office said the BBC often breached its own guidelines and had ‘put public trust at risk’ by authorising the payouts, including £61million to senior managers. Mr Loughrey said that he was unable to discuss his payment. In a carefully worded statement this week, he said: ‘As you will be aware from yesterday’s National Audit Office report, certain staff names were anonymised by the BBC to comply with data protection law. Loughrey took up a £200,000 a year job as warden at Goldsmith's University . ‘You will also know from the Report that there are clauses in their employment contracts which prohibit those individuals from disclosing details about their severance payments. ‘Given this, I consider I am unable to respond to the specific questions you have raised. ‘I would however like to make clear that any severance payments I received . . . were made in fulfilment of long-standing contractual entitlements and approved at the highest level.’ The former teacher took early retirement from his role as director of nations and regions in December 2009. Loughrey's generous pay deal reportedly came after discussions with then director general, Mark Thompson . He had responsibility for BBC Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and English Regions and led 6,500 staff, with a £300,000 salary, an expense account and pension contributions. Mr Loughrey was referred to by the National Audit Office as ‘Case Study 1’. It said his generous pay deal came after discussions with then director general, Mark Thompson, and deputy director general, Mark Byford. It added the BBC ‘offered to work closely with the manager with early planning for moving to a career outside the BBC’. He secured a year’s pay for redundancy, as well as a year’s pay ‘in lieu of notice’. The report observed: ‘This case provides an example of a departing senior manager receiving their maximum pay in lieu of notice (£300,000) despite the fact that they worked their notice.’ The NAO report showed Mr Loughrey had found ‘alternative employment’ before leaving. The report said the executive’s final salary was £300,000. The BBC’s website archive also shows that Mr Loughrey was paid £300,000 when he left. Irish-born Mr Loughrey, who lives in Kew, south-west London, is now paid £206,000 a year by Goldsmiths University. He did not deny the suggestion that he was the recipient of the £866,000 deal, but stuck to his carefully worded statement.","Patrick Loughrey was given £866,000 when he left his role at the BBC .

Several people in Indiana got a treat when they looked towards the skies on the 4th of July, but it wasn't fireworks they were seeing. Residents of Fort Wayne captured photographs of a rare weather phenomenon commonly referred to as a fire rainbow. Formed by the perfect alignment of sunlight passing through cloud particles, a fire rainbow looks like a horizontal rainbow colored streak scorched across the sky. Scroll down for video. Indiana locals were treated to a fire rainbow (pictured here), a rare weather phenomenon, in the sky on the 4th of July . The Indianan's sent in photographs of the phenomena to local News Channel 15, wane.com. The station's excited meteorologist Nicholas Ferreri said that he was pleasantly surprised to see the fire rainbow photos when he came into work. 'This is definitely not something that happens every day,' he told the station's website. Fire rainbows occur when sunlight and cloud ice particles align perfectly to create a prism that hangs beneath the sun and looks like a rainbow in the shape of flames . Not actually made of fire or a real rainbow, a fire rainbow or circumhorizontal arc appears when sunlight passes through the ice crystals in cirrus clouds, according to the UC Santa Barbara Department of Geography. When the light and cloud particles are perfectly aligned, the crystals act as a prism and refract the light in what commonly looks like a rainbow. 'The complete halo is a huge and beautiful multicolored band running parallel to the horizon with its center beneath the sun,' the academic institution explains. News Channel 15 meteorologist Nicholas Ferreri explains what a fire rainbow is, while viewer images are displayed behind him . Ferreri admitted that after receiving the images he had to consult with the National Weather Service to confirm what the prism was. 'At first, we thought it was what's known as a 'sun dog', but it didn't seem to match all the characteristics,'  Ferreri said. 'After some digging on both of our ends, one of my meteorologist colleagues, Sam Lashley, at the Northern Indiana National Weather Service Forecast Office was the one who  matched it with the characteristics of the rarely occurring 'Fire Rainbow.'' A fire rainbow is not actually fire or a rainbow, and the scientific name for the weather occurrence is actually a circumhorizon arc . A sundog is a halo at the same elevation as the sun, which looks like a bright colored spot in the daytime sky, according to The American Meteorological Society. He noted that the horizontal pattern of the heavenly occurrence was what helped him and his fellow meteorologists confirm the circumhorizonal arc citing. 'What a neat sight!  A 'Fire Rainbow' on the 4th of July,' Ferreri commented on the station's website. Watch video here: .

Marr, 53, was rushed to hospital after being taken unwell seven months ago. Doctors warned his wife, journalist Jackie Ashley, he might not survive the bleeding in his brain and that if he lived he could be left unable to move, see, speak or hear. Following months of rehabilitation, he is now preparing to return to broadcasting full-time next month. But speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, he said he was still unable to perform some basic tasks. He said: ‘I can't type because my left arm is still no good. I used to touch-type but I can't any more. I used to think I could only think through my fingers.’ Comeback: Marr is due to return to hosting his Sunday morning political show next month . Physio: The serious stroke in January damaged Marr's left arm and leg, and means he has to walk with a stick . He said a revised version of his 1992 book The Battle For Scotland had been updated using a dictation machine. Marr, the corporation's former political editor, began his career as a newspaper reporter, becoming the editor of The Independent before turning to television. He has also presented a number of history programmes along with his politics show and has had five books published. He has previously blamed a combination of overwork and excessive exercise for his stroke. ‘I had a major stroke, I'm frankly lucky to be alive. I had been heavily overworking - mostly my own fault - in the year before that,’ he said in April. He is due to return to full-time presenting this autumn, taking up the helm again on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show from September 1 and is also returning to Radio 4's Start The Week. Grilling: Marr has been off TV screens since being taken ill in January, but did record an interview with Prime Minister David Cameron in June . Marr worked to update his book on Scottish politics ahead of next year's referendum on independence. He predicted it would be '""much closer than the polls suggest' and there was still a 'lot to play for'. But he admitted there was a 'very strong anti-English feeling' in Scotland, adding: 'I don't think it is particularly serious most of the time, but it can become serious, it can become toxic.' He hailed Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond as 'some kind of political genius' but after being in power for some time is now 'struggling with the gilt rubbing off a little bit'. The Glasgow-born journalist also revealed he would choose a Scottish passport should Scotland vote yes next year.

Senior Tory MP David Davis condemned Mr Clegg’s officials for citing ‘personal reasons’ to prevent the release of emails relating to a £12 million Government grant allocated to Booktrust last year. The money was awarded after lobbying by one of Mr Clegg’s aides, who drew attention to the fact that Miriam Clegg had hosted a lavish function for the charity. 'Cover-up': Nick Clegg has been accused of fast-tracking a grant to a charity linked to his wife Miriam . The representations by Matt Sanders led to the grant being awarded directly, without the need for Booktrust to compete with other charities. Criticism: David Davis has called for greater transparency from the Deputy Prime Minister . A freedom of information request for emails sent by officials about the deal was blocked by the Cabinet Office, which claimed that publication would ‘prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs’. The Mail on Sunday appealed to Information Commissioner Christopher Graham. Last week, after forcing the Cabinet Office to give him the correspondence, Mr Graham said he had asked officials to ‘clarify a number of points’ before he decides whether to order a release. Cabinet Office officials then contacted The Mail on Sunday to say they were now arguing that publication should be withheld because the emails contained ‘personal data’.

Commons Speaker John Bercow is ‘pushing hard’ to recall MPs from their summer holidays if Nelson Mandela dies this August - at a cost to taxpayers of more than £40,000. MPs, officials and government sources say Mr Bercow is ‘bursting’ to recall Parliament to pay tribute to the former ANC leader. But his enthusiasm for a recall - which would be unprecedented for a foreign leader - has irritated some MPs. Bursting: Speaker John Bercow is said to be 'pushing hard' for a recall of Parliament if Nelson Mandela should die while it is in recess. The move is said to have irritated some MPs . They believe Mr Bercow is seeking ‘penitence’ for his membership, in the 1980s, of the ultra-right wing Conservative Monday Club and the Federation of Conservative students which both disparaged Mr Mandela’s fight for freedom. The Speaker has denied claims that he once wore a t-shirt emblazoned with the slogan ‘Hang Nelson Mandela’ but the shirts, and stickers, were manufactured when he was a member of the FCS, which was shut down by Tory high command in 1986 when he was chairman. Mr Bercow was also secretary of the Monday club’s Repatriation Committee, which called for immigrants to be sent back to their country of origin. Derek Laud said in 2011 that the Monday Club, of whom Bercow was a member, said Mandela was a 'criminal' who 'deserved' his sentence . Black Tory Derek Laud, who was a member of both the FCS and the Monday Club told the Mail in 2011: ‘According to the Monday Club, Nelson Mandela was a “criminal” and “deserved” his prison sentence. I was alone in saying the opposite and John and his cohorts told me I only felt such a thing because I was black. He was robustly in support of the apartheid regime in South Africa.’ But since the 1980s the Speaker has been on a political journey that saw him elected almost entirely by Labour MPs in 2010 and has seen him embrace a series of fashionable left-wing causes. A senior Tory MP told the Mail: ‘Bercow is pushing hard for Parliament to be recalled if Nelson Mandela passes away during the summer recess, even though there’s no precedent for a foreign leader to be honoured in this way. ‘Many MPs think he’s pushing so hard as an act of penitence for his previous involvement in the Monday Club and allegedly wearing a “Hang Nelson Mandela” t-shirt. ‘There’s a mixed view in Parliament. Some people think Mandela deserves to be recognised and others feel it would be wrong since we haven’t done it in the past for people like the Pope or Mother Theresa. Recalls cost a lot of money too.’ The recall of Parliament in August 2011 after the riots in London and other cities cost taxpayers nearly £44,000 - but that doesn’t include the travel allowances paid to MPs in order to get home for the debate. A briefing note compiled by the House of Commons Library shows that not one of the 26 Parliamentary recalls since 1948 has concerned the death of a foreign leader. Most have concerned wars, international crises and terrorist attacks. The decision over whether Parliament is recalled ultimately resides with the Speaker, but he is only supposed to act after a request from ministers. Senior government sources say David Cameron and his ministers would not want to be seen standing in the way of a session to pay tribute to Mr Mandela. David Cameron and other colleagues are said be surprised by the degree to which Mr Bercow and his staff have pushed the issue in discussions with government whips and officials . But officials say they have been surprised by the degree to which Mr Bercow and his staff have pushed the issue in discussions with government whips and officials in Whitehall. ‘It is clear that Bercow is determined to recall Parliament. He’s bursting to do it,’ one source familiar with the discussions said. By contrast, Mr Bercow was reported to be irritated by David Cameron’s determination to recall Parliament after the death of Lady Thatcher On that occasion, his wife Sally, a Labour supporter, refused to attend the funeral saying she did not want to join in the ‘attempted canonisation’ of the late prime minister.

David Cameron faced a damaging Cabinet revolt last night over his plans to go ahead with the £42 billion High Speed 2 rail link. Well-placed sources claimed that Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has vowed to kill off the project on the grounds that it will damage the environment. The Prime Minister has made the vastly ambitious scheme, linking London and the North with 225mph trains, a symbol of his commitment to investing in the nation’s future. Elaborate plans: Fears over damage to the environment and mounting costs is creating growing opposition to HS2 . But in recent weeks, the plan has come under increasing criticism, with even former Labour Business Secretary Peter Mandelson warning that it could be an ‘expensive mistake’. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Mr Paterson and one other Tory Cabinet Minister have expressed doubts about the plan. A well-placed Tory insider said: ‘Owen’s view is that he will subject it to such tough environmental tests that he will kill off the whole thing. ‘He does not like HS2.’ Threat: The Cheshire countryside where the proposed HS2 link between London and Manchester may run . The huge project is expected to destroy 135 acres of ancient woodland – sparking promises from Ministers last week that soil from the woods would be transplanted to new sites. But a second Tory Cabinet Minister has privately sounded the alarm over the enormous bill, which has already risen by nearly £10 billion since original estimates. The Minister told friends last week: ‘When we’re trying to cut public spending and make ends meet, HS2 doesn’t add up. If we are going to spend billions of pounds on rail infrastructure, surely it should be on improving existing lines.’ Tension: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, right, has reportedly vowed to kill off the project which David Cameron has made a symbol of his investment in Britain's future . The Cabinet doubts about the project, which will slice through Tory heartlands, emerged as Labour support for it began to crumble. Lord Mandelson claimed last week that the previous Labour government’s plans for the line had been based on flawed estimates and said all political parties ‘should think twice before binding themselves irrevocably to HS2’. Last weekend, Alistair Darling, the former Chancellor, revealed  he was now an ‘HS2 sceptic’.But Mr Paterson’s office denied last night that he had ever vowed  to kill off the project. Sources close to the Environment Secretary confirmed he was ‘not a fan’ of HS2 but said he had merely promised MPs in the constituencies affected that proper environmental tests would be applied.","The huge project is expected to destroy 135 acres of ancient woodland .

Neighbours of Abu Qatada have threatened to stop paying council tax if his family is not removed from the area. Qatada was this morning due to be flown to Jordan in a private jet commissioned by the Home Office from RAF Northolt after a ten-year battle costing taxpayers £2 million. But it is believed that his wife, two sons and two daughters will remain living in the UK. Now residents in Stanmore, North-West London, where the family live, want them removed, saying they are ‘fed up’. They have signed a petition threatening to refuse to pay council unless the family is evicted. One neighbour in her 40s, who does not want to be identified, said that she and dozens of others have signed the petition, which they have submitted to Harrow Council. Harrow Council has not yet responded. The family of Qatada,  53, moved into a four-bedroom detached house on the street about six months ago. They are all believed to be living on benefits. Qatada was living there too until March when he was re-arrested for breaching his strict bail conditions. He has been in custody at maximum security Belmarsh prison in South-East London since then. Another neighbour said: ‘Why should they stay here on benefits while we pay taxes. 'People like that should not have been allowed to live in this country.’ She added that residents were afraid of having such a dangerous terrorist’s family living in their midst.

No one expects to park their car free of charge next to the airport terminal building while they fly abroad on holiday. But then neither do they expect to be charged simply for dropping off or picking up friends and family at the airport — let alone fined if they take too long. Yet that is exactly what Luton and many other British airports now do. Since Birmingham Airport first introduced drop-off charges in 2007, they have been quietly — some would say sneakily — introduced by nine other regional airports. Entry barrier ticket machines, coupled with high-tech number-plate recognition cameras, monitor your arrival and departure. Drive up to Luton’s drop-off point and you will be charged £2. Leave your car unattended while you help your passengers find their way to the right check-in desk, or exceed the maximum 15 minutes waiting time, and you will be hit with an £80 penalty. Sky-high: The car park at Heathrow, where it costs £163.90 to park your car for eight days . Snowed under: Car parking rates may put many holidaymakers off using a particular airport (Luton pictured) And the same applies if you stop, even for a few seconds, on any of the airport’s approach roads.This week, councils have been widely condemned for the excessive charges they impose on motorists for on-street parking. Between them, they made profits of £565 million in parking charges and fines. In fact, it is illegal for councils to use parking as a source of revenue. But when it comes to predatory airport parking companies, there is no legislation to protect motorists from extreme charges. Airports can charge whatever they like. Alongside the excessive drop-off charges and ‘fines’ for anyone who, unfamiliar with the road layouts, stops momentarily to read a sign, or adjust a rear-view mirror, airports have jacked up their long-term parking charges. It now costs £163.90 to park a car at Heathrow for eight days and £302.50 for 15 days. Southampton charges £171 for two weeks’ parking and Bournemouth £160. And, unlike Heathrow, where you can still drop off someone for nothing, Bournemouth Airport charges £2.50 just to stop briefly and let out a passenger. Airports try to distance themselves from blame by saying parking and traffic management are contracted out to specialist firms. What’s more, many of these firms are foreign-owned. Ridiculous: A parked plane gets a better deal than a parked car these days at airports . Money-maker: Cars parked at Gatwick airport car park . For example, overstay at Luton and you will receive a ‘parking charge notice’ from a German-based company called Apcoa, which also manages car parking at Heathrow, Gatwick, Southampton, Exeter and Aberdeen airports, and runs the traffic management at Birmingham Airport. Stansted and Edinburgh airports contract out parking to a Spanish company called Empark. Both firms collect money from motorists via what they call ‘Parking Charge Notices’ — named, presumably, to ape official, police-issued ‘Penalty Charge Notices’. These dress the fees up as fines, but they are not legally fines. In truth, parking on private land is governed by contract law, and in order to collect the money, the parking company would have to take out a civil action in court. Some motorists have rumbled this and refuse to pay, resulting in some parking companies dropping the charge — presumably for fear that the courts would rule that their parking charges represent an unfair contract. But most motorists simply pay up. In for a penny in for a pound: Airport car parking is very much seen as a rip-off and now has to be factored in when working out holiday costs . I approached several airports to ask how much revenue they generated from parking. Most refused to say, citing ‘commercial sensitivity’. But Manchester Airports Group, the largest UK-owned airports operator in the country, said that in the year to March 2013 it earned £59  million from parking fees at Manchester, East Midlands and Bournemouth airports. That is 14.3  per cent of total revenues, and £7  million more than it earned from parking the year before. Despite claims that increased charges are designed to encourage use of public transport and to reduce traffic congestion, squeezing cash from motorists is a lucrative source of income. In many cases, airports must be extracting more money from passengers parking their cars than from them as air passengers. EasyJet, for example, is advertising flights from Gatwick to Milan or Sardinia for £52 return. But parking your car in the long-term car park for a week at Gatwick will cost exactly twice this: £104. At some airports it now costs more to park a car than a plane. Manchester, which charges £35 per day in its short-term car park, charges only £21 for a six-seater light aircraft to be parked on the runway apron for the same period. Even an Airbus A380 gets four hours’ free parking on the apron at Manchester. Not so motorists, who must pay £2.80 to park their car for a mere half an hour. Luke Bosdet, of the AA, says: ‘Where airports see a motorist, they see a pound sign. ‘It is not unreasonable to want to move passengers along quickly and so to cut congestion, but airports could do that by employing marshals to move motorists along, not by penalising them with high charges.’ He adds that concessions should also be made for cars dropping off disabled people.Some airports have even used the threat of terrorism as an  excuse for charging drivers who drop off passengers. A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport, which charges £1 to enter its drop-off zone, said the area had to be redesigned after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport in 2007. But Bournemouth Airport, which charges £2.50 for cars that drop off a passenger, admits that ‘the prime rationale for the charge is commercial’ and has been driven by the fact that passenger numbers have fallen during the recession. Crazy money: Parking a car for a fortnight is more expensive than parking up a plane . When Stansted Airport introduced a £2 charge for vehicles to enter its drop-off zone last year, its then owners, the Spanish group Ferrovial, claimed the charge was part of an ‘environmentally friendly’ travel plan to encourage the use of public transport. But if it is so concerned about  its carbon emissions, why doesn’t it end its short-haul routes and tell passengers to take the train instead? A spokesman for the airport’s new owners, Manchester Airports Group, admitted that ‘car parking is used to keep charges low for airlines, resulting in cheaper air fares for our passengers’. What he really means is that the airport has lost business from budget airlines, which have been shopping around for cheaper landing fees elsewhere, and that the airport is reduced to trying to cream a profit from motorists instead. It is impossible to know how many passengers, stung by Stansted’s £2 drop-off charge, have vowed never to go back to the airport. But figures show that while there were 24 million passengers in 2007, last year the number had dropped to 17.5  million. A spokesman for the airport says that its parking charges are now ‘under review’. If the airports want us to carrying on travelling, and spending money in their shops, perhaps they could start by removing the threats and excessive charges they are using to fleece us when we dare to travel to the airport by car. In other words, stop acting as pirates and concentrate on returning air travel to what it once was: a pleasure, not an experience which leaves us fuming before our plane has even taken off.","Drop-off point at Luton Airport will cost you £2 .

A father has spoken of his shock at learning that body parts belonging to his murdered son have been discovered in a hospital laboratory 17 years on. Distressed Terry Jeans, 67, fought a long battle to bring the soldier's killer to justice after he was attacked in Croatia. Private Simon Jeans was set upon by a gang of thugs who hit him over the head with a rock on September 8, 1996. He died nine days later from a brain haemorrhage at Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, aged just 25. Parts of Pte Jeans' body - including his brain, lungs and heart - were held by Surrey Police as they investigated the murder. The organs were taken to King's College London to be forensically examined, and when the forensic department closed in 2000, they were transferred to Guy's and St Thomas' hospital. Mr Jeans, from Portsmouth, Hants, said he did not know the body parts had not been reunited with his son's body. He now wants to hold a ceremony to bury them - something which the Co-operative Funeralcare have quoted him around £1,600 to do. Mr Jeans said: 'Nobody has really said sorry. I haven't heard that word at all. 'These things don't seem to matter to the police, but they do to me.' Mr Jeans claims he had to spend around £20,000 to bring his son's killer to justice and said this new cost is something he simply cannot afford. Seeking an apology: Terry Jeans, 67, says he had no idea his son's organs had not been reunited with his body . He said: 'I have been alone doing this and they should be accountable for their errors. 'It is not about my son or the suffering that this has caused, it's about money and it shouldn't be that way.' Apology: Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital said it would liaise with the police to pay for the burial of Pte Jeans' organs . A spokesman for Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital said the body parts had been stored in a 'sensitive and secure way', adding that once the hospital identified them last year it had contacted the police forces involved. The spokesman said: 'Guy's and St Thomas' would like to apologise to the families affected for the distress that this situation has caused them.' The hospital also said it would liaise with police to reach an agreement to help Terry with the costs. Detective Inspector Jon Vogel, from Surrey Police, said: 'At the forefront of our minds throughout this sensitive operation is the need to respect the concerns and wishes of families. 'We need to give them a clear, compassionate and open account of the circumstances, and to assist them in the return of the remains of their loved one should they wish it.' Terry said: 'They should be putting right what they have done wrong. It has only made me hateful.'","Private Simon Jeans died of a brain haemorrhage in 1996 after a gang hit him over the head with a rock .

It is by far the largest, and possibly the craziest, infrastructure project in British history. It is not green. It will destroy town and country the length of the land. It is presented as a much-needed boost for the economy, but the boost will likely come during the next boom, when such reckless public spending will seem foolish. Elaborate plans: Former British Rail Board member Simon Jenkins says the HS2 is total waste of money . Since HS2 is ‘premium fare’, its chief beneficiaries will be existing first-class passengers out of Euston. This may be a deserving group, but they are hardly the poor struggling masses yearning to breathe free. Yet George Osborne wants to subsidise them to the tune of £1,000 from every taxpayer in the land. Last week the Government admitted yet another hike in HS2 spending, from £33 billion to £43 billion. The criticism became a deluge. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, called it ‘complete madness’. One of her Tory members, Richard Bacon, added: ‘Everyone thinks it’s going to be £70 billion, £80 billion, £100 billion by the time it’s finished.’ That is double the present estimate. Last month the National Audit Office declared even the existing case for the project at best unproven. The proclaimed increase in business hours was declared minimal, since people can now work on a train. The list of HS2’s opponents would fill a page and embrace most of its original architects, such as Lord Prescott, Alistair Darling and Lord Mandelson. Prescott called it a ‘con on the north’. Mandelson admitted last week that it was always a political project, intended ‘to paint an upbeat view of the future’. City leaders in Birmingham and Manchester supported it, but were not asked if they would prefer the money for something else, such as urban transit systems, a new trans-Pennine link or an extension to the M65. The railway has opponents as diverse as the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Socialist Workers Party, the Economist magazine and the environmentalist George Monbiot, the Engineering Employers Federation, the RAC, the Countryside Alliance, the Taxpayers Alliance and wildlife trusts galore. In a savage letter to The Times, Adam Mills, former boss of the first Channel link, HS1, said claims being made for the new line were ‘away with the fairies’. HS2’s friends are almost exclusively those with a political or financial interest in it. The Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, asserts that it will ‘bridge the north-south gap’ and ‘compete with China’. Limited benefit: The plan has come under increasing criticism, with even former Labour Business Secretary Peter Mandelson warning that it could be an 'expensive mistake' He does not explain why competing with China means avoiding the existing Euston-Midlands transport corridor and crashing through some of the loveliest country in England. McLoughlin and the line’s chief cheerleader, Lord Adonis, deflect criticism from this geographical nonsense by claiming HS2 will at least liberate capacity on lines into Euston. Since it is premium class, it will do so in a very limited way. Nor does the Minister explain why the train is to arrive at Euston and not link with either Heathrow or the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras. It does not even link to London’s new Crossrail. The ‘train of the future’ will reach neither of London’s international transport hubs. I served on the British Rail Board in the 1990s. Every investment battle was between glamour projects that appealed to Ministers and the mundane needs of passengers. The railway was still only half electrified and much of its signalling was Victorian, yet time and money were exhausted on building a tilting train that never worked. Every train pundit knows that the quickest and cheapest way to increase capacity is to re-engineer platforms, signals and rolling stock. The 2012 Atkins report on alternatives to HS2 (now forgotten) showed that redeveloping Euston could deliver a cost-benefit ratio of one to four – twice the benefit of HS2. Threat: The Cheshire countryside where the proposed HS2 link between London and Manchester may run . Britain’s conventional railway desperately needs investment. It is shaming, long after most of the rest of Europe is electrified, that diesels still leave Paddington for the west country and chug round most of the feeder lines on the network. Cross-country services into Wales are dire. If McLoughlin wants to reduce overloading, he should look at the commuter lines in the Bristol area, in Lancashire and in Yorkshire. Yet he is blowing the lion’s share of rail investment for 20 years on a well-heeled group at Euston. To oppose HS2 is not to be nimbyist, much as some Ministers like to see things that way. There is no overriding national interest in tearing up open countryside when other means of transport are available. There are 100 more productive uses for £50 billion of infrastructure spending. New motorways would deliver four to five times more economic benefit than HS2. The parallel is exact with Concorde in the 1970s, a high-profile project that played to Harold Wilson’s high-tech obsession. Its backer was Tony Benn, who fought against all attempts to kill it at birth, musing recently on the BBC that ‘it will always be an icon’. Concorde was a taxpayer gift to the rich, a classic French-style grand project intended to yield political glory. Benn made it fly over the cabinet room to give his friends an exhilarating bang – the most expensive bang in history. Concern: Simon Jenkins says that claims for the line are 'away with the fairies' High-speed trains are for long distances. Britain’s compact geography and the need for frequent train stops make speed less critical to journey times. Fast trains are also energy inefficient, necessitating an estimated 60 per cent more carbon than ordinary trains because, unlike in France, we have little benefit of nuclear power. Even in France the TGVs are losing their glamour. They have led French railways into £34 billion of debt. A halt has been called to new lines and SNCF has announced it will redirect investment to high-volume commuter lines. Modern rail passengers in a country such as Britain want comfort and reliability rather than marginally faster journeys. Time spent in trains is no longer seen as wasted. A wise railway goes for many small investments, not one big one. This leaves the intriguing question, if the case for HS2 is so weak, how does it survive? The answer was given by David Cameron in opposition. He warned that special interest lobbying ‘has tainted our politics for too long,’ and needed curbing. He has not curbed it. Hundreds of millions of pounds have been spent by taxpayers on HS2, meaning a list of consultancies and contractors that is almost as long as that of the line’s opponents. These lobbyists have open access to Whitehall, to ask Ministers for ever more in the trough. George Osborne usually resists calls to spend public money. But curiously enough, when the HS2 lobby arrives in Whitehall, his smile is wide and his pockets are deep. That is what Cameron was talking about, once.","List of HS2’s critics would fill a page and quite rightly, says Simon Jenkins .

A newsreader from ITV who underwent a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with cancer has revealed how she held a 'boobs party' to say goodbye to her breasts before going under the knife. Bridgid Nzekwu, who suffered from cancer as a teenager, was shocked to learn the disease had returned when she developed a tumour in one of her breasts. But when she received her diagnosis, she resolved to take immediate action and decided to have both her breasts removed to minimise the risk of the cancer spreading. The 42-year-old mother of one underwent her double mastectomy in April, and three months later has documented the harrowing experience in a diary published by the Sunday Times. Soon after leaving school, Ms Nzekwu was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, and underwent a gruelling round of radiotherapy until she was given a clean bill of health. She went on to develop a successful career as a newsreader for Channel 4 and then ITV, and had a son, Oscar, with her husband Martin. However, last year she was told that a lump on her left breast which has previously been benign had developed into a malignant tumour. Poignantly, it seems that the cause of the cancer was the high dose of radiation she received during her lymphoma treatment two decades earlier. 'I feel an overwhelming surge of panic,' Ms Nzekwu wrote of the moment her breast cancer was diagnosed. 'I can't get cancer again. I'm a cancer survivor not a cancer victim. Chemo, vomiting, exhaustion, baldness: that was another life.' Because of her earlier radiotherapy, the newsreader had been exposed to the maximum dose of radiation considered safe over the course of a lifetime, meaning the only treatment option was the removal of the affected breast. Doctors told her that she had a 25 per cent chance of developing cancer in the other breast too - and Ms Nzekwu immediately resolved to undergo a double mastectomy. 'My right breast is perfectly healthy, but there's no guarantee it will stay that way,' she wrote. 'To me it's a ticking time bomb. I know immediately I want a double mastectomy. I feel in a state of perfect clarity. The only thing that's important is to get this cancer out of me and do anything in my power to prevent it from coming back.' Publicity: Angelina Jolie has drawn attention to the plight of women undergoing mastectomies . Ms Nzekwu was racked by fears of not being there to see three-year-old Oscar grow up, and was acutely conscious that her own mother had died of cancer aged just 59. Nonetheless, she was able to keep up a healthy demeanour, and even held a 'boobs party' with 30 of her friends, who gathered three days before the surgery. She wrote: 'We toast my ""departing assets"" and the girls joke about how envious they will be of the new, tummy-tucked body I'll be rocking after the operation.' The nine-hour operation at the Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea thankfully went without a hitch - despite her husband's trepidation - but Ms Nzekwu was still tormented by her post-surgery appearance. She wrote about her 'disturbing' torso, and her fears that Martin would find her unattractive, but when the bandages were taken off her chest she was pleasantly surprised by how she looked. Ms Nzekwu has now largely recovered from the procedure - she is able to play with her son and carry out household chores, and is planning to return to work soon. The dilemma faced by women who are highly susceptible to breast cancer was highlighted earlier this year by Hollywood star Angelina Jolie, who revealed that she elected to have a double mastectomy after learning that she carried a faulty gene which often leads to the disease.","Bridgid Nzekwu suffered cancer as a teenager and disease returned in 2012 .

Paul Gascoigne was seen drinking from a bottle of gin just hours after he was released on bail following an arrest for an alleged assault on his ex-wife, it was claimed today. The 46-year-old ex-England and Newcastle player went into a corner shop in North London, bought the alcohol and opened it at the counter as he was waiting for change. The former football star, who left rehab earlier this year, was arrested over an alleged drunken assault on ex-wife Sheryl on Thursday. Off the wagon: Former football star Paul Gascoigne was caught on CCTV buying a bottle of gin, and drinking it before he had even been given his change, in a shop in North London on Friday . He was held on bail overnight, but just four hours after his release, the former alcoholic was filmed on CCTV buying a bottle of gin, The Sunday Mirror reports. The shopkeeper told the newspaper that the former ace had turned up in the Camden store around 2.40pm on Friday and had asked for the alcohol at the counter. ‘He grabbed the bottle as soon as I put it on the counter. 'He opened it and drank it neat while I got some change for his £10,’ the cashier said, adding that Gascoigne looked like ‘a mess’. A shopper, who recognised the star and took a picture with him, said Gascoigne appeared to have been wearing the same clothes for days. Relapse: Gascoigne, posing with Sheryl and their children Regan and Bianca for his 46th birthday in May, was arrested on Thursday after allegedly assaulting his former wife at a train station in Hertfordshire . Gascoigne made his dishevelled appearance at the shop shortly after he was released on bail over an alleged assault at a Hertfordshire railway station on Thursday. The Mirror reported that Gascoigne had grabbed a security guard by the throat before grabbing the arm of ex-wife Sheryl Gascoigne when she tried to step in. According to the newspaper, he was bailed after being held in a police cell for 12 hours overnight. A police spokesman told the newspaper there were two allegations of common assault, the first being against a station security guard. The spokesman said a 46-year-old man is alleged to have grabbed the security guard around the neck, while the second allegation concerned a member of the public who arrived during the incident. Friday morning, Bianca Gascoigne, Sheryl’s daughter from a previous marriage who was adopted by the footballer, was seen leaving her mother’s £800,000 converted farmhouse near Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire. Mother's daughter: Bianca Gascoigne leaves her mother's house on Friday morning following her adoptive father's arrest . Bianca kept her sunglasses on as she was driving from the converter farmhouse in Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire . The news comes as it emerges Gascoigne’s bid to stay sober failed a month ago – and was caught on camera by a film crew. Gascoigne was being filmed for a documentary about his sober life after rehab, when he had a relapse in front of the cameras, the Sun on Sunday reports. The breakdown ‘is likely to be played out to the public,’ a source told the newspaper. Earlier . this year, Gascoigne said he wanted to 'get back to reality' after the . latest health scare in his battle with alcohol addiction. He . told ITV1's Daybreak in March: 'I didn't ask to be an alcoholic, but I . must admit I worked on it. I went to any lengths to get my drink, I'll . go even further to stay sober.' Volatile: Paul and Sheryl Gascoigne married in 1996 and divorced a little over two years later, but despite allegations of her ex-husband beating her Sheryl has tried to help him beat his alcoholism . Rehab: Paul Gascoigne, pictured on ITV's 'Daybreak' in March, spent time at a £100,000 rehab facility in Arizona, paid for by several famous friends, and swore he would never touch alcohol again . In May, Gascoigne was pictured looking healthier than he had in years as he celebrated his 46th birthday at the races with his family. He was pictured smiling alongside with ex-wife Sheryl, their son Regan and Bianca, at the Royal Windsor Racecourse. Gascoigne went into rehab earlier this year, paid for by his friends, including Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans, Piers Morgan, and former England cricketer Ronnie Irani. After he left the rehabilitation centre in Phoenix, Arizona, he told ITV's Daybreak how he begged doctors not to let him die. He said he was rushed to hospital where medics did not think he was going to survive. And in April he thanked the celebrities and footballers, including Wayne Rooney, Jack Wilshere and Steven Gerrard, who helped to pay towards his stint in rehab. Hundreds of thousands of pounds were raised within just days to meet the £7,500-a-week clinic fees.

A customer has won damages for harassment against a bullying bank who bombarded her with hundreds of unwanted phone calls. Amanda Roberts, 48, received 550 calls from the Halifax Bank of Scotland during a seven-month period after she missed a single payment on a loan. She preferred to deal with her branch in person rather than call centre staff, but they refused her repeated requests to stop the constant calls. Hard-won win: Amanda Roberts, 48, of Dewsbury has won her harassment case against Halifax bank after she received 550 calls over a missed loan payment . Miss Roberts received 92 calls during a fortnight and eight on one day alone and became a 'nervous wreck' with the stress caused by the 'rude and uncaring' bank. She felt so angry about her treatment that she sued for harassment. Miss Roberts, a former bar worker with no qualifications, represented herself during a gruelling five-year legal battle. And she won her case against all the odds, despite being up against a team of expensive lawyers. Her victory was only possible because she recorded 61 calls on her mobile phone and produced them as evidence. Judge Shaun Spencer, QC, sitting at Bradford County Court awarded Miss Roberts £7,500 damages and said some of the bank staff's remarks were 'unacceptable.' All on record: Amanda recorded several phone conversations with the call centre during the months of harassment, where staff repeatedly told her they would not stop calling her . He said: 'I was shocked when I read some of the utterances which were given out from the call centre.' Miss . Roberts said: 'They were nasty, they were offensive and it was . shocking. I didn't want to be pestered by phone calls, I wanted to deal . with them in person at the bank.' But . refusing to take no for an answer, the call centre repeatedly phoned . her mobile and her parents' home, where she used to live, from 8am until . 9pm. 'They wouldn't stop . ringing and when I asked for a supervisor they hung up on me. I was . absolutely devastated and paralysed, I was angry, shaking and tearful. I . couldn't eat or sleep because of the calls. 'I wouldn't open my door or my blinds because I was so worried about . the bank and what they might do. I was left a nervous wreck.' Miss Roberts, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was unable to work because of a stress-related health problem and living off benefits at the time the problems began in December 2007. She was making £115 monthly repayments on a £7,350 bank loan when her benefits were late coming into her account and she missed a repayment. Miss Roberts received a letter giving . her a date in the following month to repay the money by and she went . into her branch to sort it out before the deadline. Long battle: Despite explaining to staff at the call centre that she would rather deal with the staff at her branch, Miss Roberts would receive phone calls up to eight times a day for seven months . Bank worker: Is that Amanda Roberts? Miss Roberts: I've spoken to people like you before and I keep asking you to not ring me up and to contact me in writing if you need to contact me. Bank worker: Well it's urgent we speak to you, that's why we're ringing you today.Miss Roberts: Well I've told you that I will go into my bank and see them. I don't want people ringing me up over and over again and to have to keep telling them this. Bank worker: Right. Well you've given this number as a contact number.Miss Roberts: I haven't actually. And another thing, right, I'd like you to take this number off your records...how many times a day are you going to ring me? Bank worker: Well, until you speak to us and co-operate with us, we are going to continue to call you with regards to this matter. (later in the conversation) Miss Roberts: How long is this going to go on? Can you take this number off your records because this is harassment and this is making me ill.Bank worker: Right, okay, madam but we need to contact you so we are going to call you on this number.Miss Roberts: So you're going to carry on ringing me? Bank worker: Yes, right, until you're willing to speak to us, madam. Miss Roberts: 'You're going to carry on ringing me and you will not stop ringing me? Right.Bank worker: No, we're not going to stop ringing you, madam, no. (Two days later she speaks to another bank worker) Miss Roberts: Why am I getting these calls when I keep asking you to stop ringing me? Bank worker: That's Amanda, yes? Miss Roberts: Did you hear me? Bank worker: Yes Miss Roberts: Can you hear me? Why am I getting these calls when I keep asking you to stop ringing me? Bank worker: Is this Amanda I am talking to, yes? Miss Roberts: Are you deaf? Bank worker: Right, Amanda. We won't stop the calls unless we talk to you.Miss Roberts: And do you know that I keep asking over and over again for you not to ring me? And I will contact my bank directly and speak to them.Bank worker: Right . Miss Roberts: Over and over again I keep asking you and you keep ringing me. I'm getting called at 8.10 in the morning and 9.50 at night.Bank worker: You will do.Miss Roberts: I will do? Over and over again? Bank worker: Yes. Do you want me to stop the calls coming out to you? Miss Roberts: Excuse me, how many times have I asked? Stop ringing me.Bank worker: Okay. We'll give you a ring later.Miss Roberts: No you won't.Bank worker: Yes we will. Miss Roberts: Oh and you're just going to keep doing it over and over again? Bank worker: Yes until you talk to us. However, . the issue was not resolved because the bank had 'blocked' her account . in error and staff at the branch refused to sort it out. Miss Roberts . said she was keen to protect her credit history but the calls continued . despite paying her arrears when the block was lifted from her account. 'If I had not recorded the calls I wouldn't have had a chance of proving anything,' she said. She decided to take action on a 'matter of principle' and received £5,000 Legal Aid which paid for initial advice from a solicitor and the opinion of a barrister. When the case came to court she represented herself and after losing the harassment case the bank spent £30,000 on an appeal, which they also lost. Helped by two friends, Miss Roberts travelled to London to face the Appeal Court judges, who last month backed her rather than the highly paid bank QC. 'I couldn't give up, if I had given up I would have felt finished. They have tried to crush me from the day this started. It was never about the money, I wanted to be heard and to prove a point. 'I have never received an apology from the bank and I just hope they now change the way they work.' Miss Roberts said she hoped now to get on with her life, but she could yet face financial ruin. She still owes more than £10,000 to the bank and although the bank must pay most of her legal costs, she has to pay its fees for three days of court hearings - likely to be between £10,000 and £30,000. A Halifax spokeswoman said: 'This case dates back several years and we are confident that our policies and procedures have long since been updated, addressing the concerns raised in the judgment.'","Amanda Roberts, 48 was harassed by Halifax call centre staff .

Two innocent men who were wrongly convicted of murder in North Carolina and imprisoned for a total of 31 years have received $12.475 million from the state's Bureau of Investigation. Floyd Brown, a mentally disabled man locked up for 14 years, will receive $7.85 million for being falsely imprisoned, while Greg Taylor, who was held for 17 years, is to get $4.625 million. The payouts come as yet more embarrassment for the agency, which also settled with a man in 2009 after he wrongly spent nine years on death row - and Taylor said his hefty payout shows the State Bureau of Investigation is admitting it made a mistake. Payout: Greg Taylor, left, will receive $4.625 million for being wrongly imprisoned for 17 years for a murder he did not commit, while Floyd Brown, right, will receive $7.85 million for wrongly serving 14 years . Brown, who has an IQ of 50, was held in a psychiatric hospital for the murder of Katherine Lynch, a retired schoolteacher who was found beaten to death in her home in 1993. Witnesses said her killer was African-American, and officers pulled in Brown for questioning, although he did not resemble the suspect. No evidence tied him to the case and shortly after it was tested, sheriff's deputies lost nearly all of the physical evidence, the Charlotte Observer reported. Nevertheless, he was locked up after an SBI agent produced a six-page confession after interrogating Brown. His attorneys said the details were too elaborate for Brown to have given. Moving on: Brown was never given a trial as it was deemed he did not have the mental competency deemed necessary to stand trial. He is now living with a caretaker and enjoys trips to Burger King . Thrown out: The only evidence linking Brown, who has an IQ of 50, to the crime was a confession he allegedly gave investigators during an interrogation. A judge ruled this was not enough to prove his guilt . Brown, who has the mental capacity of . a seven-year-old, was never brought before a jury as he did not have . the mental competency to stand trail. He was sent to Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh. But in 2007, he was freed by Durham County Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson, who determined Brown's confession was not enough to prove he had killed Lynch. He now lives with a caretaker. His attorney, David Rudolf, said Brown likes Burger King and cleaning and asked to ride in a BMW when he returned home. His caretaker now drives him around in a used BMW 525, Rudolf said. He also enjoys just sitting behind the wheel of the parked car. Greg Taylor was in his 20s when he was jailed for the beating death of Jacquetta Thomas, who was found bludgeoned and abandoned in a cul-de-sac in East Raleigh in 1991. Mistake: Taylor was in his 20s when he was convicted of beating Jacquetta Thomas, right, to death in 1991 . Lost family: When he was jailed for life, he left behind a young daughter, Kristen, pictured left . The father-of-one spent 17 years locked . up in North Carolina prisons until a three-judge panel declared him . innocent in 2010. During the hearing, witnesses went back on their . original statements. It came after he was represented by an independent commission concerned with cases of people who maintained their innocence. During . the hearing, it emerged that an SBI lab report said officers found . blood in Taylor's truck. But a subsequent test showed it was not human . blood - and these results were never reported by the agent. It had been . the only physical evidence allegedly linking him to the crime. Since . being freed, he has tried to settle back into a normal routine with . visits to the gym and to his grandsons. When he was locked up, he left . behind a daughter, who is now married with two children. Reunited: Taylor is pictured left with Kristin after he was exonerated in 2010, and right at a family gathering . Back home: Taylor is pictured with his daughter, grandson, son-in-law and other family members . Last year, he told WRAL: 'You just can't undo 17 years in two years, or even five years, maybe. You don't have any future with a life sentence, so you just kind of give up all those hopes, all those aspirations. 'If I was hopeful of anything today, I would be hopeful to find some purpose for what I've been through. I'm trying to learn how to be 50 years old when my mind still thinks I'm 30.' Taylor told the Observer he was now looking to the future, but added that the state agreeing to settle  is an indication that they wronged him. 'The fact that . they settled speaks for itself,' he said, adding he will live on the money and use some for a safety net for his daughter and her family. Locked up: Taylor walked from Central Prison in Raleigh last year after 17 years behind bars . Freed: Brown was held at a psychiatric hospital, Dorothea Dix Hospital, for 14 years before he was released . Attorney General Roy . Cooper has not acknowledged any wrongdoing by his agents but said it was . an opportunity to look forward, thanks to better interrogation methods . and lab techniques. In the aftermath of the exoneration, . Duane Deaver, the SBI agent whose misconduct was central to the ruling, . was fired for his actions in other cases. Special Agent Mark Isley, who was involved in Brown's case, is still employed as a supervisor at the SBI on a salary of $86,215. The settlements are not the first large payouts stemming from SBI misconduct, the Charlotte Observer reported. In 2009, the SBI and its insurers agreed to pay $3.9 million to Alan Gell, who mistakenly spent nine years on death row for a murder he did not commit.","Floyd Brown, who has an IQ of 50 and the mental capacity of a seven-year-old, was jailed for 14 years before he was released in 2007 .

"It has now been handed over to the Police Service of Northern . Ireland . By . Bob Graham . PUBLISHED: . 16:10 EST, 6 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:10 EST, 6 July 2013 . The night of December 7, 1972,  is forever branded on Michael  McConville’s memory. That night a gang of masked IRA terrorists smashed down the door of his family’s West Belfast home and dragged out his mother Jean, as  several of her ten children clutched at her skirts and screamed. It was the last time Michael, then 11, was to see his mother alive. Horror: The remains of IRA murder victim Jean McConville are recovered from an area near the Templetown beach in County Louth in 2003 . Now, at last, the McConville children are on the verge of hearing – from beyond the grave – the confession of the IRA woman who drove their mother to her death. And in an explosive testimony, she is believed to have named Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, as the IRA commander who ordered the execution of Michael’s mother. Gerry Adams is accused of ordering the 1972 execution . Yesterday, 11 clandestine tapes recorded by Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries, which have  languished for ten years in the archives of the Burns Library in Boston College in the US, were handed over to the Police Service of Northern Ireland. They include an admission from Dolores Price, one of the IRA’s most infamous terrorists, that she ferried Michael’s 37-year-old mother to the Irish Republic where she was tortured, tied up and shot in the head. And she asserts it was Gerry Adams who sanctioned the murder. Adams, who now sits in the Republic of Ireland’s parliament, has always strenuously denied belonging to the IRA and any involvement in terrorist murders. But Michael McConville, now 51, believes the tapes’ shocking contents could lead to fresh arrests – among them that of Adams. Price’s damning revelation is  corroborated in another tape, made by Brendan ‘Darkie’ Hughes, the terror-hardened deputy commander of the IRA’s Belfast Brigade. He, too, insists it was Adams who signed the Catholic Belfast housewife’s death warrant. Yet Adams claims credit for shaping the 1996 peace agreement that ended Ulster’s Troubles after he swapped the ArmaLite for the ballot box. Price and Hughes, now both dead, agreed to make the tapes with Irish academics on the strict proviso they remain locked away while they lived. Price’s death in January this year freed the Boston College from its obligation to keep them secret. The release of the tapes has been at the centre of a bitter legal wrangle. Sinn Fein’s Martin McGuinness, Deputy First Minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly and a self-confessed former IRA commander, and US Secretary of State John Kerry have waged a high-profile battle to have them suppressed on the grounds that they could derail Ulster’s fragile peace process. Mrs McConville with her husband and three of her ten children . For Michael and his siblings, their hope is that the recordings may at last lead to their mother’s executioners being brought to justice. ‘If Price mentions Gerry Adams in the tapes, that he was in some way involved and if it can be proved, he should be tried,’ Michael says. ‘At the very least I’d like to see him stand in court and answer the accusations. 'You can’t turn around and say it is right to kill someone the way they did, especially a mother, no matter what your beliefs are.’ Michael’s mother, Jean, a Protestant who converted to Catholicism when she married husband Archie, had moved to the staunchly Republican Divis Flats in the Lower Falls area after being intimidated out of a Loyalist area. When the IRA eventually confessed to abducting and killing her, they claimed it was because she was a ‘tout’ who was passing information to the British Army. Gerry Adams (centre) pictured attending an IRA funeral during the troubles . The McConville family has always insisted that their mother’s only involvement with the Army was  that she once gave succour to an injured squaddie. Michael has yet to hear the tapes. But shortly before she died Delores Price chillingly told me of her role in the murder of his mother – one of 17 IRA victims known as the  Disappeared. She told me that her memoir, including her role driving away the Disappeared, was recorded in the Boston Project – as the collection of tapes are known. Price, who led the IRA terror squad that bombed the Old Bailey in 1973, admitted she drove Mrs  McConville to Dundalk in the Irish Republic. She confessed she was a member of a select unit of the IRA’s Belfast Brigade, codenamed the Unknowns, whose mission was to take those believed to have betrayed Republicans for interrogation. For those found guilty by the Republican kangaroo courts, the only sentence was death.‘I never knew for sure their ultimate end, I was simply told by Gerry Adams to take the people away,’ Gerry Adams with one-time friend Brendan 'Darkie' Hughes, who was a . deputy commander of the IRA's Belfast Brigade and also insisted it was . Adams who signed the Catholic Belfast housewife's death warrant . Price admitted. ‘Some, I knew their fate, some I didn’t. I took seven in all. My job was to hand them over to others. I don’t even remember some of their names. ‘I drove Jean McConville away. She was a very, very unpleasant woman. I know I shouldn’t speak ill of the dead and I don’t think she deserved to die. I didn’t know she was a mother. ‘I had a call one night and Adams was in a house down the Falls Road. McConville had been snatched and held for several days. 'It was part of my job to take them across the border to hand them over. She got into my car and as far as she was concerned she was being taken to a place of safety by the Legion of Mary [a Catholic charity]. Son Michael McConville believes the tapes' shocking contents could lead to fresh arrests ¿ among them that of Adams . ‘She went on and on about “them f****** Provies, they wouldn’t have the balls to shoot me. F*** them”. I was saying to myself “please don’t say any more”. But she went on and on, she convicted herself out of her own mouth. 'It wasn’t my decision to “disappear” her, thank God. All I had to do was drive her. I even got her fish and chips and cigarettes before I left her.’ Price refused to enlarge on why Adams ordered Mrs McConville’s execution, but commented: ‘You don’t deserve to die if you are an unpleasant person, as she was, but you do deserve to die if you are an informer. Particularly in a war. That is the Republican way.’ For the McConville children, their mother’s death blighted their lives for ever. Today a fragmented family, they rarely meet or discuss the trauma of her being taken. Michael remembers his older brother Archie, then 16, followed the terrorists dragging his mother onto the street, begging: ‘Can I go with my Mammy?’ One of the gunmen took him aside, put his pistol to the teenager’s temple and told him to ‘f*** off’. He added: ‘Not long after she was taken, a local IRA man knocked on the door and handed Mum’s purse and wedding ring to my sister. I knew then she hadn’t just been murdered but executed. We found out she had been taken to a beach, had her hands tied, was knocked to the ground beside what would be her own grave and shot in the head.’ The Provisional IRA immediately imposed a menacing omerta among the West Belfast community. To talk of Jean McConville’s fate was to invite a visit from a death squad.’ When, 30 years after her abduction, the IRA admitted they had killed Mrs McConville, exhaustive searches found no body. Then, in August 2003, walkers stumbled upon her remains buried on Shelling Hill beach, Dundalk. Now, for Michael McConville and his family, justice is at last in sight.","Adams is accused of ordering execution of mother-of-ten Jean McConville .

Critical: Sir Ian Kennedy, Chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, wants to trim down MPs' perks . Gold-plated pensions and ‘goodbye grants’ worth tens of thousands of pounds for MPs could be scrapped under an overhaul of parliamentarians’ pay. The perks have been branded a reminder of the ‘old, cushioned world of privilege’ by Sir Ian Kennedy, the chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA). This week the watchdog is expected to unveil a scaling back of the ‘excessively generous’ pensions entitlements and golden goodbyes that many MPs enjoy as part of IPSA’s review of pay and expenses. However Sir Ian is also expected to controversially suggest a pay rise for MPs of around £10,000. This would take their basic pay to around £76,000. Sir Ian has argued more pay is necessary to avoid a repeat of the 2009 expenses scandal. But Sir Ian said that overall, his proposed reforms would make MPs cheaper for the taxpayer. It is believed he will target pensions and resettlement grants in an attempt to thwart public anger over any pay rises. MPs who lose their seats can get up to £33,000 to help them ‘resettle’ into ordinary life. The pay-off is virtually unheard of in the private sector, where many ordinary workers are made redundant with barely a few weeks’ severance pay. When 200 MPs lost their seats at the last general election, taxpayers had to fund £7 million in resettlement grants. Officials are also discussing ending final salary pensions for MPs. Currently, they pay 13.65 per cent of their annual salaries into the scheme - a higher contribution than most workers. Controversial proposal: Sir Ian's suggestion of a parliamentary pay rise of nearly £10,000 to £75,000 a year will be published in the coming week . However, they also get much more generous pay-outs, around £30,000 a year in retirement after 20 years. Taxpayers spend £13.5 million a year funding pensions of retired MPs. One proposal is to pay MPs a pension based on their average earnings during their parliamentary careers. This would be line to the deal given to millions of public sector staff which will be phased in from next April. Writing in the Sunday Times, Sir Ian said: ‘Given what has happened elsewhere in the public sector, MPs’ excessively generous pension arrangements seem out of place. ‘Similarly, resettlement allowances, which until recently were worth up to one year’s salary to compensate an MP who lost his or her seat or who decided to stand down from parliament, are a reminder of the old, cushioned world of privilege and make no sense to the general public. ‘The very notion that we have to ‘resettle’ former MPs is odd. These pay-outs are a historic peculiarity.’ David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have all argued against any pay rises for MPs at a time of austerity. Austerity: Nick Clegg, left, and David Cameron, right, have both advised against any pay rises for MPs . Controversy over the proposed pay rise grew as it emerged that around 200 Commons cleaners, cooks and manual workers faced the axe to pay for the pay rise. The move would have saved £6.5 million. But it was rejected by officials who warned of a public backlash if the money was funnelled back into pay rises for MPs. Sir Ian is expected to unveil his plans on Thursday, before they are put out for consultation. MPs will not have any say, however, as Parliament handed over the final decision to IPSA. In the past, MPs had a vote on their pay, a move which led to many vetoing pay rises for fear of looking greedy to their constituents.","Sir Ian Kennedy wants to cut down MPs'  pensions and 'goodbye grants'

Government Ministers tried to sack 200 Commons cleaners, cooks and manual workers to justify a £10,000 pay rise for MPs, it was claimed last night. The aim was to use the £6.5million staff savings to finance the salary hike for MPs and show that the overall cost of running Parliament had not gone up. But it was rejected after officials warned there would be uproar if MPs sacked low paid workers to give themselves a 15 per cent rise. The row was disclosed on the eve of a new pay deal for MPs which is expected to say they deserve a £10,000 rise on their £66,396 salary. All three party leaders have expressed doubts about a big pay rise, but they are powerless to stop it because Parliament handed over control of MPs’ pay to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, headed by Sir Ian Kennedy who has hinted strongly he thought MPs deserved a significant pay hike. Instead, David Cameron hopes to avoid public furore by showing the overall cost of running Parliament has not gone up. Commons sources say senior officials have asked Parliamentary chiefs to find ‘substantial savings’ to offset the cost of the MPs’ rise. Outrage: One proposal would have meant sacking 200 cleaners from the Palace of Westminster . The officials were told the only way would be to get rid of more than 200 Commons workers, most of whom earn less than £20,000 a year. The Parliamentary chiefs warned any such move would be ‘grossly insensitive’. An insider said: ‘The idea that anyone could sack people who earn a fraction of an MPs’ salary to give them an extra ten grand is offensive.’",Plan would have limited overall cost of running Parliament despite pay rise .

Clinton spent most of her 45-minute talk to about 1,000 members of the American Bar Association assailing a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down a significant part of the Voting Rights Act and discussing what she sees as 'deep flaws in our electoral system' as it relates to racial discrimination at the polls.

Clinton spoke about maintaining the Voting Rights Act and received a medal from the association . Meanwhile, in a live-streamed interview with Buzzfeed’s Ben Smith Monday, Weiner said he knows what role his wife Huma Abedin will play in Clinton’s 2016 campaign, suggesting that Clinton has already made up her mind to run. Asked what that role will be, Weiner said, 'I’m not telling you.' Next month, Clinton intends to speak in Philadelphia about the 'balance and transparency necessary in our national security policies as we move beyond a decade of wars to face new threats.' Later, Clinton said she would discuss the implication of American's global leadership and the nation's moral standing around the world. First, however, she took on electoral reform and the assault on voting rights that she said threatens to block millions of Americans from fully participating in our democracy and to further erode public trust. She called on lawmakers to pass legislation countering the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down a requirement that 15 states get approval from the U.S. Department of Justice before changing election systems.

Clinton also criticized the ruling in a speech last month in Washington, D.C., to nearly 14,000 members of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, a black women's organization celebrating its 100th anniversary. On Monday, she said some observers have defended the U.S. Supreme Court ruling as a sign that discrimination has ended. She disagreed and said it gave jurisdictions carte blanche to renew discrimination at the polls. 'In the weeks since the ruling we have seen an unseemly rush by previously covered jurisdictions that will make it harder for our fellow Americans to vote,' she said. 'Unless we act now, citizens will be disenfranchised and victimized by the law instead of served by it.' Clinton, right, is embraced by American Bar Association President Laurel Bellows before addressing the group's annual meeting Monday in San Francisco . She also said that even before the Supreme Court ruling, the United States faced a sweeping effort across the country to prevent many people from voting, 'often under cover of addressing a phantom epidemic of election fraud.' She said that more than 80 bills were introduced in 31 states this year to restrict elections rights. She conceded that not all proposed bills were racially motivated.

The Californian owner of a pit bull that went missing three years ago will be reunited with his dog tomorrow after it was found on the other side of the country. Smoke, the pit bull, was found in Florida after mysteriously disappearing from Eric Hough’s Huntington Beach home four months after it was adopted. The dog vanished the same day Hough evicted a problematic tenant who was renting a room in his five-bedroom house. Reunited: The pit bull, Smoke, was driven by volunteers from Florida to his home in California after disappearing three years ago . Pet detective: Ryan Gamache (right) tracked down Smoke's owner . Hough, a professional BMX rider, alerted the police but Smoke was never found. Authorities in Cocao, Florida, found the black pit bull on the street on June 6 and delivered it to a shelter as a stray. The shelter found the dog’s microchip and pulled up Hough’s details, but they were unable to reach him on the telephone numbers listed, so Smoke was put up for adoption. The pit bull’s story was posted on a local website that tries to unite pets with owners, which was seen by a Seattle-based pet detective, Ryan Gamache, who was intrigued by Smoke’s story. Gamache, who volunteers for a non-profit group called Missing Pet Partnership, tracked down Hough through his friends and sponsors. At first Hough thought it was a hoax and almost dismissed the group's approach, until Gamache mentioned his old address from which Smoke went missing. ‘I was like, ""Oh, wow. This is about me. Wait, is this about the pit bull?"" And it suddenly just came back. I was, like, two seconds away from losing the opportunity to ever get him back again,’ Hough told ABCNews.com. Smoke's owner, Eric Hough, is a professional BMX rider who lives in Huntington Beach, California . Coast to coast: Smoke traveled clear across the country, from California to Florida, before being found and reunited with his owner . Heather McNally and a nonprofit volunteer group called Kindred Hearts stepped in to help reunite Smoke with his owner. The group has volunteers across the country that help transport adopted and missing pets to their homes. The trip to pick up Smoke would have cost Hough about $2,500 and the volunteers told him there was no need. McNally mobilised the network of volunteers and broke the 2,500-mile trip from Florida to California into four days and 30 legs of driving. Helping hands: Volunteers across the country took turns driving Smoke from Florida to California . Smoke was driven home to California with the help of a network of nationwide volunteers . The non-profit group, Kindred Spirits, helped mobilise the team of volunteers across the country . Each volunteer drove about an hour and a half and some volunteers signed up to spend the night with Smoke in motels or houses. ‘People from all over the country that I've never met are doing all the driving for him,’ McNally told ABCNews.com. ‘It's almost addicting. Once you do it once, you just want to do another. It feels so good to be able to help a dog.’ Smoke's trip began on July 4 and he is scheduled to arrive home to Hough in California on Sunday night. ‘I'm very thankful for the people helping,’ Hough said. ‘It's just amazing that we're getting him back.’","Smoke, the pit bull, went on a 2,500-mile journey thanks to volunteers nationwide who took turns driving the dog over a four-day period .

Police and coastguards are today continuing the search for a 14-year-old girl who was last seen 'in difficulty' in the sea. Officers were called at 3.46pm yesterday to a report of concern for the girl, who was at Whitmore Bay, Barry Island, in South Wales. The girl is described as white, 5ft 7in tall, of average build with long black hair and last seen wearing a multi-coloured dress. Today the coastguard was due to carry out a lunchtime shoreline search of the bay while the tide is out. Emergency services were still trying to find out if the girl ever left the water. Inspector Bob Nicholls of South Wales Police said the teenager was in the bay with friends when she got into difficulty. 'She . was in the water with friends,' he said. 'We believe she has got into . some difficulty and we are looking for her at the moment. 'The coastguard has got three boats launched, South Wales Police helicopter and the search and rescue helicopter have been deployed. 'Numerous resources on foot have been deployed for the search. 'She was on holiday in the area. Her parents are aware and with officers at the moment.' A force spokesman said: 'South Wales . Police together with HM coastguard are currently searching the location . and a missing person enquiry is ongoing.' Anyone with information is asked to call South Wales Police on 101. Coastguards believe the girl could have been in difficulty in the water for up to an hour before the situation was reported to them. Steve Jones, rescue centre manager for HM Coastguard Swansea said: 'The incident was reported to us at 15.54 but we believe she could have been in trouble in the water up to an hour before then. 'We had a report that a fisherman saw her. We are dumbfounded that something . wasn't said to us earlier and are investigating but our main priority is . the search, which is massive.

'A coastguard rescue team from Barry is continuing to search landside. 'We don't believe that she was that far out in the water. We are going on the assumption that she has not come out of the water. 'Normally, if she had come out then we would have found her by now. 'The police are checking the address where she was staying. They are speaking to her friends who were in the water with her. 'We are really concerned and ask that if anyone has any information that they contact us. 'If she is still in the water, as the time passes by, our concerns grow even deeper.' Missing: The girl is described as white, 5ft 7in tall, of average build with long black hair and last seen wearing a multi-coloured dress .

Mr Jones said the team would continue . searching for as long as possible, though the helicopters would have to . refuel at some stage. 'The girl has to be somewhere,' he said. 'We just hope she is on land but are concentrating our efforts seawards.' A spokeswoman for the Maritime & . Coastguard Agency confirmed that the girl had been seen in difficulty an . hour before the alarm was raised. She said: 'At 3.54pm Swansea Coastguard was contacted by South Wales .

Luang Pu Nenkham Chattigo attracted global attention when a video clip of him was posted on YouTube, with his high-flying image somewhat at odds with the quiet life of reflection and meditative study synonymous with his religious title. Now the 34-year-old has been accused of being married, and having relationships with seven other women in a probe by Thailand's Department of Special Investigations. Scroll down to watch video . High flyer: One of the Buddhist monks featured in the YouTube cilip, Luang Pu Nenkham Chattigo, has been accused of being married, and a fake . Under investigation: The video clip received complaints from Buddhists across the globe, prompting a probe into the monks' behaviour . According to the department, Pu Nenkham, who is abbot of the Khantitham Forest Monastery in north eastern Thailand, is allegedly married to a woman called Yupinpraethong Janthawa. He has also been accused by a fellow monk of being a fake, and wearing the religious robes despite not being entitled to do so - a criminal offence in Thailand. Luang Pu Buddha Isara, the abbot at another monastery, filed the complaint againts Pu Nenkham  to Bangkok's Criminal Court. The allegations surrounding Pu Nenkham have shocked Thailand, which is home the largest number of Buddhists in the world. Shocking behaviour: The allegations surrounding Pu Nenkham have shocked Thailand, which is home to the world's largest Buddhist population . He is now being investigated by the Department of Special Investigations, and the Office of National Buddhism, which monitors the 200,000 monks in Thailand, according to the Daily Telegraph Newspaper. The investigation was launched following numerous complaints from Buddhists around the world after the two minute and 47 second long clip was posted on Youtube. The video showed monks, one of them Pu Nenkham, sporting fashionable mirrored shades and using wireless headphones on board the private plane. The clip also prompted the Office of National Buddhism's . director-general Nopparat Benjawatananun to warn the monks not to repeat the lavish behaviour, and there are plans for the watchdog to begin monitoring monks across Thailand. Pu Nenkham is also the focus of a money-laundering investigation, with a police colonel, Pong-in Intarakhao claiming that the abbot, along with others, had 41 bank accounts filled with cash from public donations to his monestry, with the accounts mostly in his name. Colonel Pong-in Intarakhao has also claimed that the monk owns two houses, as well as an incredible 13 cars and motorbikes. The abbot is currently believed to be in Europe, and has been ordered to return to his home country within the next 30 days by  Mr Benjawatananun. Accused: Pu Nenkham, who is abbot of the Khantitham Forest Monastery in north eastern Thailand, is allegedly married to a woman called Yupinpraethong Janthawa .

Buddha's 2,600-year-old doctrine stand the test of time through a . variety of means, including imposing a ban on the sale of alcohol on . religious holidays.

The office also received complaints about monks driving cars, and scams and false claims of black magic uses by monks. Mr Nopparat has said the monks . in the video were acting 'inappropriately, not composed and not adhering . to Buddha's teachings of simplicity and self-restraint'. Monruedee . Bantoengsuk, an administrative officer at Khantitham Temple in Sisaket . province, confirmed that the monks on the private plane lived at the . temple but refused to give details about the trip. The . images from the video contrasted with the abbot's message on the . temple's homepage that read: 'The true core of those who preach Buddha's . teachings is to not to own any objects at all'. Mr Nopparat said: 'When . Lord Buddha was alive, there wasn't anything like this. There were no . cars, smart phones or cameras, so the rules were much simpler. 'While the . monks need to keep themselves abreast of new knowledge, current events . and technology, they are restrained to choose the appropriate tools.' He said one way to prevent the monks from misbehaving is for followers not to spoil them with valuable objects or vices. 'In . many cases, it was the followers who gave the monks the luxury. Some . bought them sports cars. This is by no means necessary.'

While most brides would be fussing about the last minute details in the days before their wedding, for Stevie Beale, from Toledo, Ohio, her focus was solely on whether she would be able to make it down the aisle. Waiting for her at the other end was 32-year-old Jared VanAusdale, who she credits with bringing her 'back to life'. Scroll down for video . Big day: Stevie Beale walks down the aisle with her father . Fairytale ending: Stevie has her first dance with husband Jared VanAusdale . Steps to a new life: Stevie goes to a rehabilitation center three times a week to help her walk . 'I was trying not to bawl like a baby in . front of 300 people. Seeing her on the walker, reaching that . goal that she swore she was going to hit, is something I will never . forget,' her husband said. Ms Beale lost all feeling from her belly button down after being involved in a car crash when she was in her junior year at high school, according to NBC Today. The former softball player and gymnastics coach broke her back and severed her spinal cord after the car she was in crashed into a tree at 76mph, killing the driver, Charlie, who was Ms Beale's best friend. The accident, caused after the teenagers were chased by a driver after one of the passengers threw a plastic bottle at a car, left Ms Beale feeling her life was over before it had begun. Wreckage: Stevie snapped her spinal cord in a car crash when she was 17 . Depressed: The student says she felt like her life was over as she tried to come to terms with her paralysis . 'I thought I was doomed to my parents' house, to never have a boyfriend or never get married,' she said. 'I . thought I was going to sit at home and rot away.' However, Ms Beale's life took a step in the right direction when her parents put her in touch with a therapy . center in Detroit, Michigan that focused on spinal cord . recovery work. 'The first appointment I had there was amazing because for the first time in six months people were looking at me as Stevie. Not that girl in a chair or Stevie, who got in that car accident.' Support: Stevie says Jared helped bring her back to life as she struggled to come to terms with being disabled . Superhero: Jared encouraged his 24-year-old fiancee to keep working towards her goal of walking up the aisle . While she was there, Ms Beale met others who had similar injuries to her own, and who were living fulfilling lives. The 24-year-old starting making contact with people who had suffered similar experiences, which soon led her to her future husband. While she was visiting 16-year-old Bri Mullinger, who had lost a leg and her best friend after being hit by a train, Ms Beale was introduced to Mr VanAusdale, who was a family friend. The couple hit it off immediately and soon Mr VanAusdale revealed he was falling for her. Ms Beale was cautious at first, but finally decided to give their relationship a try, saying: 'I’m glad I did. I always tell him that he gave me the . ability to enjoy life again and makes me continue to want to work hard.' Celebration: Stevie and friends on her bachelorette party . Perfect day: Stevie and Jared on their wedding day in Toledo . Her husband said: 'She could’ve felt sorry for herself.

He added: 'I never really saw her being in a chair . as a challenge just because if she was not in a chair, we would have . challenges in other aspects ... every couple goes through challenges.' After getting engaged while on vacation in Hawaii, the couple started to plan their wedding, which had a few special requirements, such as a tiled floor for her wheelchair. The couple settled on the Toledo railway station for their wedding, which Ms Beale said was 'exactly what I wanted'. From the start of their wedding planning, Mr VanAusdale encouraged his fiancee to attend physiotherapy sessions three times a week to help her achieve her goal, and helped her through the low points when she felt like giving up. 'It never really got easier, I just got better at it,' Ms Beale told ABC13, adding that the process of learning to walk again for her wedding was a low and painful one.

An official study published in 2009 revealed that two thirds of all fresh chicken on shelves is contaminated with the potentially lethal food poisoning bug . Food poisoning cases linked to . infected chicken are rising despite demands that supermarkets and . farmers stop putting customers at risk. An estimated 580,000 people each year . are falling ill with stomach upsets caused by campylobacter, the UK’s . most common cause of food poisoning. As many as 18,000 are so ill that they need hospital care while about 140 people die each year from the bug. New figures published by the Food . Standards Agency reveal the number of cases has been rising every year . for the past four years, despite the watchdog making tackling food . poisoning its number one priority. Trials on farms to increase security . and limit any chances of the spread of the bug have failed to bring down . the number of birds carrying the infection. At the same time, a number of . warnings to supermarkets to make sure the birds on their shelves are . clean appear to have failed to protect public health. A 2009 study revealed that two thirds . of all fresh chicken on shelves is contaminated with the potentially . lethal food poisoning bug. The latest evidence about the number of cases in humans suggests this situation has not improved. A draft copy of the annual report by . the FSA's chief scientist, Dr Andrew Wadge, reveals the officially . recorded number of campylobacter cases in humans last year was 72,571, . an increase of 0.4 per cent from 2011. It is thought the actual number of . cases is eight times higher, taking the total to 580,568, because the . vast majority of sufferers do not go to their GPs. The FSA and its advisers hoped that . putting in place improved hygiene controls and biosecurity measures on . chicken farms would reduce the number of infected birds. Its strategy, which was designed to reduce the number of contaminated chicken on farms by 50 per cent by 2010, has been a hopeless failure. In his report, Dr Wadge says: ‘Early indications from these projects suggest that compliance with these biosecurity interventions, as determined at a periodic audit, has not yet resulted in the campylobacter reductions that were predicted.’ Successive chief executives at the FSA have lambasted supermarkets for not doing enough to cut campylobacter contamination in the chicken they sell. Its then chief executive, Tim Smith, wrote to the chief executives of all the supermarkets in 2010 demanding action. This failed to bring about the desired result and Mr Smith is now the group technical director at Tesco. Following a failure to improve the situation, his successor, Catherine Brown, issued a new call for action in January this year, saying tackling campylobacter in chicken was her top priority. Crackdown: The Food Standards Agency has asked supermarkets to tackle the bacteria problem (file photo) Miss Brown called supermarket bosses to a meeting to discuss how to tackle the problem while she has hinted that stores may be required to remove chicken from sale unless they can guarantee the bug has been removed. She said it ‘unacceptable’ that two-thirds of chicken carry the disease, while a fifth are ‘highly contaminated’ at the time of purchase. However, yet again there is no evidence of any major drive by the supermarkets to protect customers, beyond introducing non-drip packaging. The Government watchdog is now considering drastic measures to clean up chicken and protect consumers. These include killing the bugs by either washing the meat with lactic acid or the use of blast freezing. A survey by Which? found 60 per cent of shoppers would be ‘unlikely’ to buy chicken that had been sprayed or washed with a mild acid. The FSA research said consumers would rather that the food industry provides clean and safe food, rather than treating it to disinfect it. Its study found more people would prefer to buy a chicken that had not been treated with lactic acid than one that had – 44 per cent versus 38 per cent. Dr Wadge’s report estimates that there are around one million cases of food poisoning from all sources each year, resulting in 20,000 hospital admissions and contributing to around 500 deaths. The cost to the UK economy in terms of treatment and lost days of work is put at £1.8billion a year. Norovirus, which has been linked to oysters, salmonella, listeria and e.coli are the other major causes of illness. The number of officially recorded cases of listeria, which is particularly linked to soft unpasteurised cheese, rose from 164 in 2011 to 184 in 2012. The disease is relatively rare but poses a particular risk to pregnant women, unborn babies and the elderly. As many as one third of sufferers admitted to hospital die from complications.","An estimated nearly 600,000 people each year fall ill because of bacteria .

"By . Sadie Nicholas . PUBLISHED: . 16:15 EST, 11 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:21 EST, 16 August 2013 . Sadie gets tetchy and on-edge if she hasn't worked out hard - even now . This morning I was in the gym at 7am as usual, pushing my body as hard as I could. A workout is part of my routine six days out of seven. I'll stay for an hour - up to two when there's time - and unless I leave drenched with sweat, my muscles smarting and feel-good endorphins rushing through my body, I'm tetchy and on edge for the rest of the day. Even now: when I'm eight months pregnant with my first baby. At a time when many women use their condition as an excuse to lounge on the sofa scoffing chocolate biscuits, I'm as disciplined about diet and fitness as I've ever been. I'm not an athlete, so there's no professional reason why I need to keep my body in shape. My outlook is more controversial. I'm terrified that pregnancy will leave me fat and unfit. I've been a slender size ten and  extremely fit for my entire adult life. It's such an integral part of my identity that the prospect of losing my figure makes me incredibly anxious. While I know I'm not alone - from posts on online parenting forums I can see there are countless other women who feel just as I do - admitting that you are actively trying to maintain your figure in pregnancy seems to be taboo. Until I was 17 weeks pregnant, I was running 10km several times a week, just as I have done for years. When that became too uncomfortable due to ligament pains as my body expanded, I hung up my running shoes and took on additional gym sessions - working up a sweat on the bike, rowing machine and cross trainer, as well as lifting weights and doing push-ups and leg lunges. While no one has said anything negative to me, I've come across several other expectant mothers who have been subjected to vile comments from strangers who object to seeing a pregnant woman running, cycling or working out. I'm just as disciplined about what I eat, too. I've never been on a diet or suffered from an eating disorder, but since my teens I've been controlled about what I eat to ensure I don't put on weight. My diet is balanced, including plenty of lean protein, fruit and veg, but I eschew bread, pasta and rice. Chips, cake and - pre-pregnancy - alcoholic drinks are for weekends only. I've never eaten a bag of crisps or sweets in my adult life because I don't like either and - other than alcohol - I've only ever drunk water. No fruit juice, fizzy drinks, tea or coffee: I simply don't like the taste. It's still the same now. There's been no pigging out on stodge for me, baby or no baby. Of course, my unborn child is my priority. Like any mum-to-be I'm mainly concerned that he or she will be born healthy and my mothering skills will be up to scratch. But, while I've revelled in discovering how my baby is developing inside me - the first scan reduced me and my husband, Jonathan, to tears of joyful disbelief, as did the baby's first fluttery kicks - I've been equally horrified by the changes happening on the outside. Sadie, pictured left, and right at 30 weeks pregnant, says despite all her efforts there is still sponginess to her arms . Compared to many women my age - 40 - I know I'm extremely fit and, usually, in good shape, but almost from the moment I discovered I was pregnant my bust got bigger and my waist thickened, making me feel self-conscious. And, despite all my efforts, there's a sponginess softening my usually defined biceps and shoulders, a smattering of cellulite on my bottom that didn't exist before and a fullness in my face which all lead to one conclusion: pregnancy is making me fat and unattractive. And I'm far from alone in my outlook. A recent study by University College London found that a quarter of pregnant British women are 'highly concerned about their weight and shape'. One in 14 expectant mums develop an eating disorder during pregnancy - often dubbed 'pregorexia' - where they exercise and limit food intake to extremes. One poll asked women what they feared most during pregnancy. While 10 per cent said their greatest concern was complications with the birth, a staggering 65 per cent said that not losing the weight after their baby was born was far more worrying. The medical and academic worlds are finally acknowledging that fear of putting on weight while pregnant is not merely a matter of vanity, but a serious issue that can affect a woman's mental health when she already feels vulnerable. Sadie thinks pregnancy is making her unattractive . I know there are people who will read this and assume I care more about staying slim than I do about my unborn baby. That couldn't be further from the truth. I feel hugely responsible for its wellbeing and would never do anything that might harm it. My husband - who, after 15 years together, has long understood my physical and emotional need to exercise each day - has been supportive, while reassuring me he still thinks I look great. And my GP, obstetrician and midwife have all said - as NHS guidelines do - that since my body is so used to intense daily exercise it would be more dangerous to stop, unless I feel unwell or there was a medical reason to do so. People who say I'm putting my needs before my baby's welfare should focus on the expectant mums I see smoking outside the local maternity unit and those who eat for two (you actually need only an extra 200 calories a day during pregnancy and only then in the final trimester). Research shows overweight women are not only more likely to have babies who go on to be obese adults, but that excess weight gain can trigger diabetes and life-threatening pre-eclampsia, and lead to foetal abnormalities. Dr Jessamy Hibberd, a consultant psychologist who is pregnant with her second child, believes there are several reasons why modern women are increasingly distressed by the way pregnancy changes our bodies. 'We're used to being able to control all the elements of our lives and our figures, but during pregnancy we can't do that,' she says. 'Social taboos play a part, too. There's still this message that pregnancy's a wonderful thing, yet the truth can be very different. 'Your hormones are all over the place . and you feel out of control, but saying anything negative is seen as a . sign you don't realise how lucky you are. 'Yet the happiness you feel . about your unborn baby and the anxiety about your changing body are two . separate things.' Still, I have to admit I'm well aware . there have been times when I've pushed myself too far and made myself . feel ill because my fear of getting fat has outweighed the nausea, . fatigue and often crippling pains that have beset my pregnancy. Consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician Clive Spence-Jones says exercising when pregnant is safe, though he urges caution. 'I advise pregnant women not to let . their pulse rate get above 140 beats per minute - you should still be . able to hold a conversation - and to be careful not to overheat or get . dehydrated,' he says. 'But if you're inactive while . pregnant then the chances are you're going to gain excess weight, which . puts you at higher risk of developing diabetes, requiring a caesarean . birth, losing blood after labour and needing an emergency . blood transfusion.' There's also plenty of evidence that . exercising and keeping weight gain within 21lb to 28lb is best for the . baby, too, as exercise increases blood flow to the foetus, strengthening . its heart, as well as minimising complications at birth. There have been occasions when it was tempting to lie in bed and do nothing but gorge on toast oozing with melted butter. I should have done that one morning last month when, instead, I went to the gym and then had to pull into a layby on the way home feeling dizzy and sick. Despite waking up feeling below par that morning, my terror of fatness had over-ruled my fatigue. It was a wake-up call. Now I accept that some days I need to take it easy. I'll still go to the gym, but I'll sit on the exercise bike rather than pump weights. Health willing, however, I'll still be in the gym the day before I give birth. How much weight have I gained? I have no idea and don't want to know. In fact, my midwife has weighed me only once, right at the start of my pregnancy, and was quite happy when I asked her not to tell me what the scales showed. Although I can still fit my legs into my size-ten designer  jeans, at 23 weeks pregnant I had to admit defeat. After a weekend in France wearing the jeans with a hair bobble holding the fly together because I could no longer do them up, I ordered a stash of maternity jeans. I know that the pressure I feel to be slim and fit comes entirely from me, not from friends or a family who abhor the very word 'diet'. Neither do I feel any desire to look like celebrities. It's simply that I'm a perfectionist - always have been - and put myself under pressure to achieve in all areas of my life. That said, I do take notice of fellow fitness fanatics such as singers Pink and Beyonce, who are in incredible shape after recently having babies. Far from condemning them for heaping pressure on ordinary women, I applaud them and find them inspiring. Sure, the celebs have more time and money than the rest of us to indulge in personal trainers, chefs and home gyms after birth, but ultimately you can't buy willpower.I'm not ashamed to admit I fully intend to be back in my skinny jeans within 12 weeks of my baby's arrival. Maximum. And I'll be exercising again as soon as is medically safe.","Sadie Nicholas gets tetchy and on-edge if she hasn't worked out hard .

Andy Murray today became the first British man to win Wimbledon for 77 years - and the last time the trophy remained in its home country, the UK was a very different place. The champion then was Fred Perry, one of the greatest tennis players in history, with eight grand slam titles including three victories at Wimbledon. But the game - and the world - would be almost unrecognisable to the legendary player if he were still alive today. Champions: But Andy Murray and Fred Perry occupied very different worlds and played a different game . Stylish: Perry was one of the greatest players of his or any era, and won eight grand slam tournaments . 77 years later: Andy Murray is the first British man to win Wimbledon since Perry's victory in 1936 . Perry, who was born in Stockport in 1909 and died in 1995, was a favourite of the Wimbledon crowds, but was ostracised by the British tennis establishment thanks to his maverick persona. He was hardly typical of the tennis players of the day, being a northerner without a public school background and the son of a Labour MP. Perry did not even take up the sport until he was 18 having concentrated on table tennis, in which he become a world champion in 1929. Fast around court and with a blistering forehand, he quickly rose to the top of the game. Fitness was also a big part of his game and he often trained with Arsenal Football Club. He became the first man ever to win all four of the grand slams, and ending up with three Wimbledon titles, three wins at the US Open, and one each in Australia and France, all achieved between 1933 and 1936. Popular: The 1930s star wowed the crowds with his dazzling play - but may have damaged tennis in the long term . Return: Perry pictured at the scene of his multiple triumphs in 1992, three years before his death . Tribute: This statue to Perry's memory was erected in the grounds of the All-England Club . Born: Perry in Stockport, Murray in Glasgow . Height: Perry 6ft, Murray 6ft 3in . Weight: Perry 12st, Murray 13st 8lb . Started playing tennis: Perry aged 18, Murray aged 3 . Wimbledon prize money: Perry £10, Murray £1.6million . Favourite food: Perry - boiled sweets, Murray - sushi . Grand slams: Perry 8, Murray 2 (so far) Perry was wildly popular with tennis fans, not only for his skills but for his rakeish personality - whenever an opponent hit a good shot he would quip 'very clevah', often infuriating them into making a mistake. However, he made an enemy of the tennis authorities by opting to turn professional in 1936, which barred him from competing in any more grand slams. Despite Perry's brilliance and his contribution to boosting the sport's popularity, he has sometimes been blamed for the dearth of British tennis success in the decades after his retirement, as young players would try to imitate his idiosyncratic playing style despite not having the talent to make a success of it. After his retirement, he enjoyed affairs with a series of Hollywood stars such as Jean Harlow, Marlene Dietrich and Loretta Young, and married four times - a stark contrast to Murray, who has been with his girlfriend Kim Sears since he was 18. Perry had gone professional in order to earn more than the £10 prize for winning Wimbledon, but even though he was eventually paid thousands of pounds, the millions earned by Murray and other top tennis players were far out of reach. 1936: Piccadilly Circus was already a maze of cars even though few normal people would have owned one . Leaders: Stanley Baldwin, left, was the British Prime Minister, while Adolf Hitler's power was growing . It was not just the economics of the game that were different in the 1930s - the equipment used by players bore almost no similarities to that of today. Perry used a Slazenger racket made from wood and strung with sheep's gut, while Murray's is a top-of-the-range carbon-fibre model designed to maximise speed. Should Andy Murray be given a knighthood for winning Wimbledon? The wooden racket was a lot smaller, at 65 sq in compared to 98, but nonetheless weighed more - up to 400g, compared to less than 300g for modern rackets. Tennis balls were much softer then, as they were covered in pure wool, whereas now they are made from vulcanised rubber which is engineered to bounce in a particular way. It is easy to assume that modern-day athletes put a lot more preparation into their game than in the amateur era, but in fact Perry helped pioneer the intense training which now characterises professional sport. He upended the aristocratic . assumption that tennis should be a contest of skill rather than power, . and spent much of his time upping his fitness levels so he could outlast . his opponents on the court. Mourning: King George V's funeral procession passes through Norfolk following his death in January 1936 . Some things never change: Shoppers flood the streets of London to take advantage of the 1936 sales . Perry . trained with Arsenal almost every day, and played in friendly matches . for the club, giving him a more strenuous physical routine than other . players of the time. But . in some areas the 1930s game had some way to go in understanding the . importance of physical condition - Perry loved chocolate and sweets, and . could constantly be seen smoking a pipe. The champion would surely be . aghast at Murray's favourite post-game snack - a plate of sushi. And . Perry, like all players of the time, wore long trousers and baggy . shirts, paying little heed to the aerodynamic or cooling qualities of . athletic clothing. One . link between Murray and Perry was broken in 2009 when the Scottish star . stopped wearing kit made by Fred Perry, the brand founded in 1952 to . cash in on the champion's fame. Asked what he though Perry might say to him ahead of the final, Murray quipped that would ask, 'Why are you not wearing my kit?' However, . Perry's son David said: 'I think my father would be proud that finally . someone's come along who's good enough to take a shot at it.' Landmark: Butlin's holiday camp was founded at Skegness in 1936 . Beyond the sporting world, the Britain of 1936 was very different to the country today. Whereas . now we are troubled by economic decline, the rise of China and rapid . technological change, back then the shadow of fascism lay over Europe. In . 1936 Hitler reoccupied the Rhineland, in direct contravention of the . Treaty of Versailles, signalling the aggressive attitude that would lead . to the outbreak of the Second World War three years later. Loaf of bread: then 4½p, now £1.32 . Pint of beer: then 14p, now £3.25 . Cinema ticket: then 10p, now £6.40 . Average home: then £550, now £240,000 . Notwithstanding Perry's Wimbledon victory, the biggest sporting event of the year was the Berlin Olympics - themselves tainted by fascist politics as athletes were encouraged to salute Hitler and the Nazi swastika. The Prime Minister, then as now, was a Conservative at the head of a coalition - Stanley Baldwin was leading the National Government which would last until the appointment of the wartime cabinet under Churchill in 1940. Politics in Britain was dominated by the abdication crisis which followed the death of George V - his eldest son Edward took the throne in January but relinquished it in December in order to marry his mistress, American divorcee Wallis Simpson, leaving his brother to be crowned as George VI. It was also a year of considerable technological advances, as the BBC launched the first electronic television broadcasts, the Hoover Dam was completed in America, the speaking clock telephone service was introduced and Volkswagen began producing their first cars. Another important part of British life to date back to 1936 is the holiday camp - Billy Butlin opened his first establishment at Skegness, with the 35-shilling weekly price making it affordable to working families for the first time.","Fred Perry won Wimbledon three times before turning professional in 1936 .

Out after scandal: Huma Abedin was seen going to work meetings the day after she made a joint press conference with her husband Anthony Weiner . Huma Abedin has sparked further controversy with the revelation that she was employed by private companies at the same time as working for the State Department. For the first time this week Abedin is being questioned over something unrelated to her decision to stand by her husband Anthony Weiner during his latest sexting scandal. Abedin has spent almost 20 years working for Hillary Clinton, first while her husband Bill was President and then most recently when she was running the State Department. After Abedin gave birth to her son Jordan, she returned to Clinton's side in the State Department in June 2012 but her title changed from deputy chief of staff to 'special government employee'. The New York Times reported that little changed about Abedin's actual role in affair of state, but she also began consulting for private firms. Her expertise came for a price, as Fox News is reporting that Teneo paid her $355,000, which is well over double her $135,000 salary from the State Department. She and her husband reported earning $496,000 that year, with Weiner's contributions coming from the consulting business he quietly opened before making his bid for a new political life. Now one Senator is calling for Abedin to explain what inside knowledge, if any, she brought to the public sector from her dealings in the State Department . 'I am concerned that the 'special government employee' designation blurs the line between public and private sector employees, especially when employees receive full-time salaries for what appears to be part-time work,' Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa wrote in a letter to Abedin and sitting Secretary of State John Kerry. On the side: Abedin reportedly made $355,000 from her consulting work that happened as she worked for Hillary Clinton when the former First Lady was Secretary of State . Supportive: In 2012, after her husband Anthony Weiner resigned from Congress, Abedin earned $135,000 from the State Department and $355,000 from her consulting work . In response, Abedin said that the move was approved by State Department lawyers. She wrote back to the Republican Senator saying she 'was not asked, nor did I provide, insights about the Department, my work with the Secretary, or any government information to which I may have had access'. The discrepancy between her work for the government and the private sector first appeared in May as Weiner began to plot his campaign to become New York City's next mayor. She did not disclose her work with Teneo as part of her financial report, which is a standard filing for government employees in order to make known any possible conflicts of interest. Close connections: One Republican Senator is now calling for clarification as he fears she may have used classified information to help Teneo financially . No more: Mrs Abedin, seen here telling a coffee server to move during a conference in San Francisco, has worked for Mrs Clinton in various capacity since 1996 . Though officials are generally expected to report any sources of income, Clinton's longtime spokesman Philippe Reines said she did not have to do so. Her close work with Mrs Clinton has carried on past the State Department and Abedin was said to have gone on a call with the former Secretary an hour after she gave her joint press conference with her husband on Tuesday where she said she was aware that he continued sexting women well after he resigned from Congress.","Weiner's wife was given a special title that allowed her to work for the State Department while earning hundreds of thousands from private firms .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 08:25 EST, 7 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:25 EST, 7 July 2013 . Announcement: Theresa May, pictured appearing on television today, will reveal plans to recover powers from the EU in a speech this week . Britain is set to claw back 100 powers from the EU as the Government seeks an opt-out from controversial policies such as the European Arrest warrant. The move represent the start of David Cameron's attempt to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Europe ahead of the proposed in-out referendum on the EU. But it is also a coup for Home Secretary Theresa May, who will announce the plans this week and is likely to receive a boost to her profile after successfully deporting hate preacher Abu Qatada. There are currently 133 EU regulations governing home affairs, justice and the police, including measures to set up a European DNA database and impose driving bans which are valid across the continent. In the next few days, Mrs May will tell MPs that the UK is to withdraw from all of the regulations before opting back in to some of them, according to the Sunday Telegraph. The process of opting out is governed by the controversial Lisbon Treaty, which states that member nations can exempt themselves from whole areas of EU policy. The British Government is set to examine each measure in turn to determine whether or not it is in the national interest to sign up. It is expected that roughly two thirds of the 133 rules will be ditched by ministers next year. One of the most contentious EU justice measures is the European Arrest Warrant, which allows any country to demand the arrest and deportation of a suspected criminal by another member state. It is designed to stop offenders seeking refuge abroad, but British officials claim that slacker standards in other countries leave the system open to abuse and endanger UK citizens accused of crimes. Britain deports far more suspects under . the EAW than it receives, and there are concerns over the way that some . countries hold suspects for months without putting them on trial.

Senior Conservatives are also keen to withdraw from a Europe-wide database of fingerprints and DNA profiles, and a plan to appoint a public prosecutor with the ability to investigate alleged wrongdoing in any member state. The announcement of the new opt-outs is part of a plan to pacify Eurosceptic Tory back-benchers, who accuse Mr Cameron of being overly concerned with pleasing his Liberal Democrat coalition partners. The Prime Minister has pledged to hold a referendum on whether or not to stay in the EU if the Conservatives win a majority at the next Election. A call to enshrine the referendum promise into law was passed unanimously by MPs this week, with 304 in favour and none voting against. Victory: Mrs May is riding high after the successful deportation of Muslim hate cleric Abu Qatada . The main beneficiary of the move to reclaim EU powers may be Mrs May, who is widely believed to hold leadership ambitions. She is riding high after the deportation of Abu Qatada, who was flown to Jordan early this morning after a 10-year legal battle costing taxpayers as much as £2million. The latest announcement will entrench her reputation as the darling of the Right, and the main rival to other leadership contenders such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.

The island has been uninhabited for over a century, although the current owners - the Chettle family from England, who bought it in 2003 - used it for holidays and summer camping. But the new owners will not have to make do with life underground or under canvas. A ruined croft, which was once home to ten islanders, has planning permission for a new home that will provide spectacular views of the island's surroundings. Mark Mitchell, head of selling agents Bell Ingram, said: 'An area of land with as much history and beauty as the Island of Wiay does not come up on the market very often. 'It has a fantastic back story, once being the hidey-hole for Bonnie Prince Charlie, which is paralleled by the stunning views of the surrounding Benbecula and South Uist islands, making it the ideal location for those looking to totally escape the rat race.' The 970-acre island also has sporting rights, and in recent years the land has been used for woodcock and duck shooting. There is also red deer stalking and fishing. The 970-acre island also has sporting rights, and in recent years the land has been used for woodcock and duck shooting. There is also red deer stalking and fishing . Located half a mile south-east of Benbecula, Wiay is accessed by private boat from Petersport to a sheltered bay close to the ruined cottage on the west side of the island. The island is predominately heather clad, with a small number of freshwater lochs, rising to 335ft at Beinn a'Tuath. But it is best known for playing its part in the escape of the prince following the defeat of his Jacobite forces at Culloden in 1746. In 1745, Charles travelled to the Highlands to raise the Scottish clans in rebellion against the current British monarch - King George II, of the house of Hanover. His plan was to make his father James Stuart, the 'Old Pretender', king. But after Culloden, he fled west and was transported to the Outer Hebrides by boat in an eight-hour voyage in atrocious conditions. He eventually sought shelter in a cave on Wiay, now known as 'Prince Charlie's Rest', while his followers kept watch for the British navy. He was brought fresh clothing and it appears this was the first time the prince wore Highland dress. Wiay from the air. The island has been uninhabited for over a century, although the current owners - the Chettle family from England, who bought it in 2003 - used it for holidays and summer camping . Prince Charles spent the next few weeks in hiding, employing several disguises. He lived like a commoner and ate drammach, a type of oatmeal mixed raw with seawater. The prince eventually obtained passage to France and escaped, pledging to his remaining followers that he would return with an army. Wiay has since slipped back into obscurity. One former resident, William Buie, left the island in 1825 to become a banker in Canada. Although the island was logged as having six inhabitants in 1861, it was deserted by the turn of the 20th century. Meanwhile a series of meetings are taking place on Barra and Vatersay this week for islanders to consider a takeover, which would include all fishing and mineral rights on the 16,000-acre isles. Barra are Vatersay, which are linked by a causeway and have around 1300 inhabitants, are currently under the ownership of the Scottish Government's agriculture department, as a result of a long-standing historical arrangement and after additional land was handed to it in 2003 by former laird Iain MacNeill. Bonnie Prince Charlie eventually sought shelter in this cave on Wiay, now known as 'Prince Charlie's Rest', while his followers kept watch for the British navy . Part of the deal by Mr MacNeill, whose family lines go back more than 1000 years on Barra, was that the estate should be given to islanders free of charge should they decide to vote for ownershup.Residents are now to attend public meetings to investigate whether they want to take this step. They will not only discuss the 9,000 acres donated by Mr MacNeill, who died two years ago, but also the possibility of taking over the remainder of Barra and Vatersay, which has over 400 crofts. The prince eventually obtained passage to France and escaped, pledging to his remaining followers that he would return with an army . This has been under the control of the agircultural department through an historical legacy of the Land Reform uprising a century ago. The debates have been organised by Coimhearsnachd Bharraidh agus Bhatarsaidh - Barra and Vatersay Community. A spokesman for the community-owned company aimed at the future development of the islands, said: 'The whole purpose of the meetings is basically testing the temperature of the water, and seeing what the feeling is locally. 'It is for the community toconsider the pros and cons of a community buyout. This is an important step in the potential development of a land buyout. 'This is a pre-feasability to see what the local mood and perception is.' Local councillor Donald Manford said: 'I am sure the islanders want to take control of their own affairs, although there will still have to be a vote to decide.' Three guest speakers are helping inform the debate and gather local reaction. These include David Cameron, chair of Community Land Scotland which helps support small rural communities in considering taking ownership of public land. Also taking part is Murdo MacKay, director of the West Harris Trust which recently won a Lottery grant of £380,000 to help kick start a process of allowing their community to manage their own affairs as they develop plans for affordable housing, a hydro-electric scheme and other economic development projects. Helen MacDougall of HIE Community Assets Branch is also speaking about how they assist communities in the preparation for a bid and offers start-up advice. A community buyout of Barra and Vatersay would be the latest in a long succession throughout the Highlands and Islands. Only last month, residents on the small island of Scalpay, off Harris, voted to take over the running of their own affairs.","Wiay, off the coast of South Uist, has been put up for sale for £500,000 .

Former pro footballer Aveion Cason Sr. had a long record on the field, but a less impressive record as a father and the former running back went on Oprah’s OWN Network with the goal of patching things up with his estranged son. Cason, who grew up fatherless himself, ended up continuing the cycle when he abandoned his young son Aveion Jr. Cason recently came back into his son’s life. And the slew of emotions that go along with such a reunion played out in front of television cameras courtesy of Oprah’s OWN Network. Amends: On an emotional episode of Oprah's Life Class, former pro-footballer Aveion Cason makes amends with his 13-year-old son after a 10-year estrangement . On Oprah’s Life Class with Iyanla Vanzant, Vanzant takes a head-on approach to patching up familial rifts. ‘I grew up without a father,’ said the elder Cason. ‘I feel resentment with my father coming up because he's never been around, and when I talk to my son, I feel like he feels the same way.’ For about ten years, Aveion Jr. didn’t see his father. Now 13, he mirrors his father’s resentment. ‘It felt horrible that you left me,’ Aveion Jr. says as Vanzant coaches him on. ‘It made me feel like I was a mistake... I loved the person, but I never see him.’ Like her OWN: Oprah helped facilitate the confrontation between Cason and his son Aveion Jr. as part of her Oprah's Life Class on the OWN Network . Aveion Jr.’s mother stands by as the two men try to come to terms with their estrangement. ‘I think I was a mistake,’ Aveion Jr. said as tears rolled down his young cheeks and his father shook his head in the foreground. ‘And that made you feel what,’ Iyanla asked. ‘Like I wasn't supposed to be here.’ ‘What do you want to tell [him] now that he's back,’ Vanzant continued probing the boy. ‘That I love him...’ replied Aveion Jr., then with a little goading from Vanzant he commands his father, ‘You don’t get to leave me again!’ Final: Alongside his mother and a studio audience of Oprah fans, Aveion Jr, 13, told his father 'You don't get to leave me again!' Cason is clear in his intentions to be a present father to the younger Aveion. On his Twitter account, on which a photo of the former pro baller alongside Oprah Winfrey now serves as his profile picture, Cason describes himself thusly: . ‘Florida made, but live in Dallas. God fearing and loving father. Im blessed and will always give 100% till da day my heart stop!

"By . Jack Doyle and Chris Brooke . PUBLISHED: . 17:10 EST, 5 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:44 EST, 5 August 2013 . Councils are using millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to hire private detectives for  snooping operations. Dozens of town halls, several quangos and even one central government department used the investigators to check on both members of the public and their own staff. Officials spent nearly £4million in two years on covert surveillance, background checks and other intrusive investigations by private eyes. Tracked: 999 call centre worker Anthea Orchard, from Halifax was put under investigation by West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Services who suspected her of moonlighting while on sick leave . The startling scale of the use of private eyes by state bodies came as it emerged investigators employed by a fire brigade fitted a GPS tracking device to the family car of a 999 call centre worker. Anthea Orchard, 35, was put under investigation by West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Services who suspected her of moonlighting while on sick leave. The private eyes they employed telephoned her with fake offers of work in an effort to lure her into a confession – but were rumbled when she traced their telephone number on the internet. Mrs Orchard – who insists she has done nothing wrong and was not working illicitly – was also tipped off by neighbours who saw investigators acting suspiciously outside her Bradford home. She has now left her job with an £11,000 . payoff after agreeing not to sue the fire authority for ‘unnecessary . surveillance’ and intrusion into her private life. Critics said the case . exposed the worrying extent of state snooping by unregulated private . investigators (PIs). Concerned: Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, who has conducted an inquiry into PIs, says their use is becoming widespread . In recent weeks the so-called ‘secret’ hacking scandal has revealed how ‘shady’ private eyes employed by blue chip companies, law firms and celebrities hacked, blagged and stole private information. MPs are demanding the publication of a list of 102 firms and private individuals who engaged corrupt private eyes which is being kept secret by the Serious and Organised Crime Agency. There is no suggestion any of those PIs engaged by councils and other public bodies have acted unlawfully. But they show how the private investigation industry has extended its reach deep into the public sector. Lord Justice Leveson was warned about the use of private investigators by councils, law firms and others during his inquiry into the Press, but did not investigate them or mention them in his final report. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, who has conducted an inquiry into PIs, said: ‘I am concerned that the use of PIs seems to be becoming more and more widespread. ‘This is a worrying trend. The Government must put forward its announced regulation for private investigators as a matter of urgency.’ Nick Pickles, director of pressure . group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘Private investigators have been able to . hide in the shadows for too long, even when they’re being paid with . taxpayers’ money. ‘The fact that numerous public bodies . think it is acceptable to use private investigators to snoop on their . own staff should send a chill down the spine. ‘As the lengths that some private investigators will go in their work becomes abundantly clear, there’s a risk of a ‘‘see no evil, hear no evil’’ culture emerging around snooping. ‘Far more could be done to rein in who is allowed to launch surveillance operations and making them responsible for the investigators working on their behalf.’ Freedom of Information requests by Big Brother Watch revealed some £3.9million of taxpayers’ money was spent on private eyes over two years. That included 37 councils, several quangos and the Department for Transport. Among the activities investigated by council-sponsored PIs were fly-tipping, blue badge fraud, fake insurance claims and housing fraud. They were also used to investigate parties in care proceedings. In addition, several councils used PIs to probe fraud allegations against staff accused of stealing from their employer or faking sick leave. The Department for Transport said it had used PIs to probe driving test fraud and fake personal injury claims. The NHS litigation authority used PIs to examine insurance fraud, and the Legal Services Commission for debt collection. The Marine Management Organisation used PIs to conduct ‘fisheries surveillance’. The Food Standards Agency said they were used for an ‘internal discipline investigation’. Laws due to come into force next year will see shady private investigators face jail if they fail to abide by new regulations. All investigators will be registered, forced to pass a national qualification, and undergo background checks before they are granted a licence. Operating without a licence will be a criminal offence punishable with a six-month jail term and a £5,000 fine. Overlooked: Lord Justice Leveson was warned about the use of private investigators by councils, law firms and others during his inquiry into the Press, but did not investigate them or mention them in his final report . Mr Pickles said the use of the tracking device to snoop on Mrs Orchard was a ‘staggeringly heavy-handed and intrusive response’. The mother of two, who lives with construction manager husband Gareth, 37, and children Ashleigh, five, and Haydn, two, returned to work last October after taking maternity leave. While off she had started a part-time balloon decorating business. Shortly afterwards, she was off sick with stress and began to receive suspicious calls from would-be customers asking her to take on work. She checked her Audi A6 car and found a GPS tracking device had been fitted underneath. She said: ‘I have never felt as scared in my life, I couldn’t go out, couldn’t do my shopping. It stopped me doing anything.’ The emergency call handler was given a letter informing her she was under investigation. On October 31 she was signed off sick due to stress, depression and a recently diagnosed condition, hypothyroidism, which can cause symptoms such as tiredness, weight gain and aches. ‘As soon as I booked sick, I refrained from work. My husband took over the reins of the simple stuff but I didn’t work with the balloons. I took the website down and didn’t think of doing any more.’ Within days she began receiving ‘funny phone calls’ trying to get her to take on work. But searching the internet for the number brought up the private investigator. She then found the tracker device which was attached by magnets and fitted with a SIM card to allow her every movement to be monitored. ‘This is an infringement into my family life,’ she said. ‘The whole situation has made me very ill. It is not right that public money is being used in this way. It was horrible to think someone was watching us.’ Mrs Orchard, who is now working full-time on her balloon business, added: ‘I haven’t been a mum during all this. It has affected the whole family. I’ve lost what was basically a £30,000-a-year career.’ She said the private detective agency was Nottingham-based Riding Commercial Investigations, operating under the internet name ‘localpi’. The West Yorkshire fire service refused to comment. Sinister: The tracking device was left on the . back of Mrs Orchard's Audi while she was off sick. Their use by PIs . falls under a very grey area of the law . Putting a GPS tracking device on someone’s car to monitor their movements sounds like something out of a Hollywood film or an episode of Spooks. But covert surveillance techniques such as these are far from the exclusive preserve of spies and police detectives. Councils and other public bodies can use them to follow both the public and their staff if they suspect them of wrongdoing. And their use by unregulated private eyes also falls into a very grey area of the law. If surveillance of the public is ordered by the state, it will be covered by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) which gave councils the right to carry out snooping operations. This led to examples such as councils tracking parents to see if they were lying about which school catchment area they lived in. Recent changes to the law mean town halls must get permission from a magistrate. But it appears many cases of state snooping, including that of 999 call operator Anthea Orchard, fall outside this law. RIPA applies only to the actions of councils and other bodies when they are performing their core public functions – such as a fire authority combating bogus 999 calls. But the surveillance on Mrs Orchard related to her status as an employee. As a result, the law which applies in the case is the Data Protection Act. It allows snooping for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime. It also requires that monitoring is not undertaken for minor reasons – and requires intelligence or evidence before it can be conducted. In accepting a payout, Mrs Orchard has foregone any legal recourse. Had she not she could have sued for breach of privacy, and the fire authority would have had to justify the level of surveillance and the methods it used.","Public bodies spent nearly £4million on investigators over two years .

Pupils . at Marlborough College, where the Duchess of Cambridge was taught, are . offered trout-fishing lessons on the stretch of Kennet which flows . through the grounds. Campaigners . from the Action for the River Kennet group say they first became . alarmed last month by the increasingly murky state of the  water. ARK director Charlotte Hitchmough said: 'The water had been a funny colour for a long time, caused by an algal bloom, and we were watching it carefully as it was a cause for concern. 'Then suddenly on Sunday, the water went clear. At first we were very pleased but then we tested the water and found that all the invertebrates - the bugs that the fish and birds eat - had disappeared.' She said the issue is on a 10-mile stretch of the river downstream from a sewage treatment works. Ms Hitchmough said: 'Those little bugs at the bottom of the river are so important. It would be like killing all the grass in a field so the cows had nothing to eat. 'At the moment we don't know where this pollution has come from.' A spokesman for the Environment . Agency, which launched an investigation on Tuesday, said: 'The pollution . has now stopped and we are investigating the cause and the source of . the pollutant. 'Environment officers have taken soil samples and ecology samples to help us identify the source.' Environment Agency said there was a 'serious pollution' incident on the river between Malborough and Hungerford . The Environment Agency said officers have been investigating the source of the pollution, believed to be chlorpyrifos, a common agricultural pesticide, and have been taking samples to assess the impact on the water quality. 'Investigations have shown that many macro-invertebrates have been killed, but there have been no reports so far of any fish killed,' the agency said in a statement yesterday. Public Health England, working in partnership with the Environment Agency and Wiltshire and West Berkshire Councils, has advised the public to avoid skin contact with the water in the river until the exact concentrations and impacts of the pesticide have been determined. People are also being advised not to fish or to eat any fish caught in the affected stretch of the river until there is more information about exactly what has caused the pollution. Martin Salter MP, the Angling Trust's campaigns coordinator, said: 'We want to know why on earth a lethal chemical like chlorpyriphos is allowed to be used anywhere near a river or watercourse. 'Apparently the 15km wipe out of invertebrates between Marlborough and Hungerford may have been caused by as little as a couple of spoonfuls of the stuff. If this is the case then the sooner we follow the lead of Singapore and America and ban it the better.'","Environment Agency said people should not touch River Kennet water .

Ed Miliband must win an ‘ideological battle’ with his union paymasters to avoid political oblivion, Lord Reid warned yesterday. The former home secretary said Unite leader Len McCluskey wanted to take Labour ‘back to the 80s’ – and that Mr Miliband must move swiftly to make sure the party survives. A senior ally of David Miliband – who lost out on the party leadership due to Ed’s union support – joined the call for ‘decisive action’, stressing that Mr Miliband’s ‘credibility’ is at stake. Tomorrow, the Labour leader will outline plans to change his party’s rules and limit the power of the unions. The speech comes after Unite was accused of trying to fix the selection process for Falkirk’s parliamentary candidate to benefit Mr McCluskey’s close friend Karie Murphy. Police have launched a fraud inquiry over claims that people were signed up as Labour party members by Unite – without their knowledge – so they could vote for Miss Murphy. Labour bosses have also received complaints about Unite’s activities in several other constituencies. Now Blairite Lord Reid has said Mr Miliband faces ‘an ideological battle’ with ‘those who want to take Labour back to the 70s and 80s, as Len McCluskey does – when we represented the sectional voice, the weak echo of every industrial demand of the trade unions’. ‘I am in no doubt that the leader of Unite wants to impose an ideological direction on the Labour Party that would lead us into political oblivion,’ he added.

Gone: Tom Watson resigned from the Shadow Cabinet in the wake of the Falkirk scandal . Scandal: The Unite union led by Len McCluskey, left, tried to impose Karie Murphy, right, on the Falkirk seat . He told the Mail: ‘It needs to be a . very, very strong speech. This is about the future of the Labour Party . and whether people will see Ed as a credible prime minister.’ The . frontbencher added: ‘Ed still enjoys a lot of goodwill. People . instinctively want him to succeed. But Tuesday is a very big day in . terms of maintaining that support.’ Mr Miliband’s deputy Harriet Harman . announced yesterday that Labour will cap the amount of money that can be . spent by candidates and their union backers in selection contests. Insiders say Mr Miliband is examining . whether to hold open primary elections – which would let the general . public elect parliamentary candidates – as well as plans to speed up the . selection process, leaving unions less time to mobilise. Warning: John Reid, left, described the fight as an 'ideological battle' while Harriet Harman, left, announced new funding measures to prevent a repeat of Falkirk . He also plans . to make it more difficult for unions to sign up new party members. Demand: Grant Shapps called for Mr Miliband to reveal the unions' continued influence . Leaked Unite documents show it sought to exploit rules that let unions . pay new members’ fees to secure 41 candidacies. Labour has since . scrapped the scheme. Party insiders said concerns have . already been raised about the union’s activities in Chester and . Brighton, Glasgow, Crawley, East Dunbartonshire, Paisley, Garston and . Halewood and Ilford North. Unite has also been accused of plotting to . oust shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said Mr . Miliband should re-run every constituency selection that has taken place . since he became leader. ‘Ed Miliband is admitting that his candidate . selection process and the way the Labour Party is bankrolled by the . union barons is broken,’ he said. ‘He should refuse to take any more . money from the unions until the funding system is fixed. 'If he doesn’t, . then it’s still the same old Labour Party, bankrolled by the union . barons and with a leader who’s not in control.’ Mr McCluskey has urged Mr Miliband to . ‘step back from the brink of a ruinous division’, adding: ‘Don’t let .

Victim: St Louis Mortgage banker and avid golfer Mark Mihal, pictured, was with friends at the Annbriar Golf Course near Waterloo when he suddenly disappeared into the turf on the fairway of the 14th hole . A Missouri father was hoping for a hole-in-one when he set out for a day of golf on Friday - but he didn't think he'd end up the one in the hole. St Louis mortgage banker and avid golfer Mark Mihal was with three friends at the Annbriar Golf Course near Waterloo, Illinois, when he suddenly disappeared into the turf on the fairway of the 14th hole. The 43-year-old fell into a bell-shaped enclosure below the green that measured 15 feet deep and 10 feet wide, surprising his golf pals and the course management who said this was the first time anything like this had happened in Annbriar's 20-year history. 'I noticed this anomaly in the fairway and went to have a look but, by the time I took one step, I was gone, I was underground,' Mihal told MailOnline. 'When I went through (the opening) I couldn't see anything, I didn't know how far I was going or what I was going to hit.' He said, after plummeting through the earth, he landed on a pile of mud in a cavernous space that could have fit up to 10 people. 'I was just lying on the side of the mound,' he said. 'There was some room in there, it was sort of like a room or a cave. It wasn't confining. It was very dark, though after a while my eyes got used to it. But I couldn't look up because there was stuff still falling.' The rescue was precarious as no one knew whether . the hole would expand, swallowing more people. The fact he dislocated his shoulder in the fall didn't help either. 'I knew the only way to get out was straight up and I didn't have the use of my left arm,' he said. Sinkhole: The 43-year-old fell into a bell-shaped enclosure below the green that measured 15 feet deep and 10 feet wide, pictured . Friends: Mihal's friends, pictured, managed to hoist him out of the hole by tying a rope around his waist . His friends - Mike Peters, Ed . Magaletta and Hank Martinez - called the golf course's . pro shop and, armed with a rope and a ladder, general manager Russ Noble . rushed to help out. Magaletta, a local real estate agent with whom Mihal had been playing golf for years, bravely volunteered to climbed down into the enclosure where he tied the rope around his . friend's waist so the team could pull him to safety. 'Ed came down to get me. He made a . sling out of his jacket and tied a rope around me, which the others used . to pull me from the top and he pushed me from underneath,' Mihal said. The whole rescue took just 20 minutes, but the father said, during the terrifying ordeal, he couldn't help but . think of the sinkhole that two weeks ago swallowed 36-year-old . Florida man Jeffrey Bush, who remains missing. 'That crossed my mind when I was actually falling. Is this how I'm going to go out? In a sinkhole,' Mihal told MailOnline. 14th: The sinkhole opened up as Mihal was standing on the fairway, pictured, of the 14th hole . He said he was pretty eager to get out as soon as possible, fearing the ground beneath him would continue to sink. 'I . felt quite stable on the mud, but when I looked around me there were . some cracks where there was just blackness so I think (the hole) was . just going to keep going,' he said. Mihal pushed the thoughts of February's deadly sinkhole out of his mind and focused on how he was going to get out with his left arm out of order. He also thought about how fortunate he was not to have been golfing alone that day. 'If you're playing by yourself and . waiting for someone to find you you'd be waiting a long time,' he said.' Fortunately, it wasn't an elderly person or someone on their own. Or an entire golf cart. We were told to park the carts off the ground that day.' Mihal added: 'Maybe I'm lucky and unlucky,' referring to having his friends on hand to help. While . he never would have suspected a 15ft sinkhole on the course, Mihal, who had played . at Annbriar more than 10 times in the past, said he did notice . something odd on the 14th hole fairway before he dropped through the . earth. Avid golfer: Mihal, pictured on another course, is an avid golfer but says he will probably not play at Annbriar again . Scene: The sinkhole opened up on the fairway of the 14th hole, circled, on Annbriar Golf Course .

'I noticed this . anomaly in the fairway, it was a bathtub size depression, and I thought . to myself ""that is unfair to have that there,"" he said. 'It didn't look unstable, I was just thinking how would you play a shot from there.' Recovering: Mihal, pictured, is undergoing medical tests to make sure the dislocated shoulder is the only injury he came out of the hole with . Mihal . is undergoing medical tests to make sure the dislocated shoulder is the . only injury he came out of the hole with. He had an MRI today to . determine whether the arm requires surgery. The . health scare is quite enough for 43-year-old's family, who have been . supporting his wife, Lori, through chemotherapy for breast cancer. Lori wrote an account of her husband's sinkhole survival on a golfing website Mihal co-owns,  golfmanna.com. 'He was having a great round and lots of laughs with his buddies,' she wrote. 'Mark had already hit his second shot when he went to check out the distance for his playing partner, Mike Peters, who was getting ready to hit. Mike had his back to Mark and when he turned to say something to him, Mark was gone.' Lori said Mihal is claustrophobic and began to panic when he realized his predicament and his injury meant he was in excruciating pain. 'The clubhouse respondents brought a 12-foot ladder, which they put down the side of the hole and propped on a mound of mud within it,' she wrote. 'However, Mark was another six feet below that level and had dislocated his shoulder during the fall; he only had the use of one arm and couldn’t pull himself up to the ladder.' Lori said Peters called her once Mihal was out of the hole and in an ambulance on his way to hospital. Unbelievable: Mark Mihal's wife, Lori, pictured right, said the whole story was 'unbelievable' 'As soon as I answered, I asked ""What . is wrong?"" she recalled. 'He said, ""Mark is fine, but he has had an . accident and is in an ambulance."" I don't think he knew how to tell me . that my husband had just been swallowed by the earth. It just sounds too . unbelievable!' She said when her husband told the story of what had happened she was 'dumbfounded.' 'I immediately thanked God that they were able to get him out; I, too, couldn't help but think of the recent news buzz about sinkholes and people being lost forever.' She said the bizarre incident reminds her of the movie Space Jam in which Michael Jordan disappears into the ground while playing golf. 'We're very fortunate that Mark wasn't injured worse than he was – or even killed,' she said. 'It's just another reminder to hold your loved ones close and thank God for all the blessings we've been given.' Geologist . Philip Moss said sinkholes are common around St Louis because the limestone . bedrock often dissolves in rainwater creating a cave below the surface. But he told the St Louis Post-Dispatch the openings are generally visible. 'This guy just really was in the wrong place at the wrong time,' Moss said. Mihal said the Annbriar course had been one of his favorites and he and his golf pals - the Friday Foursome - have enjoyed playing it for years. 'It's one of the better, if not the best public course in the area,' he said. But while he's sure to continue his golfing hobby after his shoulder recovers, Mihal will be giving that particular green a wide berth. 'I think its just a little too weird,' he said. 'I don't think I'd be very comfortable playing that hole again.' Sinkhole graphic . A sinkhole is a hole that opens . up suddenly in the ground. They mostly occur because of erosion or . underground water that gathers naturally or due to man-made activities. When . this water dissolves the foundation beneath the surface layer, spaces . and caverns develop underground. Limestone, carbonate rock, . and salt beds are particular vulnerable to this erosion. Meanwhile, . the top layer of Earth usually stays intact. When the dissolving area . beneath the surface becomes too large, the surface suddenly gives way. While they often . occur from natural causes, sinkholes can be man-made and caused by . human activity. Groundwater pumping and construction are the most likely . culprits. They can also occur when water drainage systems are changed. According . to the U.S. Geological Survey, Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, . Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by . sinkholes. But sinkholes are also common in the St. Louis region where the bedrock here is limestone. Geologist Philip Moss told the Post-Dispatch that limestone can dissolve in rainwater to make an opening known as a 'conduit.' New openings usually reveal themselves during or immediately after a heavy downpour. 'It's a gradual process that creates a void in the soil,' Moss told the newspaper. 'Over time, (the void) migrates upward through the soil to where the soil arch gets too thin to support the weight of what's over it, and it collapses.'

It is not every day that George Osborne is described as being Churchillian. But the Chancellor’s insistence that ‘We are all in this together’ when talking about the spending cuts echoes a phrase used by Sir Winston Churchill at a private dinner more than 50 years ago. The wartime Prime Minister said ‘We’re all in it together’ in  a speech to tax collectors and former Chancellors of the Exchequer about the economic and political threats facing Britain in the 1950s. Until now historians had no idea that Churchill had ever made the remark. But a sound recording of the speech, which was made on May 28, 1952, has been found among the politician’s private record collection – currently being digitised by experts at the Churchill Archive at the University of Cambridge. The recording, which was played for the first time on BBC Radio 4 programme Churchill’s Secret Cabinet last night, is one of several Churchill had privately commissioned for his own benefit. In many instances they are the only surviving public record of his attendance at private events. Historian and Churchill biographer Andrew Roberts said: ‘Both George Osborne and David Cameron have used a near identical phrase and they are being Churchillian without actually realising it. ‘Of course they were both unaware that Churchill had  ever said it.’ Churchill, who kept his record collection in a mahogany cabinet in the dining room of his Chartwell home, shared his concerns about Britain’s future  at a Jubilee dinner organised by the National Association of Her Majesty’s Inspector of Taxes. Favourite phrase: Chancellor George Osborne is being unwittingly Churchillian every time he uses his mantra . He said: ‘I feel a great burden upon me at my age having seen so much and been through so much. ‘Not that I cannot bear it in the ordinary physical sense but I do see great perils hanging over the country. We have all got to fight together for the life of the nation...Our feeling is to some extent alleviated by the fact that we’re all in it together.’ Experts say the fact the Prime Minister was so open about his feelings might mean the speech was impromptu. Churchill becomes more light-hearted as the speech progresses, paying tribute to members of the audience. He says the country owes them a debt of gratitude and thanks them for their help ‘in extracting more and more money from those who guilelessly voted us into office’. Nearly identical: David Cameron is also famous for using the phrase in this time of austerity . He jokes about his last visit to the association some 25 years earlier, when he was ‘only’ Chancellor of the Exchequer and Second Lord of the Treasury, compared with his new positions as Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury. Mr Roberts said it was ‘extraordinary’ to learn new things about Churchill, who died in 1965. The record collection also includes a previously unheard recording of a speech Churchill made to RAF personnel at Biggin Hill in 1951. He recalls how he crashed while taking flying lessons in the years leading up to the First World War. He says that his dinner companion on that night thought he looked like ‘a ghost’, before telling the officers: ‘I suspect you’ve had many more exciting adventures than that.’ There is also a recording of Churchill explaining to the French people his decision to sink the country’s fleet in July 1940 in a bid to stop it falling into enemy hands. He speaks in the schoolboy French he learnt at Harrow. Mr Roberts believes that Churchill kept recordings of his speeches so he could study them to improve his technique. But the collection also includes a number of musical and comedy works, including Noel Coward’s Don’t Let’s Be Beastly To The Germans as well as songs by music hall acts. Experts at the Churchill Archive are racing against time to digitise the recordings, which are in a poor state and on the verge of collapse.","Until now historians had no idea that Churchill had ever made the remark .

Europe minister David Lidington has become the latest senior figure to land a blow against the High Speed 2 rail link. The Tory MP, whose Aylesbury constituency in Buckinghamshire will be affected by the line, joined the chorus of opposition to HS2 – though as a minister he is duty bound to back the scheme. He raised fears over the spiralling cost – now at £42.6billion – and noise of the trains. In a letter to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Mr Lidington came close to calling for the project to be scrapped after its budget soared by £10 billion. Objections: Europe minister David Lidington is worried about the spiralling cost of the HS2 project . He wrote that constituents had told him this rise ‘gives them no confidence that the final figure will [not] be significantly higher and in the current economic climate that cannot be justified’. Voters believed HS2 should be cancelled and the money spent on other infrastructure projects, he added. Mr Lidington also cast doubt on the level of noise those living along the HS2 line would have to endure. In a letter to Alison Munro, HS2’s chief executive, he said the study measuring average noise levels had included the period between midnight and 5am, when no trains run. This had led to ‘very serious underestimates of what my constituents are likely to experience between 11pm and midnight and 5am and 7am’, he said. Mr Lidington has been criticised by some constituents for not backing a rebel attempt to scupper paving legislation for HS2. High speed: Mr Lidington is also worried about late night and early morning noise from the line affecting his Buckinghamshire constituents . But he made clear resigning was a ‘nuclear’ option. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is said to be ‘not a fan’ of the project and former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan has labelled the scheme a ‘boys’ toy’. The Government insists HS2 will boost the economy in the North and that scrapping it would cost close to 100,000 jobs. The first stage, between London and Birmingham, will start in 2017 and finish in 2026. The second stage, to Manchester and Leeds, should be completed by 2033.","David Lidington is concerned noise will affect his Aylesbury constituents .

The school-wide event May 1 at Queen Creek High School, just outside Phoenix, AZ, was designed to satirize a reality TV show called 'Duck Dynasty,' school officials said, but what started as a way to motivate students to attend the prom ended up outraging minorities around the country, prompting the US Department of Education to open an investigation. Federal investigators will be investigating the extent of the hostilities created in the school by the ill-advised festival. Anger: Queen Creek High School, pictured, has sparked outrage from civil rights leaders after it held a 'Redneck Day' for students . The investigation will look into 'whether a racially hostile environment was created due to language and actions that were not protected by the First Amendment,' a letter from the DOE to the Reverend Jarrett Maupin II, who filed a complaint over the controversial celebration. One student wore a large Confederate flag to school, which he is allowed to do under his First Amendment rights, but was asked to take it off and did, according to the letter. 'The display of the Confederate flag concerns rights protected by the First Amendment,' the letter continued. Seemingly pleased with the impending investigation, Rev. Maupin said the DOE will 'determine the remedy, including moderating conversations between school administrators and civil rights community leaders to shape new policy and racism prevention measures.'

The only intent of 'Redneck Day' was to spoof the characters on the reality show, which follows a family of duck hunters in Louisiana, Tom Lindsey, the superintendent of the Queen Creek Unified School District, told the paper. He said the student wearing the Confederate flag wasn't from Arizona and didn't appreciate the reaction the flag would receive.

It adds that there is a Koranic reference to the medicinal properties of the liquid produced by bees, and that Charlemagne (742-814), the first Holy Roman Emperor, is said to have been treated with bee stings. In the West bee stings have also been used by sufferers of multiple sclerosis (MS), an often disabling disease that attacks the central nervous system.

Dr Sanjay Gupta was opposed to the medicinal use of cannabis but says that he has changed his mind . A leading U.S. doctor who was opposed to the medicinal use of cannabis says that he has changed his mind after investigating medical marijuana further. Dr Sanjay Gupta travelled the world interviewing weed experts, producers and patients, while making a documentary called ‘Weed’. He says that before he started the project, he was ‘unimpressed’ by the scientific literature on medical marijuana. However, he says that he now wants to apologise for holding this opinion, CNN reports. Dr Gupta says he believes that he had not previously considered all of the arguments and that, now that he has, he has changed him mind on the topic. Dr Gupta says that his research has led him to believe that marijuana does have important medicinal properties and that medicinal marijuana use does not come with a high potential for abuse – both things that are denied by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. He draws on the example of a girl called Charlotte Figi, from Colorado, who was having 300 seizures a week when she was three. Charlotte took seven different drugs every day but they failed to stop the seizures. Then she started taking medicinal marijuana, and her brain was calmed sufficiently that she now only has two or three fits a month. Dr Gupta says that meeting people like Charlotte has made him realised that it is ‘irresponsible’ not to provide marijuana as a medicine. He wrote for CNN: ‘It is irresponsible not to provide the best care we can as a medical community, care that could involve marijuana. ‘We have been terribly and systematically misled for nearly 70 years in the United States, and I apologise for my own role in that.’ Dr Gupta says that marijuana has been classed as a ‘schedule one’ drug in the U.S. since 1970 and that this is only the case because there was not sufficient evidence to suggest that it was safe. He argues that it was not banned because of medical evidence, but because of the lack of it. Dr Gupta says that his research has led him to believe that marijuana does have important medicinal properties and that medicinal marijuana use does not come with a high potential for abuse . Dr Gupta claims that there is little evidence to suggest that the potential for abuse is a reason to ban it. He explained that 30 per cent of people who smoke become addicted to tobacco, which is legal, while only 10 per cent of marijuana users become addicted. He went on to say that medical marijuana should not be banned because of its withdrawal symptoms because they are not nearly as severe as the withdrawal symptoms that alcoholics can experience, as these can be life threatening. Dr Gupta does, however, say that he has one concern about cannabis. He worries that young people’s developing brains can be harmed by it – with regularly use during the teenage years causing a decrease in IQ and even, possibly, psychosis. Dr Gupta says that marijuana has been classed as a 'schedule one' drug in the U.S. since 1970 and that this is only the case because there was not sufficient evidence to suggest that it was safe . For this reason, he says that he would not let his own children take marijuana until they were adults. Dr Gupta believes that only about six per cent of studies into weed in the U.S. look at the benefits of the drug, while the rest investigate the dangers of it. As a result, he believes that the evidence is unfairly skewed towards the view that the drug is harmful. He believes that it is too difficult for scientists to study the effects of marijuana as it is hard to access the drug, and hard to get approval for the research. He goes on to say that in the U.S. someone dies from a prescription drug overdose every 19 minute,s while he was unable to find a single example of someone dying from a cannabis overdose.","Dr Sanjay Gupta interviewed cannabis experts, producers and patients .

Poking it's pink bald head out of its mother's pouch, this tiny baby tree kangaroo got its first ever glimpse of the world. The endangered Matschie tree kangaroo, from New Guinea, was quickly reassured by its mother as she leaned forward to lick it. The hairless joey is confined to the pouch where it  will continue to develop for several months before venturing away from its mother. First meeting: This is the moment a mother saw her baby for the first time, as the tiny Matschie tree kangaroo poked its bald head out from the pouch . Though it is only just getting its first view of the world, this joey is believed to have been born around five months ago. As with most marsupials, tree kangaroos are born in an almost embryonic state after a pregnancy of about 44 days. The newborn is only the size of a jelly bean and slowly crawls into the mother's pouch where it locks onto a nipple and then the majority of development takes place. Even once it is big and strong enough to venture out from its mother's pouch, the little joey will continue to clamber back in to rest and sleep and will not be totally weaned until it is around a year old. Home: The hairless joey is confined to the pouch where it will continue to develop for several months before venturing away from its mother - not be totally weaned until it is around a year old . The rare baby tree kangaroo has been bred in captivity at Zoo Miami. It is the first baby for the three-year-old mother . The first-time mother is three-years old and is on loan from the Gladys Porter Zoo in Texas and the five year old father is on loan from the Bronx Zoo in New York. As part of the breeding loan agreement, the female offspring belongs to the Gladys Porter Zoo and will eventually become part of an international captive breeding programme. Zoo Miami has been a long time contributor to Matschie tree kangaroo conservation efforts in the wilds of New Guinea. Matschie tree kangaroos live at high elevations in the Huon Peninsula of Papua New Guinea where they spend most of their time up in trees feeding on a variety of leaves, ferns, moss, and bark. The mother is on loan from the Gladys Porter Zoo, in Texas, and the five-year-old father is on loan from the Bronx Zoo in New York . They are believed to be solitary animals and the only strong social bond formed is between a mother and her offspring. This new mother and her joey will remain off exhibit for several weeks to allow for proper bonding and to help facilitate a smooth introduction for this wonderful new addition.","The endangered Matschie tree kangaroo was born around five months ago .

From a transsexual Mona Lisa to a nude scratching her itchy armpit, these paintings are so bad they are good. Once destined for the trash, they were saved by a lover of odd paintings and are now on display to thousands of visitors a year at a museum dedicated to the worst art in the world. The Museum of Bad Art in Boston, Massachusetts, has now grown to three galleries and houses a collection of 600 terrible pieces. Scroll down for video . Jewel in the crown: Lucy In The Sky With Flowers was the inspiration for the Museum of Bad Art after founder Scott Wilson discovered it in the rubbish and realised it was so bad it was good . Museum favourites: The so-called Mana Lisa, a cross-gender interpretation of the daVinci classic (left) and a blonde woman painted on a blue background (right) From the slightly odd to the downright awful, the collection now receives hundreds of submissions from budding bad artists every month - but only the very worst are hung on the gallery's walls. The museum is the only one on the U.S. dedicated to seriously awful art. Louise Reilly Sacco, executive director of the museum, said: 'Our curators receive at least 20 submissions every month - but only about four or five make it into our collection. 'The museum only accepts artwork that is sincere and original. 'We . look for pieces in which something has gone wrong - it can be the work . of a skilled artist who was trying something new or made an unfortunate . decision. 'Or it can be created by an artist who barely knows which end of the brush to hold. Bizarre: A woman in a bikini stands unfazed stands in flames and this painting of a smiling woman gives her 'an air of frumpiness' Atmospheric: The baseball game painting is celebrated for the batter's asymmetrical limbs and flexible bat . Haunting: The face (left) is the artist's portrait of his partner Lynn while the portrait (right) is an unflattering likeness of Joan Crawford . 'In . any case, the work must be interesting and compelling. We favour pieces . that are clearly meant to communicate something to the viewer.' Among the esteemed pieces are an unflattering portrait of Hollywood starlet Joan Crawford, an Asian woman who suffers an unfortunate wardrobe malfunction and two naked giants holding airplanes. The jewel in the crown is 'Lucy In The Sky With Flowers', which inspired antiques dealer Scott Wilson to found the museum with his friend Jerry Reilly. He found the painting - of an elderly woman walking through a field of flowers - in a rubbish bin and realised it was so bad it was good. The piece is a commissioned portrait of Anna Keane that hung proudly in the family home until her daughter's death. The painting became the first in Mr Wilson and Mr Reilly's collection of odd works of art that would never find their way into a traditional gallery. Family: The museum praised the 'astonishing emphasis on facial bone structure' in 'Mama and Babe' Portrait of innocence: A young girl, dressed in white and wearing a straw hat, picks daisies in a green field . Provocative: A nude who 'can scratch her back and armpit simultaneously' (left) and two naked giants play with blimps and planes (right) Disaster-pieces: An Asian woman suffers an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction after sneezing . The museum now attracts about 8,000 people a year who visit to see the art and the synopses written underneath by the curators. The inscription below Lucy In The Sky With Flowers reads: 'The motion, the chair, the sway of her breast, the subtle hues of the sky, the expression on her face - every detail combines to create this transcendent and compelling portrait, every detail cries out ""masterpiece.""' Ms Reilly Sacco said they write out of respect to the artist. She said: 'We are the first institution to . collect, exhibit, and celebrate these works that would otherwise never . receive the recognition they deserve. 'We . do this while being respectful of the artists, and offering our . interpretations of these heartfelt pieces in which something has gone . awry. 'Everyone has the experience of walking past a gallery when a friend says ""Wow! Look at that."" 'Until you turn to look, you don't know if it will be very good or very bad.

The Duke of York has opened his own Twitter account - the first member of the Royal family to do so. He posted his first tweet this morning using the handle @TheDukeOfYork and wrote: 'Welcome to my Twitter account -AY'. The Queen's second son had hundreds of followers within seconds, some of them 'trolls' who sent him abusive messages over the social network. His biography on the social network says it is the 'Official Twitter account for The Duke of York' and notes that 'tweets from HRH are signed -AY', short for Andrew York. Within three hours of opening his account, which has an official 'blue tick' symbol to show it is genuine, the 53-year-old prince had 5,000 followers and was following 40 people on Twitter. Most of those the prince had chosen to follow were organisations or establishments that he had worked with before, but his personal interests were reflected, too, in his following of Hunstanton Golf Club in Norfolk and the Royal Liverpool Golf Club.  The prince is a keen golfer with a low handicap, and became patron of the Hunstanton links after his father relinquished the role. One Twitter account he had yet to follow at the time of writing was that of his ex-wife Sarah, Duchess of York, who tweets using the handle @SarahThe Duchess.  With 62,130 followers, she has a headstart on him in terms of follower numbers. While many people welcomed the fourth in line to the throne, others gave him a quick introduction to the less savoury side of online life, with some suggesting the -AY sign off made him sound like comedian Ali G. Others were more offensive, but the majority made jokes about the Duke of York needing 10,000 men to march up the hill - a reference to the nursery rhyme. Prince's first tweet: Some people suggested that by signing tweets with his initials he sounded like Ali G . Personal interests: Prince Andrew, a keen golfer, is following two well-known golf clubs on Twitter . One Twitter user, Sarah Delaney, sent the prince the message: 'I'd like to see some selfies and pictures of what you're having for your tea'. When the prince is not tweeting personally, tweets from his account will be written by members of his office.  The second and third tweets on his account were not written by him and had links to photographs of the prince carrying out official duties. A spokesman for the prince said: 'The Duke has long been an early and enthusiastic adopter of new technology. 'He was in fact the first member of the British Royal Family to tweet on . the British Monarchy (account) when he visited Tech City. The logical . next step was to tweet individually.'

Accused: BTCC driver is alleged to have killed a cyclist as he drove a van while talking to his girlfriend on his mobile phone . A championship motor racing driver knocked down and killed a cyclist while he was talking to his girlfriend on his mobile phone, a court heard today. Frank Wrathall, 26, was chatting to model Zara Watt for almost eight minutes with one hand on the steering wheel before his van was involved in a collision with victim Paul Fingleton on a roundabout, it was said. The British Touring Car Championship driver, of Barnacre, Lancashire, denies causing the death of the 47-year-old father-of-one by dangerous driving at Preston Crown Court. Opening the trial, Francis McEntee, prosecuting, said Wrathall was on his mobile phone at the time of the fatal collision at Broughton roundabout on the A6 near Preston on May 14 last year. The Citroen van he was driving did not have any Bluetooth and there was no facility for hands-free calling. At the time of the collision, Mr Fingleton, 47, from Fulwood, was cycling home from Goosnargh Tennis Club, where he had been with his wife Anne and daughter Hannah. But as he cycled past the entrance to the motorway sliproad, heading northbound, he was involved in a collision with the van, suffering injuries to his head and spine. He was taken to Royal Preston Hospital where medical staff worked for several hours to try to save his life but Mr Fingleton died from his injuries. Mr McEntee said: 'CCTV evidence is patently clear - the defendant came up from behind Mr Fingleton, overtook him and cut across him, causing the collision. 'The prosecution can say with a degree of confidence that the defendant was clearly unaware of Mr Fingleton’s presence.' Wrathall was arrested and told police Mr Fingleton had run into the side of him. Mr McEntee said: 'It was clearly a shock to the defendant when he saw CCTV showing Mr Fingleton entering onto the roundabout first.' An automatic number plate recognition camera, situated on the M55 above the junction, showed Wrathall using his phone as he approached the sliproad.

Mobile phone bills also revealed a seven minute phone call to Miss Watt. Mr McEntee said the defendant manouevred the large van, with his racing car being towed behind, onto the roundabout with just one hand on the steering wheel. He said: 'The defendant could not safely manouevre his large vehicle while engaged in an ongoing conversation with his girlfriend.' The defendant was chatting to model Zara Watt for almost eight minutes with one hand on the steering wheel before his van was involved in a collision with victim Paul Fingleton on a roundabout, it was claimed . Frank Wrathall celebrates following a race: After the driver was arrested he told police Mr Fingleton had run into the side of him . An automatic number plate recognition camera, situated on the M55 above the junction, showed Wrathall using his phone as he approached the sliproad . He added: 'You will be satisfied that the standard of driving that the defendant displayed was not simply careless, did not simply fall below the standard that would be expected of a competent and careful driver but that his standard of driving fell far below that standard and that you can properly be satisfied that his driving can be described as dangerous.' PC David Horsfield, who has been an officer for 20 years, works for the accident investigation unit. He told the court there was also a rubber mark on the side of the white Citroen van - which he suggested is from the end of the rubber handle of the bicycle. The court heard that Wrathall was talking to Miss Watt when the accident took place. Phone records show there was a nearly eight minute conversation between the pair . 'The mark suggests to me when they came together the cyclist must have been upright in the seat in a forward position. As a result of contact with him, he turned his handlebars to the left. 'A white iPhone was found in the foot well area on the driver’s side of the van which was seized.' He added: 'There is a general consensus that driving and talking on the telephone do not mix. It causes distraction. 'Studies have shown that having a conversation on a phone is far worse than talking to a passenger.' The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Frank Wrathall denies causing the death of father-of-one Paul Fingleton .

Rowe . has offered a conflicting portrait of Jackson's medical treatments . during her testimony, saying earlier that she never saw him engage in . doctor shopping or request specific pain medications.

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 19:41 EST, 13 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:26 EST, 14 August 2013 . Reforms: Justice minister Damian Green . Magsitrates are to be given the power to overrule police officers who give ‘soft’ spot-fines and cautions to violent thugs and thieves. The ‘scrutiny’ powers will allow victims to challenge officers who let criminals off with out-of-court penalties. It could result in offenders who were originally handed a caution or other penalty being called to court to receive a tougher sentence. Justice Minister Damian Green will announce the reforms today as part of a speech on criminal justice. He will say: ‘There is definitely a place for out-of-court disposals in ensuring justice is brought in cases which may otherwise not have come to court and as a proportionate response to some low-level offending. ‘But we need to make sure that it is only these cases which are getting out-of-court disposals, and that all cases which should properly be brought before a court are brought to court.’ The use of cautions is currently the subject of a major review ordered by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, which is expected to report within weeks. Huge disparities between forces in how cautions are used have raised concerns about ‘postcode justice’. Overall, the police handed out 205,700 cautions in the year to September 2012, according to the latest Ministry of Justice figures. More than ten per cent were for violent attacks, one in three were for theft and handling stolen goods, and a third were for drug offences. Tens of thousands more are dealt with using only ‘restorative justice’ programmes, which critics say amount to little more than an apology. The new measure is likely to appeal to shopkeepers infuriated by failures to prosecute thieves who are let off with an £80 spot-fine. The new measure is likely to appeal to shopkeepers infuriated by failures to prosecute thieves who are let off with an £80 spot-fine . It could also be used by those who confront drunken yobs only to see them avoid going to court.The plan is part of a wider move to redefine magistrates’ responsibilities. Mr Green will warn that thousands of cases they could deal with end up in the crown court unnecessarily. Some 4,000 offenders sent before a crown court were given a sentence of six months in prison or less – which magistrates could have dispensed. But Mr Green will say that the Government needs ‘to get the balance right at the lower end of the spectrum as well’. He will float plans to take thousands of low-level driving offences out of the courtroom. Instead of facing a full hearing before a panel of three magistrates, those who jump red lights, drive without valid documents or commit parking offences would be dealt with by a single magistrate ‘sitting in an office’. The new process would apply only in cases where the driver pleaded guilty – around nine in ten of the half-million such cases handled annually by the courts. Mr Green will say: ‘The time magistrates spend in court should be focused on those cases where they make a real difference to their communities. ‘Their core skills of deciding on bail, fact-finding and sentencing should be put to best effect.’","The reforms to be announced by Justice Minister Damian Green today .

A manager at the prestigious New York Athletic Club allegedly demanded sexual favours from female employees in return for prime hours and weekends off, according to court papers. It is claimed that banquet supervisor Nesim Zuberi, 45, 'had his own harem' of female employees at the Manhattan club and took photographs and videos of encounters with them to show to co-workers. Mr Zuberi is also said to have shown pictures of his penis to colleagues and images of him and his wife involved in a sexual act with a 'Russian lady', according to the papers seen by the New York Post. Claims: Nesim Zuberi is alleged to have had his own 'harem' of female employees at the New York Athletics Club, pictured . The papers claimed that he asked female staff to join him in late night orgies in exchange for plum work assignments. Lawyer for Keisi Ballenilla, a former employee of the club who was sole plaintiff in the related 2011 lawsuit said: 'Zuberi had (and possibly still has) his own harem made up of vulnerable female club employees).' Ballenilla made the claims in a deposition made earlier this year and seen by the Post. She claimed that at least five employees were involved in the trysts, with one female banquet server allegedly pressured into having sex with Mr Zuberi. The woman involved was also said to be involved in a sexual relationship with a Catholic priest at the time. Exclusive: Annual membership of the prestigious club costs $3,000 to maintain after an $8,500 joining fee . According to the deposition, Ms Ballenilla claims that she was coerced into having sex with Zuberi on a billiard table at the club. She also alleges that in 2009, while pregnant with her daughter, Mr Zuberi still demanded sex. But the club has fiercely denied the allegations. NYAC spokesman James O'Brien told the Post: 'As soon as the lawsuit was filed, our outside legal counsel conducted an exhaustive investigation and concluded that the allegations were without merit.' Mr Zuberi also strenously denied the allegations, telling the paper: 'Listen, there's no truth to any of this.' Alumni: Four time Olympic discus champion Al Oerter was a member of N.Y.A.C .

They have also been forced to live with the noise and disturbance caused from the building work. One resident said their apartment is constantly flooded while another described the academic as a 'menace'.

'He's broken drains so we're always being flooded when it rains and there are huge structural cracks in our ceiling and walls,' they added. 'He is a menace as a neighbour and he didn't get any permission to build this monstrosity,' said another. Neighbours will yet again have to suffer building noise as the dismantling began today.

Hernandez cries throughout the whole process, and once the inspector leaves, he slumps to the ground with his head in his hands, rocking back and forth while sobbing. The amount of cigarettes and candy he lost equates to about a week's worth of work, according to the AP. Meanwhile another man steps forward to help the boy recollect the candy. According to Hernandez's aunt, the boy had came to Villahermosa about 10 days prior from his home in the Tzotzil Indian village of San Juan Chamula in the Chiapas state where he lives with his grandparents. He planned to spend the summer with his aunt selling goods on the street to save money for school. While Mexican children get their textbooks for free, they have usually have to provide their own pencils, paper and uniforms. After the incident the video was posted online and in just one week the story went viral, one video getting over a million views, which has caused an outpouring of support for the targeted boy. On Wednesday the city announced that they had fired Lopez. While it was illegal for the underage boy to be selling cigarettes, they agreed that the punishment was out of line - especially considering his native people were enslaved in the region until a century ago. Then the governor of Tabasco, Arturo Nunez, said that he would be giving the boy 'a scholarship as well as all medical and psychological help' in an announcement Thursday. Lupita Santiago, a spokesman for the Chiapas state child welfare agency, also vouched to provide Hernandez with 'all necessary help.' She said that Hernandez speaks only limited Spanish, and while his age is listed as 10, he could be older since many in his community wait to register births. On Friday the National Human Rights Commission said it would investigate the incident. 'Any form of violence against children is totally unacceptable, especially when directed against Indians, who are the most vulnerable groups in the country,' the commission said in a statement. Since the incident, the boy has gone back home to Chiapas, where Santiago said he is going well.","10-year-old Manuel Diaz Hernandez, a Tzotzil Indian spending the summer in Villahermosa, was selling goods on the street Monday when he was targeted by a city inspector .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:44 EST, 14 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:57 EST, 14 August 2013 . Political parties spend 22 times more trying to buy the votes of people in crucial swing seats than other areas, new research shows. For people living in Bootle on Merseyside, their votes are worth just 14p each when the election campaign rolls into town. But winning over wavering voters in Luton South in Bedfordshire means each of them is worth £3.07, sparking claims ‘votes are not created equal after all’. Battleground: Just 14p was spent on each vote in Bottle, but £3.07 in the hotly contested fight in Luton South. The darker green areas on the map are the seats where more money was spent trying to win over swing voters . The revelation is likely to reopen the row over the way the main parties target a tiny number of seats which decide the outcome of general elections. It will also renew calls to redraw constituencies so that each seat has the same number of votes, ending the idea of seats remaining rock solid Labour or Tory. The way that parties raise and spend funding has been making headlines again after it emerged the Tories and Lib Dems carved up a £520,000 donation left to the Government of the day. The coalition parties have returned the money after it emerged Joan Edwards, 90, from Bristol wanted it to go to which ever political party was in power. But they still face questions over big money donations, with the Tories accused of accepting £1million in three months from businesmen who were invited to dinner with the PM and Lib Dem donor James Palumbo, founder of Ministry of Sound, given a peerage weeks after writing a cheque for £65,000. Find out how much your vote is worth here . New figures this week also showed . that 72 per cent of big donations to the Labour party came from just . five trade unions, including £722,000 from Unite. Some . seats are so safe that candidates spend almost nothing, because they . are either certain or winning or know that campaigning will mean pouring . their money down the drain. The Tories and Lib Dems today agreed to payback a £520,000 bequest to the nation left in an elderly spinster’s will. The coalition parties came under fire after it emerged they carved up the money left by former nurse Joan Edwards to the Government to spend ‘as they may think fit’. Instead . of using the money on the Health Service, schools or to ease the . national debt, the Coalition shared it between them as a party donation. But . after a furious backlash, including mounting criticism from their own . MPs, David Cameron and Nick Clegg ordered their parties to return the . money to government funds. Miss . Edwards solicitors moved to end speculation today, claiming that . despite the clear wording of her will, she had reassured them that she . wanted the money to go to a political party. The . row erupted after party said Miss Edwards, who was 90 when she died, . had bequeathed the money to ‘whichever party’ was in power when she . died.  The Daily Mail tracked down a copy of the will – which made no mention of any party. In 195 seats – almost a third of the 650 contested in 2010 - no money was spent by any candidate on public meetings. In five seats - Ruislip, Northwood and . Pinner, Sheffield Heeley, East Ham, Sheffield Brightside and . Hillsborough, and Knowsley - no money was spent on advertising by any . candidate. And 348 candidates - 8.6 per cent of the total which stood for election - spent no money at all on their campaigns. According . to research by the Electoral Reform Society, in the 50 most hotly . contested seats spending per vote was 162 per cent higher than in the 50 . safest seats. Luton South, where Gavin Shuker won for Labour with a  majority of 2,239, saw the most spent for vote cast. It followed a fierce battle for the seat vacated by Labour MP Margaret Moran following revelations about her expenses. Aberconwy, Barking, Polra and Limehouse, Northampton North and Hampstead and Kilburn all saw more than £2 per vote spent. By comparison Bootle, which was Labour’s safest seat until the 2010 election with a majority of more than 25,000, saw just 14p spent. Labour's Joe Benton held the seat, with a majority of 21,181 over the Lib Dems. In Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner, where Tory minister Nick Hurd is the MP, just 18p was spent. Only 19p was spent in Tory safe seat South Leicestershire and 20p in Labour-held seats Halton and Sheffield Heeley. Katie Ghose, chief executive of the . Electoral Reform Society, said: ‘Elections in Britain have become the . ultimate postcode lottery. ‘The . amount of money which parties spend on attracting your vote depends . almost entirely on where you live. 'The fact that voters in Bootle are . valued 22 times less than those in Luton South shows that all votes are . not created equal after all.’ The study also shows how the political parties have given up on some areas altogether. Ten least valued seats . For example, the Tories and Lib Dems spent no money at all in the Scottish seat of Motherwell and Wishaw. Miss Ghosh added: ‘If you live in a marginal seat, then parties will spend money trying to attract your vote. But if you live in a safe seat – as so many people do – then you will be all but ignored. If we are going to redress the imbalance, both party funding and our electoral system need to be reformed. ‘We need properly and sustainably funded political parties incentivised to campaign across the country, not just in a few fiercely contested seats. ‘We need a party funding system that recognises the crucial role that parties play in mobilising voters. And we need an electoral system that values each voter equally no matter where they live.’ However, all three parties have ruled out the idea of increased taxpayer funding for campaigning.","Study shows how little is spent on rock solid safe seats .

A couple tired of handing over all their cash in mortgage payments have built a home from scratch that's so cheap their living expenses have fallen to just $350 a month - including bills. Carrie and Shane Caverly from Arizona say they were 'tired of living to work just for someone else' and their new simple life is saving them hundreds of dollars every month. They've swapped a conventional three-bedroom house for a life on the road with a mobile home which has a floor area of just 204sq/ft - and say its bringing them closer together. The new pioneers: Tired of handing over all . their cash in mortgage payments, Carrie and Shane Caverly from Arizona . have built this tiny home that's so cheap their living expenses have . fallen to just $350 a month . Simple life: Since there's not much space inside . their new 204sq/ft home the couple also enjoy the great outdoors more . often, with Mr Caverly saying that whenever the Sun shines he's outside . soaking it up . Mr Caverly told the New York Daily News: 'I know what it's like to have a big house with a tremendous amount of stuff. This culture of acquiring more is not necessarily a healthy way to live.' The couple, who have been married since 2009, were spurred to fulfil long-held ambitions to downsize after Mr Caverly lost his home in the banking crisis. 'I ended up having to foreclose,' he told ABC News. 'Now with the market the way it is and everything, I decided I don't want to play that game any more.' He added to the Daily News: 'I got absolutely tired of it, all the interest I was paying. At that point, I said I’m not going to deal with banks ever again.' A view through the house takes in the living . room kitchen AND bedroom: Since Mr Caverly works as a builder, and his . wife is an architectural designer, the pair had more than enough . expertise for the build . Creature comforts: Mrs Caverly works on her . laptop which is resting on a flip out desk attached to her sofa. The . couple were spurred to fulfil ambitions to downsize after Mr . Caverly lost his home in the banking crisis . This is where the magic happens: The Caverlys' bedroom is just large enough to fit their queen-sized bed . Efficient use of space: Beneath the bed there is enough room for a wardrobe and even a dog kennel, while the bathroom is little more than a shower with a built-in sink. There is more storage space above the shower unit . Since Mr Caverly works as a building contractor, and his wife is an architectural designer, the pair were had more than enough expertise to make their dream a reality . The Caverly's compact home, which measures just 24ft by eight feet, has been designed with their habits in mind and uses every inch as efficiently as possible. Their possessions, which they have had to dramatically cull, can be stashed in storage spaces beneath their living room sofa and above their bathroom, which has been so miniaturised it consists of just a shower with a sink inside. To keep their lifestyles as eco-friendly as possible, the couple collect rainwater from their metal roof and use an incinerating toilet so they don't need their home to be plumbed in. Since there's not much space inside the couple also enjoy the great outdoors more often, with Mr Caverly saying that whenever the Sun shines he's outside soaking it up. On the road again: The whole home is built on the back of a trailer and can be towed wherever they want . Seeking adventure: Keen to get closer to the . untamed wilderness of the Rocky Mountains, the Caverlys recently hitched . their home to a pick up truck and moved from Arizona to Santa Fe, New Mexico . Of course, the real benefit is their dramatically slashed living costs. Land rent, electricty and water for their new home adds up to a paltry $350 (£230) a month, compared to the $1,500 (£980) they paid for their old house. 'I definitely analysed the options,' said Mrs Caverly. 'And if our expenses are $300 a month compared to $1,300 a month we can saive up so much more.' And though it can get cramped in the winter, compact living has its benefits. 'We can actually probably clean our whole house in about five minutes,' Mr Caverly told ABC. Moving too, is simple. Keen to get closer to the untamed wilderness of the Rocky Mountains, the Caverlys recently hitched their home to a pick up truck and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico.

It will be a poignant date for brothers Rob and Paul Forkan from Southfields, London, - as it was the last time they saw their parents, Kevin and Sandra. But it is also the date when they hope to open a children's home in Goa, the product of years of hard work to build something positive out of their family tragedy. The family were caught up in the natural disaster while they were staying in Sri Lanka in 2004. Rob and Paul, then aged 17 and 15 respectively, survived by clinging on to the roof of a building when the giant wave hit the coastline. Scroll down for video . Fashion with a purpose: Brothers Rob and Paul sell flip flops to help under privileged children around the world . Target: They hope to have enough money to open their first children's home in Goa at the end of next year . Their . parents had managed to get their younger brother, Mattie, then aged 12, . and sister, Rosie, eight, to safety before being swept away. The orphans were left with nothing and had to hitchhike across the devastated country to make it back to Britain where they would be cared for by their extended family and friends. But rather than being broken by the tragedy, the brothers decided to do something positive to honour the memory of their mother and father and help other orphaned children around the world. Taking inspiration from their philanthropist parents, who had given up their jobs in the fashion industry to volunteer for humanitarian projects, the pair designed flip flops made from natural materials with a woven rope style. Best foot forward: Their initial design, left, used natural materials before they changed to rubber with more vibrant colours . Fan: Sir Richard Branson stocks the flip flops on his island and wears them himself . In style: Michelle Keegan, left, and Binky Felstead have stepped out in Gandys flip flops . Under the brand name Gandys, sales of the flips flops funds their 'Orphans for Orphans' initiative. Their goal is to raise enough money to open their first children's home by the end of next year in Goa. So far their enterprise has also funded a teacher and a nurse in India for a year and bought school supplies for over 100 children in Asia. Rob, now 25, told the MailOnline: 'We travelled the world with our parents as they carried out volunteer work. They wanted to quit the rat race to experience other cultures and make a difference. 'They sold our family home in Croydon and took my brothers and sister and I out of school and we moved initially to India.

'We wanted to build a brand based on our beliefs and family values with the target of opening our first children's home in Goa on the tenth anniversary of the tsunami.' Starting out from their bedroom in Brixton, the flip flop design evolved to be made from rubber while still incorporating the distinctive pleated toe bar. They have men and women's styles with vibrant colours and patterns. Thanks to the brothers hard work and marketing skills, the flip flops are now being stocked by Selfridges, Schuh and Topman (where they sold out after first going on sale) among other well-known shoe stores.

A DNA test has revealed Scott Disick is the father of Kourtney Kardashian's son Mason, dismissing a male model's claims of paternity. The 33-year-old reality TV star was asked by model Michael Girgenti to allow Mason, three, to undergo the test, after he claimed they slept together while she and Scott, 30, were on a break in their relationship in March 2009. But lab results from tests taken on August 12 have proved his allegations are false. Family bond: Scott, pictured here in July, shares two children with Kourtney from their seven year relationship and has been confirmed as Mason's father . Kourtney, who has always denied Michael's . allegations, told E! News: 'After three-and-a-half years of lies being . spread by an individual I met briefly at a photo shoot, I am setting the . record straight that Scott is Mason's father. 'While it saddens me to . have to address these ridiculous lies - especially when the truth was . never in doubt - this story must be put to rest.' However, Mr Girgenti appeared to not have accepted the results of the text as conclusive and plans to press ahead with the paternity lawsuit he filed earlier this month in which he claims he had 'unprotected vaginal sex' with Kourtney in March 2009 at his Glendale, California apartment. 'We don’t trust the results and believe it could have been fixed,' his spokesperson told Radar. 'Still going to court to fight for court ordered results.' Legal . bid: Michael Girgenti reportedly reached out to Kourney Kardashian in a . letter months before launching a legal bid for a court ordered DNA test . in the first steps towards a custody battle over her son Mason . Strain: Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick, pictured going for sushi earlier this week hope that the story will now be put to rest . Mr Girgenti had claimed that he fathered Kourtney Kardashian's son Mason amid a steamy love affair. But . before taking the case to court, he reportedly wrote an impassioned . letter to the reality star urging her to submit to a DNA test. According to RadarOnline . the letter, dated April 23, stated that the 26-year-old male model . wished to avoid dragging Kourtney and her partner Scott to court. 'My attentions [sic] are not to hurt the family you've created with Scott,' Girgenti wrote. 'Please . take this final request for a DNA test seriously,' he wrote before . taking on a more stern tone: 'Because if you don't, I will be forced to . take legal action and sue.' Saddened: Kourtney expressed her frustration that she had to address the ridiculous allegations . He continued: 'I assure you I don't take being a father lightly. I will be a great father to Mason.' Last week, Girgenti filed paperwork at a Los Angeles County Superior Court in . a bid to get joint custody of the three-year-old child . alleging he had unprotected sex with the reality TV star nine months . before Mason's birth. The lawsuit documents the alleged . relationship between Kourtney and Michael, which he claims heated up in . August 2008, and continued with months of texting in which she told him . her relationship with Scott was 'on the . outs' and 'she wanted to hang'. According . to gossip website TMZ.com, Michael wanted the judge to order DNA tests . for Kourtney, Mason and her long-term boyfriend Scott. Photogenic: Kourtney and Michael met on a photo shoot in 2008, but the star's attorney says there was no further contact after that .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:39 EST, 16 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 23:56 EST, 16 August 2013 . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Friday acted on new legislation that will make it easier for children and teenagers suffering from serious illnesses to obtain medical marijuana. Christie agreed to sign the so-called pot-for-tots bill if the New Jersey legislature makes changes, including removing wording that would have reduced the number of required physician recommendations for children. He also agreed that children should be allowed access to edible forms of marijuana besides lozenges, considered difficult for young patients to use properly, but asked for tighter language in the bill to be sure only minors can get the medication. Governor Chris Christie: He has said he will sign a bill to help sick children get access to medical marijuana if lawmakers tweak the bill to ensure only qualifying patients get the drug . Pushing for change: Father, Brian Wilson, asked Gov. Christie to change the law in order that an edible form of medical marijuana-- not sold at dispensaries in the state-- becomes available for their sick child . Hope at last: Vivian Wilson suffers from a severe form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome. She started having seizures at two months old. They say she still seizes, on average, 15 times a day. Her parents believe medicinal cannabis could help . Christie agreed with other parts of the bill, including eliminating the three-strain cultivation limit on authorized dispensaries, which would allow growers to develop products tailored for individual patients, including some adults, according to proponents. Christie, who is running for re-election as New Jersey's governor and widely considered a contender for president in 2016, gave his 'conditional' approval to the bill but sent it back to the legislature with the suggested changes. Christie previously worried about going 'down the slippery slope of broadening a program and making it easier to get marijuana that wouldn't necessarily go to other people'—and these modifications are perhaps a strategic compromise to not slide down the 'slippery slope.' 'Today, I am making commonsense recommendations to this legislation to ensure sick children receive the treatment their parents prefer, while maintaining appropriate safeguards,' Christie said in a statement released Friday. 'I am calling on the Legislature to reconvene quickly and address these issues so that children in need can get the treatment they need.' 'As I have repeatedly noted, I believe that parents, and not government regulators, are best suited to decide how to care for their children,' Christie continued. But some of the bill's sponsors preferred the original language, which would open up the number of marijuana strains and ingestible forms to a wider range of patients, as well as an easier application process. Change: For parents to get their kids the strains of marijuana they need three different doctors to sign off on the prescriptions for their kids but now it is hoped a change in the law will simplify things . Cure: Vivian Wilson, of Scotch Plains, New Jersey, is among a number of patients with legal authorization to receive medical marijuana. But, her parents say, she has yet to receive any medication due to the state's restrictive medical marijuana program . 'I think it is ironic that Governor Christie believes that parents and government regulators should make the decision. This might be the most regulated law in the state,' state Sen. Joseph Vitale, one of the primary sponsors of the bill, told CNN Friday. 'The last thing we want is to delay it for the kids, so we want to pass it as soon as possible,' Vitale continued. 'It still requires too many unnecessary hurdles with physicians, but I don't think we should hold it up anymore.' Assemblyman Reed Gusciora said older residents who can't ingest marijuana smoke should have access to an edible form. But he, too, prefers prompt action on the bill. New Jersey is one of 19 states with a medical marijuana program, but the state's rules have made it difficult for young patients to enroll in treatment, according to proponents of the bill. The legislation has been sitting on Christie's desk for nearly two months and his conditional approval comes two days after he was confronted at a campaign stop by a Scotch Plains father whose 2-year-old suffers from Dravet Syndrome, a potentially deadly form of epilepsy. Brian Wilson urged Christie in a restaurant full of voters to sign the bill saying, 'Don't let my daughter die.' Wilson said the kind of marijuana that helps stop his daughter's seizures currently is grown only in Colorado. Simplified: If the bill is passed only one doctor's authorization would be required for dispensing medical marijuana to a child. Currently three doctors are required to sign off on a child's prescription . Brian Wilson told CNN's Jake Tapper: 'While it is a small victory ... it really just maintains the idea of making (New Jersey) one of the worst medical marijuana programs in the country. So it's a small victory but it's kind of ludicrous in a lot of ways.' Christie wants the state to keep the existing requirement of approval by at least a pediatrician and a psychiatrist for a child to be part of the medical marijuana program. 'The psychiatrist is just a roadblock,' Wilson said. 'There's no rhyme or reason to have a psychiatrist be part of this decision. You're talking about sick kids who aren't even mentally necessarily capable of talking. Vivian can't even talk.' Christie acknowledged that marijuana is a controlled substance under U.S. federal law and 'implementing a state controlled program while the drug remains illegal has raised numerous challenges.' The administration of President Barack Obama has discouraged federal prosecutors from pursuing people who distribute marijuana for medical purposes under state laws.","Gov. Christie recommends two changes to bill before he signs it .
Bill would remove limit on strains of cannabis that can offer in New Jersey .
Patients would have access to other types of cannabis that wouldn't normally be available such as edible forms .
Bill also would make it simpler for children to qualify ."

British holidaymakers staged a sit-in at a luxury Caribbean resort after an ‘invasion’ of locals who used the pool as a toilet and ate all the food in the buffet. More than 160 guests held a near two-day protest after hundreds of ‘drunk and rowdy’ islanders caused chaos at the five-star ClubHotel Riu Merengue in the Dominican Republic. Tony Walton, 48, says his £12,000 family holiday with Thomson was ruined by Dominicans who arrived on a cheap all-inclusive deal. Angry British holidaymakers congregated in the hotel's reception, demanding action by their tour rep . Bare: Tony Walton took this picture of the empty buffet at the hotel where he was on an all-inclusive break . The sales manager from Doncaster . said: ‘They destroyed everything, ate everything. They were washing . themselves down fully in the shower by the pool. And there was no food – . they took it all.’ He added: ‘I have nothing against Dominicans, these people were not at all representative – they were drunk and rowdy.’ He said the pool had to be closed . after it was used as a lavatory, and said locals even urinated on sun . loungers while people lay on them. Staff who were told about the . disruption allegedly told the family to take excursions at their own . expense to get away from the hotel. Mr Walton was then told to pay £1,800 . if he wanted to move his wife, two children and four other family . members to another hotel nearby. Five days into the two-week break . near the north coast city of Puerto Plata, Mr Walton was so angry that . he organised a sit-in with other guests at the resort’s Thomson desk. Eventually around 100 British tourists were moved to another hotel nearby - but claimed it had fewer facilities . Up to 100 people, including his . group, were finally moved to a less swish hotel – but were offered just . £30 compensation, he said. Mr Walton, who is due to fly home on . Sunday, says he has gathered complaints from 176 guests and will . continue the fight once he returns. A review on the website Trip Advisor yesterday described similar problems at the hotel. Natalie Steer, who stayed there for a . week from June 30, told how she had queued for food for almost 30 . minutes before finding it had ran out – because locals had stacked . plates ‘with every choice on the buffet’. ‘The pool was nice before the locals arrived,’ she added. Thomson said it is investigating the complaints. Riu Hotels added: ‘The culture in the Dominican Republic is very different.’ Mr Walton said: 'The hotel in itself was fine. But . then there was an influx of lots of local people who deteriorated the . atmosphere. They had come on a very cheap package holiday that is all . inclusive for locals. ‘They . destroyed everything, ate . everything. They were s****** and p****** in the pool and on the beach. They were washing themselves down fully in the shower by the pool. ' He added: ‘People were peeing on the . sun loungers with people on them. These people had no respect for . anything. They peed up against y sun lounger while I was lying on it.' The pool at the ClubHotel Riu Merengue was closed after busloads of locals arrived and used it as a lavatory . Escape: Mr Walton and his family were moved but he said: 'My holiday and my wife's birthday were ruined.' Mr Walton, who is spending the second week of his holiday organising complaints from 176 people in the hotel, said: 'Most of the other guests became ill with stomach upsets, including myself. ‘When we approached Thomson to complain they tried to send people on excursions to get out of the hotel at people’s cost - it was as if they wanted to make money out of people’s misery. ‘After three days, my brother-in-law and I tried to approach Thompson to change hotels. The lady said: ""No, you can’t move"". I said ""I’m staying here until we go."" ‘They wanted to charge me £1,800 to move my family to an acceptable hotel of the same standard. - Holidaymaker Tony Walton, 48, from Doncaster . ‘I said: ""I’m not going to pay for another hotel.” The holiday already was approaching £12,000 for the eight of us. 'I sat at the Thomson desk all day and watched people come with complaints at the rate of about 15 an hour. ‘I told the young lady who was trying to man the desk to call her boss. I’d been sat there from 9am to 3.30pm at this point. ‘By that time there were 160 complaining guests there. The [Thomson area] manager came and promised to look into it. ‘The hotel was expecting another 1,700 locals the next day so something had to be done. ‘We said we would cause a sit-in at the evening entertainment and welcome meetings. Even people who only had one or two days left of their holiday wanted to move.' Mr Walton said eventually up to 100 people, including his group, were moved to another hotel nearby with fewer facilities, but says he was offered just £30 compensation. How it looks in the brochure: ClubHotel Riu Merengue looks an idyllic place for a relaxing break . He said: ‘They said the amount we can now claim is smaller because we accepted to move – but we weren’t told this at any point. ‘It has ruined our holiday and my wife’s birthday. ‘I paid a lot of money and I have wasted it. Thomson have been absolutely useless and Riu [the hotel chain] even worse.' He says when he returns home he will take legal advice and added: 'The fight is not over.' A spokesman for Thomson told MailOnline: 'Thomson is sorry to hear that Mr Walton was disappointed with his stay at the Riu Merengue in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. 'We are aware that some customers expressed a disappointment with the levels of service during high occupancy and, as a gesture of goodwill, have moved them to a hotel nearby, including Mr Walton’s party. The hotel has 1,007 rooms, three swimming pools, watersports, a hairdresser and a poolside restaurant . 'We are not aware of any reported cases of illness and the majority of customers at the hotel have opted to stay and continue their holiday. 'Thomson takes customer satisfaction very seriously and is currently working with the hotelier to fully investigate Mr Walton’s complaint.' A spokesman for Riu Hotels told MailOnline: 'During the summer months, we do have local clients in our hotels in Puerto Plata, especially at weekends. 'The culture in the Dominican Republic is very different and it is very important to us that all clients enjoy their holidays in our hotels. 'We are working closely with the hotel and tour operators to investigate the complaints and solve any issues in the best possible way. ' A Trip Advisor review of the same hotel posted yesterday upheld Mr Walton's complaint about the hotel. Reviewer Natalie Steer, who stayed there from June 30 - July 7, wrote: The food times was a big problem as we was queuing for around 25 minutes sometimes, then getting pushed about and food running out due to locals stacking plates up with every choice on the buffet.' 'The pool was nice before the locals arrived and then we heard one of the locals urinating at the side of the pool and then to top it off someone pooed in the pool which meant the pool was closed for 24 hours.' She added: 'We booked trips as was advised by our rep to get out of the hotel during busy periods. Which isn't right as we had paid for the all inclusive so why should we be kicked out and made to feel unwelcome?' Thomson was criticised earlier this summer after two blind friends were told they could not go on holiday to Majorca together because they would not be able to see the inflight safety demonstration. Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, and Stephen Sherwood, 24, were looking forward to their break at the the luxury C'an Picafort resort in May, a holiday they had booked five months before. But just a fortnight before they were due to fly, and after having bought all their holiday clothes and Euros, Miss Wigglesworth, from Manchester, was told by Thomson that they would need to take a carer with them. Reading Thomson's description of ClubHotel Riu Merengue in the Dominican Republic, it's no wonder thousands flock there every year. The Thomson website says: 'With a beachfront setting, exotic gardens and a collection of authentic Caribbean shops, the Riu Merengue proves its worth as a tropical retreat. 'Riu Merengue has gotten the tropical setting down to a fine art – it’s backed by hills and fronted by a thick ribbon of sand.  What's more, the grounds are filled with palm-dotted gardens. 'Set back from the beach is a massive swimming pool criss-crossed by a bridge and bordered by thatched parasols. Keep walking and you’ll come to two more huge pools, plus a separate one for children. The Thomson brochure says the hotel is 'a tropical retreat' with 'a beachfront setting and exotic gardens' 'As for dining, the two main restaurants have buffet set-ups. Expect American-style spreads in the mornings, with eggs and omelettes cooked any way you want. And for lunch and dinner, there’s a pan-global offering. You can go down the à la carte route, too, with Italian cuisine and grilled favourites. 'Caribbean Street is well worth a look, too. This little road is shared with the neighbouring hotel Riu Bachata, and it’s lined with rainbow-coloured shops selling everything from chunky jewellery to sun cream.' A look at TripAdvisor.co.uk, however, tells a rather different story.  One review is entitled 'Overcrowded and not what we expected', while another is more directly entitled 'Do not come here!  Five star? Pushing 3 star at least!'","160 tourists at ClubHotel Riu Merengue have complained about the problems .

Eighteen years after it was released Rachael and Eliza Hurwitz, two sisters from North Haven, Connecticut made a parody video of Alanis Morissette's 'Ironic,' that pokes fun at the original song which was famously ridiculed by scholars and fans alike for not actually being ironic. In the song Morissette sings about several situations such as rain on your wedding day, finding a black fly in your drink, and being stuck in traffic when you're already late,  that though she labels ironic, are actually just a series of unlucky coincidences. Scroll down for videos . Alanis Morissette's (seen her in her musical video) 1998 music video for 'Ironic' was parodied on rhetorical grounds by two sisters . Sisters Eliza (seen here) and Rachael Hurwitz did a shot-for-shot spoof of Morissette's music video, making the unironic lyrics ironic . The 24-year old sisters rewrote the lyrics to the Grammy-nominated song for a version titled 'It's Finally Ironic,' and made a shot-for-shot remake of the music video that went viral on YouTube. Now seen over half a million times, the Hurwitz's parody embellishes on Morissette's original lyrics to take the raw situations she presents and inject irony into them. Though Morissette's 'Ironic' was a popular song in the late 90's her lyrics were ridiculed for lacking actual irony . Rachael Hurwitz came up with the idea to parody the song after she remembered a teacher criticizing Morissette for using the rhetoric device incorrectly . In the song's chorus Morissette sings, 'It's like rain on your wedding day,' to which the sisters add, 'a day and place you chose because it known not to rain.' Other memorable funny lyrics include, 'An old man turned 98, he won the lottery and died the next day,'  to which they added, 'from a severe paper cut from his lottery ticket.' In her music video Morissette taking a wild road trip with three different sides of herself. She appears in different outfits and hairstyles throughout the video . In the music video Rachael and Eliza (seen here) dress up as Morissette mimicking everything down to her hairstyles . The sisters, who imitate Morissette in the video spoof, wearing their hair in braids and performing eccentric antics, sing, 'We've got an editorial way of sneaking up on when you think your irony is ok and the examples in your song are right .' 'We've got an editorial way of helping you out when your song about irony is wrong and everyone says it to your face,' at the song's bridge. Morissette has taken a lot of criticism for her lyrics to 'Ironic' over the years. Critics say she uses the device incorrectly, listing scenarios that are unfortunate but not ironic . The Hurwitz sister's video went viral on YouTube getting over half a million views . Eliza even repeatedly intones in a sweet whisper, 'And that really is ironic. We fixed it for you Alanis, you're welcome.' Eliza and Rachael told The Wall Street Journal that the inspiration for the song came after they remembered . hearing an English teacher correcting the literary device improperly deployed in the lyrics. Alanis Morissette claimed that the irony in her video lies in the lack thereof in her lyrics, however critics and fans have never quite bought that explanation . The sister's filmed the video in Connecticut, reenacting the most iconic bits for the parody . Eliza, a stand-up . comedian, rewrote the lyrics and collaborated with Rachael, who is . pursuing a career in music to make the video, the paper reported. 'We felt like [a video] would pack the . most punch,' Eliza said. 'We were hoping we'd get a couple hundred . views, but then ['Star Trek' actor] George Takei tweeted about it and it . just blew up.' There's been no word yet  from Morissette on whether or not she finds the video funny, though hopefully this time she'll be able to find irony in the situation. Don't you think?

Young women are being held back by the belief they should put their children before their own ambitions, a leading headmistress warns today. Girls are still being brought up to believe that raising a family is more important than pursuing their personal goals, according to Hilary French. She said schoolgirls needed to learn they were free to make their own decisions about how to balance their careers with bringing up a child. Child rearers: Young women are being held back by the belief they should put their children before their own ambitions, a leading headmistress has warned . Mrs French, the new president of the Girls’ Schools Association, criticised the continuing assumption that women should be responsible for childcare. This was despite the emergence of a generation of ‘very caring’ young men who have an affinity with children. Young women are also going to university in greater numbers than men and achieving more than ever in the workplace. In her first interview as president, Mrs French told how pupils at her all-girls school - £10,750-a-year Central Newcastle High - were shocked by a talk from a female entrepreneur who told them she put her career before her child. Mrs French said she regularly runs a course for pupils which covers entrepreneurial and leadership skills and features outside speakers. ‘Eighteen months ago, one of the young entrepreneurs, a lady, dared to say that she had probably put her business ahead of her son, and the sharp intake of breath from all of the girls was audible,’ she said. ‘They were all absolutely shocked, so yes, we are still creating a generation of girls who think that the whole idea of looking after children is really the most important thing, once you have a child. ‘And who’s to say? That’s a whole ethical, moral argument. And it’s a very, very personal decision. ‘But, what’s maybe less personal, and maybe more incumbent on us as leaders in girls’ schools, is to try and get girls to see that it is a decision, and that there are options, and that it’s not wrong, and that’s where society needs to come into play as well. ‘It’s not wrong to make a particular decision, whatever it is.’ Mrs French said it was the responsibility of girls’ schools to help their pupils to ‘be strong in making decisions, and secure in the rightness of the decision that they have made’. Hilary French says girls are still being brought up to believe that raising a family is more important than pursuing their personal goals (file photo) She added there was ‘probably still the assumption’ that women will deal with childcare. ‘There has been an increase in the number of house-husbands, but the very fact that it is still newsworthy means it’s not accepted as the norm,’ she told the Press Association. ‘I think there’s a long way to go before there’s total equality in that area.’ She said it was now well-known that girls were going to university in increasing numbers. But Mrs French added: ‘We do still expect women to be at the core of the relationship, the homemaker, the person who brings up children and thinks about what everyone’s going to eat every day. It’s still, I think, unusual to find a man doing that.’ Men are largely still seen as the parent who will go out to work to support the family, she said. But she was ‘quite struck’ that young men nowadays are ‘very caring and do want to have children and do have an affinity with children.’ In a wide-ranging interview, Mrs French also urged girls to develop ‘soft skills’ as well as clocking up exam passes. ‘Yes, you need your exam results, you need your degree, but it’s a passport for opening a door, getting through a door, and then when you are actually working, there’s so many other things out there in society that you need, which is why it’s so good that girls’ schools, really good schools, and universities do so much more than teach the subjects, teach facts. ‘It’s so much more than sitting in front of a computer, it’s developing all of those other skills.’ And she raised concerns that Government plans to scrap GCSEs and replace them with more rigorous exams may ‘make a failing system more complicated and possibly more prone to absolute collapse in the end’. She said the Coalition was right ‘to make the system more rigorous and fit for purpose’ but argued the planned new exams would ‘not suit a huge proportion of children’.","Girls brought up believing raising a family is more important than aspirations .

Girls at a private school are bring taught how to 'blow their own trumpet' to help them get ahead in their careers. The pupils will be taught the art of boasting and how to promote themselves, amid studies that have found women are too timid when it comes to celebrating their success. Pupils at the all-girl £4,668-a-term Wimbledon High School are learning how to push themselves forward in the same way that boys do, so they won't miss out on top positions. Young women fear promoting themselves because they worry that they will be perceived as arrogant (picture posed by models) Girls will write down their achievements and success on postcards, which will be displayed around the single-sex school in south London. Headteacher Heather Hanbury says that girls are reluctant to celebrate themselves because they fear a backlash from their peers, and do not want to be perceived as arrogant or boastful. All too often women are reluctant to speak up about their achievements in the workplace (picture posed by model) She said: 'Within the world of work, . women do find it hard to self-promote because they have this view that . there will be a backlash; that being seen as too confident or vain will . actually make people dislike them. 'Men have been shown to get over that because they want this job or this pay rise,' she told The Daily Telegraph. But Ms Hanbury was keen to make sure the girls did not exaggerate their success, and come across like self-obsessed participants on reality TV shows. The week-long initiative is also designed to foster a sense of applauding others' achievements, amid fears that they are quick to put down their peers' achievements. Young women are being held back by . the belief they should put their children before their own ambitions, a . leading headmistress warned in December.

Mrs French, the new president of the Girls’ Schools Association, criticised the continuing assumption that women should be responsible for childcare. A survey in December last year found that women do not get pay rises, simply because they do not ask for them - the survey found that they are reluctant to knock on doors and demand a higher salary. Wimbledon High School has introduced the week-long initiative to encourage girls to recognise their success . Whereas the study, led by Andreas Liebbrandt and John List and published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in the Unites States, found that men were happily prepared to march into the boardroom and open negotiations . The survey found that women felt more confident asking for more money when they were told that the salary was negotiable, or when their boss instructed them to request a raise. The salary gap between the sexes in Britain is thought to be around 9.6 per cent, as women's earnings gradually increase. The Office of National Statistics records that full-time female workers are gradually closing the gulf between salaries, with hourly pay increasing by two per cent to £12.","Wimbledon High School pupils taught to 'blow their own trumpet'

A former prosecutor-turned-fugitive who handled the high-profile drug cases of Paris Hilton and Bruno Mars was found dead Wednesday in his Las Vegas home, his lawyer said. David Schubert, 49, had completed a five-month stint in prison for crack cocaine possession in April. He was found sitting in his truck in his home's garage with the windows rolled down, according to his lawyer and friend Lou Schneier. The Clark County coroner's office declined to comment. Suicide: David Schubert, 49, a former prosecutor-turned-fugitive who once handled the high-profile drug cases of celebrities Paris Hilton and Bruno Mars has been found dead in his Las Vegas home . Schubert spent 10 years as a Clark County prosecutor, including a stint as a liaison to a federal drug task force. He resigned in 2011 after he was arrested with $40 in rock cocaine and an unregistered handgun in his car. He fled to Mexico to avoid jail but returned to the U.S. He told a judge he felt he had been treated exceptionally harshly. He expected mandatory probation and a chance to wipe the felony conviction from his record. Famous: Paris Hilton, left, listens as her attorney David Chesnoff, center, shows the plea agreement to Judge Joe Bonaventure as prosecutor David Schubert, right looks on in county court . Prosecutor: Peter Hernandez, aka Bruno Mars, center, appears in court for a felony cocaine possession with Schubert on the far left. Schubert was famous after prosecuting Paris Hilton and Bruno Mars in their drug possession cases . But the judge refused to consider a plea deal, calling Schubert 'a disgrace to his oath as a prosecutor and a lawyer' and declaring that he wouldn't get special treatment. Schubert told the Las Review-Journal in a jailhouse interview that he felt singled out. 'I did what I did, and I accept the consequences,' he said. 'But I don't feel I was treated fairly by the system.' He was isolated for his own safety in prison because of his history as a prosecutor. Schneier said that may have contributed to Schubert's poisoning sense of injustice. The ex-prosecutor missed a check-in with his parole officer last week, Schneier said. Clark County Courthouse: This is the building where David Schubert spent most of time and the same place where he received his own jail sentence for drug possession . His phone had been turned off for at least a week, possibly because he couldn't afford the bill. After a few visits to Schubert's home, parole officers finally entered early Wednesday and found the body, Schneier said. 'I saw warning signs,' he said. 'Dave was extremely angry and despondent over the way he was being treated. It cost him his dignity, his law license, and finally, his life.' Schubert's sentence contrasted with those of the people he helped prosecute. Both Hilton and Mars made plea deals and avoided jail time. The ex-prosecutor is survived by a 15-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter who live with their mother in another state. Schneier said the last time he spoke to his client was several weeks ago, after a text message fight. 'He called and said told me let's just stop this because that he loved me like a friend,' Schneier said/ .","David Schubert, 49, was the victim of an apparent suicide at his home .

The National Mall got a taste of the apocalypse this morning when 1,000 dead fish floated to the surface of one of the park's ponds. The fish were found lifelessly bobbing on the surface of the Constitution Gardens pond at the National Mall Thursday. Carol Johnson, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said there was nothing suspicious about the incident saying it usually happens each summer. Scroll down for video . The reaping: About 1,000 dead sunfish floated to the surface of the Constitution Gardens pond in the National Mall this morning . Ongoing problem: A National Park Service spokesman explained that the pond's closed system made this a normal occurrence during the hot summer months . Since the pond isn't near a river, the ecosystem isn't able to refresh itself. When the weather gets warm the algae dies and when it dies it sucks oxygen out of the water, killing the fish. Ms Johnson said most of the fish killed were small sunfish, about three or four inches long. Fish funeral: Most of the fish killed were sunfish about three to four inches long . Carp and bass are some of the other fish in the pond, but were relatively unaffected by the mass death. Ms Johnson told ABC News that the pond's closed off construction makes it an 'ongoing problem' but that they've 'identified it as an area that needs to be worked on.' Cleaning up: The park spokesman said they were unsure whether the fish would be replaced . Reconstruction: A pond redesign is necessary to stop the problem happening in the future . She told MailOnline that the pond needs a 'wholesale reconstruction' and that the pond may get that when the Trust for the National Mall votes to start one of two new projects. The trust is a non-profit the NPS partners with and they recently launched a competition to redesign both the Constitution Gardens and the Washington Monument Grounds.  They will soon vote on which project to start first.","A National Park Service spokesman says fish wash up dead almost every summer due to the heat and closed ecosystem of the pond .

A baby boy has made a miraculous recovery after being born with a giant cyst so large that it looked like he had two heads. Harry Barron-Edgley was born perfectly healthy apart from the 13cm cyst on the side of his neck. The growth was so large that his concerned mother, Ellie Wellman-Smith, 20, initially believed her baby had been born with two heads. Harry Barron-Edgley has made an amazing recovery after being born with a 13cm cyst on his neck. The growth was so big that his mother, Ellie Wellman-Smith, initially thought he had two heads . But thankfully, after five operations, doctors have finally been able to remove the growth which was causing Harry to suffer from back and neck problems. The 15-week-old is now back at home in Corby, Northamptonshire, with his family. ‘As soon as I'd given birth to Harry I closed my eyes in relief, I was so pleased I'd got him out,’ said Ms Wellman-Smith. ‘But when I opened my eyes as they handed me to him I was so shocked - I thought he'd been born with two heads. ‘I had no idea what it was - whether it was cancer or a tumour or something he'd have forever, it was really scary. ‘I was so overwhelmed with love for him, I wasn't worried about how it looked, I just wanted my baby to be OK. Harry (pictured with his mother Ellie, 20) was experiencing back and neck problems because of the cyst. He has undergone five operations to remove it . ‘I just feel so lucky that the doctors were able to remove it. Harry's neck looks amazing now - you'd never have known what was there before.’ Doctors were initially concerned that Harry's growth may be something sinister, but Ms Wellman-Smith was relieved when she was told that the cyst was purely cosmetic. Harry had been born with a lymphatic malformation - a collection of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, that result from a malformation in the lymphatic system - the system meant to drain fluid from tissues. The sacks, which can leak causing growths to increase in size, occur when the lymph vessels fail to form correctly during the first few weeks of pregnancy. Ms Wellman-Smith said: 'I was so overwhelmed with love for him, I wasn't worried about how it looked, I just wanted my baby to be OK' ‘As soon as the midwives saw Harry's lump they pressed a buzzer and within about 30 seconds 20 doctors were in the room,’ said Ms Wellman-Smith. ‘They were checking around the growth and putting things down his throat to see if he was breathing. ‘Then he was whisked to the special care baby unit and there was about an hour and a half when I didn't even know if he was alive. ‘He had an ultrasound scan the next morning and I was relieved when the doctors eventually told us that Harry had a lymphatic malformation and that it was just a cosmetic problem. Doctors were initially concerned that Harry's growth may be something sinister, but Ms Wellman-Smith was relieved when she was told that the cyst was purely cosmetic . ‘We were discharged from hospital and given an outpatient appointment three weeks later to discuss his treatment. ‘We're really lucky because if they'd have used forceps or given me a C-section they could have cut into the growth and Harry could have bled to death.’ At the outpatient's appointment, Ms Wellman-Smith was told that her son could be given an injection therapy to decrease the size of the cyst. Disappointed with the news that it would not be removed completely, Ms Wellman-Smith received a second opinion from Mr Kuo, a consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon at Birmingham Children's Hospital. Harry was born with a lymphatic malformation - a collection of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, that result from a malformation in the lymphatic system . Ms Wellman-Smith said: ‘After our first appointment I was told that the cyst would never fully go away and I was just really worried that Harry would get bullied because it was so large. ‘I felt like his future looked very bleak and that Harry's life was going to be horrible. ‘The growth was starting to bend his back and I was just so concerned. ‘But when I got in touch with Mr Kuo he was amazing. He brought Harry in for a scan and then gave us the fantastic news that the cyst could be removed.’ 'As soon as the midwives saw Harry's lump they pressed a buzzer and within about 30 seconds 20 doctors were in the room,' said Ms Wellman-Smith . On the first of July Harry underwent his first surgery. ‘When Harry went for his operation it was the worst day of my life,’ said Ms Wellman-Smith. ‘Watching the doctors put him to sleep was horrible - I just felt him slipping away, I was a mess. ‘He was in surgery for five hours and then I went up to see him in ICU. Harry had an operation to remove the cyst but it kept swelling up so he had to return to surgery four times to have it drained. He has now been able to go home . ‘It was really weird at first to see him without the cyst. The cyst was part of my baby and that's how I'd carried him. ‘It was strange but it was amazing too.’ Whilst the initial surgery was a success, Harry has since had to go through four more procedures. ‘The cyst keep swelling up so he's had to go in a few more times to get it drained,’ said Ms Wellman-Smith. Ms Wellman-Smith said: 'It was really weird at first to see him without the cyst. The cyst was part of my baby and that's how I'd carried him. It was strange but it was amazing too' ‘We're back at home now though and I just couldn't be happier. ‘Everyone at Birmingham Children's hospital has been great - especially Mr Kuo. ‘Harry can finally start living his life.’ Mr Kuo, consultant ear nose and throat surgeon at Birmingham Children's Hospital, said: ‘This is a very uncommon condition and can happen anywhere in the body. ‘They vary from being very small to very large, and can either be made up of lots of small cysts or lots of large ones. Harry's cyst was removed by Mr Kuo at Birmingham Children's Hospital on July 1 . ‘How you treat them varies from child to child. I always see the children together with specialist children's radiologist, Dr Simon McGuirk, so that we can discuss with the parents what the relative advantages of surgery and injection treatment are. ‘In Harry's case, the cyst was very large but it didn't obstruct the airway so he was lucky. ‘We were able to operate and I'm pleased with Harry's results. It's important when you operate to avoid the nerves that affect things like smiling and facial expressions. ‘We always leave a little bit of extra skin to allow for contraction but eventually you'll hardly see anything at all. ‘Harry has done extremely well.’","Harry Barron-Edgley was born healthy apart from the huge cyst .

Sir John Soane (right) was the son of a bricklayer who rose to become professor of architecture at the Royal Academy. He specialised in the neoclassical style of design and his architectural works are distinguished by their clean lines,  decisive detailing, careful proportions and skilful use of light. The influence of his work, coming at the end of the Georgian era, was swamped by the revival styles of the 19th century. It was not until the late 19th century that his influence was widely felt. His best-known work was the Bank of England, a building which had a widespread effect on commercial architecture. He also designed Dulwich Picture Gallery, which, with its top-lit galleries, was a major influence on the planning of subsequent art galleries and museums. His main legacy is Sir John Soane's Museum, in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London. He received a knighthood in 1831, six years before his death at the age of 84. London-based art dealer Edward Strachan attempted to buy Piercefield when it was put up for sale two years ago, offering £1million. The offer was rejected - and adding £300,000 to his bid made no difference. The Reubens declined to comment on the matter. Now, the house is firmly on the radar of a conservation group which is determined to save the Grade II*-listed building from further decay. Campaigners from Save Britain's Heritage are hoping to acquire a CPO (Compulsory Purchase Order) or possibly turn the house over to a trust. Marcus Binney, co-founder and . president of Save told the Daily Telegraph: 'Edward's was a handsome . offer. Piercefield really is an important house. 'It's . a fine early work by Soane wrapped around an older Baroque house that . might have been by William Talman [Sir Christopher Wren's assistant], . and there's evidence the house has Tudor or even earlier origins.

A clampdown on councils seeking to impose £20,000 backdoor ‘parking taxes’ on home-owners who rent-out their driveways to motorists is to be announced today by the Government. Some town halls have seen their cash from parking charges and fines dwindle as enterprising  residents have rented out their driveways to commuters and other motorists – arguing that they are doing a public service by helping to free up already crowded streets. But in retaliation ‘bullying’ council chiefs, whose extortionate parking charges have been undercut,  have now started to threaten householders with draconian fines telling them that if they are running a commercial business from home they are in breach of planning regulations and will have to apply for a change of use for their property, say Ministers. Some town halls have seen their cash from parking charges and fines dwindle as enterprising residents have rented out their driveways to commuters and other motorists . Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles says this is a  ‘backdoor parking tax on people’s driveways and parking spaces’ and is changing the law to end such action by ‘parking bullies’. Today Mr Pickles announced that the Government will be publishing new guidance on change of use making clear ‘that the public should be able to rent a single parking space without planning permission’ provided there is no public nuisance to neighbours, or other substantive concerns. It follows the case of a Westminster woman who claimed she was threatened with a maximum £20,000 fine for breaking planning rules when she rented out her three parking spaces near Parliament. Mr Pickles announced that the Government will be publishing new guidance on the issue . The council said it only acted after neighbours complained she was causing ‘a disturbance’. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government explained: ‘Across the country, assisted by the internet ‘matching’, households are renting out their spare or unused dedicated off-street parking space in and near town centres, train stations and sports grounds. 'This provides a small income for hard-working families, and helps provide more cheap parking spaces for people to park their car, taking pressure away from on-street parking. ‘ . But the spokesman added: ’It is believed that many councils do not like this activity, as it deprives them of parking income. 'As a result they are demanding that households apply for planning permission for ""change of use"". Such a planning application fee costs £385, Councils  are threatening fines of up to £20,000 if householders do not apply.’ Personal finance experts like Martin Lewis of moneysavingexpert.com have recommended this to households as a practical way of raising and saving money and websites such as  parkatmyhouse.com have sprung up to match residents to would-be parkers. In London residents in the borugh of Merton have rented out their driveways during the tennis at Wimbledon while those in Brent have taken advantage of events at Wembley Stadium, such as the FA Cup final.  But the practice means councils can lose out on pay-and-display revenue.

This Government is standing up against the town hall parking bullies and over-zealous parking enforcement.’ The Department for Communities and Local Government is currently undertaking a review of Planning Practice Guidance, to consolidate the ‘confusing and inaccessible’ 7,000 pages of guidance. This will include new practice guidance on when planning permission is, and is not, required, including for renting out  driveways. Ministers also want to clear guidance to tackle people who may seek to flout the rules by  for example by ‘ turning their front garden into a car park.’ Moneysavingexpert.com has published a guide on how households can rent out their spare parking space, and how people can park for less. There are a number of websites which offer a ‘matching’ service between people who want to rent out their drive and hire it out. They concede that it currently is a ‘grey area’ in planning law, so highlighting the public need for clearer guidance.","Enterprising homeowners have rented out their driveways to motorists .

Whether your 'do is greasy, flat or frizzy, most women will agree that there's nothing worse than a bad hair day. But according to the latest research, women across the UK are waking up with . unruly hair at least three times during the week which adds up to twenty years worth of bad hair days in their lifetime. And each bad hair day . is resulting in females spending at least four hours and 26 minutes . feeling moody and depressed. Hair-raising: British women will suffer an . average of twenty years worth of bad hair days in their lifetime, which . makes them moody for over four hours each day . The psychological effect of a bad hair day is significant as eight out of ten British women believe their social acceptance and beauty lies in how good their hair looks. Key findings revealed that when women want to ooze self-confidence, be seductive and take on the world, it’s not the designer outfit, the killer heels or the freshly made-up face that carries them forward: over half of British women believe their inner strength lies in their locks. Hair idols: It's the bouncy, curly locks of Cheryl Cole and Holly Willoughby that most women want to copy in 2013 . The survey also revealed that sixty seven per cent of women would mess up a job interview if they were experiencing a bad hair day and sixty three per cent would cancel an important date if their hair was not looking its best. Nearly half (49 per cent) of the nation’s female workers reported they lose their self worth and do not perform to their normal standard in an important meeting or presentation if they are experiencing a bad hair day, a third of them have . even gone as far as to call in sick to avoid going into work with bad . hair. The survey by Travelodge also found that fifty two per cent of women would cancel an outing with their friends if they did not feel good about their hair. Top of the locks: Eight out of ten women believe their social acceptance and beauty lies in how good their hair looks and love the Duchess of Cambridge and Kelly Brook's locks . The study also revealed that British women tend to take their beauty cues from celebrities and a third of the UK female population currently favours big hair with bouncy curls such as the style donned by Cheryl Cole, Holly Willoughby, Kelly Brook, Kate Middleton and Kim Kardashian. Other research findings revealed that when faced with a bad hair day, thirteen per cent of women try to get away with it by wearing a hat all day, while one in ten women over-do their make-up to compensate. When it comes to being seen in public with bad hair, a third of British women would most hate their work colleagues to see them. Whilst a third of women hate the idea of friends seeing them without their usual sleek and shiny mane, a quarter of ladies don’t even want their partners see them with bad hair. Having a bad hair day has even led to one in 20 women being dumped for being so grumpy: twelve per cent of women have had huge rows with a partner simply because their barnet made them mad, while 14 per cent have been known to snap at their children.

Climate change will lock the world into more frequent and severe heatwaves in the next few decades, researchers have claimed. They say there will be a 'several-fold' increase in heatwaves up to 2040, regardless of how much carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere, but future efforts to slash pollution could stem the rise in extreme heat events later on in the century. The last decade has seen an exceptional number of extreme heatwaves around the world, hitting the U.S. in 2012, Russia in 2010, Australia in 2009, and Europe in 2003 with damaging impacts on health, the economy, agriculture and wildlife. There has been an exceptional rise in heatwaves in the past decade. This photograph shows smoke rising from shrubs and trees after a heatwave-related fire on Mitcham Common in South London this July . The soaring monthly and seasonal temperatures associated with heat waves can now largely be attributed to global warming of around 0.5C over the past 50 years, according to a study published in the Institute of Physics' journal Environmental Letters. Extreme summer heat waves in which monthly temperatures soar well above norms now cover around five per cent of the world's land, mostly in the Tropics, but also over western Europe and the Mediterranean, the researchers said. But the percentage of land experiencing summer months of extreme heat is set to double by 2020, and quadruple by 2040 to cover a fifth of the global land surface, the projections using computer climate models found. There could be a rise in dangerous forest fires such this one pictured in Spain in 2012 . Even more severe summer heatwaves will increase from being virtually non-existent today to covering around three per cent of the world's land. The increase in heatwaves takes place regardless of efforts to cut emissions in the next few decades. After 2040, the frequency of extreme heat events is affected by whether or not the world takes action to slash greenhouse gases. If there are only low emissions, the frequency of periods of extremely hot weather will remain constant after 2040. In Europe, around a fifth of summer months will record temperatures will above the seasonal norms, though the most extreme heatwaves will be essentially absent, the scientists said. But with high emissions of carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere, heatwaves will continue to increase, and by 2100 monthly heat extremes will cover around 85 per cent of the world's land area and very severe heat events will occur over 60 per cent of the land. The study's lead author Dim Coumou, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said: 'We find that up until 2040, the frequency of monthly heat extremes will increase several fold, independent of the emissions scenario we choose to take. 'Mitigation can, however, strongly reduce the number of extremes in the second half of the 21st century.' He said that a good example of the extreme heatwaves the world is facing were the conditions in Russia in 2010 where the average temperature around Moscow in July was 7C above normal at around 25C (77F). In some places temperatures soared to 40C (104F). 'Heat extremes can be very damaging to society and ecosystems, often causing heat-related deaths, forest fires or losses to agricultural production. 'So an increase in frequency is likely to pose serious challenges to society and some regions will have to adapt to more frequent and more severe heat waves already in the near-term,' he said. Climate change may have driven the collapse of civilisations more than 3,000 years ago, according to a new study. Researchers say once-flourishing Late Bronze Age Eastern Mediterranean cultures suffered wars and famine towards the end of the 13th Century BC fuelled by climate change. Ancient civilisations flourished in regions of the Eastern Mediterranean such as Greece, Syria and neighbouring areas, but suffered severe crises that led to their collapse during the late Bronze Age. In the new study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, Doctor David Kaniewski, of the University of Paul Sabatier in France, and colleagues from other institutions, studied pollen grains derived from sediments of an ancient lake in the region to uncover a history of environmental changes that likely drove this crisis. Shifts in carbon isotopes in the Eastern Mediterranean and in local plant species suggest that this lake was once a flourishing harbour that gradually dried into a land-locked salt lake. Dr Kaniewski said, as a result, crop failures led to famines, repeated invasions by migrants from neighbouring regions and eventually, the political and economic collapse of the Eastern Mediterranean civilisations at the end of the late Bronze Age. Combining this data with archaeological evidence from cuneiform tablets and correspondence between kings, the researchers suggest that the late Bronze Age crisis was a complex, single event comprised of climate change-induced drought, famines, sea-borne invasions and political struggles, rather than a series of unrelated events. Dr Kaniewski said: 'This event underlines the sensitivity of these agriculture-based societies to climate, and demystifies the crisis that led to their end.'","The last decade has seen a number of extreme heatwaves around the world -  the U.S. in 2012, .

Neanderthals may have invented specialised bone tools and passed their know-how on to the ancestors of modern humans, research suggests. The discovery adds to growing evidence that the Neanderthals, once viewed as dim-witted and primitive, had a high level of technological ability. Scientists found the 50,000-year-old tools from two neighbouring sites in south-west France. Neanderthals may have invented specialised bone tools and passed their know-how on to the ancestors of modern humans. The discovery adds to growing evidence that the Neanderthals, (a model is pictured) once viewed as dim-witted and primitive, had a high level of technological ability . Made from deer ribs, they are similar to the bone lissoirs or smoothers, still used by leather workers. The implements have a polished tip that, when pushed against a hide, creates softer and more water resistant leather. The excavated tools are similar to others found at sites occupied by early modern humans at a later stage, who replaced Neanderthals in Europe around 40,000 years ago. 'If Neanderthals developed this type of bone tool on their own, it is possible that modern humans then acquired this technology from Neanderthals,' said Dr Marie Soressi, one of the researchers from Leiden University in the Netherlands. 'Modern humans seem to have entered Europe with pointed bone tools only, and soon after started to make lissoirs. Made from deer ribs, the tools are similar to the bone smoothers, still used by leather workers. The excavated tools are also similar to others found at sites occupied by early modern humans (illustrated) at a later stage, who replaced Neanderthals in Europe around 40,000 years ago . 'This is the first possible evidence for transmission from Neanderthals to our direct ancestors.' Another possibility is that early modern humans started influencing Neanderthal behaviour earlier than has been thought, said the scientists writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Neanderthals were genetically different from early modern humans but may have been closely enough related to interbreed. They were eventually driven to extinction because they could not compete with the superior technology and social organisation of our direct ancestors, experts believe.","Dutch scientists found the 50,000-year-old tools in south-west France .

Silvio Berlusconi committed fraud at his media empire even when he served as prime minister of Italy, a judge has ruled. The three time Italian premier, 76, was involved in fraud ‘for many years’ and ‘continued despite the public roles assumed.' He conducted it ‘in the highest possible positions’, an explanation published today for a judgement upholding Berlusconi’s conviction for tax fraud said. The billionaire politician, who made an extraordinary comeback to take second place in February’s elections, was last October sentenced to four years in jail for his part in deals for TV rights bought by his Mediaset network. His centre right party is now back in government as part of a coalition. There was both oral and written evidence that Berlusconi ‘directly managed the first stages of an ‘enormous tax evasion’ scam using offshore companies, the judgement said. Berlusconi claims that he was not party to any of the fraudulent film-rights deals as he was too busy in his political role. But in the explanation judges said it was obvious Berlusconi 'remained interested and involved in management decisions, while abandoning the day-to-day operations.' The one-time Italian leader is set to appeal against the ruling, which also bars him from holding public office for five years. In Italy sentences for non-violent crimes do not usually take effect until the appeals system has been exhausted. But, even if his conviction is upheld by . the Supreme Court, the centre right leader is, at 76, too old to go to . jail in Italy, where over 70s usually serve time under house arrest. At 76, Silvio Berlusconi, pictured last month, is too old to go to jail, despite the ruling that he committed fraud . The ex-premier is also facing a six-year sentence for allegedly paying for sex with an minor in a trial in which the verdict is due next month. He is also appealing a one-year term for involvement in the publishing an illegal wiretap and accused of paying a Senator to cross benches to bring down the government when in opposition. Berlusconi has always denied wrongdoing, and says he is the victim of a left wing political conspiracy among the judiciary. He is attempting to secure a nomination as a life-Senator which would give him political immunity.","Silvio Berlusconi committed fraud while running his media company .

But, incredibly, instead of becoming lunch it was allowed to bask in the hot South Carolina sun on the back of one of the predators. The amazing picture was taken by photographer Mac Stone, who had to set up an intricate camera rig to capture the creatures in their natural habitat. Unlikely alliance: Instead of eating the turtle the alligator allows it to sit on its back as they bask in the river . Mr Stone spent four months in the stifling heat of the Francis Beidler Forest tracking the animals. But he was unable to get the picture he wanted because the shy creatures would sink into the water when he appeared. So the photographer built a rig on the log to allow him to catch the animals behaving naturally. The high-tech camera took a picture every five minutes over two weeks so the alligators and turtles could go undisturbed. It was only when Mr Stone went through the images that he realised he had caught the rare image. Mr Stone said: 'I was actually . nowhere in sight during this photo. I tried for nearly a month to make . photos of this behaviour but had no luck because the alligators and . turtles would just slide off into the water anytime I came near. On the run: The turtle looked in trouble when it was caught on the same log as the alligator in South Carolina .

'Every morning, I would paddle out to the log and set up the camera and then return in the evening to retrieve the camera. 'The gators and turtles didn't mind the camera and continued to clamour for space on the prime basking spot in the swamp.

An illegal immigrant who wants to serve in the military might seem an odd choice for a major national ad campaign. But young Mexican-born Alejandro Morales seemed perfect to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who picked him as the face of an ad pushing for immigration reform. Zuckerberg now plans to run the video, entitled 'Serve', on cable outlets, the internet and in 13 major TV broadcast markets across the U.S. Scroll down for video . Dreamer: Alejandro Morales, a young undocumented immigrant who was brought to the U.S. when he was seven months old, is to front Zuckerberg's ad campaign . The ad be backed up by a 'mid-six-figure ad buy,' a source close to the group told ABC News. The pitch is part of the tech . industry-backed FWD.us, a political action committee co-founded by the 29-year-old billionaire owner of the social network site that is devoted . to immigration issues. It is the first to focus on the fight waged by 'Dreamers' for . immigration reform. Its star, Morales, came to the United States illegally with his parents when he was seven months old and settled in Chicago. He served in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, or ROTC, in high school and earned the high ranking of Cadet Brigadier General during his senior year. He cannot serve in the military, however, because of his immigration status. 'I do want to give back. I believe 100 percent in what this country stands for,"" Morales says in the ad. ""Let me earn it. Let me serve.' 'We are running this ad to put a very human face on our broken immigration system,' said FWD.us President Joe Green, who co-founded FWD.us with Zuckerberg, in a statement. 'We hope that by showing Americans the cost of this broken system and the contributions people like Alejandro are already making, they will join with us in supporting real reform.' Worthy: 'Serve', the advert highlighting Morales's story, is said to have cost a six-figure sum . Motivated: Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, co-founded the national campaign for immigration reform Fwd.us . Honour: The video describes how Morales became the highest ranking cadet in Chicago JROTC and wants to serve his county in the U.S. Marines . Justice: The campaign is seeking to change immigration laws in the U.S. to give long-term residents more rights . Noble: 'Serve' highlights how the Mexican-born soldier has already been decorated for services to the U.S. military . Opportunity: 'I just want a chance to show everyone out there that I am American', says Morales in the video . The ad strikes a notably different tone from . other ads backed by FWD.us. The political advocacy group was embroiled . in controversy earlier this year when it funded ads that touted the . conservative bona fides of senators that support immigration reform, . including Senators Lindsey Graham, Mark Begich and . Marco Rubio. The ad for Graham lauded his support of . the Keystone XL pipeline, while the ad for Begich highlighted his . support for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve. The ad will run in TV broadcast markets in border states and large cities, such as Phoenix, Chicago and Washington, D.C. The controversial ads prompted protests from environmentalists and progressive groups, who temporarily boycotted purchasing ads on Facebook. Elon Musk, CEO of electric car maker Tesla, publicly quit FWD.us after the ads ran. FWD.us, which has an A-list of tech donors, including Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, has recently expanded its push for immigration reform beyond the tech industry's fight for more high-skilled visas and green cards for foreign graduates of American universities. Earlier this week, it teamed up with journalist Jose Antonio Vargas's immigrant rights group Define American to cohost the premiere of 'Documented,' a film directed by Vargas that tells the stories of 'Dreamers' like himself who are fighting to gain U.S. citizenship. Zuckerberg gave remarks at the film's premiere in San Francisco, which drew a crowd of tech executives, including Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Groupon founder Andrew Mason. Wearing . his trademark hoodie and sneakers, he disputed the notion that . he and other Silicon Valley leaders are just trying to secure more H1B . visas for high-tech workers. 'This is something that we believe is really important for the future of our country - and for us to do what's right,' Zuckerberg told several hundred attendees, including House Minority . Leader Nancy Pelosi and San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, at the Yerba Buena . Center for the Arts. Defence: Zuckerberg first spoke publicly in San Francisco at the debut screening of 'Documented,' an autobiographical documentary by activist and journalist Jose Antonio Vargas, right . Zuckerberg . and his former Harvard University roommate Joe Green recently founded . the organization Fwd.us to advocate for a pathway to citizenship for . nearly 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. The screening was the first time Zuckerberg spoke about the issue in public. The . Facebook Inc. founder said he first became aware of the need to change . the immigration system while volunteering to teach a class on . entrepreneurship at a Menlo Park school. Many of the students had been . brought into the U.S. illegally. 'No . matter where they were born, (these students) are going to be . tomorrow's entrepreneurs and people creating jobs in this country,' he told the audience. 'These are issues that don't just touch our part of the industry, but really touch a whole country.' In April, Zuckerberg teamed up with other Silicon Valley leaders to launch Fwd.us, with the aim of revamping immigration policy, boosting education and encouraging investment in scientific research. Website: Fwd.us, Zuckerberg said, was created 'to build . the knowledge economy the United States needs to ensure more jobs, . innovation and investment'. 'My great-grandparents came through Ellis Island. 'My grandfathers were a mailman and a police officer. 'My parents are doctors. I started a company. 'None of this could have happened without a welcoming immigration policy, a great education system and the world’s leading scientific community that created the internet.' In an op-ed article in The Washington Post at . the time, Zuckerberg said the U.S. needs a new approach to these issues . if it is to get ahead economically. This, he wrote, includes offering . talented, skilled immigrants a path to citizenship. 'We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants, Zuckerberg wrote. 'And it's a policy unfit for today's world.' Of . Jewish extraction, Zuckerberg's interest in immigration stems from the . fact that his own great-grandparents arrived as immigrants via Ellis . Island, to America, coupled with his experience teaching . entrepreneurship at an after-school program. At the top of the Fwd.us website it explains in bite-sized facts just why immigration is important to the future of America and reminds users that: '40 per cent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children' and that '57% of engineering grad students are immigrants. Many will have to leave if we don’t pass comprehensive immigration reform.' Zuckerberg also called for higher standards and accountability in schools and increased focus on learning about science, technology, engineering and maths. Today's knowledge and ideas-based economy, the 28-year-old Harvard dropout wrote, is very different from the economy of the 20th century that was based on natural resources, industrial machines and labor. Fwd.us, he said, was created 'to build the knowledge economy the United States needs to ensure more jobs, innovation and investment.' Also backing the group are tech leaders such as Bill Gates, LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman, serial entrepreneur Sean Parker, as well as Ruchi Sanghvi of Dropbox, who was Facebook's first female engineer.

The amount of rubbish each of us recycled went down last year for the first time in three decades. The setback follows three years in which the growth in household rubbish recycling had slowed to  a crawl. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs revealed that in the past year the amount of recycled material produced by the average individual in England actually fell, from 186kg (410lb) per person to 185kg (407.8lb). After three years in which the growth in household rubbish recycling had slowed to a crawl, the amount of rubbish each of us recycled went down last year for the first time in three decades . No similar fall has been recorded since the early 1980s. The amount recycled by each individual more than doubled between 2004 – when fortnightly bin collections were introduced – and 2011. The department admitted earlier this year that published recycling figures are already ‘overestimates’ as a high proportion of material is too contaminated to be used. Instead the rejected rubbish is sent to landfill or incinerators. Between 2004 and 2010 recycling rates in England more than doubled, from 17.8 per cent of all the household waste collected to 39.7 per cent. The improvement from 2010 to 2012 was much slower, raising the recycling rate to 43 per cent. Much of this improvement has been caused by the reduction in the amount of rubbish left out, a result of council restrictions on collections. Defra admitted earlier this year that published recycling figures were 'overestimates' as a high proportion of material is too contaminated to be used . The amount of household waste collected in England, including recycling material, has fallen from 25.7million tons in 2005 to 22.9million last year. Total weight of recycling material collected from homes went up by just 1.25 per cent in the 12 months to March 2012, from 9.7 million tonnes to 9.8 million tonnes.

Ed Miliband yesterday called on Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to investigate Mr Crosby’s influence within Government. During angry clashes in the Commons, the Labour leader called Mr Cameron the ‘Prime Minister for Benson and Hedge Funds’ – a reference to Mr Crosby’s alleged role in the ditching of Government plans to force tobacco firms to sell cigarettes in plain packets. It had been thought Mr Crosby would be forced to name his clients under legislation on lobbying which was finally published yesterday. The Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trades Union Administration Bill will introduce a statutory register of lobbyists and their clients, with firms forced to name the clients they represent in talks with ministers and officials.

But both he and Downing Street refused to say if the Prime Minister had discussed the issues with Mr Crosby before agreeing the U-turns. Number 10 also refused to name  Mr Crosby’s clients, or to confirm whether Mr Cameron knows who they are.

Mr Miliband asked Sir Jeremy to investigate whether Mr Cameron had breached the ministerial code, which bans any activity which might be seen as a conflict of interest. He said the employment of Mr Crosby, whose clients have included tobacco giant Philip Morris, as an adviser to the Tory Party created ‘a back-door breach’ of the code.

Keeping your goldfish in a tank which contains plants and sculptures could make them cleverer, according to new American research. Scientists at Penn State University, in Pennsylvania, discovered that fish benefit from being in ‘enriched environments’. They believe that their discovery could provide an insight into how to successfully repopulate our oceans and rivers. Fish kept in tanks with hiding places and floating artificial plants showed signs of improved brain function and could better navigate mazes than the those in a less exciting environment . Professor Victoria Braithwaite explained that currently a lot of fish that are bred in captivity do not survive once they are released into the wild. She said that, now, fisheries overcome this problem by breeding huge numbers of fish in the hope that some will survive. The professor believes that part of the reason so many of the fish die is that they are bred in ‘pretty boring’ tanks where there is always plenty of food and no predators meaning that they are totally unprepared for release. To test this hypothesis Braithwaite bred 30 salmon in two separate tanks. One contained plants and rocks which were regularly changed to ensure the fish did not become bored, while the other was empty. Conservation fish hatcheries are good at rearing lots of fish, but their survivability rate is low. Victoria Braithwaite, professor of fisheries and biology, Penn State, said that adding objects to make hatchery tanks more stimulating for the fish can make fish smarter and better adapted to survive in the wild . In contrast, Braithwaite said the hatchery world is homogenous: ‘The water flow is the same, you don't have to find your food and you don't have to avoid predators.’ Researchers discovered when fish were raised in the enriched tank, parts of their brains changed and they could escape from a maze quicker than fish raised in standard tanks . When the researchers placed the salmon in a maze, the fish raised in the enriched tanks made fewer mistakes when trying to escape the maze. The performance of the salmon from the enriched tank continued to improve with each trial, and they learned to solve the maze much faster than fish reared the standard way. The brains of the fish from the enriched tank were also different from the fish raised in the standard hatchery tanks, according to the researchers. They noted increased expressions of a gene in a region of the fish's brain that is associated with learning and memory, an indication of increased brain function and growth. Braithwaite has concluded that interacting with the environment can influence gene expression in the brain. ‘If you want to make the environment more interesting for your fish, change things around a bit,’ she told The Times. ‘If you are a hobby aquarist, bring in some new ornaments for the tank.’","U.S. study suggests fish in more stimulating environments are smarter .

A woman was later found dead in a nearby home, and a second woman was found wounded in another home, Police Chief Robert White said. Police said Daniel Abeyta, 31, was being held for investigation of charges including murder. The shooting victim has been identified as Sandy Roskelly, but no motive was evident. The wounded woman was reported to be Abeyta's ex-wife, according to KDVR. Shot dead: Sandy Roskelly has been confirmed as the victim of Friday's shooting in Denver . Police said Abeyta was in critical condition, his ex-wife is in serious condition. White said the man had two or three propane tanks with gunpowder on top and had placed them in the middle of the street. He said the man fired at one of them and it ""activated,"" but no one was injured. Before he was shot, the man was seen walking with his weapons. Police alerted residents to stay inside and a high school was put on lockdown. Abeyta was shot within about a half hour of that warning.

After a prank pulled by Banksy got a homeless man kicked out of his longtime home in a Los Angeles water tank, the secretive British street artist made amends by giving the man enough money to live for a full year. The trouble began after Banksy turned Tachowa Covington’s makeshift Pacific Coast Highway home into a piece of art by spray painting along the side of the bus-sized tank ‘This looks a bit like an elephant’ and it only got worse when collectors who covet the elusive artist’s work bought Covington’s squat to sell to collectors. Though Banksy painted the joke on the homeless man’s home with its occupant’s approval, it left him without a roof over his head. Now, it has been revealed just how swiftly Banksy made amends with Covington and the high regard in which he now holds the controversial artist. Scroll down for videos . Accident: When elusive street artist Banksy made a visual joke on this Los Angeles water tank, he inadvertently got a homeless man kicked out of his home of seven years . ‘There ain’t no better man than Banksy,’ Covington told The Independent. ‘He was an angel to me. He helped me more than anybody helped me in my life.’ Covington, 54, has lived an eccentric life. He once made money by wearing a suit of armor and Rollerblading around Venice Beach to entertain tourists. He’s also, at various times, worked as a Michael Jackson Impersonator, choreographer, Chippendales dancer, and male escort. ‘Most of my life I’ve been a performer,’ Covington said. ‘I never had a real job.’ Covington has lived without what most people call a home for many years, since after what he calls a string of bad relationships. Tank man: Covington sits in his extraordinary tank home, which in its prime featured an electricity generator, television, an address and even mail service . Homeless again: Tachowa Covington made the abandoned bus-sized water tank his home with electricity and even mail service and a television (pictured) On his throne: Covington spent seven years working on his tank before Banksy's influence, and his art world adulation, pulled the red carpet out from under Covington . While living on a hillside above a stretch of Pacific Coast Highway between Santa Monica and Malibu, Covington noticed a water tank being abandoned. It was initially park of a failed effort to build a park. ‘I watched it for a month or so,’ Covington said. ‘Eventually, I climbed inside and saw that it was empty. I thought, “Wow. This would be a cool place to make a house.”’ So for years, that’s what he called the metal tank. He refinished the inside with discarded building materials found in the surrounding affluent beachside neighborhoods and became a staple in the area. Homeless again: Covington perches atop his tank just before it was removed in 2011. After Banksy spray painted his joke on the tank, an art collector purchased it and hauled it away, leaving Covington homeless again . Police left him alone despite neighbor complaints. In its heyday, Covington’s tank had a generator, television, security camera, and its own address complete with mail service. Then, one day in 2011, he heard some people outside. ‘I looked out of the hatch, and there were two guys there,’ he said. The guys said they were making a joke as they spray-painted the vaguely elephant-shaped tank. Covington didn’t stop them, he thought it was funny, too. Eccentric: Covington says he has always been a performer and at various times has worked as a Michael Jackson impersonator, a male escort, and armor-clad rollerblader . ‘This looks a bit like an elephant,’ the tank now read. One of the men introduced himself as Banksy. ‘I didn’t know who he was, so I didn’t think twice about it,’ said the oblivious Covington. Unfortunately, other people weren’t quite as out of the loop and news quickly spread about the secretive graffiti artist’s Los Angeles cameo piece. Soon after, an LA-based art organization bought the tank and not long after that, they hauled it away. Covington was devastated. Like an elephant: A regretful Banksy gave Covington enough money to live for a year. He says he'll never forget what the artist did for him. 'There ain¿t no better man than Banksy' But before Covington had a single day to despair, Banksy righted his wrong. 'He helped me so fast': Covington says he'd never been treated as nicely by anyone before Banksy. 'It was like a miracle' Back on his feet: Though the money from Banksy has run out and Covington is back living on the hill sans tank, he's now on a waiting list for government-funded housing . ‘He helped me so fast, I didn’t have . to spend a single day more on the streets,’ Covington told the . Independent. ‘It was like a miracle.’ Banksy gave him money to get settled in an apartment and pay bills for a year. Though . that  money has now run out, Covington continues to think highly of the . artist and has even decided to revisit his glory days as Rollerball, . the skating armored man. Since . his eviction, Covington has also become the subject of a what some some . Texas-based filmmakers hope will become a documentary on his unwitting . role in the world of high art called Something from Nothing. And this week, a play based on Covington and his elephant tank called Banksy: The Room in the Elephant begins a run at the UK's Edinburgh this Wednesday.","Tachowa Covington lived in an water tank for seven years before Banksy used it as a joke and caught the attention of covetous art collectors .

Mike Weatherley was targeted after he urged David Cameron to take action against Russia's anti-gay laws . A Conservative MP has received a death threat on Twitter after he appealed to David Cameron to speak out against Russia’s anti-gay legislation. Mike Weatherley, the MP for Hove and Portslade, East Sussex, wrote to Mr Cameron to say that Britain 'has a duty not to stay silent' over anti-gay laws passed in the lead up to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. He received the message: 'Kill Weatherley' from a twitter user with almost 1,500 followers. Mr Weatherley said: 'Twitter trolls cannot be allowed to hide behind their computers when making threats like this. 'There is absolutely no way that I . will allow this intimidating kind of behaviour to change my stance on . this matter, as I will continue to stand up for gay rights both in . Russia and around the world.' The MP’s office said the tweet has now been reported to Sussex Police, who are investigating the source of the message. The controversy in Russia was sparked after politicians in its lower house of parliament, the Duma, passed a law imposing heavy fines for providing information about homosexuality to people under 18. It led to broadcaster Stephen Fry writing an open letter urging Mr Cameron to support moves to strip Russia of the Winter Olympics. The threat against Mr Weatherley also comes after Twitter UK general manager Tony Wang posted a series of tweets recently saying abuse was 'simply not acceptable' on the site. His messages came after the website clarified its rules on abusive behaviour amid a growing backlash over a series of attacks, including against a number of high-profile women. These have included television classicist Mary Beard, Labour MP Stella Creasy and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez.

Ms Omran began training when she was 18 and has now qualified as a junior doctor at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. Ms Omran, from Lenton, Nottingham, said: ‘My nana adored me when I was a child and was always taking me out and about. ‘There were warning signs when I was younger but when I was about four they got a proper diagnosis. ‘From then I wasn't left with my nana so often because she was putting herself at risk with the things she'd do. ‘She accidentally set herself alight while she was in her pyjamas and she was forgetful. ‘I would visit her as much as I could as I got older and spent a lot of my childhood in hospitals.

UKIP treasurer Stuart Wheeler said he had held 'secret lunches' with Tory MPs to discuss switching parties . Eight Tory MPs are in talks about defecting to the UK Independence Party, its millionaire treasurer has claimed. A series of 'secret lunches' have been held by Stuart Wheeler, a former Conservative donor now trying to coax MPs to join UKIP. The revelation comes as the two parties continue a war of words over a mooted electoral pact and the fall-out from the decision by Rotherham council to remove three foster children from a couple because they were UKIP members. Mr Wheeler, a spread-betting tycoon, . said he had agreed to keep the MPs' names secret but had passed on their . details to UKIP leader Nigel Farage. ‘I . have had lunch, secretly if you like, in a completely confidential way . with eight different Tory MPs,' he told the Daily Telegraph. While still . early days, he predicted ‘a few’ could switch parties. It follows a furious row between the two parties over the idea of forming an electoral pact at the next election. Conservative Party vice-chairman . Michael Fabricant had urged the Premier to strike a deal with UKIP, . arguing it could help the Tories pick up 20 seats at the next election. But . party chairman Grant Shapps moved to kill off the idea, saying the . party would 'categorically' not do a deal with the smaller party. And . UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he would only consider a deal if the . Tories ousted Mr Cameron as leader. His party has been angered by Mr . Cameron's decision to reignite a row about comments he made in 2006 in . which he described the party's members as 'fruitcakes, loonies and . closet racists, mostly'. Mr . Farage said: 'If Cameron went and somebody pragmatic, grown up and . sensible like Michael Gove was leader, you might think then we could sit . around the table and have a proper discussion. 'It's . very difficult for us to believe anything David Cameron says because, . after all, he gave us a cast-iron guarantee that we'd have a referendum . [on the Lisbon Treaty] and it hasn't happened.' Tory party chairman Grant Shapps (left) put and end to the idea floated by vice-chairman Michael Fabricant (right) that the Conservatives should join forces with UKIP . Mr Fabricant had warned that UKIP had . become 'a significant contributory factor in costing the Conservative . Party victories in marginal seats'. But he sparked controversy after suggesting that some Tories were racist while trying to defend his pact idea. Challenged over Mr Cameron's claim in . 2006 that UKIP was made up of mostly 'loonies, fruitcakes and closet . racists', Mr Fabricant said: 'The truth is, some UKIP members are. I’m . going to be very controversial now and say some Conservative members . might well be, and some Labour members and some Lib Dem members.' 'It's war': UKIP leader Nigel Farage has refused to consider a new deal unless the Tories get rid of David Cameron . Mr Fabricant showed that the party's . votes were the difference between Tories winning and losing more than 20 . seats at the last election. Under his proposal, the Tories were to . offer a referendum on Europe and give Mr Farage a job in government. In . return UKIP would agree not to field candidates against the Tories at . the next election. But Mr Shapps said: 'I want to win the next election outright of course for the Conservatives so that we have an outright majority and don't have to be in coalition. But I want to do that with Conservative candidates fighting and winning on their own ground and on their terms and that is exactly what we are going to do.' Mr Farage said there would be 'no deals with the Tories – it's war. 'UKIP is not a racist party and yet Mr Cameron, the Prime Minister, basically repeated his unpleasant allegation that he made about us in 2006. 'So the real obstacle to any deal with the Conservative Party is the Conservative Party leader.' Mr Fabricant played down the row, suggesting there were 'closet racists' in all parties. A poll has revealed a majority in favour of Britain leaving the EU. The ComRes survey for the Independent found 54 per cent agree 'Britain should leave the EU but maintain close trading links', while 36 per cent disagree. Some 61 per cent of Tory supporters agreed.","UKIP treasurer Stuart Wheeler reveals talks to persuade Conservatives to switch parties .

No mission is too much for former KGB spy turned strongman leader Vladimir Putin as he sets off on his latest bid to put right the wrongs of nature by teaching birds to fly. Hang-gliding over Arctic Siberia this week, the all-Russian action man guided white cranes which seem to have lost the instinct to migrate south to a warmer climate for the winter. The aim was to set the endangered birds on course for Asia and  as with his previous action-man ventures - which included sedating a tiger, tagging a white whale, and offering tender loving care and a tracking collar to a polar bear - the Kremlin announced total success. Scroll down for video . Fly away home: Russian President Vladimir Putin flies in a motorized deltaplane to lead young Siberian cranes on their migration path . As opposition groups and bloggers mercilessly mocked his flying lesson for birds, Putin's PR machine made clear that after a false start all five juvenile cranes had followed the lead bird - the Russian president dressed in flapping white overalls - and flown for the required distance. It is hoped the cranes will now fly from Kushavet ornithological research station to Tyumen, further south in Siberia, before taking off for middle Asia and a warm winter. 'For cranes, the parent is a man in a white robe,' explained Yuri Markin, the director of the game reserve.  'They don't remember a particular person. They remember the white robe and hood, or on the ultralight, a white helmet - and a special beak that is worn on the head.' Nice suit Mr President: Putin kitted up for the flight in a baggy white outfit, gloves and goggles - but sadly no beak . Watch the birdie: Putin keeps a careful eye on one of the cranes while waiting in a motorized hang-glider . Pictures do not show Putin wearing the beak, probably to avoid yet more vilification from his foes, on the three motorised hang gliding flights he made on the remote on the Yamal Peninsula in the Arctic. 'It is amazing how the birds get used to it,' Putin told state television  still dressed in his pilot's outfit of helmet and goggles. 'They do not fear the hang-glider and they overtook it. They are amazing. It's a very good feeling.' He has been preparing for 18 months, he said, and ahead of the crane-flight he clocked up 17 hours flying the hang glider. Instant fame: The three-month-old Siberian cranes got their moment of TV glory . Preparing for take-off: Putin (front) sits in the motorized glider at the Kushevat ornithological station, near the city of Salekhard . Nervous flyer? Putin made three trips in the glider, the first to get familiar with its workings, and two others with the birds . As the cranes - hopefully - head south on their own, jokes were flying round the Russian web today as one former Putin spin doctor branded this a stunt too far. 'Bad publicity,' said Gelb Pavolvsky. One cartoon showed Putin wearing cardboard wings telling the resentful looking cranes: 'Let's assign roles right now. I'll be the alpha crane!'. Another had Putin telling the cranes: 'I will save you'. One crane responded: 'Maybe I'd better die out.' Back on terra firma: Putin (2nd L) talks with an ornithologist after the successful flights . The many faces of Putin: The Russian president is keen to cultivate a hard-man image, but also to present himself as a simple nature-lover . A mock-up picture showed a bare-chested Putin in sun glasses flying on a crane. The 59 year old president as  'Mother Hen' and opposition leader Alexei Navalny sneered: ""About Stalin they said 'In the night, a light will burn in the window.' And of Putin they will say: 'He flew over our homes with a flock of cranes.' One Twitter post  said: 'For the flock to recognise him as a leader, he stuffed three feathers in his rear.' Among his other memorable macho stunts was a scuba dive for fragments of ancient Greek amphorae. Later his spokesman  Dmitry Peskov  admitted the artifacts had been planted on the sea floor for Putin to grab. Animal welfare: Mr Putin has already examined a tranquilised polar bear in the wild (left) and has now turned his attention to the plight of the Siberian white crane (right) Action man: Mr Putin's other high-profile stunts have included posing bare chested with a rifle . Some opponents say humour is the wrong reaction, claiming his stunts are part of the establishment of a cult of personality lionizing an authoritarian leader. One victim of the crane flight was Masha Gessen, author of a book critical of Putin. She appeared to have been fired from her post as editor of travel and science magazine Vokrug Sveta (Around the World) after refusing to send a reporter 2,200 miles northwest of Moscow to cover the event. The magazine said  she left by agreement following ""differences"" with the publishers. Like the cranes, Putin also went on to engage with Asia. His adventure came en route to  host the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vladivostok, attended by US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and leaders of 21 countries. Over-exposed? Mr Putin has also been photographed posing bare chested with a horse in the past . Opposition: Not all Russians have appreciated Mr Putin's stunts, such as horseback riding (left).

The broadcaster, writing in an open letter on his website, compared the situation to the decision to hold the 1936 games in Nazi Germany and said President Vladimir Putin 'is making scapegoats of gay people'. He said: 'An absolute ban on the Russian Winter Olympics of 2014 on Sochi is simply essential. Outrage: Stephen Fry has urged David Cameron to support moves to strip Russia of the 2014 Winter Olympics . Stage them elsewhere in Utah, Lillehammer, anywhere you like. At all costs Putin cannot be seen to have the approval of the civilised world.' In the letter, which was also sent to London 2012 supremo Lord Coe and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Fry said: 'The Summer Olympics of 2012 were one of the most glorious moments of my life and the life of my country. 'For there to be a Russian Winter Olympics would stain the movement forever and wipe away any of that glory.' The broadcaster said President Vladimir Putin 'is making scapegoats of gay people' Addressing the Prime Minister directly, Fry said he was 'a man for whom I have the utmost respect.' He added: 'As the leader of a party I have for almost all of my life opposed and instinctively disliked, you showed a determined, passionate and clearly honest commitment to LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) rights and helped pushed gay marriage through both houses of our parliament in the teeth of vehement opposition from so many of your own side. For that I will always admire you, whatever other differences may lie between us. In the end I believe you know when a thing is wrong or right. Please act on that instinct now.' It comes after politicians in Russia's lower house of parliament, the Duma, passed a law imposing heavy fines for providing information about homosexuality to people under 18. Last month, the IOC said it would 'work to ensure that the Games can take place without discrimination against athletes, officials, spectators and the media'. It said: 'To that end, the IOC has received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games.'","The broadcaster compared the situation to the decision to hold the 1936 games in Nazi Germany .
