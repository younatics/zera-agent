"The plugin, from San Francisco-based firm Streak, lets senders see when their emails have been opened and the reader's location, pictured . If 'read receipts' on emails weren't annoying enough, a San Francisco-based firm has taken the art of tracking emails to the next level. The Streak plugin lets Gmail account holders monitor which of their sent items have been opened, who opened them, the exact time they were opened and how many times those emails have been viewed since. It also reveals details about the device used to read the email, and even the reader's approximate location. Streak is aimed at sales and marketing professionals, and the company calls it a 'Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) in your inbox.' However, the plugin can be installed by anyone using Gmail on Google Chrome and Safari. Aside from tracking emails, the plugin can also track stories and keywords, and keep track of bookings made as . part of a wedding or other event. Once installed, users can set Streak's Email Tracking function to be enabled by default and each time they send an email, Streak will automatically track it. The feature can also be disabled at any time. When an email is read, a popup notification appears in the corner of the sender's inbox to tell them which email has been read, by whom, and on what device. An eye icon on the right-hand side of the email in the inbox will also turn green and hovering over it will reveal how many times the email has been read. Clicking this icon then opens a sidebar, and under 'more details', senders can see the exact time it was opened and the location plotted on an interactive Google map. At no point is the reader of the email informed that they have been tracked.

Meanwhile, tests carried out by PJ Vogt from OnTheMedia located the reader of his email to within about five minutes of their exact location in New York. Vogt advises that to avoid being tracked, users would need to stop images being automatically loaded in an email client. He also claims different clients offer different levels of protection. Streak only lets users track 200 emails a month for free before charging a premium for extra emails. There is also an iOS app that performs a similar task, built by a separate company. Called Mailtracker, the app lets people know when their email is being read. It also tells users details such as what platform their email was read on, how long it was read, and from what city.

"It has given Mary Berry’s career a big boost - and it seems that the Great British Bake Off may have done wonders for another old favourite, too. Industry figures show sales of butter are soaring as margarine falls out of favour. The amount of block butter sold last year was up 8.7 per cent, with a 6 per cent boost for spreadable tubs. Mary Berry has helped boost the popularity of baking, which has contributed to soaring butter sales . Experts suggested that a boom in home baking was behind the improved figures, as well as a narrowing of the price gap between butter and margarine. Stuart Ibberson of Arla Foods, whose butters Anchor and Lurpak reported the strongest growth, also suggested that shoppers ‘are moving towards more natural products, away from products such as margarine that are often packed full of additives’. The baking boom has helped sales of block butter soar 8.7 per cent last year . Indeed, sales of other spreads and margarine have fallen – with Flora among the hardest hit. Its sales dropped 7.4 per cent, partly due to a change in its recipe. Analysts claim it lost more than £24million in sales due to tweaking the spread’s formula. Last month, its makers Unilever announced that it was ditching the new-style Flora after 17 months. The company had spent £29million on improving the taste and health benefits of the spread – but is reverting to the old recipe. Shoppers said the lower fat version of . the popular margarine brand was ‘disgusting,’ complaining of an oily . consistency, artificial taste and ‘rancid’ smell, with many shoppers . saying they threw full tubs away and would not be buying it again. Magazine The Grocer says that deals . have also been important to the growth of butter and industry experts . say that price has played a key role in butter’s gains over the past . year. ‘A narrowing price gap between butter . and margarine, as well as evolving consumer habits, are key drivers . behind the margarine decline,' it was reported.

"The boss of the UK's biggest taxi firm apologised today for comparing a deaf footballer who 'grunts' during matches to female tennis players. Millionaire Addison Lee chairman and leading Tory donor John Griffin appeared to crack the joke at the expense of Potters Bar’s deaf footballer Daniel Ailey. The non-league striker was abused by Grays Athletic fans in a midweek match last month for the way he communicates with his team-mates. Anger: John Griffin, left, waded into a row about deaf footballer Daniel Ailey, right, and seemed to mock the way he communicated with team-mates . Police were called when some of the fans started making loud grunting noises mocking the way he gets the attention of his fellow players. Ailey was said to be 'very upset' about being abused on the pitch. The striker, who has one child, declined to comment directly, but his club manager Adam Lee said: 'Daniel has told me he is very upset about what has happened. 'He has been a bit more introverted over the last couple of weeks. He is going away for a long weekend with his partner and child which will do him good. 'I signed Daniel from Enfield, he is a good player. 'I am just so bored of this type of behaviour in this day and age - it is 2012 we should have moved on.' The 69-year-old mini cab boss involved in the row by sending an e-mail from his Addison Lee account to his local paper comparing the noises made by Ailey to those of female tennis stars, such as Maria Sharapova. Controversial: An e-mail sent from Addison Lee boss John Griffin to the Welwyn & Hatfield Times regarding Potters Bar's deaf striker Daniel Ailey . His comments were made public sparking anger from charities, and today he issued an apology for causing any offence. He said: 'I regret any offence caused by my comments. This was certainly not my intention and I apologise.' Sharapova has reached levels of 101 decibels, which is the equivalent of an aeroplane landing while other female tennis stars such as Serena Williams have also been accused of making a lot of noise while playing. Williams' grunt is more low pitched than Sharapova's but is still the equivalent noise level as a jackhammer, at 88.9 decibels. Mr Griffin, who lives in a luxury house in Potters Bar and is believed to be worth £50million, sent the e-mail to the Welwyn & Hatfield Times news reporter Paul Christian who reported on the original story. Making a racket: Female tennis players Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams have two of the loudest grunts in the game. Russian Sharapova has been recorded reaching 101 decibels, the same as an aeroplane landing . In the e-mail he said the police at . the ground should have ‘demanded’ the profoundly-deaf player . ‘discontinue’ the way he communicates. He also said: ‘I long ago gave up watching women’s tennis due to the loud and [un]acceptable level of grunting. 'I . note that the police were called and I hope they demanded that the . footballer should discontinue making noises that could be misinterpreted . by members of the crowd.' And . now Action on Hearing Loss has now slammed both his astonishing e-mail . and the sick taunts made by some of Grays football fans. Rebecca Griffin, the charity’s head . of PR and campaigns, said: ‘We are very disappointed by the reported . lack of deaf awareness shown by a section of the supporters and hope, in . future, they show more respect to a talented footballer who is trying . to overcome communication barriers during matches. Not happy: Potters Bar Town manager Adam Lee spoke on behalf of Daniel Ailey who expressed how upset he was . 'We . are also extremely concerned by the comments made by Mr Griffin and . expect they will be seen as a spectacular own goal by many of his . company’s customers who are deaf or hard of hearing.' Meanwhile a spokeswoman for Addison Lee said: 'Our Chairman has apologised for the comments made and for any offence that has been caused. 'Addison Lee is an equal opportunities employer and we are strongly committed to employing disabled people as is demonstrated through our membership of the 'Two Ticks' scheme.' Ailey was subjected to the taunts when he came on as a 66th minute sub during the home game on October 23, which Grays Athletic won 2-0. Police were called but left shortly afterwards when it appeared that the abuse had stopped. And Peter Waller, 61, chairman of Potter's Bar Town FC, described the abuse from the away fans as 'unacceptable'. He said: 'We are not happy at all with the behaviour on that day. The incident has gone to the FA and we hope they will deal with it seriously. This is an issue that needs to be discussed - it is unacceptable to abuse any players. 'Mr Griffin is entitled to have his say, but imagine if we had all laughed at disabled athletes at the Paralympics. 'It does not matter what noises Daniel makes on the pitch, the only important thing is that he is a good footballer.' It is not the first time that Mr Griffin has been involved in a controversy, back in April he told his drivers to break the law by using bus lanes in London. Under orders: Addison Lee drivers were told by Mr Griffin to drive in London's bus lanes - despite the fact it is illegal . The self-made top Tory donor and father-of-two also lost a money-spinning £4million Government contract the same month in a bitter cash row. Mr Griffin, who founded Addison Lee in Battersea, south London, in 1975 with one car, also infuriated the city’s tens of thousands of cyclists in April. The Private Hire Car Association chairman wrote in his in-house magazine Add Lib: ‘These cyclists are throwing themselves on to some of the most congested spaces in the world. 'They leap on to a vehicle which offers them no protection except a padded plastic hat. 'Should a motorist fail to observe a granny wobbling to avoid a pothole or rain drain, then he is guilty of failing to anticipate that this was somebody on her maiden voyage into the abyss. 'The fact is he just didn't see her and however cautious, caring or alert he is, the influx of beginner cyclists is going to lead to an overall increase in accidents involving cyclists.' Addison Lee carries a up to 10million passengers a year as well as making 1million courier deliveries.","John Griffin says he regrets comparing grunting noises made up deaf footballer Daniel Ailey to those made female tennis stars .

"The 7-year-old boy who brought in a .22-caliber handgun to a New York City public elementary school has been bullied and 'was afraid for his life,' the child's father said today. Walter Orozco said he believes his boy, Tyler, wanted the weapon for defense against schoolyard bullies. 'He was afraid for his life,'  Orozco said of his young child. 'He was afraid to go to school. The kids were picking and picking on him, but the school wouldn’t do anything to protect him.' A handgun (left), flaregun (right) and ammunition were found in the bag of a 7-year-old boy at a school in New York City . Orozo, 55, doesn't know exactly how his son got access to the small caliber weapon but thinks he got it from one of his older brothers who live in the same Far Rockaway, Queens apartment building, the New York Daily News reported. The dad said the boy's mother, Deborah Farley, had complained to the school about the bullying, 'but the school wouldn’t protect him. The school did nothing.' The second-grader brought the weapon to school in a Batman backpack. The scare, amid heightened . concern about gun violence in U.S. schools, on Thursday triggered a lockdown at Wave Preparatory Elementary School, located in Queens, for an hour, the New York City Education Department said. Farley, 53, . was charged with two counts of weapons possession, and one count each . of endangering the welfare of a child and unlawful possession of a . weapon. Also inside the child's Batman backpack were a flare gun, a magazine with 10 bullets and at least seven more rounds in a plastic bag, the New York Post said. Farley allegedly told police she had . been walking around Queens the night before and put the weapon in her . son's backpack and forgot to remove it before he went to school. Police also found seven baggies of pot in the apartment, the Post reported. Tyler and his 10-year-old sister were removed from the home. The weapon was not fired but it was . an extremely tense day at the school. 'I thought we were going to get . killed,' Javier Ferrufino, an 11-year-old student told the New York Times. 'We went to the back of the classroom. I hid with my friend behind some computers,' he added. The boy who brought the gun to school has two older half-brothers, aged 21 and 27. Police believe that the one of the brothers is involved with a gang, according to the Post. The Wave Preparatory Elementary School in Far Rockaway, Queens, was forced into lockdown for an hour on Thursday morning . In December a gunman killed 20 first-graders along with six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. On Wednesday President Barack Obama launched the biggest U.S. gun-control push in generations, urging Congress to approve an assault weapons ban and background checks for all gun buyers to prevent mass shootings like the Newtown massacre. New York state enacted the nation's toughest gun restrictions Tuesday and the first since the Connecticut school massacre, including an expanded assault-weapon ban and background checks for buying ammunition. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the measure into law less than an hour after it won final passage in the Legislature, with supporters hailing it as a model for the nation and gun-rights activists condemning it as a knee-jerk piece of legislation that won't make anyone safer and is too extreme to win support in the rest of the country. 'Common sense can win,' Cuomo said. 'You can overpower the extremists with intelligence and with reason and with common sense.' Owners of an estimated 1 million previously legal semiautomatic rifles, such as the Bushmaster model used to kill 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Conn., a month ago, will be allowed to keep their weapons but will have a year to register them with police. The sale of any more such weapons is prohibited in New York state.","Wave Preparatory Elementary School in Queens, New York City, forced into lockdown for an hour .

"A device described as the 'mother of all Swiss Army knives' has gone on display, which features more than 100 tools - including a gun. The incredible multi-tool boasts everything from a piano tuner to a .22-caliber revolver. Owned by the Smithsonian Institution and on display at the Buffalo Bill Centre of the West in Wyoming, USA, the 'handy pocket knife' is just the tool for the typical 19th century gentleman. Tooled up: With more than 100 implements, this knife would have something for every conceivable scenario . Gun: The .22 pistol can be seen here at the top of the knife, just below the scissors . Exquisite: A razor blade is extended at the bottom of the picture, next to a beautifully made pair of scissors . It includes a serrated blade, two dagger blades, several different types of shears and scissors and  a corkscrew. Other features necessary for the hardy outdoors types during the turbulent days of the Wild West, include two saws, a lancet, button hook, cigar cutter, tuning fork, pens, a mechanical pencil, mirror, straight razor, a cheese fork and a butter knife. But one modern convenience the user would have to do without is the bottle opener, because the bottle cap as we know it today wasn't invented until 1892. The exquisite craftsmanship on the . tortoise-shell handle even covers a selection of concealed miniature . tools, from folding knives and scissors to a cut throat razor. Craftmanship: The exquisite knife was meticulously designed and even includes a cheese fork . Mother of all knives: The pocket knife was made in 1880 and predates the Swiss Army Knife by 11 years . Made in Germany in 1880 for JS Holler & Co's cutlery store in New York City, the beautifully crafted knife predates the Swiss Army knife by 11 years. According the Smithsonian website the knife - which is 3.5ins wide and 9ins long - wasn't really meant to be carried. It reads: 'Knives like this were made exclusively for exhibition to highlight the cutlers' art. 'They were so difficult to make they were only attempted by the most notable firms with the most talented artisans. 'They could be seen at various fairs and industrial expositions during the 19th century.' The term 'Swiss Army Knife' came into being after US soldiers based in Germany during the Second World War had difficulty pronouncing the German name, Schweizer Offiziersmesser (Swiss Officer's Knife). Tools of the trade: Among the many implements can be seen a butter knife, saw and pliers .

"The mysterious properties of asteroids have long confounded astronomers, despite the billions spent in research. Scientists believe they the materials deep within an asteroid's core could help unlock the secrets to how planets, like Earth, form. Now a group of researchers has come one step closer to understanding these enigmatic objects by finding the first ever evidence that asteroids can have a highly varied internal structure. Scroll down for video... Scientists have found the first evidence that asteroids can have a highly varied internal structure. Pictured here is a schematic view of asteroid Itokawa. The asteroid surface has two distinct surface types: a smooth zone with a layer of sand or gravel on the surface, and a bumpy zone, covered with a great number of rocks . The discovery was made by a team of astronomers at Kent University who found that different parts of a near-Earth asteroid - called Itokawa - have different densities. Using telescope images from 2001 to 2013, Dr Stephen measured the speed peanut-shaped Itokawa spins and how its spin rate is changing over time. They combined these delicate observations with new theoretical work on how asteroids radiate heat. This provided the space scientists with a unique opportunity to explore its interior, revealing the complexity within its core and secrets about its formation. Using images taken over 12 years, astronomers at Kent University have found that different parts of a near-Earth asteroid - called Itokawa (pictured) - have different densities . The Itokawa asteroid was discovered in 1998 by the LINEAR mission. In August 2003, it was officially named after Hideo Itokawa, a Japanese rocket scientist. The asteroid surface has two distinct surface types: a smooth zone with a layer of sand or gravel on the surface, and a bumpy zone, covered with a great number of rocks. In 2000, it was selected as the target of Japan's Hayabusa mission. The probe arrived in the vicinity of Itokawa on 12 September 2005. The probe collected samples from the surface and returned them to Earth for analysis. Scientists were able to piece together the impact history of Itokawa, showing that that the asteroid had been shaped by collisions with objects ranging in size from 10 kilometers down to a nanometre. ‘This is the first time we have ever been able to determine what it is like inside an asteroid. We can see that this asteroid has a highly varied structure,’ said Dr Lowry. ‘This finding is a significant step forward in our understanding of rocky bodies in our solar system.’ The spin of an asteroid and other small bodies in space can be affected by sunlight. This phenomenon, known as the YORP effect, occurs when absorbed photons from the sun are re-emitted from the surface of the object in the form of heat. When the shape of the asteroid is very irregular the heat is not radiated evenly and this creates a tiny, but continuous, torque on the body and changes its spin rate. Dr Lowry’s team measured that the YORP effect was slowly accelerating the speed at which it spins. The change in rotation speed is tiny – only around 45 milliseconds per year - and was far from expected. Scientists suspected Itokawa’s ‘bi-lobed’ or ‘peanut-like’ appearance is the result of two bodies of very different densities, that came together at some point in its ancient history. This research is the first time that astronomers have found evidence for the highly-varied internal structure of asteroids. The Itokawa asteroid, which looks like a peanut, was discovered in 1998 by the LINEAR mission. In August 2003, it was officially named after Hideo Itokawa, a Japanese rocket scientist . Up until now, asteroid interiors could only be inferred using rough overall-density measurements. This rare glimpse into the diverse innards of asteroid Itokawa has led to much speculation regarding its formation. One possibility is that its origins lie within the catastrophic collapse of a double asteroid, also known as a binary asteroid system. ‘Finding asteroids which don’t have homogenous interiors has far-reaching implications, particularly for models of binary asteroid formation,’ said Dr Lowry. ‘It could also help with work on asteroid mitigation, or to plan future trips to these rocky bodies.’ This new ability to probe the interior of an asteroid - without the need for a visiting spacecraft with penetrating radar - is a significant step forward, and may unlock many secrets of asteroids in the future.

"Former BBC director general Mark Thompson became embroiled in a row with a TV news crew when they tried to question him about his handling of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Mr Thompson, 56, who next month faces a grilling from MPs over huge pay-offs to executives during his eight-year tenure, was confronted by a Channel 4 News team outside his luxury apartment block in New York. According to a witness, Mr Thompson – who has been chief executive of the New York Times since November – lost his temper and ‘screamed’ at the team, who pursued him along the street. Questions: Mark Thompson (left) was apparently approached about disgraced ex-BBC DJ Jimmy Savile (right) ‘He was tense and angry and was . talking very loudly.

"A woman who stunned a courtroom this week by admitting to three murders has two young daughters, the Mail can reveal today. Joanna Dennehy, 31, pleaded guilty to stabbing three men to death and trying to kill two others in a rampage of violence. The Mail has discovered she has two children she abandoned more than four years ago when she descended into a life of drink and drugs. Family: Convicted murderer Joanna Dennehy with her two girls, whose identities have been concealed . Revelation: How the Mail reported on Dennehy this Tuesday . The girls - 14 and seven - live with their father, John Treanor, 37, and their step-mother Vicky and enjoy school and spending time with friends. But their lives were turned upside down when their mother was arrested on suspicion of a triple murder earlier this year. Mr Treanor had to break the news to his eldest daughter after police came round to their house in Glossop, Derbyshire, to take statements about his time with the killer. He spent 12 years in an on-off relationship with Dennehy before finally pulling the plug on their chaotic relationship in 2009. Since then Dennehy has not tried once to visit the girls. ‘We’ve not heard a peep out of her in years,’ said Mr Treanor said. ‘My eldest daughter knew her mother had been arrested and we were all very, very shocked. She read about the murders in the papers and then she searched for it on the internet, but when she pleaded guilty this week she was devastated. ‘My youngest is only seven and I’ve chosen not to tell her about it as she is too young to understand. She doesn’t even know Jo is her mother. ‘It has been a dreadful time for us all. Just when it seemed we had got rid of their mother’s damaging influence she rears her head again. 'The girls both love school and have a circle of friends and we are trying to live a normal life. This will not help things at all.’ Lovers: Dennehy and John Teanor pose lovingly together in 2004 . Mum: Dennehy with her first daughter, who is now 14 and read about her murders in the papers . Mr Treanor decided to flee to safety with his two daughters after putting up with years of drinking, drug-taking and infidelity. The final straw came in 2009 when Dennehy, who had left the family home, turned up drunk late one evening and pulled a dagger from the inside of her knee-length leather boot. She plunged the knife, which had a decorated handle, into the living room floor and yelled, ‘I wish I could kill someone’. Terrified, Mr Treanor broke off all contact immediately and fled to safety with his children more than 140 miles away and has not seen Dennehy since. But he never imagined the angry outburst would become a dreadful reality and she would become one of the few female multiple killers in British criminal history. On Monday she pleaded guilty to brutally stabbing to death her landlord . New life: John Teanor, pictured, fled from Dennehy with his daughters after she came home in a drunken rage one night in 2009 . Mr Lee, who died from stab wounds to the chest, was found in a ditch in Newborough, Cambridgeshire, on Easter Saturday, March 29. Her other two victims, who were also stabbed to death, were found dumped a short distance away four days later. She will undoubtedly be handed one of the biggest prison sentences ever for a woman at the conclusion of the court case. It is a far cry from the lively 15-year-old that Mr Treanor met in 1997 when she bounded up to him in a park as he walked his German shepherd and exclaimed: ‘I really love dogs.’ The pair immediately hit it off and, despite Mr Treanor being six years her senior, they became a couple. They lived a nomadic lifestyle, finding work where they could and moving from house to house until Dennehy became pregnant at 16. Periods of stability were interspersed with breaks in the relationship when Dennehy’s drinking, promiscuity and reckless behaviour drove them apart. A final three-year period of calm saw the birth of their second daughter in 2006 but her descent into drugs, drink and casual sex led to a permanent break in 2009. Mr Treanor, who this year married girlfriend Vicky in a ceremony in Australia, said: ‘I still can’t believe it. Her life was pretty crazy but I never expected this - it shows how far she had fallen. ‘It was inevitable that something was going to happen.’","Joanna Dennehy, 31, this week pleaded guilty to killing three men .

"Channel 4 has admitted it made a mistake in editing the word ‘gay’ out of an episode of The Simpsons. The broadcaster’s compliance department removed a seconds-long section of the cartoon broadcast on Sunday afternoon. But yesterday a spokesman for Channel 4 backtracked, admitting censors had acted ‘in error’ because ‘neither the word nor the context was unsuitable’. 'Overly cautious': Channel 4's compliance department cut the word 'gay' from an episode of cartoon The Simpsons aired on Sunday afternoon . The line was cut from a 1994 episode of The Simpsons, called Homer Loves Flanders, screened at 12.55pm on Sunday. In the episode Homer goes to an American football match with neighbour Ned Flanders but at first is embarrassed to be seen with the religious man. The pair bond after Ned introduces Homer to the star quarterback. As they drive away, they pass Homer’s workmates Lenny and Carl. Homer proudly yells out of the window: ‘I want everyone to know that this is Ned Flanders ... my friend!’ In the original episode, Lenny turns to Carl and says: ‘What’d he say?’ Carl replies: ‘I dunno. Somethin’ about being gay.’ However in the version screened on Sunday, Carl’s line was edited out. The episode abruptly cut to adverts after Lenny said: ‘What’d he say?’ 'What'd he say?' Carl's reply to Lenny was cut from the episode by Channel 4's compliance department . Channel 4 said that Simpsons episodes broadcast before 6pm are checked by its compliance department for unsuitable content, and that in this instance the department had been overly-cautious. A spokesman said: ‘We always carefully consider the context in which language is used in our programming. ‘However in this instance the episode was edited in error as neither the word nor the context was unsuitable.’ Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, says there is no evidence to conclude that use of the word ‘gay’ is ‘necessarily and automatically intended to be, or is, offensive.’ Broadcasters are told to restrict usage of ‘gay’ in a negative context when children are likely to be watching, as it could contribute to bullying. In May 2006, Chris Moyles was accused of being homophobic after he dismissed a ringtone, saying ‘I don’t want that one, it’s gay,’ on his Radio 1 Breakfast Show. After receiving complaints, the BBC defended the presenter, arguing that the word ‘gay’, in addition to being used to mean ‘homosexual’ or ‘carefree’, is also used as a synonym for ‘lame’ or ‘rubbish’. The same year Oxford University student Sam Brown was arrested for making homophobic remarks and spent the night in a cell after he called a police horse ‘gay’. The CPS decided that there was not enough evidence to prosecute Mr Brown and it dropped the case.","The broadcaster cut the word from the episode Homer Loves Flanders screened on Sunday afternoon at 12.55pm .

"Vodafone has unveiled the next ‘revolution’ in smartphones that will see shoppers use their handsets instead of cash or cards at the checkout. The mobile phone giant's partnership with Visa will allow users to pay for goods or services from the autumn with a wave or tap of their smartphone - in the same way Oyster cards are used on London's public transport. The service, which acts as a mobile wallet, will be available on Near Field Communications-enabled smartphones using a form of mobile payment technology called Visa payWave mobile. Smartphones will be used as wallets in Vodafone's scheme . Set to launch worldwide from the spring, it will be based on the Visa prepaid account and available to users of the Vodafone stored value account. While consumers can simply swipe their phone at a payment terminal to pay for less expensive items such as newspapers or coffees, they will be asked to enter a pin code for purchases of £15 or more. Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao said this new method of payment represents ‘the next stage of the smartphone revolution’ which offered customers ‘speed, simplicity and convenience’. 'Revolution': Vodafone's mobile payment scheme will launch worldwide in the spring . A special chip called a 'tag' is planted in phones. Using near field communications (NFC) technology, details of the . purchase are transmitted wirelessly to a central data bank and logged on your . credit card file. For purchases over £15, users must punch in a PIN number. The system began trials last summer in New York and San Francisco and is already used for bus trips in China and for buying cinema and theatre tickets in India. He said: ‘Our mobile wallet will be open to any service provider and we are committed to enable all partners to provide our joint customers the richest service portfolio possible.’ Visa said the service has ‘the potential to transform the way people pay and get paid the world over’. Peter Ayliffe, chief executive of Visa Europe, said Visa's partnership with Vodafone represented a ‘huge stride forward for mobile payments’. He said: ‘Visa's future of payments initiative is more than just a promise: these services are real, tangible and coming to the mainstream consumer market in the very near future.’ Industry analysts said the momentum for mobile payments is ‘slowly but surely growing’. Paul Lambert, senior analyst at Informa Telecoms & Media, said: ‘As operators and customers' allegiance to them are coming under relentless attack from internet companies, making sure consumers identify with the Vodafone brand may go some way to improving customer loyalty - if the service works well from a end-to-end perspective. ‘Visa, meanwhile, will benefit from what it expects will be rapid adoption of the service, using as it will its underlying infrastructure and network of merchants.’ Other companies are also getting a foothold in the market, with Barclays having recently launched its Pingit service. This is an app that allows customers to send and receive payments using Apple or Android phones.",The system works just like London's Oyster cards .

"Many children enjoy a glass of milk with a cookie before bed but a doctor has found this popular snack may be responsible for a string of health problems. Dubbed the 'milk and cookie disease', the combination of sugar and dairy late at night is believed to be the cause of many childhood ailments, including running noses, coughs, sore throats, constipation and fatigue. Dr Julie Wei, a pediatric otolaryngologist at Nemours Children’s Hospital in Orlando, Florida, made the connection after treating numerous children with the chronic symptoms. Not such a treat: Childhood ailments such as coughs, sore throats and fatigue may be caused by the consumption of dairy and sugar before bed. The condition has been labelled 'milk and cookie disease' She initially tried treating her young patients with medications, but it generally had little effect. After looking further into the individual cases, she found that many of the children frequently ate sugary snacks such as cookies and lots of dairy products including milk before bed. Dr Wei believed the combination was likely to be causing the food to back up into the stomach, esophagus and throat causing cold-like symptoms. She asked her patients to stop eating dairy and sugary products before bedtime and found that their symptoms quickly improved significantly. Dr Wei has called the condition 'milk and cookie disease' and suggests that up to 75 per cent of American children who are otherwise healthy may be suffering from it. Research: Dr Julie Wei, a pediatric otolaryngologist at Nemours Children¿s Hospital in Orlando, Florida, made the connection between bedtime snacks and childhood ailments after talking to her patients . She puts this down to the average American snacking more as they have less time to sit down for proper meals. She said: 'We’re busy people; no one’s really thinking about what their kids are eating.' The mother of one patient, five-year-old Jonathan Giambrone, said she has seen a significant improvement in her son's health since she stopped him from snacking late at night and only gave him water before bed on Dr Wei's recommendations. Becky Giambrone told Fox News: 'It was really hard for him to take in a breath; he sounded like Darth Vader. In a three week period, we noticed a substantial difference.' Dr Wei recommends that children shouldn't have any snacks or any drinks but water up to two hours before bedtime to avoid food sitting in the stomach.","Combination of dairy and sugar late at night is believed to be the cause of many childhood ailments such as coughs, sore throats and fatigue .

"World Bank President Robert Zoellick will step down in June . World Bank President Robert Zoellick will step down in June it has been revealed and the U.S. government has indicated that his replacement could go to a non-American. The Obama administration said it would open the process to competition, marking the first time it has shown willingness to loosen its grip on the world's top development lender. Zoellick took the reins at the Bank in 2007 after a staff revolt pushed out Paul Wolfowitz, and he moved quickly to return the institution's focus to alleviating poverty. Developing countries have for years pressed for a greater voice in leading global financial institutions and are likely to stress the importance of a competitive process, but the United States is still widely expected to retain its hold on the job. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said in a statement: 'It is very important that we continue to have strong, effective leadership of this important institution, and in the coming weeks, we plan to put forward a candidate with experience and requisite qualities to take this institution forward'. While Geithner called for an 'open and expeditious process,' analysts say Washington can ill afford to give up the post without risking the U.S. Congress cutting funding for the Bank. In an interview, Zoellick said his decision to leave on June 30 at the end of his five-year term was his own and was not due to pressure from the Obama administration. The former U.S. chief trade negotiator and deputy secretary of state dismissed speculation he would join a Republican presidential campaign as 'not true,' saying only that he would decide what to do next once he leaves the World Bank. 'It really was my own decision,' Zoellick said. 'My personal sense is it's time to move on and I think once you feel that way you shouldn't stay.' Zoellick, who discussed the selection process with the board in a two-hour meeting yesterday, said the first step was for the board to call for nominations. 'An open process is important,' he said. In the running? Possible U.S. candidates include Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, left, and former White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers, right . Speculation has been rife over who might take the job when Zoellick departs. Possible U.S. candidates include Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers, but the State Department said Clinton would not be taking the job. 'She has said this is not happening,' spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. Emerging market and developing countries have campaigned hard in recent years to break Europe's grip on the top position at the International Monetary Fund and the United States' hold on the presidency of the World Bank. Officials from large emerging economies like Brazil said the selection process for Zoellick's successor should be based on qualifications and not nationality. However, they acknowledged that given U.S. congressional pressure the job will probably remain in the hands of an American. Last year, emerging market economies made an aggressive push to fill the IMF top job in a bitter contest won by France's Christine Lagarde. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers said the World Bank job should stay in U.S. hands. Zoellick took the reins at the Bank (HQ in Washington pictured) in 2007 after a staff revolt pushed out Paul Wolfowitz . 'I think it ought to be (an American) given the balance between that and the IMF and the interests that we have right now,' said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, a Democrat from Massachusetts. Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, the committee's top Republican, echoed that sentiment: 'Ideally I would like to see an American replace him ... That would be my preference.' Nancy Birdsall, who heads the Center for Global Development in Washington, said that while the United States was committed to an open process on paper, domestic politics necessitated a American successor. 'The election year timing puts the White House in an especially unenviable position. There is a risk that the World Bank could become a highly partisan, U.S. hot-button issue, as the UN has too often been,' she wrote in a recent blog. When Zoellick took the job in July 2007, he turned the attention of the Bank to a brewing food and energy price crisis that was stoking social unrest in the poorest parts of the world. As the bank looked for ways to help, the global financial crisis of 2008 threatened to undermine more than a decade of strong growth in emerging and developing countries. Under Zoellick, World Bank lending increased sharply to $44 billion in fiscal 2010 from $13.5 billion in 2008, reflecting the increased development needs of fast-rising countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. Zoellick also won approval for an $86.2 billion increase in the Bank's general resources. It was the first increase in more than 20 years. He championed more voting power for emerging economies and convinced China, Brazil and others to contribute more funding. Despite budget strains in the developed world, Zoellick lobbied for and secured more than $90 billion in pledges to replenish a separate World Bank fund for the poorest countries. In an effort to modernize the World Bank, he has given a greater voice to emerging economies. He has also championed the need for better governance in regions such as the Middle East, where street protests toppled dictators in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya.","Robert Zoellick will step down in June after five years .

"A drunken Welsh wedding guest who insulted the English was convicted of racism today. Phillip Pritchard, 32, was on a coach home from a smart country wedding in Wales when he started singing anti-English songs. A court heard Pritchard, a father of two, was 'winding up' some of the wedding guests who travelled from England for the ceremony at the upmarket Peterstone Court Hotel in Brecon.

"A giant salt water crocodile that lived 160 million years ago was as long as of a double-decker bus, scientists claim. The terrifying creature roamed the ocean feasting on marine animals such as turtles and may even have eaten dinosaurs, according to a new study. The fearsome prehistoric reptile measured more than 30 feet long (9 metres). A giant salt water crocodile that lived 160 million years ago was almost as long as a double-decker bus, scientists claim. M. hugii (illustrated) was the largest at 30.4ft (9.3 metres) Fresh research into Machimosaurus reveals key details of how and where it lived. Experts say three different species could be found in Europe and a fourth in Ethiopia. M. hugii was the largest at 30.4ft (9.3 metres) which is larger than the biggest Nile or saltwater crocodiles of the modern era. The biggest living captive crocodile living today measures 18ft (5.5 m). The smallest of the prehistoric crocodiles was M. buffetauti at around 19 feet (6 metres), while M. mosae was between 20 and 26 feet (6 to 8 metres). The African creature, M. nowackianus, is only known from a single tooth, so its body length cannot be reliably estimated. Four species of Machimosaurus roamed the ocean feasting on marine animals such as turtles and even dinosaurs. Three of the species believed to live in the area which is now modern Europe, are illustrated, along with a human to show scale .

Four species of Machimosaurus lived 160 million years ago. Three could be found in the waters around Europe and one in Africa. The creatures ate marine animals such as turtles and even perhaps dinosaurs. Although Machimosaurus had blunt, conical teeth and long, slender snouts, they were so large that they could almost anything they wanted. M. hugii was the largest at 30.4ft (9.3 metres). The smallest of the prehistoric crocodiles was M. buffetauti at around 19 feet (6 metres), while M. mosae was between 20 and 26 feet (6 to 8 metres). The African creature, M. nowackianus, is only known from a single tooth, so its body length cannot be reliably estimated. Each of the species evolved to hunt in different habitats, from open seas to rivers. ‘M. hugii was the largest of all these species, with a body length exceeding nine metres, Dr Mark Young, of the University of Edinburgh, said. Although Machimosaurus had blunt, concical teeth and long, slender snouts, they were so large that they could almost anything they wanted. Bite marks inflicted by one of the beasts have even been found in the fossilised bones of a giant long-necked dinosaur. Scientists believe Machimosaurus swam long distances in the open sea, but probably hunted near coasts, snatching any unfortunate animal that got too close. Each of the species adapted features that enabled them to live and hunt in a range of habitats. They varied in body length, the composition of their skeleton, skull and lower jaw shape. Machimosaurus fed on marine turtles and lived during the Late Jurassic period, either on the coast or in large rivers flowing into the sea. M. hugii would have been well adapted for swimming in open seas while its closest cousins lived stuck close to the coast. Although Machimosaurus had blunt, concical teeth and long, slender snouts, it was so large it could almost anything it wanted. Bite marks inflicted by the beast have even been found in the fossilised bones of a giant long-necked dinosaur. This illustration shows a Cetiosaurus oxoneoensis, which lived at around the same time . The study, published in Royal Society Open Science, analysed fossils held in museums across Europe and found they were much bigger than any living crocodile. The evolution of Machimosaurus mirrors that of today’s crocodiles, whose saltwater varieties are far bigger and suited to larger territories compared with their smaller cousins that live closer to shore or in fresh water. From detailed analysis, the researchers were able to determine key elements of the animals’ anatomy and lifestyle and concluded not all were of the same species. Until now, scientists were unsure whether more than one species of Machimosaurus existed. In May 2012, paleontologists from North Carolina State University shared news of the fossilised remains of a 60-million-year-old South American giant turtle (illustrated) that lived in what is now Colombia . In May 2012, paleontologists from North Carolina State University shared news of the fossilised remains of a 60-million-year-old South American giant that lived in what is now Colombia. Carbonemys cofrinii, which means 'coal turtle', was part of a group of turtles known as pelomedusoides. The specimen's skull measures xx inches (24cm) and the shell, which was recovered nearby and is believed to belong to the same animal - measures five feet seven inches long (172cm). The fossil was named Carbonemys because it was discovered in 2005 in a coal mine that was part of northern Colombia's Cerrejon formation. Dr Dan Ksepka, a palaeontologist and research associate at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, believes a turtle of this size would have needed a large territory in order to obtain enough food to survive. 'It's like having one big snapping turtle living in the middle of a lake,' he said. 'That turtle survives because it has eaten all of the major competitors for resources. We found many bite-marked shells at this site that show crocodilians preyed on side-necked turtles. 'None would have bothered an adult Carbonemys, though - in fact smaller crocs would have been easy prey for this behemoth.' Smaller relatives of Carbonemys existed alongside dinosaurs. But the giant version appeared five million years after the dinosaurs vanished, during a period when giant varieties of many different reptiles – including Titanoboa cerrejonensis, the largest snake ever discovered – lived in this part of South America.","Fearsome prehistoric predator measured more than 30 feet long (9 metres)

Then when she gave birth to her second daughter, she nearly died after her heart stopped beating but was resuscitated by a midwife. Amanda said she received ""amazing"" treatment and support from the NHS so she was shocked to hear of the suffering of other parents. Samantha Allington revealed how she was mistreated when she was rushed hospital in pain when seven weeks pregnant. She explained: 'I had to do urine sample and the baby passed when I went to the toilet. A nurse came and grabbed the pot and ran off with it.

However, she returned find his grave had been dismantled and there was another baby in the same plot . Incineration of fetal remains is banned in Scotland but there are only guidelines for rest of UK stating remains should be handled 'sensitively'. Dispatches discovered that 27 trusts incinerate remains, sometimes with the parents oblivious to the fact their babies are being disposed of along with other medical waste such as syringes and swabs. One hospital, Addenbrooke, in Cambridge is even heated by burning clinical waste including miscarried babies. Angela Whitton, from the Royal College of Nursing: 'That's appalling, it should not take place in this day and age. Hopefully we will ban incineration of fetal remains in the near future.' As reported earlier in the Daily Mail, last night health minister Dan Poulter stepped in to order an immediate ban on incinerating fetal remains head of the documentary airing this evening. Amanda praised her own experience of the NHS but was shocked to hear others had been less fortunate . 'This practice is totally unacceptable,' he said. 'That is why I have asked Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS medical director, to write to all NHS hospital trusts, to make it clear that it must stop now. 'The Chief Medical Officer has also written to the Human Tissue Authority to ask them to make sure that there is clear guidance on this issue. 'While the vast majority of hospitals are acting in the appropriate way, that must be the case for all hospitals and the Human Tissue Authority has now been asked to ensure that it acts on this issue without delay.' Dispatches also reveals that other parents have suffered due to the way burials of their deceased babies have been handled. Katy Quillan buried her stillborn son David at Duke Street cemetery Southport. She said she discussed plans with her local hospital trust and funeral directors and then created a memorial where her son was buried with a small fence, stones and flowers. She later returned to find it been dismantled and was horrified to find a new baby's grave in its place. Both she and the parents of that baby were devastated to think their baby did not have a grave of their own or any lasting memorial. When they complained, they were told the procedure had been explained previously but they probably weren't in the the ""right frame of mind"" to take it in. But Katy said: 'I would have remembered if they've told me six other babies would be buried with mine.' The NHS trust involved blamed the funeral directors and council who operate the cemetery for not fully explaining the situation to the bereaved parents. Hunters Funeral Directors, who handed the burial, said all babies are buried individually in their own plots but permanent plots are not permitted in baby section. They added: 'We are truly sorry if this was not explained clearly enough, and we are working to improve information.' Sefton Council who operate the cemetery added: 'Items were removed from her baby's grave to facilitate the burial of another baby in the adjacent space.

Stunt: Del. Joe Morrissey holds up an AK-47 during a speech on the floor of the House of Delegates about the need for greater gun controls . 'Even though the law right now says you can't bring this gun into a high school or elementary or middle school, there is nothing from keeping you from walking in front of [an elementary school with a gun],' he added. Morrissey assured that the gun was not loaded, but a Republican lawmaker wasn't convinced. Del. Todd Gilbert asked Morrissey to take his finger off the trigger lock. Despite his stunt, a measure authored by Morrissey calling for tighter gun controls was rejected by a House subcommittee Thursday before making it to the floor for a vote. The bill called for a ban on assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines. The AK-47, which was designed in 1945, is one of the first assault rifles ever made and it is also the most popular. Morrissey's office told the Examiner that the AK-47 did not belong to the Morrissey and that it was borrowed from someone else. Despite his stunt, a measure authored by Morrissey calling for tighter gun controls was rejected by a House subcommittee on Thursday before making it to the floor for a vote . In the aftermath of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. that left 20 children dead, a number of lawmakers and activists have been going to great lengths to push for new gun laws in the U.S. NBC's David Gregory famously brandished a high capacity magazine on 'Meet the Press' last month during an interview with National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre. The stunt broke a law in Washington, D.C. - where the 'Meet the Press' studio is located - that bans the ammunition cartridges. Morrissey didn't break any laws, however, because Virginia state law allows weapons, including assault rifles, inside the Capitol.","Democrat Joe Morrissey held the AK-47 on the floor of the House of Delegates as he called for a ban on assault weapons .

"Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, pictured, has warned of the risks to cross-border healthcare in the event of a Yes vote in the referendum . A vote for independence would create a 'Hadrian's Wall of health' between England and Scotland, the medical director of NHS England warns today. Writing exclusively in today's Mail, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh warns of the risks to cross-border healthcare - with 44,000 Scottish patients treated in England last year alone. In a separate warning, Scotland's struggling NHS is facing devastating cutbacks of £450million under the SNP, an explosive secret dossier has revealed. The confidential paper seen by the Scottish Daily Mail, kept under wraps in the run-up to the referendum, shows that health board chiefs are preparing to make huge savings in 2015 and 2016. Sir Bruce today destroys Alex Salmond's claims that a No vote could lead to the destruction of Scotland's devolved public health service, pointing out that 'the people of Wales, England or Northern Ireland could not privatise the Scottish NHS even if they wanted to'. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens also waded into the referendum debate last night, arguing that a Yes vote means a 'bilateral agreement' may have to be drawn up to allow Scots patients access to specialist health services in England. That mean hundreds of patients currently on the waiting list could face an even longer delay for life-saving heart, lung and liver transplants. Even though it has been fully devolved to Holyrood since 1999, the future of the NHS has been put at the forefront of the battle for independence by the SNP. Mr Salmond and his ministers have claimed that voting for separation is the only way to protect Scotland's NHS budget – which can be indirectly affected by health spending in England - and the spread of 'privatisation' from south of the Border. However, any private contractors in England are still paid from the public purse, and the budget for England's NHS is scheduled to increase from £105.6billion in 2013-14 to £110.4billion in 2015-16. The world-renowned Institute Fiscal Studies last week revealed how the Scottish Government has actually been cutting health services in recent years while there have been funding increases in England. Now, a document released to the Mail shows how Scotland's NHS chiefs discussed 'significant challenges' and further cutbacks at a meeting on August 6. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown used a speech today to accuse the SNP of 'perpetrating a lie' about protecting the NHS with independence . The SNP are 'perpetrating a lie' about protecting the NHS with independence because Holyrood already has the power to keep the health service in public hands, former prime minister Gordon Brown has said. Mr Brown said the nationalists should make way for a Labour government in Scotland if they continue to insist they are 'powerless' to protect the NHS without a Yes vote in the independence referendum. The SNP has argued that the health service north of the border is at risk due to health policies at Westminster, despite the area being devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Speaking at a campaign event in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, Mr Brown said: 'The NHS lie of the Scottish National Party has been exposed. The Scottish Parliament can keep the NHS in public hands with its existing powers. 'If the SNP continue to say they are powerless to protect the NHS in Scotland, let them make way for a Labour government in Scotland and we will protect the NHS.' Mr Brown said the Labour Party would never allow the health service to be privatised in Scotland. 'It is the SNP who are perpetrating a lie about what the NHS can and cannot do in Scotland,' he said. 'Over these next few hours, you must remind the people in Scotland the NHS has the powers and the Scottish Parliament has the powers to fund the health service, to protect the health service, to stop any privatisation, and to keep the health service in public hands.' It estimates a reduction in day-to-day spending of £210million in 2015-16, rising to £224million in 2016-17, warning that annual savings will need to increase from 2 per cent to 3.5 per cent. 'Significant revenue pressures will be realised in 2015-16 and 2016-17, primarily due to the combined effect of a reducing increase in baseline funding, the project impact of the pension revaluation [contribution increases] and loss of national insurance rebate and the cost of funding of the drugs budget – largely due to changes to access to rare and ultra rare drugs, availability of new treatments or extending use to new indications,' it states. 'The total savings required will be £400million-to-£450million in addition to savings required in 2014-15.' It adds: 'Limited time is available to plan for 2015-16 and 2016-17 and immediate action is required to collectively assess the options that will ensure that NHS Scotland can operate within its overall allocation and that we can continue to provide quality, safe and effective care to our constituent populations.' Last night, Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: 'These papers show that the SNP have a secret agenda to cut health spending after the referendum. 'Alex Salmond was elected on a manifesto to protect health spending and now he is planning cuts but has decided not to tell anyone until after Thursday's vote.' Writing in today's Mail, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh argues against 'trivialising' the challenge facing health services with 'emotional political soundbites'. And in a new report, Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, states: 'The Scottish Parliament has run its own NHS for the past 15 years, with freedom to set its own health spending. That will continue regardless of the result of their independence referendum. 'However, Scottish patients currently make use of a number of specialist health services throughout England, such as heart/lung/and other organ transplants as well as numerous specialist cancer treatments. Alex Salmond, pictured, and his ministers have claimed that voting for separation is the only way to protect Scotland's NHS budget . A vote for independence would create a 'Hadrian's Wall of health' between England and Scotland, the medical director of NHS England warns today . 'Were Scotland to decide to cede from the United Kingdom, the legal status of Scottish patients wishing to access these services south of the border would change. 'This would require a new bilateral agreement, or if Scotland were accepted into the EU/European Economic Area then Scottish patients could in theory be treated here on the same basis as, say, a patient from Belgium or Slovakia.' Responding to the leaked document, a Scottish Government spokesman said: 'We have and will go on protecting and increasing the NHS budget, and our latest £12.1billion resource budget reflects a funding increase in real terms for both 2014-15 and 2015-16. 'More than £1.5billion has been ploughed back into frontline services through efficiency savings in NHS Scotland over the last six years thanks to the three per cent target set by this Government. 'This paper is part of the regular discussions among NHS leaders to plan for NHS Scotland's future. Health boards have submitted their plans for how they continue to deliver quality care and treatment within their allocated funding. 'Like all healthcare systems around the world, Scotland's NHS needs to continue evolving.' No campaign's fury over secret NHS cuts as Charles Kennedy makes bid to be Union's unlikely saviour . Charles Kennedy and Danny Alexander today hit out at Alex Salmond for suggesting that Scottish independence could save the NHS. The two Liberal Democrat heavyweights pointed to a secret report warning that Scottish health services face £400million of cuts as proof that the NHS is not safe in the SNP's hands. Their intervention came as Mr Kennedy, the former party leader, was being promoted as an unlikely last-minute saviour of the Union. The Lib Dems unveiled a new campaign poster with a huge picture of Mr Kennedy on the side, leading him to say 'they're keeping the best till last'. Billboard: The Liberal Democrats today sought to put forward Charles Kennedy as a 'big beast' of the Union campaign; Mr Kennedy is pictured alongside Danny Alexander, Jo Swinson and Willie Rennie . Mr Salmond has repeatedly insisted that the NHS in Scotland will be subjected to increasing privatisation if the UK stays together. But at a campaign event in Glasgow today, Mr Kennedy reminded voters that the NHS, BBC and pound had been created using the resources of the whole of Britain. 'These achievements were built without borders, and to put down artificial borders in the 21st century is absurd,' he said. 'The SNP ran up the flag of fear, saying that if you vote No you would be complicit in bringing about the break-up of the NHS. 'But ministers have been sitting on a report warning of a £400million shortfall in the NHS in Scotland.' Fightback: Mr Alexander and Mr Kennedy both claimed that the NHS would face huge cuts under the SNP . Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, added: 'The big news on the NHS is the £400million of cuts. 'We know that a Yes vote would mean deep cuts to public services, year after year after year.' The use of Mr Kennedy on the new poster suggests that the ex-leader, who was forced to resign in 2006 after struggling with a drinking problem, is being set up as a 'big beast' who can tackle the charismatic Alex Salmond in the run-up to Thursday's vote. 'Maybe they're keeping the best till last, you never know,' he said today - after pointedly describing himself as a member of the 'Scottish Liberal Democrats'. Mr Alexander added: 'Charles is one of the most respected political figures here in Scotland. 'It's very important that people hear from Charles Kennedy and the Liberal Democrats.' Junior minister Jo Swinson, the MP for East Dunbartonshire, said: 'Charles is a fantastic asset. He's well-loved - he absolutely the right person to be the Liberal Democrat representative.'","Yes vote would create barrier between between England and Scotland .

"Opinionated: Planing Minister Nick Boles warned that immigration is fueling rising house prices . Immigration is helping to fuel rises in house prices that are preventing young people from owning their own home, the Planning Minister has warned. Nick Boles said he has changed his mind about immigration after seeing how the arrival of 2 million new immigrants over the last decade has left Britain short of houses. He warned that failure to build enough homes would mean only the professional classes would be able to buy a house. Mr Boles told the Mail: ‘I have become much more critical of immigration. A very substantial contribution to housing need comes from the level of immigration in the past two decades.’ The Planning Minister revealed that he has changed his views since becoming MP for the Lincolnshire towns of Grantham and Stamford in 2010 and minister with responsibility for liberalising the planning system to promote house building last year. He said: ‘I had the classic metropolitan view about immigration that it was broadly good for me because it made life more varied and interesting and there were lots of people bringing different skills into the economy. ‘I wasn’t really aware of the effect on people who were competing for relatively low skilled jobs and competing for public services. ‘I was someone who had spent much of the last 10 years in London. It was only when I found myself in rural Lincolnshire that I saw the other side of it for people working hard and trying to get on. ‘Immigration has made my ministerial job more challenging. It has meant that we need to build more houses than we would otherwise have done. ‘And it has made it more difficult to persuade people that we need to build more houses. Peoples’ response is that we are building homes for new arrivals rather than for their children.’ Mr Boles said young people are being priced out of the property market, citing figures which show that the number of first time buyers who get a mortgage without help from their parents has halved from 69 per cent in 2005 to just 35 per cent now. ‘The biggest block on home ownership now is affordability,’ he said. Warning: Mr Boles warned that failure to build enough homes would mean only the professional classes would be able to afford to buy a house . Out of the market: Rising house prices will see only the professional classes able to buy property . ‘Are we really prepared to sit back and accept that the only people who are able to buy homes will be people whose parents can help them?’ Mr Boles has been criticised by Tory supporters for putting the need for new housing ahead of the preservation of greenfield land. Under fire: Mr Boles, pictured, has been criticised by Tory MPs for putting building homes ahead of preserving the Green Belt . But he said Conservatives should back his reforms because they will help preserve the dream of a property owning democracy promoted by Margaret Thatcher, who grew up in his Grantham seat. He said: ‘She made some very, very strong statements about home ownership. “A home, like food,” she told her constituents, “is a basic need in our lives”,’ he said. ‘Home ownership, she argued, “gives people independence and a stake in their country”. She was very critical of council tower blocks just as I’m very critical of the ugliness and impersonality of many modern housing projects. ‘What she thought then was that backing home ownership and generating that sort of pride in your own place and that investment in community, and that natural human instinct to improve where you live because you own it, she absolutely believed in that and I believe in it now. ‘Aspiration in terms of housing is going backwards. We are reverting, slowly but surely to the 19th century, where the only people who could own their own homes were the professional classes on large incomes and the landed gentry. ‘If we’re not careful, we will have done the most extraordinary feat of regressing in terms of the availability of what Margaret Thatcher said was as fundamental a human need as the desire for food.’ Excuse: Foreign criminals have frequently used European human rights law to prevent them being deported .","Nick Boles warned that young people are being prevented from buying homes .

"Separated: Woody Allen with Dylan Farrow. Despite the case being thrown out he was not allowed to see her again . Woody Allen cannot be prosecuted on child molestation charges as the statute of limitations on accusations by Dylan Farrow has passed. The Connecticut prosecutor who investigated Allen more than 20 years ago in the case but did not file charges says it's now too late. The news comes as critics accuse Dylan Farrow of cynically timing her accusations to thwart her former adoptive father's chances of winning an Oscar for his critically acclaimed film Blue Jasmine. Former Litchfield County state attorney Frank Maco said in a phone interview Sunday with The Associated Press that the statute of limitations on adopted daughter Dylan Farrow's accusations ran out at least 15 years ago. Maco had said in 1993 that he lacked evidence to prosecute Allen but suspected the abuse did occur. He retired in 2003. Farrow renewed allegations against Allen in an open letter to The New York Times on Saturday, saying he sexually assaulted her when she was seven years old after he and actress Mia Farrow adopted her. Allen has denied the accusations. Farrow's first-person account, which appeared on reporter Nicholas Kritoff's blog, marks the first time that Farrow, the daughter of actress Mia Farrow, has directly addressed the alleged sex abuse. Cate Blanchett's performance in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine has been lavishly praised, but could Dylan Farrow's letter derail her chances? Leading lady: Cate Blanchett and Woody Allen on the set of Blue Jasmine . It may seem that a 21-year-old alleged crime should have no bearing on Blanchett's 2014 Oscars, but being called out over the issue may make voters think twice before casting their ballots. Farrow concluded her open letter by singling out stars who have starred in Allen's films, including Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett. 'What if it had been your child, Cate Blanchett?' she asked. Blanchett has been tight-lipped on the issue but addressed it last night, saying to journalist Jeffrey Wells, 'It's obviously been a long and painful situation for the family and I hope they find some sort of resolution and peace.' If Blue Jasmine picks up any of the three awards for which it is nominated, is the Academy complicit in the alleged abuse by feting Allen and ignoring his crimes? Allen's guilt is currently being tried in the court of public opinion, and it's unclear whether the Academy will take a stand. So far, Blanchett has won the best actress award at the Critics Choice, Golden Globe, SAG, New York Film Critics Circle, Los Angeles Film Critics Association and National Society of Film Critics awards. In gut-wrenching detail, Dylan Farrow wrote in her statement how at age seven, her adoptive father, Allen, allegedly led her by the hand to a dim attic on the second floor of their house. 'He told me to lay on my stomach and . play with my brother’s electric train set,' Miss Farrow recounted. 'Then . he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering . that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we’d go . to Paris and I’d be a star in his movies.' She noted that to this day, she finds it hard to look at toy trains. Farrow . went on to describe how the award-winning director of 'Annie Hall' and . 'Manhattan' would always find a way to touch her and do things to her . she did not like, including sticking his thumb in her mouth, forcing her . to get into bed with him and placing his head in her naked lap. 'I thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters. But what he did to me in the attic felt different,' she said. Unable to keep her alleged encounters . with her father secret anymore, young Dylan went to her mother, asking . her if her own father used to do the same things to her that Allen was . doing. The girl's . explosive allegations put an end to Farrow and Allen's relationship in . 1992, setting off a legal battle in which Dylan claimed the filmmaker . accused his former girlfriend of brainwashing her daughter into thinking . that he had assaulted her. Break up: Dylan Farrow with her parents Mia Farrow and Allen in 1987. The filmmaker claims his ex-partner coached their daughter into accusing him of abuse . Unsettling allegations: Farrow, seen left with Allen in Italy in 1991, and with her mother and sister in 1992 (right), wrote how the director would stick his thumb in her mouth, force her to get in bed with him and place his head in her naked lap . Public break-up: Around the time this picture of Allen, Farrow, little Dylan and her brother Ronan was taken in 1992, the actress and filmmaker split following the revelations of sexual abuse . What followed next was a drawn-out process in which Dylan was dragged from one psychologist to the next, recounting her story over and over again to see if she was lying. In the end, Allen was denied visitation rights with his children, but a Connecicut prosecutor declined to charge him, saying that while there was enough evidence for the case to potentially stand up in court, he was dropping criminal proceedings due to Dylan's fragile state. Allen, 78, has always denied the . allegations of sexual abuse. He was . never charged with, or convicted of, a crime in this case. Hit back: Woody Allen has again been forced to deny claims he abused Dylan Farrow . Keeping a low profile: Allen was accompanied by a retinue of people, but he sought to avoid drawing attention to himself . Hoops fan: Filmmaker Woody Allen, left, leaves late in the fourth quarter of an NBA basketball game between the Miami Heat and the New York Knicks Saturday . Shorlty after Allen and Farrow's split, it was revealed that the filmmaker began . an affair with his adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, whom he married in . 1997. On Saturday . night, just hours after the release of his daughter's bombshell letter, a . somber-looking Allen was spotted arriving at a New York Knicks game in . New York with two of his other adopted daughters in tow. In her open letter, . Dylan Farrow claimed that Allen used his ‘sexual relationship’ with her . stepsister, Soon-Yi, to cover up the abuse Dylan herself had allegedly . suffered at his hands. ‘That . he got away with what he did to me haunted me as I grew up,’ Miss . Farrow wrote. ‘I was stricken with guilt that I had allowed him to be . near other little girls.’ Dylan . candidly talked about the effect the alleged ordeal had on her . later life, including a battle with eating disorders and her terror at . being touched by men. The woman also said she began cutting herself. His other girls: Woody Allen exits Madison Square Garden with adopted daughters Bechet Allen and Manzie Allen after watching the New York Knicks lose to the Miami Heat . Scandalous relationship: Dylan Farrow accused her father of using his affair with his adopted daughter Soon-Yi, right, to cover up his abuse of her; the two married in 1997 . Farrow also used her soul-baring . confession to attack the Hollywood establishment for 'turning a blind . eye' and helping along Allen’s career in the entertainment industry. ‘Most . found it easier to accept the ambiguity, to say, “who can say what . happened,” to pretend that nothing was wrong,’ she said. ‘Actors praised . him at awards shows. Networks put him on TV. Critics put him in . magazines. Final straw: Dylan explained that what prompted her to write the open letter was seeing her adopted father receiving yet another Oscar nomination for his latest film, Blue Jasmine . ‘Each time I saw my abuser’s face – . on a poster, on a t-shirt, on television – I could only hide my panic . until I found a place to be alone and fall apart.’ Dylan . Farrow's decision to offer a first-person account of her torment has . been spurred by Allen's latest nomination for an Academy Award and last . month’s Golden Globes ceremony, where he received the prestigious Cecil B . DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award. ‘It felt like a personal rebuke, like the awards and accolades were a way to tell me to shut up and go away,’ Dylan wrote. Farrow, . who described herself as a happily married woman, did not shy away from . condemning the actors who have starred in her father’s films over the . years, some of whom were on hand January 12 to present Allen with his . Golden Globe. ‘What if it had been you, Emma Stone? Or you, Scarlett Johansson? You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?’ she asked. Farrow's family, including her mother and stepbrother Ronan Farrow, have been unwavering in their support of her. On the night of the Golden Globes ceremony, Ronan Farrow, Allen's would-be son, brought up his sister's alleged assault in a scathing tweet. Support system: Both Dylan's mother, actress and activist Mia Farrow (left), and her adopted brother Ronan Farrow (right), have stood by her claims regarding Woody Allen . Strong words: Woody's son and ex-girlfriend weren't happy about him receiving an honour at the Golden Globes . ‘Missed the Woody Allen tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?’ the newly hired MSNBC host wrote. Dylan Farrow concluded her letter with an appeal to the movie-going public to think twice before they rush to heap praise on her talented adoptive father. ‘So imagine your seven-year-old daughter being led into an attic by Woody Allen. Imagine she spends a lifetime stricken with nausea at the mention of his name. Imagine a world that celebrates her tormenter. ‘Are you imagining that? Now, what’s your favorite Woody Allen movie?’ Shaming stars: Dylan lambasted actors like Diane Keaton and Alec Baldwin who had starred in her father's film; Keaton was on hand last month to present Allen with a lifetime achievement award .","Dylan Farrow wrote that Allen sexually assaulted her for first time as she lay staring at a toy train set .

"Laughing as they stroll together, this is £148million lottery winner Adrian Bayford with the new woman in his life – a Polish-born former sausage factory worker. Marta Jarosz is said to be working as the newly-single 43-year-old’s bodyguard and driver, after he moved out of the £6million Cambridgeshire estate he bought with wife Gillian, 41. And it seems the pair have hit it off – so much so that rumours of a romance between them reached a newspaper in her native Poland. Working relationship: Adrian Bayford at Stansted Airport with 'bodyguard and driver' Marta Jarosz . When asked about 30-year-old Miss Jarosz the multimillionaire insisted she was not his lover, saying: ‘I am not with Marta. She works for me and that’s it.’ His denial came as Miss Jarosz’s mother rejected claims her daughter is a gold-digger, adding that money ‘wouldn’t change Marta’. But the pair looked at ease in each other’s company as they arrived at Stansted Airport on Friday. Joking in the sunshine, with only one small suitcase between them, they could have been mistaken for a couple embarking on a weekend away. Miss Jarosz did not seem to be performing any sort of security role, carrying a £200 leather Fossil designer handbag on her arm and wearing knee-high heeled boots.

He added: ‘I was not on a holiday with Marta.’ Mr and Mrs Bayford revealed in November that their nine-year marriage had ‘broken down irretrievably’ 15 months after they scooped the second biggest lottery prize ever won in Britain. Since then, Miss Jarosz is said to have become a regular visitor to Mr Bayford’s new house and has been seen driving a £34,000 Volvo V40 hatchback thought to be a gift from the father-of-two, who cannot drive. His best friend Richard Hudspith said the pair, who have known each other for a while, had struck up a ‘friendly relationship’. Miss Jarosz has become a regular visitor to Mr Bayford's new house and has been seen driving a £34,000 car . Miss Jarosz, who lives in a terraced house in Haverhill, Suffolk, close to Mr Bayford’s home, used to work at sausage supplier Dalehead Foods in Linton, Cambridgeshire, according to her online CV. She is thought to have met Mr Bayford at a nightclub, when she was working as a bouncer. But she has told her parents she is not in a relationship with him. Speaking at home in rural Poland, Edzia Jarosz denied that her daughter was interested in the 20-stone millionaire for his money and said she was working as his ‘bodyguard and driver’. ‘She wouldn’t be interested in him because he is too rich… She knows that money can’t buy you love and that there are more important things in life,’ said Mrs Jarosz, who first learned of the rumoured romance when it was reported in a Polish newspaper. ‘We are not poor.

"Men should not take high doses of vitamin E or selenium supplements because they have no health benefits and increase the risk of prostate cancer by up to a fifth, scientists have claimed. Vitamin E, naturally found in nuts, spinach and broccoli, is taken to boost the body’s immune system and the mineral selenium, found in fish and meat, is taken to ward off heart disease. But US researchers claim large doses of both can increase the risk of prostate cancer by 17 per cent. Discovery: Men should not take high doses of vitamin E (pictured) or selenium supplements because they have no health benefits and increase the risk of prostate cancer by up to a fifth, U.S. researchers have claimed . This can rise to as much as 91 per cent if a man already has high levels of selenium before taking supplements. The warning centres on high-dose supplements, with researchers saying there appear to be no risks from taking a standard multivitamin. But nor were there any apparent benefits from the supplements. Lead researcher Alan Kristal, of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle, said: ‘Men using these supplements should stop, period. Source: Vitamin E, naturally found in spinach, left, and nuts, right, is taken to boost the body's immune system . Neither selenium nor vitamin E supplementation confers any known benefits, only risks.’ The study looked in detail at a past trial, carried out to test whether extra vitamin E and selenium could help prevent prostate cancer. But instead, researchers discovered more cases of prostate cancer among men taking 400 international units (IU) of vitamin E daily than those taking a placebo. This is the equivalent of 363mg a day, which is 30 times the recommended daily amount. Men with low levels of selenium were the most affected by extra vitamin E – with the supplements raising their prostate cancer risk by 63 per cent. Dr Kristal said: ‘Many people think that dietary supplements are helpful or at the least, innocuous. This is not true. ‘We know from several other studies that some high-dose dietary supplements – that is, supplements that provide far more than the daily recommended intakes of micronutrients – increase cancer risk.’ More than 35,000 healthy men in their 50s and older took part in the initial trial, which began in 2001. Further investigation of this data, published yesterday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, revealed the latest findings. In the UK, the recommended daily amount of vitamin E is 12mg, and most multivitamin pills contain between 15mg and 30mg. However, the UK Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals says the upper ‘safe’ limit is between 700 and 800mg a day – twice as much as taken in the trial. Dr Matthew Hobbs, deputy director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said more studies were needed, but added: ‘If men are concerned about their prostate cancer risk, rather than worrying about selenium  and vitamin E supplements, they should talk to a GP.’","Vitamin E and selenium supplements do not benefit health, say scientists .

"Goodbye to the Lob, farewell to the Pob and anybody sporting a Frob had better start growing out that fringe fast. This autumn it's all about the Wob, or wavy bob. Yes, after the long bob, the Posh (Victoria Beckham) bob and the fringed bob, the wavy bob is the only hairdo in town. Queen of the wob brigade is Jennifer Lawrence, who grew out last year's pixie cut into the casual flicky style. Beyonce, Nicole Richie and Sienna Miller have gone for the chop - and every time I switch on Strictly I see Caroline Flack's wob bouncing across the dancefloor. Scroll down for video . Going for the chop: Lydia with long locks and, right, her new carefree wavy bob . The name may be silly but the look is sizzling: youthful, edgy and seemingly low-maintenance, as messiness is the key to the wob's appeal. What's more, it is supposed to work on almost every face shape. 'The wob is carefree,' says Beverly Hills-based celebrity stylist Nelson Chan. 'The waviness brings out the sexiness in women.' Well, it certainly looks lovely on Lawrence. But would it suit me, 20 years her senior at a ripe old 44, at least a stone heavier and with no hairstylist in my entourage? I wasn't so sure. My hairdo isn't so much low-maintenance as no-maintenance. I don't even own a can of hairspray and the last time I visited the salon with a photograph, saying 'I want to look like her', it was the mid-Nineties and I was clutching a picture of Jennifer Aniston. On me, the 'Rachel' was a disaster. I couldn't be bothered to style it properly, so it ended up more Rod Stewart. I grew out the layers and since then I've kept my hair one length, usually just below the collarbone. So maybe it was time for a style reboot, and perhaps a wob would be the answer. My ten-year-old daughter was solidly behind the idea. But when I sat down in Jo Hansford's Mayfair salon, I found myself feeling wobbly. All around were chic-looking women with cascades of glossy hair - yet I was sacrificing my long locks for a short, deliberately scruffy bob. Was I insane? Stylist Michaela Galvin was reassuring. 'It will definitely suit your face shape,' she said. But was I too old for such a trendy look? 'Oh no! We've had all sorts of people asking for them.' The WOB brigade: Jennifer Lawrence, left, and Sienna Miller have both got the haircut . Then she sliced through six inches of hair in a single snip and there was no going back. A wob may look carefree but it's quite complicated to create. First Michaela snipped my hair off in a straight bob just below the chin. Then she set to work with thinning scissors to reduce the volume - a relief, as otherwise I could see myself with a triangular 'do' like Wendolene Ramsbottom, Wallace's love interest in A Close Shave. 'The problem is you've got about five times as much hair as Jennifer Lawrence,' Michaela explained. Once my hair was lying closer to my face, she chopped into it at the bottom to add the required touch of shagginess. Finally she added a few romantic waves with curling tongs. 'Don't curl the hair right to the end,' she counselled. 'You want to leave a little flick out at the bottom, so it looks very casual.' For the final touch she sprayed my hair with Shu Uemura's Art of Hair Texture Wave spray, which contains cottonseed oil for shine-free hold (glossiness is a no-no in a wob, apparently). Et voila! Two hours later, I had the season's ultimate un-do. Looking in the mirror, I was shocked to see air where I'd once had hair. But gradually I found myself warming to my wob. The casual waves added width to the top half of my face and made my eyes look wider and my jawline slimmer. Less time on hair styling means more time on rehearsing: Strictly Come Dancing's Caroline Flack is another fan of the style . 'Wow!' said my husband that night. My eldest daughter loved it too. 'It's epic!' she shrieked. The eight-year-old wasn't so sure. 'You look messy,' she said, fetching the hairbrush. It was next morning that the wob's real benefits started to reveal themselves. I leapt out of bed, flung on my clothes and hustled the children off to school without bothering even to comb my bed-head. But as I crashed through the school gates, I had a smug conviction that this morning I looked chic rather than shabby. Then I went to the gym and didn't get my hair caught in the machinery. My friends said I looked younger. My wob wasn't too hard to style. That night, for a party, I re-did it using my sister's hair tongs to add the waves, then glued them in with L'Oreal's Tecni-Art Fix Anti-Frizz. Not everyone liked the look. My mother was frankly puzzled. 'What does it mean?' she asked. And in truth, the style is not quite as easy to wear as its fans claim. A messy hairdo can look fabulously edgy with smoky eyes, glossy lips and a designer outfit, much less so with no make-up and yoga pants. I've cut down on hair-brushing time in the mornings but have to spend extra minutes applying mascara and lipstick. That's a small price to pay, though, for never having a 'bad hair day'. And the wob's real secret is that if you do need to look sophisticated, a few brush-strokes and a blast with the dryer can turn it into the sort of sleek bob even your mother would admire.

"Dozens of tourists were left suspended over the Thames for almost 40 minutes in sweltering conditions today when the Olympic cable car broke down. The £44m Emirates Cable Car, which transports visitors across the River Thames in east London, suffered a fault this lunchtime, leaving families and children suspended 300ft in the air for over half an hour. Transport for London said the delay was caused by a technical fault with the alarm system. The system links the 02 Arena in . Greenwich - where the Olympic basketball and gymnastics are taking place . - with the ExCel exhibition centre in London Docklands, which is . hosting boxing and a number of other events. Breakdown: Cassam Looch took this image at lunchtime today of the Emirates Cable Car after it broke down mid-flight . 30 cable cars came to a halt just before noon, suspended 60 people in mid-flight. The cable car broke down at 11.45am and was fixed by 12.18pm, leaving visitors stuck above the Thames for around 40 minutes after starting the five-minute crossing. Those travelling on the cable car also had to endure the delay in sweltering heat, as temperatures in London hit almost 28C. One passenger, Alastair Owens, tweeted: 'London Emirates cable car has broken down and we're dangling mid-air over the docks - seem to be evacuating. 'Can see cable cars closest to ground have been evacuated, but we in mid-air are being told nothing. Come on Emirates. 'If we require any assistance we have to press the emergency button. Do you think they would bring me a coffee?' Later he tweeted: 'Emirates cable car turned out to be great school holiday mini adventure - greeted with apologies and water as we landed.' Tourists about to travel over the river described how families with young children and elderly people emerged from the cable car looking 'extremely hot and flustered'.

Cassam Looch, 30, a freelance writer who was about to board the cable car just before it broke down, told MailOnline: 'A lot of people were stuck right in the middle high up over the river for well over half an hour. 'There were young children and elderly people coming off at our end afterwards looking very hot and flustered. 'The younger and older people looked like they had suffered more than anyone else up there, as there didn't seem to be water on board. There were ambulances and British Transport Police waiting at the other end to tend to those who had got stuck.' Danny Price, Head of Emirates Air Line said: 'The Emirates Air Line is now back up and running after experiencing a technical fault at 11:45am.

"The chambers led by leading Left-wing 'celebrity' barrister Michael Mansfield QC is closing down, blaming Government cutbacks to legal aid . The chambers led by leading Left-wing ‘celebrity’ barrister Michael Mansfield QC is closing down, blaming Government cutbacks to legal aid. A spokesman for Tooks Chambers said the reforms were ‘devastating’ and ‘threatening the rule of law’. It comes after a revamp was announced in April to slash £220million from the £1billion a year criminal legal aid bill. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling also wants to cut the fees paid to fat cat lawyers, reducing payments by 30 per cent in ‘very high cost cases’ that last more than 90 days. Tooks Chambers last night attacked Mr Grayling’s policies, despite admitting that 90 per cent of its barristers’ work is funded by public money. A statement on the firm’s website announced its dissolution ‘with great regret’. It added: ‘The dissolution of Chambers is the direct result of Government policies on legal aid. The public service we provide is dependent on public funding.’ The firm will cease operations on October 11 before being formally dissolved on December 27. However, it said it will try to develop ways of supporting publicly-funded lawyers who are ‘committed to continuing the struggle for social justice’. Self-styled ‘radical lawyer’ Mr Mansfield has benefited from legal aid throughout his lengthy career. He was paid £743,421 during the Saville Inquiry into Bloody Sunday, which cost taxpayers £195million. He has also been involved in some of Britain’s most significant legal cases, including Stephen Lawrence, the Birmingham Six, Jean Charles De Menezes and the inquest into the Hillsborough disaster. Mr Mansfield, currently representing the family of Mark Duggan at the inquest into his death, declined to comment further yesterday. However, a Ministry of Justice spokesman last night said the legal sector ‘cannot be immune’ from efforts to get better value for taxpayers’ money. It comes after a revamp was announced in April to slash £220million from the £1billion a year criminal legal aid bill. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling also wants to cut the fees paid to fat cat lawyers, reducing payments by up to 30 per cent . Before the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act came into effect the highest-paid QCs were making £500 a day for advocacy, plus up to £150 an hour for preparation work. Prisoners will also be restricted from accessing legal aid as well as households with a disposable income of £37,500 or more under the reforms. A Ministry of Justice spokesman added: ‘We have one of the best legal professions in the world but cannot close our eyes to the fact legal aid is costing too much. ‘All businesses have to consistently innovate and adapt to changing circumstances to remain successful. ‘At a time when major financial challenges are being felt by businesses and households across the country the legal sector cannot be immune from the Government’s commitment to getting better value for every penny of taxpayers’ money we spend.’ Mr Mansfield, who is currently representing the family of Mark Duggan at the inquest into his death, declined to add any further comment last night.","Comes after plans to slash £220million from £1billion a year legal aid bill .

"Britain's decision not to back a European law banning plastic bags has caused friction with Italy and stunned environmental campaigners. Italy's Environment Minister has criticised Britain's lack of support for the law, describing it as 'astounding' particularly for a seafaring nation. Environmental campaigners have also been left flabbergasted by Britain's move earlier this month, especially given the Coalition government's support for reducing the environmental impact of bags on the landscape and wildlife. Under threat: British beautyspots like Tynemouth, North Tyneside and marine life are under threat from the growing problem of waste plastic bags - which Britain chose not to ban under EU law . However, a Government spokesperson . said: 'While we are determined to . tackle the blight caused by discarded carrier bags, the proposed Italian . scheme is illegal under EU packaging law.' Andrea Orlando, Italy's environment minister, pointed out the risks to the environment of adopting Britain's position. Quoted in The Daily Telegraph, he . said: 'The bags are a serious problem, above all at sea, and it is . astounding that Britain, which is serious about the environment and has a . seafaring tradition going back centuries, does not want to defend the . seas from plastic pollution which suffocates and kills many marine . animals.' Three years ago, Italy's coastline had one of the worst records for plastic bag pollution; Italians consumed one quarter of all Europe’s single-use plastic shopping bags. A study showed that plastic bags accounted for 72 per cent of the waste washed up on its coasts. But since 2011, Italy has introduced a ban on supply of the carrier bags; supermarkets and shops are only allowed to provide biodegradable plastic bags or thicker reusable ones. The Mediterranean country now wants to go one step further; to be able to impose fines on shops that fail to comply with the rules. To do this, it needs an EU law to rubber stamp the ban. Eyesore: The Daily Mail's Banish The Bags campaign calls on companies and politicians to reduce the number of plastic bags . This month a report by the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) revealed that for every mile of Britain's coastline, there are on average 72 disposable shopping bags washed up. The problem is also getting worse. To tackle the growing problem, Scotland has pledged to introduce charges and . Wales and Northern Ireland have already imposed fees resulting in bag . use dropping by up to 96 per cent in some supermarkets. The Daily Mail also backs a move to rid the country of plastic bags, with its Banish the Bags campaign – which calls on companies and politicians to reduce the number of plastic bags in our countryside and rivers. But England has fallen short of imposing a ban. Environmental charity Friends of the Earth has campaigned for years for plastic . bags to be banned as long as alternatives are adequately highlighted, . people and shopkeepers have enough time to prepare, and it does not have . a 'disproportionate impact on the poor'. British ex-pat and waste expert David Newman, who lives in Rome called the British position 'astonishing'. Mr Newman, head of the Italian . Composting Association, told the Telegraph: 'The UK has been called to . order on this at home yet it is opposing it in Brussels – it’s . paradoxical.'","Britain blocked a ban on plastic bags in the EU earlier this month .

The video was taken around 6 pm when the store's doors opened on Thursday. Other videos have emerged showing the violence underway across the country's stores as determined shoppers battle for the best Black Friday bargains. They come after reports of a thief shooting a man for his new TV in Las Vegas, one man stabbing another over a parking space in Virginia and cops shooting a would-be shoplifter in Chicago. One video posted to YouTube shows the chaos over DVD players, Garmin GPS systems and other items at a Walmart in Saginaw near Fort Worth, Texas. Must-have item: The customers were shopping for this 15-piece Rachael Ray set for $89, down from $199.99 . Police in one Walmart store were on hand to break up a fight between two woman over a flat-screen television . The woman collapses to the ground, all the time trying to hold on to the TV, while the officer proceeds with an arrest . Customers knock down entire stands holding phones to get their hands on cheaper Blu-ray and DVD players as staff struggle to keep them under control. Eventually police officers arrive on the scene to break up the chaos. Much of the violence is apparently occuring at Walmarts, with Twitter useers even adopting a hashtag '#WalmartFights' to document the most outrageous spats. 'Walmart is like a war zone,' one Twitter user wrote. 'Fight to the death to get the s*** you want.' Another added: 'I have never felt more shame for humanity than I do right now watching people in Walmart fight over a tv, Alabama bookbag & a $14 blender.'

One other disgruntled shopper, from McKinney, Texas, added: 'NEVER will I go to Walmart black Friday again I got stuck in the middle of a fight over a stupid tablet. if you wanna see crazy go there.' But Walmart spokesperson Brooke Buchanan told The Huffington Post such incidents don't accurately depict the retailer's successful day. 'We've got great feedback from customers and associates across the country,' Buchanan said. 'A few tweets aren't representative of what's actually happening at 4,600 stores.' Major incidents have also occurred outside shops, including a man shooting a shopper in the leg as he left a Target in Las Vegas with his new television.

Shots also rang out in Chicago, after a police officer chased an alleged shoplifted to a waiting car. The man trapped the officer's arm inside the car door and then proceeded to drag him along. Only when another officer fired shots at the car - striking the driver in the arm - did the vehicle stop. And in yet another brutal incident, two men argued over a parking space in Tazewell County, Virginia before one man used a knife to cut the other in the arm, slicing down to the bone.","Footage shows shoppers in Tennessee grabbing boxes of the 15-piece cookware set for $89 - down from $199.99 .

"Doctors have warned that our unwavering love of bacon could be sending us to an early grave. Figures released last week revealed that bacon sales in the U.S. rose by nearly 10 per cent last year to an all time record of $4 billion. And research by pork supplier supplier Smithfield found that 65 per cent of Americans were behind the idea of making bacon the country's 'national food'. Figures released last week revealed that bacon sales in the U.S. rose by nearly 10 per cent last year to an all time record of $4 billion. But doctors say unprocessed meat increases the risk of heart disease, cancer and diabetes . But medical experts have repeatedly warned of the dangers of eating too much processed meat, as it has been linked to cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Worse still, the legendary pairing of bacon and maple syrup is even more damaging, Harvard scientists have warned. They say when bacon or sausages are combined with sugar, this makes our craving for the meat worse -  a phenomenon known as 'food trifecta'. This is defined as the irresistible trio of fat, salt, and sugar, Live Science reports. Previous research has pinpointed the exact chemical reaction that makes bacon so smell so tempting. Called the Maillard reaction, it occurs between an amino acid and a reducing sugar when heated. The acid and sugar react to release a huge amount of smells and flavour that make us salivate. The legendary pairing of bacon and maple syrup is even more damaging, experts warn. They say when bacon or sausages are combined with sugar, this makes our craving for the meat worse -  a phenomenon known as 'food trifecta' Another theory is that the meat has a special savoury taste called 'umami'. This is the Japanese word for the fifth basic sense of taste, after bitter, salty, sour and sweet - and is the main reason why we like foods such as cheese, bacon and soy sauce. But experts are increasingly concerned about how much processed meat we are all eating. Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health have found that eating processed meat, such as bacon, sausage or processed deli meats, was associated with a 42 per cent higher risk of heart disease and a 19 per cent  higher risk of Type 2 diabetes. Previous research has pinpointed the exact chemical reaction that makes bacon so smell so tempting. Called the Maillard reaction, it occurs between an amino acid and a reducing sugar when heated. The acid and sugar react to release a huge amount of smells and flavour that make us salivate. Elin . Roberts, of the Centre for Life education centre in Newcastle, . explained the reaction releases hundreds of smells and flavours, but it . is the smell which reels in the eater. 'If we couldn't smell, then taste wouldn't be the same.' But they did not find any higher risk of heart disease or diabetes among individuals eating unprocessed red meat, such as from beef, pork, or lamb. Researcher Renata Micha said: 'When we looked at average nutrients in unprocessed red and processed meats eaten in the United States, we found that they contained similar average amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol. 'In contrast, processed meats contained, on average, four times more sodium (salt) and 50 per cent more nitrate preservatives.' This suggests that differences in salt and preservatives, rather than fats, might explain the higher risk of heart disease and diabetes seen with processed meats, but not with unprocessed red meats.' Salt is known to increase blood pressure, a strong risk factor for heart disease. In animal experiments, nitrate preservatives can promote hardening of the arteries and reduce glucose tolerance, effects which could increase risk of heart disease and diabetes. To lower . risk of heart attacks and diabetes, people should consider which types . of meats they are eating, she said. 'Processed meats - such as bacon, salami, sausages, hot dogs . and processed deli meats - may be the most important to avoid. Based on . our findings, eating one serving per week or less would be associated . with relatively small risk.' Last year, a massive number-crunching exercise has revealed that . dishes with bacon really do taste better - and very few taste worse. Tech magazine Wired teamed up with the Food Network to analyse 50,000 recipes and 906,539 comments on them. Last year, a massive number-crunching exercise revealed that dishes with bacon - sandwiches in particular - really do taste better . Explaining . how the results were calculated, Wired writer Cliff Kuang said: 'First, . we searched out all the recipes that fit a certain description - . sandwiches, for example. 'Then, we calculated the average rating for those foods if they did not include the word “bacon.” 'We . ran the numbers again using only recipes that did include bacon. Of all . the foods we analysed, bacon lends the most improvement to sandwiches.' Many . other dishes also got a boost when bacon was added - when the data was . analysed, those with with a rasher or two included got better scores. There . are various theories as to why - not least because of the crunch and . flavour bacon adds to sandwiches. It's also a good addition to salads - . providing it doesn't go soggy. Recipes with spinach and asparagus were all rated better when they contained bacon, for example. But . it wasn't all good news. There are foods that get worse with bacon - . namely pasta (particularly in creamy sauces) and, rather unsurprisingly, . desserts.","U.S. sales rose by nearly 10% last year to an all-time record of $4 billion .

"A stalker raped a pregnant woman and then forced her to breastfeed him after she gave birth. Kevin Gibbons, 50, caused immense psychological damage to the woman and another victim - both of whom he subjected to horrifying sex crimes. Gibbons abused the women then quoted passages from the Bible to justify his depraved actions. Jailed: Kevin Gibbons, 50, abused two women and then quoted passages from the Bible to justify his  actions . His terrorising behaviour, which included stalking, came to light when by a twist of fate, both women ended up living in the same street and the police learnt of their ordeals. A Greater Manchester Police detective described him as 'one of the most vile, controlling, abusive and cowardly men I have ever encountered during all my years in policing'. Gibbons, of Standish, Wigan, was found guilty of 11 charges, including stalking, rape, false imprisonment and sexual assault, following a trial. He was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court yesterday for 25 years. The court heard how Gibbons targeted his two victims for more than a decade, subjecting them to physical, verbal and sexual abuse, harassment and stalking to the point both felt 'hunted' and prisoners in their homes. His first victim said she feels he has 'sucked the life out of me' and the judge said she remains extremely fragile. His other victim, whom he raped while she was pregnant and then made breastfeed him when she had given birth, had a breakdown and was suicidal for a time. On one occasion, he forced her to have sex and filmed it and then threatened to reveal it to others. Gibbons was found guilty of 11 charges and sentenced to 25 years in prison at Liverpool Crown Court for subjecting two women to horrific sexual ordeals . One victim was forced to keep her curtains closed as Gibbons repeatedly drove past and parked outside her home. He intimidated her where she worked, bombarded her with unwanted photos, cards, letters and messages and left her in total fear of living her life. When his car and home were searched, officers found a collection of knives and even a bow and arrow he kept in his car while he stalked the women. Gibbons also locked one victim in her bedroom and refused to allow her to leave if she simply disagreed with him and could only bargain for her freedom by having sex. His second victim was repeatedly raped and sexually abused. Det Con Sheena Maerevoet said: 'The facts of this appalling case speak for themselves. Gibbons is one of the most vile, controlling, abusive and cowardly men I have ever encountered during all my years in policing and I have no hesitation in saying that he deserves every second of his lengthy prison sentence. 'At the heart of this investigation are two innocent women who were subjected to years of horrific sexual and physical abuse. 'These women felt unable to cope, prisoners in their own home, hunted and haunted by Gibbons to the point they felt like they could not even go to the shops. In some instances, both felt like dying. 'That is an utterly heartbreaking and tragic indictment of just how abusive Gibbons was. 'Not only that, but he showed zero remorse and failed to take responsibility, subjecting these women to the terrifying ordeal of having to relive what happened in the adversarial environment at court. 'Their bravery cannot be overstated. Despite everything they have suffered, they showed true courage to give evidence at court and thanks to their tenacity and refusal to allow Gibbons to get away with it, an extremely dangerous man is now behind bars.' During his sentencing report, Judge David Aubrey told Liverpool Crown Court: 'The harm you have caused has been immense and long-standing. 'You are, and remain, a significant risk of causing women serious sexual and psychological harm. You are, and remain, a dangerous person.'","Kevin Gibbons raped a pregnant woman and forced her to breastfeed him .

"America's secretive spy agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, has been in possession of two space telescopes which are better than Hubble - and has now decided to gift them to NASA. Sources say that the reason for the . hand-me-down is because the NRO - motto: 'Vigilance from above' - has . found even better technology. The revelations leads to questions over how long the NRO has had the satellites - which are said to have 100 times the field of view of Hubble - and what exactly they were planning to use them for. A satellite spy company gifted NASA with two Hubble telescopes after they said they had better technology available for newer telescopes (file photo) The space agency has confirmed that . it received a pair of giant identical Hubble telescopes, and said the . spy agency built them and then decided it didn't need them. So, having decided they had no use . for them, the NRO has now gifted the pair, which have been sat in their . original wrappers in a warehouse in Rochester, New York, to the space . agency. The trouble is, NASA is too cash-strapped to refurbish them - until at least 2024. Even with this windfall, NASA has no money to launch the telescopes anytime soon. They have consistently been dealing with smaller budgets and fewer staff members. The transfer last summer was only recently declassified. The telescopes have mirrors similar in size to the famed Hubble Space Telescope, but they are not ready for space - not by a long shot. For starters, they lack cameras and instruments essential for astronomy research. The equipment costs money - around $1billion, according to some estimates. Dr Spergel, a member of the National Academy of Science’s Committee on Astrophysics and Astronomy told Time: ‘A 50 per cent discount still means you have to come up with the other 50 per cent.’ One man's trash: While the telescopes were given to NASA free of charge, they do not have the funds to launch them into space (file photo) The final frontier: The astrophysics director for NASA said that he hopes to launch the telescopes by 2024, or sooner, 'if money is no object' (file photos) NASA astrophysics director Paul Hertz told the Washington Post that the soonest NASA could hope to launch the telescopes was in 2024, but said they might launch earlier ‘if money is no object.’ He added that the initial framework means less overhead, and more that can potentially be spent on newer technologies. In total, the massive gifts will likely save the space agency some $250million down the road. However, until scientists have enough money for launches, the telescopes will remain in the upstate New York warehouse. Neither the NRO or NASA would release pictures of the two telescopes. Scientists hope NASA will repurpose one of the telescopes to study dark energy, the mysterious force that could explain the universe’s expansion.","NASA gifted two telescopes by spy agency National Reconnaissance Office .

"Next time you develop an embarrassing itch or lump, you might want to reconsider turning to health websites to diagnose your symptoms. A researcher has discovered that a number of major health websites are 'leaking' web users’ search terms to third-party advertising and marketing companies. And while there is no evidence that the information obtained is being misused, Professor Marco Huesch said that failure to address concerns about his findings may diminish trust in health-related websites. The study made clear that there is no evidence that any company is misusing the information that web users 'give' them, but said failure to address concerns may diminish trust in health-related websites and reduce the willingness of people to use them . In theory, he said, the data could make it possible to identify an individual user's health conditions. Professor Huesch, of the University . of Southern California-Los Angeles and Duke business school, used freely . available interception software to monitor 20 leading health websites. Popular websites used in the research included WebMD, Weight Watchers, Men's Health and NHS UK. By entering search terms such as 'herpes', 'cancer' or 'depression' into their search engines, he discovered that all 20 sites used at least one method to track its users. Shockingly, on average the sites used six or seven different ways to track their webpage visitors. A 'tracking element' is a long-acting computer script that reports to a third party - such as an marketing company - about a user's online behaviour on a website. Professor Heusch also found that 13 of the 20 websites contained one or more tracking elements while five of the 13 sites that had trackers had also enabled social media button tracking. No tracking elements were found on doctor-oriented sites closely tied to professional groups however. A 'tracking element' is a long-acting . computer script that reports to a third party - such as a marketing . company - about a user's online behaviour at a website. NHS . MedicalNews Daily/Mdlinx .

National Cancer Institute . 'A patient who searches on a ""free"" health-related website for information related to ‘herpes’ should be able to assume that the inquiry is anonymous,' wrote Professor Huesch. 'If not anonymous, the information knowingly or unknowingly disclosed by the patient should not be divulged to others. Unfortunately, neither assumption may be true.' Huesch worries that the data passed on to third parties could be used in combination with tracking and other information obtained from social media websites to create highly revealing profiles of individual users. 'In theory, someone could build up a very powerful document with all of your medical conditions, the drugs you're taking, where you work, who your relatives are, where you live, and other personal information,' Huesch told The Verge. He is not entirely against targeted . advertising however - a common tactic employed by many sites to allow . advertisers to serve-up ads based on a user's browsing history. He just believes that the current situation, where the industry largely polices itself, is not ideal. 'There's a balance to be found there, but right now, we're too far in one direction.' Heusch made it clear in his write-up however, that he has no evidence that any company is misusing . the information or creating the profiles he described. But he still believes action needs to be taken. He said: 'Failure to address these concerns may diminish trust in health-related websites and reduce the willingness of some people to access health-related information online.'

"Two of the most powerful forces in the world, money and public opinion, have conspired to bring about the richest and most anticipated fight in boxing history. The cash takes the form of the minimum $150million (£96m) which Floyd Mayweather is being guaranteed to fight Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2. The psychological pressure came to a head when the man who calls himself ‘Money’ was besieged by fans at an NBA game. Chanting: ‘We want Manny,’ they clamoured for him to face up to the Filipino congressman who is his only realistic challenger for the mythical title of greatest pound-for-pound boxer on earth. Floyd Mayweather has  confirmed he will face Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2 . Floyd Mayweather posted this image to his Instagram account on Friday  shortly after announcing the fight . Those two elements did more than anything to coax Mayweather out of his five-year hesitation about putting his cherished unbeaten record at its most serious risk yet as he approaches, at coming up 38 this week, the climax to a magnificent career. These factors mattered more within the Mayweather psyche than all those protracted, convoluted negotiations. Pacquiao's acceptance of the smaller share of the booty, the poor chap is only on $100m (£64m) plus bonuses for one night’s work in the MGM Grand Garden Arena, HBO and Showtime agreeing to share the US pay-per-view broadcast, each boxer wearing his favourite gloves, 'Money' having the honour of entering the ring second, the PacMan saying yes to Olympic standard drugs testing……all these issues and more were mere obstacles waiting to be hurdled by negotiation. Mayweather shared the official signed contract for the fight via his Shots social media account on Friday . Egos, pecking orders and the settling of old scores had been the immovable barriers for so long that we had come to fear never seeing the two finest boxers of their generation in the same ring. Incredibly, Mayweather and Pacquiao had never even been in the same room until they happened to spy each across the court at a subsequent basketball game. Hallelujah, that chance meeting helped Mayweather gratify the control freak in his personality. It was he who invited Pacquiao into conversation and thus he could rightly claim the credit for ending their stand-off. AS SPORTSMAIL REVEALED: Click here to read how Jeff Powell told when the big fight would be announced . But lest we forget, Pacquiao has always declared himself ready and willing and quickly made the concessions to prove it. Still, a myriad of detail was still to be settled but all that really remained was for Mayweather to score a point against his old enemy, Pacquiao's veteran promoter Bob Arum, with whom he had vowed never to work again. That he did by demanding the right to make the announcement that the fight is on. His delays in so doing gave everyone the jitters but by then his arm had been well and truly twisted. Pacquiao and Mayweather were pictured together for the first time at the basketball game last month . He will come to be grateful that it was because this fight will cement his considerable legacy in the hardest game – win, lose or draw. Just in time, Mayweather is honouring the tradition of such Hall of Fame noblemen as Sugar Ray Leonard, Tommy Hearns, Marvin Hagler, Roberto Duran, Tito Trinidad and Oscar De La Hoya – who fought each other without fear of defeat because they knew that only by doing so could they claim their seat in the pantheon. You know he senses that importance when he says now: ‘This is my chance to prove myself T.B.E……the best ever.’ Yes, that ego is still in brash working order but more importantly he is doing the right thing by the sport which had made him phenomenally rich and controversially famous. Miami Heat projected the two fighters onto the big screen and asked the question: 'Coming in 2015?' Boxing is grateful, also, and never mind that hindsight may reveal that he played a clever game in delaying this inevitable fight until it became this gigantic financial bonanza. The worldwide audience of millions will stretch way beyond the core enthusiasts for the hard old game, out across the spectrum of society to engage a new generation. The calculating genius of Mayweather has kept him beyond defeat. Pacquiao the cavalier has exposed himself to the odd loss, while exciting the masses. Thus there is the prospect of a classic battle of styles – Mayweather’s scientific technique, refined skills and mastery of the noble art of self defence against the southpaw fury, sustained aggression, knock-out power and non-stop punching of Pacquiao. Mayweather last fought when he beat Marcos Maidana in the pair's rematch last September in Las Vegas . If that materialises, these two fighting men can transform boxing into a major sport overnight. The instant stampede of enthusiasm suggests that is happening already. The MGM sold out all its 5,005 rooms within 15 minutes of Mayweather firing the starting gun on line. The base room rate for the nights of May 1st and 2nd is upward of $500. Accommodation is already hard find all over the Strip. Tickets for ringside seats, expected face value $5,000 (£3,300), are already appearing on the black market at up to $20,000 (£13,000). Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau last November . Showtime and HBO are preparing to charge a record $99.95 (£65) for a pay-per-view subscription. All the MGM properties will screen closed circuit transmission on giants screens, entrance fee $200 (£130) plus. Millions in the Philippines will watch on giant screens in city squares and parks. A bidding war is under way for TV rights in at least 200 countries outside the US, the UK included with Sky, BT, BoxNation and perhaps ITV in contention. With the combined purse for Mayweather and Pacquiao totalling at least $250 million, projections for the value of the event are rising from an initial $300 million to close on half a billion. If that comes to pass – and there are ten weeks of promotional hype and hysteria to come - the rewards for the combatants will increase. This was an offer that Mr Money-bags could not refuse. Not that the world would let him.","Floyd Mayweather to take on Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2 .

"Alexander Aveiro Tahiri (pictrued) says there was ‘hugging and kissing’ but no sexual assault when he met Serena Bowes . This is the Italian nightclub worker who accuses a British fashion student of crying rape. Alexander Aveiro Tahiri, 23, says there was ‘hugging and kissing’ but no sexual assault when he met Serena Bowes, 21, in a Florence nightclub in May. Miss Bowes fears she could be extradited to Italy after police took his side – saying she had made up the claim that she was attacked in a toilet. She has been served notice that she will go on trial for ‘slander’ against Mr Tahiri, a charge carrying a maximum penalty of 12 years in prison. Police in Florence told the Mail she could be tried in her absence and arrested if she ever set foot in Italy. They said it was normal procedure for alleged sex assault victims to be accused of slander if there was doubt about the attack. In the case of Miss Bowes, who has waived her right to anonymity, they said detectives had viewed video footage from the nightclub and concluded her rape claim was false. Miss Bowes had hoped to put the harrowing event behind her when she returned home from the trip to the Tuscan city with 20 other students from her fashion course at Newcastle College. On the second day of their trip, some of the group ventured to the Full Up club in the city centre, where Miss Bowes started talking to a man. As they were walking to the VIP section of the club, Miss Bowes claims he dragged her into a unisex toilet and raped her. After a while she said she heard a friend, who had grown concerned about her, calling her name and she dashed out of the cubicle on her own, and left the nightclub with her friend. Miss Bowes, a second-year student, went to hospital on the night of the incident, and then to a police station to give a statement. She denies claims that she kissed her alleged attacker after they came out of the toilet. But a police source told the Mail: ‘They were hugging and kissing after coming out of the toilet. This is what the nightclub [CCTV] video shows and what witnesses told us. The hospital told us there were no signs of any injuries or assault on her body.’ Ordeal: Serena Bowes fears she could be extradited to Italy after police took Mr Tahiri's side . College visit: Miss Bowes, who is in her second year at Newcastle College, was on the trip to the Italian city of Florence in May as part of her fashion course . The source said Mr Tahiri had turned himself in after reading about the alleged rape in a local newspaper. ‘He came to a police station to say it wasn’t rape, it wasn’t true. He wasn’t arrested or formally questioned because he was not considered a suspect. From the evidence we had, we concluded the girl was not raped. ‘He [Mr Tahiri] made the request for the authorities to pursue a slander case against the girl, and that is what the public prosecutor is now doing.’ A source at the nightclub said Mr Tahiri was a promoter whose job was to drum up business by handing out flyers to drinkers in nearby bars. He said: ‘Alex told us that he did not rape the girl and we believe him because the video shows them together after they came out of the toilet. When the police saw the video, they said “Forget it”. ‘But we told Alex he could not work here any more because having sex in the toilets is not what he is being paid for.’ As they were walking to the VIP section of the club, Miss Bowes claims a man dragged her into a unisex toilet and raped her . He said Mr Tahiri is of Moroccan origin and was raised in the northern Italian city of Mantua. He has a day job at a Florence travel agency, targeting tourists with offers of trips to attractions such as Verona and Assisi. Yesterday Mr Tahiri did not show up for work and was said to be unavailable for comment. Miss Bowes, from Walker, Newcastle, is furious detectives did not believe her. She said: ‘The police just didn’t care – they were rude and disrespectful. Through my translator, they just said: “Well, this happens every day in Florence”. ‘My life feels like it has gone and I have no control of what is happening. I feel like there’s a ticking time-bomb over my head.’ The Foreign Office said it was providing consular assistance.","Alexander Aveiro Tahiri says he did not sexually assault Serena Bowes .

"More than 600,000 white British Londoners have left the capital in a decade. Census figures show that between 2001 and 2011 the level of ‘white flight’ reached 620,000. It is the equivalent of a city the size of Glasgow – made up entirely of white Britons – moving out of the capital. White Britons are now a minority in the country's capital with 620,000 leaving in a decade . The figures, reported by the BBC . yesterday, mean that for the first time, white Britons are now in a . minority in the country’s largest city. At the same time, the census shows, . some rural areas have seen a rise in the proportion of people who . describe their ethnicity as ‘white British’. Some 3.7million Londoners classified . themselves as white British in 2011 – down from 4.3million in 2001 – . despite the city’s population increasing by nearly one million over the . decade to 8.2million. Sir Andrew Green of MigrationWatch thinks that the BBC should have addressed such a serious issue less trivially . White Britons now make up 45 per cent of the population, compared with 58 per cent in 2001. London’s population has been boosted by immigrants. Three million foreign-born people now live in the capital. Five London boroughs saw the . proportion of white Britons fall by more than a quarter. The largest . decline was in Newham, East London, where the decrease was 37.5 per . cent. In Barking and Dagenham, on the East . London/Essex border, 80 per cent of residents were white British in 2001 . but by 2011 the proportion was 49 per cent. There were also big falls in . Redbridge, Harrow, Brent, Enfield, Ealing and Waltham Forest. The BBC . website was criticised by readers for its depiction of the change as a . ‘story of success’ in which many white Britons had moved out to live by . the sea or in the countryside. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the . MigrationWatch think-tank, said: ‘The BBC make a very serious mistake in . addressing an issue of such importance to the British public in such a . trivial and superficial manner. ‘It’s surely obvious that the main . reason for white flight is because people are not willing to live in an . environment which has changed beyond recognition and against their own . wishes.’ Ralph Baldwin, a Tory councillor in Barking and Dagenham, said: ‘I think people left for a variety of reasons. ‘If you look back to the early 2000s . many people were able to retire to Clacton-on-Sea and they saw their . friends going and followed. ‘But people also watched all this . demographic change going on between 2000 and 2010 and they thought, “We . don’t know where we are living any more”. ‘One day they are in a place that they think is Essex and then they are living in another place. ‘It has never been an issue of race. It’s about the inability of people . to affect change. The world was changing around them and they couldn’t . do anything about it.’ Behind white Britons, the largest . ethnic group in London is now Asians – including those born here and . those arriving from overseas – who make up 18 per cent of the . population. Black Londoners – including Africans, black Britons and those from the Caribbean – make up 13 per cent. The census shows the proportion of white Britons in South Derbyshire went up by 13.7 per cent over the decade. Other rural boroughs that saw big . increases included North Kesteven and West Lindsey in Lincolnshire, . Uttlesford in Essex, East Northamptonshire, East Cambridgeshire, Mid . Suffolk, South Norfolk, Mid Devon and Forest Heath in Suffolk. The census shows the population of . England and Wales was swollen by nearly four million immigrants in a . decade of sweeping social change. In 2011 there were 7.5million people who were born abroad living here, of whom more than half had arrived since 2001.","Census figures show that 620,000 white Britons left the capital in a decade .

"Terror chiefs have instructed militants to target oil tankers passing through the Gibraltar Strait on their way to the west in a bid to wreak havoc on the economy, experts claim. Jihadis have been told to sabotage the journey of thousands of tankers either with explosives or by hijacking cargo ships and run them aground. The plans were revealed in a new al-Qaeda magazine, Resurgence, which also described British oil workers in the Middle East as at risk. Terrorists are reportedly planning to target oil tankers and cargo ships passing through the Gibraltar Strait used by thousands of maritime vessels every year (file image) More than 100,000 ships pass through the Straight between Morocco and Europe every year including an estimated 5,000 oil tankers headed for the West. 'This is not the first time threats have been made to target merchant ships passing through the Strait, a Gibraltar government source told the Sunday Express. Alongside threats to the Rock of Gibraltar, al-Qaeda chiefs will instruct fighters to sabotage tankers at the Strait of Hormuz, between Oman and Iran, and in parts of Egypt. While always a fragile operation, the transportation of oil overseas has become increasingly threatened by terrorists in recent years. The Gibraltar Strait is responsible for the transporting of thousands of gallons of oil to the West . Following the atrocities of September 11, NATO launched Operation Active Endeavour as part of its anti-terrorism mandates. It is not the first time al-Qaeda, whose leader Osama Bin Laden was killed by US forces in 2011, has attempted to target oil tankers . Thousands of NATO ships patrol the Gibraltar Strait as well as other 'choke' points in contributing countries to thwart terrorist activity. A statement on the Treaty's website said: 'Keeping the Mediterranean’s busy trade routes open and safe is critical to NATO’s security. 'In terms of energy alone, some 65 per cent of the oil and natural gas consumed in Western Europe pass through the Mediterranean each year, with major pipelines connecting Libya to Italy and Morocco to Spain. 'For this reason, NATO ships are systematically carrying out preparatory route surveys in “choke” points as well as in important passages and harbours throughout the Mediterranean.' Last year Yemeni authorities claimed to have foiled an elaborate plot by the terrorist group to take control of its ports and of the al-Dhaba oil terminal. It came after a suspected US drone killed seven militants in the country last August. Part of their plan reportedly involved jihadis dressing up in Yemeni army uniforms to infiltrate the Canadian-owned al-Dhaba oil terminal, responsible for a significant portion of the country's oil exports. They were also rumoured to have planned to blow up oil pipelines.","al-Qaeda chiefs have reportedly instructed militants to target Gibraltar Strait .

"Move aside Grandpa Munster, there’s a new coffin car in town – and it’s powered by a jet engine. Oregon inventor Robert Maddox gave the Dragula coffin car - made famous in the 1960s children’s TV show The Munsters - a 21st century facelift by adding two pulse jets. The engine in the Maddoxjets Coffin Car weighs 300lbs and can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in nine seconds – faster than a Toyota Prius. Scroll down for video . The Coffin Car, pictured, was created by pulsejet expert Robert Maddox. It is made of wood and the undercarriage consists of steel tubing with a Maddoxjets Thrust Super Dragon Pulsejet Engine under the seat. During tests, Maddox reached speeds of 60mph but doesn't 'dare' go faster . A pulsejet engine is a type of engine in which the combustion happens in loud pulses and is fired by jets.

Thrust Augmentor (PETA), and plans to use pulse jet engines to lift . military and commercial aircraft vertically from a standing position. Maddox specialises in creating vehicles powered by pulsejet engines, and sells plans to his designs as well parts on his website. Previous inventions include the Acme jet skateboard and the jet-powered Cyclone 50 bicycle. ‘It’s definitely the only jet-powered coffin car in the world, powered by pulse jets – I’ve never seen another one like it,’ explained Maddox. He added he drove the car up to 60mph but didn't 'dare' to go faster, admitting he had trouble breathing when driving it. The coffin is made of wood, the undercarriage is steel tubing with a Maddoxjets Thrust Super Dragon Pulsejet Engine that has been bent to go under the seat. The front end . is a 34 Ford drop axle and the coffin has a five gallon air tank. While the cockpit features three switches; . the left-hand switch turns the spark air on and the other two switches . control the ‘snake venom’ fuel that powers the engines. 'I remembered seeing a schematic of a pulsejet in an encyclopedia when I was a teenager and that is where I started, but there wasn’t anyone to copy so I ended up re-inventing a lot,' Maddox told MailOnline. Maddox designed his coffin car after being inspired by Grandpa Munster's Dragula vehicle, pictured, made famous in the 1960s children's TV show The Munsters . Grandpa Munster, pictured, was played in the TV show by Al Lewis. The original model of the Dragula, pictured, featured a 350 horsepower, Ford Mustang V8 engine . He continued he had been fascinated by the possibility of creating a coffin car since he was a child: 'I actually grew up on top of old graveyard hill in Phoenix, Oregon and had graves right under by bed. 'The old cemetery was supposed to have been moved to the new cemetery in 1900, but back then if there were no living kin they would just move the head stone not the coffin. When I was little my Dad dug a swimming pool and hit four graves.' 'I always loved The Munsters, Addams Family and Halloween - naturally since I was known as the kid that lived on graveyard hill - and always wanted a coffin car like Grandpa Munster built.' Maddox's coffin car took a month to build and cost $1,300 (£814). The coffin car can go from 0 to 60 in nine seconds.

"Australians should brace themselves for the possibility for a 'wave' of terrorist attacks because it could well occur, a terrorism expert has warned. Following the anti-terrorism raids, Rohan Gunaratna, a leading analyst on Islamic radical movement, told The Australian that authorities should act now to ensure the public would respond appropriately and react normally on the likelihood of homegrown attacks. 'Australia should prepare for not only the continual flow of fighters to Syria and Iraq but also a wave of terrorist attacks on Australian soil,' he told The Australian. 'It is very likely that there will be low and medium-level ­attacks that will create a very significant impact and will impact the migrant and diaspora communities.' Scroll down for video . Abu Khaled from Australia, thought to be Abdullah Elmir, speaks flanked by other ISIS fighters in the latest ISIS propaganda video . Gunaratna's warning comes just days after a Muslim convert, who shot dead a soldier when he opened fire at Canada's Parliament on Wednesday morning. Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was gunned down after he shot Coporal Nathan Cirillo, 24, who was keeping guard at the War Memorial. In a video tirade this week, a rescue mission to save ginger jihadist, Abdullah Elmir, 17, had to be aborted at the last minute, with fears those involved could be charged for assisting the teen, if he was found. The Sydney teenager gained notoriety, when he ran away from his Bankstown home with friend 'Fayez' in June, and declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in a Youtube video. The father of the 16-year-old, known as 'Fayez', who accompanied Elmir to the Middle East said his son is 'back on the right path' and has returned to school in Sydney to sit his HSC exams . According to the HeraldSun, relatives in Sydney and Elmir's father in Lebanon tried to assemble a team, including a Sydney man who believed he could get in contact with the teenager, to find him. Channel seven's Sunday Night program was also expected to travel with the group. But major concerns surrounded whether the team, if they found Elmir and gave him assistance, could be charged under the federal government's foreign incursion laws. The 17 year old could face 25 years in jail if he ever sets foot on Australian soil again. The Australian Federal Police have confirmed the evidence is being prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions following his ISIS video rant against western society. AFP counterterrorism head Neil Gaughan told the Herald Sun that Elmir, who now goes by the moniker Abu Khaled, has 'basically admitted he is a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation'. 'The fact that he is admitting that he is a member of ISIS, which he does in the video, straight away says that he has committed an offence under the criminal code. That’s up to 25 years imprisonment,' he said. While most of his closest mates either closed ranks behind him or were too upset to speak, one of his childhood friends admitted to being in a state of shock . Mark Llewellyn, executive producer of Sunday Night told the Sun Herald they had been approached by people who had concerns for Elmir. 'It was felt that at this early stage before he had been radicalised, it might be possible for members of his Sydney Muslim community to negotiate his exit from IS, especially given his young age,' he said. Despite claims there was mounting pressure from federal agencies not to communicate with the media, Mr Llewellyn said the Australian Federal Police denied they 'place contact restrictions on members of the public'. 'We were informed these warnings also included the Muslim representatives who eventually pulled out of the plan.' 'For the record, we did not offer or attempt to negotiate any story fee.' Distraught classmates from Condell Park High School, in Sydney's south-west, painted a picture of a complex young man on Thursday, describing him as both 'very quiet' while also someone who 'enjoyed politicking' Meanwhile, the father of the 16-year-old, known as 'Fayez', who accompanied Elmir to the Middle East said his son is 'back on the right path' and has returned to school in Sydney to sit his HSC exams, according to Herald Sun. While Elmir's friends have admitted that  Elmir,  who this week appeared in a YouTube video rant, was 'expected' to run away to the Middle East. 'Some expected it, like he used to talk about it a bit,' a friend told Daily Mail Australia. Distraught classmates from Condell Park High School, in Sydney's south-west, painted a picture of a complex young man on Thursday, describing him as both 'very quiet' and someone who 'enjoyed politicking'. Australian security agencies are analysing the vision to determine whether a bearded man to Elmir's right is Mohamed Elomar, (one of the country's most wanted) the ISIS recruit believed responsible for radicalising and luring dozens of Australians to take up arms in the Middle East. While most of his best mates either closed ranks behind him or were too upset to speak, one of his childhood friends admitted to being in a state of shock. 'Yeah man, he's my friend and I don't want to talk about him,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'He was my mate but I don't talk about him'. But the teenage terrorist was described by another classmate as being 'very quiet, he was a good kid, we used to pray together at our mosque'. 'He did a little bit of debating here, he liked knowing politics and did some politicking but he was mostly very quiet and never, ever got into trouble,' he said. 'Abdullah was in theatre groups at school and he liked playing basketball a lot.' When asked if he was one of those who thought Abdullah was capable of running away, he added 'no, no I didn't expect that but I know a few of his other friends say they heard him mention it'. Professor Greg Barton, from Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, said Elmir was recruited by another wanted terrorist, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, an Australian based in Syria. He said terror recruiters lured targets by making friends through social media, like many sexual predators. He said the boy appeared as a 'pawn in the machine' in the chilling video. 'He thinks he's the star ... but the reality is, his new friends have got him a one-way ticket,' Professor Barton said. 'He's not in charge of his own destiny at all, he's being used.' Professor Barton added that young people were the easiest to radicalise. Bearded ISIS fighters, holding rifles, flank the Australian jihadi as he preaches hate . 'Teenagers, 20-somethings, particularly young men more than young women, are vulnerable to making rash judgments,' he said. 'They tend to be more rebellious toward [older] generations and sceptical of establishment figures.' It is believed former Kings Cross bouncer Baryalei, 33, recruited Elmir through western Sydney street preaching group Parramatta Street Dawah. 'He's said to have recruited 30 plus young people - mostly in western Sydney through Street Dawah,' Prof Barton said. Before Elmir joined ISIS, the ginger jihad was employed as a butcher in a shop in Bankstown, The Daily Telegraph. 'He made his own bed now he has to lie in it,' his former boss said. 'He was a good kid. The best kid.' Elmir's boss was furious when the 17-year-old called in sick, the same day Elmir reportedly told his mother that he was 'going fishing' and disappeared from his Bankstown home in Sydney's south-west, in June. Elmir and his friend Feiz are believed to have made their way to Syria and Iraq after crossing the border from Turkey, where they were last known to have contacted family members. They travelled via Perth, with stops in Malaysia and Thailand. Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the 1.43 minutes long video is full of threats against the west . As Elmir finishes his diatribe the men all cheer and chant in Arabic . Elmir begins the video by saying 'this message I deliver to you the people of America, this message I deliver to you the people of Britain and this message I deliver especially to you the people of Australia'. Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the video which is 1.43 minutes long is full of heavily worded threats and taunts the US-led coalition that recently began air strikes on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq. 'I say this about your coalition: you threaten us with your countries, bring every nation that you wish to us, bring every nation that you want to come and fight us. Whether it's 50 nations or 50 thousand nations it means nothing to us,' Elmir says. Reading from a script, a black and white scarf wrapped around his head and a huge rifle in his hand, he warns: 'Bring your planes bring everything you want to use because it will not harm us because we have Allah which is something you do not have.' Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf is wanted by the Federal Police for his activities in Syria . Former Sydney boxer Mohamed Elomar posted photos of himself holding up decapitated heads on Twitter . A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: 'This video again highlights the threat posed by ISIL.' 'As the Prime Minister has said on many occasions, ISIL is a threat that reaches out to Australia and our allies and partners.' Elmir's family told the Sydney Morning Herald in June they were devastated their son had been 'brainwashed'. His family's lawyer Zali Burrows told the Australian Associated Press: 'The family went to the media today as a plea to the government to bring their boy back. 'We know they have the intelligence to pinpoint him. 'The concern is that he's being used as a tracking device to gather further intelligence, to see where he's actually going to go.' Ms Burrows questioned how Elmir was not stopped by Federal Police, who were thought to be monitoring him. On Sunday, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced Australia will send its special forces into Iraq to fight against Islamic State. Elmir's video was published one day after the announcement.","Rohan Gunaratna said authorities should act now on the likelihood of further planned attacks on Australian .

"Downton Abbey's beloved Carson has swapped his butler's uniform for a Father Christmas costume in a bid to raise awareness of global warming. Actor Jim Carter donned a fluffy beard and red robes to appear in a special Greenpeace film titled An Urgent Message From Santa. The 65-year-old urges viewers that Christmas could be cancelled unless world leaders take more action to protect the melting Arctic. Scroll down for video . Downton Abbey star Jim Carter appears in the special Greenpeace advert as a dishevelled Father Christmas to raise awareness of the melting Arctic . The actor who is married to fellow actress Imelda Staunton said: 'My wife and I have been Greenpeace members and supporters for the past 25 years and I couldn't say no when they asked me.' 'This is a chance to do something positive for the Arctic, which is a . precious resource. I hope that people will be prompted by this graphic . little film, get behind it, sign the petition and get more involved.' Carter who has also appeared in films such as Alice in Wonderland and Shakespeare in Love added: 'This is a very different version of Santa from the traditional, jolly, red-faced chap - this is a Santa on his last legs. 'I've never been a Father Christmas before, with the wig and the beard, because my voice would give me away. The 65-year-old actor warned viewers that Christmas could be cancelled unless world leaders did more to protect Santa's home in the Arctic . 'I want to do my part to help raise the profile of the threats posed to the Arctic by oil drilling and climate change. 'So I was pleased to have this opportunity to support Greenpeace and their amazing Christmas campaign.'

"Scientists at Columbia University found children exposed to high levels of air pollution during pregnancy are five times more likely to have ADHD . Children exposed to high levels of pollution in the womb are at greater risk of suffering attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a new study has found. Scientists at Columbia University studied 233 non-smoking pregnant women living in New York. They found children exposed to high levels of air pollution during pregnancy were five times more likely to have ADHD by the time they were nine years old. The nine-year study looked at levels of common pollutants polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Researchers measured the levels of PAH in maternal and umbilical cord blood shortly after delivery. And they repeated tests when each of the children were three and five, measuring levels of PAH in their urine. Thirty-three children who had high levels of exposure to PAHs, as measured at birth. Of those, 13 were diagnosed with ADHD hyperactive-impulsive subtype, seven the inattentive subtype, and 13 had both. Professor Frederica Perera, first author of the study, said: 'Those children born to moms who were exposed to high levels of PAH during pregnancy had five times the odds of having an increased number of symptoms.' PAHs are created when products like coal, oil, gas and rubbish are burned but not completely. They don't burn easily, and as a result remain in the environment for long periods of time. Most are used to conduct research though some are used to make dyes, plastics and pesticides. One of the most common ways they enter the body is through breathing in contaminated air. To establish children's exposure to PAHs in the womb, the scientists measured levels of fragments of the mothers' DNA bonded to PAH molecules, also known as DNA adducts, in umbilical cord blood. Previous studies carried out by Professor Perera and her team identified links between higher levels of prenatal PAH exposure and developmental delays in children by the age of three. They also noted lower IQ scores at five, and increased risk a child will suffer anxiety, depression and attention problems at six and seven. The new study, published in the journal PLoS One, looked at the children's ADHD symptoms using the Child Behavior Checklist and the Conners' Parent Rating Scale - two screening tests used to diagnose the condition. They studied 233 non-smoking pregnant women living in New York, measuring levels of a common pollutant in umbilical cord blood and then levels in the children's urine at ages three and five . Professor Perera said this is the first time a link has been established between prenatal PAH exposure and ADHD symptoms. She told LiveScience: 'If replicated, then these findings could lead to new ways or stronger ways, better ways, to prevent ADHD. 'By nature, environmental exposures are preventable, this we consider one possible contributor to ADHD and one that's preventable, and the findings should be followed up so that necessary preventive strategies could be taken.' She said pregnant women concerned about the effect of pollution levels on their unborn babies, can eat plenty of fresh produce which helps offset the effects of pollutants.","Scientists at Columbia University found children exposed to high levels of pollution were five times more likely to have ADHD by the age of nine .

"Vitamin E and other common supplements fuel lung cancer in smokers, researchers fear. They say that rather than preventing tumours, popular antioxidant pills may speed their growth and spread and hasten death. The experiments were done on mice, but the Swedish researchers believe they are relevant to people. Researchers warn that Vitamin E and other common supplements (pictured) could fuel lung cancer in smokers. They say that rather than preventing tumours, popular antioxidant pills may speed their growth and spread and hasten death . Vitamin E helps maintain cell structure by protecting cell membranes. Antioxidants, such as vitamins A, C and E, are credited with protecting against a host of ills, including cancer. But this study finds Vitamin E and other supplements fuel lung cancer in smokers. Vitamin E and other antioxidants are credited with boosting health by mopping up harmful molecules called free radicals. But it is thought that if cancer has already started to develop, they may actually feed the disease by switching off the body’s natural defences. The scientists recommended vitamin and other antioxidants are ‘used with caution’ by smokers and lung cancer patients. Cancer Research UK recently said that we should be able to get all the vitamins we need from a healthy diet, without resorting to supplements. Antioxidants, such as vitamins A, C and E, are credited with protecting against a host of ills, including cancer. However, recent studies have hinted that in some cases they may actually fuel the disease. When the University of Gothenburg researchers give vitamin E to mice in the very early stages of lung cancer, the disease grew and spread more quickly and the animals died twice as fast. Experiments on human cells confirmed the finding. A second antioxidant, a drug used to treat smoking-related lung conditions, had a similar effect. Vitamin E and other antioxidants are credited with boosting health by mopping up harmful molecules called free radicals, which are unstable and highly reactive so that in animal tissues they can damage cells. Anyone can have small lung tumours that are yet to be spotted by doctors, but they are most common in smokers. A coloured X-ray of the chest of a 52-year-old female patient with secondary lung cancer is pictured . But it is thought that if cancer has already started to develop, antioxidants may actually feed the disease by switching off the body’s natural defences. Although anyone can have small lung tumours that are yet to be spotted by doctors, they are most common in smokers. The researchers said the amounts of vitamin E used were similar to those found in supplements. They advised that the vitamin and other antioxidants are ‘used with caution’ by smokers, lung cancer patients and people with bronchitis, emphysema and other smoking-related lung conditions known collectively as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They said it is too early to give any advice to healthy people – or to say if vitamins speed the spread of other cancers. Vitamin E and other antioxidants are credited with boosting health by mopping up harmful molecules called free radicals (illustrated) The warning, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, is unlikely to apply to vitamin-rich ‘superfoods’ such as blueberries as they would have to be eaten in huge amounts to provide the levels of antioxidants contained in supplements. Dr Emma Smith, of Cancer Research UK’s senior science communications officer, cautioned that the study was done on mice and it is not clear what it means for people. However, she added: ‘There’s no strong evidence that antioxidants or vitamin supplements could reduce cancer risk, and some types of supplement can actually raise the risk. ‘There have also been concerns raised that antioxidants may interfere with cancer treatments. ‘We recommend that people stick to a healthy, balanced diet, which should provide all the nutrients you need without taking supplements.’","Swedish researchers made their findings in mice but believe the results are relevant to humans .

"Detectives working to find missing Madeleine McCann have given their counterparts in Portugal a new list of potential suspects and have urged them to investigate them . More than 20 new  suspects in the Madeleine McCann investigation have been identified  by British police. A Scotland Yard review of the bungled Portuguese inquiry into the three-year-old’s  disappearance in 2007 has uncovered dozens of fresh leads, it emerged yesterday. They include ‘forensic opportunities’ and several ‘people of interest’, including Britons, who have not been eliminated from the case. Madeleine’s parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, are said to be ‘greatly encouraged’ by the developments. But the Mail has learned that behind the scenes, a major diplomatic row is brewing because the Portuguese authorities are adamant they will not reopen the inquiry. Officials in Lisbon have told their British counterparts that under Portuguese laws, they can reopen the case only if there is new evidence. But Yard chiefs – who want the Portuguese to agree to a joint investigation – say their new leads could, if properly explored, result in new evidence and possibly the Maddie mystery being solved. One well-placed source described the deadlock as ‘a Mexican stand-off’. ‘It’s a chicken-and-egg situation. Significant new evidence can be found if the leads uncovered by the Yard are investigated. There are two major obstacles to a joint investigation: the money to fund it in Portugal and the loss of face they would suffer from having to agree to such an inquiry.’ It is understood high-level discussions have taken place in the UK about the possibility of Scotland Yard launching its own investigation. British police do not have jurisdiction in Portugal, but they have the right to investigate and prosecute any British suspects linked to Madeleine’s disappearance. Still hopeful: Mrs McCann returned to Portugal this month with her mother, Susan Healy, six years on . This picture shows Kate and Gerry McCann marking the fifth anniversary of their daughter's disappearance with an 'aged' photo of how she might look - on the sixth anniversary this year they said they'd not given up . Should the Met decide to launch its own investigation, it is likely to send a formal letter of request to the Portuguese authorities – seeking its assistance in its inquiries. Last night a Yard spokesman confirmed a high-level delegation of officers travelled to Portugal in March, but he refused to comment on what discussions took place. The senior detective who has overseen the Met’s two-year review of the case yesterday confirmed his officers had drawn up a list of people who they say are ‘of interest’. Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell, the head of Scotland Yard’s Homicide and Serious Crime Command, said there were a ‘good number’ of individuals who should be questioned. He would not disclose the precise number but sources told the Mail that at least 20 potential suspects – including a number of Britons who were in the Algarve at the time of Madeleine’s disappearance six years ago – had not been properly eliminated. Mr Campbell urged the Portuguese authorities to investigate the new leads. He said: ‘There are a lot of people of interest. There are people who could be properly explored further, if only to be eliminated.’ Madeleine went missing from her family’s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in Portugal in 2007 as her parents dined with friends nearby. The shambolic Portuguese inquiry was shelved in 2008 but Scotland Yard launched a Home Office-funded review of the case in 2011 following the intervention of David Cameron. Last year the officer in day-to-day charge of the review, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, said his team had identified 195 potential leads after examining a huge bundle of material. Mr Campbell said it was ‘perfectly probable’ that information which could identify the suspect responsible for Madeleine’s disappearance was already in the Portuguese files. He reiterated a claim that Madeleine could still be alive. He said: ‘You only have to look at the case in Cleveland, Ohio, and the European cases. Of course there is a possibility she is alive. ‘But the key is to investigate the case and, alive or dead, we should be able to try and discern what happened.’ The McCanns, of Rothley, Leicestershire, have been kept closely informed of Scotland Yard’s review – codenamed Operation Grange – over the past two years. A spokesman for the couple said: ‘They have been encouraged from the moment the review started and are now greatly encouraged that police have drawn up a short list of people who they believe are of interest to the inquiry.’ A source close to the couple said: ‘While they don’t want to raise their hopes too much, they are buoyed up by these revelations.’ A Home Office source said: ‘Clearly not all the 20 potential suspects identified by the Met could be responsible for Madeleine’s disappearance. But the Yard are adamant that if they were running the inquiry here, these people would have been properly eliminated.’ The Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz in the Algarve from where Madeleine McCann was abducted in May 2007 .

"A trainee nurse was left dripping with blood after she disturbed an intruder at her home - who slashed her across the face. Gemma Ball, 20, needed internal stitches to the flesh in her face after a hooded man pulled a blade on her when she caught him in the back garden of her home in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs. The student was terrified when the hooded intruder kicked her dog, sending it flying into a wall - before slashing her across the face, less than an inch from her eye socket, in broad daylight. Horrific: Gemma Ball had to have internal stitches after the an intruder at her home slashed her face with a knife after kicking her dog, Bella . Sewn up: The gash was so deep that doctors were forced to re-open the wound after stitching it up to repair damage to the flesh underneath . The police have now released an image of a suspect they want to speak to in connection with the incident, which happened on September 24. Gemma, who also works as a carer, said: 'My mum and dad had gone out to work early, and I was still in bed when I was woken up by the dogs barking. 'My cocker spaniels, Rosie and Bella, were going mad, so I let them outside, and they ran straight to the bottom of the garden. 'I followed them and I saw this man standing there - I froze in complete shock, and screamed at him to get out. Traumatised: Ms Ball and Bella were both shaken up by the incident and the trainee nurse is now scared to be home alone . 'Bella ran up to him, barking, because she knew he shouldn’t be there and could probably sense I was frightened. 'But he just gave her an almighty kick and she flew into the wall with a huge thud. 'I ran over to her and I saw him pull a flick knife out of his pocket. 'I thought he was coming to stab Bella, so I grabbed her, and next thing I knew she was covered in blood. 'I felt a sharp pain in my head, but I didn’t realise what had happened. 'He jumped over the fence and I heard him shout ""Run!"", and I ran inside with my dog. Distressed: Ms Ball looks in shock in the . picture taken immediately after the attack, left, as Bella recovers from . the shock of being kicked during the incident . 'It was only when I ran past a mirror that I realised all the blood was coming from me, and there was a huge slash on my head.' Police took Gemma to University Hospital of North Staffordshire, where she was given stitches to close the wound - but doctors realised some days later that her injury was not healing properly. They were forced to cut open the wound again and stitch the flesh underneath to aid the healing process, before sewing the slashed layer of skin above back together. She added: 'I am so scared to be at home by myself now - and poor Bella is really nervous. 'She wasn’t a very well dog to start with, and I’m lucky this didn’t kill her.' Police are hunting the suspect, who was wearing a hat and coat fully zipped up, just revealing his eyes. He is believed to be in his 30s, and of tall, slim build. Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Becky Evans at Staffordshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 99 of September 24. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.

"Alzheimer’s will be treated or even prevented by replacing faulty genes, an expert in the disease has predicted. Men and women could be given a nasal spray packed with healthy versions of the defective genes that cause the illness. Professor Julie Williams, of Cardiff University, said the entire population could eventually be screened in middle-age to identify those at most risk of the memory-robbing disease. They could then be given cutting-edge gene therapy and other treatments to stop the disease ever developing. Gene therapy: Men and women could be given a nasal spray packed with healthy versions of the defective genes that cause Alzheimer's . Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 Britons, with the number expected to double in a generation as the population ages. Existing drugs delay the progress of Alzheimer’s, but their failure to tackle the underlying cause in the brain means that the effect quickly wears off and the disease soon takes its devastating course. The professor, who was given a CBE in the Queen’s birthday honours last year for her work on Alzheimer’s, made the prediction after jointly leading the biggest-ever study into the genetics of the disease. The landmark study, involving more than 180 researchers from 15 countries, pinpointed 11 genes that raise the risk of Alzheimer’s. The size of the collaboration allowed them to identify more genes in less than three years than have been found in the past two decades. By taking the total to 21, it also more than doubles the number of known Alzheimer’s genes, the journal Nature Genetics reports. Alzheimer’s charities said the ‘exciting’ discovery of genes linked with the disease ‘opens up new avenues to explore in the search for treatments for the condition’. Screening: Professor Julie Williams says the entire population could eventually be screened in middle-age to identify those at most risk of the disease . The new genes were found by comparing the DNA of more than 25,000 people suffering from Alzheimer’s with that of 48,000 people without the disease. Professor Williams, who is chief scientific adviser to the Welsh Assembly in addition to being a working researcher, said: ‘What surprised us most about the findings was the very strong pattern that showed several genes implicating the body’s immune system in causing dementia. ‘Each individual gene will carry a relatively low risk but when you put all the information together, they are telling us an interesting and novel story and that takes us in a new direction.’ She added that the find needs to be followed up with ‘great urgency’ to determine just how the genes cause dementia. Knowing this will speed the search for new drug treatments. Medicine: Existing drugs delay the progress of Alzheimer's, but fail to tackle the underlying cause in the brain . But another possibility is correcting the flawed DNA, or the genetic variations that cause Alzheimer’s, by giving people a nasal spray packed with healthy genes. Professor Williams said: ‘I do think that in ten years’ time we might be looking at a genetic therapy. That might be feasible but not quite yet. ‘If you have variation that you know is contributing to a disease, the most effective way of reducing the risk is to change the variation in a very precise way. Genetic therapies will allow you to just change the elements that are contributing to the disease. ‘Drugs may not be precise and can cause side-effects.’ She added that ‘in the distant future’ everyone in their 40s or 50s could be screened for dementia genes and given genetic therapy and other treatments in a bid to stop the disease ever developing. The study also suggested links between Alzheimer’s and multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease. Professor Hugh Perry of the Medical Research Council, which part-funded the study, as did Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘Understanding how our genetic code contributes to Alzheimer’s disease, other dementias and neurodegenerative diseases is a crucial part of the puzzle in learning how we can prevent their devastating effects.’","People could be given cutting-edge nasal spray packed with healthy genes .

"Thank you to everyone: Now that Alex Hunter has raised the money he needs he can get the dentures that will allow him to smile again . Alex Hunter, the California teen who needed to raise $11,000 for dentures after he lost his teeth beating two different types of cancer has said a huge 'Thank you' to the public after they donated the money in less than one day. According to his mother, Lisbeth, the brave 16-year-old has been 'blown away' by the reaction from around the world as cash poured in from those touched by his story after reading it on Tuesday on MailOnline. Declined treatment by his insurance company, Alex took to his gofundme page to express his heartfelt gratitude, 'from friends, to family, to my community and everyone else that has been beyond generous to help me in meeting and surpassing my goal. Thank you!' Mom, . Lisbeth, told MailOnline that if everything goes according to plan Alex . could be fitted with his new teeth in two weeks, just in time for the . start of the new school year. Lisbeth . said that the first thing Alex will do when he gets his new dentures . 'will be to celebrate with a smile and also a good meal', now that he . will be able to eat anything he wants. In . less than 48 hours, Alex has seen donations of more than $17,000 flood . in to his gofundme page to help him and his initial goal of $11,000 was reached in less than . 20 hours. An . ecstatic Lisbeth told MailOnline that when Alex was told he would be . getting his dentures much sooner than he may have thought, he beamed 'a . toothless smile'. 'It's a bit overwhelming,' said Lisbeth. 'It's amazing. Never in our wildest dreams did we think that this would happen. Fighter: Alex Hunter, 16, has had all of his teeth removed after battling cancer twice -and his insurance company declined to cover his dentures because it is not a medical issue . 'We appreciated any help and never expected anything like this. 'There is always the cliche that words are not enough, but in this case that is true. 'Thank you for your generosity, thank you.' One anonymous donor pledged $5,000 and Lisbeth said that she was extremely touched by the gesture. 'I am praying God blesses you as much as you have blessed Alex,' said Lisbeth to MailOnline. At the very lastest Alex will have his dentures fitted two weeks into the new school year and Lisbeth said that the remaining money left over will remain in an account to help Alex with any more medical expenses he will need. Alex, from Delano, California, made the tough decision to get his 19 remaining teeth removed two weeks ago after years of radiation left them fragile and impossible to use. Goal reached: Alex Hunter's gofundme page has managed to raise in excess of the $11,000 he needs to have dentures fitted after his insurance company declined to pay for them . While his insurance - which is provided by the state because of his mother's job working for Bakersfield - covered part of the procedure to remove the teeth, it would not cover the dentures, his family said - prompting their internet fund raising. 'They say it's not a medical issue but they know they took out the teeth because of a medical issue,' his grandmother, Roberta Hunter, told MailOnline earlier on Tuesday about the insurance company's stance. 'It feels like the insurance is just bailing out on him.' Now the teenager, who loves to sing and one day hopes to be a counselor, will be able to go ahead and get his dentures fitted. On the mend: Alex was first diganosed with cancer when he was four and overcame it, before being diagnosed again when he was 13. His family is now hopeful that he is cancer-free for the second time . Alex's family, who have never asked for anything throughout Alex's 11 years of treatments launched their gofundme page, Alex Hunter's Medical Fund, on Monday in the hope of raising the money. By Tuesday afternoon, when the MailOnline first published Alex's story, the fund stood at $1,000, but in a little less than six hours had smashed through its target. Inspiration: Despite his health struggles, Alex is a top student who dreams of becoming a counselor . 'He doesn't smile because his teeth were never attractive,' his grandmother said earlier about the brave teen. 'He was anxious to get them out and get it over with but now we're waiting to see what's next.' Alex was just four when he was first diagnosed with a rare type of cancer, Embryonal Parameningeal Rhabdomyosarcoma, after a mass started growing in his cheek. He underwent aggressive chemotherapy and stayed in hospital for months as he battled the side effects of the radiation. He lost vision in his left eye and feeling on the left side of his face. He was also left with a thin frame, teeth problems and thyroid gland issues, but in July 2003, doctors said he was cancer-free. Then in November 2011, when he was 13, he was back to hospital to undergo surgery on an enlarged thyroid gland - and doctors learned he had Hurthle Cell Carcinoma, a rare thyroid cancer. On the gofundme page, his family explained that the cancer is believed to be an effect of treatment from his first battle with cancer. But now, nearly three years on from his second diagnosis, and his family say he is free from cancer again. One final scan in October will confirm that he is again cancer-free. Hopeful: His mother Liz, pictured right, launched a gofundme help and is appealing to foundations for funds . In the meantime, Alex is impressing his family with his commitment as a student and a friend. Relatives told KERO that he once put together a yearbook for a friend, including photos and signatures from staff and students, after the teen could not afford to buy one from the school. Alex is also taking advanced placement classes and has been singing with the choir for two years. He is already thinking about college, where he wants to major in psychology and sociology. 'He's just so positive,' his grandmother said. 'He sings, he's really active in school - but kids do stare at him. I can't wait for him to get his teeth but right now all we can do is take it one day at a time.'

"Offensive: ITV reporter Richard Pallot twice referred to black footballers as 'coloured' ITV were forced to apologise today after a reporter covering a Downing Street football racism summit twice referred to black players as 'coloured'. Richard Pallot was talking about the lack of black managers in the game when he made the mistake. ITV admitted that the report - recorded in advance of the 1.30pm news - should have been more carefully checked before it was broadcast. The journalist was covering the summit held by David Cameron on racism in football with leading black footballers including John Barnes and Jason Roberts. Mr Cameron said in Parliament today that there are 'worrying' signs that racism is creeping back into football. Following the ITV broadcast, dozens of viewers objected to the  uses of the term 'coloured' on Twitter. In modern times, it has come to be considered offensive because it classes everyone . who is not white as being the same. The incident happened after Alan Hansen was forced to apologise for using the same word on Match of the Day. The pundit, who reportedly earns £40,000 a show, said 'coloured' twice during the BBC1 programme as he talked about racism in the game in December. After Mr Pallot used the same term, one Twitter user wrote to ITV: 'When was it okay to use the word coloured? And to make it worse is that you were talking about racism!' Discrimination claims: David Cameron and John Barnes, right, hold a roundtable discussion at a Downing Street racism summit . Discussions: The group, including Sir Trevor Brooking, FA chairman David Bernstein and PFA chief Gordon Taylor listen as Mr Cameron spoke during the Downing Street summit . Others who attended the summit included former executive deputy chairman of Millwall FC Heather Rabbatts, left, general secretary of the Premier League Nic Coward, and Reading FC footballer Jason Roberts . Another person said: 'Why do the itv news keep saying ""coloured"" when they mean black. It's a bit uncomfortable to listen to..' An ITV spokeswoman said they were sorry and the recording should never have gone out. 'ITV . News apologises for the inappropriate use of the word ""coloured"" in a . report on racism and football in today’s News at 1.30,' she said. 'We take this error very seriously and we regret any offence caused.' Race summit: Charlton Athletic manager Chris Powell, a former England manager, and Reading FC striker Jason Roberts, right, arrive in Downing Street today . The ITV news programme is produced by ITN. Using the term 'coloured' to refer to black people is considered offensive because it dismisses everyone who is not white as the same. The term was in widespread use in Britain in the 1960s but is now considered racist. The problem is it suggests white people are white and everyone else is 'coloured'. There is no recognition that everyone has their own ethnic origin. Alan Hansen sparked a row by using the term last year on the day that John Terry was charged with racially abusing Anton Ferdinand. He denies the offence. She added that they had not uploaded the footage onto their website - and it had not been broadcast on ITV+1 an hour later. The . mistake happened as black footballers Jason Roberts and John Barnes . attended a racism summit with the Prime Minister in Downing Street . today. Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was recently banned for racially abusing Manchester defender Patrice Evra. When the two sides met again recently . the Uruguayan became embroiled in a further row when he refused to shake . the Frenchman's hand. Mr Cameron warned that footballers . were role models to young people, who copied what they saw at games when . they learnt to play the game themselves. Speaking during Prime Minister’s . Questions in the Commons, Mr Cameron said: 'It was a huge achievement . where Britain and its football authorities and football clubs actually . led the world in kicking racism out of football, something that hasn’t . happened in all other countries. 'It is worrying some of the recent signs we have seen. English World Cup referee Howard Webb and Birmingham manager Chris Hughton arrive at the racism summit today . 'Why I think this matters, not just to . football, but also to Government and everyone in our country, is . because football and footballers are role models to young people. 'What people see on the football pitch, they copy when they go to learn to play football themselves. 'I think it is important to bring people together and make sure we kick racism out of football for good.' Former Liverpool FC footballer Tommy Smith said there is more racism among footballers today than in the past, and suggested that the culprits should be jailed. The former defender was attending an auction of his medals and shirts in Chester today. Asked to compare racism in football today to when he was a player, he said: 'I think there is more now, because at (that) time England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales (were) part of the English league, now it is Continental players coming from Spain and Portugal. 'I think there was far less (racism) in the 60s and 70s than there is now. 'I don’t know how to stop it, unless you get one of the players and tell them you are going to put them in jail because he is messing about, and maybe that will work.'","Richard Pallot TWICE called black players 'coloured'

"Risk? The study results suggest a link between supplements and cancer . Men who take high doses of vitamin supplements could be increasing their risk of lethal prostate cancer by nearly 30 per cent, say researchers. A study of 48,000 men spanning more than two decades suggests popping too many vitamin pills can put them in danger of tumours that are more likely to be fatal. The researchers linked high doses of vitamin C to an increased risk of lethal and advanced prostate cancer. The results, by experts from Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, in the US, and the University of Oslo in Norway, are not the first to raise the alarm over the dangers of excess vitamin consumption. Nearly a quarter of adults in the UK are estimated to take antioxidant supplements or multivitamins regularly in the hope that it will help protect them against illnesses such as heart disease and cancer. The market for such products is worth around half a billion pounds a year. In recent years, high-dose vitamins have become popular, with people  taking more in the belief that it is  better for them. For example, health food shops now sell vitamin C tablets in doses of 1,000mg each, but the body needs only about 40mg a day to keep cells healthy and promote healing. In the latest research, the scientists set out to see if antioxidants in vitamin pills and food could reduce the chances of a prostate tumour. From 1986 to 2008 they followed 48,000 men aged between 40 and 75. Every four years, the men completed food questionnaires designed to record their dietary habits. The researchers followed them up to see which ones developed prostate cancer. The results, published in the International Journal Of Cancer, show that total antioxidant intake – from foods or pills – neither increased nor decreased the risk of a tumour. Antioxidants fight the process, called oxidation, that destroys cells. There was some suggestion antioxidants from coffee had a slightly protective effect. But the most alarming finding was that men with the highest intake of antioxidants from vitamin pills were 28 per cent more likely to get lethal prostate cancer than those who took the lowest amount of pills or none. Those with the highest intake of antioxidants from vitamin pills were 15 per cent more likely to get advanced prostate cancer – a tumour that spreads quickly beyond the prostate, reducing the chances of survival. Deadly: Prostate cancer, pictured here under a microscope, kills thousands every year . In a report the researchers said: ‘High intake of antioxidants from  supplements was associated with increased risk for lethal and advanced prostate cancer. 'The main contributor is vitamin C, and this finding warrants further investigation.’ But the researchers stressed that, until more research is carried out, they cannot be sure that vitamin tablets actually cause cancer. It may be that the cancer victims felt unwell for several months before their diagnosis and simply increased vitamin intake to try to ward off symptoms such as fatigue. Dr Carrie Ruxton, of the Health Supplements Information Service, which is funded by supplements makers, said: ‘It is entirely possible that these men may have had prostate-related symptoms and fatigue long before diagnosis. 'The cancer may have had nothing to do with the supplements.’","Study of followed the health of 48,000 men aged 40-75 over 22 years .

"It might be the one of the few occasions in life when it's better to be unpopular than have lots of friends. Twitter users who make 'grossly offensive' comments online could escape prosecution if they have barely any followers on the social media site, the Director of Public Prosecutions has suggested. But those who are followed by thousands could face the full force of the law if they publish offensive remarks as more people will see them, Keir Starmer said in a conference speech earlier this week. Big issue: The remarks by Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer (left) follow a row about free speech after Linford House (right) was arrested in Kent for allegedly posting a photo of a burning poppy on Facebook . His remarks follow a row about free speech after a teenager in Kent was arrested earlier this week for allegedly posting a photo of a burning poppy on Facebook, reported the Daily Telegraph. The arrest of Linford House, 19, prompted civil liberty groups to campaign for free speech, claiming police were threatening the man's rights to express himself - even if what he posted was insensitive. Mr Starmer's comments come before he publishes guidelines to cope with the new issues arising from expression on social networks, after meeting with police, publishers and internet companies. Daniel Thomas, a footballer from Port Talbot, Wales, was arrested in the summer after a homophobic message was posted from his Twitter account about Team GB Olympic diver Tom Daley. Going online: Twitter users who make 'grossly offensive' comments online could escape prosecution if they have barely any followers on the social media site, the Director of Public Prosecutions has suggested . But the 28-year-old was never prosecuted, in part because he only had only around a hundred followers - and while the content was offensive it was not seen as a criminal offence, the DPP said. Twitter users who libel individuals on the web face the same laws as newspaper editors, the Justice Secretary Chris Grayling insisted today. He warned internet users who defame public figures that they could find themselves in court. Mr Grayling said: ‘It is utterly, utterly wrong that anybody should have their name blackened, inappropriately and falsely, on any form of social media.’ He was speaking amid the outcry over a BBC Newsnight report which led to Tory peer Lord McAlpine being wrongly branded a paedophile. ‘I am as concerned as anybody else about what has taken place over the last two weeks,’ he said. ‘The laws of libel apply equally to what you publish on your Facebook page or Twitter page as they do in a printed form. ‘Those who are damaged in that way have full legal redress to try and get proper justice.’ Mr Starmer, who was speaking at the Internet Service Providers’ Association conference in London on Monday, appeared in the wake of various incidents involving social networks. Matthew Woods, 19, from Chorley, Lancashire, who made explicit comments and jokes about missing children April Jones and Madeleine McCann, was jailed for 12 weeks last month. ‘If you send a message to the family of April Jones one hour after they have been told their little girl is dead, that is very different to you sending an email to your mate,’ Mr Starmer said, reported the Daily Telegraph. Azhar Ahmed, 20, of Ravensthorpe, West Yorkshire, was given a community order in September after saying ‘all soldiers should die and go to hell’ on Facebook following the deaths of six British soldiers. These cases have involved Section 127 of the Communications Act, which bans ‘grossly offensive’ messages being sent over telecommunications networks - which has been in place since the 1930s. ‘Millions of cases could potentially be put through our system,’ Mr Starmer said, reported the Daily Telegraph. ‘More cases than the combined number of every other offence on the statute book.’ 'The CPS will produce guidelines on cases . involving social media which will include a wide range of factors that . may make prosecution more or less likely. There will be no one factor . which will determine the outcome of any case' Crown Prosecution Service spokesman . A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘As the Director of Public Prosecutions has said previously about offences committed on social media, “context and circumstances are highly relevant”. ‘In accordance with this, the CPS will produce guidelines on cases involving social media which will include a wide range of factors that may make prosecution more or less likely. There will be no one factor which will determine the outcome of any case. ’By way of example, as you can see from the DPP’s statement in relation to the case about Tom Daley, the context and circumstances which are considered might include factors such as the intention of the suspect and the impact on the victim.’ Prosecution: A 19-year-old man from Chorley, Lancashire, who made explicit comments and jokes about missing children April Jones (left) and Madeleine McCann (right), was jailed for 12 weeks last month . As the UK debates how to adapt . guidelines to the explosion of social media but still respect the right . of free speech, Australia has abandoned a proposed filter to block . offensive sites. The Australian government has ditched its five-year pledge to introduce a compulsory filter blocking child pornography and other objectionable internet content. Instead, internet service providers have agreed to block 1,400 child abuse websites on Interpol's 'worst of' list, the country’s communications minister Stephen Conroy said. Three of Australia's largest telecommunications companies - Telstra, Optus and Primus - have been blocking the listed sites anyway since 2010. Critics had argued the compulsory filter would have put Australia in the same censorship league as China. The US had been among those who expressed concerns at the proposed regulations.","Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer will issue new guidelines .

"Thousands of years before the advent of CDs, ancient people were using disks to store information. Now, one expert has described the Phaistos Disk – a mysterious circular clay tablet with a spiral inscription – as the ‘first Minoan CD-ROM', because of the way the pictorial markings are laid out. He claims the disk features a prayer to mother, which is recorded using an ancient language made up of signs, including what looks like a plumed head, a child and even a beehive. Scroll down for video . One expert has described the Phaistos Disk – a mysterious circular clay tablet with a spiral inscription (pictured) – as the ‘first Minoan CD-ROM', because of the way the pictorial markings are laid out . The disk is thought to date to the middle Minoan Bronze Age, in the second Millennium BC, and was discovered in 1908 at the palace of Phaistos, in  Crete. It measures 6 inches (15cm) in diameter and is covered on both sides in a spiral of stamped signs. Since it was found, experts have been trying to decipher the mysterious inscriptions and have come up with a number of interpretations. It is very hard to come up with a definitive reading of the disk, because it is made up of just 241 pictures, or 'tokens' on both its sides based on 45 individual signs. Most experts believe that the inscription should be read from the outside edge of the disk, inwards. Dr Gareth Owens claims the disk features a prayer to mother, which is recorded using an obscure ancient language made up of signs, including what looks like a plumed head, a child and even a beehive. He worked this out by picking out a reoccurring keyword (pictured) which he used as a basis for his translation . The Phaistos Disk is a disk made of fired clay that was found in the Minoan palace of Phaistos on Crete. It is thought to date to the middle Minoan Bronze Age in the second millennium BC, but precise estimates vary. The disk measures 6 inches (15cm) in diameter and is covered on both sides in a spiral of stamped signs. Its purpose and meaning is disputed, and now one expert claims it is an ancient prayer to a mother. The disk was discovered in 1908 and features 241 'tokens' made up of 45 unique signs laid out in a spiralling clockwise sequence. Many of these 45 signs represent easily identifiable every-day things. In addition to these, there is a small diagonal line that occurs underneath the final sign in a group a total of 18 times. The disc shows traces of corrections made by the scribe in several places. Dr Gareth Owens of the Technological Educational Institute (TEI) of Crete believes the disk is dedicated to a mother, Archaeology News Network reported. ‘The most stable word and value is “mother” and in particular the mother goddess of the Minoan era,’ he said in a public talk at the Institute. He looked at groupings of signs found on three of parts of one side of the disk to come up with this theory. They spell out I-QE-KU-RJA and he said that I-QE means ‘great lady of importance’. On the other side of the double-sided disk, he identified the word AKKA, which he says means ‘pregnant mother’. Therefore, he thinks that one side is dedicated to a pregnant woman and the other to a woman giving birth. Speaking in a TED talk in May, he explained how he worked with John Coleman at Oxford University for six years to crack the code. ‘It’s the closest thing to a partial Minoan Rosetta Stone,’ he said, stating that they can now read 90 per cent of ‘Side A’ of the disk. Their next challenge is to work out exactly what the signs means, but Dr Owens is sure it is a ‘genuine Minoan religious inscription’. He light-heartedly likened the ancient disk to a CD-ROM because it stores information. ‘It could stand for Clay Disk – Read Only Minos,’ he quipped. The disk is so important because it is from Minoan Crete – the first literate civilisation in Europe. The disk is thought to date to the middle Minoan Bronze Age, in the second Millennium BC and was discovered in 1900 at the palace of Phasitos (pictured), in the north eastern Crete .","Ancient clay disk found in Crete 'stores' a prayer to a mother .

"A blogger who called a local politician a 'c***' on Twitter sparked a row over freedom of speech after being convicted of sending the offensive remark. John Graham Kerlan who blogs under the name Olly Cromwell, faces jail after Councillor Melvyn Seymour complained.

Answers on a postcard to #bexleycouncil.' 'Offensive': John Graham Kerlen (left), aka Olly Cromwell, posted a four-letter attack against Bexley councillor Melvin Seymour (right) on Twitter . The 37-year-old went on to post . another message in which he appeared to encourage other Twitter users to . post excrement to the house he had identified. A later tweet read: 'It’s silly . posting a picture of a house on Twitter without an address, that will . come later. Please feel free to post actual s**t.' It is unclear whether Mr Kerlen went on to post the address of the councillor. Mr Kerlen was arrested after a . complaint from the councillor in question, and was charged with an . offence under Section 127 of the Telecommunications Act 2003.

And in a case which could have huge legal repercussions for Twitter and its millions of users, Kerlen was convicted of the offence by Greenwich magistrates and now faces a possible jail term. His legal battle has since been . supported in large numbers on Twitter, where the hashtag . #freethebexleyone became a trending topic. Political campaigner and blogger Mark Wallace wrote: 'Shockingly, a man has been convicted for swearing on twitter.' Another Twitter user called Nick wrote: 'This has far ranging implications for free speech.' Royston Westbrook also tweeted in support, saying: 'If someone wants to call someone else a c*** that is their choice, and their opinion.' Mr Kerlen, whose website was not . working today and claimed on his Twitter page that he had been 'censored . by the state' appeared before Bexley magistrates in January. He denied sending an offensive or obscene message by means of a public electronic communication network. But last week he was convicted of making a grossly offensive and menacing comment on Twitter, thought to be towards Mr Seymour. Taking action: Kerlen's Twitter page on which he claims he has been 'censored by the state'. The page was at the centre of his conviction . Trending: The hashtag #FreeTheBexleyOne became a hot topic on Twitter after Kerlen's conviction . He has been handed a restraining order that ordered him: . Mr Kerlen, from Millwards, Essex, has been granted conditional bail until his sentencing on May 9. He could receive a custodial sentence of up to six months in jail. A spokesman for Bexley Council said: 'The council is totally supportive of freedom of expression and political debate. 'The council is of the view that Kerlen's actions went beyond the limits of what is both acceptable and reasonable in terms of freedom of expression.'

"The BBC gives too much weight to pro-immigration voices and ‘almost totally ignores’ the negative social impact of multiculturalism, a new study has claimed. The corporation suffers from left wing ‘groupthink’ that prevents its journalists from challenging institutional bias and results in pro-immigration ‘propaganda’, according to the research published yesterday. It was also accused of ‘downplaying’ violence by Islamists while being happy to criticise Christianity and report on the activities of other violent extremists. The BBC has been accused of 'downplaying' violence by Islamists after a report which analysed its coverage since 1997 . The report, by independent think-tank The New Culture Forum, looked at coverage by BBC news and current affairs programmes since 1997. It comes as the BBC undertakes an ‘impartiality review’ by former ITV and Sky executive Stuart Prebble to see whether it gives ‘due weight’ to a full range of opinion on controversial topics, such as immigration. The study’s author, Ed West, concluded: ‘In its coverage of the topic of immigration, the BBC has given overwhelmingly greater weight to pro-migration voices, even though they represent a minority – even elitist – viewpoint. ‘And in its coverage of the economic arguments for and against immigration, it has devoted somewhat more space to pro-migration voices. ‘In terms of the social costs, the BBC has almost totally ignored certain areas. The more awkward a subject is for polite society to deal with, the less coverage the BBC gives it.’ He added: ‘It would be no exaggeration to say that a foreigner who subscribed only to the BBC might visit this country and be blissfully unaware of many of the social problems associated with immigration.’ According to the study, it is ‘common practice’ for the BBC to give a platform to multiple pro-immigration spokesmen with no dissenting voices. Mr West said: ‘Between 1997 and 2013, of the hundreds of immigration news reports that I have personally watched, listened to and read, in literally just a handful have anti-immigration voices not been outnumbered.’ The report was particularly scathing about a BBC Online article on ‘Migrant Myths’ published in 2002. The article said the idea of the ‘scrounging, bogus asylum seeker’ was a ‘misconception’, while opponents of mass immigration were guilty of ‘racism, political opportunism, misinformation, media mischief-making and sheer cowardice’ as well as genuine concern. Mr West said: ‘However laudable its intentions may be, a feature like this – which presents only one side of the argument – is propaganda.’ He said BBC bias was often unintentional or provoked by ‘basic decency’ and a desire to protect the underdog. In the wake of the Woolwich killing last week, the study accused the BBC of failing to report accurately on violence by Islamic fundamentalists . But he said by focussing on personalised, emotive cases of asylum seekers and immigration success stories, the BBC failed to cover the views of ‘working class natives’ or to ask awkward questions about the difficulties of integration. Damagingly, in the wake of the Woolwich killing last week, the study accused the BBC of failing to report accurately on violence by Islamic fundamentalists. It said: ‘In contrast to violence perpetrated by white-skinned extremists, the BBC tends to downplay any violent activity on the part of extremists.’ It added: ‘The BBC feels uncomfortable tackling Islamic extremism or aggression by minorities; it feels more at ease to see Muslims as victims of racism or Islamophobia.’ In 2010, the BBC’s then director general Mark Thompson accepted the corporation had once been guilty of a ‘massive’ Left-wing bias and admitted its coverage of immigration and Europe had been ‘weak’. He said: ‘The BBC doesn’t always get it right. I think there are some areas, immigration, business and Europe where the BBC has historically been rather weak and rather nervous about letting that entire debate happen. In 2007, a BBC Trust report into the BBC’s impartiality found the corporation had self-censored subjects it found unpalatable. The BBC said coverage of immigration is ‘impartial and balanced’, but Trustees are carrying out a review to see if ‘due weight’ is given to a range of opinions on hot topics.","Report looked at coverage by BBC news and current affairs programmes since 1997 .

The row over the allowance comes as the Labour-controlled authority is making more than £200m in cuts by 2018 and getting rid of 1,600 jobs. Expensive taste: Durham County Council chairwoman Linda Marshall who receives a clothing allowance of £8,580 from the cash-strapped authority . Current chairwoman Councillor Linda Marshall receives a £13,300 basic allowance paid to all councillors, a special responsibility allowance of £6,650 - and a clothing allowance of £8,580. The vice-chairwoman Councillor Pauline Charlton receives the basic allowance, a special responsibility allowance of £3,325 and a clothing allowance of £4,280. Kevin Rowan, regional secretary of the Trade Union Congress, said: 'Everybody knows the financial pressures that councils are under and trade unions have encouraged councillors to take decisions that prioritise protecting services and jobs. 'Councillors need to take the lead by making sure that there aren't any unjustifiable allowances or other perks that they receive. In all her finery: Chairwoman Linda Marshall pictured right last year during Queen Elizabeth's visit to Durham College . 'Durham County Council workers and tax payers will look at this and find it a bit unnecessary.' Councillor Mark Wilkes, a Liberal Democrat councillor representing Framwellgate Moor, County Durham, said: 'You can find a reasonably priced suit for a man or woman for about £100. 'So the £12,000 plus that is paid to councillors Marshall and Charlton would pay for the equivalent of 120 suits. We should scrap this waste. 'Labour are fleecing Durham residents and opposition councillors and we have had enough of them trying to pull the wool over our eyes.' Durham County Council has refused to axe the perk despite critics saying the money would be better spent on vital services . Deputy leader Alan Napier, the council's cabinet portfolio holder for resources, said the allowance had been in place for nearly 30 years. He said: 'The allowance covers all expenses associated with being the chairman and is not solely a clothing allowance.' He said the chairwoman had very important civic responsibilities and was bound to incur 'significant expenses'. According to Mr Napier, workload had increased significantly since the council became a unitary authority in 2009. However, . Nigel Martin, the council's Liberal Democrat leader, said money saved . by axing the clothing allowance could used to part-fund the county's . Citizens Advice Bureau which is having its funding contributions cut. He said: 'We don't believe there should be an enormous allowance like this for clothing.'£8,580, let alone £12,000, is more than a pensioner gets to live on during the course of a year.' Taxpayer John Marshall, who lives in Shildon, County Durham, said: 'I think this is a ludicrous amount for clothing and something should be done about it.' Councillor Marshall, who represents Chester-le-Street West for Labour, did not respond to calls to her County Hall office. The councillor, who lives in Craghead, near Stanley, was previously vice-chairwoman and took over the post in April last year. Her colleague, the current vice-chairwoman, Councillor Charlton said: 'I don't think it is my place to comment.' A spokesman for North Yorkshire County Council, which also has a chairman and vice-chair, said: 'We don't pay any additional sums beyond [the] special responsibility allowance.' Hartlepool and Middlesbrough councils also confirmed that while special responsibility allowances are paid to its chairmen, no additional allowances are paid. Meanwhile, Surrey County Council, which previously paid a clothing allowance to its chair and vice chair, scrapped the payments three years ago.","Durham County Council is having to make £200m in cuts by 2018 .

"It sounds like the Holy Grail for humankind; a technique that could slow down ageing by up to half. Now geneticists in Japan have found a way to achieve just that – albeit in a flower, and not a person. The breakthrough allows bouquets to remain fresh for much longer and could help unravel secrets on how to prevent cell decay in other organisms. Japanese scientists say they have found a way to slow down the ageing process in flowers by up to a half, meaning bouquets could remain fresh for much longer . Researchers at the National Agriculture and Food Research Organisation in Tsukuba, east of Tokyo, said they had found the gene believed to be responsible for the short shelf-life of flowers in one Japanese variety of morning glory. 'Morning glory' is the popular name for hundreds of species of flowering plants whose short-lived blooms usually unfold early in the day and are gone by nightfall. By suppressing the gene – named 'Ephmeral1' – the lifespan of each flower was almost doubled, said Kenichi Shibuya, one of the lead researchers in a study carried out jointly with Kagoshima University in southern Japan. Researchers at the National Agriculture and Food Research Organisation in Tsukuba, east of Tokyo, said they had found the gene believed to be responsible for the short shelf-life of flowers in one Japanese variety of morning glory (pictured) Scientists in Japan suppressed the gene 'Ephmeral1'  to double the lifespan of Morning Glory . Living to the ripe old age of 500 might be a possibility if the science shown to extend worms' lives can be applied to humans, scientists have said. In December, U.S. researchers tweaked two genetic pathways in the tiny lab worm Caenorhabditis elegans and boosted the creature's lifespan by a factor of five.The research raises the prospect of anti-ageing treatments based on genetic interactions, they said. ‘What we have here is a synergistic five-fold increase in lifespan,’ said lead scientist Dr Pankaj Kapahi, from the Buck Institute of Age Research, Novato, California. ‘The two mutations set off a positive feedback loop in specific tissues that amplified lifespan. ‘Basically these worms lived to the human equivalent of 400 to 500 years.’ 'Unmodified flowers started withering 13 hours after they opened, but flowers that had been genetically modified stayed open for 24 hours,' he said. This means the plant has fresh purple flowers alongside the paler blooms from the previous day, he said. 'We have concluded that the gene is linked to petal ageing,' Professor Shibuya told AFP. The finding could lead to developing methods to extend the life of cut flowers, he added. 'It would be unrealistic to modify genes of all kinds of flowers but we can look for other ways to suppress the (target) gene ... such as making cut flowers absorb a solution that prevents the gene from becoming active,' Professor Shibuya said. For some flowers, such as carnations, florists currently use chemicals to inhibit ethylene, a plant hormone which sometimes causes blooms to ripen. But ethylene is not involved in the ageing of some popular flowers, such as lilies, tulips and irises. A gene similar to Ephmeral1 could be responsible for petal ageing in these plants, Professor Shibuya said, meaning the ability to suppress it would extend their life. 'Unmodified flowers (stock image used) started withering 13 hours after they opened, but flowers that had been genetically modified stayed open for 24 hours,' said Kenichi Shibuya, one of the lead researchers in a study carried out jointly with Kagoshima University in southern Japan .","Scientists supressed 'Ephmeral1' gene to slow down ageing by half .

"It's not every day Pope Francis calls to wish you a happy New Year, so it might be a good idea to be at home when he rings up. But the problem for a group of Spanish nuns was they were busy praying when the Pontiff left a voicemail asking why they didn't pick up. 'What can the nuns be doing that stops them answering the phone?' said Pope Francis, chuckling, in the message he left on New Year's eve for the Barefoot Carmelites of Lucena. Scroll down for audio .

"Living with a snoring partner can be nothing short of torture. But former BBC journalist Rosie Millard claims to have found a cure to a problem which plagues millions of couples. Miss Millard says she was forced to search for a remedy after her husband recently began to snore, preventing her from sleeping. Problem solved: Rosie Millard and husband Pip Clothier who tried the Good Night Snoring Ring . Rather than use remedies such as nasal strips and mouth sprays, the mother of four says she persuaded her husband, 53-year-old TV producer Pip Clothier, to try the Good Night Snoring Ring, which works by applying acupressure to the wearer’s finger. She claims that the £30 silver device fixed the problem almost immediately. On her website, 47-year-old Miss Millard, BBC art correspondent between 1995 and 2004, said: ‘Mr Millard didn’t always snore. But recently, it’s been a bit noisy chez nous. So, he has tried two things. This is the first. The Good Night Snoring Ring. ‘As you can see, the ring has a . little dimple on one side, and a sort of shelf on the other. These are . crucial. They are twin acupressure points. 'Rather . like those car-sickness bands which press key positions on the . underside of your wrist (and work brilliantly), the snore ring does the . same on your finger. ‘Thirty minutes before slumber time, . The Snorer should place the ring at the base of his/her little finger . with the gap facing upwards. 'The . overall effect is that your partner is suddenly wearing a signet ring. Very posh. 'If you like this Downton effect, great. If you don’t, never . mind. Just turn over and go to sleep. You will not be disturbed. ‘In the morning, the ring comes off. You must not wear it during the day. Who knew?’ Miss Millard says the problem might also have been alleviated by a second measure. Her husband has taken up regular cycling, helping him lose weight. Around one in four women and four in ten men are frequent snorers, while half the population is said to snore occasionally. A recent US study has claimed that . snorers are more likely to have a heart attack than smokers or the . obese, and the condition could thicken the arteries, leading to brain . haemorrhages, strokes and heart attacks.

"A rejected lover paid a teenager £850 to burn down the home of the young woman who turned him down. Failed soldier Aiden Feeney, 24, launched a hate campaign against Scarlett O’Connor when she refused to go out with him after they had a one night stand, a court heard. He sent the 22-year-old as many as 3,000 text messages over four days, and became aggressive when Miss O’Connor continued to refuse his advances. Feeney spoke of ‘ripping her head off’ and told one friend he had a ‘contact who would burn down her house for £1,000’. Aiden Feeney, pictured right, hired a hitman to burn down the home of Scarlett O'Connor, left, in revenge for dumping him after a one night stand, a court heard . Scarlett O'Connor's sister Lauren was staying in the house (pictured) in Walkden, near Salford, Greater Manchester when the fire broke out forcing her to run from the property . The threats prompted firemen to carry . out an urgent risk assessment of the home Miss O’Connor shared with her . elder sister Lauren, install extra smoke alarms and tape up the . letterbox of the property as a precaution. The . attack went ahead, however, after Feeney paid Tyler Bennett, 19, to . carry out the job. He took a taxi to the house and threw firelighters . through the front window when he could not open the letterbox. It is . thought Miss O’Connor was staying at a friend’s home but the fire alarms . alerted her 29-year-old sister, who managed to escape uninjured.

For her this changed nothing and she said as such but . this infuriated you. The texts show increased frustration culminating in . threats to her life and well-being. ‘The . fire spread rapidly and set fire to furniture. Lauren said she was . terrified. She saw flames, smoke and could see possessions burn. She was . physically retching. Lauren then saw firelighters in a row on the . ground under the window. ‘You must both understand use of fire is an extremely serious form of criminality.’ The . court also heard how Miss O’Connor has moved to Australia following the . attack last September. Outside court, sister Lauren said: ‘It was . horrible. It was so scary – to watch my own house go up in flames. It . was the worst day of my life. You just do not expect anything like that . to happen to you in your entire life. ‘He . was going to put it through the letterbox. That would have been a very . different story if that had happened.

"Justice served: Blue Kalmbach, 16, was sentenced to 11 years in prison after pleading guilty to kidnapping, robbery and assault charges in the February attack on his former friend . An Oregon teenager who carved a swastika into a friend's forehead as he and others tortured the 16-year-old was sentenced today to 11 years in prison. In a Portland courtroom Thursday, 16-year-old Blue Kalmbach told the victim in a barely audible voice that he was 'very sincerely sorry,' later adding, 'I'm appalled at what I did,' according to KOMO News. Kalmbach was the last of four teenagers to be sentenced in the case. 'It's almost impossible to imagine this could happen between friends, but it did,' Multnomah County Judge Jean Kerr Maurer said when accepting Kalmbach's guilty pleas on kidnapping, robbery and assault charges. Police and prosecutors said the teens spent the evening before the February attack sketching out ideas for torturing the victim. Before Kalmbach carved the swastika with a box-cutter, they shot the victim with a BB gun in his private parts and chest, forced him to eat cat feces and hit with him a crow bar and cricket-type bat. The victim, Dustyn Murrain, bangs covering his forehead to hide the faded scar, sat with his mother and girlfriend in court. He did not make a statement or speak with reporters. His mother, Kelli Murrain, said the swastika has mostly healed, but her son, who turned 17 Wednesday, still has nightmares and suffers from post-traumatic stress, reported The Oregonian. She said he plans to attend an alternative high school this fall and study to become an auto mechanic. Accomplices: Jenna Montgomery, 15 (left), was sentenced last month to more than nine years for her role in the attack, and Jess Taylor, 17 (right), received a sentence of more than seven years . 'The biggest question I have is: ""How can anyone do this to another human being?""' she said in court. Later, she told reporters her son has yet to forgive Kalmbach, who once was his best friend. '[He's] still very angry, as I am,' she said. Public defender Casey Kovacic said the case is more complex than what has been reported. He described Kalmbach as a 'deeply, deeply depressed kid' who has never fit in. A statement from Kalmbach's parents said there's no excuse for what happened, but their son was in and out of therapy for mental issues before the attack. It is not entirely clear what triggered the teens to torture the victim. Kalmbach told investigators the victim had bullied him and called him a derogatory name on Facebook. The victim's mother, however, has said the boys had a falling out after a girl broke up with Kalmbach and started dating her son. The violence began when 15-year-old Jenna Montgomery, acting as a bait, invited the victim to hang out with her on February 10, 2014. Revenge plot: Kalmbach told investigators the 16-year-old victim had bullied him and called him a name on Facebook . Bait: Montgomery lured the victim to a shed after inviting him to spend time with her . After meeting up, they walked to a friend's home and into a backyard shed, where three boys confronted him. When Murrain questioned what his attackers wanted, they demanded he return with a skateboard and money, an affidavit said. They rifled through his pockets and stole his iPod. When the torture ended, Montgomery walked the victim out to the street and left him there. The victim was able to make his way to an auto service shop for help. Montgomery was sentenced last month to nearly 10 years in custody, and 17-year-old Jess Taylor was sentenced to seven years and nine months. A 14-year-old was sentenced in juvenile court to 10 years at the MacLaren Youth Correctional Facility.","Blue Kalmbach, 16, told the victim in Oregon court he was 'very sincerely sorry'

"Mr Justice Mitting, chairman of the Special Immigrations unit, ruled that the terror suspect could not be deported because it would breach his human rights . An Algerian terror suspect has been allowed to stay in Britain because a judge believes he may commit suicide if he is forced to go back home. The 43-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, does not dispute he is a risk to Britain's national security and is believed to support one of the terrorist groups which carried out the deadly attack on an Algerian gas plant earlier this month which claimed the lives of 39 hostages including six Britons. He is also suspected of providing fake passports and travel arrangements to terrorists. But in another blow for the Home Office, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) has allowed the married man to remain on British soil today because deporting him would breach his human rights. Making his ruling, Mr Justice Mitting - who recently allowed hate preacher Abu Qatada to stay in the UK -  said: . 'We must look at the totality of the psychiatric evidence in the round. 'We are persuaded by it that the risk that G would commit suicide, . especially after arrival in Algiers, is very high. 'It may be containable in the UK but no special arrangements have been negotiated with Algeria to cope with it.' In the same judgment, Mr Justice Mitting told six other Algerian terror suspects they must leave. But the senior immigration judge warned there was still 'no end in sight' in attempting to put the men on a flight home because they are likely to appeal the decision. Among the six men were two fundamentalists with links to an alleged 2003 plot to commit mass murder using the poison ricin and cohorts of hook-handed preacher Abu Hamza. The decision comes after a dramatic terror attack last week on a gas plant in Algeria, which claimed the lives of at least 39 foreign hostages, including six Britons. Hostages at the In Amenas gas facility during the siege earlier this months which claimed the lives of 39 foreigners including six Britons . Siac said the judgment was drafted before the In Amenas attack and it was too early to say if it would have an impact on its assessment of Algeria. In the wake of the crisis, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to put terrorism 'right at the top of the agenda' for Britain's presidency of the G8 nations in 2013. The successful appellant - who was referred to as ""G"" - claimed asylum in 1995 when he was caught entering the UK on a fake passport. A previously published open judgment revealed he did not dispute the Home Secretary's case that he poses a risk to national security. Mr Justice Mitting recently ruled that radical Muslim cleric Abu Qatada could stay in the country and released him on bail . He is a suspected supporter of Groupe Islamique Arme (GIA), an Islamist organisation that wants to overthrow the Algerian government, and the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, which is now known as Al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb. And he is understood to have supplied passports to terrorists and been involved in fundraising and providing travel to extremists undertaking jihad and terrorist training. But the extremist was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and is known to have made a suicide attempt in 2005 when he was found hanging in a cell in Belmarsh prison. Experts concluded that medication would not stop him from committing suicide and he instead required round the clock supervision. Mr Justice Mitting concluded that the UK would be in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights - that no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment - if he were deported in his present condition. The six suspects ordered to leave the country claimed they would be at risk of torture or degrading treatment if returned to Algeria. Among them is a regular visitor to the Finsbury Park mosque, who sided with hate preacher Abu Hamza, and a senior member of an Afghanistan training camp. But Mr Justice Mitting said the court was 'satisfied that the Algerian state's assurances can be relied upon' in the case of these men. He added that the relations between Algeria and the UK are strong and the North African country has a good record with other men who have previously been deported. However, in a sign that the six men are expected to drag out their fight against deportation, Mr Justice Mitting warned that after seven years of litigation there was 'as yet, no end in sight'. The Prime Minister pledged support to international efforts to track down and tear up the terror network behind last week's attack on the In Amenas gas plant. Mr Cameron said that the world was involved in a 'generational struggle' against al Qaida-inspired Islamist terrorism in North Africa. Siac upheld Qatada's appeal against deportation to Jordan, where he was convicted of terror charges in his absence in 1999. The Government will appeal against the decision next month but Qatada remains in the UK on bail conditions including a 16-hour curfew, wearing an electronic tag, not using the internet and not contacting certain people. A Home Office spokesman said: 'We are pleased Siac has dismissed the appeals of six of the individuals in the 'W and Others' case against their deportation, recognising the strength of our assurances with Algeria. We intend to remove them as quickly as possible.'","The 43-year-old does not dispute he is a threat to national security .

"Could Anne Hathaway be the next victim of the 'Oscar's Curse?' The Les Miserables star will be crossing her fingers tonight in hope that she is named the Best Actress in a Supporting Role. But if her name is called then the odds of her having a happy marriage will be slashed dramatically. Loved up: Newlyweds Anne Hathaway and Adam Shulman will hope their marriage can survive if she takes home the Best Supporting Actress award tonight . Female winners of the coveted prize are 63 per cent more likely to have a shorter marriage than those who do not win the famous award. The last casualty of the winner's curse was Sandra Bullock. Weeks after posing happily on whose marriage to Jesse James dissolved within days of her claiming the prize for her role in The Blind Side, amid accusations he had been unfaithful. The actress is far from alone in seeing their relationship disintegrate after winning acting's ultimate prize. The year before Bullock, Kate Winslet won the Academy Award for her performance in The Reader. Despite appearing to be as close as ever, the couple ended their marriage a year after her win. Of the 266 married women who have been nominated for the Best Actress award from the beginning of the modern Oscars in 1936 to the present, 159 of them got divorced, or 60 per cent. Winners of the gong are 1.68 times more likely to head to the divorce court than losers. Curse of the Oscars? Kate Winslet and Sam Mendes announced their divorce a year after she won the Best Actress Oscar for The Reader in 2009 and Reese Witherspoon split from her husband Ryan Phillippe in 2007 - one year after she took home the Best Actress award for Walk The Line . Shockingly, studies have shown that there is virtually no change in the status of married men. Among the other 'victims' of the curse are Julia Roberts, who thanks boyfriend Benjamin Bratt in her victory speech for Erin Brockovich. Three months later the pair had split up. Halle Berry became the first black woman to win an Oscar for Monster's Ball and posed ecstatically with husband Eric Benet. However, they separated the following year. Two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank ducked the curse when she won her award for Boys Don't Cry in 1999. But her marriage to Chad Lowe did not survive her second award and the pair ended their nine year marriage in 2006. Cursed: Actress Hilary Swank and husband of nine years Chad Lowe announced their separation a year after she won the Best Actress Oscar for Million Dollar Baby, while Halle Berry and husband Eric Benet lasted longer than most of contemporaries. They split three years after she won the Oscar for Monsters Ball in 2002 . Sandra Bullock's marriage to Jesse James ended within days of her winning the Oscar for The Blind Side amid accusations he had been unfaithful. Julia Roberts and her boyfriend Benjamin Bratt announced the end of their relationship with months of her 2001 Best Actress Oscar for Erin Brockovich . Researcher Tiziana Casciaro from the . University of Toronto said the sudden elevation in fame could play a . part in the increased divorce rate. 'Winning an Oscar can be construed as a big jump in professional status . that an actor or actress has in their world and in the eyes of the . broader audience,' said Casciaro. “The general social norm kind of requires a man to have higher professional and economic status over the wife. 'So whenever that social norm is violated, both husband and wife may feel discomfort—could be either one of them.' It is not only modern stars that have succumbed to the curse. Among the first was Joan Crawford who divorced her third husband in 1946 a year after winning an Oscar for Mildred Pierce.",Newlyweds Anne Hathaway and Adam Shulman will hope their marriage can survive if she wins the Best Actress in a Supporting Role Academy Award .
"A Michigan teen authorities believe abandoned her newborn baby on the side of a dirt road just hours after its birth acted completely ignorant as she watched her neighbors discover the child.

Kopp's daughter Cathleen Neal points out the area on the side of the road where the newborn had been left on its side . Kopp realized the rabbit was really a baby when the dog reached a satellite dish about three feet off the road. 'Then it moved,' he said. 'That’s when I started yelling.' Kopp and his family wrapped the baby in a towel to keep her from the chill and pealed the leaves from her face as they waited for paramedics to arrive.

"Migrants who hope to become British citizens will have to learn about 1066, Rudyard Kipling and Olympic hero Jessica Ennis under new citizenship tests, ministers said yesterday. They will be examined on their knowledge of William the Conqueror, the Reformation and Oliver Cromwell in a reformed version of the tests that must be passed before qualifying for a passport. But some names familiar to schoolchildren will be missed out of the tests developed by the Home Office. Question: Those taking the test will be expected to be familiar with details of sporting events including the Olympic Games and to know about sporting icons such as heptathlete Jessica Ennis (pictured) While the Life in the UK handbooks . praise Florence Nightingale as ‘the founder of modern nursing’, there is . no mention of Mary Seacole, her Jamaican-born contemporary promoted . over the past two decades as of equal importance. The decision to omit Miss Seacole is . the second indignity her reputation has suffered in a month. At the end . of last year Education Secretary Michael Gove instructed she should no . longer be part of the National Curriculum. The handbook, to teach newly-arrived . migrants ‘the values and principles at the heart of being British’, also . contains no use of the word ‘multicultural’. History exams will be introduced for . those wanting to take out British citizenship in March, and the handbook . they must study is available today. The citizenship tests first brought in . by Labour seven years ago contained no questions on history or the . development of British culture, and instead concentrated on ensuring . migrants had grasped practicalities like how to make a GP appointment or . claim benefits.

"Scientists have developed breakthrough drugs that cure skin cancer. The treatment is already having ‘spectacular’ effects in seriously ill melanoma patients – and could soon be used to defeat other types of cancer. One scientist said it was ‘amazing’ that researchers could talk  of ‘using the C-word – cure’ for the first time, while another said trials among kidney and lung cancer patients are ‘very exciting’. Each year almost 13,000 people in Britain are diagnosed with melanoma, including two people aged 15 to 34 every day . One in six patients ravaged by deadly skin cancer are already being cured by the drugs, the European Cancer Congress was told yesterday, with the possibility of more than half being saved with an new combination. The astonishing development will save  the lives of thousands of patients with advanced melanoma, who usually die within months of being diagnosed. The new treatment, which will bring hope to  hundreds of thousands of people in Britain with terminal conditions, involves the combination of two  different types of drug that ‘reboot’ the immune system. The first is ipilimumab – or ‘ipi’. According to research presented to the European congress in Amsterdam yesterday, 17 per cent of patients are cured by this drug alone. But many more – perhaps more than half – could be ‘clinically cured’ by combining them with even newer drugs called anti-PD1s which break down cancer cells’ defences. Professor Alexander Eggermont of the Institut Gustave Roussy in France said: ‘[Advanced] melanoma could become a curable disease for perhaps more than 50 per cent of patients within five to 10 years.’ He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘If I’d made this bizarre prediction five years ago, people would have said I was mad. But it now looks like we are going to have control of advanced melanoma for years, in a substantial proportion of patients.’ Each year almost 13,000 people in Britain are diagnosed with melanoma, including two people aged 15 to 34 every day. It kills 2,200 a year, accounting for four in five skin cancer deaths. The number of cases has quadrupled in 30 years, due in part to our fondness for foreign holidays to sunny destinations. If caught early enough, malignant moles can be cut out before the cancer spreads, but if it is missed and the cancer turns ‘metastatic’ – spreading to other organs – chances of long term survival plummet. At that stage patients are usually told they have just months to live. Currently, less than a quarter survive a year or more. Prof Eggermont believed these new immunotherapy drugs would be adopted ‘across the board’ to successfully treat a wide range of other advanced ‘solid tumour’ cancers. He said: ‘These drugs are going to help a large number of people. It’s a massive deal. Reports from trials with patients who have advanced kidney and lung cancer are very exciting.’ In one lung cancer trial using anti-PD1 drugs, tumours markedly shrank in a quarter of very ill patients who had failed to respond to chemotherapy, he said. Trials had also been started in patients with prostate, bowel and breast cancer. Prof Stephen Hodi, of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, found encouraging results in the survival chances of almost 5,000 melanoma patients put on ipi.  ‘This is a really amazing time,’ he said. ‘A few years ago we could never have imagined using the C-word – cure – in melanoma. But we are headed that way.’ Cancer scientists have tried for decades to create drugs which help the immune system fight cancer, but until very recently immunotherapy appeared to be a dead-end. Prof Eggermont said 24 of his 27 years in the field had been ‘very  difficult .  .  . I couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.’ Most attempts had failed because they had concentrated on the wrong thing: activating cancer-fighting  T-cells, rather than breaking down the tumours’ defences. He said: ‘All these attempts ended when they came up against the wall of defence. We needed to break down that wall and open up the tumour to attack, which ipi and the anti-PD1s do in different ways. Now it’s a totally different ball game.’ British experts yesterday said there was ‘enormous excitement’ at the new drugs – although they stressed it was still early days. Professor Peter Johnson, chief  clinician at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘We have always thought that if you can get the immune system to respond to a tumour, then it’s likely to be a long-lasting effect, because the immune system is designed to last for life. So it’s very exciting that we are starting to see it working.’ Dr James Larkin, of the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, said ipi alone was ‘a vast improvement’ on previous treatment. ‘Traditionally, when melanoma has spread to other organs, it is regarded as incurable. So this is big news. ‘It’s difficult to know that we have actually ‘cured’ people, because we have to wait to see if they die from something else. But all this new ipi data points to the fact that if you respond to the drug and are still alive three years after treatment, then it’s very likely that you are  clinically cured. It’s a very big story.’ The breakthrough comes after David Cameron announced the extension of a £200 million-a-year budget to pay for cancer treatments denied to NHS patients because rationing body NICE believes they are poor value for money. Ipi is already available on the NHS, under the brand name Yervoy, although its course of four treatments is very expensive. Dr Larkin is now working on a trial  to combine ipi with anti-PD1 and said early results have shown ‘spectacular levels of tumour shrinkage’. Initial trial results presented  earlier this year showed that tumours shrank by more than half in 11 per cent of patients put on ipi, in 41 per cent put on anti-PD1s – but in 53 per cent of those given both. Professor Paul Workman of the Institute of Cancer Research described the immune-boosters as ‘a real breakthrough’, adding: ‘I think we will have the expertise to take more patients to five, ten years [of life] and eventually cure them.’ Charlotte Fionda of the Karen  Clifford Skin Cancer Charity said: ‘It is really encouraging to see positive data. We hope that this is just the beginning.’","New treatment combine two different drugs that 'reboot' immune system .

"Controversial: Disgraced cycling star Lance Armstrong today insisted that ¿it is impossible to win the Tour de France 'without doping' Disgraced cycling star Lance Armstrong today insisted that ‘it is impossible to win the Tour de France 'without doping.’ His words will infuriate British hero Sir Bradley Wiggins who last year became the first Englishman in history to win the epic race. Armstrong won it a record-breaking seven consecutive times between 1999 and 2005 before being disqualified for life for taking drugs. Today Armstrong, 41, tells Le Monde: ‘It is impossible to win the Tour de France without doping. Because the Tour is an endurance test, where oxygen is crucial. ‘Just to give you one example – EPO [the blood booster erythropoietin] won’t help a sprinter win the 100 metres, but it will make all the difference for a runner doing the 10,000 metres. It’s obvious.’ The American was responding to the revelations that the 1998 French winner, Laurent Jalabert, used EPO. Traces have since been found in DNA samples taken from urine provided by Jalabert during the race. Speaking on the eve of this year’s race, Armstrong said that he ‘hadn’t invented doping’, adding: ‘Doping has always existed and it always will. I just participated in a system. I’m a human being.’ Questioned further about Jalabert, . who has denied all the accusations against him, Armstrong said: ‘I’ve . got a lot of respect for Jaja, but he’s lying.’ Armstrong . was banned from professional cycling in October 2012 when the US . Anti-Doping Agency, USADA, accused him of leading ‘the most . sophisticated, professional and successful doping program that sport has . ever seen.’ After . consistently denying the drug accusations for years, Armstrong finally . admitted what he had done, telling the Oprah Winfrey talk show: ‘It is . my fault. I view this situation as one big lie.’ Tension: His words will infuriate British hero Sir Bradley Wiggins who last year became the first Englishman in history to win the epic race . The American, seen left during one of his many Tour de France victories,  was responding to the revelations that the 1998 French winner, right, Laurent Jalabert, used EPO . Armstrong told Le Monde that he continues to train hard and will ‘try to watch some of the Tour de France on television’. Sir Bradley, who is out of this year's Tour because of an injury, has always insisted that he is completely clear of drugs. Armstrong was also forced to resign down from his Livestrong cancer foundation, which has raised millions for charity. Last month Nike cut ties with Livestrong after helping turn the foundation and its trademark yellow rubber wristbands into a global brand. The move by the sports shoe and clothing company ends a relationship that began in 2004 and helped the foundation raise more than $100million. Brood: Armstrong is pictured with his ex-wife Kristin and his other three children - son Luke and daughters Isabella Rose and Grace Elizabeth in 2003 after winning his fifth Tour de France . But the relationship soured with revelations that Armstrong and members of his legendary U.S. Postal Service team used performance-enhancing drugs. Nike said it will stop making its Livestrong line of apparel after the 2013 holiday season. Foundation and company officials said Nike will honor the financial terms of its contract until it expires in 2014. Nike dropped its personal sponsorship of Armstrong last October after U.S. Anti-Doping Agency exposed the team doping program and portrayed Armstrong as its ringleader. And after years of denials, Armstrong admitted earlier this year he used performance-enhancing drugs to win the Tour de France seven times. Officials at Livestrong, which announced the split on Tuesday, said the foundation remains strong and committed to helping cancer patients worldwide through its survivorship programs. Confession: Armstrong admitted to Oprah Winfrey that his seven Tour de France titles were won with the help of performance-enhancing drugs, but he denied that he used them for his 2009 comeback . Shamed: Armstrong told Oprah that he never tried to stop or change the culture of drug use in the sport . Armstrong, who started the charity in . 1997 as the Lance Armstrong Foundation, was pushed off the board of . directors in October and the organization later changed its formal name . to Livestrong. During a televised interview with Winfrey screened on January 17, he said 'I view this situation as one big lie that I repeated a lot of times.' He admitted that he doped in some . form for each of his seven Tour de France victories, though he . maintained that the last time that he 'crossed that line' was in 2005. The distinction of before and after . 2005 is important as that was the last year that capped off his . incredible seven-year winning streak at the Tour de France. Team Lance: Lance Armstrong said his former wife . Kristin, left in 2001, and his current girlfriend Anna Hansen, right in . 2011, were supportive of regarding his drugs admission in January . On top of the outright confession, he . said that part of the reason why it carried on for as long as it did . was because he 'didn't feel like' he was cheating. 'The definition of cheat is to gain . an advantage on a rival or foe that they didn't have. I didn't view it . that way. I viewed it as a level playing field,' he said. He described the elaborate doping . ring that he and his teammates developed was not quite as legendary as . the investigatory commissions described it. 'It was definitely professional and . it was definitely smart if you can call it that but it was very . conservative, very risk averse, and very aware of what mattered,' he . said. 'While I've lived through this process ... I know the truth the truth isn’t what is out there, the truth isn't what I said. 'I didn't invent the culture but I . didn't try to stop the culture and that's my mistake. The sport is now . paying the price for that, and I am sorry for that. 'This story was so perfect for so . long- and I mean that as I try to take myself out of this situation- . it’s this mythic, perfect story and that wasn't true, on a lot of . levels.'","Armstrong, 41, won a record-breaking seven .

"A British man has been arrested in Spain after allegedly calling police officers at the Gibraltar border 'torturers' and publishing pictures of them on the internet. The man, named by Spanish media as Emilio Esteban, launched the verbal assault on a website in retaliation for long queues at the Gibraltan border caused by security checks. He was arrested in Madrid yesterday afternoon. In the statement, Esteban allegedly said: 'Here are The Faces of Spanish Border ... 'TORTURERS' 'They . look like ordinary men and women but these ""criminals"" are the people . who, according to Gibraltarians, have ""tortured"" innocent tourists and . travellers.' Using a Spanish slag word for protest, the post added: 'You don't have to be a victim of police abuse. Escrache the Guardia Civil!' Queues at the Gibraltar boarder have been caused by increased security checks the Spanish claim are to prevent smuggling . People have been forced to wait in their cars for hours in blistering summer heat . The border checks have been in place since July causing hours of tailbacks in blistering summer heat and sparking a diplomatic row. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo has said he supports Argentina over the Falklands and wants Gibraltar to be 'decolonised' too . The Spanish claim they are to prevent smuggling but many believe they have been imposed in protest at Gibraltar's decision to build an artificial reef in contested waters off the coast. There have been reports of stones being thrown at boarder guards and insults being shouted. It is not known if Esteban comes from Gibraltar, where many Britons have Spanish names, but police revealed he has pleaded not guilty. Jorge Fernandez Diaz, Spain's interior minister, said the post was 'an intolerable attack on security forces and the rule of law.' The news came on the same day that the Spanish foreign minister offered his support for Argentina's bid to win back control of the Falkland Islands. Speaking while on a trip to Uruguay Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said the similarities between the two were 'enormous' and that both needed to be 'decolonised'. He also criticised Britain for siding with the 30,000 inhabitants, most of whom say they like British rule, though added that he would welcome a discussion on the issue any time.","The British man, named locally as Emilio Esteban, posted attack online .

"A new Red Bull advert which makes light of the sinking of the Titanic has outraged relatives of those who died in the tragedy.

The Advertising Standards Authority has also received 46 official complaints about the animated advert. Scroll down for video .

As the crate ascends, a dockworker (left) utters the catchphrase that the drink 'gives you wings' to the captain (right) The cartoon shows a crate of the drink - which advertisers say 'gives you wings' - being winched onto an unidentified ship. The captain asks a dockhand what the drink is, and on hearing the beverage's catchphrase - that 'it gives you wings' he questions why a ship would ever need wings. The crate is then lowered from the ship - revealing that the boat in question is the Titanic, which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912, leading to more than 1,500 deaths. The captain (right) dismissed the notion that a ship could need 'wings' and walks off as the vessel is revealed to be the Titanic . Relatives of victims and campaigners have claimed that the advert is in bad taste because it suggests an energy drink may have saved their lives . The Titanic Heritage Trust, formed to 'preserve, protect, respect and remember' those who died in the tragedy, has condemned the advert. Trust founder Howard Nelson said he was considering complaining to advertising regulators. He said: 'It is very offensive and just disrespectful. 'We . appreciate there will be commercial ventures involving the Titanic . which we say is fine - as long as it is in good taste and respectful. This is not. 'There is a difference between making a joke and this. 'I get jokes all the time about icebergs and the like, taking the mick out of my interest in the Titanic, but that is banter. 'This is blatantly offensive because it is taking the mick out of the people who have passed away. 'It would be the same if someone did something similar about 9/11 - there would be an uproar. This is no different.' Red Bull has so far refused to comment on objections to the advert, which has prompted 46 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority . Clifford Ismay, 57, a relative of Titanic owner Joseph Bruce Ismay, called the advert 'despicable'. He . said: 'I have a sense of humour but I really don’t like the idea - in . fact I find it quite sickening considering so many people died on that . night. 'With their . slogan ‘Red Bull gives you wings’ I can only assume that they are . referring to the idea that if all those people had Red Bull - or wings - . then they would have been OK. 'I don’t mind people making a joke about things, but I don’t think lots . of people dying like that is something you should be laughing at. 'It’s despicable. I think the Titanic, and the people involved, should be treated with dignity and respect.'

"Gay marriage advocates expressed outrage on Thursday over a court document filed by lawyers for the state of Pennsylvania that likens same-sex marriage to a partnership between 12-year-olds. Lawyers for the Pennsylvania Department of Health included the statement in their lawsuit against a county clerk who has been issuing marriage licenses to gay couples despite a state ban on same-sex nuptials. 'Had the Clerk issued marriage licenses to twelve-year-olds in violation of state law, would anyone seriously contend that each twelve-year-old has a legally enforceable ""interest"" in his ""license"" and is entitled to a hearing on the validity of his 'license,' else his due process rights be violated?' the state lawyers wrote. Grown-up choices: Gay advocates are infuriated by the statements included in a lawsuit that compare marriage between gay adults to that of 12-year-olds . Lawsuit: The Department of Health is suing clerk D. Bruce Hanes for issuing the licenses . Charles Joughin, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, said not only is the statement offensive, it is flawed. 'Same-sex couples enter into marriage for the same reasons as opposite-sex couples: love, commitment and family. Children are not capable of giving consent, a critical component of legal marriage,' Joughin said in a statement. Pennsylvania General Counsel James Schultz said the media mischaracterized the statement. Marriage equality: Montgomery County Clerk D. Bruce Hanes has been issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples despite a state ban on gay marriage . On the defense: General Counsel James Schultz denies state lawyers compared gay marriage to child marriage . 'Contrary to recent headlines, the administration does NOT equate same-sex marriage to the marriage of minors,' Schultz said in a statement. The state's intention, he said, was to give examples of 'other individuals whose marriages were excluded under state law.' Offensive: Charles Joughin, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign says the statements made by State lawyers are deeply flawed and offensive . But Timothy Haggerty, a historian at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who has studied the gay rights movement, called the statement 'incredibly condescending.' 'It's suggesting that adult members of our society are incapable of entering into contract because of their sexual orientation,' Haggerty said. 'It's calling gay relationships adolescent, which has long been a tool of homophobia.' The state last month sued Montgomery County Clerk D. Bruce Hanes in an attempt to stop him from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in suburban Philadelphia, a practice he started after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages in states where it is legal. Soon after the high court ruled, Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane announced she would not defend the state's ban on same-sex marriage. Thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia recognize gay marriage. Pennsylvania is among six potential states targeted by gay marriage advocates for a future push to legalize same sex nuptials in 2015 and 2016, according to the Freedom to Marry advocacy group. A poll conducted by Franklin & Marshall College in May found that 54 per cent of Pennsylvanians surveyed support gay marriage. Another conducted in August found 76 per cent disagreed with the Montgomery County clerk's decision to issue same-sex marriage licenses in violation of current state law. On Thursday, the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service announced that legally married gay and lesbian couples will be recognized as married for federal tax purposes even if the couples live in or move to a state that does not recognize marriage for same-sex couples.","Lawyers for the Pennsylvania Department of Health likened gay marriage to a marriage between 12-year-olds .

"Complaint: Ashley Jessica posted a video claiming she was touched inappropriately by a TSA agent . A video has been posted on the internet by a woman who claims she was 'violated' by a TSA agent during a full body check. Ashley Jessica, 25, from Toronto, Canada, claims the clip shows the female agent touching her unnecessarily at  San Diego International Airport. Jessica is an activist who fronted an anti-TSA opt-out campaign last year which urged people  'to film the TSA and to post the footage . to youtube in an effort to raise awareness and to stop the tyrannical . practices of the TSA.' Jessica and her mother both requested a full body scan and took turns filming what they perceived as improper conduct. The footage, which lasts just over three minutes, captures the incident on 23 May. In the video Jessica repeatedly tells the unidentified TSA female agent not to touch her vagina, breasts, or her mother's private parts. Jessica told InfoWars.com . that she and her mother were told by the TSA agent that they would . undergo 'an extensive pat down which would involve going all the way up . the leg.'

She also told me that I had to let her . touch my other private areas with the backs of her hands or I would not . be permitted to fly.' In an interview last year she told her idea for the campaign stemmed from a 'bad experience.' 'I was ordered around like a prisoner by the TSA agent,' she said.

The TSA guidelines say: 'If a passenger cannot or chooses not to be screened by imaging technology or a walk-through metal detector, the passenger will be screened using a thorough patdown procedure instead. A patdown procedure also is used to resolve any alarms of a metal detector or anomalies identified by imaging technology.' They state that they must be performed by an officer of the same gender and 'the officer will explain the pat-down process before and during the pat-down.'

The TSA told MailOnline: 'It is the passenger’s choice to either walk through the screening equipment or receive a secondary screening using a pat-down. 'In review of the closed-circuit video, it is abundantly clear that the two TSA officers conducting the pat-down carried out their responsibilities in a professional and polite manner and according to procedure, offering the passengers the opportunity to have the pat-down conducted in a private setting and taking time to explain each step along the way.'","Ashley Jessica is a a PhD student and researcher from Toronto, Canada .

"When comedian Jay Leno invited Cpt Ethan LeBerge for a ride in a shiny red muscle car, the soldier had no idea that he would walk away from the experience as the proud owner of a 2015 Dodge Hellcat. LeBerge, who has been severely wounded in Afghanistan, became the subject of Today Show's 'Shine a Light' segment featuring Mr Leno, which aired Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, the 64-year-old entertainer announced his decision to cancel his attendance at an upcoming gun trade show in response to a petition by the Newton Action Alliance. Scroll down for video . Special surprise: Comedian Jay Leno (left) surprised Cpl Ethan LeBerge (right) by gifting him a brand-new muscle car worth at least $60,000 . Humble hero: Cpl LeBerge was seriously wounded in a suicide bombing while serving in Afghanistan . Attention-grabbing car: Leno visited Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where LeBerge is stationed, and offered the unsuspecting soldier to go for a spin in this shiny red 2015 Dodge Hellcat . On the road: Leno, a passionate car collector, even let LeBerge get behind the wheel . The former Tonight Show host, who in October traveled to Afghanistan to entertain troops as part of a Today Show USO tour, said that they conducted a lottery at the time to select one service member to be awarded a special prize. Unbeknownst to him, Cpl LeBerge ended up being that lucky soldier. LeBerge had been on a foot patrol with his unit in Afghanistan when a suicide bomber drove up to them and set off an explosion that killed two soldiers and injured Ethan. LeBerge came away from the blast riddled with shrapnel and suffering from numerous broken bones and a traumatic brain injury. After undergoing 10 surgeries, the soldier is still wearing an air cast on his right arm and is in near-constant pain. ‘If you called Cpl. Leberge a hero, he'd laugh,’ Sgt Clinton Lien said. ‘He'd never consider himself a hero but he is to guys like us.’ Mr Leno has recently met up with Ethan LeBerge and his comrades, many of them barely out of their teens, on the base in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, . At the end of the ride, Leno stunned LeBerge by handing him the keys to the Dodge with the words, 'it's your' Hugging it out: The two embraced, and Leno warned LeBerge not to get any tickets driving the 700-horsepower machine . In an effort to surprise LeBerge, Leno invited him to check out some old muscle cars, before introducing his new friend to a fire engine-red 2015 Dodge SRT Hellcat, which comes with a price tag of $59,995 for the most basic model. Mr Leno then offered an unsuspecting LeBerge to go for a spin with him in the 700-horsepower vehicle. With Leno in the driver's seat, the Dodge Hellcat took to the open road, zooming past a sheriff's patrol car and an Amish horse and buggy. The veteran comic later let an overjoyed LeBerge get behind the wheel. Upon their return to the base, LeBerge jokingly lamented that it would be tough for him to go back to driving his old Chevy Tahoe after experiencing the Hellcat. 'I wouldn't mind having one of these,' he told Leno with a grin. Entertainer: The idea to select a wounded soldier to receive a special prize came to Leno back in October when he traveled to Afghanistan as part of an USO tour . Comic relief: Leno, 64, is pictured on stage entertaining troops overseas . 'It’s yours,' replied the veteran of late-night TV, handing a stunned LeBerge the keys to the brand-new Dodge. Leno then embraced the humble infantryman, thanking him for his service. 'America loves you,' he said, 'Have a lot of fun. Don't get any tickets.' In January, Jay Leno will auction off one of his 130 cars in Scottsdale, Arizona, and donate the proceeds to the USO. The same day the heart-warming segment about Ethan LeBerge was aired on NBC, it was announced that Jay Leno has decided to pull out from the annual Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show, sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) - the trade association for the gun industry. Obsessed: The former Tonight Show host has a massive collection of 130 cars from different eras . Good deed: Leno will auction off one of his cars in January, with the proceeds going to the USO . No show: Leno, 64, has canceled his upcoming appearance at a gun trade show in response to a petition submitted by anti-gun violence groups . According to a press release from the Newtown Action Alliance, Leno’s cancelation comes just hours after three gun violence prevention groups had launched a petition asking him not to attend the event. Leno called Po Murray, the chairman of the NAA, saying that he was unaware that the NSSF was a pro-gun lobbying group based in Newtown, Connecticut - the site of the 2012 school massacre. ‘We are sincerely grateful to Mr. Leno for making this decision so quickly after it was brought to his attention,’ said Josh Horwitz, the executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ‘It shows that he cares about all the Americans whose lives have .","Leno, 64, randomly selected Cpl Ethan LeBerge to receive 2015 Dodge Hellcat, worth at least $59,995 .

"Plans have been drawn up for an advertising campaign denouncing Britain as cold and wet to deter Romanians and Bulgarians from coming to the UK. Ministers are working on ideas to prevent an influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe when restrictions are lifted on citizens from the two countries moving to the EU next New Year's Day. A public information campaign would warn those considering a move that they won't be able to cash in on state largesse – and that the weather is bad. With a lifting of regulations on Romanians and Bulgarians in the UK the Government is considering a number of options to avoid the country's border being clogged with new migrants . Under proposals being examined in Downing Street, the Home Office and the Department for Work and Pensions, the new migrants – who are expected to number at least 70,000 over the next five years – would face tough restrictions on the benefits they could claim. One option would see new arrivals deported after three months if they don't have a job. Another plan would require those arriving from Romania and Bulgaria to show they have the means to support themselves for six months. The 'nuclear option' would be to declare an 'economic emergency' to defer arrivals – though government lawyers are nervous about the legality of such a move. Once the plans to limit the amount of money new arrivals can claim are in place they are likely to form the heart of an advertising campaign later this year. A senior Government source told the Mail: 'By the time people are able to come here we would want to have something in place and we would want people considering coming here to know what they could expect.' A minister said an advertising campaign was needed to 'correct the impression that the streets here are paved with gold'. David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May are concerned new arrivals will wreck efforts to slash immigration – a key election pledge. One of those involved in discussions said: 'Every single thing we've done on immigration risks being blown out of the water by this. Bettering Labour on immigration is one of the best cards we have.' But despite the warnings of restrictions, agencies have sprung up in Romania and Bulgaria offering to arrange work in the UK. Britain has a buoyant job market, in contrast to some EU nations, and access to welfare payments is easier than in Germany or France, which will be relaxing work restrictions at the same time. One job agency in the Romanian capital Bucharest told undercover reporters it has hundreds registering for work in the UK and the waiting list is so long they are no longer accepting applications. While the minimum wage in the UK is £6.19 per hour, in Bulgaria it is just 73p and, in Romania, 79p. The average weekly wage is £63.50 in Bulgaria and £86 in Romania. The only state benefit available in either country is child benefit, which is £3.50 per child per week in Bulgaria and £3.69 in Romania. In Britain, a single person can claim up to £71 a week in jobseekers' allowance. Housing benefit varies depending on local authorities. Child benefit adds another £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for each one after that. Visitors from the European Economic Area who demonstrate they 'have or retain worker status may be able to claim income-based jobseekers' allowance, income support, housing benefit, council tax benefit, income-related employment and support allowance, and state pension credit.","At least 70,000 thought come to UK over the next five years .

"Condemned: Angry viewers says Neil Warnock's comments reinforced a homophobic stereotype . A Premier League manager has been accused of homophobia after he criticised his team for playing 'like fairies'. Furious viewers said the comment from QPR boss Neil Warnock on BBC sports show Match of the Day Live was a stereotype and should not have been screened. The BBC's complaints department agreed the remark was unwelcome and apologised that it had not been redressed while the programme had been on air. It said it would not take any further action because programme-makers had already 'expressed regret'. Warnock's comments came in a TV interview broadcast on April 23, after his team's 2-2 draw with Cardiff City. He said: 'We defended like fairies in the first half but the first two goals could have come straight out of the Premier League.' The BBC's editorial complaints unit (ECU) said: 'The remark was unacceptable, and it was a matter of regret that it had gone unnoticed by the programme-makers, and therefore without comment or apology, at the time. 'However, the programme-makers had already acknowledged the unacceptability of the remark and expressed regret that it had not been dealt with appropriately. 'In the view of the ECU, this was sufficient to resolve the matter.' A BBC spokeswoman said: 'This was a live interview of which we had no editorial control.

"An 18-year-old Pennsylvania man has been arrested for allegedly raping a 5-year-old female relative and infecting her with an STD. According to the Upper Darby Police Department, Luis Arevelo sexually assaulted the child in his room several months ago. On Tuesday, the little girl was taken by her mother to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, where doctors determined that the 5-year-old was suffering from chlamydia – a common sexually transmitted disease that can cause permanent damage to a woman's reproductive system. Vile crime: Luis Arevelo, of Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, has been charged with rape of a child and indecent sexual assault for allegedly having sex with a 5-year-old female relative . When police officers responded to the hospital and interviewed the 5-year-old's mother, the woman reportedly admitted that her daughter had previously come to her saying that Arevelo 'stuck his pee pee in her private parts.' Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood said that the child anatomically knew that the term was referring to her 'vagina and buttocks.' Arevelo has been charged with rape of a child, indecent sexual assault, endangering the welfare of a child and other counts. ‘I guess the best way for me to describe this guy is an animal,’ Superintendent Chitwood told NBC 10. The teenager has denied raping his young relative in his bedroom, but he admitted to having an STD. He is being held at the Delaware County Prison on $250,000 bail, reported Philly.com. Infected: The allegations against Arevelo came to light Tuesday when the 5-year-old girl tested positive for chlamydia. Pictured here is the Chlamydia trachomatis Bacteria . Arevelo is a native of Ecuador who has been living in Upper Darby legally. The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has issued a legal notice to the Upper Darby police informing them that the federal agency intends to take Arevelo into custody. According to Chitwood, the 18-year-old told police following his arrest that he would like to serve his prison sentence back home in Ecuador. The victim’s mother has not been charged in the case.","Luis Arevelo, of Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, charged with rape of a child and indecent sexual assault .

"A lump of fat the size of a double decker bus has been discovered clogging a London sewer. The Fatberg, described as 15 tonnes of festering food mixed with wet wipes and a host of other disgusting ephemera, was found blocking pipes under Kingston in south London. The revolting mass caused sewage flows through the pipes to be reduced to five per cent of normal capacity and was created by people pouring cooking oils down the drain and flushing sanitary products. Scroll down for video through the sewer . Screen grab from CCTV footage of a giant 'fatberg' discovered in a sewer under the streets of Kingston in south London. It was described as the size of a double decker bus . The blockage was so critical it threatened to blast untreated sewage through manhole covers onto the streets of one of the leafiest London boroughs. Engineers who found the colossal blockage of congealed fat said they had never seen anything like it. Gordon Hailwood, waste contracts supervisor for Thames Water said: 'We've never seen a single, congealed lump of lard this big clogging our sewers before. 'Given we've got the biggest sewers and this is the biggest fatberg we've encountered, we reckon it has to be the biggest such 'berg' in British history. Rivers of filth: If workers hadn't cleared the mass, raw sewage could have spurted out of manholes across the whole of Kingston . 'The sewer was almost completely clogged with over 15 tonnes of fat. 'If we hadn't discovered it in time, raw sewage could have started spurting out of manholes across the whole of Kingston.' The blockage was discovered after residents in nearby flats complained they couldn't flush their toilets and repairs could take six weeks to complete. Workmen used a high-pressure jet of water to blast away the massive blockage over 10 nights.

"Two employees at a North Dakota barbecue restaurant have been fired after a Facebook post suggesting Native Americans are bad tippers went viral. The post included a photograph of Andrea Casson, a worker at Famous Dave's in Bismarck, holding a cardboard sign that says: 'Spare change? Help, I'm a server at Famous Dave's on Pow Wow weekend. Anything helps! 5c, 25c! It's more than my tips.' The United Tribes International Pow Wow, held last weekend in Bismark, is an annual festival that attracts tens of thousands of Native Americans to the area. Scroll down for video . Fired: This photograph of Andrea Casson, a worker at Famous Dave's in Bismarck, North Dakota, got her and a colleague fired . Casson was pictured in the restaurant wearing her uniform. She and the employee who took the photo were both fired. The other employee hasn't been named. 'Like many employers, we employ many people. People have opinions. Social media allows an outlet for these opinions,' owner Mike Wright said in a statement on Facebook. 'Sadly, for reasons unknown to me, often times bitter employees also try to embarrass the employers and taint the businesses where they work. Clearly a recent post by a now former employee fits this description.' He added that the post was 'obviously offensive and ridiculous.' Festival: The picture, taken at the Bismarck restaurant, pictured, was posted before the annual Pow Wow festival, which brings hundreds of Native Americans to the area . Viral: The racially charged post went viral and made its way to the restaurant's Facebook page . Wright told the Bismarck Tribune that Casson had privately apologized to him for her 'mistake.' He said he found out about the post when customers began calling the restaurant to complain, and the photo was reposted on the restaurant's Facebook page. Some people even cancelled catering orders. Casson denied creating the cardboard sign she holds in the picture, but she doesn't deny posing for the picture. 'One of my friends that worked there as well came to visit, and she asked me to hold this poster up, so she could send a Snapchat,' Casson told KMOT 10. Mistake: Casson, pictured, apologized for her poor judgement on local TV . But it was posted on Facebook as well as Snapchat - a photo sharing app where pictures are meant to disappear after they've been received. She added to KMOT: 'People are just assuming it was me who made the sign. Not that it really matters because, I mean, she asked me to hold it up and I did. I could have said no. But I take full responsibility. It was something I chose to do.' Since the picture was posted, Casson has received several threats, according to the TV station, and the Bismarck Police Department has even called to do a welfare check.","The post included a photo of Andrea Casson, a worker at Famous Dave's in Bismarck, North Dakota .

"Charged: Yadina Morales is accused of manslaughter after her baby suffocated . A drunk mother killed her two-month-old daughter at her Maryland home on Saturday morning after passing out while breastfeeding. When the baby's father, Dwayne Bryant, tried to wake his girlfriend, Yadina Morales, he found the lifeless body of his daughter trapped under her. The 22-year-old woman, who has been charged with manslaughter, . was apparently so drunk she didn't even realize her child had been rushed to hospital, police said. 'We found that the mother was highly . intoxicated and had actually been breastfeeding the child and passed out . and ultimately smothered the child,' Sheriff Douglas Mullendore told NBC Washington.

A blood test found Morales, who has two other children, was three times over the legal drink-drive limit. Her boyfriend told police she had been drinking vodka just before the baby started crying. Nursing mothers are advised to not drink while breastfeeding because the level of alcohol in breast milk and the mother's blood is the same.

"Crackdown: Education Secretary Michael Gove said he is looking at hate speech laws in an attempt to stamp out the use of the word 'gay' as an insult . Education Secretary Michael Gove yesterday declared war on the ‘utterly outrageous and medieval’ use of the word ‘gay’ as an insult. He will study current laws to ensure they are ‘properly policed’ and could even ‘sharpen’ them in a bid to stamp out offensive homophobic language. Mr Gove told a conference held by pressure group Stonewall that the Coalition was determined to protect gay pupils from being subjected to homophobic bullying at school. He said that it was unacceptable to use the word ‘gay’ as abuse and named and shamed former Radio One Breakfast Show DJ Chris Moyles. Mr Moyles was branded Stonewall’s ‘Bully of the Year’ at their annual awards ceremony in 2006 after he dismissed a ringtone, saying: ‘I don’t want that one, it’s gay.’ Hate speech laws in the UK are found in several statutes. Expressions of hatred towards someone on account of that person’s colour, race, nationality, religion or sexual orientation is forbidden. Famously, Sam Brown, a 21-year-old student, was taken to court in 2006 for calling a policeman’s horse ‘gay’ after being arrested under section five of the Public Order Act. His remarks were deemed likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress by police, but the prosecution dropped the case at Oxford magistrates’ court. Pop singer Will Young yesterday highlighted the ‘subconscious’ use of the word ‘gay’ and how it was used as a ‘negative term’ when he was growing up. He challenged Mr Gove at the London conference about how few people are brought to account in law for using offensive homophobic language. Mr Gove replied: ‘There are laws there to prevent it happening. ‘One thing I will do is talk to Ben (Ben Summerskill, chief executive of Stonewall) and others about how we can make sure that the laws we’ve got at the moment are properly policed and also I’m always open if we need to sharpen the law because it’s not working, I’m always open to that argument.’ In an exchange with the former winner of Pop Idol, the Education Secretary agreed that it was wrong for people to argue that homophobic bullying was ‘less than an issue than bullying based on skin colour or other cultures’. He added: ‘There’s more to be done. I want to work with Stonewall to do it. War of the words: While former Radio One DJ Chris Moyles (left) was singled out for using the word as a dismissive term, singer Will Young (right)  urged Michael Gove to tackle homophobic bullying . ‘But I think one of the things I can do effectively is wherever there’s an opportunity on a public platform to say so, to say that it’s just utterly outrageous and medieval to think that to use the word gay as an insult is somehow acceptable. ‘Whether it’s Chris Moyles or anyone else does it, it’s wrong and they should be called out.’ Mr Gove said that the Coalition agreement had referred to the vital importance of tackling bullying , especially homophobic bullying, in schools. He said this was a recognition that even as ‘prejudice in our society was in many ways receding there were some prejudices that remain remarkably and irrationally stubborn’. One of these was the prejudice sometimes shown to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and to the young in particular. He said: ‘That prejudice would sometimes find its expression in thoughtless words from disc jockeys or in language in playgrounds that wasn’t effectively policed.’ He added: ‘Therefore it was important even as we saw prejudice recede elsewhere to be more vigilant and more determined than ever to deal with this particular prejudice and the effect it had on young people. Offensive: The Education Secretary said that it was wrong for people to argue that homophobic bullying was 'less than an issue than bullying based on skin colour or other cultures' ‘Because if you’re growing up, wrestling with your sexuality, knowing that it will mean your life will perhaps form a different path from the one your parents envisaged, the last thing that you need to feel is that at school, where other people who should be there to care for you and show you what adult life can bring, the last thing you need is any sense that the difficulties with which you’re wrestling and the path on which you wish to embark are in any way either a legitimate subject for humour, ostracism or prejudice. ‘What young people need as they decide for themselves how they’re going to live their lives is support, approval and celebration.’ Russell Hobby, general secretary of NAHT, said last night: ‘We are pleased the Secretary of State has recognised the impact homophobic bullying can have on young people. ‘By combating bullying and making it clear education should be inclusive school leaders can help reinforce the message that there is no place for homophobia in a school or anywhere in society.’","Education Secretary said the homophobic language is 'medieval'

Now in quarantine in St. Louis, the dogs will eventually be given to good homes.

Upgrade: The two pups were flown via-private jet to St Louis after a life on the streets in Sochi . Backes said he and his wife did not originally intend to bring any animals back. They were hoping to create awareness about shelters that have been set up in Sochi to help hundreds of stray dogs that received international media attention. 'She doesn't take 'no' very lightly,' he said. 'So when she saw those two pups and a few more, she said we've gotta do something to get these out of here and tell their story and broaden the awareness of some of the mistreatment of animals -- and just the difference in (how) they treat their companion animals and we treat ours.' Backes and his wife, who have four rescue dogs and two rescue cats in their home and set up their own foundation, Athletes for Animals, last November, received helped from Canadian winger Jeff Carter's girlfriend, Megan Keffer - who posted images of Backes' new dogs on Twitter - and defenseman Drew Doughty's girlfriend, Nicole Arruda, and others. Tough guy: When Backes isn't rescuing puppies from a life on the streets, he can be a bit of a goon . Animal lovers: Backes and his wife, Kelly, started the animal rescue organization Athletes for animals . The 3- to- 4-month-old pups, named Sochi Junior and Sochi Jake, were brought back to the U.S. on an Air Atlas charter to Newark and another flight to St. Louis. 'They fought for their lives every day on the street and now they're laying on our laps in flights across the Atlantic,' Backes said. Approval for their U.S. trip was only granted Saturday when 'there were tears' of joy in Backes' group. The pups slept in carriers on the Sochi-Newark leg and then were taken out on the Newark-St. Louis leg. Change of plans: The couple initially just planned to spread awareness about animal shelters in Sochi but ended up with two new pets . 'It's like a baby sleeping,' Backes said. 'Don't disturb them when they're resting. It was a very peaceful flight.' The two male 'purebred mutts' befriended the Backeses and others while hanging around and looking for scraps at a resort where players and their families stayed. Soon, said Backes, they were getting bathed in a hotel tub and sleeping in its rooms. 'Once you hang around with a little pup that long, they grow on you and you try and do everything you can for them,' he said.","David Backes and his wife wanted to create awareness about shelters setup for strays in Sochi .

Stern asked if Rudd was a still a member of AC/DC as a result of the charges. 'We've got to resolve that,' Young said. Young said he fell out of bed when he heard the AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd (pictured) had been charged with hiring a hitman earlier this month . Johnson said he was getting ready to fly home to the States and had a cup of coffee in his hand when he saw the news on TV . Johnson suggested Rudd would not be back in the band. 'I don't think we need to do any firing,' he said. 'The situation will take care of itself. He has gotten himself into a pickle. There is nothing we can do about it. We are talking about criminal charges here. We are talking about judges, we are talking about juries. We are going to go on tour. Nothing is going to stop us.' But the pair made it clear that AC/DC would not break up because of Rudd. 'In the past we have had good drummers who have worked with us,' Young said.

"The mother of the small-town girl who had dreams of becoming a Hollywood actress was today driving across the country to be reunited with her daughter after she was found alive following four months of being 'tortured and drugged by a registered sex offender'. Sharon Stratton, from Tennessee, will be reunited with her daughter Satara later today at an undisclosed Los Angeles hospital where she is heavily sedated and being treated for a number of injuries. After frantically searching for her since November, Ms Stratton spoke to the MailOnline about the 'nightmare' she has lived through and the horrific ordeal her daughter endured at the hands of 'monsters'. Alive: Police have located actress Satara Stratton, pictured, who went missing in November. She was believed to be addicted to heroin and under the influence of a sex offender . She said: 'That man destroyed my little girl. He held her captive for more than four . months in a place where she could not escape from. 'He drugged her, . tortured her, attacked her and who knows what else. I'm trying . to get to Satara as fast as I can, I have been driving since 6pm . yesterday. Satara Stratton was said to be a happy fun-loving girl until she moved to Hollywood . 'She needs to be with her family and . we need to get her healthy and back to normal and give her time to . recover from the nightmare she has been through.' She added that when Satara is awake in the hospital, she screams uncontrollably - terrified the man will find her and drag her away. Satara Stratton's disappearance . garnered national attention several weeks ago when it was reported the . pretty 24-year-old had gone from aspiring Hollywood actress to heroin . addict who had been swept up in the city's seedy underworld. A picture of her looking healthy and . happy appeared alongside her drug-ravaged mugshot which highlighted the . shocking transformation she had gone through in just eight months. Los Angeles police announced yesterday she had been located in 'good condition' at an unspecified hospital. Ms Stratton, who is a university professor, said it was the registered sex offender who had kidnapped her daughter who left her at the hospital after increasing pressure . from police. He fled soon after and is thought to be still on the run. Satara, whose screen name was Satara Silver, is now being held in a secure place until he is found. She is being treated for some external injuries and . bruising over her body. She is also suffering withdrawal symptoms from . the drugs she was injected with. Over the last eight months, police . have arrested Satara on several occasions, with her mugshots documenting . how her life had spiraled out of control. Arrests have . included possession of narcotics . in a hospital. Police are now believed to be looking for the sex offender whose offenses are listed as attempted lewd and lascivious conduct with a child under 14 and attempted forced oral copulation with a minor under 14. Hometown: Before moving to Los Angeles, Satara lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where her mother is a professor of anthropology at the University of Tennessee, pictured . Her mother revealed that prior to this, Satara was a normal, happy and quiet young girl who loved dancing and soccer. She had been acting since she was three-years-old and enjoyed early success in a handful of films, including a horror flick called Cult Movie. It was when she was working in New York that she was advised to move to LA as she had dreams of also becoming a film director. Determined to make a success of her . new life, the petite blonde began taking classes and started a job . at the Disney Store on Santa Monica Boulevard. But . it was short lived, as she was robbed outside a bank and hospitalised, . causing her to miss a semester of school, her mother told the Los . Angeles Times last month. She added that her daughter's troubles worsened when a fellow employee began extorting money from her and harassing her. Career: Satara (right) has appeared in several films, including the 2010 movie Fairer Blood, pictured . Speaking today, Ms Stratton said she believes the employee may have been working with the sex offender as the two were friends. 'I don't know what their motive was or . if it was a money thing,' she said. 'But my daughter is very petite and . young looking and I believe one of the men is a registered pedophile, so . perhaps that was why he went after her. 'She was very vulnerable. They singled . her out and preyed on her. My daughter never touched hard drugs in her . life. She was always a very demure and quiet girl.' The university professor said she is just glad Satara is still alive after a threatening email was sent to Satara's boyfriend last month saying he was going to kill both her and her mother. 'I spent two weeks in LA looking for . her after that. I got no help from police who warned me victims aren't . usually found alive after three months missing,' she said. 'It was only when I made a plea on . Facebook and then the media got hold of it that the police really . started to investigate her disappearance.' Sightings: Stratton, who appeared in a handful of films, was seen 6500 block of Santa Monica Boulevard . Job: Satara was working at a Hollywood Disney Store when she was robbed outside a bank and hospitalised, missing a term of school. Her mother said that is where her problems began . Police had considered her 'voluntarily missing' - but her mother refused to believe it, saying that Satara was always in touch regularly. The . last time Sharon spoke to her daughter before she was located was in . November to arrange for Satara to see her grandmother before she died. Satara’s grandmother, with whom she was close, died in January and 'she would never have missed that', Sharon told the LA Times. Though Ms Stratton doesn't know the full details of what her daughter went through, she believes her daughter was stalked before being 'grabbed' after being offered a ride home. It will likely be a while before her daughter can even talk about what happened, she said. 'I want to get my daughter back and . give her the love and care she needs. The last four months have been a . nightmare, I haven't been able to sleep or eat or work or even think. 'Once she is back to normal, I know . Satara will go back to pursuing her dream. She will not give that up . just because of what that man did to her. Downfall: Police mug shots from drug charges show Stratton looking increasingly disheveled and ill . She later posted a message calling for help on Facebook, writing that her daughter 'has health issues risk to life, and previous torture by this man lead to suicidal ideas, and he forced drugs'. Authorities have never divulged the nature of her health issues. On her Facebook page, the concerned mother wrote: 'Satara is not voluntarily missing; she has had no contact with not only family but friends throughout this occurrence.' She added: 'On the surface, she’s an adult and can do whatever she wants. 'But you start digging below the surface and you find these connections and you can’t ignore these connections. So where is she?' Hunt: Satara was noted as 'voluntarily missing' but her mother disputes this, saying they spoke every day .","Satara Stratton, 24, moved to Los Angeles to pursue her dream .

"A woman was so badly beaten while out hiking that her husband couldn't recognise her. Tina Waddell, 42, was walking the Silver Comet Trail in Paulding, Georgia, on Tuesday when she subjected to a brutal and unprovoked attack. She was ambushed on a bridge over Academy Drive near the Chamber of Commerce Trail Head, having covered nearly 20 miles of the walk. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Tina Waddell (left) was hiking on her favourite country path when for no apparent reason she was attacked and beaten so badly that her husband could not recognise her (right) Mrs Waddell moved from Arkansas to Georgia and used the Silver Comet Trail every day. Yesterday the local police still had no leads on either a suspect or motive for the senseless attack, reported Fox Carolina. Mrs Waddell is due to undergo the first of several reconstructive surgeries today as her husband, Jim, said: 'When I first saw her … the emotions came out because that's not my wife. 'They warned me before I saw her that there was a lot of swelling, and when I went in there, I just broke down. I've cried the last two days. I don't think I have any tears left inside of me. 'She has a lot of broken bones in her face. Her nose is broke. They're going to have to wire her jaw shut, and that's going to be six to eight weeks.' Mrs Waddell was alone at the 19½ mile marker when her attacker jumped out. 'She just said she was running and she said that he came at her from the front and that was all she remembered,' said Mr Waddell. The Silver Comet Trail in Paulding, Geoirgia where Mrs Waddell was attacked on Tuesday . According to police reports, during the attack Mrs Waddell slipped in and out of consciousness. After the assault the attacker dragged Mrs Waddell into the woods where he left her. As Mrs Waddell regained consciousness she managed to drag herself on to the trail where she was seen by Peter Skott who immediately rang 911. Of seeing Mrs Waddell, he said: 'I'm not going to forget that image for a long time.' 'Thank God for a great man who happened to call 911 when he found her,' said Mr Waddell. Shortly after being taken to hospital, Mrs Waddell gave the police a vague description of her assailant but since has blocked it all from her mind, according to her husband, and now remembers nothing of the attack. 'I don't know. Could he'd been on drugs? Was [sex] that he wanted and just didn't get it?' asked Mr Waddell. The police do not believe that Mrs Waddell was sexually assaulted. 'Tina fought for her life. This guy's got injuries, somebody out there has to know something,' said Joe Waddell, the victim's brother-in-law. 'I'm a fireman and I've seen a lot of things, but I was not prepared to see when I walked in that hospital room.'

"Newly released email exchanges between police brass show that the Missouri State Police captain placed in charge of security in Ferguson after Michael Brown's killing was both vilified and praised for attempting to replace authorities' militarized approach with one more sympathetic to protesters. The emails, obtained by The Associated Press through an open-records request, also show that police tried to find a way to protect members of the clergy who were in the protest crowds, and that some officers objected to an order to take their meals in public. The messages offer a small window into the inner workings of Missouri law-enforcement agencies as they tried to quell the tensions that arose following the fatal shooting of the black 18-year-old by white police officer Darren Wilson. Scroll down for videos . Polarizing figure: Emails sent to top public-safety officials both criticized and praised Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, center right, for appearing to sympathize with protesters . Calm before the storm: Protesters in Ferguson are waiting for a grand jury to decide whether or not to charge Officer Darren Wilson (left) in connection to the August killing of Michael Brown (right) The records also vividly illustrate one of the many challenges authorities could face if new protests develop — how to walk a fine line between providing public empathy and security. There is no specific date for a grand jury decision to be announced on whether to charge Wilson. But anticipation has been mounting because St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch has said previously that he expects a decision by mid-to-late November. As early as Labor Day weekend, police were already discussing the need to develop a well-coordinated plan for a potential surge in protests when the grand jury decision is announced. Brown, who was unarmed, was shot after a confrontation with Wilson, who had ordered the 18-year-old and a friend to stop walking down the center of a street. Officer Wilson has told authorities that he realized after initially encountering Brown that he matched the description of a suspect in a convenience store robbery that occurred just minutes earlier, according to reports in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that cited unnamed sources. The shooting stirred long-simmering racial tensions in the predominantly black St. Louis suburb where the police force is composed almost entirely of white officers. After a night of riots and looting, police in subsequent days approached protesters in armored vehicles and used tear gas after some demonstrators threw rocks or Molotov cocktails. Capt. Ron Johnson, of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is black, was put in charge by Gov. Jay Nixon to try to restore calm. Unrest: Protesters march in front of police outside the Ferguson Police Department in Ferguson Wednesday .

FERGUSON, MO - NOVEMBER 10:  Ferguson residents listen to speakers during a city council meeting on November 10, 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri. The St. Louis suburb is hoping to avoid a repeat of rioting which broke out after teenager Michael Brown was killed by Darren Wilson, a Ferguson police officer, if the grand jury investigating the shooting does not find justification to prosecute Wilson.  The grand jurys decision is expected sometime in November.  (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) He talked and marched with protesters, posed with them for photos and spoke to loud applause at a rally where he apologized to Brown's family and described his relationship with his own son who wears sagging pants and has tattoos. Johnson and his supervisors received numerous emails and phone calls complimenting his demeanor from law officers across Missouri and the country. 'Your agency and Captain Johnson are making Troopers all over the country proud,' Minnesota State Patrol Lt. Col. Matt Langer wrote to Missouri State Highway Patrol Col. Ron Replogle. But other current and retired law enforcement officers sharply criticized the highway patrol, asserting that Johnson's apology and actions implied Wilson was guilty of a crime without the benefit of a trial. 'The actions of Cpt. Johnson have infuriated me,' retired patrol officer Mike Watson wrote to Replogle. 'He has single-handedly destroyed the reputation of the Missouri State Highway Patrol.' The emails show that patrol officers occasionally took personal steps to try to ease tensions or problems. Johnson, for example, received an email from a woman who lived in the apartment complex near where Brown was shot. She complained that she was having difficulty going back and forth to her job because of protests and police blockades. Johnson told her the problem would be corrected within that week. One officer, acknowledging he was going outside the chain of command, pleaded in an email to supervisors to tell rank-and-file officers that clergy intermingling among protesters were trying to help and should be treated accordingly. Capt. Ron Johnson,  of the Missouri Highway Patrol (pictured from behind), was put in charge by Gov. Jay Nixon to try to restore calm . Accusations: Current and retired law enforcement officers sharply criticized Johnson (left), saying his apology to protesters implied Wilson was guilty . Standoffish: Emails show that officers were opposed to an order requiring them to patronize Ferguson businesses at lunchtime . He suggested pastors could wear brightly colored T-shirts with the word 'CLERGY' on front and back. Replogle, the highway patrol's top officer, responded by offering to pay for the shirts himself, if necessary. At other times, officers appeared to bristle at some of the expectations for interacting with residents. In late August, a lieutenant for the highway patrol sent an email to officers in the St. Louis region detailing their shifts for patrolling Ferguson, with a requirement 'to be seen by the public.' 'When eating meals, troopers must patronize the businesses in the area and not congregate at the Ferguson Police Department,' the lieutenant wrote. Another officer redistributed the email with a note atop, stating: 'The Patrol cannot force you to eat lunch with your own money,' and thanking those who attended a lunch hosted by the wives' of Ferguson police officers. Residents of Ferguson, Missouri, prepared Wednesday for a grand jury report expected soon on the fatal August shooting of an unarmed black teen by a white policeman, an event that laid bare long-simmering racial tensions in the St. Louis suburb. The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown sparked weeks of sometimes violent protests. Many businesses have boarded up their windows as they expect another wave of demonstrations to follow the grand jury's decision, particularly if officer Darren Wilson is not charged. More than two-thirds of the residents of Ferguson are black, but its mayor, police chief and most of its police department are white. Black residents say their conflicts with the police long predate Brown's shooting. A protester in a Guy Fawkes mask stands with his hands in the air in front of police outside the Ferguson Police Department Wednesday . People await the grand jury verdict over the police slaying of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri . In a sign of tensions ahead of the grand jury report, a few dozen protesters gathered outside the city police station late on Wednesday in sub-freezing temperatures faced by officers in riot gear. Some protesters chanted 'Indict that cop.' Police arrested about six people when protesters tried to block the street after ignoring orders to keep it clear. The arrests were the first of protesters in about a week. On Tuesday, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon named a panel of 16 commissioners to develop solutions to the deep-seated socioeconomic disparities in and around Ferguson. Despite the tensions, some in Ferguson have tried to carry on life as usual. A crew of city workers spent Wednesday morning putting up Christmas decorations on the street that is home to the Ferguson Police Department. Activists say that will be the first place demonstrators assemble after the grand jury report. Officials have said the grand jury is expected to make its decision by the end of the month. Show of force: Police in riot gear try to break up protesters marching in the streets . Masked activists block traffic while protesting the shooting of Michael Brown on the eve of the grand jury finding . The Ferguson-Florissant School District told parents on Wednesday that schools may close early or not open at all on the day the grand jury's decision comes, with the decision based on when officials learn the report is coming. Country singer Hunter Hayes, citing the state of emergency declared by the governor, canceled a concert scheduled for Thursday night at an arena on the campus of St. Louis University. Nixon has defended his decision to declare the state of emergency ahead of the grand jury's decision, a move some called heavy-handed, particularly given that protests in recent days had been peaceful. The state of emergency allows the National Guard to deploy to the St. Louis area. St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay asked for 400 National Guard troops to be deployed to his city, to work in alternating 12-hour shifts at 45 locations around the city. There are conflicting accounts of what preceded the Aug. 9 shooting of Brown, with some witnesses contending he had raised his hands in surrender and others describing a struggle between the teen and Wilson.

"Illegal immigrants are paying criminal gangs £1,500 a time to smuggle them out of Britain, it emerged last night. The foreign nationals – many of whom sneaked into the UK undetected in the first place – are put in the back of lorries and transported to France. By avoiding contact with the authorities they can travel on to a European destination of their choice, rather than risk being sent back to their homeland thousands of miles away. Asylum seekers in Calais, France, queue for food handouts distributed by local charity workers. It has been claimed foreign nationals are now being put in the back of lorries and transported to France by gangs to avoid contact with the authorities . The trade, which sees gangs paid £1,500 a time, is a trade 'in human cargo of a very different kind to the one the UK Border Agency is used to', say the Panorama team behind the investigation . It is feared that foreign criminals on the run from the police are fleeing in this way. The bizarre trade, exposed by a BBC Panorama investigation to be shown this evening, is an embarrassment for ministers. Critics will say it shows how the Government cannot stop illegal migrants from leaving Britain, let alone entering. Over a year, Panorama made contact with three criminal gangs offering to smuggle illegal immigrants out of the country with no questions asked. Reporter Paul Kenyon secretly recorded the meeting with the fixer of one gang, held in a fast-food restaurant in London. He posed as an immigrant from Moldova who had been working illegally in the UK without a passport or paperwork and who wanted to return home to his sick wife. The fixer, a former Indian police officer called ‘Munga’, said for £1,500 per person the gang would smuggle groups of three or four illegal immigrants across the Channel in the back of a lorry, taking them to Calais train station. Immigration minister Mark Harper said people were being fingerprinted to see if they have entered the European Union in another country . Mr Kenyon told the Daily Mail: ‘This is a trade in human cargo of a very different kind to the one the UK Border Agency is used to. ‘Many people will be astonished – as well as relieved – to learn that illegal immigrants are abandoning the UK in search of work abroad. ‘It suggests that attempts to crack down on failed asylum seekers and overstayers – as well as the downturn in our own economy and subsequent lack of work here – could at last be having an effect. ‘But who is to say that when these people fail to find work abroad, they won’t simply buy their way back to Britain via the very people traffickers they used to leave the country. ‘Once back here, they might then try again to claim asylum, or simply vanish into the “ghost” community.’ Illegal immigrants who are caught by the authorities are offered financial ‘bribes’ if they agree to go home. Officials estimate a forced deportation costs more than £11,000. Mark Harper, the immigration minister, yesterday admitted:  ‘It is possible we don’t catch every single person who tries  to enter the country clandestinely.’ But he added: ‘When we do catch people, we’re increasing the work we do with our European colleagues. We make sure people are fingerprinted so we can check to see if they have entered the European Union in another country. ‘If they have, we can return them back to the country where they first entered.’","Many foreign nationals who sneaked into the UK undetected – are put in the back of lorries and transported to France, it has been claimed .

"With his perfectly tailored pinstripe suits, Reverend Al Sharpton does a good job of concealing the fact that he's millions of dollars in debt to the IRS. Thanks to years of mismanaging personal and company funds, the prominent civil rights activist and his  businesses currently owe a staggering $4.5million in state and federal tax liens, the New York Times reports. While Sharpton told the paper that he is up to date on payment plans for both debts, state officials told the paper that his state taxes have actually gone up $220,000 in recent years. It was also revealed that his non-profit organization, National Action Network, was only able to continue operating for years because it stopped paying federal payroll taxes for a period. All the while, Sharpton has continued to fly first class and rake in a $250,000 salary from the non-profit. Scroll down for video . In debt: The Rev Al Sharpton is $4.5million in debt due to outstanding state and federal tax payments, it was reported. Pictured above speaking at a news conference on Wednesday . Sharpton told the Times that his tax debts were not intentional, and that he is staying on top of payment plans. 'You can say I’m not a great administrator,' he said. 'You can’t say that I’m not committed.' When the story came out, he responded saying it was 'absolutely inaccurate'. 'We have a signed agreement,' he told Fox News of his payment plan. 'And what is in the agreement has been kept. We’ve been up to date. This is the most bogus story in the world.' Sharpton started off his career as a community organizer who became known as a somewhat controversial advocate in the black community, at one point supporting a black teen named Tawana Brawley who claimed a group of white men kidnapped and raped her. Those allegations ended up being false. But more recently he has become a more mainstream figure, advising President Obama on race issues, hosting his own show on MSNBC, and acting as an advocate for the family of police-shooting victim Michael Brown. His new image as a respected figure is now becoming marred by his shady financial past. Civic duty: Sharpton's financial issues trace back to 1993, when he first pleaded guilty to not filing his state income tax return. Pictured above in 1998 . Sharpton now hosts his own MSNBC show and is a personal advisor on civil rights to President Obama. Pictured together in April, above . Sharpton's money problems trace back to 1993 when he pleaded guilty to failing to file his state income tax return. It was later discovered that Raw Talent, the company he filed his salary from National Action Network into, hadn't been paying taxes for years. In 1998, when he said he didn't have enough money to pay a $65,000 settlement for a defamation suit related to the Brawley case, Sharpton was forced to testify about his personal finances and admitted that he sometimes used money from his non-profit to pay for his daughters' private school tuition, though loans to officers are not allowed in such organizations. He also said that nearly all of his possessions, except a watch and ring,  were actually property of his other company Revals Communications. Sharpton currently owes personal federal tax liens of more than $3million and state tax liens of $777,657, according to records. His for-profit companies, Raw Talent and Revals Communications, owe another $717,329 in state and federal tax liens. His non-profit has had similar issues. For years, the group failed to pay travel agencies, hotels and landlords while it footed the bill for Sharpton's numerous campaigns for public office. Late on the rent check? Sharpton's former landlord also sued him twice for not paying rent at his apartment in this Brooklyn building. The first suit came in 2004 for $56,000. Another was filed in 2007 for $42,000 . Most of these debts have been taken up by Sharpton's rich supporters, but  for years it only managed to stay operational by skimping out on payroll taxes. Records show that the non-profit went from underpaying $90,000 in payroll taxes in 2003 to a whopping $1.9million in 2006. While Sharpton did forgo a salary from 2006-2008 and gave the non-profit a boost of funds with a $200,00 no-interest loan, he started taking his $250,000 salary again in 2009 when the organization was still $1.1million in dept to payroll taxes. The U.S. Treasury's inspector general for tax administration recently wrote that such behavior in non-profit organization was 'abusive' and 'potentially criminal'. Sharpton also had financial issues on the personal front, and in 2004 was sued by his landlord and close friend Bishop E Bernard Jordan for not paying $56,000 in rent. Jordan sued Sharpton again in 2007 for $42,000. It's unclear what happened to the suit, as neither have commented on it. Last month, Sharpton held a huge bash for his 60th birthday, which doubled as a fundraiser for his organization. The event raised $1million which Sharpton pledged to put the money towards erasing his debt.

The coastal town of Leogane holds regular events, and the obscure Haitian practice has been likened to cockfighting or dog-fighting. A casual pastime for some rural men, it's a serious business for others looking to pay their children's school fees or even buy a car. The animals’ horns are often sharpened by knives and machetes ahead of each fight in a bid to give the bulls an advantage over their rivals. The bulls' trainers then stomp through crowds of onlookers as they look to drum up bets among the spectators, while the animals dig holes in the dirt as they wait to be let loose from their ropes. Locals say most fights end when one of the bulls retreats, but some have ended with one of the animals - or spectators - being gored . The animals’ horns are often sharpened by knives and machetes ahead of each fight in a bid to give the bulls an advantage . When owners are satisfied with the bets, two bulls are released to charge into a bone-rattling collision. Lunging at one another and digging their hooves into the soil, the 1,700lb animals battle while hundreds of spectators shout and wave money.

"Fisherman in Siberia claim to have found the remains of a 150 million-year-old dinosaur or reptile in a river. Their boat supposedly bumped into the head of the crocodile-like rock, which was apparently confirmed by scientists to be an ancient lizard or even a dinosaur. Others are not convinced, however, with several professors telling MailOnline it looks too good to be true and may be a hoax. Scroll down for video . Fisherman in Siberia claim to have found remarkably intact remains of an ancient lizard (shown). They supposedly found the crocodile-like head while on a fishing trip. And when they sent photos to experts they were told it was likely a lizard or dinosaur from 150 million years ago . The discovery was made by fisherman from the Wild North Fishing Club were travelling by boat down the Ruta-Ru River in the Yamal Peninsula of northern Russia. Their boat struck something that they initially thought was a boulder, but on closer examination had a somewhat more familiar appearance. Paleontologists are now heading to the river in Siberia to verify the potentially significant discovery. Club chairman Yevgeny Svitov said: ‘It was hard to miss, because the boat driven by my colleague Oleg Yushkov had bumped against it. When he looked to see what it was he found this huge head.’ Several theories have been put forward for what this crocodile-like rock might be. So far experts have suggested the rock is about 150 million years old. The fisherman originally said that Moscow scientists informed them it was a mesosaur, but if the age is correct that would be impossible, as mesosaurs lived from 299 to 270 million years ago. According to Komsomolskaya Pravda it may have been a marine reptile called Dakosaurus-maximus, which lived 161 to 100 million years ago, although more proof will be needed. Other experts speaking to Komsomolskaya Pravda agreed that it was likely a sea lizard rather than a dinosaur. However, speaking to MailOnline several professors and experts in paleontology have expressed their skepticism that the find is genuine, and say it might be a hoax. Dr Mark Evans, Curator of Natural Sciences at Leicester Arts and Museums Service said: 'In this case it does look suspicious, especially in the way it’s poking out of the river bed. 'It’s strange that it’s so much larger than the surrounding cobbles, which would suggest that it hasn’t been transported by the river. 'If it is in its original position, then it should have been eroded away to a greater extent by the cobbles. It is also hard to judge the size of it. It does look rather as if somebody has planted it there. 'Although there is an overall impression of a skull with distinct tooth sockets, some of which have teeth in them, there would seem to be too many tooth positions for it to be Dakosaurus, but that is assuming it is real, and at the moment that is far from certain.' He said that they photographed it and when they got back they emailed the picture to the Zoological Museum of the Institute of Plant and Animal Ecology in the city of Yekaterinburg, Russia. Their scientists came back to them to say that they believed it was the fossilised remains of a lizard that had lived about 150 million years ago, reports The Siberian Times. The Institute's head Pavel Kosintsev said that it was not the first report of fossil discoveries in the region but it was the first photographic evidence that the rumours were 'true'. He said all the indications were that there is possibly a wealth of similar fossils in the area. ‘We have dispatched an expedition there to investigate the remains and secure them for future study,’ he said. ‘At this stage though it's difficult to be precise about exactly what the find shows.’ The institute is confident that the remains have significant scientific value and they are hoping to recover them before the spring thaw washes them away. However, speaking to MailOnline other experts expressed their scepticism that the find was real. ‘If it looks too good to be true, it almost certainly isn’t,’ Dr Tim Palmer of the Paleontological Association tells MailOnline. ‘If it was genuine, old and reworked then it wouldn’t be in the apparently good condition that the picture tries to suggest. Especially in the pebbly and erosive bed of a river. ‘My personal opinion is that someone has buried a stuffed crocodile - or even a large model - in a river bed in order to make some sort of mischief.’ And Dr Ivan Sansom, Senior Lecture in Palaeobiology at Birmingham University, agrees: ‘Finding a fossil skull in the bid of a river is entirely feasible, but it would be a very lucky find to uncover a specimen as intact as illustrated,’ he says. The discovery was made by fisherman from the Wild North Fishing Club were travelling by boat down the Ruta-Ru River in the Yamal peninsula of northern Russia (shown). Their boat struck something that they initially thought was a boulder, but on closer examination had a somewhat more familiar appearance . If true the find may have been a marine reptile called Dakosaurus-maximus (illustration shown). However speaking to MailOnline several professors expressed scepticism that the find was real and say it may be a hoax, with one saying it was 'too good to be true' Dr Richard Butler of the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences at Birmingham University says: 'Without seeing an image of the specimen when it is not almost entirely covered with water it is impossible for me to determine if it is indeed a fossil - it may well turn out simply to be an odd shaped rock. 'What look very superficially like teeth could easily be plants growing on the rock for example! 'At this stage I don¹t think we can say anything about this and its potential scientific significance. I am skeptical as to whether it is even be a fossil.' And Professor of Vertebrate Palaeontology Mike Benton from Bristol University was particularly skeptical of the veracity of the find. 'Well, what can I say. It’s a fake,' he claims. 'It looks a bit like the snout of a crocodile, maybe stuffed, maybe carved in wood, maybe fossil, set up in the pebbles on the bottom of the river and photographed as a student-style prank.' Meanwhile Professor David Martill, a Reader in Palaeobiology from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Portsmouth says: 'The picture of the skull is unclear because of the water running over it, but first impressions suggest it is something with a long snout and pointed teeth. Thus a carnivore. It could be a bear. 'However, there is the possibility that it is is a much older fossil. 'Siberia is rich in Cretaceous strata which might contain any number of fossils reptiles from marine mosasaurs [a type of extinct marine reptile] to terrestrial dinosaurs. But he adds: 'Why on earth the guys didn't haul it out of the water to get a better view is beyond me. Perhaps it is a hoax.'","Fisherman in Siberia claim to have found remarkably intact remains of an ancient lizard .

"A former McDonald's worker who claimed to be falsely accused of putting glass in a cop's Big Mac has received his own whopper of a settlement with New York City paying him $437,000 for his troubles. While Bronx man Albert Garcia's suit against Officer John Florio was dismissed back in 2012, the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, agreed to hear his argument. With that, the unusual settlement was struck. The city settled with the former McDonald's worker Albert Garcia $437,000 for his troubles after cop Florio accused him of putting glass in his Big Mac . 'The settlement was considered to be in the best interest of the parties,' a rep for the city's Law Department told The New York Daily News. Garcia's representatives did not return requests for comment. Florio's lawyer, Richard Kenny, was less reserved. 'Are you kidding me?' he told reporters. It all started when Florio pulled into a Bronx McDonald's drive-thru with his dog partner on a late evening in January, 2005. He said he found some broken glass mixed into the special sauce when he bit down into the patty. Garcia, 18 at the time, was subsequently arrested. 'The settlement was considered to be in the best interest of the parties,' a rep for the city's Law Department told The New York Daily News . Though he confessed to giving Florio something extra in his order, he later recanted. After three weeks in court it took a jury just 30 minutes to clear him, with Garcia's lawyer finding discrepancies in Florio's story. Kenny called the idea his client would cook up the burger story a pack of lies. 'John Florio was as good a man as I’ve ever had the privilege of representing - decent and moral,' he said. Garcia had a civil suit thrown out several months later by a Bronx judge. Florio filed his own suit against the McDonald's which was settled for $15,000 in 2009.","While Bronx man Albert Garcia's suit against Officer John Florio was dismissed back in 2012, the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, agreed to hear his argument .

"Traditional seating on planes could soon be a thing of the past, after a design company unveiled a futuristic new concept.

London-based firm factorydesign have created a prototype model called Air Lair which features single seat ‘cocoons’ stacked on top of one another . The new design features a movable seat that can be positioned to lie flat or sit upright. In addition, each pod has changeable mood lighting on the ceiling, a projector that can screen films onto a small overhead screen and individual iPod docks. It means passengers are able to watch films lying on their backs. Although there are currently no plans to install the design in any aircraft, Factorydesign's Director Adam White said that the concept would appeal to single travellers who did not want to interact with other passengers. The ‘double-decker’ formation of the seats means that passengers get 30 percent more room that they would in traditional aircraft seats .

"In a bid to reinvigorate its flagging economy France is to loosen its strict retail regulations, keeping shops open seven days a week. The country's regimented rules on Sunday trading are rooted firmly in the tradition of keeping Sunday as a rest day for workers, since a law on the matter was decreed in 1906. In 2009, the rules were relaxed a little, and there are exceptions in some tourist destinations such as Paris and the south of France, but many shops are still shut on Sundays. Scroll down for video . Paris' Galeries Lafayette, an upmarket department store, is closed on Sundays . Sorry, we're closed: France has a long tradition of Sunday being a rest day, which many  want to maintain . It is hoped that permitting shops to open on Sundays will allow Paris to match London's reputation for shopping culture. A draft bill, which was leaked to the French press this week, featured plans to deregulate the protected legal trade, a move to unveiled next month. Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron, a 36-year old ex-banker, said: 'We must allow those who wish to work on Sundays to do so, as long as they are suitably compensated in terms of wages and rest, because they want this extra work.' Seven-day shopping: London is famous for its shopping, and France believes Paris can match that . The bill would propose that shops can open on 12 Sundays a year from five currently, with added flexibility for those located in big train stations and tourist areas 'of international stature'. The current rules are seen by many as old-fashioned, and some believe that extended trading hours will help create jobs and fight competition from internet shopping. But many French people are protective over their day of rest, including President Francois Hollande's Socialist majority in parliament. The issue has led to protests and trials, with unions insisting it will hurt workers' rights and small shopkeepers worried that they will not be able to compete against the major chains. The mayor of Paris,  Anne Hidalgo, said the change in law will kill off small shops in the city centre - a 'key factor of the capital's economic dynamism and attractiveness'.","Country's regimented trading rules  rooted firmly in the tradition of rest day .

"A chip shop boss has insisted he’s not racist after putting up a banner boasting that the business now had 'English owners'. Paul Bradbury insists customers 'want to know they are going to be served by somebody English' - even though the shop had previously been run by English people of east Asian descent and of Greek descent. He and his wife Rachel took over the Chippy On The Green, in Hapton Road, Padiham, Lancashire less than a fortnight ago. Furore: Paul Bradbury outside his fish and chip shop, where he has put up a banner boasting that the business now had 'English owners', sparking anger . But the couple have already provoked a furious row with a banner across the front of the shop that reads: ‘Under new management with English owners’. Burnley’s Lib Dem MP Gordon Birtwistle and the mayor of Padiham have both issued demands for it to be removed. But defiant Mr Bradbury has no plans to take it down. He said: 'I’m not racist. Anyone who thinks I’m a bigot is narrow-minded. 'People want to know they are going to be served by somebody English. People have said to us that they are glad somebody English is serving them and that the sign made them want to come in. 'They’ve never had anyone in the shop before. We are advertising that we are English. 'You wouldn’t want your fish and chips served to you by someone Turkish, or from wherever, because it wouldn’t be as good a recipe as it would be from somebody English. 'It doesn’t matter what colour or race you are, we’ll serve you. We welcome everyone here. I won’t be taking the sign down. 'We don’t want to upset anyone and we aren’t racist. We wouldn’t be serving foreign food if we were racist.' Burnley's Lib Dem MP Gordon Birtwistle and the mayor of Padiham have both issued demands for it to be removed . The shop, which sells traditional English takeaways alongside Chinese food, kebabs and pizza, re-opened on Tuesday. Gordon Birtwistle MP said: 'I would rather it didn’t say what it did. It would be better if it said ""serving good quality food to the community"". If it is causing consternation to people, it should either be taken down or changed.' Mayor of Padiham, Coun Vincent Pridden said: 'I don’t think it’s a very positive message to be putting out in the community. If it’s causing upset, the council should look into it.' Gary Curson, a teacher at West Craven . High School in Barnoldswick who lives near the shop, said he would not . set foot in the takeaway again. He said racism was ‘alive and well in Padiham’. He . said: 'We’ve used that chip shop when it was run by other people, who . were well liked and respected in the community. I wouldn’t go in there . now and neither would many of the people I know. 'Half a dozen local people I’ve spoken to since yesterday have said they are disgusted by what it says. 'In this day and age, it shouldn’t matter who you are being served by. 'It’s . not a positive message to put out to children which go to local schools . that you should prefer to go into a shop run by one sort of people. It’s not good for them or for the community. 'Burnley . is supposed to be an enterprising, multi-cultural place. Asian people . run the shop just down the road. This gives a very bad impression of the . area and could well upset people.'

"An Indian pilot is being probed after pictures turned up on social media sites showing him using his cockpit to allow pals to get 'selfie' images. The scandal, which breaches all guidelines for pilots was exposed after pilot Sahil Arora, 34, uploaded the pictures on his Facebook page. In one of the photographs, Arora can be seen posing with crew members for a selfie, in another he is seen with a female friend as an elderly gentleman occupies the pilot's seat. Pilot Sahil Arora couldn't resist a photograph on board his plane with rapper Honey Singh . Not content with just getting a music star to pose, Mr Arora then snapped himself with actor Shah Rukh Khan . He has defended himself against allegations that he breached guidelines, by saying that most of the photos were shot before the plane had taken off. But according to insiders the pilot's foolish move in uploading the pictures onto social media sites actually only exposed what was effectively the tip of the iceberg, and they said that many pilots were doing the same irresponsible behaviour and risking the lives of their passengers. The pilot, who is temporarily grounded, works for Jet Airways, a major Indian airline based in the western city of Mumbai. Mr Arora with some friends - regulations do not permit unauthorised access into the cockpit at any time . A spokesman for the DGCA has described the leaked photographs as a 'very serious issue' Guidelines issued by the Director General of Civil Aviation's (DGCA) state clearly that only a certain number of specified people are allowed inside the cockpit. That means either the pilot, a DGCA inspecting official, an engineer of the airline or trainee pilot and nobody else. But the selfie-obsessed pilot's images show him not only with pals but also with Indian celebrities such as the rapper Honey Singh and actor Shah Rukh Khan. A spokesman for the DGCA said: 'It is a very serious issue. He clearly compromised security guidelines. This is totally irresponsible behaviour by a qualified and highly trained pilot, who permitted unauthorised persons to have a bizarre photo shoot inside the cockpit. It seems Mr Arora enjoys his picture being taken, especially when there's aircraft involved . Mr Arora is a keen fan of the selfie - but he took it one step further aboard a Jet Airways plane . Many would see this as somewhat of a show-off pic - but his latest offerings have flouted all the rules . 'We will serve a show cause notice to Jet Airways and if it is found that there has been a violation of security rules, DGCA may cancel the pilot's licence. 'Recently, the DGCA suspended the flying licence of four pilots who allowed their family members inside the cockpit mid-air. The pilot of a third flight, who allowed passengers inside the cockpit of a plane on the verge of take-off, was taken off flying duties. MailOnline Travel has contacted Jet Airways, and is awaiting comment.","Sahil Arora pictured with friends and well-known stars in plane's cockpit .

"A retired textile worker has spent the past 30 years building a sprawling enchanted maze in the forests of Spain. Josep Pujiula, 77, began crafting his colossal labyrinth on the banks of the Fluvià river in Catalonia in 1980 and continues to add to its network of tunnels, towers and intriguing sculptures. The maze, which recalls Guillermo del Toro's 2006 Spanish fantasy film Pan's Labyrinth, has half a kilometre of walkways and is constructed from rustic materials like wooden planks and sticks bound with rope. Two giant wooden towers stand at the top of the hill; a retired textile worker has spent the past 30 years building a sprawling enchanted maze . Three tunnel entrances that lead into the winding wooden maze; Josep Pujiula, 77, began crafting his colossal labyrinth on the banks of the Fluvià river in Catalonia in 1980 . A bizarre sculpture found at the end of a wooden tunnel, and right, two wooden cabins protrude from the side of the hill . Travel photographer Alastair Philip Wiper, 34, sought out the labyrinth while travelling through Catalonia. He said: 'Whenever I travel I always keep an eye out for new adventures. I had seen the Labyrinth online and realised that I would pass it on my way to Barcelona. 'The woods were so thick you couldn't see the labyrinth at first, but then the structures appeared out of nowhere, towering above the tree line. 'The first thing you see is a long wooden tunnel made of bent and bound sticks, shooting violently up the side of a steep hill. To get to the top of the labyrinth you have to get inside the tunnel and climb your way to the top. You have to be pretty fit to make it up there.' Mr Wiper said he had to watch his step as he made his way up the hillside. He said: 'It felt pretty dangerous. Every time I stepped on a new rung of the ladder in the tunnel I could picture it breaking.' The wooden maze clings to the side of a steep sandy hill, and right, rusting and moss covered sculptures found in the heart of the labyrinth . A birdseye view of the complex wooden tunnels; Pujiula continues to add to its network of tunnels, towers and intriguing sculptures . The inside of the complex wooden maze; the site recalls Guillermo del Toro's 2006 Spanish fantasy film Pan's Labyrinth . Mr Wiper was greeted by several wooden towers which stretched 98 feet into the air. He said: 'Each tower contained a room filled with bizarre sculptures made of odd materials like dolls heads on sticks and old television sets. It was almost like he had been practicing voodoo in there.' Mr Wiper spent two hours inside the labyrinth taking detailed photos of Mr Pujiula's work although sadly did not meet the man himself. Mr Wiper said: 'I didn't see him but apparently he is there most of the time continuing to build. It's not advertised as a tourist attraction, but I've been told he is happy for people to come and visit.'

The structure was originally one and a half kilometers long but was dismantled in 2002 after the Spanish government, who had frequently voiced their objection to the labyrinth, demolished it to provide space for a motorway. Mr Pujiula defiantly built a new structure alongside the motorway and continues to expand his creation while butting heads with the Spanish authorities. Mr Wiper said: 'The motorway runs parallel to the structure so it's probably not as peaceful as it once was. I'm not sure why he decided to rebuild but I got the impression it is something he has to do. 'I love his attitude. When someone is obsessed by an idea and they aren't going to let anything get in their way.'","Josep Pujiula, 77, began crafting his colossal labyrinth on the banks of the Fluvià river in Catalonia in 1980 .

"A Romanian lawyer is suing his local Orthodox bishop and four priests claiming they failed to properly exorcise flatulent demons that were forcing him out of his home. Madalin Ciculescu, 34, accused the five of fraud after they turned up several times to exercise the demons which were responsible for the bad smells that were ruining his business. He claimed that after the failed exorcism the demons even started haunting him at his home at Pitesti in Arges County in central Romania. Romanian lawyer, Madalin Ciculescu, 34, left, is suing his local Orthodox bishop, Constantin Argatu, right, and four priests claiming they failed to properly exorcise flatulent demons that were forcing him out of his home . The case alleging 'religious malpractice' is reportedly the first time there has been such an allegation made in a Romanian court. The four priests had all tried and failed to exorcise the demons, according to the legal papers that named bishop Constantin Argatu, even though he had not been to the property, as he was in charge of the priests who had been there. The case has already been rejected by a lower court in Romania and was rejected again this week by the Romanian High Court, but now the businessmen says he plans to go to the European Court of Human Rights. Unusual case: The court room wall showing the appeal against the earlier ruling . He told the court: 'If they (the accused) represent the way of God then God's ways are crooked. They did not remove the demons that made these bad smells as they promised to do, and I still see all sorts of demons in the form of animals, usually crows but also other such things, that are making my life miserable. 'When I am at home they switch the TV on and off all the time, they make foul smells that give me headaches and basically roam unhindered around my house and my business.' Eerie: The man claimed the demons turned his television on and off and said his hair-dryer was possessed . The man produced his mother to back up his claim saying that even the hair-dryer was possessed and a black shadow came out of it when anyone tried to use it - and she also said the fridge was infested by the flatulent demons that she confirmed left foul smells about the property. But the lawyer for the Archdiocese from Arges, Anton Alin, rejected the allegation of fraud saying that the exorcism had been properly carried out and they believed the allegations of further demons and more bad smells were simply a product of the man's imagination. The Romanian court agreed with the church and rejected the application against Bishop Argatu as well as priests Ionut Cret Ovidiu, Gheorghe Nicut, Marius Dumitrescu and Gheorghe Dunitru - and ordered Ciculescu to pay legal costs.","Madalin Ciculescu, 34, has accused the five .

"Colonel Richard Kemp, who led UK forces in Afghanistan, claimed allowing women into battle would 'put lives in danger' Women lack the 'killer instinct' to serve in frontline combat operations, a retired British army commander has warned. Colonel Richard Kemp, who led UK forces in Afghanistan, claimed allowing women into battle would 'put lives in danger'. Ministers are expected to announce they are ready to lift the long-standing ban within weeks, but critics say it risks damaging the fighting capabilities of the armed forces. In May this year Philip Hammond, then the Defence Secretary, said it was time for the Armed Forces to abandon the 'macho' image and show they were open to everyone who was fit enough. He said the US, Canadian and Australian armies allowed women to serve in combat roles – and so should Britain. He ordered a review into who can take combat roles, which is expected to report shortly. But Mr Kemp accused Mr Hammond – who is now Foreign Secretary – of pursuing a 'transparent political agenda'. Writing in The Times, he said: 'Prioritising political correctness and a misguided idea of equal opportunities can only serve to undermine fighting effectiveness and put lives in danger.' He said it was the machismo in the forces which Mr Hammond 'seems to despise so much' which was needed when troops must make the decision to 'kill or be killed'. 'Infantry close combat demands ferocity, aggression and killer instinct. These characteristics are far more common in men than women,' he said. 'Even in the high-tech 21st century, 100 years after the outbreak of the First World War, the infantry soldier's ultimate purpose is still to get out of a trench and charge into the teeth of enemy fire: to close with the enemy and kill him face to face with bullets, bayonets, grenades and if necessary in hand-to-hand combat.' He questioned how many women would take up the chance to transfer to frontline combat roles in the infantry. 'Physically and emotionally, few women will have the aptitude to join the combat arms and perhaps even fewer will want to do so,' he added. Philip Hammond, then the Defence Secretary, said it was time for the Armed Forces to abandon the 'macho' image and show they were open to everyone who was fit enough . Jo Dyer, 24, left, a friend of Prince William, was killed by a roadside bomb in Basra in 2007 and right, medic Sarah Bryant was killed in Afghanistan in 2008 . Women can find themselves on the frontline and extremely close to the enemy while serving as medics, intelligence specialists, artillery spotters, logisticians or signallers. However, they remain barred from all infantry battalions and Royal Marine Commando units – including Special Forces – and from tank regiments and other armoured units. Theoretically, women would be allowed to join the Special Forces, such as the SAS. But to do so they would be expected to pass the unit's gruelling mental and physical selection process. The Ministry of Defence stressed that the final review has not yet been completed. A spokesman said: 'The review process into women in combat roles is ongoing: no decisions have been made and so any suggestion to the contrary is inaccurate. As such, it would be wrong for the department to comment further at this stage.'","Richard Kemp claims putting women into battle would 'put lives in danger'

"A pair of high school footballers in Connecticut have been charged with sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl, just days after two star players in Steubenville, Ohio, were convicted of rape in a case that shook the nation. Torrington High School football players Edgar Gonzalez and Joan Toribio, both 18, are accused of felony second-degree sexual assault and other crimes in an investigation that began last month. Both have pleaded not guilty. Since the alleged abuse, the young victim, who hasn't been named, has been taunted on social media sites by dozens of classmates who are upset at the claims against the football stars. Accused: Torrington High School football players Edgar Gonzalez, pictured left, and Joan Toribio, right. both 18, are accused of felony second-degree sexual assault and other crimes . The victim has been called a 'whore,' criticized for 'snitching' and blamed for 'ruining' the lives of the popular players. One Twitter user wrote: 'Young girls acting like whores there's no punishment for that young boys acting like boys is a sentence.' After The Register Citizen published his tweet, the same user said on Twitter that he 'would tweet the same exact thing about what happened in Ohio, not that the girls aren't victims my point is.' Another bully tweeted: 'Even if it was all his fault, what was a 13-year-old girl doing hanging around 18 year old guys..' The tweet was reposted 11 times and received six favorites. A judge has ordered details of the Connecticut allegations to be sealed from public view. This tends to happen in the state when a case is still under investigation, and when a young victim is involved. The warrants will remain sealed for 15 days at which point a hearing will be held to decide whether the details will be made public, according to the Citizen. Bullying: The victim has been bullied on social media after the allegations against Toribio, pictured, and Gonzalez . Sealed: Details of the allegations against the two friends have been sealed from public view . The case mirrors one in Steubenville, where two football players were convicted this week of raping a girl who was later threatened online. Gonzalez and three other Torrington football players were also embroiled in a hazing scandal last year that is still under investigation, according to the Citizen. Gonzalez, who was named the team's Most Valuable Player, was charged in a March 2012 alleged felony robbery after he and three others allegedly jumped three 14-year-olds in search of money. Jeffrey Holder, 19, a former Torrington High School football player, was also charged but the other two co-conspirators were not identified because of their age. Gonzalez has pleaded not guilty in that case. Former Head Coach Dan Dunaj, who resigned in December, allowed Gonzalez to play in 2012, despite the charges. He told the Citizen he 'reeled the kid in' when he became aware of the pending robbery charges against Gonzalez 'and he walked the line. As a coach I was doing something right.' Bullying: The victim has been called a 'whore,' criticized for 'snitching' and blamed her for 'ruining' the players' lives . Twitter: The 13-year-old has been targeted by dozens of Torrington classmates who are angry about the allegations . Ohio: The case mirrors one in Steubenville, where two football players were convicted this week of raping a girl who was later threatened online . Coach: Athletic Director Mike McKenna said the incidents were not reflective of the culture of the football team . Culture: Both this and the Ohio rape case have raised questions about the football culture in local high schools . Dunaj said, however, that sexual . assault charges are a different matter, insisting he would kick the . 18-year-old off the team if he were still in the role and Gonzalez had . another season ahead of him. 'My . process has always been like this, and I learned this from my high . school coach, and I never got into any big trouble, thank God, but if . you didn't give the kid a chance then who's going to,' Dunaj told the . newspaper.

Director Mike McKenna told the Citizen: 'If you think there's some wild . band of athletes that are wandering around then I think you're . mistaken.' According to McKenna, a student . athlete would be suspended from play for a 'serious infraction.' However, he couldn't say whether a felony or a misdemeanor would be . enough.

Isolated: Torrington athletics director has insisted the incidents are isolated and not indicative of a sordid culture within the football team . Valuable: Edgar Gonzalez, pictured, was voted Most Valuable Player . He told the newspaper that he personally considered a violent felony worthy of a suspension. In Steubenville, head coach Reno Saccoccia may face charges for his failure to report the shocking rape by quarterback Trent Mays, 17, and wide receiver Ma'lik Richmond, 16. He allegedly told the two star players that he'd 'make it go away,' referring to the allegations, rather than telling police. Both cases have raised questions about the football culture in local high schools. A comment on the Citizen's story reads: 'The power of the football team. Be a good athlete and you can do no wrong.' The victim in the Ohio case has been viciously tormented on social media by other teens. Yesterday it emerged that two girls, aged 15 and 16, who are facing charges for allegedly issuing death threats to the girl will stay in custody pending trial to protect the victim.

"Movie buffs are heading to Georgia in their droves to follow in the footsteps of their big screen heroes. With a huge influx of film and television series being made in the U.S. state over the past few years thanks to a lucrative tax credit, a screen tourism boom has followed. Blockbusters made in Atlanta and the surrounding counties that are slated for release in the next year include The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 & 2, Taken 3, Insurgent (sequel to Divergent), and Fast and Furious 7. Hit series The Walking Dead, The Vampire Diaries and Constantine also bring in millions in revenue and employment to the state. Money maker: Blockbusters such as The Hunger Games are responsible for a tourism boost for Georgia . Screen Tourism defines the growing trend for tourists motivated to visit destinations they have seen in films and on television. In the UK, it is estimated that one in 10 visitors are attracted by filming locations they see on screen. Attracted by a tax credit of up to 30 per cent for productions of USD$500,000 or more, film and television crews have flocked to the southern state. 'Georgia has been the backdrop for many high profile productions like The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, The Walking Dead, and Insurgent - all of which have a huge fan following,' says Lee Thomas, deputy commissioner of the Georgia Film, Music & Digital Entertainment Office. 'After filming has wrapped, these iconic movies and television shows will continue to attract fans from all over the world who want to visit the locations from their favorite films and television shows.' According to the Georgia Department of Economic Development, 158 feature film and TV productions have been shot during the 2014 financial year, with a combined production spend of USD$1.4billion. Zombie tours: Fans of hit series such as The Walking Dead flock to the state to visit filming locations . Tour companies specialising in showing fans filming locations for Hunger Games and The Walking Dead do big business. The Hunger Games Unofficial Fan Tour charges USD$100 per ticket to take fans on a tour of Atlanta, including The Goat Farm in West Midtown, which stood in for the coal mining community of District 12 in the films, and The Swan House at the Atlanta History Center, which was used for President Snow's house in Catching Fire. The Atlanta History Center has seen 5,000 people take the Capitol Tour since it began in November of 2013.

The flourish of Golovkin's final blows rocked StubHub Center, which was packed to standing-room-only capacity with fans of the Kazakh-born, California-trained middleweight who has become one of the sport's most charismatic stars. The crowd of 9,323 - easily the largest turnout for a boxing event at the outdoor stadium - chanted 'Triple G!' and leaped to its feet for the stoppage. 'Those cheers were not only for the fighter, but for the person he has shown to be,' said Abel Sanchez, Golovkin's trainer. Golovkin battered Rubio (59-7-1) throughout his 12th title defense, hurting Rubio earlier in the second round with a right hand and a left uppercut. A raucous sellout crowd in the outdoor stadium chanted the name of the Kazakh-born, California-trained middleweight who has become one of boxing's most charismatic stars. 'I felt I hurt him with the left hand, and the uppercut was when he was very badly hurt,' Golovkin said. 'I knew I had him... I was happy he came forward. He fought Mexican style, and he tried to hurt me, but my power was too much for him tonight.' Golovkin won Rubio's WBC interim belt, which means the winner of WBC champion Miguel Cotto's upcoming bout with Canelo Alvarez must either fight Golovkin or vacate the title. Golovkin has trouble attracting the world's biggest 160-pound names, so he hopes to clean out the division by winning every belt. 'He'll fight anyone, whoever we can get in the ring,' promoter Tom Loeffler said. Rubio briefly complained that the knockout punch was illegal, although television replays clearly contradicted him.

'He hit me hard, but it's not the hardest I've been hit. I came to fight, to put on a good show. I got up, but the referee decided to stop it.' Rubio missed weight for the fight on Friday by nearly 2 pounds, costing him the chance to fight for both titles. He entered the ring weighing 181 pounds, but Golovkin floored him with the same relentless style that has been too much for every middleweight opponent to date. Golovkin landed 28 power punches in just over four minutes of ring time against Rubio. Golovkin has trained in Southern California with Abel Sanchez for the past four years, and the Germany-based fighter is contemplating a full-time move to Los Angeles. After starting his U.S. career with five fights on the East Coast, he debuted in California with the Los Angeles Dodgers' logo on his left hip. The fight was a validation of Golovkin's rising status, highlighting his surge to the top of the middleweight division. Golovkin's pro career foundered until he signed with the Klitschko brothers' promotional company in early 2012, but the 32-year-old has been making up for those lost years with a busy schedule and a relentless series of knockouts. Golovkin made his US debut just over two years ago, gathering savvy fans and HBO's promotional might with each spectacular stoppage. 'He's collecting belts,' Loeffler said. 'He wants to show he's a super champion, and 2015 will be a huge year for him.'

Miniature models adorn the bath tubs, ceilings and sink plugs as designers have gone all out in the kitten celebration. Pinks and perfect: Guests can visit the suite to enjoy some quality Hello Kitty time even if the funds don't stretch to an overnight stay . Soaps, scents and even branded toothpaste are left in the bathrooms for Hello Kitty fans to enjoy . A goody bag was left in the rooms for Hello Kitty fans heading to the convention in the city at the start of November . In conjunction with the cute cat's creators - Sanrio - the boutique lodging was redecorated ahead of the first ever Hello Kitty fan convention. One of the most creative additions? The VIP lounge's sweet cake couch, crafted by Vienna-based artist Dejana Kabiljo, from which visitors can take in the incredible LA-skyline views. The VIP lounge is located in room 1219 on the hotel's 12th floor. The restaurant's chef, Roy Choi, who is also the man behind Koreatown's POT restaurant and The Line's Commissary, also created a special spam musubi in homage to the character. The hotel's store, Poketo, is likewise selling Hello Kitty items and there are even themed Linus bikes available for rent in the lobby. The boutique hotel is located in the Koreatown area of Los Angeles and partnered with Hello Kitty makers Sanrio for the rooms .

"The cost to taxpayers of refurbishing the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s Kensington  Palace apartment has quadrupled – to £4million. Building work on the 22-plus room home has soared by £3million in the last year and includes the bill for William and Kate’s new kitchen and several bathrooms, the Mail can reveal. The vast project has seen Apartment 1A, which had been used as office space since the death of Princess Margaret, transformed into a ‘family home’. Scroll down for video . Fantastic: The Cupola room - part of the King's State apartments at Kensington Palace. Renovations of the couple's Palace flat have now reached £4million . Spectacular: The impressive King's Gallery - also part of the State Apartments. The royals will enjoy a new kitchen, several bathrooms and a new nursery for Prince George thanks to the taxpayer . Nation's treasure: London's Kensington Palace and its formal gardens. The royals will move in to Apartment 1A - which has been empty following the death of Princess Margaret . Although the couple are personally paying for all fixtures and fittings like curtains, carpets and furniture, the cost of building their new bedroom and even Prince George’s nursery has come from the public purse. One courtier last night insisted that the Kensington Palace project actually offered taxpayers ‘great value’ given the state of the crumbling apartment. But questions will be asked as to whether Buckingham Palace, which has forked out for the refurbishment, is spending public money wisely. Cuts to the Queen’s funding led to a dramatic battle between courtiers and the previous Government. Senior officials – who admitted at one point that the monarch was down to her last £1million in the bank – accused ministers of leaving them with a £40million backlog of essential work to royal residences. Just a few years ago Princess Anne was almost hit by a piece of falling masonry in the crumbling courtyard at Buckingham Palace, while staff are regularly forced to use buckets to catch the rain from its leaky roof. Not extravagant: The Duke and Duchess with Prince George and dog Lupo at their apartment window . From above: The royal residence - with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's apartment pictured in the foreground. A courtier insisted the renovations were 'great value' given the scale of the project . Move: The royal couple, who used to live in Notthingham Cottage where Prince Harry now resides, have spent millions transforming Princess Margaret's apartment . Following a comprehensive review of royal finances, the Queen now receives a Sovereign Grant to spend as she wishes on her residences and official duties. The sum was £37.9million in 2014-15. The Mail understands that a ‘significant proportion’ of the money set aside for essential repairs and maintenance has been spent on William and Kate’s new home. MPs have already questioned the use of money on private accommodation after discovering that £1million had been spent in 2012/2013. They were due to be told that the bill for Apartment 1A has spiralled to £4million, including VAT, when the Queen’s accounts are laid before Parliament on Wednesday. But after being contacted by the Mail with the figures, Buckingham Palace was forced to reveal details of the full cost. A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess said the Palace is their ‘one and only official residence’, where they will live for ‘many years to come’. But it was last refurbished in 1963 and needed a ‘significant amount of work’ to make it habitable again. He added: ‘The work included significant costs for the removal of asbestos, the installation of a new roof, the complete overhaul of electrics and plumbing and a significant amount of internal building work to return the residence to function as a living space. Facelift: Renovation work is started on the central London building. Following a comprehensive review of royal finances, the Queen now receives a Sovereign Grant to spend as she wishes on her residences and official duties . External work: More renovations are made on the building. A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess said the Palace is their 'one and only official residence', where they will live for 'many years to come' ‘To put it in perspective, there wasn’t even any running water.’ Because the palace is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, the refurbishment had to be of a high standard to meet English Heritage guidelines. In 2012/13 initial internal refurbishments cost £600,000 and the renewal of the apartment’s roof a further £400,000. It was indicated that further costs were to come, but nothing approaching the final bill revealed today. The couple, who also own Anmer Hall, a Norfolk country mansion given to them by the Queen, finally moved into the palace apartment last autumn after more than a year of building work. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, last night said the bill would not go down well with either Parliament or the public. She said: ‘This is money coming out of the public purse at a time of great austerity and I am doubtful whether this is something the public would endorse. Former home: Princess Margaret in her drawing room - which William and Kate will now call home . 'And with so many people of the same age struggling to get on the property ladder, trying to scrape together a minimal deposit, then you would have thought they would show more sensitivity.’ But the spokesman for the couple insisted that they had done everything possible to keep the costs down, adding: ‘The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge paid privately for all the internal furnishing, including carpets and curtains. They were also at pains to ensure that the specification is not extravagant.’ A Buckingham Palace spokesman added: ‘This is a major Royal Household project that is specifically being created, driven and owned by us, not them. It is essential they have a home and this needed to be made into one. ‘The vast majority of these costs have gone on simply trying to make it habitable again.’","Cost of Kensington Palace refurbishment soared by £3million in past year .

"Living it up: Kelly-Louise Goatley, who took exotic holidays while letting her council flat near London's Hyde Park . A benefits cheat made £24,000 by illegally sub-letting the council flat she had been given after she became pregnant aged 18. Kelly-Louise Goatley, who earns £29,000 a year as a secretary at City bank Mizuho International, took trips to Borneo, Australia, Spain and Corfu while she sub-let the property near London’s Hyde Park for more than £1,400 a month. Meanwhile, she paid Westminster Council  as little as £94.72 per week in rent and was working full time. She claimed housing benefit for the flat, even though she was staying with either her boyfriend or her mother. Last week, having previously been found guilty  of fraud, Goatley narrowly escaped a prison term by paying back £10,000 – less than half her illicit profits. If she had failed to pay up, the council had planned to take her back to Southwark Crown Court, where she was previously given a nine-month prison sentence suspended for two years. Goatley was given the one-bedroom flat, meant for the vulnerable, when she became pregnant in 2000, and said she had been thrown out by her family. She lost the baby but continued to live in the apartment in Gloucester Terrace, Paddington. She let it for £1,200 a month between September 2006 and April 2008. A couple from Spain then moved in during 2010 and lived there until February 2011, paying £1,408 monthly. Goatley used a lettings agent and signed a declaration that she was the flat’s owner. But she insisted her tenants not contact the council, telling them she would take care of council tax. She also requested that no ‘to let’ signs be placed outside. When a whistleblower reported her to the council’s fraud hotline, an investigator found the Spanish couple at the flat, who produced a tenancy agreement. Goatley claimed housing benefit for the flat in exclusive Gloucester Terrace, pictured, even though she was staying with either her boyfriend or her mother . Goatley managed to escape paying the full £24,000 she racked up because she no longer had the money. She had first claimed she was penniless, but fraud investigators uncovered a bank account containing almost £11,000. Westminster Council has now repossessed the flat. Goatley refused to comment.","Took trips to Borneo, Australia, Spain and Corfu while sub-letting the property for more than £1,400 a month .

"New hope: 50 young people are diagnosed with MS each week . Thousands of people with MS could benefit from the first pill to treat the disabling disease. The NHS rationing body has approved the drug fingolimod which can halve relapses compared with standard interferon injections. Experts hoped the once-a-day pill will replace injections and hospital infusions for at least 5,000 sufferers a year. In its initial assessment, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) said the drug was not value for money despite admitting it works. But after considering extra evidence on its effectiveness Nice decided to give the go-ahead for use on the NHS. Dr Eli Silber, a consultant neurologist who leads the MS service for South London based at King’s College Hospital, and was involved in trials, said . 'We’ve waited a long time for an effective oral treatment to offer patients who are continuing to relapse on first line injections. 'Today’s decision increases treatment choice. Because it is a highly effective oral agent it may change the way MS is managed in the UK forever. 'With more active forms of MS, we have a limited window of opportunity to make a difference to patients’ lives - many are young people who are raising families and starting their careers. 'I want to get appropriate patients onto this therapy as quickly as possible.' MS is the most common disabling . neurological condition, affecting almost 100,000 Britons - 50 young . people are diagnosed each week. It . involves damage to myelin, a protective sheath surrounding nerve fibres . of the central nervous system which means the body’s immune system . attacks itself. Symptoms . range from mild, occasional illness involving numbness, muscle weakness . and eye problems to rapid and severe deterioration, resulting in . serious disability. On screen portrayal: Actor Martin Sheen played President Josiah Bartlet in The West Wing, who suffered physical disabilities due to MS . Trial results in the New England Journal of Medicine last year showed fingolimod, also known as Gilenya, cut relapse rates and progression of the disease. Patients treated with fingolimod had a 50 per cent cut in disabling relapses compared with commonly used injections of beta interferon. The chances of progressing to a worse form of the disease were cut by about a third, without significant side effects. The new drug appears to dampen the immune response that causes nerve damage in multiple sclerosis. The £19,000 annual cost of the drug compares with the £21,000 annual cost of hospital infusions using Tysabri, and manufacturer Novartis has devised a patient access scheme that cuts the price. MS specialists say the drug could make overall savings for the NHS, because fewer patients would need hospital treatment costing £3,000 a time after relapse and disability is lessened. The draft guidance from Nice means it will be funded by the NHS in England and Wales after final guidance is issued next month. The drug, made by Novartis, was rejected for NHS use by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC). Nick Rijke, Director of Policy & Research at the MS Society, said: 'We are delighted; this decision signifies a major step forward in the treatment of this devastating condition. 'Gilenya has been found to be highly effective in trials and taking a daily tablet will come as welcome relief from frequent, often unpleasant, injections. 'Making this new treatment available will increase patient choice for thousands of people with MS across England and Wales, but we’re deeply disappointed by the SMC’s decision in Scotland - and urge them to reconsider.' Professor Carole Longson, Director of the Health Technology Evaluation Centre at NICE said: 'Following new information provided during the consultation, the analyses show that for these people (with highly active MS), treatment with fingolimod will be a cost effective option for the NHS, if Novartis provides the drug at a discounted price, as proposed in its patient access scheme.'","Multiple Sclerosis is most common disabling neurological condition, affecting almost 100,000 Britons .

"Gemma Wilby, who developed a life threatening wound infection, pictured with her son Alfie . The birth of her first son Alfie in September 2012 should have brought nothing but joy to Gemma Wilby. Instead, it left the 30-year-old barmaid from Caterham in Surrey fighting a life-threatening infection as the wound from her emergency Caesarean became infected with the drug-resistant superbug MRSA. Even though she was given the most powerful antibiotics available, underwent surgery to remove the infected tissue and even had maggot therapy (where the disinfected fly larvae are used to clean the wound), six weeks later nothing had improved. Her doctors said it was one of the worst cases of MRSA infection they had ever seen. 'I thought I was going to die,' recalls Gemma, who lives with her partner and Alfie's father Mark Minick, a 32-year-old chef. 'I was really scared. I was in so much pain and so feverish I couldn't even cuddle Alfie. I felt like a freak, and the wound was so badly infected you could smell it several feet away.' Yet just six weeks later the infection had completely healed. As unlikely as it sounds, Gemma insists that the solution was a pair of pyjamas she bought for £49.99. The pyjamas were made from fabric with fine strands of copper running through it. Copper has a long history as an anti-bacterial agent. In 2,500BC, copper salts were used as wound dressings by the Ancient Egyptians. Roman and Greek sailors used to place a copper coin in their drinking water to prevent it fouling during long voyages. But it is only in the past ten to 15 years, with the rise of drug-resistant superbugs, that copper's antimicrobial properties have attracted renewed attention. There have since been dozens of studies highlighting the extraordinary power of copper to destroy potentially lethal organisms such as MRSA, E.coli and Clostridium difficile. When these bacteria come into contact with copper surfaces, they rapidly self-destruct. It is thought that copper effectively punches holes in the outer membrane of bacteria, viruses and fungi in such a way that the cells implode. This makes it very unlikely that superbugs will learn to become resistant to the treatment. 'When bugs come into contact with a copper surface, they are like a boat that has sprung a leak - the copper floods in and engulfs the organism,' says Professor Bill Keevil, a microbiologist and director of the environmental healthcare unit at Southampton University. Professor Keevil's experiments show that when bugs encounter a copper surface, they are killed off in under 90 minutes. His team placed ten million bacteria on a square centimetre of stainless steel (used for door handles, taps and other fittings in most hospitals), and on pure copper. The results, published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in 2008, showed bacteria survived on the stainless steel for several days. But within 90 minutes, there was no trace of them on the copper.Last year, a study by scientists at the Medical University of South Carolina reported that MRSA infection rates among intensive care patients were more than halved if copper alloy surfaces replaced steel or plastic ones. Another study found that spraying steel fittings with a copper coating virtually eradicated bugs. In the NHS, copper's use has been confined to a handful of hospitals taking part in bug-busting trials - yet these studies all found that copper led to a dramatic reduction in bacteria on surfaces. At the moment, most NHS trusts try to combat superbugs through strict hygiene, mainly involving alcohol-based gels for hands, and chlorine products, such as bleach, for sterilising surfaces. But evidence suggests chlorine provides only short-lived sterility, and corrodes surfaces, allowing bugs to 'hide' in grooves and cracks. Meanwhile, repeated contact with alcohol-based hand gels can lead to dry and cracked skin. Leading microbiologists confess they are baffled and frustrated by the NHS's failure to use copper. 'It's a great shame because the science is absolutely solid,' says Dr Vanya Gant, consultant in microbiology and infection at University College London Hospital. Five years ago, Dr Gant and his colleagues helped to develop a range of gels and handwashes made from liquid copper to tackle hospital superbugs. The rationale was that although copper surfaces work well, they still have to be kept scrupulously clean to kill bacteria - and once a layer of residue builds up, perhaps from alcohol gels used by staff, the copper becomes less effective. 'We took copper and enhanced its antibacterial capacity in liquid form by over a thousand times,' says Dr Gant. 'In trials we took four wards and cleaned them either as normal, using chlorine or detergent, or with copper solution - and found a significant reduction in all known bacteria by cleaning with liquid copper.' Dr Gant then joined forces with a company called Micron Clean to develop microfibre cleaning cloths pre-loaded with copper solution. Six weeks later MRSA had completely healed. Gemma insists that the solution was a pair of pyjamas made from fabric with fine strands of copper . But the NHS trusts they approached preferred to stick with conventional cleaning methods.'So we gave up,' says Dr Gant. 'I am not a businessman.' When it comes to copper surfaces, hospitals often cite expense as a reason not to replace existing fittings, says Dr Tony Worthington, a microbiologist at Aston University in Birmingham. Stainless steel currently trades for between £1,800 and £2,400 a tonne, while copper fetches nearly £4,500. But as Dr Worthington points out: 'We've got stainless steel which doesn't work and copper which does. It's a no-brainer.' The costs of installing copper in hospital wards could be recouped within two months, due to fewer infections and patients leaving hospital sooner, according to a report in June 2013 by the York Health Economics Consortium, which is part of York University.They looked at installing copper in an intensive care unit on surfaces such as bedrails and chairs. But can copper fabrics have the same benefits? 'Yes,' says Professor Keevil. 'When bacteria come into contact with copper in the clothing, it kills them.' Tests suggest that washing the fabric at any temperature doesn't weaken its effect. 'Copper fabrics are now being looked at for wound healing,' adds Professor Keevil. 'Copper stimulates several enzymes that promote healing. It has great potential for things such as diabetic ulcers that won't heal.' Experiments show that when bugs encounter a copper surface, they are killed off in under 90 minutes . Gemma Wilby found her copper pyjamas through a friend who works for the supplier Copper Clothing. Within days of her Caesarean at Croydon University Hospital, it was clear her wound was infected. Two weeks later Gemma was discharged, on high-dose antibiotics, as it was thought she would do better at home. However, her GP sent her back for urgent hospital treatment. Under general anaesthetic, she was given a 'debridement', where rotting flesh is removed. But they couldn't remove all the affected tissue and, as a last resort, Gemma was given maggot therapy. Usually the maggots live for about five days: Gemma's wound was so toxic, they died within a day. In desperation, after a month on antibiotics she turned to the copper pyjamas, which are made from 40 per cent copper-infused yarn and a fabric derived from bamboo. Gemma wore the pyjamas virtually round the clock, and after two weeks she noticed that the wound was gradually shrinking. 'I was very cynical about them at the beginning, and the infection control nurses who came to my house warned it could take a year for the wound to heal properly. 'They were amazed at the speed of my recovery. After a few weeks, when there was no longer any sign of infection, they thought they must have made a mistake.' Croydon University Hospital is now carrying out experiments with copper clothing for staff and bedding for maternity patients. Experts agree that copper fabrics won't help most healthy people. But it may be worth investing in them if you need surgery and fear picking up a hospital infection.","Gemma Wilby, 30, from Caterham in Surrey fought life-threatening MRSA .

"Tough stance: Mark Harper, Conservative MP for Forest of Dean, has said limiting access to free healthcare is key to preventing the NHS becoming an 'international health service' Migrants from Romania and Bulgaria who travel to Britain without a job are to be told they must have private medical insurance to prevent the NHS becoming an ‘international health service’. Immigration minister Mark Harper told the Daily Mail that limiting access to free healthcare is seen as key to preventing a fresh influx of migrants when controls are lifted at the end of this year. He suggested the requirement for medical insurance would apply to all student incomers and those who claim they are ‘self-sufficient’, meaning they are not coming looking immediately for work. Ministers are also examining incomers’ rights to benefits and other public services. Other measures under discussion include requiring migrants to leave Britain if they fail to secure a job after three months – or cannot prove they have sufficient funds to support themselves for at least six months. Transitional arrangements in place since 2005, which restrict the rights of 29million Bulgarian and Romanian citizens to live and work in other EU states, will expire on January 1. No official figure has been put on the anticipated number of arrivals, but Tory MPs warn there must be no repeat of the situation when Poland joined the EU and Labour catastrophically underestimated the numbers that would come. A significant influx of immigrants from the two former Communist regimes could derail the Conservatives’ testing target of reducing net immigration to under 100,000 by 2015. Campaign group MigrationWatch has claimed as many as 250,000 people could arrive in the UK from Romania and Bulgaria over the next five years, though ministers do not believe there will necessarily be an influx of that size since other EU countries are lifting restrictions at the same time. Mr Harper, who is chairing a new cross-Government committee examining measures to deter incomers who would be a burden, said: ‘We are all clear we need an immigration system that works in the national interest. That is why we are bringing together colleagues from other departments to address the pull factors that drive immigration to the UK. ‘European nationals do not have unrestricted access to the UK – they must be exercising their treaty rights. This means they must be working, studying or self-sufficient. We already have tough rules on access to benefits; we need to see if there is more we can do to tighten them up. ‘In addition, EU students and those that are self-sufficient should not be a burden on the host member state, which means they should have things like health insurance. We have a National Health Service, not an international health service.’ It is unclear how the proposals would work in practice but it is likely NHS staff would be asked to check healthcare entitlements when migrants first came into contact with the NHS. Immigration: Transitional arrangements in place since 2005, which restrict the rights of 29million Bulgarian and Romanian citizens to live and work in other EU states, will expire on January 1 . But restrictions on access to free healthcare are likely to run into opposition from some doctors, who resent the idea they should act as another branch of the immigration service. Ministers insist Britain must have the right to address ‘pull factors’ that are blamed for attracting jobless migrants from the EU. Areas being looked at include healthcare, education, housing and benefits. The NHS has written off debts of at least £35million incurred by foreign national patients since 2002. As well as restrictions on students and non-working migrants from the EU, ministers are understood to be considering making non-EU migrants have health insurance before being granted a visa. Downing Street said the Government was determined to prevent potential damage to the labour market from a fresh influx of migrants, but acknowledged Britain will have to operate within EU rules on the right to free movement. The Government is also examining the idea of an ad campaign telling potential migrants in Romania and Bulgaria that British streets are not necessarily ‘paved with gold’.","Migrants need health insurance to stop NHS becoming 'international' service .

"Blood sucked by a mosquito that died 46 million years ago has been discovered by scientists. Researchers used a new technique to determine the nature of the animal's last meal to prove that the insects have been feeding on blood all this time and could even have feasted on dinosaurs. The mosquito that was discovered perished soon after feeding in the Middle Eocene and its body has been trapped in shale ever since. Researchers used a new technique to determine the nature of the mosquito's last meal to prove that the insects have been feeding on blood all this time and could even have feasted on dinosaurs. The creature's fossilised body (pictured) has been trapped in shale for 46 millions years . The animal died when the spectacular mountain ranges in Montana, where it was dug up, had just finished forming. The ancient insect was so well-preserved because it had been trapped in shale - a type of mudstone in which organic remains decompose much more slowly - and the soft mud material that surrounded it compressed the creature's body without distorting it. The fine grain size of shale also preserves more details and the process of fossilisation is much like holding the fossil flat and pressing it like a book protects a dried flower. Paleobiologist Dr Dale Greenwalt, a researcher at the Smithsonian's National History Museum, who led the study, used a state-of-the-art technology called non-destructive mass spectrometry to produce a detailed chemical picture of the mosquito's stomach contents. The findings show the insects have been feeding on blood for millions of years and around 14,000 living insect species including fleas, ticks and modern mosquitoes feed on blood today. Although . this feeding strategy appears to have evolved independently across a . variety of animals, fossil evidence of this behaviour is extremely rare. The find extends the fossil record of blood-feeding in this family of . insects by 46 million years, according to Dr Ralph Harbach, a researcher at the Natural history Museum in London who was involved with the study. Dr Dale Greenwalt used non-destructive mass spectrometry to produce a detailed chemical picture of the mosquito's stomach contents. The findings show the insects have been feeding on blood for millions of years and around 14,000 living insect species including fleas, ticks and modern mosquitoes (pictured) feed on blood today . After finding high levels of iron in the fossilised insect's abdomen, the researchers analysed the specimen and identified the source as haem - the protein in the blood responsible for the transport of oxygen. Although large and fragile molecules such as DNA generally do not survive fossilisation, the mosquito proves certain complex organic molecules such as haem can be preserved. It was one of two mosquitoes discovered in the shale deposits that reveal just how remarkably little the parasites have changed in the last 46 million years. The new fossils - one female and the other male - are so detailed scientists were able to determine they represent two previously unknown species. The female, named Culiseta lemniscata, had eaten the blood meal. The male has been named Culiseta kishenehn. Their fossils contain details as intricate as wing veins, sexual organs, scales and hair-like structures on the wings. Dr Greenwalt said it's not surprising that it is the first discovery of its kind despite the misconception of dinosaur DNA recovery from mosquitoes preserved in amber popularised by Jurassic Park twenty years ago - Richard Attenborough in the film is pictured . Dr Greenwalt and colleagues, whose findings are published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said the preservation of the fossil was 'extremely improbable'. 'The insect had to take a blood meal, be blown to the water's surface and sink to the bottom of a pond or similar structure to be quickly embedded in fine sediment - all without disruption of its fragile distended blood-filled abdomen.' He said it is not surprising that it is the first discovery of its kind despite the misconception of dinosaur DNA recovery from mosquitoes preserved in amber popularised by Jurassic Park twenty years ago. 'The existence of this rare specimen extends the existence of blood-feeding behaviour in this family of insects 46 million years into the past,' Dr Greenwalt said. 'This is the only known fossil of a blood-engorged mosquito ever found and represents the first clear evidence that some organic molecules can be preserved in a fossil of this age. 'We made the assumption that genetic material like DNA was not preserved. We didn’t even attempt to look at it because DNA degrades very quickly. 'Without question there are probably other things contained in this fossil. We just don’t know what they might be,' he added.","The mosquito perished soon after feeding in the Middle Eocene and its body has been trapped in shale ever since .

"Liberal Democrat MP Mr Hemming warned that cases can be skewed against parents because councils hold ¿all the cards¿ . Parents who face having their children taken away by social workers should flee abroad rather than go through the ‘unfair’ family courts, an MP has declared. Controversial families campaigner John Hemming spoke out as evidence emerged suggesting children are being wrongly taken into care – when injuries caused by vitamin deficiency are assumed to be signs of abuse. Babies who do not get enough Vitamin D can suffer fractures. In several cases children have been taken because the courts ruled injuries were caused by mistreatment, a BBC Panorama documentary will claim tonight. And Liberal Democrat MP Mr Hemming warned that cases can be skewed against parents because councils hold ‘all the cards’. The chairman of the Justice for Families group said he has been contacted by hundreds of parents who believe they have been unfairly targeted by social services. He said: ‘All the cards are held by the local authority. It has the resources to fight the cases, it does all the assessments.’ He added: ‘My advice to people if they can afford it is just to go abroad. You can’t get a fair trial here, because you can’t rely on the evidence being fair. It’s best simply to go if you can, at the right time, lawfully.’ His comments come amid concerns over the record number of children being taken into care by councils – more than 11,000 last year. The BBC documentary looks at four families who say their babies were unfairly taken away because of injuries which were the result of Vitamin D deficiency. Mother Jill McCartan, 25, took her daughter Alyssa to hospital after noticing swelling on her arm back in May 2010. Doctors spotted four tiny fractures, Wokingham Borough Council took her into care and Alyssa has now been adopted. Escape: Jill Mccarten and son Lo'iq who fled to Spain after her daughter was adopted . When her mother became pregnant again, she was determined not to let social services intervene – and decided to flee to Spain where her son Lo’iq was born.

"When it comes to hair, women should pay more attention to what goes in their mouths rather than on their heads . You can spend hundreds on conditioners and treatments — but healthy, beautiful hair is more about what you put into your body than what you slather on your head. Ricardo Vila Nova, resident trichologist at Urban Retreat in Harrods says: ‘Poor diet can cause hair thinning and hair loss as well as lacklustre hair, dryness and excess sebum. A high-stress lifestyle and bad nutrition can be catalysts for damage which may need four years to recover.’ If your hair keeps breaking, eat red . meat: ‘Iron is a top strength booster,’ says Vila Nova. It carries the . blood’s supply of oxygen around the body keeping hair strong and . nourished. Thin and limp hair is the first sign that you aren’t getting enough iron. As red meat is a great source of iron, eat a portion of beef or lamb at least twice a week. Vegetarian? Lentils and tofu are also good  sources of iron. Going grey? Try chocolate. Melanin, the pigment that forms the colour in your hair and skin, is responsible for keeping your tresses vibrant. Foods that boost the presence of melanin in your body include chocolate (especially the dark variety). If you want softer hair, eating salmon might help as the Omega-3 and 6 it contains boost scalp health. Essential fatty acids keep the scalp moisturised, help hair maintain hydration and elasticity. Oily fish such as tuna, salmon and mackerel are excellent sources of fatty acids: eat them once or twice a week. Finally, avocados and walnuts could boost hair shine. The . better lubricated the cuticle layer on your hair, the smoother the . surface of the hair and the shinier it looks. Bon appetit! Eating a bar of chocolate can help ward off greys  while tofu is a good source of protein to help thicken hair .","Limp and thin hair can be a sign of lack of iron so eat extra protein .

"An elderly farmer who had his ribcage shattered by a two-tonne bull has made an amazing recovery thanks to pioneering ‘Meccano’ surgery. Lawrence Haygarth, 70, was left breathless and in agony after his prized Belgian Blue repeatedly charged into his chest and pummelled him on the ground on a hillside at Kelleth Rigg, near Tebay, Cumbria. The grandfather sustained life-threatening injuries including 11 broken ribs, a dislocated shoulder, a punctured lung, torn ligaments and a dislocated sternum. He only survived because his nine-year-old grandson Alfie saw the attack and ran half a mile to find help. Lawrence Haygarth, 70, suffered life-threatening injuries when he was attacked by his two-tonne bull . Mr Haygarth only survived because his grandson, Alfie Green (pictured with dogs, Flo and Spud) ran half a mile to find help . As a result of the attack, which took place in October 2011, he was forced to retire and sell his prize herd. However, after pioneering surgery to rebuild his ribcage using plates and screws at the Blackpool Victoria Hospital, he is now able to breathe properly again. The new technique sees tailor made surgical plates pinned to the broken bones to alleviate pain and speed up recovery. It can allow patients to escape complications such as pneumonia, breathing difficulties and chest deformity and has a recovery time of just a few days. Until recently, the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healed. This . could take months and left the patient in danger of complications such . as breathing difficulties, pneumonia and chest deformity. Mr Haygarth had been bringing his herd in for winter when the Belgian Blue bull attacked him. During the attack Mr Haygarth sustained 11 broken ribs . He said: ‘He crushed my chest; I could feel my bones breaking. He tossed me about ten feet in the air. ‘Eventually he threw me behind a stone wall, I thought I was dying.’ Fortunately, . his nine-year-old grandson Alfie Green saw the attack and raised the . alarm. But the bull refused to move until the downdraft from the air . ambulance's rotors forced it away. Alfie ran half a mile back to the family farmhouse and flagged down part-time farm worker Andrew Clark, who called for help. ‘My granddad called me to stay with him but I knew he needed help so I ran as fast as I could,’ said Alfie. Mr . Lawrence was airlifted to the Royal Lancaster Infirmary where his . injuries prompted a transfer to the cardiac care and intensive care unit . at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. Surgeon, Mr Nidal Bittar (left), repaired Mr Haygarth's ribs using plates and screws . The surgeon likened the procedure (demonstrated in theory in the image) to using Meccano . Surgeons said he was extremely lucky to have survived the attack. ‘My lungs were filling up fast with fluid and I could hardly breathe,’ said Mr Haygarth. ‘They just got to me in time.’ Mr Haygarth has nothing but praise for the cardiothoracic surgeon who operated on him. ‘The . procedure Mr Nidal Bittar carried out on me was grand. I'm getting a . lot better and it has improved the quality of my life,’ he said. ‘I still get out of breath at times, but I can do so much more than I could. ‘I can saw wood and hammer in nails, I even built a shed recently and can take walks again in the fells.’ He added: ‘I retired after the accident because I couldn't carry on with the work and sold all the cattle . ‘I . had planned to carry on farming for a little longer, but it wasn't . possible after the attack, but now I feel quite well and I could start . again - but I don't think my wife would let me!’ Following the surgery the 'Meccano' plates and screws are visible on an X-ray of Mr Haygarth's chest . His surgeon, Mr Bittar, said that . pain would have been 'part and parcel' of Mr Haygarth's life without the . surgery, flaring up every time he moved. However, after the surgery, which 'screwed' the ribs back into place, he felt the pain relief almost immediately. Mr . Bittar said: ‘If the ribs are unstable the patient cannot breathe . properly. The fixator, called a Synthes Rib Matrix, guarantees . stability. It allows the patient to breathe and reduces the pain level.’ Likening the procedure to a . 'Meccano' set, he added: ‘We now have the technology to stabilise . fractures, pulling the ribs back into place using plates which are . attached to the bone with screws.’ Until recently, the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healed. This . could take months and left the patient in danger of complications such . as breathing difficulties, pneumonia and chest deformity. The new technique, Synthes Rib Matrix, sees patients undergo a 2 hour operation which is available both on the NHS and privately. During the surgery, tailor made plates are pinned to the broken bones to speed up recovery and alleviate pain. Each plate is about half an inch wide and is shaped to match the contours of the ribs. The recovery time from the operation is only a few days. The plates are left in the body for the rest of the patient's life.","Lawrence Haygarth was attacked by his bull in a field near Tebay, Cumbria .

"A curiously phallus-shaped prehistoric worm has provided a 'crucial missing link' to understanding the evolution of certain marine creatures, scientists say. Fossilised remains of the creature dubbed Spartobranchus tenuis were unearthed in Canada's Burgess Shale fossil beds, in the Yoho National Park. The area is one of the most important fossil deposits for understanding the early evolution of life during an era of increasing biodiversity on Earth known as the Cambrian Explosion, which started about 542million years ago. Phallic: Scientists say this newly described creature, dubbed Spartobranchus tenuis, is a common ancestor to two related groups of marine invertebrates whose evolutionary link was previously a mystery . Researchers from the University of Montreal today published the first full description of the creature, found in an area thought to be about 505million years old, in the journal Nature. The strange-looking invertebrate is thought to be a previously unknown ancestor of the acorn worm, or enteropneust, a seldom seen animal that thrives today in the fine sands and mud of shallow and deeper waters. 'Unlike animals with hard parts including teeth, scales and bones, these worms were soft-bodied, so their fossil record is extremely rare,' said study author Dr Chris Cameron. 'Our description of Spartobranchus tenuis, a creature previously unknown to science, pushes the fossil record of the enteropneusts back 200million years to the Cambrian period, fundamentally changing our understanding of biodiversity from this period.' Detailed analysis suggests . Spartobranchus tenuis had a flexible body consisting of a short . proboscis, collar and narrow elongate trunk terminating in a bulbous . structure, which may have served as an anchor. The largest complete specimens examined . were 10cm long with the proboscis accounting for about half a . centimetre. It is thought they probably fed on small particles filtered . from seawater. 'Crucial missing link': The strange-looking invertebrate is thought to be a previously unknown ancestor of the acorn worm, or enteropneust, and the sea stars and sea urchins, known as pterobranchs . Enteropneusts, Spartobranchus's modern . day descendants, are themselves part of the hemichordates, a group of . marine animals closely related to today's sea stars and sea urchins, . known as pterobranchs. Since . their discovery in the 19th-century, some of the biggest questions in . hemichordate evolution have focused on the group's origins and the . relationship between these two branches. The . Cambrian explosion, or Cambrian radiation, was the relatively rapid . appearance, around 530million years ago, of most major animal phyla, as . demonstrated in the fossil record. Before . about 580million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of . individual cells occasionally organized into colonies. Over . the following 70 or 80million years, the rate of evolution accelerated . by an order of magnitude (as defined in terms of the extinction and . origination rate of species) and the diversity of life began to resemble . that of today. It ended with the Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event, approximately 488million years ago. Enteropneusts and pterobranchs look very different, yet share many genetic and developmental characteristics that reveal an otherwise unexpected close relationship. Professor Simon Conway Morris from the . University of Cambridge, who also worked on the study, told the BBC: . 'Enteropneusts look very different from pterobranchs in as much as the . former are worms, whereas the latter are tiny animals, live in tubes, . are colonial and have feeding tentacles.' The . new insights into Spartobranchus tenuis has shown that it was a common . ancestor of both groups, finally providing the missing evolutionary link . between these two groups, the researchers say. 'One . of the big punchlines from my graduate work, was molecular evidence . that enteropneusts and pterobranchs are closely related,' added Dr . Cameron, who specialises in the taxonomy, evolution and biogeography of . hemichordates. 'It's . astonishing how similar Spartobranchus tenuis fossils are to modern day . acorn worms, except that they also formed fibrous tubes.' Modern day descendant: Enteropneusts (pictured) and pterobranchs look very different, yet share many genetic and developmental characteristics that reveal an otherwise unexpected close relationship . A large proportion of these worms was . preserved in tubes, of which some were branched, suggesting the tubes . were used as a dwelling structure. 'The explosive radiation of . graptolites in the Paleozoic planktonic ecosystems is known only from . the diversity of their tubes,' said Dr Cameron. 'Our . findings suggest that the tubes were lost in the lineage leading to . modern day enteropneusts, but elaborated on in graptolites and retained . to the present day in pterobranchs.' Hemichordates . also share many of the same characteristics as chordates – a group of . animals that includes humans – with the name hemichordate roughly . translating to 'half a chordate.'

"A suburban New York newspaper that outraged gun owners by posting the names and addresses of residents with handgun permits removed the information from its website Friday. The Journal News took down the data just three days after the state enacted a gun control law that included privacy provisions for permit holders. The provisions were a reaction to interactive maps the newspaper published on LoHud.com that pinpointed thousands of permit holders in Westchester and Rockland counties. Scare: An envelope of white powder is a latest threat targeted at New York paper The News Journal after it published a list of gun permit owners in the area (STOCK PHOTO) Gun rights activists had immediately . complained that permit owners' privacy was being violated. They said the . map could guide burglars to their homes while police groups claimed the . map could lead ex-convicts to the officers who had put them away. The addresses of some Journal News . staffers were posted online, and threats were called in to the . newspaper's offices. The newspaper hired armed guards in response. Janet Hasson, president and publisher . of The Journal News Media Group, said in an emailed statement, ""While . the new law does not require us to remove the data, we believe that . doing so complies with its spirit."" She said the maps had been viewed . nearly 1.2 million times since they were published Dec. 23. The . newspaper sought the records under the state Freedom of Information Law . after the Dec. 14 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn., where a . gunman who had killed his mother at home killed 20 first-graders and six . educators and then committed suicide. The maps remained online late Friday but could no longer be manipulated to find names and addresses. State Sen. Greg Ball, the most vocal . opponent of the posting, said, ""Thank God The Journal News has finally . realized the error in their judgment and done the right thing. ... I am . proud to have passed legislation keeping The Journal News from doing . this ever again."" On Tuesday, as part of a gun control . bill, the state Legislature passed and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed new . regulations that give permit holders several ways to opt out of the . public record. Applicants can ask to be exempted . because they are police officers or served on criminal-case juries or . are victims of domestic violence. They also can just say they might be . subjected to harassment. Hasson said Friday, ""One of our core missions as a newspaper is to . empower our readers with as much information as possible on the critical . issues they face, and guns have certainly become a top issue since the . massacre in nearby Newtown, Conn."" The paper caused a stir on December 23 when it listed thousands of . pistol permit holders in suburban Westchester and Rockland counties just . north of New York City in an interactive map on its website. Editor Caryn A. McBride hired gun-toting security guards to patrol the paper's offices amid a flurry of angry emails and phone calls in the following days. The paper hired the increased security from RGA Investigations & Security, a firm based in New City that provides services like protection and security guard certification, according to the Times. The news came just days after the Journal News announced plans to publish an expanded list of  even more permit-holding locals. On the list: As well as Journal News the website Gawker published a 446-page list of licensed gun owners in New York City . Along with an article entitled 'The . gun owner next door: What you don't know about the weapons in your . neighborhood,' the Journal News map was compiled in response to the December 14 . shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut, . editors of the Gannett Corp.-owned newspaper said. The next batch of names will be . permit holders in suburban Putnam County, New York, where the county . clerk told the newspaper it is still compiling information. Some 44,000 people are licensed to . own pistols in the three counties, the newspaper said. Owners of rifles . and shotguns do not need permits, the newspaper said. The publication prompted outrage, particularly on social media sites, among gun owners. 'Do you fools realize that you also . made a map for criminals to use to find homes to rob that have no guns . in them to protect themselves?' Rob Seubert of Silver Spring, Maryland, . posted on the newspaper's web site. 'What a bunch of liberal boobs you . all are.' Republican state Senator Greg Ball of . Patterson, New York, said he planned to introduce legislation to keep . permit information private except to prosecutors and police. Naming names: The paper caused a stir on December 23 when it listed thousands of pistol permit holders in suburban Westchester and Rockland counties just north of New York City in an interactive map on its website . A similar bill that he introduced earlier as an Assemblyman failed in the state Assembly. 'The asinine editors at the Journal . News have once again gone out of their way to place a virtual scarlet . letter on law abiding firearm owners throughout the region,' Ball wrote . on his Senate web site. The newspaper's editor and vice . president of news, CynDee Royle, earlier in the week defended the . decision to list the permit holders. 'We knew publication of the database . would be controversial, but we felt sharing as much information as we . could about gun ownership in our area was important in the aftermath of . the Newtown shootings,' she said. Some critics retaliated by posting reporters' and editors' addresses and other personal information online. Howard Good, a journalism professor . at the State University of New York at New Paltz, called the critics' response childish and petulant. Calling for change: The paper said that they produced the map because in the wake of the Newtown shooting many people wanted to know who had legal guns in their neighborhood, and there were protests across the country (pictured) 'It doesn't move the issue of gun . control to the level of intelligent public discussion,' he said. 'Instead, it transforms what should be a rational public debate on a . contentious issue into ugly gutter fighting.' Good said the information about permit holders was public and, if presented in context, served a legitimate interest. But media critic Al Tompkins of the . Florida-based Poynter Institute wrote online this week that the . newspaper's reporting had not gone far enough to justify the permit . holders' loss of privacy. 'If journalists could show flaws in . the gun permitting system, that would be newsworthy,' he said. 'Or, for . example, if gun owners were exempted from permits because of political . connections, then journalists could better justify the privacy . invasion.' Tompkins said he feared the dispute might prompt lawmakers to play to privacy fears. 'The net effect of the abuse of public . records from all sides may well be a public distaste for opening . records, which would be the biggest mistake of all,' he said.","The Journal News published names and addresses of gun permit owners on December 23 .

"A new type of vaccine has been developed which could provide long-term protection and last a lifetime against all types of influenza . A new type of vaccine has been developed which could provide long-term protection and last a lifetime against all types of influenza. The 'universal' vaccine targets part of the virus common to all strains, meaning it could provide a way around the problem of the bug frequently mutating and making preventative treatment ineffective. It was created by a team working for U.S. healthcare company Sanofi using techniques that have also raised hopes of a new generation of vaccines against other diseases. The study has been published in the journal Nature. Team leader Gary Nabel said: 'This structure-based vaccine improves the potency and breadth of influenza virus immunity, and it provides a foundation for building broader vaccine protection against emerging influenza viruses and other pathogens.' Influenza kills between 250,000 and 500,000 globally per year, according to the World Health Organisation. Earlier this month experts warned a deadly bird flu virus sweeping through China had taken the first steps towards becoming a global threat to human populations. In the space of one month, the avian strain known as H7N9 spread through all 31 Chinese provinces and claimed 125 victims, killing a fifth of those infected. Scientists say it is mutating rapidly and already has two of five genetic changes believed to be necessary for human-to-human transmission. Currently the virus has made its home in chickens, and only affected people who have had close contact with the birds, often at live markets. The Sanofi team's vaccine is built using protein 'self-assembling nanoparticles', which when injected create antibodies that attach themselves to parts of the virus that are common to different strains. In lab tests on ferrets, which can suffer the same strains of flu as humans, it was more potent and affected more strains than the current licensed vaccine, the team said. An employee wearing a protection suit sprays disinfectant on chickens at a poultry market in Hefei, Anhui, China following an outbreak of a deadly bird fly virus . It is also safer to make than standard vaccines, which are produced by growing the virus in a lab. The DIY way it is made means similar methods could be used to create vaccines against other diseases. Scientists gave a cautious welcome to the research, but said trials on humans were needed to see if it worked as well as hoped. Professor Wendy Barclay, chair in influenza virology at Imperial College London, said the research targeted a 'soft underbelly of the virus'. 'In short this paper takes us a step closer to believing that a universal flu vaccine is possible, by thinking outside of the box in terms of how to synthesise and manufacture flu vaccines,' she said. 'What's more this route could be faster, cheaper and safer than the one we usually use.' Professor Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford, added:'There's no indication as to whether any clinical trials are planned, and since this is a new type of vaccine it might be some time before they could start. 'So at the moment it's an interesting development in the lab, with some novel aspects, but definitely not a universal influenza vaccine and it needs to be tested in clinical trials before we get too excited.'","The vaccine targets part of the virus common to all strains .

"Any move by our national game to bring back football in place of professional wrestling can expect the support of Sepp Blatter. When FIFA’s president revealed exclusively to me in an interview screened at the SoccerEx convention in Manchester that he would be pioneering more new technology, we also discussed the plague of arm-grappling, head-locking, shirt-pulling and body slamming which is infecting and disfiguring the beautiful game. Having disclosed his plans for following up goal-line technology with video challenges by managers and coaches against refereeing decisions, Blatter addressed the epidemic use of arms in challenges, saying: ‘This is the next issue we need to examine.’ Sportsmail has now launched a campaign entitled Hands Off In The Box, which highlights how this abuse of the laws and spirit of the game is at its ugliest from corners and free kicks. This penalty box incident caused controversy in Sunday's Manchester United vs Chelsea clash - on the left, Branislav Ivanovic wrestles with Chris Smalling while on the right, John Terry grapples Marcos Rojo . This reverse angle shows Rojo push Terry to the floor while Smalling can be seen with his arm around the neck of Ivanovic in the background . Proposals are being tabled for a summit meeting between leading referees and officials of the FA, the Premier and Football Leagues and the PFA. Since the laws of the game already prohibit the use of hands and arms, all it will take is for a consensus to be reached. Then club managers can be advised how rules are to be applied more strictly. No matter how draconian the implementation of the regulations, they can act confident of approval from the governing body of the world game. In fact, they can set an example to be followed around the planet, all the way up to World Cups. Blatter added: ‘The name of the game is football and that needs to be respected.’ Stoke's Ryan Shawcross (right) did concede a penalty for this grapple with Swansea's Wilfried Bony last week . Liverpool's Martin Skrtel has also been penalised in the past for penalty area blocking . Similarly, the proper art of defending needs to be revived. Attacking the ball rather than the opponent, clever positioning and well-timed tackling without loss of balance are skills being substituted by primitive tactics more suited to the WWE. There is a revealing sequence of photographs which show Bobby Moore relieving George Best of the ball with an intervention of such immaculate precision that England’s World Cup-winning captain kept his footing throughout. If the most gifted of all British footballers – and one of the greatest of all time – could be dispossessed with such brilliant dexterity while in full flight, it should not be beyond today’s super-fit defenders to deny comparatively lesser forwards without dragging them bodily to the ground. Bobby Moore (right) shows how it should be done, tackling Chelsea's Charlie Cooke in 1970 . Sepp Blatter (left) and Jeff Powell spoke at length about the weighty issues facing the beautiful game . Cynically, the most blatant culprits are those who end to badger the referees to their faces whenever decisions go against them. That is another ill of which the game needs curing. But one step at a time. It is the wrestling which is spoiling our game as a spectacle. So Hands Off In The Box - and all over the pitch for the matter.","Sportsmail has launched a campaign to stop Premier League footballers wrestling, grappling and shirt pulling opponents in the penalty box .

"Fish oil can counter the negative effect junk food has on the brain, say scientists. More than a decade of research has shown that high-fat diets can impact the brain by disrupting 'neurogenesis', a process that generates new nerve cells. Now University of Liverpool researchers have discovered that diets rich in omega-3s, such as fish oil, can prevent these negative effects by stimulating the area of the brain that controls feeding, learning and memory. Research: Scientists say fish oil can counter the negative effect junk food has on the brain . The team from the University's Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease originally set out to look at research from across to world to see whether the data suggested that omega-3s had a role to play in aiding weight loss. However, although data from the 185 research papers indicated fish oils do not have a direct impact on this process, it found that they play a significant role in reversing the damage high fats can cause the brain. Researcher Dr Lucy Pickavance explained: 'Body weight is influenced by many factors, and some of the most important of these are the nutrients we consume. 'Excessive intake of certain macronutrients, the refined sugars and saturated fats found in junk food, can lead to weight gain, disrupt metabolism and even affect mental processing. Study: Diets rich in omega-3s prevent the negative effects by stimulating the area of the brain that controls feeding, learning and memory . 'These changes can be seen in the brain's structure, including its ability to generate new nerve cells, potentially linking obesity to neurodegenerative diseases. 'Research, however, has suggested that omega-3 fish oils can reverse or even prevent these effects. We wanted to investigate the literature on this topic to determine whether there is evidence to suggest that omega-3s might aid weight loss by stimulating particular brain processes.' The research papers showed that on high-fat diets hormones that are usually secreted from body tissues into the circulation after eating - which protect neurons and stimulate their growth - are prevented from passing into the brain by increased circulation of inflammatory molecules and a type of fat called triglycerides. Molecules that stimulate nerve growth are also reduced. But it appears - in studies with animal models - that omega-3s restore normal function by interfering with the production of these inflammatory molecules, suppressing triglycerides, and returning these nerve growth factors to normal. Dr Pickavance added: 'Fish oils don't appear to have a direct impact on weight loss, but they may take the brakes off the detrimental effects of some of the processes triggered in the brain by high-fat diets. 'They seem to mimic the effects of calorie restrictive diets and including more oily fish or fish oil supplements in our diets could certainly be a positive step forward for those wanting to improve their general health.'","Researchers at Liverpool University say fish oil prevents negative effects .

"The new Mike Tyson does not look like the old Mike Tyson. Gennady Golovkin has a baby face unadorned by menacing warrior tattoos but he is a prize-ring assassin just the same. As the real world middleweight champion he is, naturally, smaller than the youngest man ever to win the world heavyweight title. Gennady Golovkin is the new Mike Tyson in the ring, but not outside of it . Golovkin (left) knocks down Daniel Geale during their WBA/IBO Middleweight bout last July . He is also respectful of his opponents, unfailingly polite to all he meets, rarely if ever swears in any of the four languages he speaks fluently, often dresses like an English country gentleman, regularly takes his son on the school run in his adopted Germany and has a smile like sunshine. But this is where the dissimilarities end: Outside the ring. The Kazakh known as GGG – his middle name is a longer version of his first name – is the most powerful pound-for-pound puncher in the world. Deontay Wilder may be the biggest-hitting heavyweight but in terms of comparative size, Golovkin is the most devastating. It appears that not even the most thunderous of the light-heavyweights can live with him. Sergey Kovalev, the Russian Krusher who flattened Nathan Cleverly and recently ended the long championship reign of Bernard Hopkins, is reported to have withdrawn from sparring with Golovkin because he was getting badly hurt. Kovalev’s trainer is in denial about that but the anecdotal evidence is plentiful. Golovkin has knocked out 28 of his 31 victims in an all-win professional career thus far and St Helens’ own Martin Murray is next to climb the scaffold, in Monte Carlo on Saturday night. Golovkin, dressed like an English country gentleman, during a visit to London to promote his fight . Tyson (right) in action against Buster Mathis Jnr in Philadelphia in August 1995 . Tyson is pictured in modern day guise, complete with facial tattoos . He has not been taken the distance since an eight-rounder all of six years and 18 fights ago. Nor, since he seems to have a chin as granite as his fists, has he ever been knocked off his own feet. Not for a second. That charming demeanour evaporates when the first bell rings. Golovkin becomes a destructive monster and if you keep your hands up to protect your head he simply sets about disembowelling you. Matthew Macklin, the much-respected and usually durable Anglo-Irish middleweight contender, was crumpled by a single body shot and reports: ‘I’ve never been hit that hard in my life. It’s scary.’ This man certainly appears to put the wind up even the most accomplished boxers around his weight. Golovkin has been trying, so far in vain, to secure big-name fights against the likes of Sergio Martinez, Miguel Cotto and Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr. He says: ‘I want these major fights but what can I do if they won’t get in the ring with me.’ Golovkin in action against Curtis Stevens during their WBA Middleweight Title fight in New York in 2013 . It is to Murray’s enormous credit that he has agreed to venture where others fear to tread despite the lure of Golovkin’s WBA and IBO world titles being at stake. All the more so since this one-man wrecking ball is in his prime at 32. Murray freely admits that Felix Sturm and Martinez were somewhat in decline when they inflicted the only minor blemishes on his record, a controversial draw and a disputed defeat in those respective world title challenges. Not Golovkin, who patiently built the foundation of his career through 350 amateur fights of which he won all but five. The professional steel which is his backbone now was embedded in boyhood. Golovkin throws a left jab at Marco Antonio Rubio during the WBC middleweight title  bout last October . Golavkin celebrates after knocking out Geale to defend his WBA/IBO middleweight titles last July . Two of Golovkin’s four brothers were killed in mysterious action when serving with the Soviet army in the 1990s. But they knew GGG was the most ferocious of them and when they were growing up together in Kazakhstan they used to challenge grown men to fight the seven-year-old Gennady in the streets, where he gave them a beating. The Russian government declined to disclose details of their deaths or permit funerals. ‘It was a very hard time for us,’ says Golovkin. ‘Our family was torn apart.’ Now he honours the memory of his late siblings in the ring. Monte Carlo’s sumptuous Salle des Etoiles is a world far removed from the grimy town of Karaganda, where his coal-miner father and Korean mother struggled to bring them all up. But the chandeliers of this casino ballroom will glitter down on either Gennady Golovkin hammering out his latest concussive triumph…or Martin Murray springing one of boxing’s bigger surprises.

"The Bad Santa’s Christmas sack is coming but this year it is not only the usual suspects who are feeling the big chill. By seasonal custom it is the humble basement bosses in the Premier League who check whether their P45s come through the letter box with the greetings cards. Now, if not facing festive dismissal quite yet, one or two of the big boys are beginning to sense that the skids could be under them. Yaya Toure, Raheem Sterling and Lukas Podolski looks dejected after a week of disappointment in Europe . Europe is the destination of choice for the major clubs but when Champions League matches go the way they have in the past few days these can be perilous journeys for the managers. Who would have thought, as recently as a week ago, that Manuel Pellegrini, Arsene Wenger and Brendan Rodgers would be planning extra helpings not of turkey and Christmas pudding but hard tack. Let us consider them in turn: . SENOR PELLEGRINI spent the latter part of this Wednesday evening confessing that his costly Manchester City have lost nerve, faith, confidence and, potentially most damaging of all for himself, trust. Just one win in five matches speaks to the truth of that self-wounding assessment and had that solitary victory not come against Manchester United then Pellegrini would be on even slipperier ground already. Manuel Pellegrini has won just one of his last five games as Manchester City have started to stumble . Seydou Doumbia (centre) did the damage with CSKA Moscow's goals in their 2-1 win over Manchester City . How far have the English champions fallen? As low as losing at home to a distinctly ordinary CSKA Moscow and having two of their prima donnas sent off during that humiliating process. Pellegrini answers to foreign owners who regard the Champions League as the Holy Grail. City captain Vincent Kompany looks disappointed at the end of the defeat by CSKA Moscow . City’s prospects of surviving a relatively easy group depend now on Bayern Munich, who have already qualified, either sending their reserves to the Etihad or treating that fixture as a practice match. Feliz Navidad, Manuel. MONSIEUR WENGER whiled away his Tuesday evening watching Arsenal throw away a three-goal lead at home against the Belgian lightweights of Anderlecht. The boos rained down in North London as he turned away from the scene of that debacle. The fans, let alone the directors, can see that this team are, quite literally, defenceless. Even the most respectful of former players are beginning to query why the manager has not bought top-class centre-backs. It looked as if Arsene Wenger would have an easy night when Arsenal went 3-0 up against Anderlecht... But the Arsenal manager could hardly look as his side threw away their three-goal lead at the Emirates . That question would be asked with greater urgency right now if Arsenal were not still in position to go through to the last 16. For the moment, it is being conveniently forgotten that Wenger’s esoteric ensemble would be scrambling to advance had they not been fortunate enough to pull a last-gasp victory out of a wretched performance at Anderlecht in the preceding match. As it is they are looking at second place, yet again, with its implicit danger of a deadly draw in the next round. And, like City, they have not started the Premier League season at all well. Arsenal pair Santi Cazorla and Lukas Podolski look dejected after throwing away a three goal lead . The Arsenal board are historically patient and respectful of Wenger, who achieved so much in his early years there. But for how much longer? Joyeux Noel, Arsene. MISTER RODGERS, meanwhile, splashed through only the first half of his sudden watershed on Tuesday. By scorning the highest European tradition with his decision to send a weakened Liverpool team into Real Madrid’s fabled Bernabeu, this manager has impaled himself on the imperative of his rested first-teamers defeating Chelsea at Anfield this weekend. Or at least avoiding defeat. If Liverpool lose this one – and slump even further adrift of the Premier League leaders – the carrion will make a meal of Rodgers come Saturday lunchtime. Brendan Rodgers made seven changes to the Liverpool side he sent out to face Real Madrid . If so, that feast will come early. Rodgers was so recently hailed as the saviour of Anfield that a descent into doubt this soon seemed impossible. He is bringing it in part upon himself. Far be it from a sportswriter to advise a manager to turn off the quotes tap but Rodgers really needs to put thinking time between brain and mouth. As an example of his tendency to damage himself, how about this cracker at the dinner in May at which the Uruguayan Dracula of the game was dubiously installed as our Footballer of the Year: ‘I am a better person for knowing Luis Suarez.’ In the end Rodgers and Liverpool only lost to the European champions by one goal . Nor, judging from his jocular appearance at subsequent training, does he understand even now the implications of a club of Liverpool’s European pedigree playing for damage limitation rather than glory at the Bernabeu. Among the chorus of disapproval, one Anfield legend asked: ‘What is the point of making qualification for next season’s Champions League the priority when you are playing Real Madrid this week?’ Rodgers, in training with Glen Johnson, appeared to be over the Madrid defeat at training on Thursday morning . That is not a question which will sit comfortably on his CV if ever he tries to pursue his professed ambition to manage in the upper echelons of La Liga. Worse still if Liverpool go out to – er - Basle. Merry Christmas, Brendan. Despite being held to a draw in Slovenia by the moderates of Maribor, Chelsea’s Jose Mourinho is iceberg proof this winter. Not only is he virtually certain of reaching the Champions League last 16 but Chelsea are top of the Premier League. Jose Mourinho is sitting pretty in Europe despite a midweek draw and his team are flying high in the league . However, the English game at large needs higher quality performances from Chelsea as much as from City, Arsenal and Liverpool... and Manchester United for that matter. This Champions League week – and not for the first time - has not cast the Premier League in a flattering light. Chelsea's Nemanja Matic celebrates his goal with teammates during the draw with Maribor . The best league in the world? Not even close unless the marquee clubs raise their game considerably, starting this weekend with Liverpool and Chelsea putting on a spectacle, Manchester City and United dazzling QPR and Crystal Palace respectively and Arsenal grafting substance onto style at Swansea.","Manchester City are bottom of their Champions League group after losing at home to CSKA Moscow .

"His foreign secretary said last week that the only way to revive Britain's flagging economy was to work harder. But it appears William Hague's blunt words may not apply to David Cameron who found time to go home and change into jeans before whisking his wife out for a swanky meal last night. With thoughts of the recession, the euro meltdown and LOL-gate placed firmly to one side 'call me Dave' seemed determined to enjoy 'date night' at Oslo Court in north London. With its salmon-pink decor and retro puddings, critics say the French restaurant is like stepping back into the 1970s . Did you have to wear that coat darling? David Cameron and wife Samantha dress down for a night out at French restaurant Oslo Court in north London . Sartorial flair: As ever Mrs Cameron got it right in a classic Breton top and navy trousers with classic taupe coat unlike 'Call Me Dave' who looked like he was off to scoff pie and mash down the local boozer . That decade was dogged by strikes and economic decline too, which may explain why Mr Cameron chose to dine at Oslo Court instead of his regular haunts in upmarket Kensington. According to a source, the Camerons had been celebrating a family birthday at the restaurant. After tucking into half a dozen oysters and the veal chop the Prime Minister is thought to have eaten a slice of birthday cake before heading home. In a recent interview he explained how his weekly date night with his wife was important for maintaining a healthy marriage. But the only way to bring colour back into the economy's cheeks after the UK plunged into its first double-dip recession since 1975 is hard work, according to Mr Hague. Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph, he delivered a hammer blow to the country's bosses saying they should stop complaining and get on with reviving economy. Work harder: Foreign Secretary William Hague delivered a hammer blow to the country's bosses saying they should stop complaining and get on with reviving economy by working harder . With its salmon-pink decor and tempting dessert trolley, French restaurant Oslo Court has changed little since opening its doors in 1970. It attracts an older, loyal clientele who wolf down bulging glasses of lobster cocktail and whole globe artichokes. David Cameron last night dined on half a dozen oysters and veal chop, according to a source. But the restaurant in north London also serves up classic beef Wellington, steak, Chateaubriand and is well known for its fresh fish and seafood. The dinner menu is a fixed price of £42.50 with some dishes carrying a small surcharge, allowing you to splash out on a nice bottle of plonk. A bottle of the Bâtard-Montrachet Grand Cru will set you back £199. Puds come courtesy of Egyptian waiter Neil who wheels out his dessert trolley groaning with lemon meringue and tarts in every colour. Current owner Antonio 'Tony' Sanchez - who is 'sadly not French but Spanish' - says he's well used to seeing famous faces in the restaurant. 'Alan Sugar was in last week and we've had Joan Collins. Everyone comes here,' Mr Sanchez told the MailOnline before adding that bar Mr Cameron he hadn't seen many Cabinet members for a while. Mr Hague may be glad to hear it. 'I think they should be getting on with the task of creating more of those jobs and more of those exports, rather than complaining about it,' he said. Asked if his comments could be compared to Lord Norman Tebbit's 'on your bike' message to the unemployed in the 1980s, Mr Hague said: 'It's more than that. It's get on the plane, go and sell things overseas, go and study overseas. 'It's much more than getting on the bike, the bike didn't go that far.' His comments are a direct riposte to business leaders, including chief executive of Sainsbury's Justin King, who criticised the lack of measures for economic growth in the Queen's Speech last week. Mr Hague, a former comprehensive schoolboy from Yorkshire whose parents manufactured soft drinks, is seen as the best person to deliver the tough message, rather than David Cameron or George Osborne, who have been criticised for their privileged backgrounds. But Mr Cameron's privileged background does not appear to have influenced his sartorial choices. In a classic Breton top, stone-coloured jacket and navy trousers, his wife look her usual chic self. But with his shiny 'dad' anorak and pointy work shoes, 'call me Dave' looked ready for pie and mash down the local boozer rather than a lobster cocktail in plush surroundings. In a recent interview the Prime Minister described himself as a 'romantic' and revealed that he tries to take his wife out for dinner on Valentine's Day - if he remembers to book a table early enough. He also revealed he and his wife have a couple of favourite Italian restaurants in upmarket Kensington, west London. Mr Cameron's image took yet another battering earlier this week when he revealed that The Dark Side Of The Moon, by Pink Floyd was his favourite album. Already hounded for being ‘out of touch’ during the economic crisis, critics pointed out that the album appears a fitting choice, featuring tracks including Us And Them, and Money. Labour leader Ed Miliband also delivered a hammer blow during the Queen's speech at the State Opening of Parliament last week. He said: 'In two years, this prime minister has gone from David Cameron to David Brent.' Keeping it alive: Mr Cameron said the couple's weekly date nights help to keep their 16-year marriage going .",Cameron had half a dozen oysters and the veal chop at French restaurant Oslo Court in north London .
"There was a rueful look on Martin Murray’s face as he emerged from the medical examinations which followed his brutally heroic defeat by the heir apparent to Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao as boxing’s pound for pound king. Here, in the plush surroundings of Monte Carlo, stood the second best middleweight on the planet but still with no world championship belt around his waist. Lesser men have held one of those titles but for the third time the hard man from St Helen’s had come up short. Gennady Golovkin connects with a brutal right jab as Martin Murray feels the force of the unbeaten Kazakh . Murray was sent to the canvas three times by a rampant Golovkin but showed guts galore to take the fight into the 11th round . Golovkin grins after another victory for the enormously impressive 32-year-old, who successfully defended his middleweight title once more . 1) Floyd Mayweather . 2) Manny Pacquiao . 3) Wladimir Klitschko . 4) Gennady Golovkin . 5) Roman Gonzalez . 6) Guillermo Rigondeaux . 7) Tim Bradley . 8) Juan Manuel Marquez . 9) Carl Froch . 10) Canelo Alvarezg . Once again there was no shame in losing, on this occasion to the phenomenal Gennady Golovkin. Yet again the demeanour was reminiscent of Aussie great Ken Rosewall whenever he was told that he was the best tennis player never to win Wimbledon. That is a back-handed distinction which Murray remains determined to purge from his resume. ‘Golovkin is a terrific boxer,’ he acknowledged. ‘But I believe that if I fought like this against any of the other belt-holders I would have won. ‘I have to keep going. My day will come.’ There can be a badge of honour in defeat and Murray wore his in the livid scars, purple weals and black bruises on his face. He was clutching one small but worthy victory, that of extending Golovkin The Great as far as the 11th round for the first time in a career littered with the fallen bodies of his opponents. Golovkin is embraced in the ring after another dominant display from arguably the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet . Golovkin is hoisted aloft by a member of his team after demonstrating exactly why he is one of the most feared fighters on the planet . Prince Albert claps as Golovkin clutches his middleweight belts after a convincing display to stop Murray in the 11th . Unlike many of his predecessors, Murray kept getting up after being floored by the most destructive pound-for-pound puncher in the prize-ring. He had never been knocked down before but he dealt with the shock with typical courage. When he did so for the fourth time, after the most devastating blow of all, referee Luis Pabon wisely decreed that he need take no further punishment. That intervention may well have saved Murray to fight another day. Golovkin has ended the careers of several of his challengers and any more of those thunderous punches might have done the same to Murray. Much as would have objected, his corner should have pulled out a little earlier. The problem for Murray is that the strength, determination and no little skill which he brought to this challenge may make it as difficult for him to find opponents as it is for Golovkin. The Kazakh whose 29th victory inside the distance in 32 fights now gives him the highest knock-out ratio in middleweight history is finding unification fights against alternative belt wearers hard to come by. Miguel Cotto is one who is no hurry to meet Golovkin in the ring. Nor is he showing much enthusiasm for giving Murray his fourth title shot. The Monte Carlo crowd were treated to a fight of blood and guts from Murray and unstoppable power and precision from Golovkin . It may be that the man from St Helen’s, who is big for a middleweight, should move up to the super-middle division in which there are more big-money matches to be made. For the time being he will probably focus on pursuing whoever emerges from the winner of Peter Quillin and Andy Lee versus Billy Joe Saunders. ‘I’ve always wanted to clean up against the other domestic fighters,’ he says, ‘but at this stage whoever I can get I need it to be in big fights.’ They won’t come any bigger than Golovkin. Murray has protested about the draw which robbed him in his first title shot against Felix Sturm. He believes he would have been given the decision against Sergio Martinez had the fight not take place in Argentina. But there were no complaints this time. Murray showed the matured and reformed aspect of his nature when he said: ‘It was an honour to be in the ring with someone as good as Golovokin. Not only did I feel his power but he kept coming so hard and fast that it was impossible to keep him off me.’ The maestro returned the compliment: ‘It was not a surprise that he lasted to the 11th round. Murray is a good boxer, one of my toughest opponents and a very brave man.’","Martin Murray's fight was stopped in the 11th round by referee .

"Just when you thought you've seen it all - a company release a gender-neutral sex toy. Swedish company PicoBong have invented The Transformer - it can be used by anyone, regardless of gender or sexual persuasion. The flexible tube has a vibrating tip at either end and can be molded into every type of shape,  meaning that you can use it a million different ways. Scroll down for video . Transformer can be used by people of any gender or sexual persuasion. The Swedish inventors hope it will change how people use sex toys forever . The inventors are hoping the product, which is waterproof, USB-rechargeable and available for £79, will change how people use sex toys forever. Mauricio Garcia, PicoBong Head of Marketing, said: 'There are toys for singles, for couples, for men and for women, but never before has anyone created a toy for everyone. The Transformer aims to awaken sexual exploration and make people realise they don't need to be confined by the labels placed on them.' The website claims: 'The Transformer doesn't care if people are gay, straight, bi, monogamous, polyamorous, trans or cisgender. 'It only cares that people embrace their sexuality and explore it, perfect for her, him, her & him, him & him, her & her, them & them.' The team of young Swedish tech-inventors claim they started to build the prototype after becoming frustrated with the products on offer in traditional sex shops. The website says: 'When you go shopping for a sex toy, you’re faced with a lot of very linear, very clearly defined choices. “This is for the G-spot”. “This is for couples”. “This is for him”. “This is for her”. And so on. 'But the truth is, that kind of approach doesn’t suit everybody, and there are a lot of us who want a sex toy that transcends the same boundaries that we do during sex. 'We want a single brilliant sex toy to do a thousand different things, rather than a thousand different sex toys, each brilliant for a single thing.' 'That’s why we’ve made the Transformer.' The company built prototype after becoming frustrated with products in sex shops . Opinions were mixed about the new product on Twitter though. One user was more concerned with its appearance, writing: 'Transformer makes me think of those really long bendy pencils. Another wrote: 'That looks... Interesting! Nice to see more gender-neutral toys on the market!' And one person was convinced their claims to be the first gender-neutral toy was a stretch of the truth, saying: 'Just saw something advertising the worlds first gender neutral sex toy. All sex toys are gender neutral!'","Transformer can be used by people of any gender or sexual persuasion .

"Adverts for a Ryanair charity calendar featuring stewardesses posing in bikinis have reportedly been banned by a Spanish judge for being sexist. Amanda Cohen ruled that the low-cost airline's adverts for its annual Girls of Ryanair campaign depicted the stewardesses in 'a sexually suggestive manner' following a formal complaint from a consumer group, according to Spanish reports. The calendar, which has been released every year since 2008, shows female cabin crew stripped down to their beachwear. 'Sexist': A Spanish judge has reportedly banned this year's Ryanair charity, right, because of its images of scantily clad air stewardesses, left . The company has raised more than £587,000 for charity through sales with next year's proceeds to go to the Teenage Cancer Trust. But Spanish consumer group Adecua claimed the calendar constitutes advertising with 'sexual connotations' and called for it to be banned. Judge Cohen, sitting at the Commercial Court in Malaga, ruled the cabin crew are shown in 'a sexually suggestive manner' and that 'the female body is being used as a mere object and as part of the appeal of the advert.' In a written ruling she added there was 'an absolute disconnection between the image used and the product being promoted.' Beauties: The stars of the 2014 calendar pose in their uniforms at the launch event earlier this year . She described the advert as 'illegal, discriminatory and unfair.' Although she praised the airline for its 'laudable charity work' the judge said it was 'obvious' the calendar was being used as a marketing tool to sell airline tickets. Ryanair is to appeal the ruling and has formally complained about the judge, alleging that it was unable to defend itself properly at an earlier hearing. The airline sells the calendar, shot in Crete, for £10 or 10 euros on flights and online and a video showing the photo shoot has been watched almost 700,000 times on YouTube. Spanish consumer groups have been calling for the calendar to be banned for the past five years. Despite the reports in Spain that the calendar itself has been banned, the company, which sells 10,000 copies of the calendar a year, said that the ruling does not affect the 2014 calendar or the firm's future charity work. A spokesman said that the ruling only relates to advertisements for the calendar that were released in November and December last year. Ryanair hopes to sell the remaining few hundred calendars in the coming weeks. Calendar stars: The stewardesses pictured in their beachwear and heels . Ryanair’s Robin Kiely said: 'We have instructed our lawyers to appeal this ruling regarding last year’s cabin crew charity calendar, which raised more than £84,000 for a Polish charity, the TVN Foundation, to help sick children in Poland. 'This case and ruling only relates to specific adverts run in November and December 2012 and has no effect on Ryanair’s continuing charity work or our current 2014 cabin crew charity calendar.'","The airline has been releasing the calendar every year since 2008 .

"Kim Kardashian may be one of the most sought-after women in the world - but one man can't stay far enough away from the reality TV star. Retail assistant Mike Amess has an unusual phobia: he is absolutely petrified of the Kardashian family. He breaks out in a cold sweat whenever he sees or hears the famous family and says the sight of a semi-naked Kim even makes him vomit with disgust. Mike says that his phobia has got worse since Kim's fame skyrocketed and his fear now extends to the whole Kardashian family . Mike breaks out in a cold sweat whenever he sees or hears the famous family and says the sight of a semi-naked Kim even makes him vomit with disgust . The 24-year-old from Exeter explains, 'Just hearing the sound of the Kardashians' nasal voices or catching a glimpse of them on screen makes me feel nauseous and shaky. 'My hands get clammy, my breathing gets heavier and I start sweating. Sometimes, I get teary and want to retch.' Mike, who is gay, says his fear of the Kardashians started when he watched Kim's now notorious sex tape at the age of seventeen. Mike says, 'I was raised Catholic and growing up, I tried to repress my sexuality and deny that I was gay. 'Loads of the boys at school were going on about how good Kim Kardashian's sex tape was. I thought I'd give it a watch in the hope it would turn me on. 'I downloaded the video and watched it secretly in my bedroom. But the sight of Kim writhing around with her huge bum and the sound of her horrible high-pitched wailing repulsed me. 'I really wanted to be aroused by her so I kept watching it but she made me feel more and more upset. Mike's most recent ordeal saw him throw up after accidentally seeing Kanye West's music video, 'Bound 2' (pictured in the background), which features a topless Kim straddling the singer on a motorbike . 'By the end of the tape, I had burst into tears. The experience left me terrified and I never wanted to see Kim's face again. 'I have come to terms with my homosexuality now but my dread towards her has never left.' Mike says that his phobia has got worse since Kim's fame skyrocketed and his fear now extends to the whole Kardashian family. He explains, 'Kim and her sisters look and sound so similar - they're a mess. They make my stomach churn, I hate it. 'I dislike everything about them, especially their physical appearance. I don't understand how anyone could find them attractive. 'I can't stand their voices either. They're so whiny and shrill - it really gets under my skin.' The Kardashians' prominence in the media means that Mike's phobia blights his everyday life. Mike says his friends tease him about his reaction to the family and his fear has even cost him a relationship . 'It's impossible to get away from Kim, let alone her whole family. Every website or magazine you read has them plastered all over. 'I really enjoy reading the news but if I see Kim on the cover of a newspaper or a big picture of her across a website, I won't go near it. Mike has never sought medical help as he is embarrassed of his condition . 'It makes life really difficult. Sometimes, I miss out on a lot of important news or celebrity gossip because I have to avoid anything which features the Kardashians.' Mike's most recent ordeal saw him throw up after accidentally seeing Kanye West's racy music video, 'Bound 2', which features a topless Kim straddling the singer on a motorbike. He says, 'One day, I was lazing about on the sofa in front of the TV. I was skipping through music channels and that video came on. 'Seeing Kim naked, with her boobs bouncing about like that brought back memories of that horrendous sex tape. It was like reliving that incident all over again. 'Before I knew it, I was sweating like a pig and throwing up. When I hear 'Bound 2' on the radio now, I have to switch the station immediately.' Mike's fear of the Kardashians has also had disastrous effects on his love life and he was forced to break up with a former boyfriend because of it. Mike, who is now single, says, 'A lot of the gay community love the Kardashians so it makes dating tough sometimes. I've been romantically involved with several people who like them and each one of these relationships have ended badly. 'My last boyfriend watched all of their shows and kept up with the celeb gossip surrounding them. He thought the Kardashians were fascinating. 'At first, he found my fear funny and kind of cute. But over time, he wanted to talk about the Kardashians with me and of course, that's not something I was really up for doing. 'We had a big argument once when he demanded to watch the latest episode of 'Keeping up with the Kardashians' whilst I was with him. 'We had a blazing row in which he called my phobia immature and attention-seeking. I ended up storming out of his flat. 'In the end, it became difficult spending time with him and definitely played a role in our break-up.' Despite the daily afflictions of his phobia, Mike has never sought medical help as he is embarrassed of his condition. Mike often goes to extreme lengths to avoid the Kardashians and relies his friends to check magazines and newspapers before he reads them . He explains, 'I don't know how I could face a doctor about it. I can just see them laughing in my face the minute I told them about my fear of the Kardashians. It would be totally mortifying.' Mike often goes to extreme lengths to avoid the Kardashians and relies on the support of his friends. He says, 'I have to get my friends to go through a newspaper or magazine before I read it and rip out any pages which contain pictures of the Kardashians.' Mike says he is constantly mocked by his friends who think his phobia is amusing. He explains, 'Although my mates are supportive, they always make fun of my fear and play practical jokes on me. 'Once, my friend put a picture of Kim Kardashian on his bathroom door so I couldn't go to the loo all night. It was unbearable! 'Another time, one of my mates got drunk at a party and chased after me with a photo of Kim's 'Belfie' on his mobile phone. 'They find it hilarious but they don't realise how traumatic it is for me. I wish I wasn't scared of the Kardashians.' Dr Slaney, a Priory Group Consultant at Priory Hospital Woking, says: 'It is unusual for someone to have this type of phobia. 'The common phobias are social phobia, agoraphobia and fear of spiders, snakes or aircraft flights. 'It is possible to develop a phobia of almost anything. There does not necessarily have to be a well-defined traumatic experience as there has been in this case. 'Usually the main treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy. This helps the person unlearn the unhelpful thinking patterns which are causing them to get so anxious in the relevant situation. 'The patient can be shown practical ways of reducing anxiety when it starts to occur. Avoidance of the situation only makes matters worse and needs to be discouraged. 'It is important that things are done step by step. For example therapy here might start with seeing a picture of the celebrity briefly and learning how to limit the anxiety it causes. Watching a programme with the celebrity in it would be a task towards the end of therapy. 'We only have a snippet of information here. Depending on the full picture, it may be that an antidepressant is appropriate. Antidepressants are all anti-anxiety as well so you do not necessarily have to be clinically depressed to benefit from one. 'Usually discussing the origins of a phobia is not useful. It is a bit like coming upon a car crash and studying the skid marks rather than helping the injured driver. This particular case is unusual. It sounds as if the patient’s own sexuality may be an issue and it probably does need to be discussed.'

"Retired policeman Ian Richardson (pictured) told a libel trial the Plebgate affair was 'trivial nonsense' A retired policeman has described the Plebgate affair as ‘trivial nonsense’ which he could not be bothered to record because he was eating his sandwiches. Ian Richardson told a libel trial yesterday that it was merely a ‘quirky incident’ involving ‘a gentleman on a bike who had the hump’. The former police marksman was on duty in Downing Street when Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell allegedly called officers ‘f****** plebs’. He did not hear the former chief whip use the ‘toxic phrase’, but was given an account of what happened moments later by colleague PC Toby Rowland. Asked why he did not write a full account of the conversation, Mr Richardson replied: ‘I was eating my sandwiches and I couldn’t be a**** to write too much more – laziness. 'It was a trivial nonsense incident. It wasn’t a murder scene where tape was being put up.’ Mr Richardson said the confrontation turned into a ‘Mexican stand-off’ after his colleagues refused to allow Mr Mitchell to cycle through the main Downing Street gate. He told the High Court yesterday: ‘I heard Toby say, “please don’t swear at me sir”. I said, “Hello, I think it’s going off over there”.’ He said his team tried to track down members of the public who allegedly witnessed the incident. When asked why, he said: ‘I was anxious to prove that we had been decent, honourable officers that night.’ Earlier Pc Rowland, the only officer who claims he heard Mr Mitchell use the word ‘pleb’, was accused of inventing his account of the incident. The police marksman claims ‘several’ members of the public heard the MP’s outburst and were ‘visibly shocked’. PC Toby Rowland (pictured left) denied inventing the words 'f****** plebs' attributed to Andrew Mitchell (right) as he cycled out of the front gates of Downing Street. Both are pictured arriving at the High Court in London . But James Price QC, representing Mr Mitchell, accused Pc Rowland of inventing his account to justify giving the MP a warning under the Public Order Act. Mr Price said the officer’s witness statement was ‘a carefully constructed account’. In a written submission to the court, Mr Price added: ‘Pc Rowland, either on his own, or with the encouragement of others, fabricated the toxic phrases, lied about seeing visibly shocked members of the public, and falsely claimed to have been alarmed by what Mr Mitchell said. ‘In other words, he lied about what was said, where it was said, what he saw and how he felt.’ David Davis MP (right) and Mr Mitchell's wife Sharon Bennett (left) arrived at the High Court with him today . The Scotland Yard officer, a policeman of 22 years, replied: ‘No, the evidence I have given is the truth.’ Mr Mitchell is suing News Group Newspapers, publishers of The Sun, over the allegation that, after being refused entry through a Downing Street gate on his bike, he told officers: ‘Best you learn your f****** place. You don’t run this f****** government, you’re f****** plebs.’ Mr Mitchell denies this, but admits saying ‘I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us’ after officers refused to open the gate in September 2012. News Group Newspapers argues its article was substantially true. Pc Rowland is suing the MP for suggesting that he made up the allegations. The case continues.

The post had been retweeted over 3,000 times and was picked up by media outlets around the world, however Sacco remained completely unaware of it all because she was in the air. The blonde publicist was pictured arriving in Cape Town looking shocked and talking on her phone. Moments later the offending Tweet and Sacco's Twitter account disappeared. A spokeswoman for the company has now confirmed Sacco has indeed been sacked. Flying into the storm: This photo, snapped by Twitter user Zac_R, was taken as Justine Sacco got off a 12 hour flight at Cape Town airport after arriving from London. The PR representative would have just been discovering the furor her racist Tweet had created while she was in the air . Justine Sacco has no idea her offensive tweet made the news because she is on a flight to Africa . Career suicide: IAC says that they will take 'appropriate action' against the tweet sent by Justine Sacco (pictured above in shots from her Facebook account) with the high powered executive likely to lose her job . 'There is no excuse for the hateful statements that have been made and we condemn them unequivocally,' a rep told The Daily Beast. 'The offensive comment does not reflect the views and values of IAC. 'We take this issue very seriously, and we have parted ways with the employee in question.' Sacco was blasted for being 'outrageous' and . 'inappropriate', with titles like 'Worst Tweet of the Year' stacking up . against her. Despite deleting the Tweet, the damage had been done in those 12 hours she was flying. Before confirming they had fired her, IAC released an earlier statement condemning Sacco's behavior as 'outrageous and offensive'. 'This is an outrageous, offensive . comment that does not reflect the views and values of IAC. Unfortunately, the employee in question is unreachable on an . international flight, but this is a very serious matter and we are . taking appropriate action,' a representative from IAC told the . International Business Times. Sacco landed in Africa on British Airways Flight 43 about 11.30pm Friday and one can only imagine the number of angry responses she would have recieved once turning her cell phone on. One man, Zac R, Tweeted that he went to the airport specifically to see her and took photos of her arrival. The Cape Town local also claimed to have spoken to Sacco's father, who is South African. The hashtag '#hasjustinelandedyet' was trending on Twitter around the world at the time as thousands awaited Sacco's response. The Twittersphere was fascinated with the fact that as all the drama she caused unfolded, Sacco was blissfully unaware of any it up in the air. In February 2012 Sacco had Tweeted: 'I had a sex dream about an autistic kid last night.' Then about 12 hours before the racist Tweet, she wrote: 'Weird German Dude: You're in first class. It's 2014. Get some deodorant' -Inner monologue as I inhale BO. Thank god for pharmaceuticals.' However it was 'joke' about Africa and AIDS that caused the commotion. Twitter user Stephanie Be wrote in response: 'WOW! Reinforce the ignorant American stereotype much?' John M. Becker tweeted: 'Are you even real?!? This is utterly ghastly on so many levels.' Josephine Baker wrote: 'listen, homegirl is about to be FIRED.' Huffington . Post stated that there is a possibility that the young PR executive's . account may have been hacked. However that is unlikely as her twitter profile has a number . of other tweets that may also be deemed offensive. Sacco wrote wrote: 'I can't be fired for things I say while intoxicated right?' Sacco also wrote: 'I like animals, but when it's this cold out I'll skin one myself for the fur' and tweeted the comment directly at PETA, a famous animal rights organization. The Tulane alum also tweeted: 'Last day of hurricane season. Can't wait for evacuations next year.' Ironically enough, Tulane is located in New Orleans, a city in which more than half of the population is black, according to infoplease.com. New Orleans also suffered tremendously after Hurricane Katrina decimated homes, took several lives, and wrecked the local economy. One Twitter user took it so far as to create a fake profile for Sacco named LOL Justine Sacco. Her Byline reads, 'PR Disaster. Racist idiot. All-around awful.' One of the mock tweets reads, 'I think the lady across the aisle is clicking at me. I'm sorry...I don't speak Kwanzaa LOL #whitesanta #longestflightever #haveilandedyet' Another mock tweet reads, '@Paperboy415 . Been downing #WhiteRussians all flight in support of #Sochi2014! Seat 5A . sent me a Johnnie Walker Black, but I sent it back!' Joke's on her: Sacco's tweet inspired twitter users like this one to make a mock page dedicated to her racist comments . You most certainly can: This tweet Sacco wrote in January may have been a self fulfilling prophecy . What a mess: Sacco will have some explaining to do for her sloppy behavior on twitter . The Mail Online tried contacting IAC's media relations department, and since the contact listed on their website was Sacco herself, no one was available for comment. Upon looking at the IAC website again, her name has been removed and has been replaced with 'corporate communications.' The voice mail which previously gave out her personal cell phone number for media inquiries with a strict deadline, has also been changed. The reason Sacco is traveling to Africa is still unknown, but chances are that Sacco won't get the warmest Christmas welcome. According to dosomething.org out of the 34 million people in the world who have HIV, 69 percent live in sub-Saharan Africa. There are around 23.8 million people in Africa with AIDS. AIDS (Acquired immune deficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is caused by the Virus HIV ( Human immunodeficiency syndrome). It can be transmitted via sexual intercourse, blood to blood contact, or childbirth. HIV greatly lowers the human immune system making it easier for those infected to carry fatal diseases .","Justine Sacco has been sacked following the furor her racist and insensitive Tweet caused after it went viral .

"Roy Hodgson has been taken to task by some psycho-babble fitness guru for failing to understand that Raheem Sterling, at coming up to 20, needs more rest between football games than stars just a few months older than he is. What nonsense. The England manager’s only real mistake was sending on Sterling as a second half substitute in Estonia and thereby giving a cap to a player who had announced himself too tired to give his all for his country. Raheem Sterling (right) told England boss Roy Hodgson that he was too tired to start against Estonia . Hodgson started Sterling (second right) on the bench for England's 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifying win in Estonia . If Sterling was being that precious he ought not to have been granted an honour which should be deemed priceless. The trolling to which this young man has been subjected on the internet has been unpleasant, unnecessary and in some cases downright sick. However, he did need reminding that it is a privilege to pull on the England shirt and that great players do not pick and choose their international appearances. Sterling (centre) came on as a second half substitute for Jordan Henderson against Estonia in Tallinn . Of the players England used against Estonia, only Gary Cahill has played more minutes this season than Raheem Sterling... Gary Cahill 1164 minutes played . RAHEEM STERLING 1079 mins . Jack Wilshere 1064 mins . Jordan Henderson 1035 mins . Calum Chambers 995 mins . Joe Hart 990 mins . Leighton Baines 990 mins . Phil Jagielka 919 mins . Danny Welbeck 836 mins . Wayne Rooney 758 mins . Fabian Delph 741 mins . Adam Lallana 538 mins . Paul Scholes, a surprisingly outspoken commentator after spending his distinguished playing career saying next to nothing, performed that service by confirming that he would never have failed to turn out for England unless he was really sick or injured. Pele’s record talks louder than words. At the age of 17 he shook off the injurious effects of an arduous club season with Santos to lead Brazil to 1958 World Cup glory in Sweden with six goals in four matches, including a hat-trick in the semi and a brace in the Final. He then collapsed with exhaustion at the final whistle but the effects of his exertions did not prevent him going on to score more than a thousand goals in a career overflowing with honours, including more World Cups. But then not even the greatest footballer of all time was pampered in those days. And it is difficult to resist the conclusion that it is the money which spoils today’s young players. If our Premier League princelings were not banking hundreds of thousands of pounds a week would any of them even consider pulling out of an England match? Paul Scholes (centre), training here in his Man United days, claimed rest days should be for older players . Pele collapsed with exhaustion at the end of the 1958 World Cup final after scoring a brace for Brazil . Pele, aged just 17, scored six goals in four matches at the World Cup following a gruelling season with Santos . Not, I would suggest, if they still needed international fame to cement their  fortune. Also - and never mind that it risks abuse from the 'twitterers' for saying this – it is worth drawing to Master Sterling’s attention that younger men than he fight and die for this country. The war-zone is no place for feeling a mite too tired for action – and the rewards are nothing like as enormous. With Sterling volunteering for England duty in the Under-21 European championships next year, it does seem he has got the message. So when Hodgson bumps into Brendan Rodgers at QPR this very Sunday, I trust he will not be making any apologies. Liverpool’s manager is never slow to make excuses for his players. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (left) is set to meet Hodgson at Loftus Road on Sunday for the clash with QPR . Like so many, he puts the interests of his club first. He can hardly be blamed for doing so, especially in this case where there are unsettling suggestions that Sterling may already be fidgeting for a move elsewhere. But that does not mean that Rodgers paints the full picture. Sterling is a precocious talent and I for one will be disappointed if he does not develop into a vibrant force for both Liverpool and England. Yes, he may need nurturing to some extent – but not over-protecting. Since England could pretty well qualify for Euro 2016 even if they failed to turn up for the rest of their group matches, there was no need to send him on in the second half last Sunday. Better to have sent him home to bed. Sterling returned to  Liverpool's Melwood training ground on Tuesday ahead of the Premier League's return . As Wayne Rooney closes in on Sir Bobby Charlton’s record of 49 England goals, there are many who would begrudge him usurping such a legend of the beautiful game. So it is worth putting on record that Charlton is not one them. As a director of Manchester United, Sir Bobby is a frequent and inspirational visitor to the Old Trafford dressing room and has struck up a warm relationship with Rooney. Wayne Rooney closed in on Sir Bobby Charlton's scoring record of 49 England goals by netting against Estonia . Charlton, pictured with Rooney in 2010, has struck up a warm relationship with the Manchester United striker . 1) Sir Bobby Charlton - 49 goals (106 caps) 2) Gary Lineker - 48 (80 caps) (Own goals - 47) 3) Jimmy Greaves - 44 (57 caps) 4) Wayne Rooney - 43 (99 caps) 5) Michael Owen - 40 (89 caps) 6) Naf Lofthouse - 30 (33 caps) =6) Alan Shearer - 30 (63 caps) =6) Tom Finney - 30 (76 caps) 9) Vivian Woodward - 29 (23 caps) =9) Frank Lampard - 29 (106 caps) Sunday’s penalty in Estonia brought Rooney to within six goals of that magic number and Charlton will be applauding if he closes the gap still further when England meet Slovenia at Wembley on November 15. And why not? Memory may insist that Jimmy Greaves and Gary Lineker – who are also in the throes of being overtaken - were sharper goalscorers but there should be no denying the magnitude of Rooney’s impending achievement. Not that he should count those chickens yet. As Lineker discovered when he missed the penalty from which he should have equalled Charlton’s record, there can be many a slip between opportunity and delivery. Nor do statistics alone assert who is the greater. The circumstances in which those goals are scored brings its own perspective. Not until his third tournament did Rooney score his so-far solitary goal at the World Cup finals – that mere consolation tap-in during defeat by Uruguay this summer. Jimmy Greaves and Gary Lineker are third and second respectively in the list of England's all-time goalscorers . Rooney celebrates after scoring his so-far solitary goal at a World Cup - against Uruguay during the summer . Bobby Charlton shoots and scores against Portugal in England's 2-1 semi-final victory at Wembley in 1966 . Charlton celebrates and runs with arms upraised as England progressed to the 1966 World Cup final . Charlton scored three in England’s winning of the 1966 World Cup, two of them against Portugal in the semi-final. His England record is one of the longest-standing in world sport – at 44 years and five months, so far. Given today’s context of so many more matches against tiny football countries – some of which used to be but corners of the giant Russia against whom Charlton played – Rooney will have to score plenty more than 50 if his record and stature are to stand the test of him. But like Sir Bobby, we wish him well. VIDEO Sterling rest row rumbles on .","Raheem Sterling started England's Euro qualifier with Estonia on the bench after complaining he was too tired .

"The bell at ringside has tolled for the last time this year, thereby ringing in this column’s awards for Anno Domini 2014. A Merry Christmas to fight fans everywhere – and many a Happy Boxing Day. BOXER OF THE YEAR - Carl Froch . Froch fought only once these 12 months but what a night it was. Upwards of 80,000 at Wembley – the biggest post-war boxing crowd in Britain – saw the Nottingham Cobra deliver the punch which rang out around the world. No controversy this time as Froch put a devastating end to a second successful defence of his world super-middleweight title against dashing young pretender George Groves. A case could be argued for Kell Brook after the away win over American Shaw Porter which gave him a world welterweight title. Hearty congratulations, also, to Andy Lee for his knockout world middleweight title win over Matt Korobov. But it was Froch who carried British boxing to a new, wider, younger, crossover audience in spectacular style. KNOCKOUT OF THE YEAR - Carl Froch . See above. Carl Froch secured a thrilling win over George Groves in a fight that captured the imagination of the public . VIDEO Froch v Groves II highlights . Froch prevailed in  an eagerly-anticipated rematch between the pair in front of over 80,000 fans at Wembley . Froch landed a devastating punch on Groves that left the challenger unable to continue at Wembley . WORLD BOXER OF THE YEAR - Gennady Golovkin . Golovkin, the most feared middleweight on the planet, inflicted massive knockouts on three challengers for his world titles in this one year. Osumanu Adama, Daniel Geale and Marco Antonio Rubio all fell in 1914 to the Kazakh hammer, who now boasts 28 KOs in a perfect record of 31 wins. Golovkin has not been taken the distance for almost seven years and now holds the highest knock-out ratio – 90 per cent – in the history of the classic middleweight division. Good luck to our Martin Murray in Monte Carlo on February 21. Gennady Golovkin took his record to 28 knockouts from a perfect 31 wins in his career . FIGHT OF THE YEAR - Billy Joe Saunders vs Chris Eubank Jnr . Two brilliant British prospects for world titles had the courage to take each other on early in their careers and delivered a thriller in which Saunders claimed a valid decision but Son of Eubank enhanced his future, also. Not only a roller-coaster ride but vibrant proof that there is no crime in losing. Chris Eubank Jnr and Billy Joe Saunders produced a thrilling contest when they met at the Excel . Eubank and Saunders had been rivals for a while, and the latter won on a split division in November . STILL….THE No 1 POUND-FOR-POUND - Floyd Mayweather . Not a vintage year for the Money man but he still minted a pair of hard-currency wins over the pesky, hard-punching Marcos Maidana to retain his status as both the best boxer on the planet and the pay-per-view king. Floyd Mayweather extended his perfect record to 47 wins from 47 contests in 2014 . Mayweather twice got the better of tough Argentine Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas . COMMAND PERFORMANCE OF THE YEAR - Manny Pacquiao . Pacquiao looked virtually back to his lightning, thunderous best in Macau as he hounded a young world champion, New York’s Chris Algieri, around the ring, decking him six times on his way to a modern record points victory by 18 points, 120-102. Bring on PacMan v Money Man. Manny Pacquiao dominated Chris Algieri when they met in Macau on November 23 . VIRTUOSO PERFORMANCE OF THE YEAR - Amir Khan . Having promised a statement against Devon Alexander, Khan delivered not only that but a masterclass of hand and foot speed. The boy from Bolton came of age in Las Vegas, not losing a round as he raced into the Mayweather-Pacquiao sweepstakes. Amir Khan produced a dazzling display in beating Devon Alexander in Las Vegas in December . Khan is targeting a fight against Mayweather after his impressive victory over Alexander .

Eddie Hearn at a press conference to launch Froch's rematch against Groves at Wembley . LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD - Bernard Hopkins . Already, at 49, the oldest boxer ever to hold a world title, the former Executioner who re-dubbed himself The Alien came within a month and one week of wearing the light-heavyweight crown at 50 when he faced Sergey Kovalev in Atlantic City this November. Although he lost Hopkins still achieved what many have not, by taking the Krusher from Russia the distance. For a life heart-warmingly redeemed from a Philadelphia prison as a teenager, we salute the grand old man of the prize-ring. Bernard Hopkins came within a month and a week of wearing the light-heavyweight world title aged 50 .","Carl Froch is boxer of the year for his performance against George Groves .

"Bernard Hopkins was born nine years before the Rumble in the Jungle, the 40th anniversary of which Muhammad Ali and George Foreman celebrated last week. Hopkins took time out from a fledgling career of mugging grown-ups and being stabbed three times himself in the crime-ridden streets of Philadelphia to watch film of the legalised fist fight beamed into US cinemas from distant Zaire. Just eight troubled years after Ali famously knocked out the hitherto indestructible Foreman, Hopkins was sentenced to 18 years in jail for nine felony convictions. Bernard Hopkins, boxing's oldest ever world champion, is two months shy of his 50th birthday . Hopkins comfortably outpointed Beibut Shumenov to retain his IBF and WBA world titles in April . Hopkins' victory over Shumenov was his 55th in a career that has seen him fight 65 times . Upon being paroled six years later, at the age of 23, he replied to a taunt from the prison warden who predicted he would see him again soon by saying: ‘I ain’t ever coming back here.’ Hopkins had identified boxing as the means for reforming his life. Now it appears he has discovered the secret of eternal youth. In Atlantic City on Saturday night Hopkins will contest the 66th fight of his seemingly ever-lasting career. Already, at 49, he is boxing’s oldest world champion of all time. If he wins in the Boardwalk Hall this coming weekend he will be a reigning world champion when he turns 50 on January 15. But not for him a soft-touch opponent to help him make more history. At this age when many sportsmen are reaching for the carpet slippers and regaling their grandchildren with tales of glories past, Hopkins is taking on one of the most devastating punchers in the hardest of all games. Not for nothing is Sergey Kovalev nicknamed Krusher. Nathan Cleverly, who lost his world title when he was flattened by the Russian knockout machine in Cardiff 15 months ago, testifies: ‘This man has serious power. He hits harder than anyone I’ve fought. I fear he will stop Hopkins and end his career.’ Hopkins has re-styled himself as The Alien as a testament to his ability to box into his 50th year . Kovalev has only one minor blip on his record – a technical draw. Of his 25 victories, all but two have been inflicted inside the distance and only two others went beyond the fourth round. Yet Hopkins has hand-picked this menace for this iconic moment, in which he intends adding Kovalev’s WBO light-heavyweight title to the WBA and IBF belts which he already wears around his fat-free waist and six-pack stomach. Alright, we have heard plenty down these remarkable years about the clean-living, strict dieting, hard-training regime to which Hopkins adheres, not only when preparing for fights but every day of his life. OK, he rarely if ever weighs more than a pound or two above the 12-and-a-half stone light-heavyweight limit and forswears hard liquor, cigarettes and late nights. But Kovalev? Hopkins will soon be half a century old, for heaven’s sake. The Krusher is 21 years his junior. And yet, and yet... When this match was made the first instinct of most of us, like Cleverly, was to start praying Hopkins would not be badly hurt. And yet... this is not only the oldest but the wiliest of world champions. Kovalev trains during a media workout as he prepares to face Hopkins on Saturday . Kovalev has proved himself to be one of the hardest hitters in boxing . And while he talks about his Spartan lifestyle keeping him young, he has to have an intellectual reason for choosing Kovalev. The alternative was an equally big-money battle with another mighty puncher, one of whose victims is coming up to a battle of Britain rematch with Cleverly in Liverpool on November 22. Adonis Stevenson made almost as short work of Tony Bellew as Kovalev did of Cleverly and Hopkins was close to agreeing a unification fight with Canada’s WBC champion. So why, all of a sudden, Kovalev? Hopkins, talkative man though he is, keeps his counsel. Adonis also spells danger but Hopkins prefers the Krusher. Could it be he has worked out that Kovalev is the inferior technical boxer of the two and less likely, also, to have the patience to unravel the defensive labyrinth and complex traps which Hopkins will bring to the argument? It is reasonable to suspect as much. Oscar De La Hoya, the president of Golden Boy promotions in which Hopkins is a stakeholder, suggests that his business partner is ‘more powerful, just as fast and even more clever’ than back when he dubbed himself The Executioner. Hopkins has changed his nickname to The Alien and Kovalev says: ‘I’m going to hit him so hard I will send him back to Mars.’ Sergey Kovalev dethroned Nathan Cleverly as world champion last year in a destructive fight . Cleverly was in a bad way when he was stopped in the fourth round by the hard-hitting Russian . Six years ago, shortly before he retired, our own legend Joe Calzaghe outpointed the older and seemingly ageing Hopkins. He marvels that the man is still boxing and says: ‘Kovalev will have to catch Bernard if he is to make his power count. Although I have to say it will be hard for a 49-year-old to keep away from trouble for the full 12 rounds.’ Don’t bet against Hopkins doing it. Don’t count out another miracle of the aged, another blow on behalf of the grey community. Don’t write off the prospect of one more mesmerising, time-defying victory by decision for the grand old man of the ring. Fifty is a dangerous age. But for whom? Hopkins v Kovalev will be televised live on BoxNation late Saturday night. We are asked to believe that the proprietors of strip clubs in Las Vegas have requested that the local cops help them ban Floyd Mayweather. This is the unlikeliest story of the week. The allegation is that some pole dancers were upset at being molested by the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world. Now while Mayweather is no angel, this one smacks of the ridiculous. Check out the video of him on one of those nights out with the lads. He is there to be observed throwing hundred dollar bills at those naked bodies like so much confetti. So affronted are the girls by all that harassment that they can be seen… smiling broadly. The first meeting of Ricky Hatton and Kostya Tszyu since their world title epic nine years ago has provided on object lesson in manners to today’s aspiring champions. The Hitman is in Sydney promoting one of his stable of fighters, Sergey Rabchenko, in next week’s light-middleweight title eliminator against former three-time world champion Anthony Mundine. Hatton and Tszyu, the formidable Russo-Aussie he forced to relinquish his world light-welterweight title by retiring at the end of the 11th round in the Manchester Arena, embraced each other warmly. Both recalled the punishing ferocity of their clash, Hatton saying: ‘This second meeting is a lot less painful than when we hit each other with so many heavy shots.’ Ricky Hatton and Kostya Tszyu met up in Sydney, nine years after their ferocious fight in Manchester . Hatton throws big right at Tszyu during their world title fight at the MEN Arena in Manchester . Tszyu gave as good as he got for most of the fight but failed to come out for the 12th and final round . Hatton celebrates winning the IBF world title with his promoter Frank Warren . Tszyu, who retired at the end of the greatest victory in Hatton’s career and is now a Moscow businessman, said: ‘Thank you, Ricky, for making me realise I had to find something in my life other than boxing.’ Hatton added: ‘It was a wonderful fight but the way we conducted ourselves was just as important.’ Gentlemen of the ring circa 2014, please take note. Another rival for the attention of the combat sport audience arrives on Channel 5 on Sunday week, November 16. As the Ultimate Fighting Championship continues to expand outside the US, so Bellator promotions invade the UK market with a show which features a battle between mixed martial art legends Tito Ortiz and Stephan Bonnar. Channel 5 is the only terrestrial TV outlet for boxing in this country. So the old game will be listening carefully when Bellator chief executive Scott Coker says ‘we will become a fixture for MMA fans in the UK.’ But so will Dana White of the UFC, currently the Octagon’s main counter-attraction to the prize-ring.","Bernard Hopkins is already the oldest world champion in history .

"Like many of those facing a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, Barry Rudd was willing to try anything to be well again. The property developer from Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, had been an avid three-times-a-week gym-goer when, in 2004, he was given the devastating news. Just 53 at the time, he had started feeling tired, and his foot began dragging when he walked. After being referred to a neurologist in June 2005, the diagnosis was finally given: primary progressive multiple sclerosis. MS sufferer Barry Rudd, pictured with his wife Lorraine at their home in Cambridgeshire, who has been refused the cannabis spray Sativex . One of the more uncommon forms of the disease, affecting only 15 per cent of sufferers, it causes a steady decline as symptoms worsen. The condition, in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system, slowly robs sufferers of their balance, movement and speech, causing stiffness, numbness, insomnia, pain and exhaustion. There was little doctors could do to help Barry and he was drawn by desperation into the murky world of alternative medicine – paying more than £20,000 for bogus treatments in Holland and Poland that had no effect on his condition. Finally, in late 2010 he saw an article online about a new drug called Sativex. The oral spray is derived from the cannabis plant – but without any of the associated dangers or side effects – and works by dampening down the over-activity in the nervous system that damages the muscles, inhibiting movement. ‘I mentioned it to my neurologist, who said, “You can’t get it in this area. If you want it you have to buy it privately.” So he gave me a private prescription. I went to my local chemist who charged me £550.’ The supply lasted just six weeks, but the effects were almost immediate. ‘Within a few days I could feel the benefit and after a couple of weeks my symptoms were almost completely gone. I’d say I was 80 per cent better,’ says Barry. But, unable to get an NHS prescription, . after three months Barry could no longer afford the treatment. His . symptoms flooded back. To add to his misery, he found that a few miles . away at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, MS patients with symptoms . similar to his are being prescribed the drug. The cannabis spray Sativex hasn't been assessed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence so funding decisions for the drug are not uniform across the NHS . According to Dr Willy Notcutt, consultant in pain management at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth, Sativex can not only alleviate existing problems but could hold back the progression of MS. ‘Sativex is licensed only for the relief of spasticity [tightness in the muscles that affect movement] and found effective in half of cases,’ he says. ‘Many patients have discovered what Barry did: it also relieves other symptoms, such as chronic insomnia.’ A major review of trials last December concluded there was insufficient evidence to warrant Sativex’s routine use with MS, yet Dr Notcutt is convinced of its effectiveness. ‘We found that patents have substantially improved sleep,’ he says. ‘Studies on animals have shown some reduction in disease progression. We know it has an effect on protecting the nervous system.’ The problems have arisen because of the way certain clinical commissioning groups (CCGs – the bodies that have replaced primary care trusts) do their sums. A single bottle costing £125 will contain 90 sprays. The drug has not yet been assessed by the NHS guidance body, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence – which means funding decisions are not uniform across CCGs. The result is that it is not being prescribed widely. Earlier this year, British charity the MS Society found that just two in 100 patients were using a symptom-reducing treatment such as Sativex. Laura Weir, Head of Policy and Campaigns at the MS Society, says: ‘We know that Sativex is not being prescribed in some areas and in other areas it is. We think this is down to CCGs making their own decisions at a local level.’ In 2011 the Midlands Therapeutic Review and Advisory Committee – an independent advisory group that provides guidance on pharmaceutical treatments in the West Midlands – recommended against prescribing Sativex, stating there was ‘inadequate evidence for efficacy and/or safety’. Weir insists: ‘Their decision, which has triggered similar ones elsewhere, is based on inaccurate analysis of the data, and on the cost impact of the treatment rather than cost effectiveness. We wrote to them to highlight this but the committee has not reviewed the policy. ‘Prescription rates for Sativex in the UK are low. It is a licensed treatment for MS and has undergone extensive clinical testing that found it to be safe and effective. We strongly believe eligible people should be given the opportunity to try treatments that could benefit them.’ Barry turned to a nurse for advice. ‘She told me other patients buy cannabis and mix it into cakes.’He refuses to consider this option. ‘If there’s a drug that’s legal – Sativex – and that works for me, why can’t I get it on the NHS? The future for me looks grim.’ Dr Notcutt is equally angry. He says: ‘When you find patients, as I have, whose lives are transformed by this drug you’re left wondering: are we prepared as a society to leave people in often agonising pain? Or do we provide them with a medicine that might help them?’ THE VIRUS TRIGGER . MS is believed to be genetic – but not necessarily inherited – and triggered by environmental factors such as viruses and a lack of Vitamin D. Only two per cent of Britain’s 100,000 MS sufferers have a parent with the disease.","Barry Rudd was just 53 when he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis .

The two clubs settled on a fee to free Pardew from his Newcastle contract, which still had six years left to run. The original release figure was set at £5million, but with Palace unwilling to the meet that price, a lower fee was agreed. A figure of £2m has been quoted, but Newcastle insist the fee was higher. Pardew had made it clear to Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, who is in Barbados, that he wanted to return to Palace and the Toon chief agreed to compromise. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alan Pardew singing his heart out as a Crystal Palace player . Alan Pardew is set to be appointed as the new Crystal Palace manager . Pardew applauds the home crowd after Newcastle's 3-2 win against Everton at St James' Park . Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, who is currently in Barbados, will have the final say on Pardew's future . The Newcastle fans wanted Pardew out after a difficult start to the 2014-15 Premier League campaign . Newcastle supporters hold up a 'Pardew is a muppet' banner ahead of their team's Premier League clash against Stoke in April . Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club . Pardew made 128 league appearances between 1987 and 1991, scoring eight goals. The highlight of his time at Selhurst Park, however, was the FA Cup run in the 1989-90 season. Pardew was one of the 'Fab Four' (with Mark Bright, Gary O'Reilly and Andy Gray) and scored the winner against Liverpool in that memorable 4-3 semi-final victory at Villa Park (the other three also netted in that match). The Eagles pushed Manchester United all the way in the Wembley final, drawing 3-3 in the first match, but lost 1-0 in the replay. Pardew played every minute of both matches. Those linked with the Newcastle job included club captain Fabricio Coloccini, former Stoke and Palace boss Tony Pulis, Derby’s Steve McClaren and Eddie Howe of Bournemouth. Pardew ducked the post match press conference after Newcastle's dramatic 3-2 victory against Everton on Sunday and has agreed to move to Selhurst Park once the clubs reached a deal. The 53-year-old boss has faced various campaigns calling for his resignation or dismissal by sections of Newcastle supporters throughout his turbulent reign at the club. Ashley, who did not attend the victory over Everton on Sunday, has been plotting his next move from his holiday retreat. The billionaire is wary of the upheaval when his manager quits the club and will also need to find a replacement prepared to work under his demanding ways. Pardew, who has a property in Surrey a short distance from Palace’s Beckenham HQ, is known to be frustrated after being told at a Newcastle transfer meeting four weeks ago that there would be no money to spend in January. Instead there is the possibility that Moussa Sissoko will leave in January after Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain declared an interest in the France midfielder. Ashley has agreed to reach a compromise with Eagles chief Steve Parish rather than demand the full £5m . Moussa Sissoko could leave in January after Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain declared an interest . Pardew played a prominent role in Palace's recording of Glad All Over in the build up to the 1990 FA Cup final . Crystal Palace vs Newcastle - Wednesday February 11, 8pm . Newcastle are ninth in the Barclays Premier League following the victory over Everton and Ashley is happy with the team’s progress following their poor start to the season. Pardew, who wanted to progress and challenge for honours, expected Ashley to make funds available to strengthen the team. Instead the Newcastle owner, who had an excellent relationship with his manager, appears content with the current squad. Pardew, who joined Palace in the Eighties and went on to score the winner in the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool in 1990, is currently at his family home in Surrey. Newcastle United can confirm that Crystal Palace have made a formal approach requesting permission to speak to Alan Pardew in relation to their vacant managerial position. Crystal Palace have offered compensation at a level whereby Alan has now been permitted to speak to them. As a result of this development today (Monday), Alan will not be at training on Tuesday. Training will be the responsibility of assistant manager John Carver. The club will make a further announcement in due course.

"It has taken even more bravery than is needed to climb into the ring for Amir Khan, as a devout Muslim, to denounce the extremist barbarity which has now brought slaughter to the streets of Paris in the perverted name of religion. It required greater courage still for this British hero of Pakistani origin to travel to strife-torn Peshawar to help inspire the rebuilding of the school in which 132 children were among those massacred by militant Islamist gunmen. All sane citizens of this country should be deeply grateful to a young public figure of such risky prominence for so fearlessly distancing himself, and by association much of his Muslim community, from terror and atrocity. Amir Khan (right) hands a cricket bat over to a Pakistani child in December after a shooting at a school . Khan (second right) prays with soldiers after 134 children were killed at a school in Peshawar . People gathered around candles and pens at the Place de la Republique in Paris in support of the victims after the terrorist attack on a French satirical cartoon magazine . So why, despite the example which Khan began setting as a teenager at the time of the London Underground bombing, does his voice remain so isolated in the world of sport in our supposedly United Kingdom? As the threat moves ever closer to these shores with French cartoonists, journalists, police and democracy itself being gunned down by fanatical jihadists, what do we hear from Khan’s fellow athletes? Silence. Even from his Muslim brothers in sport. Scour their Twitter handles and what do you find about this assault on our way of life from Mo Farah, the Somali-born runner who was decorated by the Queen for winning a couple of gold medals at the London Olympics, or Moeen Ali - the cricketer who, like Khan, is of Pakistani extract but who took to the field for England wearing pro-Palestinian wrist-bands. Boxer Khan has positioned himself as a brilliant role model and has spoken out against extremism . Devout Muslim Mo Farah has kept quiet since the shootings in Paris on Wednesday . Nothing that I can find. Nothing about horror in Paris. Nothing about children being massacred in Pakistan, Mr Moeen? Nothing about schoolgirls being abducted and violated in Africa, Mr Farah? Nothing to help Khan raise the standard for British tolerance and understanding to the level of that set by these giants of world sport: . Muhammad Ali, The Greatest: ‘It saddens me that human beings are suffering and dying at the hands of violent extremists. I send my deepest condolences to their families. Islam does not support terrorism.’ Imran Khan, master cricketer now Pakistani presidential candidate: ‘We must unite against such inhumanity to rid our world of terrorism.’ Cricket Moeen Ali, who wore a wristband showing support for Gaza last summer, has also remained silent . One of the terrorists fires at the officer at point-blank range - 12 people were killed in Paris on Wednesday . Not that Messers Farah and Moeen are alone in failing to add their voices to the hundreds of thousands exorcising the right to freedom of expression, for which ten of the staff of the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo and two members of the gendarmerie sacrificed their lives, by proclaiming in French: ‘Je Suis Charlie.’ Where is the condemnation of these monstrous acts from Wayne Rooney, Lewis Hamilton, Rory McIlroy, even from Andy Murray who revealed a modicum of political awareness with his stance on Scottish independence? Do they really not comprehend their power to exert influence for good? Do they not accept that fame and fortune brings responsibility? But then what more might we expect from those who exist in such a privileged bubble that they have nothing to say about whether a convicted but still unrepentant rapist should be allowed to return to life as a role model for football-worshipping youngsters? Comfortable with it or not, there is a parallel to be drawn between carnage in Paris and denial in Oldham. It is to be found in the moral quagmire into which our society is sinking. Khan (left), landing a punch during his victory over Devon Alexander in December, has become a role model . While governments more feeble than Amir Khan wrestle with both their conscience and their fearful dilemma with Islam - good and evil - the queue of advocates for Ched Evans is lengthening. ‘He’s paid for his crime,’ they cry. ‘It’s time to give him a second chance.’ In charitable work, an office, on the buses maybe - but not in football it isn’t. Not when the supporters of this despicable man - at his behest or nor - have so vilely persecuted his victim on social media for so long, hounding her from one false identity to another. Not when his apology for ‘the effects of that night’ is so cravenly qualified by a failure to admit his crime and is so belatedly offered only after his rejection by another football club that it is virtually worthless. Not as the father of his sadly misguided girlfriend funds a legal campaign for a man so wretchedly lacking in remorse that it is hard to see how any father would want his daughter anywhere near Evans, least of all in his bed. Ched Evans, pictured with girlfriend Natasha Massey, has failed to secure a return to football with Oldham . Evans was released from prison in October, with his potential return to football sparking widespread debate . This has been not just character assassination. This has been terrorism of a deeply disturbing, personal order. It is not the Twitter merchants who have been preventing this unpleasant specimen from returning to employment as a footballer. It is his thuggish reluctance to admit to his own wrong-doing. Just as it was not those French cartoonists who provoked the killing of themselves with their lampooning of the Prophet Muhammad, as the political equivalents of the Evans apologists would tell us. It was the radicalisation of young Muslims into ranting, raving, maniacs. Oldham Athletic chief executive Neil Joy (left) and manager Lee Johnson at Boundary Park on Thursday . Should sport join in the taking-of-a-stand against extremist atrocities? Indeed it should, as a daily sports paper in France so poignantly demonstrated. L’Equipe’s front page on the morning after the Paris slaughter was filled by this huge score-line: LIBERTE 0, BARBARITE 12. So just to be clear: I Am Not Ched. Je Suis Charlie.","Devout Muslim boxer Amir Khan has publicly condemned the killing of 12 people in Paris by extremists .

"It is the perfect excuse to raise a glass to a long and active life. Scientists from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in France have shown that resveratrol, the ‘miracle ingredient’ in red wine, extends lifespan and provides an infusion of energy. In this case, worms were the beneficiaries but it is thought that a similar technique could help people live longer. A 'miracle ingredient' found in red wine, called reservatrol, has been found to increase the lifespan of worms by up to 60%. Reservatrol is found in plants such as the Japanese knotweed. The findings, from scientists at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, were published in the Nature journal. They think similar results could be seen in humans . Resveratrol is a natural phenol produced naturally by several plants, especially the roots of the Japanese Knotweed. It is extracted from these plants for commercial reasons and is produced when the plant is under attack by pathogens such as bacteria or fungi. The effects of resveratrol have been studied in various studies. In mouse and rat experiments it was shown to have anticancer, anti-inflammatory, blood sugar-lowering and other beneficial cardiovascular effects. In humans studies, resveratrol is shown to be less effective. Although, in one positive human trial, extremely high doses (3–5 g) of resveratrol were found to significantly lower blood sugar levels. And with treated worms more energetic, it might be that we can also look forward to sprightly old age. Researcher Professor Johan Auwerx said: ‘You don’t want to live longer and just sit in front of the television.  We want to have active lives.’ The Swiss researchers began by searching for genes involved in the ageing process. By studying mice that live for different lengths of time, they hit upon three genes whose activity was key to lifespan. When the genes only worked at half-power, the animals eight months longer, the journal Nature reports. Professor Auwerx then showed that the genes also regulate longevity in worms. There the results were even more astonishing – tinkering with the worms’ genes increasing lifespan by up to 80 per cent. The genes make a protein that, when pumped out in high quantities, cuts lifespan. With this in mind, Professor Auwerx turned to two widely used antibiotics that block the production of such proteins. In the study from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, scientists tested the effect reservatrol had on the lifespan of worms. It was found to increase the lives of the worms tested by 60%. The worms were also more active, had greater endurance and healthier muscles . Given to worms, they increased lifespan by an average of 60%. Importantly, the worms were also more active, had greater endurance and healthier muscles. This allowed them to continue to wriggle fiercely when untreated worms had become weary. At 13-days-old, the onset of adulthood, they moved twice as much as others. And a week later, when the untreated worms were beginning to show their age, the difference was even more pronounced. A final set of experiments showed that resveratrol, the ‘miracle ingredient’ in red wine uses the same mechanism to extend life. However, the effect wasn’t as dramatic. Professor Auwerx, of the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, said: ‘This research gives us hope not only for increasing longevity, but also for lengthening the period of adult vitality, and doing this with simple drugs as antibiotics.’ While neither long-term antibiotic . use or heavy drinking advisable, the key will be to find a safe drug . that is just as effective. The professor said that it may be that such a pill would only need to be taken during a key period of life, such as puberty. Should it ever hit the market, he believes ‘everyone will be tempted to take it’. Reservatrol could help older people live more energetic lives, like the stars of ITV show Off Their Rockers (pictured). This is based on the findings of a French study that treated worms with reservatrol. Not only did the worms live longer when treated with reservatrol, they were also more energetic. Scientists from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne believe that a similar technique could have the same effect on humans, giving elderly people more energy and zest for life . Other potential ‘fountains of youth’ being researched around the world include a drug that made old mice young again. And a modern, and it is believed, safer, version of thalidomide has shown promise in boosting the odds of a healthy old age. Some experts say the science is moving so quickly that it will soon be possible to prevent many of ills of old age. If lives were healthier as well as longer, people could work for longer – or simply make the most of their retirement. Increasing the number of years of healthy life would also greatly ease health service costs and reduce the burden on families of caring for sick relatives.","French scientists discovered that reservatrol, an ingredient found in red wine, can increase lifespan by 60% .

"You can’t take the city out of the boy and, as far as Carl Frampton is concerned, you can’t take the boy out of the city either. The rising cross-over star of the British ring — from Ulster idolatry to appreciation on mainland UK, from the hardcore boxing audience to multi-million viewership on mainstream terrestrial television — is so grounded in Belfast that he is considering back-tracking on his recent move with his young family to a farmhouse outside his home town. ‘It’s a bit of a handsome place but when we look out of the window across the fields there’s not another house to be seen,’ he says. Carl Frampton poses with Sportsmail's Jeff Powell (left) and Barry McGuigan (right) in a Battersea gym . Frampton will defend his IBF super-bantamweight title against Chris Avalos in Belfast a week on Saturday . Frampton pictured using the sauna as he undergoes the final stages of his preparation to take on Avalos . Frampton says he was easily picked on in the streets because he was 'short, small and had big ears' They call ‘yer man Carl’ The Jackal but this is an urban animal: ‘I’m a Belfast lad to my bones.’ Frampton is talking as he prepares to headline the return of boxing to our major broadcast networks, ITV having picked him as the exciting reason for turning back to the sport for the first time in the best part of a decade. He defends his IBF super-bantamweight title against Chris Avalos, a typically tough Mexican-American, on Saturday week in Belfast’s Odyssey Arena, which has become a steaming cauldron for his exploits. Satellite transmission from Belfast will be beamed live not only across the Irish Sea but also to another 54 countries, the US included. Frampton’s fame will grow worldwide if, as expected, he comes through this mandatory commitment and moves on to world championship unification battles with Bury’s Scott Quigg in Manchester, and then Cuban sensation Guillermo Rigondeaux in America. But no matter how much success he enjoys, it will be the same unspoiled young man who will celebrate by going out for a pint with his pals. Frampton greatly admires Floyd Mayweather as the best pound-for-pound boxer on earth but says: ‘You won’t see me buying a fleet of Bentleys or a private plane. I’ll never change, famous or not. I’ll never be too big for my boots. For one thing, my wife wouldn’t let me. Nor would Belfast, where being flash quickly gets you disliked. I enjoy my friends. A lot of them go back to schooldays. We’re all working-class boys. Not many yuppies there. ‘The tough neighbourhood I come from is a big part of what has made me a world champion. The first punch I threw was probably at my brother, Craig, when we were kids. I had my first sparring session in the gym when I was seven. Frampton's bout with Avalos will be broadcast on ITV and across  54 countries, including the United States . Frampton (left) is put through his paces by Shane McGuigan (right), the son of promoter Barry . Frampton has been training in McGuigan's gym in Battersea as his preparations for the bout intensify . Frampton says that his upbringing in a tough neighbourhood has contributed to his mentality and success . ‘I had to learn how to handle bigger guys. I was easily picked on in the streets because I was short, small and had these big ears.’ That Tiger’s Bay area of Belfast is a hardline Protestant stronghold and Frampton grew up within the bullet-holed walls left behind by the Troubles. He knows that had he not punched his way out he could have gone the wrong way. ‘In a place like that it’s all too easy to do one stupid thing when you’re drunk, make that one mistake which puts you the wrong side of the law.’ Not to mention fall prey to prejudice. In a mirror image of his manager and mentor, legendary ex-world champion Barry McGuigan, Frampton is helping heal that sectarian divide. McGuigan, a Catholic, married a Protestant. Frampton’s bride Christine is Catholic. Fighter and manager have harnessed the two communities, rallying them into a united body of support whenever they climb through the ropes. Such defiance of historic enmities requires the kind of courage demanded of any man entering the professional ring but Frampton defers to McGuigan. He says: ‘Barry was fearless. Had to be, back then. It’s easier for me, Belfast is a better place now. There are more mixed marriages.’ Frampton is crossing boxing’s social divide, too. He says: ‘One of the pleasures for me is that not only are there are folk of all persuasions among my fans but wives and girlfriends insist on the men taking them to the fights. Many of them bring the kids too.’ That was evident when Frampton beat Kiko Martinez to win his world title in a 20,000-seat pop-up arena erected in the dramatic setting of the Titanic shipbuilding yards. But it is within the enclosed, reverberating, 9,000-ticket confines of the Odyssey that his support is at its most deafening. Frampton takes justifiable pride in saying: ‘Honestly, this is the biggest atmosphere for any sporting event in Ireland now — the rugby, hurling and Gaelic football included.’ Frampton (left) stands alongside McGuigan (right) who is his manager and mentor . Frampton is going to defend his IBF super-bantamweight title against Mexican-American Avalos . McGuigan believes that Frampton now has the ability to surpass his won achievements in boxing . Sportsmail's Powell (left) spoke to Frampton (right) about his preparations for the impending fight with Avalos . The frenzy will be cranked up by America’s ‘Let’s get ready to rumble’ ring announcer Michael Buffer, and London’s former world heavyweight champion David Haye is flying to join the party as one of ITV’s commentators. There are loud echoes here of the old King’s Hall in which McGuigan fought his way towards featherweight glory. McGuigan expects his protege to surpass his own achievements, saying: ‘Carl now has the physical strength, the punching power, the speed and the brain to become one of the greatest Irish boxers of all time.’ The full package is cemented by the work ethic which McGuigan impressed upon Frampton as being vital to any plan for conquering the world. ‘The point came when I realised I had to improve my attitude,’ Frampton confesses. ‘I had to get real serious about boxing. Luckily I love the sparring. Not all boxers do but it’s my favourite part of training. The running and some of the other stuff can be boring but I like nothing better than practising what I do.’ More than a hundred rounds of sparring have gone into preparing him to meet Avalos. Most of them against bigger, heavier men. Many, unusually, without the protection of a full headguard, about which he says: ‘I don’t feel comfortable in the crash helmet.’ This core toughness of the natural-born fighter is drawn from his upbringing, so much so that he does not regard the hardest game as especially rigorous. ‘If boxing and me hadn’t found each other I might have been out on the oil rigs, going to war in the army, maybe in a gang. ‘I’m lucky. I’ve never had to think about any other job. If I had, who knows what would have become of me? Frampton is preparing to take on  Avalos (left) at Belfast's Odyssey Arena . Frampton greatly admires Floyd Mayweather but doesn't quite possess his flash lifestyle . The 27-year-old says promoter McGuigan was fearless back in Belfast but it is now easier for him . ‘I’m grateful to boxing. So if me getting on to mainstream television proves to be good for the sport, that’ll be great.’ We are in the gym in south London where a wall has been decorated in boxing idiom by a Portuguese artist who paints murals with his hands. There is enough space for a ring and a minimum of necessary equipment but they are moving to larger premises soon, as the stable presided over by McGuigan and his son Shane, Frampton’s trainer, keeps growing. There is room at the moment for a sauna in which Frampton catches up with his family on a mobile phone while sweating out a head cold so that he can resume sparring. His weight is never an issue since he is rarely, if ever, more than a few pounds over the super-bantamweight  8st 10lb limit. Nor does he take any opponent lightly. ‘Quigg keeps calling me out, and maybe we will do that next, but I expect Avalos to be a harder fight. And although Rigondeaux is the best in the world I want him sooner rather than later.’ The latter of those fights could be built into a blockbuster in Las Vegas, New York or Miami but Frampton does not want that process to take too long. He celebrates his 28th birthday on Saturday and says: ‘Unlike some boxers (such as the 50-year-old Bernard Hopkins) I don’t intend to go on fighting for ever. We want enough to live comfortably but lots of money is not on my agenda. ‘Nor is celebrity. My ambitions are all professional. I would like to become the undisputed world champion, then go up to win titles in at least one more division. I hope that would carry me into the boxing Hall of Fame. ‘Then it would be time to repay my wife for putting my career before her own. Time for me to take over looking after our daughters so she can go back to work.’ Frampton knocks down Martinez during their IBF super-bantamweight world title bout in September . Frampton would like to fight Scott Quigg and Guillermo Rigondeaux, the latter of which possible in the USA . Christine is a lawyer and was embarking on a career in criminal justice before marrying Carl and giving birth to Carla, now four, and nine-month-old Rossa. Before Frampton quits the ring he will put it to his wife that moving the family back into the city might be more convenient for her to resume her profession.

"Embarrassed: Gregg Wrigley, 28, has lost 12 stone through dieting and exercise - but the folds of skin left behind are making him miserable . A determined chef who shed almost half his bodyweight after reaching 27 stone is now begging the NHS for an operation to remove his excess skin. Gregg Wrigley, from Bolton in Greater Manchester, lost 12 stone through dieting and exercise, and says the health service's refusal to help with the final step is making him miserable. 'If I’d had gastric band surgery it . would have cost the NHS several thousands of pounds but I’ve lost the . weight myself and that hasn’t cost them a penny,' said the 28-year-old. He said he had 'always being quite big' and had started piling on the pounds . while a pupil at Canon Slade School. After leaving school, he put on even more weight until he reached a hefty 27 stone. Mr Wrigley, a head chef at an old . people’s home in Bury, said: 'The last thing I wanted to do when I got . home was to cook, so I’d get takeaways. 'People used to refer to me as Big Gregg.' His sister, 28-year-old Rebecca Stone, persuaded him to lose weight when her first daughter, . Stephanie, now aged three, was born. 'She said she wanted Stephanie to have an uncle and she feared I wouldn’t be around much longer if I continued the way I was,' Mr Wrigley totally changed his lifestyle - taking up exercise, cutting down on alcohol, eating healthily and joining WeightWatchers. If he had been given a gastric band, available on the NHS, it could have cost the taxpayer up to £7,000. Three years later, he weighs just over . 15 stone, but is unhappy with the extra skin that is left on his . stomach, arms and thighs, which he estimates weighs one-and-a-half . stone. 'The skin is hideous and makes me feel dreadful,' he said. 'I have no confidence and feel really upset when I look at myself.' Desperate: Mr Wrigley (left, holding bottle) cannot afford to have the operation on his skin privately . Mr Wrigley believes he was refused . because the surgery is classed as cosmetic and therefore not a priority. 'It seems so unfair when it is making me so miserable,' he added. The operation is not available on the NHS where he lives, and he cannot afford private care. 'Swimming is the very best exercise, yet there is no way I can go swimming when I look like this,' he said. He is awaiting vital surgery on a damaged knee, but cannot have that operation until his weight is under 15 stone. An NHS Bolton spokesman said: 'We have a . policy over what surgeries can be routinely funded by the NHS and this . type of surgery is not.' He added that Mr Wrigley had a right to appeal.","Gregg Wrigley has lost 12 stone through diet and exercise .

"Whatever the upshot from that New York lawyer’s bizarre appeal against his own report into allegations of World Cup bidding corruption – and don’t hold your breath on that one – England’s claim to the moral high ground has been blown from under their feet. Whether or not FIFA’s ethics committee have finessed – twisted even – Michael Garcia’s findings with regard to Qatar 2022, the Football Association are in the dock for the way they went about campaigning to host the 2018 finals instead of Russia. Of all people, the custodians of our national game crawled into bed with the disgraced Jack Warner who FIFA, none other, have kicked out of their vice-presidency and who has been cited for fraud by the governing body of football in the Americas, of which he used to be president. Warner told Prince William and David Cameron and David Beckham he would vote for England - then reneged . England bid team could be punished over 2018 World Cup efforts... but Qatar are cleared to host 2022 event! FIFA investigator Garcia to appeal against his own body's interpretation of his report . Russia 2018 bid's computers and emails 'destroyed', say FIFA . Who is Michael Garcia? Sportsmail's lowdown on FIFA investigator . They granted lavish favours and squandered millions on this treacherous figure who did not even vote for England when it came to casting his ballot. In so doing the FA dragged their own president, Prince William, two of this country’s Prime Ministers, Gordon Brown and David Cameron, our ultimate Olympian Lord Coe and even poor old unsuspecting David Beckham, among many, into the mire with them. It used to seem that the FA were merely naïve and incompetent when it came to international football affairs. Now, with this shabby business following their reneging on the gentleman’s agreement not to bid against Germany for the 2006 World Cup, they appear at best stupid, at worst as dodgy as those they have presumed to impugn. While it may seem disproportionate for England’s dubious dealings to catch most of the back-draft from an investigation into something as serious as how over-heated Qatar came to be awarded a World Cup, there can be no escaping the FA’s sorry reality now. The FA are set to come under fire for trying to woo former FIFA vice president Warner (second left) After the humiliation of receiving only two votes for 2018 this, the mother country of the global game, is now a broken off-shoot from the world football community, bereft of even the slightest influence. After all the English ranting at FIFA, long is it likely to remain so. As for the tin pot MPs who have done nothing about bent bankers, failed to indict Tony Blair for going to war under false pretences or call their own House to order for fraudulent misconduct - but have been falling over themselves to jump on the populist anti-FIFA bandwagon - they are left clinging to an American lawyer’s coat-tails. Good luck with that, since Garcia will be perceived in many quarters abroad as trying to distance himself from the backlash on social media following Qatar’s absolution from wrong-doing, in case it damages his ambition of high office in Washington. And as for the backlash itself – whipped up as it is here by jingoistic resentment of England not being given the 2018 World Cup – the most popular remedies being suggested are impractical. Resign from FIFA, they cry. Boycott the World Cup. Former FIFA vice-president Warner has been kicked out of the organisation . Quite simply, the FA cannot afford to do that. Already grappling with the financial implications of the new Wembley and the centre of coaching excellence, they need not only big England international matches to avoid the risk of going broke but – like it or not – their share in the financial windfall from World Cups. And even if they did pull out, they would find themselves isolated. There is a notion that the US, if no-one else, would walk with us. That founders on their understanding that FIFA will take the World Cup back to North America soon, perhaps in 2026, the successor to Qatar. There are few echoes abroad of the uproar in this country. FIFA president Sepp Blatter is a racing certainty for re-election in May because the overwhelming majority of national federations appreciate the billions he generates for the sustenance and development of football around the planet. As for Garcia’s protest, the FIFA appeals committee is manned mostly by representatives of the countries in most urgent need of that income. Our hitherto invisible MP have started demanding examination of the World Cup bidding process by governments and their police forces. They seem unaware that the most relevant national state, given that FIFA is based in Zurich, recently completed an exhaustive criminal investigation. Their principal target was Blatter, whom they ultimately cleared of all suspicion. Nor did they find anything to indict in FIFA’s governance of football. The Sir Alf Ramsey statue in Ipswich . Not only that but the ghastly Warner is only one of half-a-dozen or so officials who have been rooted out by FIFA with far greater alacrity than our government have ousted the crooks in the City and in Parliament. Wherever the Qatar fandango leads it won’t be England sign-posting the direction – or hosting a World Cup in most of our lifetimes. Cheers to Sir Alf Ramsey - help save this local pub . The locals are revolting. Patrons of The Sir Alf Ramsey in Tunbridge Wells are fighting to prevent the demolition of the only pub named after England’s World Cup-winning manager. They are asking football lovers around the country to help them lobby politicians in Kent and the editor of the local Courier newspaper, as well as taking to social media. Pressure is mounting against planning application by the owner for the building to be sold, knocked down and replaced by four homes. There are two notable monuments to Sir Alf, a statue in Ipswich which became his home town during his successful time there as manager and a bust of his head in the players’ tunnel at the new Wembley Stadium. Both are impressive. But the pub stands alone in preserving a priceless World Cup memory, that of how he used to buy his players ‘just one beer’ at the England team hotel on the evenings before their big matches.

"No, the richest fight of all time has not been set in paper, let alone stone. Not yet. Yes, the lines on the contract still wait to be dotted, let alone signed upon by Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. But yes, also, the big businesses needed to help generate the prize-ring’s first £200million bonanza are swinging into action already. The travel industry, especially. Manny Pacquiao (left) and Floyd Mayweather chat at an NBA match last month . Air and accommodation packages have now gone on sale here in Britain for the second half of the week ending Saturday, May 2 in Las Vegas. Cost – anything up to £4,000-a-head for deals based on flights in economy. The MGM Grand – the giant resort and casino on that neon Strip in the desert – has been keeping its Grand Garden Arena on hold for some time now. More significantly it has just raised its basic room rates for the nights of May 1 and 2 – by more than treble to in excess of $500 (£325) for the first time. Other hotels in Vegas are also hiking their prices. All the above are selling like hot cakes. Everyone is gambling that the deal of the century will be done. Packages to watch the potential £200million bout are already on sale with some companies . It is believed that ringside seats will cost $5,000 (£3,250) each, with the pay-per-view subscriptions in the US being priced at $100 (£65) each... if it happens. The only thing which might bring it all crashing down in is a premature announcement that the fight is truly on. One of Mayweather’s stipulations is that he makes the announcement. Pacquiao has publicly conceded that privilege. But wishful media speculation that he has signed a contract, supposedly based on information from unattributed sources close to the Filipino camp, threaten to crush the hopes of the boxing world, the PacMan himself included. Mayweather does not like that. He dismissed the story out of hand when he attended the NBA All-Star game in New York at the weekend, when many expected him to declare the fight on: ‘It’s not true. I’ve not signed yet. He’s not signed yet. It’s all speculation and rumour.’ The Money Man’s Showtime TV paymaster Stephen Espinosa confirmed: ‘There is no contract yet. Sorry to tell the truth.’ Mayweather attends the NBA All-Star match at Madison Square Garden in New York on Sunday . Still, there were sighs of relief all round when Mayweather added: ‘Hopefully we can make it happen.’ Maybe the thought of the fortune to be made softened his stance a little. The most recent estimates suggest that Mayweather stands to bank a minimum of $150m (£97m), Pacquiao at least $100m (£65m). There are suggestions that only two sticking points remain to be unglued, one between Showtime and the HBO television network who deal with Pacquiao, the other involving two rival beer breweries who each sponsor one of the boxers. WBC President Jose Sulaiman is blaming the delay on 'abuse of power'. Although he is not sure by whom. Sulaiman, on a flying visit to London said: 'It could be one or both the fighters, promoters, the managers, or the TV stations but I want to make it clear its not us.' Pacquiao lands a left hook on Chris Algieri on his way to victory in Macau back in November . Mayweather is this organisation's world welterweight champion and Sulaiman adds: 'We are doing everything possible to remove any obstacle from this happening. It's not fair to the fans if they don't make this fight, which everyone wants to see. It will be terrible it it doesn't happen this year because it would be bring so much greater exposure to boxing and transform the sport.' Even so, he raised the prospects of it happening this year rather than next as 'no better than 50-50.' Meanwhile, the long wait goes on. But even as it does so boxing lovers the world over, in their anxiety about missing out, are gambling on advance bookings. In terms of his credibility and his legacy, it may not be wise for Mayweather to disappoint them. George Groves has been promised that if he remains patient he is guaranteed his world super middleweight title shot later this year. Saint George was disappointed when the WBC suddenly granted Anthony Dirrell the right to a voluntary defence of their belt prior to meeting his mandatory challenge of Groves. Dirrell is being allowed to fight an opponent of his choice in April but WBC President Jose Sulaiman assures Groves: 'Dirrell will then have to fight George by the autumn.' George Groves has been told he will have a world super middleweight title fight this year . Martin Murray truly believes he can become the first boxer to defeat the most dangerous fighter on the planet. Gennady Golovkin, the heaviest pound-for-pound puncher in the world, says he will defend his middleweight crown by knock-out when they meet in the ring in Monte Carlo this Saturday night. Murray, who came up only narrowly short in his two previous world title challenges to Felix Sturm in Germany and Sergio Martinez in Argentina, says: ‘I’m not afraid of him.’ In that, at the very least, we can believe him. Martin Murray takes on hard-hitting Gennady Golovkin in Monte Carlo on Saturday night . Golovkin has promised to knock out the Brit and retain his WBO and IBA belts . But it would be a monumental achievement for the impressively reformed convict from St Helens to overcome the unbeaten Kazakh. Golovkin knocks out opponents for fun, as Anglo-Irish warrior Matthew Macklin is one of many to have discovered already. Andy Lee, Ireland’s holder of another version of the middleweight championship, will be among those in attendance/ He is keeping a watching brief in case he overcomes the challenges of, first, Peter Quillin in America, then Hertford’s Billy Joe Saunders and goes on to face Golovkin in a unification battle. *Golovkin-Murray will be televised live on Channel 5 on Saturday night.","Floyd Mayweather in talks to fight Manny Pacquiao .

"The cancer drug bexarotene, marketed as Targretin, was said to reverse the build-up of the brain plaques which have been linked Alzheimer's . A 'wonder' drug hailed as a new treatment for Alzheimer's may be ineffective, experts have warned. The cancer drug bexarotene, marketed as Targretin, was said to reverse the build-up of the brain plaques which have been linked Alzheimer's. A high profile 2012 report, published in journal Science, reported that the drug quickly removed most of the plaques in the brains of mice and rapidly reversed the pathological, cognitive and memory deficits related to the onset of Alzheimer's. The results were 'stunning' to the scientific community but seemed 'too good to be true', it was claimed at the time. Now, another team of experts writing in the same journal say they have been unable to replicate the results of the original study and have called the findings into doubt. Researchers at the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, Massachusetts General Hospital, Washington University in St Louis and University of Tubingen in Germany, jointly stated: ‘The drug has no impact on plaque burden. ‘We have failed to support earlier findings that Targretin is efficacious in reducing plaque burden in transgenic mouse models of cerebral plaque deposition.’ Professor Sangram Sisodia, of the University of Chicago, said he and his colleagues were curious about the initial report in 2012. He said: ‘We were surprised and excited, even stunned, when we first saw these results presented at a small conference. ‘The mechanism of action made some sense, but the assertion that they could reduce the areas of plaque by 50 per cent within three days, and by 75 per cent in two weeks, seemed too good to be true. ‘We all went back to our labs and tried to confirm these promising findings. ‘We repeated the initial experiments - a standard process in science. Combined results are really important in this field. None of us found anything like what they described in the 2012 paper.’ The researchers found no effects on plaque burden of mice that were treated with bexarotene. They say that the discrepancy is not only disappointing but also raises concerns for patient safety. The drug was approved for treating a . type of skin cancer, meaning it is also available by prescription for . 'off label' uses as well. But is has never been tested as a . treatment for Alzheimer's in humans and has side effects including . headaches, vomiting and liver problems. New research suggests that the drug, which has severe side effects, has no effect upon the plaques which cause Alzheimer's symptoms. Image shows CT scans of the brain of an Alzheimer's patient . Despite the lack of testing on Alzheimer’s patients, it is believed that many requested that their doctors prescribed them the medication and, in some cases, were given it. Professor Robert Vassar, of Northwestern University, said: ‘Anecdotally, we have all heard that physicians are treating their Alzheimer's patients with bexarotene, a cancer drug with severe side effects. ‘This practice should be ended immediately, given the failure of three independent research groups to replicate the plaque-lowering effects of bexarotene.’ But other experts, also writing in Science, said that the cognitive effects on the mice had been replicated, even if the effects on plaque had not. University of Pittsburgh professor, Rada Koldamova said that the drug did improve cognitive effects on mice, although tests could not confirm the actual effects on the plaques. Professor Koldamova said: ‘We believe these findings make a solid case for continued exploration of bexarotene as a therapeutic treatment for Alzheimer's disease.’ Co-author Iliya Lefterov said: ‘We were already set up to repeat the Case Western Reserve University study to see if we could independently arrive at the same findings. ‘While we were able to verify that the mice quickly regained their lost cognitive skills and confirmed the decrease in amyloid beta peptides in the interstitial fluid that surrounds brain cells, we did not find any evidence that the drug cleared the plaques from their brains.’","Research had implied cancer drug Targretin improved Alzheimer's symptoms .

"Just days after she was accused of faking a Nevada residency, the newly-crowned Miss America failed to name the state's capital during a radio show quiz. Miss Nevada Nia Sanchez, who was crowned Miss USA on June 9, was accused of falsely claiming Nevada residency so that she could enter the state's pageant while continuing to live and work in California. On June 16, Sanchez was participating in a quiz on The Todd Show when she was asked to name the capital of Nevada. All smiles: Nia Sanchez before she was questioned about Nevada's capital on The Todd Show . Tip of her tongue: Sanchez searched desperately for an answer but one of the hosts eventually jumped in and told her the capital of Nevada is Carson City . 'Oh, um, ah, oh my gosh,' she hedged, clicking her fingers while she struggled to answer the question. The host took pity on the beauty queen and told her the answer: Carson City. 'Thank . you, I was going to say that! I was like, that one DJ host on MTV, back . in the day, his name, that's how I always remembered it,' Sanchez said, . but was also unable to name the host she was thinking of. Someone supplied the answer, and she said, 'Carson Daly, that guy!' Cheater? Newly-crowned Miss USA Nia Sanchez answered questions about her Nevada residency in an interview with Fox News . Sanchez won the coveted title competing as Miss Nevada, but some have claimed that she did not really live in Nevada, so shouldn't have been allowed into that state's pageant. She has stated categorically that Nevada is her home and that she did not cheat her way to victory. 'Nothing . could have been more thrilling for me than to have won the Miss USA . title. I have lived in Nevada since the fall of 2012 and it was an honor . for me to represent the state at Miss USA,' she said in a statement. After three consecutive failed . attempts to win the Miss California USA crown, in 2010, 2011 and 2012, . Sanchez, 24, won the Miss Nevada competition in January. However, unnamed sources have suggested that Sanchez only met the Nevada pageant's . minimum residency requirements to compete for the crown, but she didn't . actually live in the Silver State. 'She never actually moved to Nevada, but continued to work at Disney and live in California, setting up some minimum paper trail to appear like she was in Nevada and allow her to compete,' a 'well-placed' source told Fox News. 'Shanna Moakler is the Nevada director, and she personally coached Nia on what she needed to do to qualify in Nevada and skirt around the need to be actually from there.' California girl: Miss Nevada Nia Sanchez won the competition last Sunday night, but sources say she lives in Los Angeles . Not true: Sanchez says there's 'no truth' to the claims and that she has been living in Las Vegas, working as a model, for the past 18 months which is more than the six-month residency rule . Moakler won the Miss USA competition . in 1995 and went on to become the director of the Nevada pageant in 2011. However, Sanchez says there's 'no truth' to the claim she received . special treatment. She says . she competed in the pageant by the books, living in Nevada for more than . 18 months before signing up which is longer than the required six-month . residency rule. '[Las Vegas] is my home,' Sanchez said. 'I have a house there with a friend.' The Miss Universe Organization told ABC News there is 'no reason to question her residency.' Could they have won? Audra Mari, Miss North Dakota (left) came second in the contest and Miss Georgia Tiana Griggs (right) came a respectable third in line to the crown . Small pond: Sources say many Californian girls set up residency in Nevada because there's fewer women to compete against in the neighboring state . Nervous embrace: Miss North Dakota USA Audra Mari, left, and Miss Nevada USA Nia Sanchez await the final decision . 'I actually had an agent that was working with me in Nevada a lot so I figured why not work in that state, and then I looked into the pageant program because I had done pageants before,' she explained. 'So I figured why not look into the one in Nevada? I really liked the way that it was run, the director that ran it, it seemed like a really healthy, well-run state program. So I decided to go there since I was living there anyway.' According to her Miss USA application, Sanchez currently works for AC Model Agency which has branches in both Las Vegas and Los Angeles but her profile with the company lists her as living in California. She defenends the profile, saying that's where all the lucrative modeling jobs are at but that most of her work is done in Las Vegas. Before that, she worked at Disneyland as a princess and competed in the Miss California competition in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Another source said California pagaent queens often cross the state line to compete in Nevada becamase 'it was easier there'. Strutting her stuff: Miss Nevada Nia Sanchez takes the runway during the evening gown portion of the pageant . Here I am! Miss Nevada Nia Sanchez takes the runway during the swimsuit portion . In California, pagaent girls went up against 100-200 other women whereas there were only 33 in the pool for Nevada's competition. Sanchez says it's just not true that the competition is eaiser in Nevada. 'At least this year in Nevada, we had such strong compeititon. All the girls were not only beautiful, they were smart, college-educated well-rounded women…. I think it was a really tough competition.' However there are other pagaent insiders who think it's wrong to move to compete in a different state, even if the girls do it according to competition rules. 'Most women are really proud to represent their home state, and it starts to become unfair to the hometown contestants competing when this happens,' said Angie Meyer, a former PR representative for the Miss California pageant. 'If you can’t win at home, you have no business competing elsewhere.'

"A country life may sound idyllic, but experts have found a possible link between rural living and Parkinson's disease. Analysis of more than 100 studies from around the world shows that exposure to pesticides, bug and weed killers and solvents is associated with a higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease. Study author, Dr Emanuele Cereda, said: . 'Due to this association, there was also a link between farming or . country living and developing Parkinson's in some of the studies.' Exposure to chemicals associated with country has been linked to an increased risk of Parkinson's disease . Researchers from the IRCCS University Hospital San Matteo Foundation in Pavia, Italy, reviewed studies that looked at weed, fungus, rodent or bug killers, and solvents in relation to the risk of developing Parkinson's disease. Proximity to these chemicals, due to country living, occupation and drinking water were also evaluated. The research found that being exposed to bug or weed killers and solvents increased the risk of developing Parkinson's disease by 33 to 80 per cent. In controlled studies, exposure to the weed killer paraquat or the fungicides maneb and mancozeb was associated with twice the risk of developing the disease. Parkinson's is a chronic neurological disorder due a to deficiency in dopamine . Dr Cereda added: 'We didn't study whether the type of exposure, such as whether the compound was inhaled or absorbed through the skin and the method of application, such as spraying or mixing, affected Parkinson's risk. 'However, our study suggests that the risk increases in a dose response manner as the length of exposure to these chemicals increases.' Parkinson's Disease is a chronic neurological disorder, characterised by a deficiency of  dopamine. This affects the way the brain co-ordinates the movements of the muscles in different parts of the body. The disease mainly develops in the over 50s. About 5 in 1,000 people in their 60s, and about 40 in 1,000 people in their 80s have the condition. The main symptoms are slowness of movement, stiffness of muscles and shaking. These tend to slowly worsen with time although the rate varies from patient to patient. There is currently no cure. The research appears in the journal Neurology.","Italian researchers looked at studies involving exposure to weed, fungus, rodent or bug .

"This is the platinum watch given by Adolf Hitler to his mistress Eva Braun for her 27th birthday. The Eszeha watch was engraved with 'Zum 6.2.1939 herzlichst A. Hitler' (‘On 6 February 1939, most affectionately, A. Hitler’) with a registration code of 86439 and had been hidden in a Munich museum. It was found at the Pinakothek der Moderne (Gallery of the Modern) by researchers with Der Spiegel (The Mirror) magazine, stored together with other valuable Nazi objects hidden from the public. From the past: The Eszeha watch (left) belonging to Eva Braun (right) had been hidden at a Munich museum . Miss Braun met the Nazi leader through Heinrich Hoffman, whom she worked for as an assistant. He became Hitler’s personal photographer and the couple had a secret romance in the 1930s. Hitler’s mistress joined him in Berlin towards the end of the war and they married on April 29 1945, before committing suicide together the next day - to avoid being captured by enemy troops. Miss Braun was born in 1912 in Munich and she attended a convent school. The relationship with Hitler was kept secret until after the Second World War had finished in 1945. It comes as Angela Merkel had to choose what to do with her office rug after it was found to be part of a collection of treasures looted by wartime air force chief and deputy Fuehrer Hermann Goering.

The rug in the German Chancellor’s office was discovered by Der Spiegel journalists writing about Nazi booty that is still scattered about government guest houses, offices and in museums. Mrs Merkel was said to be furious at the embarrassing revelation, coming as it does months before her third bid for power in the general election and with the opposition snapping at her heels. The rug was said to be one of more than 600 objects that the government still uses from the vast mountain of looted artworks that Goering and others amassed for themselves during the war. Also found in the Pinakothek der Moderne museum were many possessions of Goering, such as platinum and gold cufflinks, a ring with diamonds as well as a golden cup for champagne.","Adolf Hitler gave watch to Eva Braun for 27th birthday on February 6, 1939 .

Ms Hays admits she looks pale and that she has trouble walking, but her only health condition is a neurological disorder known as white mass disease - and it's not transmissible. She says she wasn't sick then and isn't sick now. But her protests fell on deaf ears aboard the plane, she told KTLV. 'They acted like I had leprosy. It was awful I have never been treated like that in my life,' she said. Ms Hays says the experience was humiliating.

"When Deborah Lee James became top boss of the Air Force seven months ago she had no inkling a nuclear crisis was brewing. But once it erupted in the form of exam-cheating by dozens of missile launch officers, she quickly announced conclusions that no Air Force leader before her had dared state publicly. The nuclear missile corps' problems run deep, she said, morale is 'spotty' and forceful fixes are needed. James reached those conclusions in January after a short visit to the three Air Force bases that operate intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James speaks to the Associated Press during an interview at the Pentagon on July 11 . She met not only with commanders but with the rank-and-file, including enlisted airmen who keep the missiles running properly and junior officers trained to launch them. 'I walked away believing there was something systemic, cultural if you will, that went beyond cheating and (that's) why I felt like we needed to not just address cheating — yes, we have to fix that — but we need to go farther than that,' she said in an Associated Press interview in her Pentagon office overlooking the Potomac River. To her it seemed natural to acknowledge this publicly, although others in the Air Force had chosen not to. 'I hope and believe I am a straight talker,' she said. 'I think it's better to just say it. Don't mince words. And so I thought it was important to just stand up publicly and say what seemed to be obvious to me.' Her candor and crisis management have won praise from Republicans and Democrats alike. 'She has forged relationships with troops and listened to their inputs,' said Rep. Howard 'Buck' McKeon, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. 'She has identified shortfalls in ICBM leadership and made corrections. That is a sharp difference from the way Air Force leadership has handled these issues in the past.' James, 55, is only the second woman to serve as Air Force secretary, the service's top civilian official. She took office in December 2013 following months of Associated Press reports documenting problems inside the nuclear missile corps, starting with the sidelining in April 2013 of 19 launch officers at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota for what commanders called attitude and performance flaws. It was an unprecedented action and coincided with the AP's publication of an internal email from an officer at Minot complaining of 'rot' inside the ICBM force. Deborah Lee Jameshas been praised for the way she handled the Air Force exam scandal . Senior Air Force officers at the time generally dismissed the reports, saying any problems were localized and limited. 'I don't particularly agree that we have any compelling problems' in the ICBM force, Maj. Gen. Garrett Harencak, the top nuclear weapons staff officer at Air Force headquarters, said in June 2013. 'The morale of our crews out there — I've been out there — is exceedingly, exceedingly, good.' James took a look for herself in January 2014 and saw something different, worse than she had imagined. She traveled to each of the three ICBM bases after disclosing at a Pentagon news conference that 34 launch officers at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana had been implicated in a cheating scandal and a small number of those were also suspects in an illegal drug use investigation. (The number implicated in the cheating later rose to nearly 100.) Before James hit the road she quickly gathered enough information about the dimensions of the cheating to satisfy herself that it did not amount to 'a major problem that could be of catastrophic consequences'. 'But still, why did this happen and what is going on?' she asked herself. What she found was a set of interconnected problems that went deeper than the cheating. She spotted morale issues, with airmen asking, in essence, why is it that the Air Force claims the nuclear mission is its No. 1 priority and yet missile facilities are in poor shape and spare parts are in short supply? 'Some of the things I saw had been of a longstanding nature,' she said. 'So why had these things not gotten fixed before? It's a good question, and I can't really answer that.' James, a native of Rumson, New Jersey, never served in the military but spent a decade — from 1983 to 1993 — as a professional staff member on the House Armed Services Committee, which has oversight responsibility for the Defense Department. From 2002-13 she was a senior executive at Science Applications International Corp. in McLean, Virginia. John Hamre, who was on the professional staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee while she was a counterpart on the House side, said he was not surprised that she quickly sized up the nuclear problem and attacked it head on. 'She is wise enough to know that you cannot fudge your way through a political problem if you don't solve it. It keeps coming back. The way she handled the ICBM problem was typical Debbie James,' said Hamre, who also worked closely with James from 1993-97 when he was the Pentagon's budget chief and she was assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs. Hamre, who later was deputy defense secretary, is now president and chief executive officer of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. James said she was surprised by the ICBM crisis, but not unprepared. 'Life comes at you fast and furious sometimes,' she said with a grin.","Nine Air Force officers were fired in March following a widespread exam cheating scandal .

"Following ‘bendgate’ and recent complaints about Apple’s iOS software, the firm is facing yet another issue with its iPhone 6 Plus. Users have reported a fault with the 5.5-inch model’s camera that means photos won’t focus, even when the phone is held perfectly still. The same users have managed to get replacement devices, or have the camera fixed, but the cause of the fault is still unknown. Scroll down for video . iPhone 6 Plus users have reported a fault with the 5.5-inch model’s camera that stops photos from focusing, even when the phone is held perfectly still. It is not known how many people are affected by the flaw, and whether it is a hardware or software issue. Apple has not replied to MailOnline’s request for comment . It is also not known how many people are affected by the flaw, and whether it is a hardware or software issue. Apple has not replied to MailOnline’s request for comment. Optical Image Stablisation (OIS) was introduced on the iPhone 6 Plus. It works with the phone’s A8 chip, gyroscope and M8 motion coprocessor to measure motion data and provide precise lens movement. It was designed specifically to compensate for shaking hands when the camera is taking pictures in lower light. It also fuses long- and short-exposure images together to helps reduce subject motion. Apple claims this ‘unique integration of hardware and software delivers beautiful low-light photos.’ The fault was reported on the Apple support forums by user oneZer01, who wrote: ‘iPhone 6 Plus rear camera is not focusing, won't remain stable and is blurry, no matter how still I [am]. ‘Automatic or manual focus not working either, [but the] front facing camera works fine.’ The user blamed the fault on Apple’s Optical Image Stablisation (OIS) feature, introduced to the iPhone 6 Plus released in September.

"Drinking a can of fizzy drink a day could increase the risk of kidney stones by almost a quarter . Drinking a can of fizzy drink a day could increase the risk of kidney stones by almost a quarter, new research shows. The study found that drinking sugar-sweetened drinks makes the painful stones more likely to develop. Other drinks - such as coffee, tea and orange juice - reduced the risk, the research by Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston, U.S., found. Dr Gary Curhan said in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology: ‘Our study found that the relation between fluid intake and kidney stones may be dependent on the type of beverage consumed. ‘We found that higher consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks was associated with a higher incidence of kidney stones.’ About three in 20 British men and one in 20 women develop a kidney stone at some stage in their life, and they are often advised to drink more fluids to prevent them reforming. But Dr Curhan said the new study shows some drinks may be more beneficial than others. His team studied data from 194,095 patients over an eight year period. They found that those who consumed one or more sugar-sweetened cola servings per day had a 23 per cent higher chance of developing kidney stones compared with those participants consuming less than one serving per week. This was true for consuming sugar-sweetened non-cola drinks as well, such as punch. Three in 20 British men and one in 20 women develop a kidney stone, and they are often advised to drink more fluids to prevent them reforming . They also found that some beverages, such as coffee, tea and orange juice, were associated with a lower risk of stone formation. Co-author, Dr Pietro Manuel Ferraro, of the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome, said: ‘Our prospective study confirms that some beverages are associated with a lower risk of kidney stone formation, whereas others are associated with a higher risk. ‘Although higher total fluid intake reduces the risk of stone formation, this information about individual beverages may be useful for general practitioners seeking to implement strategies to reduce stone formation in their patients.’","Drinking sugar-sweetened drinks makes the development of kidney stones more likely .

"The Government has again attacked the BBC for sexist sports coverage after presenter Colin Murray said Olympic gold medallist Jessica Ennis-Hill had the ultimate bottom. A capacity crowd at the Olympic Stadium were left shocked by Murray's comments just weeks after John Inverdale said Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli 'was never going to be a looker'. After Inverdale's gaffe Culture Secretary Maria Miller delivered an extraordinary attack on the BBC in a letter to Director General Tony Hall, and now looks set to write to him again. Controversial: Rather than mentioning her athleticism Colin Murray complimented male stars on their speed and stamina, but concentrated on Jessica Ennis-Hill's bottom . Colin Murray had been given the job of geeing up the crowd at the Anniversary Games in the Olympic Stadium. Demand for action: Maria Miller wants further action taken by the BBC to tackle sexism after John Inverdale and Colin Murray's comments . The 36-year-old told the 80,000 people there that the ultimate athlete would have: 'The stamina of Mo (Farah), the speed of (Usain) Bolt, the leap of (Greg) Rutherford and the bottom of Jess Ennis'. Although his comments were not broadcast it led to a row on Twitter where the Northern Irish presenter was accused of sexism and living in the 1950s. Ian Jackson wrote: 'Sexism in sport alive & well. Apparently Jess Ennis just has good bum. Shame on Colin Murray.' Julie Haigh tweeted: 'Boys get their skills mentioned, but @J_Ennis has her bum mentioned. In the 50s are we?' Natalie Vincent added: '@ColinMurray You serious? Colin, did the Inverdale debacle not teach you ANYTHING?' He then tweeted to say: 'Hey guys, I said she was the ""greatest all-round athlete in the . world""'. But Maria Miller is said to be hopping-mad about the incident. 'Tony Hall claimed the Inverdale incident was a one-off and had been dealt with but we have seen other occurrences including this one at the Anniversary Games, which clearly underlines the need for positive action on this issue,' a source close to Ms Miller told the Independent. A spokesman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport added: ""Maria Miller has been clear she wants to see more media coverage of top women's sport, more women on sports boards and more women participating at the grassroots. Recent sexist comments from high-profile commentators focusing on sportswomen's appearances rather than their sporting prowess are unacceptable and show that there is still much work to be done.' Controversial: French tennis player Marion Bartoli (left) and Jessica Ennis-Hill have both been subject to comments from broadcasters who have failed to concentrate on their achievements . Colin Murray has been described as a 'Marmite' broadcaster - as people either love him or hate him.

"Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has been cleared of any wrongdoing after comparing the shape of a new Japanese car to the Elephant Man. Controversial Clarkson said the  Japanese car and camper van hybrid looked like 'people with growths on their faces'. He then mimicked the famous disfigured Victorian man Joseph Merrick - played by actor John Hurt in the 1980 film - as he spoke about the car. Cleared: Jeremy Clarkson likened a Japanese car to the Elephant Man (the label given to Joseph Merrick, right) Clarkson said the  Japanese car and camper van hybrid looked like 'people with growths on their faces' during a Top Gear episode in February. The brand of the car was not mentioned on the show but is believed to be a Prius . The star slurred his speech saying that the car resembled something you would not talk to at a party. Richard Hammond then dubbed it the 'elephant car'. His behaviour on the BBC motoring show Top Gear in February sparked outrage with the boss of a disfigurement charity saying such comments led to ridicule and bullying. Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom received 41 complaints from outraged viewers and the BBC more than 55. But despite this, Ofcom announced its decision today not to proceed with the complaints. A spokesman said that, after careful assessment, Ofcom had decided not to pursue them because they did not raise issues warranting investigation. He said: 'Ofcom recognises that the comments were potentially offensive to individuals living with facial disfigurement. 'However, on balance, we believe that they would not have exceeded the likely expectation of the audience, and any potential offence was justified by the context.' But he added: 'We have informed the BBC of the issues raised by the complainants so they can be taken into consideration for future programmes.' Controversial: Jeremy Clarkson jokes that striking public sector workers should be shot as he appears on BBC 1's The One Show . Reaction: Presenters Matt Baker and Alex Jones react to the remarks which sparked around 31,700 complaints . During the BBC2 show on February 5, a Japanese car-camper van hybrid was discussed. The brand was not mentioned although it is believed to be a Prius. Clarkson compared it to 'people with growths on their faces' in the programme - repeated the following Thursday. James Partridge, chief executive of the charity Changing Faces, said that Clarkson's remarks 'create a culture of ridicule and bullying' against people who are ill, disabled or have unusual features. The uproar came after Clarkson said that striking public sector workers 'should be shot in front of their families'. Clarkson was forced to apologise and the regulator launched an investigation after his remark, made on The One Show, sparked around 31,700 complaints. But he was cleared by the regulator. In February 2009, Clarkson famously called then-prime minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'. In November the previous year, the BBC received almost 2,000 complaints when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes. And just last month, Clarkson sparked controversy by suggesting that long queues at airport control could be solved by 'a bit of racism'. The presenter said that delays were caused because immigration officials could no longer use their discretion to wave certain passengers through.","BBC's Top Gear presenter slurred his speech like Joseph Merrick in 1980 film .

"A grandfather and veteran councillor has been reprimanded by council bosses for making what was claimed to be a ‘sexist’ remark about a colleague’s figure. Mel Winter, 71, was carrying a cup of coffee in each hand when Labour councillor Hailey Townsend, 29, asked if he wanted her to open the door for him at their council HQ. Mr Winter replied: ‘With a figure like that, you can hold the door all day.’ Long-standing councillor Mel Winter has been . given a slap on the wrist for comments he made about fellow member .

Mr Winter, who has been an independent councillor in Bridgend, South Wales, for 30 years, said: ‘It is a sad day when you can’t make a compliment to a lady. ‘I think of myself as a gentleman and I get on with most women, young and old. ‘I was passing her a compliment in good faith and in a light-hearted manner.

"Shelia Simmons, 59, is warning people not to have cosmetic surgery after a botched facelift nearly killed her . A woman who was left fighting for her life after a botched facelift has warned other people not to go under the knife. Sheila Simmons, 59, whose partner is 17 years her junior, decided to have the operation to look younger. But now, after her seventh reconstructive operation to repair the damage caused, she wants to warn other women not to go under the knife. She said: ‘What happened to me was truly terrifying. I have regretted having the facelift every day since the operation. ‘I could have died and not only did it ruin my looks, it left me living a constant nightmare of more surgery to correct the damage. ‘I wish I had never ever gone ahead and want to warn others that it is not worth the risk.’ The grandmother from Manchester first started thinking about surgery as she approached her fifties. She said: ‘I’d read a lot about it and it seemed an easy way of rolling back the years and ironing out the worry lines. ‘My partner Steve didn’t want me to have it done but I was conscious that he was younger than me and I wanted to look good.’ Ms Simmons had her first consultation with a plastic surgeon in April 2007 and just one month later was admitted to a local clinic for a full facelift, eye lift and chemical wrinkle peel. The procedure cost her £10,000 and she was in surgery for five hours. ‘It seemed very professional and I had total confidence in them,’ she said. ‘I expected it to hurt when I came round but when I opened my eyes it felt like my skin was so tight it was going to split. I was struggling to breathe and gasping for air. I knew instantly something was seriously wrong.’ The grandmother (pictured left before the surgery) decided to have a facelift so that she looked younger for her partner Steve Buckley (right) who is 17 years her junior . She was prescribed antibiotics and told not to worry despite her face continuing to swell. ‘I was assured it was normal but my head was twice its usual size. I was terrified,’ she said. Ms Simmons was discharged from hospital three days later but started to suffer from crippling stomach cramps and severe diarrhoea. She said: ‘I couldn’t sleep, I looked and felt horrific and my partner and I were utterly distraught.’ Mr Buckley, 42, turned to the internet and discovered the type of staples used for her facelift contained enough nickel to trigger an allergic reaction. Ms Simmons said: ‘I was devastated because I had told them I was allergic to nickel and they had assured me it wouldn’t be a problem.’ Finally, after seven days the swelling began to recede but Ms Simmons noticed her face starting to smell. When she woke up from the surgery her skin was so tight that she was struggling to breathe . ‘At first I thought I’d caught a whiff of the drains. Then I realised the smell was following me around and getting worse. I broke down when I realised it was me,’ she said. After examining her surgeons discovered a large abscess eating away at her cheek and discovered that the skin around her ear was starting to die. Tests eventually revealed she had a potentially fatal infection. She was admitted to hospital and put on a strong antibiotic drip to fight the infection. Ms Simmons said: ‘I was in bits. I felt like I was being eaten alive. I was practically rotting away. I’d never been so scared in my life.’ Doctors managed to get the infection under control but one side of her face now had a sunken appearance where the inside of her cheek had rotted away, making her eyes look uneven. The infection also left severe scarring which destroyed her ear lobes. Ms Simmons developed a life-threatening infection after the surgery and had an allergic reaction to the surgical staples used during the operation . She had to be admitted to hospital to be given intravenous antibiotics and it was also discovered that she had developed an abscess in her cheek which was causing her face to smell . Ms Simmons turned down an offer from her surgeon to perform reconstructive work. ‘There was no way I was going to let him anywhere near me again. I looked like I’d been the victim of a dog attack,’ she said. As the days passed the grandmother sank into depression. She said: ‘I just hit a wall. I was so angry at the way I had been treated and angry with myself for having the surgery. ‘I refused to leave the house and kept apologising to Steve and my family for causing them so much upset and worry.’ Eventually she turned to her GP for support. Ms Simmons has now undergone seven reconstructive operations to repair the damage . As a result, the following February she began the long process of reconstructive work on the NHS. ‘The thought of going back into theatre was frightening but what choice did I have if I ever wanted to look normal?’ she said. In January 2011 Sheila accepted an out of court settlement of £10,000 compensation. She said: ‘No amount of money would ever give me back my confidence and my looks.’ She added: ‘I’m grateful that the reconstructive surgery is making a difference, but I still need more. ‘My surgeon’s explained I’ll need fat grafted from other parts of my face to try and rebuild my collapsed cheeks. ‘It’s a long process and I don’t know how I’ll feel at the end of it. I still don’t like leaving the house and will wear a scarf or turn my face away when I speak to people, especially strangers. ‘It’s ironic really. I did all this to feel better about myself and look different. Now I’d give anything to go back to looking like the old me.’ She added: ‘I thought a facelift was the answer but it was only the start of my problems. ‘So if you’re thinking of having surgery, I beg you to reconsider. Take a good look at what happened to me - what’s a few lines and wrinkles compared to this?’","Shelia Simmons, 59, had a facelift to look better for her 42-year-old partner .

"New cure: A probiotic drink derived from a Japanese pickle could help prevent flu, a study suggests . A probiotic drink made from a traditional Japanese pickle could help prevent flu, scientists have discovered. New research has suggested that the immune-boosting powers of Lactobacillus bugs found in Japanese pickled turnip, or Suguki, could help fight the virus. It is thought that the bacteria might even prevent more virulent strains of flu such as H1N1 and thedeadly H7N9 avian flu which recently emerged in China. A probiotic drink which contains the KB290 strain of the bug is now being tested on humans having tested it on mice. Fans of the vegetable have long claimed it has superfood properties but only now are scientists testing the pickle in the lab. Naoko Waki, from the Japanese food company Kagome, which carried out a study into the bacteria, said: 'Our results show that when a particular . strain of Lactobacillus brevis is eaten by mice, it has protective . effects against influenza virus infection.' The findings of the study have been published in the journal Letters in Applied Microbiology. A protective layer of sugars called . exopolysaccharides that protects the bacteria against acid stomach . juices could lie behind its powers, the Japanese researchers believe. Ms Waki said: 'We know that exopolysaccharides have . immune boosting effects in other similar bacteria, so we wonder if the . exopolysaccharides of KB290 are responsible for the effects we see.' Wonder cure? Bacteria found in Japanese pickled turnip could help to prevent flu . In the mouse study, the bacteria led the rodents' immune systems to create more flu-fighting antibodies. Scientists hope that the research may . lead to a new range of flu-fighting foods containing the bacteria to . become available on the market. Last month scientists predicted that a . new 'Holy Grail' flu vaccine which gives lifelong protection against . all strains of the virus could be available within five years. Scientists . from Britain and Europe were said to be getting ready to start large . scale trials of a universal vaccine after early successful tests on . humans. The trial programme received a multi-million pound EU grant to fund research.

"The President of the European Commission has come under fierce scrutiny today after leaked documents show hundreds of firms used Luxembourg tax avoidance deals while he was in charge of the country. Jean-Claude Juncker's previous pledge to bring some 'ethics' to Europe's tax laws is now in doubt after the documents showed more than 300 companies such as Burberry, Heinz, Dyson, Pepsi, IKEA and Deutsche Bank were among those to channel funds through the tiny European nation using complex financial structures. The European Commission said it was already probing the country’s tax practices with a review of Amazon, and would widen this inquiry in the light of new evidence. The leaked papers relate to 340 companies, including Louis Vuitton, Apple, Vodafone, Procter & Gamble and Deutsche Bank. It comes just days after Mr Juncker declared he was 'not frightened' of facing down British Prime Minister David Cameron in the latest salvo of what is becoming an increasingly public spat over Britain's EU tax bill. The so-called 'Luxleaks' documents show that billions of dollars were funneled through Luxembourg, much of it during Mr Juncker's time in charge, thanks to financial structures that allowed companies to slash their tax liabilities, depriving hard-up governments around the world of revenue. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured) presided over Luxembourg while many of the tax avoidance schemes were operating . Mr Juncker presided over the tax affairs of Luxembourg for over two decades, transforming the country from a sleepy European backwater to a prized destination where hundreds of the world's biggest companies channel their affairs. The leaks threaten to undermine his vow to be a more politically involved head of the European Commission, the EU's financial enforcer, especially as he is already embroiled in bitter rows with Cameron and Italy over their budgets. On Wednesday, asked about the tax policies he once led, Mr Juncker said he 'had his ideas' about the matter but would keep them to himself do nothing to affect the EU's investigation. The arrangements – used by hundreds of top companies - were signed off by the European Union state and are all legal. 'These revelations are a major blow to the credibility of new commission president Juncker and his capacity to act for the public interest,' said Sven Giegold, of the Greens group in the European Parliament. Mr Juncker's spokesman said the veteran politician was 'serene' about the revelations, though he pulled out of a public speaking engagement with former commission chief Jacques Delors scheduled later today. Under an hour-long barrage of questions from reporters, the spokesman stressed that EU regulators were already investigating whether Luxembourg's deals with US Internet giant Amazon and the financial arm of Italian carmaker Fiat amounted to illegal state aid. Spokesman Margaritis Schinas said that if the EU found it was in breach of the rules 'Luxembourg will have to take corrective actions'. He added that the EU could widen the probe to companies mentioned in the ICIJ investigation. Scheme: Some of the world's largest firms including top British companies like Dyson are using a Luxembourg tax avoidance scheme 'like a magical fairyland' to get out of paying billions of pounds . The leaked tax papers, analysed by the US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in a six month investigation, totall nearly 28,000 pages connected to more than 1,000 firms. Mr Cameron and Mr Juncker have been engaged in a bitter dispute in recent weeks as Mr Cameron battles to reduce the £1.7billion surcharge demanded by the EU to cover years of strong economic growth in the UK while Europe struggled. The Commission president said he was ‘not the type who trembles in front of prime ministers’ and warned Mr Cameron that he had ‘a problem’ with other EU leaders. The Prime Minister was stung last month after the budget demand was leaked during a Brussels summit. He has vowed not to pay ‘anything like’ the £1.7billion being demanded by Brussels by December 1. But the revelations are predicted to trigger more calls for politicians to work harder to stop firms taking advantage of international tax rules avoid their tax bills. The Guardian reported last night that Dyson had set up companies in the Isle of Man and Luxembourg to put £300m of internal loans into its UK operations in 2011. The interest payments made on the loans were taxed at only around one per cent in Luxembourg – saving the firm millions. The newspaper also said drugs firm Shire and city trading company Icap had also cut their tax bills with help from Luxembourg. The Guardian said the leaked papers showed 'Luxembourg was acting as a go-between, both enabling and masking tax avoidance, which always takes place beyond its borders'. President: The new president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured) - a former Luxembourg prime minister - has insisted the country is not a tax haven . In its investigation, the ICIJ said global accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers had helped multinationals in question secure at least 548 tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The documents uncovered details of so-called Advance Tax Agreements - pre-negotiated deals which set out how companies will be taxed, the same practice that the EU is investigating in the Amazon and Fiat cases. 'It's like taking your tax plan to the government and getting it blessed ahead of time,' the ICIJ quoted Connecticut School of Law tax expert Richard Pomp as saying. The EU has no power over member states' tax affairs as such, but it can probe whether they amount to illegal state aid, which breaches the 28-nation bloc's single market rules. Similar cases have been opened against Ireland for tax deals with tech giant Apple and the Netherlands with coffee chain Starbucks. The ICIJ said its investigation had involved a team of more than 80 journalists from 26 countries working for outlets including The Guardian, Le Monde and Germany's Suddeutsche Zeitung. The Guardian acknowledged in its report of the investigation that the Luxembourg arrangements were 'perfectly legal' but noted that they were enabling tax avoidance on 'an industrial scale'. Other companies that benefited from the schemes included Burberry, Procter & Gamble, Heinz, JP Morgan and FedEx. The ICIJ said some companies had been able to achieve effective tax rates of less than one percent on profits channelled through Luxembourg. Stephen Shay, a Harvard Law School professor who has held senior tax roles in the US Treasury, said: 'Clearly the database is evidencing a pervasive enabling by Luxembourg of multinationals' avoidance of taxes [around the world].' He described Luxembourg as being 'like a magical fairyland.' It comes as only last week Prime Minister David Cameron told business leaders he would not tolerate large multinational firms avoiding tax. Cracking down: Last week Prime Minister David Cameron told business leaders he would not tolerate large multinational firms avoiding tax . Mr Cameron said: 'We've cut the rate of corporation tax down to 20 per cent, we're the most competitive place to come and start a business, but here's the deal – if they have a low tax rate, those companies have damn well got to pay it.' And George Osborne is next month expected to announce new measures to stop such businesses diverting its money offshore. Juncker this summer pledged to 'try to put some morality, some ethics, into the European tax landscape'. He has also insisted the country was not a tax haven, The Guardian reported. The newspaper said the findings were put to Shire, Icap and Dyson but all three declined to answer questions and instead issued statements saying they do not engage in tax avoidance and they pay tax in the countries where profits are made. It was also reported last night that a joint venture between the Guardian Media Group and private equity group Apax Partners in 2008 also used a Luxembourg structure when it invested in magazine and events group Emap, now Top Right. A spokesman for GMG said: 'We partnered with a private equity company which regularly used such structures. A Luxembourg entity was used because Apax already had that structure in place. The fact that the parent company is a Luxembourg company does not give rise to any UK corporation tax savings for GMG.' Executives including Justin King, the former chief executive of Sainsbury's, have appeared to defend the multinationals. Mr King, who left the supermarket giant in July, said the situation was 'not black and white' and that, if people did not like the tax methods used by a particular firm, they should shop elsewhere. He said: 'They are not loopholes. They are legitimate tax systems put in place by legitimate governments legitimately elected. Taxing question: Last month, it emerged that Facebook had not paid any corporation tax in the UK for a second year in a row, despite recording sales of £50million . 'It is wrong to lay that at the door of companies operating their business in a structure… constructed by government. 'The first thing you have got to do is hold governments to account for putting those structures in place; that we have seen in Ireland. 'The Irish have come to the conclusion that the 'double Irish' is not acceptable in their own parliament.' Last month, it emerged that Facebook had not paid any corporation tax in the UK for a second year in a row, despite recording sales of £50million, after pushing much of its revenues through a complex scheme in Ireland.","European Union Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker under fire .

Areola reduction surgery is aimed at women who are unhappy with either the size or shape of their areolae, the brown or pink area surrounding the nipple. Women who are insecure about the size or shape of brown or pink area surrounding their nipples are resorting to surgery . Some women believe their areolae are too wide, raised, non-circular or uneven in colour and are now resorting to surgery to tackle the problem. The procedure is performed by removing a circular area of the outer area of the areola and bringing in the skin around it to reduce and tighten it. Absorbable stitches are used inside the areola to reduce the diameter. In many cases, surgeons will use a permanent stitch which they place deep in the breast tissue to prevent the areola from widening after surgery. One woman who is considering surgery said her nipples has been compared 'Hob Nob biscuits' Helena, 33, who lives in London, who had been hiding her nipple insecurity for years was ecstatic when she heard about the surgery. She said ‘As soon as I hit puberty I . realised my nipples were unlike other girls. They just got bigger and . bigger – and they were much darker than my friends’ nipples. ‘Getting changed for swimming was mortifying – I was worried everyone was looking at me. ‘My first boyfriend jokingly compared . them to Hob Nob biscuits. He meant it fondly but that description stayed . with me – and I’ve never been able to move on from it. I’ve felt . self-conscious with every man I’ve ever undressed in front of. ‘They have also been compared to . Scotch pancakes. They are so disproportionately large - it makes me so . paranoid. Leteysha Grace, of MTV's The Valleys, was so upset by comments about her breasts that she's now considering nipple reduction surgery . 'I don’t feel at all sexy with my top off. I can’t imagine how . any man could find them attractive. ‘My friend told me her nipples got . larger and darker when she was pregnant and breastfeeding. The very . thought fills me with fear. ‘I’d never heard about nipple reduction surgery before  - I thought I was stuck with them. ‘Now that I know it exists I’m going to save up to have it done.’ The surgery involves removing skin from the outer area of the areola . And Helena is not alone - Leteysha Grace, of MTV's The Valleys, is considering the surgery after suffering at the hands of bullies. Leteysha was horrified by the onslaught of abuse she received on Twitter after she appeared topless in a Zoo magazine shoot. Speaking to Heat magazine, she said: 'I'm having my nipples corrected because I'm not happy with the way my boobs look. 'I can't even take my bra off during sex. I don't know if I'll still have sensitivity after the surgery, but, to be honest, I don't really care.' However, a loss of sensation isn't the main issue with this type of surgery. Miles Berry, co-author of The Good Boob Bible explains: 'If too much skin is removed, scars can stretch so expectations are a key part of preoperative discussions. The average areola is approximately 4.5 . cm in diameter. Sometimes an enlarged areola is caused by the natural . sagging of breasts due to age or breast-feeding . 'However, I feel the trend is growing and results are usually very good, if the above points are taken into consideration.' Plastic surgeon Dr. Yannis Alexandrides, founder of clinic 111 Harley Street, said of the surgery: 'Women who are self conscious because they have large areolae, need not worry because there is a simple correction that can be performed under local anaesthetic. 'An average areola is approximately 4.5 cm in diameter. Sometimes a large areola goes together with natural sagging of breasts due to age or breast-feeding. 'If you want to have a breast reduction or a breast lift done, the areola may be reduced at the same time to the desired size. An areola reduction can also be performed without additional surgery. 'Through an incision in the outer part of the nipple of the areola, the pigmented skin around the nipple or areola is removed. This procedure may leave a small scar around the areola. 'An areola reduction does not cause any problems with future breast feeding.' Dr. Yannis Alexandrides said: 'Women who are self conscious because they have large areolae need not worry because there is a simple correction that can be performed under local anaesthetic'","Women now resorting to surgery to alter size or shape of the areola - the darker area surrounding the nipple .

"Debate: Mr Cable said Britain did not have a 'vast problem' with illegal immigration . The Coalition was at war over immigration last night after Vince Cable accused the Tories of trying to stoke up a ‘sense of fear’. The Liberal Democrat Business Secretary said Conservative ministers were ‘obsessing’ about immigration numbers. He dismissed reports that there are now more than a million illegal immigrants in this country, saying: ‘The idea there’s some vast hidden army of people is almost certainly wrong.’ And he attacked a controversial Home . Office poster campaign urging illegal immigrants to ‘go home or face . arrest’, questioning whether the targets of the posters would even . understand them. Mr Cable said the Lib Dems had not . been consulted about the van campaign – and suggested it was a cynical . attempt by the Conservatives to stoke up public fears about immigration. He said: ‘It was stupid and it’s . offensive. It is designed, apparently, to sort of create a sense of fear . in the British population that we have a vast problem with illegal . immigration. We have a problem, but it’s got to be dealt with in a . measured way by dealing with the underlying causes.’ He questioned whether illegal . immigrants would have enough of a ‘sophisticated grasp of English’ to be . able to read the posters on the vans at a distance. His comments grew an angry response from senior Tories last night. A source close to Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘Vince Cable clearly has no idea how to manage illegal immigration.’ The source defended the £10,000 poster . campaign, pointing out it costs an average of £15,000 to deport a . single illegal immigrant. ‘If we can persuade them to go voluntarily . there are huge savings to be made.’ Scroll down for video . Attack: Business Secretary Vince Cable slammed a Tory scheme to crackdown on illegal immigrants by driving a van with an advert on around London . Tory MP Mark Reckless, a member of the . Commons Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘Rather than a culture of fear, . we are creating a culture of action on illegal immigration. If Vince . Cable doesn’t agree with government policy in this area, it is always . open to him to resign.’ Fellow Tory Nick de Bois said the Lib . Dems appeared to be ‘divorced from reality’ on immigration. He added: . ‘It is absolute nonsense to suggest anyone is trying to create a climate . of fear. All Vince Cable is doing is repeating the mistakes of the past . by trying to close down a frank, honest and constructive debate about . illegal immigration.’ Mr Cable also criticised David . Cameron’s pledge to cut annual net immigration from more than 200,000 to . under 100,000, adding: ‘Obsessing about this net immigration figure is . not helpful.’ The Home Office’s illegal immigration . initiative was piloted in six London boroughs last week but could be . rolled out nationally if it proves successful. The blunt message has also been displayed in leaflets, posters and messages in local newspapers. Controversial: Adverts urging illegal immigrants to go home were driven around London on vans, but they have only resulted in a total of 11 migrants leaving the country, according to the Home Office's own figures . Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper . branded the poster campaign a ‘cynical stunt’ and said there was . ‘complete confusion’ over whether the billboards represented government . policy. She added: ‘With no consultation with local communities the Government has simply caused offence with these ill-judged ad vans. ‘They seem to be aimed at lost Tory voters rather than a sensible strategy to tackle illegal immigration. ‘Now Cabinet ministers are openly . disagreeing. Vince Cable is right – they are stupid – but why then is . the Government sticking by them, instead of getting the basics right . with a proper plan for efficient border enforcement?’","Vince Cable criticised Tory move to send out adverts on vans .

"Activists have accused Google of being racist and sexist in their choice of figures to create the firm's much loved Google Doodles for. Spark, which describes itself as a 'girl-fueled activist movement', said its analysis found the majority of Google's doodles were of white males. It said the accolade was the modern equivalent of being put on a stamp, and said 'it’s uncommon for Google to celebrate historical women of color.' Researchers from Spark found 62% of Doodles where of white males - with just 4% black women . In 1998, before the company was even incorporated, the concept of the doodle was born when Google founders Larry and Sergey played with the corporate logo to indicate their attendance at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. They placed a stick figure drawing behind the 2nd 'o' in the word, Google, and the revised logo was intended as a comical message to Google users that the founders were 'out of office.' While the first doodle was relatively simple, the idea of decorating the company logo to celebrate notable events was born. It says its investigation was sparked in January when Google featured author Zora Neale Hurston on its U.S. homepage. The doodle was a huge success. 'Here’s a theory: maybe it was special because it’s one of the few times that the Internet saw Google honor a black woman on its front page,' Spark's Celeste Montaño said in a blog post. 'Maybe it was special because it’s uncommon for Google to celebrate historical women of color.' Although they began as a way for Google's founders to tell visitors they were visiting the Burning Man festival, they have become an online tradition. Google Doodles range from drawings and animations to full games that replace the Google logo on holidays or birthdays of historical figures. Sometimes the Doodles are seen worldwide, but mostly they’re reserved for the country in which the holiday or individual is best known, as was the case with Hurston—her Doodle was only visible on Google’s U.S. homepage. The very first Doodle to celebrate an individual appeared in 2001 in honor of Monet, but the Doodles didn’t start making frequent appearances on Google’s homepage until around 2010, . 'For a while now, we at SPARK have noticed that white men get featured on the Google homepage all the time, whereas women of color are rarely honored. Zora Neale Hurston, one of the pre-eminent writers of twentieth-century African-American literature was recently honoured with a Google Doodle . 'But it wasn’t until September 2013 that we set out to find the exact numbers.' The team analysed hundreds of Google Doodles for months. 'It turns out that from 2010-2013, Google celebrated 445 individuals on its various homepages throughout the world. 1 . '9 were women of color, 54 were white women, 82 were men of color, and an overwhelming 275 were white men. 'About half of those 19 women of color appeared in 2013 alone, so at least we can say there’s been some progress.' Spark also said there hasn’t been a single Asian, Latina, or indigenous woman featured in a Global Doodle as of February 2014. The organisation today called for Google to take action. Carlos Juan Finlay, the Cuban physician and scientist recognized as a pioneer in the research of yellow fever was also recently the recipient of a Google Doodle . Kristian Olaf Birkeland, the Norwegian scientist who explained the Aurora borealis was recently honoured . 'We’re demanding that Google make a concerted effort to change such a blatant imbalance. 'We want them to acknowledge the problem, but we also want more: we want Google to publicly commit to improving these numbers.' 'Google Doodles may seem lighthearted, especially when accompanied by quirky games and animation, but in reality they have emerged as a new manifestation of who we value as a society, a sign of who “matters.” 'Just like statues, stamps, and national holidays, you know that if someone is featured on Google’s homepage, they’ve done something important.' It called for the Doodles to include all races and genders. 'Women, people of color, people with disabilities, queer people, trans people. 'We’re asking Google to draw our histories, our achievements, our strength, our heroes, our fighters and foremothers. You can’t keep ignoring us. We’re here, and we’ve always been here.' Google said it already is working to improve the doodle gender balance. Ryan Germick, Doodle Team Lead, told MailOnline: 'Women have historically been underrepresented in almost all fields: science, school curricula, business, politics -- and, sadly, doodles. 'We’ve been working to fix the imbalance in our doodles -- this year we're hoping to have women and men equally represented. 'So far this year we’ve done doodles for as many women as men, a big shift from figures below 20% in past years.' The organisation launched a campaign today to try and persuade Google to be more diverse with its doodles .","Organisation claims it is 'uncommon for Google to celebrate women of color'

"There’s nothing like the prospect of a new Tesco store to inspire a little healthy – and often heated – debate in a community. However, things took a downright sinister turn in one town after locals had their say online. Comments made on a blog run by one Tory councillor and on the Facebook page of another have been the subject of a criminal investigation. Seaside town: Senior officers warned three Tory councillors they could be prosecuted for harassment during campaigning for a new Tesco in Margate, Kent (file picture) Police even questioned a third councillor who merely ‘liked’ a post – the act of clicking a thumbs up icon to show approval. Now senior officers have warned the three men they could be prosecuted for harassment over their involvement in  the debate. One . councillor accused Kent Police of acting like ‘North Korea’ and said . their behaviour could stifle legitimate debate over other controversial . proposals. The inquiry was . prompted after a bed and breakfast owner accused the men of targeting . her over her outspoken opposition to the supermarket in Margate, Kent. Councillor Dr Simon Moores, who was interviewed over comments made by . third parties on his Thanet Life blog, could end up with a . criminal record if he is prosecuted. ‘My fear . is if members of the public start using criminal law to go after . councillors because they disagree with something – then what is the . point of public service?’ he said. Run down: Empty shops on Margate High Street. The town was selected for a six-figure cash injection as one of 12 regeneration schemes across the country . ‘It . is very Orwellian. Frankly it is like something out of North Korea . because the police have yet to come to grips with social media. ‘There . is the danger of veering on the heavy side when dealing with a . complaint and not being able to clearly define where the law stands.’ Councillor: Dr Simon Moores, who has commented about the store in his blog Thanetlife, was questioned under caution for conspiracy to harass . The saga over the 82,000sq ft supermarket, a stone’s throw from the seafront, dates back several years. The . ‘yes’ campaign say it will bring jobs and revitalise the area, while . those in the ‘no’ camp said it will damage the town’s revival and high . street stores. Progress . came to a halt after an appeal was lodged at the High Court against a . green light given by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles last year. Entrepreneur . Louise Oldfield, who also runs a B&B, complained she was being . harassed over her persistent opposition to the plans. She claimed she was the victim of online comments, some of which were made using pseudonyms. Police . visited Dr Moores, former Margate mayor Mick Tomlinson and a third . councillor and interviewed them all under caution on suspicion of . harassment. They examined comments posted by third parties on Dr Moores’s blog. These . included claims Miss Oldfield had been ‘blinkered’ and referred to her . ‘humiliating’ defeat after she stood as an independent in a county . council election. Spirited: Rival Facebook groups supporting and opposing the supermarket have sprung up . Police . also looked at the Facebook pages of Mr Tomlinson, on which he suggested . Miss Oldfield exaggerated the size and position of the supermarket. 'It is very Orwellian.

The third councillor, who has not been identified, was questioned after he ‘liked’ Mr Tomlinson’s post. Dr .

But the raccoon behind him isn't quite so confident, putting its paws protectively around a smaller raccoon as it inspects the human who will get them out. These adorable photos were taken in Albany, New York, after resident Danique Peynado went to take the rubbish out with her boyfriend. Scroll down for video . 'What took you so long?'  The trapped - and hungry - raccoons look less than welcoming as salvation arrives . As she opened the lid to throw the trash into the dumpster, she stopped when she saw four pairs of beseeching eyes looking up at her. The raccoons had got themselves trapped overnight while foraging for food in the large green bin, but were not at all sure about the people who wanted to help them out. Ms Peynado and her boyfriend Jeff made a ramp for the notoriously shy creatures out of cardboard and retreated to give the animals the confidence to come out. The raccoons emerged blinking in the morning sunshine and then fled, probably to the next garbage bin. Dumpsters are a popular source of food for raccoons, who tend not to think before they leap, and who are usually able to climb onto rubbish to get out once they have eaten enough. But when the dumpster has recently been emptied, as this one had, there is nothing to climb onto - let alone eat - and the scavengers are stuck until a kind-hearted human comes and helps them out. Raccoons are shy but clever - studies have shown they learn which night trash is put out in a neighbourhood . Now how do we get down?

"Ed Miliband today accused TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson of ‘belittling’ people with mental health problems. The Labour leader used a speech in central London to criticise the Top Gear host, who he claimed was responsible for promoting a culture of ‘intolerance’. Mr Mililband said stars were wrong to make light of mental illness, as he unveiled plans to tackle what he called ‘the biggest unaddressed health challenge of our age’. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband criticised celebrities who 'belittle' people with mental health problems . In a speech at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Labour leader set out what he called a One Nation approach to mental health . He praised the example of people like cricketer Marcus Trescothick and television presenter Stephen Fry for speaking out about their battles with depression. But he said ‘far too often’ there was ‘scepticism and abuse’ that reinforced the taboo about mental health meaning many people who struggle with it do not feel able to discuss it or seek help. ‘It's not just casual name calling in the streets or the school playground. There are still people who abuse the privilege of their celebrity to insult, demean and belittle others,’ he said in a speech at the Royal College of Psychiatrists. He added: ‘Jeremy Clarkson, who may have at least have acknowledged the tragedy of people who end their own lives, goes on to call them ""Johnny Suicides"" whose bodies should be left on train tracks rather than delay journeys. ‘It is attitudes like these that reinforce the stigma that blights millions of people's lives, and holds our country back. 'The fight against racism, against . sexism and against homophobia, made the acceptable unacceptable. So we . should join the fight against this intolerance. It is wrong, it costs . Britain dear, and it has to change.’ Mr Miliband criticised celebrities like Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson who made fun of people with a mental illness . Jeremy Clarkson caused controversy last December after criticising people who kill themselves on train lines. The . notorious presenter said that anyone who committed suicide in this way . was 'very selfish' for traumatising train drivers and inconveniencing . commuters. The outburst came just days after a joke about executing public . sector workers for going on strike cause outcry. In a newspaper column he . wrote that killing oneself by jumping in front of a train 'is a very . selfish way to go because the disruption it causes is immense.' He went on to label those who killed themselves 'Johnny Suicide'. Clarkson claimed that train drivers involved in these cases are . 'traumatised for life', and complained that passengers would 'have to . sit around for hours'. And . he added that trains should not wait until all the remains of the body . had been removed from tracks, saying - grotesquely - that drivers should . instead 'get the train moving as soon as possible and let foxy woxy and . the birds nibble away at the smaller, gooey parts that are far away and . hard to find.' However, in . his article for The Sun Mr Clarkson stressed that he had 'the deepest . sympathy for anyone whose life is so mangled and messed up that they . believe death's icy embrace will be better. He accepted that politicians had also largely failed to take a lead on the issue. ‘For far too long leading politicians from all parties, including my own, have maintained an almost complete silence about mental health,’ he said. Mental illness creates additional costs for the NHS of £10 billion in the provision of extra physical care, while the wider economy loses £26 billion a year to sickness absence, replacing staff and reduced productivity caused, he said. 'Now there will be some people who say that mental health is the kind of subject we can talk about in the good times, but not when the economy is such a priority. 'In my view, that is the opposite of the truth. Because mental health is an economic challenge holding back prosperity. 'Because however hard the economic challenges, we cannot forget about people's quality of life. And, finally, if we want a politics that talks directly to the challenges that British people face in their everyday lives, we cannot allow the silence to continue.' Mr Miliband announced the creation of a taskforce headed by the chair of Barts NHS Trust, Stephen O'Brien, to draw up a strategic plan for mental health in society.

"The world’s first mobile team to administer euthanasia in patients’ homes will be launched next month. Units will be dispatched when family doctors refuse to administer lethal drugs on ‘ethical’ grounds. They are expected to send the number of euthanasia cases in Holland soaring, with pro-campaigners claiming they will end the lives of an additional 1,000 patients a year. No way back: The units will euthanise patients by administering a strong sedative to put them in a coma, followed by a drug to stop them breathing . Officially, 2,700 Dutch people a year choose assisted suicide, but critics say the real figure is far higher. The launch of the first unit, which will consist of at least a doctor and a nurse, was confirmed on Radio Netherlands by the country’s Right to Die Association. The group confirmed the unit in The Hague will be the first of six that will target borderline cases in which family GPs are reluctant to administer euthanasia. It is likely to be used with mentally ill patients or those with early dementia, involving the patient’s GP only 'if possible', the association has said. The group has previously claimed that 80 per cent of people with dementia or mental illnesses were being 'missed' by the country’s euthanasia laws. But the Federation of Dutch Physicians fears the teams may end the lives of people who could be treated. ‘In the worst cases, people could die who perhaps could have received some other help,’ a spokesman said. In Britain, Phyllis Bowman of Right to Life said she was 'absolutely appalled' by the development. 'This is a real tragedy when you consider that in the Second World War the Dutch refused to implement the Nazi euthanasia programme.' She added: 'People here should be warned that if we allowed euthanasia they might have a mobile unit at their door at some time.' The units, which are backed by the Dutch government, must conform to the 2002 law that made Holland the first country in the world to allow euthanasia since Nazi Germany. Value of life: Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams said this week that it would be a 'disaster' if assisted suicide was legalised in Britain . This law stipulates that a person can only quality for euthanasia if their suffering is lasting and unbearable. The units were first revealed by Health Minister Edith Schippers in the Dutch parliament late last year. She said that units 'for patients who meet the criteria for euthanasia but whose doctors are unwilling to carry it out' was worthy of consideration. In Holland, euthanasia is carried out by administering a strong sedative to put the patient in a coma, followed by a drug to stop breathing and cause death. The Dutch government insists 'the greatest care' is taken to offer euthanasia only to patients 'who are suffering unbearably with no prospect of improvement'. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, said in a General Synod debate this week that it would be a ‘disaster’ if assisted suicide was legalised in Britain. 'To change the law on this subject is, I believe, to change something vital in our sense of the value of life itself,' he said.","Teams will end the lives of additional 1,000 a year .

"Storm: Cardinal Peter Turkson has faced a backlash after blaming gay priests for the clerical abuse crisis . The African cardinal widely tipped to be the first black pope in modern history faced a firestorm of criticism last night after he laid the blame for clerical sex abuse crises at the feet of gay priests. Cardinal Peter Turkson, who comes from Ghana, told an American journalist that similar sex scandals would never convulse churches in Africa because the culture was inimical to homosexuality. ‘African traditional systems kind of protect or have protected its population against this tendency,’ he told Christiane Amanpour of CCN. ‘Because in several communities, in several cultures in Africa homosexuality or for that matter any affair between two sexes of the same kind, are not countenanced in our society,’ he continued. ‘So that cultural taboo, that tradition has been there,’ said Cardinal Turkson, 64. ‘It has served to keep it out.’ As the head of a major Vatican department – the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace - Cardinal Turkson is ranked as the 5/2 second favourite to take the papal crown when a Conclave of Cardinals meets next month to elect a successor to Pope Benedict XVI, who announced his abdication last week on the grounds of ill health . Catholics throughout the African continent and the developing world are praying that he will be chosen ahead of the Italian Cardinal Angelo Scola, the Archbishop of Milan, who Paddy Power has made its 9/4 favourite. But his public comments blaming homosexual priests in for the sexual abuse of many hundreds of children in Europe, the United States and Australia mean his election would be severely criticised in the West. Ruth Hunt, Stonewall director of public affairs, was among those to swiftly condemn his remarks. ‘Cardinal Turkson’s comments show a surprisingly callous disregard for the human rights of millions of people worldwide,’ she told the Times. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests accused the cardinal of hiding behind a ‘weak shield’. Outgoing: Cardinal Turkson is favourite to replace Pope Benedict XVI, pictured, who announced he will be standing down at the end of the month . A spokesman said: ‘We hear less about clergy sex crimes and cover ups in Africa for the same reasons we do throughout the developing world - there tends to be lesser funding for law enforcement, less vigorous civil justice systems, less independent journalism, and an even greater power and wealth difference between church officials and their congregants.’ But one NHS psychiatrist who has researched the field of clerical sex abuse agreed with the cardinal that homosexual abuse of adolescent males rather than paedophile attacks on children characterised the problem. Tipped: Italian cardinal Angelo Scola Is favourite to take over from Benedict XVI . ‘I would say he is correct,’ said the doctor, who asked not to be named in fear of reprisals - including the loss of his job. ‘Where the research has been done – for example in the United States and Australia – in the region of 80 per cent of the victims of sex abuse by priests are adolescent males rather than children.’ Pope Benedict XVI has been careful to avoid publicly demonising gay priests over the crisis, focusing instead on meeting and apologising to victims. Very soon into his pontificate, however, he tightened up the Church’s recruitment rules to make it nearly impossible for gay men to enter seminaries as trainee priests. In a possible further indication of the Vatican thinking, one of his most senior cardinals also laid the blame for the abuse crisis squarely at the feet of gay priests. Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican Secretary of State – and the 5/1 third favourite to succeed Benedict XVI -  said that some psychiatrists had found a relationship between homosexuality and paedophilia. ‘That is the problem,’ he said. Amid the backlash, the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales issued a statement contradicting the cardinal by arguing that ‘there is no empirical data which concludes that sexual orientation is connected to child sexual abuse’. Cardinal Turkson is no stranger to controversy, having offended Muslims last year by accusing them of turning Europe into an Islamic continent.","Cardinal Peter Turkson made the comments to an American journalist .

Chocolate was smeared over the child's face and a washing-up sponge stuck on his head to copy the striker's Mohawk hair. A picture of the baby, who even sports the footballer's slogan 'Why Always Me?', was then posted on the Internet sparking outrage last night. The photo was retweeted 2,000 times. Outrage: The baby's face was smeared in chocolate and a sponge stuck on his head to resemble Balotelli . Jim C posted on Twitter: 'You thought you'd seen it all. Dear me.' While another said: 'Parents tweeted ghastly picture of baby dressed as Mario Balotelli, this must be child abuse.' Matt Bishop added: 'Jesus wept, who does this to their child!?!?!?!?' Parenting expert Sue Atkins, author of Parenting Made Easy: How To Raise Happy Children, told the Sunday Mirror: 'Just looking at this picture makes me very uncomfortable, especially the fact the child is blacked up. I don't like it at all.' It is believed the photo was uploaded by a Manchester United fan on Instagram. Balotelli, from Italy, left Manchester City to play for AC Milan after helping the club to win its first title in 44 years. Last month a 10-year-old Leeds United fan caused outrage after he blacked up to pose with his hero El Hadji Diouf. Backlash: The baby was made up to look like Mario Balotelli and even has the slogan 'Why Always Me?' on his baby grow . The child posted a series of pictures on his Twitter account provoking a backlash from users who said he was racist. But the primary school child said he did not realise it would be offensive and did it as a tribute to his footballing hero. The boy's father was forced to take to his son's Twitter account to defend him from accusations of racism. He wrote: 'I want to apologise if [my son] dressing up has caused offence. The fan met his favourite player outside Elland Road ahead of his team's home game against Bolton Wanderers on New Year's Day. He said Diouf and other Leeds players found the 'costume' - a blacked up face and head, Leeds kit and white mohican - funny. As well as Diouf, the child posed with Leeds' captain Lee Peltier and players Ryan Hall and Sam Byram. The child also said midfielder Paul Green said to him: 'How cool do you look?' The fan posted pictures of him with Leeds United manager Neil Warnock, who he said found it funny, and police officers outside the ground. The boy also got to meet his hero once more in the tunnel. Smiling: The super fan poses with his hero El Hadji Diouf but others did not find the photo amusing . Ahead of the game he tweeted: 'Theres only 2 El-Hadji Dioufs...this is how I've come dressed today.' After the pictures were posted, Twitter users took to the social networking site accusing the child of racism. Within hours the pictures had been seen by people across the world. Leeds fan: The child was also pictured with Leeds captain Lee Peltier, left, and Ryan Hall, right . In January former Manchester United striker Ruud Van Nistelrooy 'blacked up for a festival' in Spain. And last year Robbie Fowler tweeted a picture of himself made up like Lionel Richie. Manchester City Football Club have so far declined to comment on the picture.","Chocolate was smeared over the child's face and a washing-up sponge stuck on his head .

"A 20-year-old man who posted a vile Facebook message saying ‘all soldiers should die and go to hell’ just two days after six British soldiers were killed in Afghanistan has today avoided jail. Azhar Ahmed, of Ravensthorpe, West Yorkshire, admitted posting the message - and was charged after the mother of one of the soldiers read the comments and was so upset she called police. Nathalie Taylor, mother of Corporal Jake Hartley, 20, said she was ‘physically sick’ after reading the comments and that Ahmed ‘completely disrespected his memory and those of his fellow soldiers’. Avoids jail: Azhar Ahmed, of Ravensthorpe, West Yorkshire, admitted posting the message - and was charged after the mother of one of the soldiers read the comments and was so upset she called police . The remarks were also called ‘derogatory, disrespectful and inflammatory’ by a district judge at Huddersfield Magistrates’ Court who found him guilty of sending a grossly offensive communication. Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33, Cpl Hartley, 20, Private Anthony Frampton, 20, Pte Christopher Kershaw, 19, Pte Daniel Wade, 20, and Pte Daniel Wilford, 21, died in a blast in Kandahar province in March. Ahmed told a trial he did not think what he had written was offensive. His message said: ‘People gassin about the deaths of Soldiers! What about the innocent familys who have been brutally killed. ‘The women who have been raped. The children who have been sliced up! Your enemy’s were the Taliban not innocent harmful familys. All soldiers should DIE & go to HELL! THE LOWLIFE F****N SCUM! ‘Gotta problem. Go cry at your soldiers grave and wish him hell because that’s where he is going.’ Distraught: Nathalie Taylor (left), mother of Corporal Jake Hartley (right), 20, said she was ‘physically sick’ after reading the comments and Ahmed ‘completely disrespected his memory and those of his fellow soldiers’ Ahmed told the court at his trial last month that he deleted the post as soon as he realised what reaction it was having. 'The women who have been raped. The children who have been sliced up! Your enemy’s were the Taliban not innocent harmful familys. All soldiers should DIE & go to HELL! THE LOWLIFE F****N SCUM!' Azhar Ahmed's Facebook comments . He said he replied with apologies to many people who commented on his page and when some told him they had lost relatives in Afghanistan he realised how serious it was. But he denied the message was grossly offensive and said he thought it would just have been upsetting and caused distress. The trial heard that the parents of one of the six soldiers who died in the incident saw the posting, which was copied around the internet. During today’s sentencing at Huddersfield Magistrates’ Court, Nicholas Barker, defending Ahmed, said it was a ‘serious matter’ but not one that warranted custody. Six killed: (top left to right) Sergeant Nigel Coupe, Corporal Jake Hartley and Private Anthony Frampton, with (bottom left to right) Private Christopher Kershaw, Private Daniel Wade and Private Daniel Wilford . He said Ahmed was initially voicing . ‘legitimate concerns’ about the victims of war but went on to overstep . the mark. When he realised his latter comments were causing distress, he . removed them, Mr Barker added. 'He (Cpl Hartley) gave his life for this country then in such a short time Ahmed has completely disrespected his memory and those of his fellow soldiers' Nathalie Taylor, mother of Cpl Hartley . District Judge Jane Goodwin said the law should not stop legitimate political opinions being strongly voiced. But she said the test was whether what was written was ‘beyond the pale of what’s tolerable in our society’. She ruled Ahmed’s posting was not tolerable and said: ‘I’m satisfied that the message was grossly offensive’. He was given a two-year community order with 240 hours of community service and ordered to pay £300 in costs at today’s hearing. Outside court, Mrs Taylor criticised the sentence, saying: ‘He should have been sent to jail. They should have made an example of him to ensure other people realise that they just can't do this. Sorry: Ahmed said he replied with apologies to many people who commented on his page and when some told him they had lost relatives in Afghanistan he realised how serious it was (file picture) ‘I'm happy that he has been caught and sentenced. Though I wish he had gone to jail, it sounds like he is going to be paying back the community.’ 'It was so upsetting for me to see that and it was very hard for the family to deal with. I went completely numb and fortunately can't recall the wording' Mrs Taylor . But she added that she found the ‘sick message’ less than 24 hours after finding out her son had died, and ‘completely lost it for around an hour and was physically sick’. Mrs Taylor said: ‘It was so upsetting for me to see that and it was very hard for the family to deal with. I went completely numb and fortunately can't recall the wording. ‘I just remember feeling sick and upset. He (Cpl Hartley) gave his life for this country then in such a short time Ahmed has completely disrespected his memory and those of his fellow soldiers. ‘It's very easy to sit behind your computer writing whatever you please when there are soldiers fighting for the freedom of speech which these people hide behind.’","Community order for Azhar Ahmed, from Ravensthorpe, West Yorkshire .

"Summer may have officially arrived, but not at Lake Superior. A Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources warden discovered some icebergs still afloat in Lake Superior near Madeline Island. Amie Egstad spotted the floating ice – which was covered in resting seagulls – while doing a routine check of commercial nets in the largest of the Great Lakes. The sight was at odds with data released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at the weekend, which declared all of the Great Lakes ice-free.

However, due to the harsh winter that gripped most of America this year and the polar vortex, the ice lasted into June. In March, the Great Lakes were 92.5 percent frozen. NOAA reported that the ice has never lasted this late in the year, based on their data. 'We saw the ice as early as November 25 and now into June,' NOAA scientist George Leshkevich told the Washington Post. 'In terms of duration I would think it's up there, if not at the top of the chart [in the historic record].' Mr Egstad said he was shocked to still see icebergs, considering temperatures in the area sitting around 70 degrees. But the temperatures are not strong enough to melt the ice. 'There was this big iceberg along with other ice packs and bergs floating around backside of Madeline Island area east towards Saxon Harbor,' Mr Egstad told CBS Minnesota.

"Speaking about the abortion scandal, Jim Dobbin, Labour MP for Heywood and Middleton, said: 'It's a mockery' Dozens of doctors found to be signing off abortions for women they had never met will not face any disciplinary action, it was revealed yesterday. The 67 doctors were identified in an investigation by NHS watchdog the Care Quality Commission as having illegally signed blank abortion forms, which should be filled in only once they have a thorough understanding of a woman's circumstances. One of the doctors had signed so many blank forms that they were still being used by the abortion clinic four years after he left. All 67 were referred to the General Medical Council but a Freedom of Information request has now established that none of them will be brought before a fitness to practise hearing, where they could be disciplined, suspended, or struck off. The GMC has also refused to pass the names to the police, even though the offence can merit a jail sentence. MPs say the figures are evidence of a society where 'abortion is on demand' and have accused watchdogs of covering up the crimes of doctors who remain free to practise. By law, a woman can have an abortion only if two doctors sign a form having agreed that continuing the pregnancy could cause her physical or emotional harm. The Government advises that at least one doctor has seen the woman – and at the very least, they should have thoroughly read her medical notes or spoken to her on the phone. But the CQC found that at least 67 doctors working at private and NHS clinics had pre-signed abortion forms without even knowing the names of the women they would be used for. Jim Dobbin, Labour MP for Heywood and Middleton, said: 'This is clear evidence of the abortion-on-demand culture throughout the medical establishment. 'Sixty-seven doctors happily referred for abortions without knowing a single thing about the woman requesting them. Worse, at the very top, senior doctors and lawyers at the GMC decided to keep these crimes to themselves. This shames the GMC and makes a mockery of the Abortion Act.' David Burrowes, the Tory MP for Enfield Southgate and parliamentary chairman of the Conservative Christian Fellowship, said: 'There is something frightening about this. By law, a woman can have an abortion only if two doctors sign a form having agreed that continuing the pregnancy could cause her physical or emotional harm (stock picture) Abortions can legally be performed under certain conditions. The first is that continuing with the pregnancy involves a greater risk to the physical or mental health of the woman, or her existing children, than having a termination. The woman's 'actual or reasonably foreseeable future environment' may be taken into account. A non-emergency abortion must be agreed by two doctors  – or one in an emergency – and carried out by a doctor in a  Government-approved hospital or clinic. The two doctors who give their consent must work for either an NHS clinic or GP  surgery, or at a private provider affiliated to the Health Service, such as Marie Stopes or BPAS,  the British Pregnancy Advisory Service. Staff also have a duty to provide impartial and objective counselling. In September 2011, MPs rejected an attempt by Tory MP Nadine Dorries to stop abortion providers giving NHS-funded counselling to women. 'It says something about how sinister and unaccountable abortion practice in the UK has become that such a large number of doctors could brazenly break the law and the most senior medical establishment in the land omit to refer their crimes to the police.' The CQC carried out spot checks on 250 private and NHS abortion clinics in 2012 after it emerged that some doctors had been letting women terminate their pregnancies simply because the foetus was the 'wrong' sex. An undercover investigation for the Daily Telegraph filmed consultant Prabha Sivaraman, who worked for both private clinics and NHS hospitals in Manchester, telling a woman: 'I don't ask questions. If you want a termination, you want a termination.' Dr Raj Mohan, who worked at the private Calthorpe Clinic in Edgbaston, Birmingham, was also filmed agreeing to conduct the procedure even though he told the woman: 'It's like female infanticide, isn't it?' Both doctors are being investigated by the GMC, although they will not face criminal charges because the Crown Prosecution Service said it would not be in the public interest. The CQC said that during the course of its investigations its inspectors had found piles of pre-signed forms at some clinics. One was still using forms signed by a doctor who had left four years before. The Daily Mail used Freedom of Information requests to obtain figures from the GMC on the numbers of doctors referred to them for pre-signing forms following the CQC investigation. But the GMC refused to reveal the names of any of the doctors or give details about their exact job titles or where they practise. Professor Jack Scarisbrick, chairman of Life, the pro-life pregnancy counselling charity, said: 'I think it is utterly disgraceful that the GMC hasn't pursued these doctors. 'How can anyone say that they are acting in “good faith” when they sign, in advance, forms authorising a serious medical intervention?' Lord Campbell-Savours, a Labour peer, said: 'Whatever one's position on abortion, for or against, we can all agree on one simple principle: The law passed by Parliament should be enforced.'","67 doctors were identified in an investigation by NHS watchdog .

"Offending fruit: An atheist society at Reading University were ejected from the freshers' fair after displaying a pineapple labelled with the name of the Prophet Mohammed . A group of atheist students were thrown out of their freshers' fair because they included a pineapple labelled 'Mohammed' on their stall. The Reading University Atheist, Humanist and Secularist Society (RAHS) said they wanted to celebrate free speech and promote their upcoming debate 'Should we respect religion?' But they were ordered to remove the offending fruit by union staff who said their actions were causing 'upset and distress' to a number of Muslim students and other societies. RAHS refused, citing that they had labelled the pineapple after the Islamic prophet to 'encourage discussion about blasphemy, religion, and liberty'. A spokesman said: 'We wanted to celebrate the fact that we live in a country in which free speech is protected and where it is lawful to call a pineapple by whatever name one chooses.' They claimed the union then issued them with the ultimatum: 'Either the pineapple goes or you do.' According to RAHS, a group of students surrounded their stall and removed the pineapple's name tag before the society was 'forced to leave the venue' accompanied by security, it was reported in the Huffington Post. Rupert Sutton, who blogs on Student Rights, a website which claims to 'tackle extremism on campuses', said the student union was wrong to censor the society. He said: 'Extremes of free speech should be limited to ensure that they do not become hate speech. 'However, students do not have the right to impose their religious sensibilities on others and they must accept that they may be offended by those who do not share their convictions. 'Whilst this action by the RAHS may have been provocative, they should have every right to do it. 'Instead of closing down debate, . Reading University Student Union (RUSU) should be encouraging students . to interact with one another rather than pandering to the hurt feelings . of the devout.' Issued ultimatum: Student Union staff claimed a number of people had been left 'upset and distressed' by the pineapple . In a statement given to Student Rights, RUSU said: 'The RAHS were asked to leave the Freshers’ Fayre after receiving complaints from individual students about a display they had on their stall. 'They were initially asked to remove the display and after refusal were asked to leave. Our Freshers' Fayre is an inclusive event for all students. 'As the society's actions were causing upset and distress to a number of individual students and other societies attending we took the decision to ask them to leave.' Yesterday's incident comes after a row erupted at a top London University when an atheist society posted a cartoon sketch featuring the prophet Muhammed having a drink with Jesus on its Facebook page. The president of the Atheist, Secularist and Humanist society at the prestigious University College London (UCL), Robbie Yellon, stepped down over the controversy earlier this year. Last year, it was reported Muslim students, including trainee doctors on one of the university's medical courses began walking out of lectures on evolution claiming it conflicts with creationist ideas established in the Koran. The portrayal of the prophet in a U.S.-made anti-Islam video have also sparked violent demonstrations around the world in recent weeks.","Reading union staff claimed fruit caused 'distress and upset' to other students .

"Huge differences in the face-to-face teaching time students receive at Britain's top universities have been exposed by new official figures. Some undergraduates – paying tuition fees of £9,000 a year – get fewer than half the hours of lectures, seminars and tutorials than others studying the same subject at another university. Critics say the disparities mean many are getting a 'very raw deal' and accuse some universities of  failing to offer value for money. Some undergraduates get fewer than half the hours of lectures, seminars and tutorials than others studying the same subject at another university . The new figures, compiled from statistics on Government website Unistats, show that one of the widest gaps involves undergraduates studying history at York University, who spend just eight per cent of their course in lectures and seminars, with the rest in 'independent' study. This is fewer than 100 hours a year 'contact' time with academics and works out at a cost of nearly £100 an hour. But if they are reading the same subject at University College London, they will receive more than  triple the face-to-face teaching hours, at a rate of about £28 an hour. In other examples, politics students at Leeds University and theology students at Sheffield spend ten per cent of their time in face-to-face teaching – about 120 hours of  lectures and tutorials a year – while their counterparts at Liverpool and Manchester enjoy double that. At some newer universities, where the ability of the intake is more mixed and teaching takes priority over research, contact time tends to be greater. Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: 'Some students are getting a very raw deal. The temptation of these universities . is to free-up staff to concentrate on their own research, which tends to . be more lucrative than teaching.' Anthony . Seldon, the master of leading independent school Wellington College, . Berkshire, said: 'The majority of students have a tremendous time at . university and are appreciative of that. 'But increasingly we hear of . disappointment in the low level of demand placed on them and the lack of . quality time with academics and personal attention.' One . history student in his second year at York said: 'We all left school at . the same level but friends at Oxbridge and other universities are . working much more intensively than us – but we pay the same fees.' The . lack of face-to-face teaching on some courses has been one of the . biggest causes of complaints by  students. 'However, official figures . have become available only in recent months on the website after . Ministers insisted families had the right to make comparisons before . choosing a course. York . University's history department said it offered one-to-one  drop-in . sessions and dissertation supervision with academics that was not . reflected in the statistics.

"Medics have killed a woman by lethal injection because she could not cope with becoming blind. In one of the first cases of euthanasia for a disability, the 70-year-old was deemed by doctors to be ‘suffering unbearably’. They granted her wish to die after she had previously tried to commit suicide several times. But pro-life campaigners said the case showed how euthanasia and assisted suicide for more trivial reasons can soon become the ‘norm’ in countries where it is legal. Unbearable: The unnamed 70-year-old woman was deemed by two doctors to be 'suffering unbearably' as a result of her blindness and her wish to die was granted (stock image) They insisted it was medical negligence for the doctors in Holland to have gone along with the woman’s suicidal ideas and said they should have found a way to manage her psychological problems. The unnamed woman had been born with poor eyesight which had deteriorated into blindness as she entered old age. She had lived alone since her husband died. Health specialist Lia Bruin told a Dutch newspaper that the case was ‘exceptional’. ‘She was, for example, obsessed by cleanliness and could not stand being unable to see spots on her clothes,’ Bruin said. In neighbouring Belgium, deaf twins Marc and Eddy Verbessem, 45, were granted their wish to be killed last December after they learned they were likely to become blind. Anthony Ozimic of anti-euthanasia lobbyists SPUC Pro-Life, said the cases illustrated the dangers that would threaten vulnerable people in Britain if Lord Falconer’s assisted suicide bill became law. A lethal injection kit: In Holland, the patient must also be able to make a conscious and autonomous decision about ending their lives by lethal injection .

The patient must also be able to make a conscious and autonomous decision about ending their lives by lethal injection. The woman’s death comes just weeks . after it emerged that deaths by euthanasia have hit a record high in . Holland, with nearly one in seven people now dying at the hands of their . doctors. Euthanasia cases . soared by 13 per cent in 2012 - 4,188 deaths compared to 3,695 deaths – . meaning that it accounts for about one in 30 of all deaths, boosted . possibly by mobile death units launched last year to kill sick and elderly . people in their own homes when a family doctor objects on ‘ethical’ grounds.

The overall figure may even by higher if an accepted phenomenon of underreporting is also taken into consideration. Dr Peter Saunders of the Christian Medical Fellowship said: ‘Euthanasia in the Netherlands is way out of control. ‘The House of Lords calculated in 2005 that with a Dutch-type law in Britain we would be seeing over 13,000 cases of euthanasia per year. 'On the basis of how Dutch euthanasia deaths have risen since this may prove to be a gross underestimate.’ Most euthanasia cases in Holland involve cancer patients but increasingly they have included dementia sufferers and psychiatric patients.

Scarred: Nathan, 44, died last week after finding life unbearable since his sex change operation. The scars from his surgeries on his chest and forearm are visible in this photograph . In 2005, the Groningen Protocol protected doctors from being prosecuted for the euthanasia of infants as long as they followed approved guidelines. Euthanasia is carried out by administering a strong sedative to put the patient in a coma, followed by a drug to stop breathing and cause death. Last year, Belgium, where euthanasia came into force in 2003, saw a 25 per cent increase in such deaths, leaping to 1,432 – a figure representing about 2 per cent of all deaths in the country. Last month Belgian Nancy Verhelst, 44, was killed by euthanasia after doctors botched her sex change operation, leaving her with physical deformities she felt made her look like a ‘monster’. This week the Belgian parliament will discuss proposals to extend euthanasia to children, dementia sufferers and people with long-term illnesses. Assisted suicide – where a doctor will help a patient kill themselves – is also on the rise in countries where it is allowed. Marc and Eddy Verbessem, 45, had lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with the outside world . In Washington State in America, assisted suicides increased by 17 per cent in 2012 to 83 cases. Switzerland, which first relaxed prohibitions on assisted suicide in 1942, has seen a steady rise of assisted suicides of Swiss nationals from 43 in 1998 to 297 in 2009. The figures do not include people from abroad who travel to Dignitas to commit suicide there.","The woman was said to be 'suffering unbearably' because of blindness .

"Posing naked during or after pregnancy is often the last thing that some women feel like doing, but for others it can be both empowering and emotional. Now a new book reveals the truth about women's bodies after they have had children, complete with stunning photos and wise words from the mothers featured, all of whom explain how they learned to love their changing physique. And it certainly doesn't pull any punches. Stretchmarks, saggy tummies and loose skin all feature in A Beautiful Body Project: The Bodies of Mothers by US photographer Jade Beall. Scroll down for video . New book The Bodies of Mothers contains moving pictures of women after they have given birth . According to experts, birth has a huge impact on a woman's body and many feel their bodies are no longer the same afterwards. But many of the women in Beall's fascinating book say that having their photograph taken helped them to reconnect with their bodies and overcome any negative thoughts about their perceived imperfections. Accompanying the photographs of 80 women . who volunteered to be photographed nude or semi-nude are their stories of how giving . birth changed them. Some said that they initially found their new bodies with their stretch marks and loose skin 'repulsive' but after time, came to appreciate their strength and beauty. One of Beall's subjects Kasthuri. Her first child was born via a C-section after complications during birth . Photographer Jade Beall says she specialises in truthful images of women to counteract the culture of airbrushing . Beall, who lives in Arizona, says she suffered from poor self-image all of her . life, but that it was only after she become pregnant that she began to love her body. After giving birth she once again fell into a trough of self-loathing and became obsessed with losing weight. But when she posted a nude self-portrait online that showed her breast-feeding her baby son it went viral and was shared around the world. Thanks to the huge media interest in her . project, Beall then decided to create a series of photos showing 'real' and inspiring . women of all different ages, shapes and sizes, saying that she hoped to . inspire future generations of woman to embrace their beauty just as they . are. Rachel had her first child at the age of 30 and describes the 'pure bliss' after the pain of giving birth . A splash of colour from Kendra, 36, with her baby daughter . But Beall didn't have the money to carry the project out on her own, and considered dropping the whole thing to concentrate on her professional work. However . her husband Alok Appadurai suggested that she tried to raise funds . through Kickstarter. After uploading a video created on their home . computer, she was astonished to find that people pledged $60,000- three . times what she had asked for - and she had got a further $20,000 in . pre-orders for the book. Media interest in her project took off in early 2013 with coverage from news organisations from all around the world. Now her book. which was edited, proofed and produced by neighbours and volunteers, will be published May 11. In the . preface, Beall writes: 'We joyously present you with this . revolutionary concept and global bodypositive and self-love movement: . that one need not be photoshopped to be beautiful.

"The Council of Europe has ruled that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be banned in every country across the Continent. In a declaration that will have huge implications on human rights laws in its  47 member countries, the Strasbourg-based organisation announced that such practices 'must always be prohibited'. The move will represent a major setback to assisted dying campaigners in the UK who want Britain to follow Holland, Belgium and Switzerland in allowing doctors to help to end the lives of their patients. Ethical issue: Euthanasia and assisted suicide could now be banned in 47 member countries across the continent (file picture) The explicit condemnation of euthanasia was inserted into a non-binding  resolution entitled 'Protecting Human Rights and Dignity by Taking Into Account Previously Expressed Wishes of Patients'. The resolution had originally simply focused on the human rights questions of  'advance directives', or 'living wills', in which people set out how they wish to be treated if they became mentally incapacitated. But members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe argued that living wills, which became legal in the UK under the 2005 Mental Capacity Act, were inextricably connected to euthanasia. They successfully moved an amendment forbidding euthanasia by 34 votes to 16 with six abstentions. The amendment said that 'euthanasia, in the sense of the intentional killing by act or omission of a dependent human being for his or her alleged benefit must always be prohibited'. Among those fighting for the amendment was British member Edward Leigh, the Tory MP for Gainsborough. Thwarted: The move is a major setback for campaigners who had hoped Britain could follow Holland and Switzerland in allowing doctors to help patients end their lives (file picture) He referred to the case of Kerrie Wooltorton, a 26-year-old from Norwich who died in 2009 by poisoning after her living will prevented doctors from  resuscitating her. He said: 'Can my fellow delegates here in Strasbourg imagine how they would feel if they received a phone call informing them that one of their children had drunk poison and that ambulance and hospital staff who had everything necessary to save the child’s life stood by not helping instead as the child lay dying? 'That is a situation that advanced directives or living wills allow,' Mr Leigh  said. 'This is not alarmist talk - this is the historic fact, the track record.' But Paul Flynn, the Labour MP for Newport West, fought the amendment, saying it  changed the 'entire nature' of the report. 'Eighty-five per cent of the people of Britain are demanding reforms and  demanding change,' he said. 'We as legislators must also take into account the majority view of the  people,' Mr Flynn added. 'It is an important human right to have the right to die in a manner of our  choosing.' The Council of Europe was set up in 1949 to further European integration by harmonising human rights laws, although it is unable to pass laws itself. Its new resolution on euthanasia will, however, help to define the principles that should govern the application of living wills across its member states. It will be therefore hugely influential in helping governments to resist  pressure to weaken or abolish laws prohibiting assisted suicide and euthanasia. The Council bases its work on the European Convention on Human Rights. It includes the European Court of Human Rights, which enforces the convention and to which Europeans can bring cases if they believe that a member country has violated their rights.","Delegates claim 'living wills' for mentally incapacitated are inextricably linked to euthanasia .

"A businessman has turned down an offer of more than £6million for his 'F1' registration plate - enough cash to buy him 600 Ford Fiestas. Afzal Kahn has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds building up one of the country’s most impressive private plate collections. And the most desirable of the registrations is his beloved 'F1', which currently sits on the front of his Bugatti Veyron supercar. Big money: If he'd accepted the offer, he could have bought six more Bugatti Veyrons like this one . Cherished: Mr Kahn, who runs A Kahn Design in Bradford, rejected the offer believing it's worth much more . The entrepreneur caused a stir when, in 2008, he paid a staggering £440,000 for the cherished plate - a British record. But . it’s proven to be a savvy investment with the plate’s value increasing . by more than ten times after one ultra-rich individual offered £6million . for it. The highest price paid for a plate sold by the DVLA in the UK was £352,000 for plate 1 D. The highest ever price paid for a number plate sold by a dealer was Mr Khan's at £440,625, for F1 in 2008. Drivers in the United Arab Emirates are even more fanatical about personal registrations. The single digit ‘1’ sold in February 2008, for £7.25 million. Celebrities with famous plates include Vinnie Jones (100 VJ), Phil Tufnell (BE57 CAT), runner Iwan Thomas (R400 RUN), Ian Botham (B33 FYS) and Lord Sugar (AMS 1). Personal plates can be a good investment, if you make the right choice. VIP 1, which originally belonged to Pope John Paul II’s Popemobile, was bought for £62,000 in 2004 – two years later Roman Abramovich bought it for £285,000. HEN 2Y cost £6,300 in 2005, and was bought for £20,000 in 2010. The staggering sum of money could have bought six more Bugatti Veyrons, 75 Range Rovers or 600 Ford Fiestas. However, Mr Kahn, who runs A Kahn Design in Bradford, rejected the offer believing it is worth considerably more. Indeed, . he has no pressing need for new cars, with our pictures also showing . him posing with the plate attached to his Mercedes SLR McLaren, which go . for between £200,00 and £300,000 second hand. Mr . Khan's refusal to sell the plate means that he still likely holds the . record for spending the most money on a UK registration plate. Personalised . numberplate specialists regtransfers.co.uk marketed another . numberplate, reading 'X1', for a staggering £1million last September, . but there has been no information on what it finally sold for. Even . Roman Abramovich, Russian oligarch owner of Chelsea football club, was . only prepared to spend just £285,000 of his estimated £11billion fortune . on the 'VIP 1' number plate. A spokesman for Mr Khan's company said: 'We have received a significant multi-million pound offer for the F1 plate which we rejected out of hand. 'Mr Kahn has no interest in selling F1, which is his favourite plate. 'Cherished number plates, unlike property or other investments tend not to fluctuate in value, they only go up. 'It really shouldn’t be a shock to people that the number plate is worth millions of pounds.' Wealth: Mr Khan poses with the plate on his Mercedes SLR McLaren: It is perfectly legal to swap registration plates on cars that you own . Holding out: A spokesman for Mr Khan's company said that he believes that the plate is worth more . The 109-year-old registration was on a modest Volvo S80 when Kahn bought the plate in 2008. It was used by the chairman of Essex County Council with the local authority using the funds from the sale to raise money for a charity which aimed to raise the standards for young drivers. 'F1' now makes up part of Mr Kahn’s impressive plate collection which includes the registrations ‘4HRH’ and ‘NO1’. In 2008, Abu Dhabi businessman Saeed Khouri, then 25, is understood to have paid £7.1million on the United Arab Emirates registration plate '1'.

"Religious police in Saudi Arabia has banned a beauty pageant in the holy city of Mecca, claiming it violates Sharia law. The female organisers of the four-day pageant, called Miss Makkah, are now under investigation after the local vice police received several complaints.

The Commission for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue, known as Haia, banned the pageant and have reported the women to the local governate, The Saudi Gazette reports. Locals praised the actions of the Haia on the newspaper’s website, .

Welcome action: Commentators praised the local vice police for shutting down the pageant, calling it an 'un-Islamic contest' and calling for the 'maximum punishment' for the women organisers (stock image) Dr Noorul Hasan agreed, saying: ’ What a shocking news is it for all Muslims that a beauty pageant was to be held in our Prophet s city-Makkah. Such un-Islamic contests should never be held there. Those who investigated the matter and banned the contest are praiseworthy.’ Only one commentator defended Miss Makkah and its organisers: ’ What is the problem? There is no evidence that men would even be present. The article states the event was organized by and for women. 'If women wish to compete among themselves to look pretty or show off their talents and style to eachother, why is this anyone s business? Is it unislamic to look pretty now! How sad.’ Saudi Arabia follows an ultraconservative interpretation of Islam and bans women from a number of day-to-day activities, including driving a car, trying on clothes when shopping and entering a cemetery. Women are also banned from going out in public without a male chaperone, and although King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz passed a law in 2011 that would allow women to vote, it would not come into force until 2015.","Miss Makkah beauty pageant banned by vice police in Mecca, Saudi Arabia .

"Compromise: David Cameron told MPs the deal has protected the principle of a free Press from statutory regulation . David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg yesterday unveiled a cross-party agreement on Press regulation after ‘shambolic’ all-night talks – only to see the deal immediately opposed by senior Tories and challenged by key elements of the newspaper industry. All three party leaders tried to claim victory after 20 months of wrangling in the wake of the phone hacking scandal ended in an agreement by the Prime Minister to set up a media watchdog. It would have the power to require front-page apologies and issue £1million fines, under a Royal Charter. The campaign group Hacked Off, which represents celebrities and other victims of Press intrusion and had four representatives at cross-party talks, warmly welcomed the deal. By contrast, there was no-one present at the early hours negotiations from the newspaper industry – which was not informed the talks were taking place. And last night there were doubts over whether major newspaper publishers would agree to recognise the new watchdog, while some Tory MPs warned it constituted a serious threat to three centuries of Press freedom. Four newspaper groups, the Daily Mail Group, News International, Northern and Shell, publishers of the Express, and the Telegraph Media Group, as well as the Newspaper Society and the Professional Publishers Association, said they had not been consulted over the final package and there were ‘deeply contentious issues’ to consider. The Newspaper Society represents 1,100 regional papers. London Mayor Boris Johnson, a former journalist, telephoned Mr Cameron yesterday and expressed ‘serious concern’ about a proposal to hit publishers who refuse to sign up to the new watchdog with ‘exemplary’ damages in libel cases. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister, pictured leaving Number 10 ahead of his statement,  hailed the deal which would secure upfront apologies and million-pound fines . ‘The thing that is really exercising . Boris is the idea that if we don’t join the club then you get whacked . with massive fines,’ an ally said. ‘He made that clear to the Prime Minister. He has enormous concerns about it. He doesn’t see how, if proprietors and editors don’t sign up to it, you can start hitting them. That is something that concerns him greatly.’ Former Tory Cabinet minister Peter . Lilley went further, telling MPs the new regulator would act as an . Orwellian ‘Ministry of Truth’ and urging media organisations to follow . the example of The Spectator magazine, which has indicated it will . refuse to recognise the body. There was wider concern on the Tory benches at the chaotic nature of the discussions at which the deal was brokered. Actor Hugh Grant lead the Hacked Off campaign for tougher press regulation . Mr Cameron pulled the plug on . cross-party talks on Thursday, claiming Labour had produced fresh . demands, apparently prepared in close co-operation with Hacked Off. But over the weekend, facing a . Commons defeat as Labour and the Lib Dems threatened to join forces, the . Prime Minister reopened discussions with Mr Clegg. His chief . negotiator, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin, was then dispatched . to talks in Labour leader Ed Miliband’s office in the Commons on Sunday . night. Deal done: Culture Secretary Maria Miller claimed to have averted Labour's 'extreme version' of press law, but Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman claimed it was a deal which victims of phone hacking could be 'pleased' with . Four representatives of Hacked Off, . which has campaigned for a draconian crackdown on media excesses, were . present. A deal was finally reached at 2.30am yesterday. Downing Street denied that Mr Cameron . had been asleep, insisting he had been in touch with Mr Letwin . regularly throughout the night, with their last contact at 3.20am. Tory MPs expressed private amazement . that the Government had allowed talks to take place in Mr Miliband’s . office, or with Hacked Off present – but no-one from the media industry. Deal: Miliband, Clegg and Cameron launched a new round of late-night negotiations on the issue . In the Commons later the Prime . Minister said a Press law had been avoided – although he conceded there . were ‘two very important but relatively small legislative changes’ needed. They include a clause allowing more . punitive libel damages to be awarded against publishers who refuse to . recognise the watchdog.  A separate clause was passed last night to . ensure that the Royal Charter for the Press cannot be amended unless . two-thirds of MPs and peers and all three main party leaders agree. Mr Cameron made a number of . concessions to secure the deal, dropping an effective veto for the . industry over the regulator’s membership and agreeing that the regulator . should have the power to ‘direct’ newspapers on the prominence of . apologies and corrections. Recommendation: Lord Justice Leveson called for a new Press regulator underpinned by statute . A Labour MP yesterday demanded that the editor of the Sun be sacked after the newspaper paid damages for accessing a stolen mobile phone. Immigration spokesman Chris Bryant called for Dominic Mohan to quit after his reporters read messages from a mobile belonging to fellow Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh. The Sun accepted there had been ‘a serious misuse of Miss McDonagh’s private information’ after her phone was taken from her car in South-West London in October 2010. The Sun, which was not accused of stealing the phone, offered an unreserved apology and Miss McDonagh said she was paid £50,000 damages by News Corp. After the hearing, Miss McDonagh said that she felt very uneasy after being told in 2012 that the paper had appeared to have ‘acquired her mobile phone’. The regulator was also given the . power to appoint the committee which writes the Editor’s Code, . dismantling the one part of the existing system that is agreed to work . well. Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘This system . will ensure upfront apologies, million-pound fines, a self-regulatory . body with independence of appointments and funding, a robust standards . code, an arbitration service that is free for victims and a speedy . complaint handling mechanism. We can put all of this in place without . the need for statutory regulation.’ Broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby, . chairman of the Index on Censorship, warned: ‘The two-thirds block on . any changes to the Royal Charter could be abused in the future – not . least when today’s emerging consensus shows that the parties can come . together in both Houses to agree on press regulation.’ Mr Lilley said: ‘We are giving a body . the right to decide what is fact and what is true. At worse, it is . going to be establishing a sort of mini self-appointed Ministry of . Truth. ‘We note that no similar powers are taken with respect to the BBC.’ Mr Lilley added: ‘I hope personally . that when this is established quite a lot of media organisations will . have the courage to follow the Spectator and stand aside from this body . and remain free while hopefully adopting the highest standards in the . way they publish and treat the public.’ Conservative MP for Clacton Douglas Carswell said: ‘Today is a milestone. Press now answer to quangocrats. Awful, awful, awful. The MPs have produced a Press regulatory regime of fiendish complexity, with layer upon layer of bureaucracy. The process begins with the political parties themselves who, by devising the terms of yesterday’s Royal Charter, have interfered in the workings of the free Press for the first time in 300 years. As we show in the flowchart, the first step to be taken under the Charter they have produced will be the establishment of a Recognition Appointments Panel (shaded red, on the bottom right-hand side). Handpicked by ex-Whitehall mandarin   Sir David Normington, the current Commissioner for Public Appointments, none of  the four members can ever have been a newspaper editor. In turn, as the arrow on the diagram shows, this panel will then appoint a Recognition Panel. This will contain up to eight members, none of whom, the politicians have decided, can be an editor, publisher or a member of the Commons or Lords. Crucially, it will have sweeping powers to oversee the new independent Press regulator. The Recognition Panel will carry out regular checks on the regulator and will pass judgment on whether or not it is working. A negative verdict could take Westminster back to the drawing board. This brings us to the regulator itself – which, as we show in the boxes coloured blue, is being established under a separate, hugely complicated process. The first move in setting this up will be the establishment of a six-strong Foundation Group (bottom left) appointed by the newspaper industry and headed by ex-President of the Supreme Court Lord Phillips. The group’s job is solely to set up a Regulatory Appointments Panel, which will contain five members – an independent chairman, two other independent members, an editor and one other industry member. This Panel’s job is two-fold. First, it must pick the 12 members of the Main Board (coloured purple) of the new Press regulator, which will be independently chaired with six other independent members. The five industry members on the Board – a minority – cannot include serving editors. The Panel will also establish the Complaints Committee, an off-shoot of the regulator containing the Main Board’s chairman, six independent members and five industry figures, none of whom can be a serving editor. The Complaints Committee will decide if the new Code on journalistic conduct  and ethics has been breached in individual cases – which could lead to the Main Board ordering the publication of prominent apologies and corrections. Drawing up this new Code will require the establishment of yet another panel – the Code Committee – featuring five independent members, five journalists and five editors.  It will be appointed by the Main Board, raising concerns that it will be acting as judge and jury on rules it has itself written. To this galaxy of committees will then be added two other new bodies, which are offshoots of the new regulator’s main board. The first, the Standards and Compliance Arm, will have the power to investigate potentially systemic problems at a newspaper, such as phone hacking, and impose huge fines. Meanwhile, the Arbitral Arm will set up a panel to adjudicate on civil complaints against newspapers, without the need to go to court. If a member of the public wins a case, the newspaper involved must pick up their costs. But, if the person loses, newspapers will not be able to recover their own legal fees – potentially leaving regional newspapers, in particular, with crippling bills. There are also concerns about the system being swamped by compensation-seekers. To get this Byzantine system of regulation off the ground will require countless meetings involving dozens of panel members and independent experts. The danger is that it will collapse under its own complexity.","Press watchdog will issue £1m fines and demand front page apologies .

"Hundreds of passengers were left stranded in Britain today after airline Qantas grounded its flights across the globe because of a bitter industrial dispute. The Australian national carrier decided to halt its fleet of 108 aircraft indefinitely until unions representing pilots and ground staff reach an agreement with the airline over pay and conditions. Among the 70,000 passengers affected by the 600 cancelled flights are 17 Commonwealth leaders stranded in Perth following the summit there. However, neither David Cameron's nor the Queen's flights home have been affected, MailOnline was told. Worldwide disruption: Passengers at airports around the world were left waiting for alternative flights as Qantas grounded its entire fleet . Passengers at Terminal 3 in Heathrow check their phones as they take in the news that their Qantas flights have been cancelled . Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she had 'taken a rare decision' to call an emergency arbitration court hearing on Saturday night to end the strike . Australia’s Prime Minister Julia . Gillard, who hosted the summit which saw the Queen and David . Cameron attend, issued a dire warning over the strike's impact saying it could hurt the country’s . economy. She said: 'The Qantas dispute . escalated today and I am concerned about that for the national economy . ... it could have implications for our national economy.' The Prime Minister said her centre-left government, which is affiliated with the trade union movement, had 'taken a rare decision' to call an emergency arbitration court hearing on Saturday night to terminate the strike action. 'I believe it is warranted in the circumstances we now face with Qantas ... circumstances with this industrial dispute that could have implications for our national economy,' she added. Transport Minister Anthony Albanese described the grounding as 'disappointing' and 'extraordinary'. He was reported to be furious that Qantas had only given him three hours' notice of their plan of action. A Heathrow spokesman said four Qantas planes were due to take off from the airport today - meaning . hundreds of passengers who were scheduled to depart are now unable to . fly. British passengers abroad who are due to use the carrier will also face travel disruption. The Foreign Office issued a statement . advising those due to travel with the airline in the next 48 hours to . check on the Qantas website or to consult their tour operator. International chaos: Passengers queuing at Qantas check-in counters at Changi International Airport in Singapore as the airline grounded its flights . Disruption: 600 flights were cancelled worldwide, affecting 70,000 passengers around the globe - Qantas flights shown on the display board in Singapore . The . decision by Qantas comes on the same day Air France announced it has . cancelled about 20 per cent of its flights due to a strike by flight . attendants. The . action is affecting mostly short- and medium-haul flights out of French . airports, but 10 long-haul flights were also cancelled today. The . airline said the situation at Paris's main airport, Charles de Gaulle, . was largely normal, with most passengers on cancelled flights rebooked . on other airlines. At the capital's Orly airport, however, about 200 passengers were waiting to be rebooked. The . strike, in protest against cuts to cabin crews, comes during an . extended school holiday and at the start of a long weekend in France. Tuesday is a public holiday and many people go away for the four-day . weekend. The carrier plans to 'lock out' all . employees involved with industrial action from Monday evening. Staff . will not be required to turn up at work and will not be paid. The airline had been forced to reduce . and reschedule flights for weeks because of a series of strikes over . staff concerns that their jobs are being moved overseas. A Qantas spokesman said 600 flights have been cancelled because of the industrial action - affecting 70,000 passengers. Flights in the air continued to their destinations, but others were stopped even taxiing on the runway, according to one flier, and all others were cancelled. British tourist Chris Crulley, 25, said the pilot on his Qantas flight informed passengers while taxiing down a Sydney runway that he had to return to the terminal 'to take an important phone call'. The flight was then grounded. 'We're all set for the flight and settled in and the next thing - I'm stunned. We're getting back off the plane,' the firefighter told reporters from Sydney Airport by phone. Crulley was happy to be heading home to Newcastle after a five-week vacation when his flight was interrupted. 'I've got to get back to the other side of the world by Wednesday for work. It's a nightmare,' he added. Qantas offered him up to $350 Australian dollars a day for food and accommodation, but Crulley expected to struggle to find a hotel at short notice in Sydney on a Saturday night. Waiting for information: Passengers at Hong Kong International Airport wait to hear more information as their Qantas flights are cancelled . The strikes have cost the airline 15 million Australian dollars (£10 million) a week. The airline said customers booked on . Qantas flights should not go to the airport until further notice and a . full refund would be available for those affected. A spokesman said: ""Qantas regrets that this action has become necessary and apologises sincerely to all affected passengers."" A spokeswoman for British Airways, . which has a joint services agreement with the airline, said: ""British . Airways-operated flights between the UK and Australia are not expected . to be disrupted at this time. ""Customers who are booked to travel . on a British Airways service operated by Qantas are urged to check the . status of their flight. ""If your travel commences within the next 24 hours please contact our call centres to discuss alternatives."" Flights in the air were continuing to their destinations and booked . passengers were being rescheduled at Qantas's expense, chief executive . Alan Joyce said. Grounded to a halt: The airline said customers booked on Qantas flights should not go to the airport until further notice and a full refund would be available for those affected . Trying to depart: Passengers in Singapore wait at the departure area hoping to change flights after Qantas grounds their fleet worldwide . Bookings had already collapsed after unions warned travellers to . travel with other airlines over the busy Christmas-New Year period, and . Mr Joyce told a news conference in Sydney that the unions' actions have . caused a crisis for Qantas. 'They are trashing our strategy and our brand,' he said. 'They are . deliberately destabilising the company and there is no end in sight.' Transport Minister Anthony Albanese said the government would apply . to an arbitration court to rule on the strike action and the airline's . response. 'The government is extremely concerned about the future of Qantas, . its workforce but also the travelling public,' he told reporters. All 108 aircraft in as many as 22 countries will be grounded until . unions representing pilots, mechanics, baggage handlers and caterers . reach agreements with Qantas over pay and conditions, Mr Joyce said. 'We are locking out until the unions withdraw their extreme claim and . reach agreement with us,' he went on, referring to shutting staff out . of their work stations. 'This is a crisis for Qantas. If the action continues as the unions . have promised, we will have no choice but to close down Qantas part by . part.' Staff will not be required to show up at work and will not be paid from Monday, Mr Joyce added. He estimated the grounding will cost the airline 20 million dollars . (£13 million) a day. It has already had been forced to reduce and . reschedule flights for weeks because of a series of strikes and overtime . work bans over staff concerns that their jobs are being moved overseas. Steve Purvinas, federal secretary of the mechanics' union, the . Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association, described the . grounding as 'an extreme measure'. The recent strike action has most severely affected Qantas domestic flights. In mid-October, Qantas grounded five jets and reduced domestic . flights by almost 100 a week because aircraft mechanics had cut the . hours they were prepared to work. Qantas infuriated unions in August when it said it would improve its . loss-making overseas business by creating an Asia-based airline with its . own name and brand. The five-year restructuring plan will cost 1,000 of Qantas's 35,000 jobs. Passengers affected by the disruption have been advised to contact their local Qantas Contact Centre, available on their website (www.qantas.com).

"Germany faces a wave of crime and disorder because of large-scale immigration from Romania and Bulgaria, according to a leaked government document. In what could serve as a warning to Britain, the report describes overcrowded slum conditions, public health threats and disruption on the streets as a result of the influx from the two countries. The German statistics office estimates that 437,000 Romanians and Bulgarians have travelled to the country over the past three years alone, with numbers rising to 176,000 last year. A leaked report in Germany has warned that mass immigration threatens 'social peace'. Pictured: An estate in Duisburg where up to 400 Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants live in squalor . The leaked report from Germany’s . interior ministry – the equivalent of the UK’s Home Office – says that . migration from Romania and Bulgaria poses a risk to ‘social peace’ in . major cities. It says schools are under pressure . because of the arrival of high numbers of non-German speaking pupils who . hold back progress for local children. It follows a series of alarms from . German local government organisations which have detailed the spread of . prostitution and robbery, organised gangs of child criminals and poor . living conditions that have come with immigrants. Report said chaos was caused in schools where Romanian and Bulgarian children 'speak no German' A young girl drops litter on the estate in Duisberg where hundreds of immigrants have moved . The new assessment from Berlin comes as Britain prepares to open its labour market to Romanian and Bulgarian citizens. Limits imposed on the rights of . people from the two countries to take jobs in Britain are lifted at the . end of the year, seven years after they joined the EU. But the respected think tank . Migration Watch believes the opening of the jobs market may add 50,000 a . year to British immigration. German labour laws allows Romanian . and Bulgarian citizens to remain in the country longer than three months . if they have a trade and a job, and the welfare system allows families . to claim child benefits – which in some cases can bring in up to £500 a . week. But wider limitations on the right to work are still in force . until January, as in Britain and the rest of the EU. Surveys in Romania and Bulgaria have . suggested that many people already want to leave – even ahead of the . easing of EU restrictions – and Germany is the nearest major country . they can go to.It can, therefore, supply a model of what other nations such as Britain and France may expect from January. The interior ministry document says . that crime – particularly prostitution – is on the increase in the areas . where the newcomers have settled. The report describes ‘extreme . occupancy of dilapidated, uninhabitable properties with illegal . dormitories’, adding that overcrowding could mean 20 people sleeping in . one room. It speaks of ‘dirty patios, overfilled rubbish bins’ and . ‘noisy crowds into the small hours’. It names the cities that have been . worst affected by the impact of immigration, among them Frankfurt, . Offenbach, Mannheim, Munich, Hanover, Berlin, Dortmund and Duisburg. The newspaper that acquired the . leaked report, Bild, said: ‘The document explicitly warns of the . consequences for the social peace.’ Earlier this year, local leaders in . Duisburg demanded help to meet growing problems brought by Romanian and . Bulgarian immigration. They said the city had seen an . increase in prostitution and robberies and high piles of rubbish strewn . over its streets since the migrants began to arrive last year. Soeren Link, its left-wing mayor, . said it was costing almost £15million a year to house, feed and police . the new arrivals. ‘We are massively affected,’ said Mr Link. ‘It is . costing us millions and will cost us more by next year.’ He said anyone who thought the . problem was going to go away was ‘misty-eyed’, adding: ‘We didn’t ask . for this problem and we can’t handle it alone.’ In February a report by the German . Association of Cities said taxpayers now face ‘significant costs as a . result of this poverty migration’.","Report warns of possible civil disturbance unless immigration is checked .

"Chris Joannides has been expelled from the Conservative Party for 12 months and is no longer endorsed as a candidate for May's local elections . A Conservative councillor has been . kicked out of the party after a picture comparing burkas to binbags was . posted on his Facebook page. Chris . Joannides has been expelled for a year following an investigation over . the image which showed a woman and child in traditional Muslim dress . standing between two black rubbish sacks. A . caption underneath the photograph said: ‘I saw her standing there and I . told her she had three beautiful children. She didn’t have to get all . p***ed off and threaten me. It was an honest mistake!’ The . councillor, who did not compose the words on the caption, said it was . posted on his page by a friend but he admitted having ‘shared’ it in . what he described as ‘blokeish banter’. He said he then deleted it from . his page. Mr Joannides was . initially suspended by the Enfield Conservative Group in North London . last year when complaints emerged over the picture. Both the police and his local party investigated the matter but decided to take no action. But Conservative Central Office took a harsher view of his social networking behaviour. A . spokesman said: ‘Chris Joannides is not endorsed as a candidate in the . forthcoming local government elections. No appeal is permitted under . party rules. Furthermore, Mr Joannides is expelled from the party for a . period of 12 months. ‘He may appeal against this decision and it is our understanding he intends to do so.’ Mr Joannides, who is of Greek-Cypriot origin and represents the Grange Ward in Enfield, has courted controversy before. He . upset colleagues by complaining that his community work often . interferes with his social life. On occasions he was known to message . Facebook friends during meetings with his constituents, ask for updates . on football scores and complain that his work meant he was missing his . favourite TV programmes. During . last year’s investigation into the local politician some 27 images of . his Facebook page revealed his frustration at a particular ward meeting . on which he stated: ‘I’ll be surfing Facebook during the residents’ meeting.’ This image was shared on the Facebook profile of Mr Joannides . Since the row . erupted Mr Joannides has repeatedly maintained he is not ‘Islamophobic’. He said: ‘The picture was shared on my Facebook profile by a friend and . I deleted it straight away, but someone took a photo of it before I . could take it down. ‘I was . investigated by the local association and cleared. I was investigated by . the police and cleared. I was reselected to stand in May by the local . branch. ‘Then I got an email . from Conservative Central Office at the 11th hour telling me they were . suspending my membership for 12 months, effectively barring me from . standing. ‘The rug has been pulled away from me. I am not and never have been Islamophobic.’ In . a statement to his local newspaper he hit out at Conservative Central . Office, saying: ‘They have punished me disproportionately.’ When . the row first blew up he admitted he may have offended some Muslims in . Enfield but said that the image had been around on the internet for two . years. He told a London radio station that the original decision to suspend him was ‘political correctness gone slightly wrong’. Michael Lavender, leader of the Enfield Conservative group, said he supported the intervention  by the Conservatives nationally.","Chris Joannides, councillor for Enfield, expelled from party for 12 months .

"Jailed: Matthew Woods, 19, from Chorley, Lancashire, made a number of derogatory posts about April and missing Madeline McCann . A teenager has been jailed for 12 weeks after admitting making grossly offensive comments on his Facebook page about missing youngster April Jones. Matthew Woods, 19, from Chorley, Lancashire, made a number of derogatory posts about April and missing Madeline McCann after getting the idea from a website that 'trades in sick jokes'. Today he was sent to prison for three months amid a chorus of cheers and clapping across the courtroom. The public gallery erupted while Woods choked back tears as JP Dr Bill . Hudson told him: 'This was a disgusting and despicable crime which the . bench find completely abhorrent. 'There . were words used and references made to the case in Wales and Madeline . McCann who went missing in Portugal some years ago were nothing less . than shocking. 'So much so no right thinking person in society should have communicated to them such distress. 'The . families of those children should not be subjected to any use of social . media like this. We should all be aware of the sensitivity of other . people and especially the family involved in such statements made on . Twitter, Facebook and such like. 'We felt there was no other sentence which would convey the abhorrence that many people have for this sort of crime.' April, five, disappeared a week ago today from near her home in Machynlleth, Wales. Mark Bridger, 46, is charged with her abduction and murder. Among Woods' comments were: 'I woke up this morning in the back of a transit van with two beautiful little girls, I found April in a hopeless place.' Jokes: Matthew Woods, 19, from Chorley, . Lancashire, made a number of derogatory posts about April, left, and missing . Madeleine McCann, right, who disappeared in 2007, after getting the idea from Sickipedia . Another read: 'Who in their right mind would abduct a ginger kid?' Others stated 'I love April Jones' and 'Could have just started the greatest Facebook argument ever. April Fools, Who Wants Maddie?' He also wrote comments of a sexually explicit nature about the five-year-old. Woods also made offensive references to Madeleine McCann who went missing aged four in Portugal in 2007. Chorley Magistrates’ Court heard members of the public were so upset about his postings that they reported them to the police. A 'vigilante mob' of around 50 people later descended upon his home address and the defendant was arrested on Saturday night at a separate address for his own safety. Police officers outside Chorley Magistrates Court in Lancashire today where Woods was jailed for 12 weeks . Woods realised the strength of . animosity over his postings after his own mother posted a Facebook . message saying: 'You should stop and think things out before opening ya . gob.' He then left a message saying: 'Sorry to my friends and family that have been brought into all this. 'I’m . not a bad guy just took a joke to far I’ve apologised for what has been . said and there’s nothing more what I can do sop all this s*** really . aint going to sort anything nothing more to say on the matter apart from . sorry again.' Martina Jay, prosecuting, said: 'When interviewed by police he fully admitted he posted messages about the two missing children.

A police team carefully search land near Machynlleth, Mid Wales this afternoon for April Jones . Officers walk in slowly in a line across the rugged landscape looking for clues which could lead them to April . He conceded to police that his Facebook account - available to a large number of people - had not been hacked and that he was responsible for all the postings made on October 3 and 4. Unemployed Woods entered a guilty plea to sending by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive. Police at the home of Mark Bridger, 46, this afternoon who appeared in court today charged with April's abduction and murder . After meeting his client for the first time, defending solicitor David Edwards told the bench: 'What struck me immediately is that the enormity of what he has done has finally sunk in. 'He did seem genuinely remorseful and regretful for what he had done. At the time he posted these comments not once did he think he would find himself where he is today.' He said Woods got the idea for the posting from Sickipedia 'which basically trades in sick jokes'. Mr Edwards added: 'He started receiving derogatory replies almost immediately and then came threats. 'The reality is that before long a number of people realised what he had done and sought him out.' The solicitor said Woods explained what had started as a joke had gone wrong. 'He . realises this will have a profound effect on him,' he continued. 'With . the publicity that has followed he will be known as the man who made . these comments on Facebook. He . has to live with this because of his stupidity. His future is . uncertain. He does not know whether he can go back to his home address. 'He . fully accepts he was the author of his own misfortune. Nothing like . this is going to happen again. He appreciates what he has done and puts . himself at the mercy of the court.' A photograph of missing April adorns a door as police continue their search to find the five year old girl . He asked for a community service order to be considered but the bench was told that custody could be imposed for anyone who is convicted of using extreme language that causes substantial distress or fear to another. The bench asked for a pre-sentence report from a probation officer and said it would keep all options open ahead of sentencing, which is set to take place from 2pm today. The jail term was imposed just . hours after the same magistrates fined a man £100 and ordered him to pay . £100 compensation after he racially insulting a black woman. The . woman had been driving her car in Chorley when she heard the defendant . directly shout at her: 'you black f****** c****'. When she stopped and . confronted him he screwed up a piece of paper and threw it at her face.","Matthew Woods made a number of sick posts after getting the idea from a website that 'trades in sick jokes'

The dolphin pack was captured on video by passengers on board a BC Ferries vessel traveling from Galiano Island to Tsawwassen.

This species of dolphin is known to travel in large pods of 50 to 200 and as big as 2,000 but Dr Barrett-Lennard called their appearance in the Strait as a 'rare and unique occurrence'. Packs that big would normally be seen in coastal waters. Mr Maguire said he spoke with BC Ferries workers who said they'd never seen 'anything like this before'.

'But afterwards everyone was abuzz, strangers were talking with strangers and getting to know one another.' Diane Williams was on the ferry and standing next to Mr Maguire when he took the video.

"Iain Duncan Smith has launched an incendiary attack on the BBC for ‘adopting the language of the Labour Party’ by branding a key welfare reform a ‘bedroom tax’. In a letter leaked to the Daily Mail, the Work and Pensions Secretary accuses the corporation of helping to alarm hundreds of thousands of people in social housing who will be unaffected. In the strongest attack on its coverage by a minister since the coalition came to power, he says there has been ‘persistent use’ of the term ‘bedroom tax’ by BBC correspondents and on the BBC’s news website, despite the phrase being ‘innately political and indeed factually wrong’. Iain Duncan Smith slated the BBC for using the 'innately political' and 'factually wrong' term . Under the Government’s housing benefit reforms, which come into effect in April, working-age claimants in social housing who have more bedrooms than they require will see their handouts reduced. Tenants affected will face a 14 per cent cut in housing benefit for the first excess bedroom, and 25 per cent where two or more bedrooms are unused. The Government, which estimates the average affected household affected will lose £14 a week, says the policy will save taxpayers £500 million a year from the massive housing benefit bill. It will also encourage people to move into smaller properties to relieve pressure on stock, helping families crammed into homes that are too small, ministers say. Mr Duncan Smith says the Government is simply cutting what he calls a ‘spare room subsidy’, but Labour has mounted a fierce campaign to oppose the move, branding it a ‘bedroom tax’. In a letter dated March 7, to Fran Unsworth, the acting head of BBC News, the Work and Pensions Secretary insists: ‘It is not a tax and it is wrong to describe it in this way. A tax, as the Oxford English Dictionary makes clear, is a “compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on worker’s income and business profits or added to the cost of some goods, services and transactions”.’ Fran Upsworth is acting head of BBC news and was sent the letter after Duncan Smith became enraged . He goes on: ‘What this policy does it reduce some social housing tenants’ benefit if their home has one or more spare bedrooms. This cannot in any way be described as a tax. The BBC gas a duty to inform the public. We believe that the BBC is failing in this duty and confusing members of the public on whether they might be “taxed”. ‘This is a public disservice. In using the word tax, the BBC has helped to worry those not in social housing that they might be taxed when this is not the policy. ‘It is also a term continually used and promoted by the Labour Party.’ Mr Duncan Smith says that the Government has complained about the unquestioning use of the term before and been led to believe that the BBC, which has a statutory duty to be politically unbiased, accepted it was political and should not be used. But correspondents continue to use it, sometimes with the addition of the words ‘critics call’ or ‘it’s been called’, he complains. The Work and Pensions Secretary said he accepts the BBC is right to report that the Labour Party is calling the policy a tax, but insists its correspondents should make clear that the term is factually incorrect and innately political. ‘We do not believe it is the job of the BBC to use misleading terms and promote the views of the Labour Party,’ he adds. ‘Rather than doing this, you might care to devote some time to explaining what the Government is trying to do – I’m sure your audience would value this.’ He points out that on BBC Breakfast, Moneybox presenter Paul Lewis talked about how the policy might impact disabled people and foster carers ‘without even mention there is millions in support’ for those groups. Foster carers and parents of serving armed forces personnel have since been exempted from welfare deductions. ‘Nor have we heard any of the facts given to you by the department about the thousands of families in overcrowded accommodation or on waiting lists for a home,’ Mr Duncan Smith adds. ‘This is not simple debate about the “branding” of a policy. It is about factual accuracy, ensuring the public are properly informed, and being clear about the political nature of terminology that has gained common currency at the BBC. ‘The public expects you to do better.’ A BBC spokesperson said: “We can confirm that we have received a letter from Iain Duncan Smith and we will respond directly in due course.” A YouGov poll showed that 49 per cent of the public support the government’s reforms, compared to 38 per cent against. Labour has opposed the welfare reform, but yesterday there was confusion as one shadow minister suggested it would support it when claimants refused to move to smaller properties. Shadow culture minister Helen Goodman said: ‘We have said that the bedroom tax should only apply if people have been offered a smaller place to live and turned it down, because obviously it’s better to use housing stock more efficiently.’ A Labour spokesman insisted: ‘We strongly oppose the bedroom tax and continue to do so.’","Duncan Smith accuses the BBC of helping to alarm thousands of people .

"Rosalyn, already a mother of six children, is waiting to give birth. But she will not enjoy the privacy of her own delivery room, her husband Eduardo by her side. Instead, Rosalyn will be one of the 300 new mothers crammed into the wards at the Dr Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, which sees, on average, 60 new babies come into the world every single day. Space at the maternity wing is at a premium, so Rosalyn and her new baby will share with other mothers, usually five to a bed but sometimes more, and she will give birth as part of a group of six when the time comes. Scroll down for video . Crammed: The wards at the Dr Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital are packed - with more than five women per bed . Dubbed the 'world's busiest maternity ward', the natal wing at the Dr Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital serves the nearby Tondo slum, a former rubbish dump now home to half a million people. Here, Rosalyn and her husband Eduardo eke out a living on his daily salary of 380 pesos (£6), augmented by Rosalyn's embroidery work which brings in around 280 pesos (£4) every few days. 'Even if you have no work, you still . have to pay the bills,' explains Eduardo. 'I have two jobs . for my family's sake. 'I'll do anything to earn more money for my . family, odd jobs - even if it's on a Sunday.' Back at the hospital, Rosalyn is having her final check up with one of the nurses at the Dr Jose Fabella. Watched by documentary film maker Anita . Rani, Rosalyn discusses the blood donors she will need to bring to the . birth with a brisk, efficient nurse. Queued up: Labouring women have to share the delivery suite with at least five other expectant mothers . Documentary: Film maker Anita Rani surrounded by some of the new mothers at the Manila hospital . The Philippines is chronically short of blood which makes bagged blood enormously expensive and out of reach for someone like Rosalyn. But with a seventh baby on the way, haemorrhage is a real risk so she's arranged for a friend to be at the hospital during the delivery along with Eduardo. 'It would be better to have three . donors,' chides the midwife. 'Because here in Fabella, three donors is the . equivalent of the amount of blood that would be used for you. 'We prepare . for your delivery because we don't know if you will bleed at the time . of your delivery. Remember it's your seventh pregnancy.' Seven children is not unusual in the Philippines. In Tondo, families of 10 or even 12 are common, and as a result, at peak times, midwives at the Dr Jose Fabella can deliver as many as 100 babies within a 24-hour period. 'Sometimes, during high season, 13  to 16 babies are in the delivery room at the same time,' Arlene Matanguihan, a resident doctor, said. 'It's chaotic but an organised chaos. We can still manage – no baby drops out on the floor.' Privacy: For mothers like Rosalyn, there's no room where they can spend time alone with their newborn . Experienced: Chief midwife Anna Prebus, left, has delivered an estimated 200,000 babies . Chief midwife Anna Prebus has delivered so many babies, she finds it impossible to remember how many she has brought into the world. 'I'm sorry but I can't remember [how . many babies I've delivered],' she tells Rani. 'It's so many! Maybe 200,000. I've been here . since 1986, almost 28 years.' One in five of central Manila's mothers come here to deliver their babies, and midwives work day and night. As a result, conditions in the hospital are grim, with queues of pregnant women waiting in the reception area and hundreds more squeezed into the tiled wards. Those on the verge of giving birth are packed into a tiny labour room. 'There are five in a bed, sometimes we have more,' notes Prebus, who points to women being wheeled into the delivery room, at the very last minute, in groups of six or more. But for Rosalyn, giving birth in front of five others is the least of her worries. Although the Dr Jose Fabella is a public hospital, operations have to be paid for. As a result, she and Eduardo live in fear of complications and a hugely expensive caesarian section. Uncomfortable: Post partum mothers are crammed into beds while their babies wait in a nearby nursery . Labour: A group of nurses and midwives cluster around a mother giving birth - there's no privacy at all . 'I'm worried because it's her . [Rosalyn's] due date,' explains Eduardo as he waits nervously by his wife's side. 'I am also concerned with the child, whether it's . going to be a normal delivery or by caesarian. 'If she doesn't have a . normal birth, we will be in financial trouble. The budget is our number . one problem.' 'I will force myself to give birth by normal delivery,' adds Rosalyn. 'I just want a . normal delivery. I cannot accept a caesarian section. 'I hope to have a . problem-free delivery. That's what I pray for - that we will be OK when I . give birth.' Luckily for Rosalyn, her birth is a smooth one. 'There's no screaming, there's no babies crying, . everyone is very controlled and composed,' comments a watching Rani. Newborns: Documentary maker Anita Rani with two of the babies born at the world's busiest maternity ward . Disgusting: Like many on the maternity ward, Rosalyn lives in Tondo - a teeming slum built on a rubbish dump . 'I don't know what that says . about Filipino women, something about their psyche... Just like that, . another baby is born.' When Rosalyn's baby boy finally makes his appearance, the new mother is relieved, if apprehensive about his future. 'If the child can finish his studies, I . hope he won't be like us where you need to work just to be able to eat,' she says. 'There should be a limit on the amount of children you have. That is why I am . teaching them not to follow in my footsteps and have lots of babies.' Wise words, but for Prebus and her busy team of midwives, the 24-hour round of births continues.

"Fined: Lawyer Danielle Morris, pictured,  said  'I cannot stand Jewish people' during an office rant . A female lawyer who blurted out: 'I cannot stand Jewish people' during an office rant has been left with a huge legal bill after a discrimination case was brought against her by a former colleague. Danielle Morris, 34, was subject of a three-and-a-half year investigation in front of two legal tribunals and almost lost her career after she made the remark during an office conversation. The mother-of-two complained a Jewish man had jumped the queue at a medical centre while she was waiting to take one of her children to see a doctor. Later she relayed the incident in the presence of a Jewish cashier at her law practice  in Rossendale, Lancashire. After making her comment, the unnamed cashier said: 'Please do not say that' but Mrs Morris added: 'I don’t care, I cannot stand them.' Three months after the incident in December 2009, the cashier left the law firm - then brought a racial and religious claim against Mrs Morris and the practice and won an undisclosed sum in damages. Mrs Morris herself was then hauled before the Solicitor’s Regulation Authority after a further complaint of discrimination by the cashier. It emerged the matter 'snowballed' despite the lawyer trying to apologise on three occasions - but the cashier refused to meet with her. Yesterday, in a ruling made public for the first time, it emerged Mrs Morris who now works two days a week at another law firm has been fined £2,500 and ordered to pay £5,250 in costs following a hearing in London. Her own legal costs are thought to be £1,000 and the incident is believed to have cost in total tens of thousands of pounds in further solicitors' costs and compensation. Earlier the SRA was told the incident occurred after Mrs Morris had been made redundant from her job as assistant solicitor at accident claims firm Mulderiggs based in Rossendale, Lancashire and was working her notice. Probe: Danielle Morris, 34, endured a three and a half year investigation in front of two legal tribunals and almost lost her career after she made the off-the-cuff remark. This is the medical centre which she attended . Trouble began after she attended the Bardoc medical centre in Bury with her baby. The hearing was told a man dressed in Orthodox Jewish attire 'caused a scene' at the surgery and as a result was seen first by a doctor. Back at the law firm Mrs Morris relayed the incident to a receptionist she shared her office with and said: 'I cannot stand Jewish people.' The cashier who also shared the office having joined the firm just three months earlier overheard the rant and said: 'Please do not say that.' But Mrs Morris went on: 'I don’t care, I cannot stand them ever since an incident at Bardoc.' The cashier known as Mrs S made a formal complaint to the firm’s senior partner but left the company ahead of an offer of an apology from the practice if 'any offence had been unwittingly caused.' In May 2011 a four-day employment tribunal was held in which Mrs Morris and the firm was found to have racially and religiously discriminated against Mrs S and she was awarded damages. But in May last year Mrs Morris was then brought before the SRA following a further complaint of discrimination by Mrs S about the incident. Initially she denied making the comment about Jewish people but her lawyer Gareth Edwards later admitted it was 'unintentionally discriminatory remark which arose from foolishness and ignorance, not wickedness.' Mr Edwards said Mrs Morris had tried to apologise to Mrs S but it had not been accepted.He said his client had 'not been aware' of the long history of the persecution of Jewish people. Anger: The mother-of-two had been frustrated after complaining a Jewish man had jumped the queue at a medical centre, pictured, whilst she was waiting to take one of her children to see a doctor . Mr Edwards added: 'Because of her age she has had limited direct contact with those who had been familiar with the discovery of the horrors of the holocaust or the attitudes which had led to these events. 'She now has a greater understanding of the offence she had caused and the context in which her remarks could be seen. ‘This was not a case where she held extreme views or had intended to cause offence. She has mainstream moderate views. 'Many people including solicitors make remarks in haste they would later regret. This incident happened several years ago and she has had the matter hanging over her for all this time.' Mrs Morris who now works part time as a conveyancing lawyer at a practice in Oldham told the hearing she had 'plenty of time to reflect on what happened' and insisted she had no intention of insulting Mrs S. She said she did not know Mrs S was Jewish and had made the remarks 'without thinking in a private environment where she thought it would safe to discuss it.' The tribunal was told she had modest means and lived in a house worth £105,000 with equity of just £30,000. She was working part time as she could not afford the £500 costs in childcare. Her husband who works as maintenance technician earns £20,000 a year. In making its decision on April 9, SRA panel chairman Ken Duncan said the panel accepted Mrs Morris had tried to apologise on three occasions but criticised her for not saying sorry on the day she made the remark and for not writing a personal letter of apology to Mrs S. He also criticised her for initially denying making the remarks. Mr Duncan said: 'What she had said was inappropriate and offensive however it occurred on one occasion only. This was not a situation in which there had been repeated or sustained discrimination. 'The tribunal took into account the fact that the events in issue had taken place over three years ago and she had been under the threat of potentially losing her career for that period. 'The tribunal accepted the remarks made were foolish and ignorant rather than malicious.'","Danielle Morris, 34, made the remark to a .

"Paddy Power's controversial Oscar Pistorius advert has become the most complained about UK advert of all time with more than 5,200 complaints so far, the Advertising Standards Authority said today. The advert, which offered 'money back if he walks' or Pistorius is found not guilty of killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, is to be withdrawn with immediate effect after it received an 'unprecedented number of complaints'. An ASA spokesman said: 'We consider the ad may be seriously prejudicial to the general public on the ground of the likely further serious and/or widespread offence it may cause. Upset: Paddy Power's Oscar Pistorius advert has become the most complained about UK advert of all time with more than 5,200 complaints so far . Pulled: The advert, shown here in its internet version, offered 'money back if he walks' and is to be withdrawn with immediate effect after it received an 'unprecedented number of complaints' 'We are also concerned that the good reputation of the advertising industry may be further damaged by continued publication of this ad.' The advert featured a photograph of Pistorius, a double amputee Olympic racer and a Paralympic gold medallist, mocked up as an Academy Award statuette. It took the title of the most complained-about UK ad of all time from Kentucky Fried Chicken, whose 2005 campaign featuring call centre workers singing with their mouths full drew 1,671 complaints. The ASA had previously said it was investigating whether the advert was offensive for trivialising several issues, including the fact it is a murder trial, Ms Steenkamp’s death and Pistorius’s disability. Prejudice: The ASA said the Pistorius advert could be seriously prejudicial to the general public . Probe: The ASA had previously said it was investigating whether the advert was offensive for trivialising several issues, including the fact it is a murder trial, Ms Steenkamp's death and Pistorius's disability . On trial: Pistorius is surrounded by security personnel as he leaves the High Court this afternoon after the third day of his murder trial, in Pretoria . A spokesman said that it was also looking at whether, in doing so, it brings the reputation of advertising into disrepute. ASA chairman Lord Smith took the unusual step of directing the advertiser to withdraw the ad from circulation pending the outcome of the investigation, which had been fast tracked. Only in exceptional circumstances do the watchdog’s procedures under the Advertising Code allow it to take interim action and have ads amended or withdrawn pending investigation. The national advertising campaign featured the words: 'It’s Oscar Time. Money Back If He Walks. We will refund all losing bets on the Oscar Pistorius trial if he is found not guilty.' Tragic: Prosecutors allege Pistorius shot model Reeva Steenkamp through the bathroom door at his home on Valentines' Day in 2013 . The ASA’s decision comes as a change.org online petition demanding that Paddy Power 'please remove your offensive betting on the outcome of the Oscar Pistorius trial and donate any profits so far to a women’s charity fighting violence against women' drew more than 120,000 supporters. Protesters from around the globe who have signed the petition condemned the bet as 'reprehensible” and 'shameless behaviour'. Others declared that Paddy Power had gone 'too far this time, too far' and that the 'death of a woman should not be used as a publicity stunt. A new disgusting low for the UK'. The petition was addressed to Paddy Power’s chief executive Patrick Kennedy and stated: 'Please consider the vast surge of public outrage against the terrible decision you have taken to offer bets upon the outcome of the Oscar Pistorius trial. '(Reeva Steenkamp’s) death is not and should never be a source of entertainment or profit. 'I have seen your attempt to explain the decision and it is unacceptable. 138 women died in the UK last year as a result of male violence against women. 'This is not something that should be seen as ‘sport’. In order to salvage the situation it would be an act of reparation and humanity to donate any profits to relevant women’s charities working in the area of domestic violence and abuse.' The advert coincided with the Oscar ceremony in Los Angeles and the first day of Pistorius’ trial in South Africa, where he formally pleaded not guilty to four charges including the murder of Miss Steenkamp. Prosecutors allege Pistorius, 27, shot his model and reality TV star girlfriend through the bathroom door at his home on Valentines’ Day in 2013. Pistorius claims he mistook her for an intruder. Complaints: A change.org petition calling for Paddy Power to pull the advert garnered more than 120,000 supporters . Holly Dustin, director of End Violence Against Women, said of the ad: 'They are making a game out of murder and the brutal killing of a young woman, which is unacceptable. 'It is not just that this is a bit sick - it also actually contributes to a culture in which violence against women is trivialised or made into a bit of a joke. 'This is a really serious problem. It is recognised as a human rights issue both here in the UK and in South Africa. It is totally unacceptable. They should withdraw the ad.' This KFC campaign drew 1,671 complaints .

"Attempts so far have been bulky and lacked functionality, but now Samsung has unveiled the world’s first smartwatch that can make and receive calls without the aid of a nearby smartphone. LG has also debuted a more traditional-looking timepiece. Its G Watch R has a circular plastic OLED screen, stainless steel frame and a leather strap. Scroll down for video . Samsung has unveiled what it claims is the world’s first smartwatch that can make and receive calls without the aid of a nearby smartphone. The Gear S and has a larger curved AMOLED screen than its predecessors at two inches (5cm). It is designed to fit comfortably on the wearer’s wrist . All eyes will also be on Apple’s iPhone 6 launch in two weeks, to see whether the Californianfirm will also announce its own version of a smartwatch. Samsung, the world’s biggest smartphone manufacturer, was early to launch a range of smartwatches and bands in a bid to counter slow earnings in its mobile division. But their appeal and functionality was limited. Its new watch is called the Gear S and has a larger curved AMOLED screen than its predecessors at two inches (5cm). It is designed to fit comfortably on the wearer’s wrist. The watch is large enough so that users will be able to read messages and notifications at a glance. The screen can be customised – as well as the colour of the straps. It will offer 3G, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, so that users can receive notifications from social networks, calendars and apps, without needing to use their smartphone. People wearing the device will be able to reply to messages by using an onscreen keyboard or ‘S voice functionality’ so they can dictate a message. LG has also debuted a more traditional-looking timepiece. Its G Watch R (pictured) has a circular plastic OLED screen, stainless steel frame and a leather strap . Screen: 2inch Super AMOLED . Chip: Dual core 1 GHz . Memory: 4GB /512 RAM . Operating system: Tizen . Communications: 2G, 3G call and Bluetooth call, contacts, messages, email and QWERTY keyboard . Health features: S Health, Nike+ Running . Media features: Music player and photo gallery . Connectivity: Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth 4.1, USB 2.0 . Sensors: Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Compass, Heart Rate, Ambient Light, UV, Barometer . Dimensions: 40mm x 58mm x 13mm . Release date: October . Price: Net year confirmed . Critically, they will also be able to make and answer phone calls. Turn-by-turn pedestrian navigation is on offer with built-in GPS, and because the watch includes sensors, it will be able to be used as a health and fitness device. The South Korean company said the Gear S ‘expands the smartphone experience to the wrist’. ‘Through 3G connectivity, the Samsung Gear S offers a new, powerful wearable experience and gives consumers the freedom to live their life on the go.’ Samsung said that the Gear S will go on sale in October, but it is not yet known how much it will cost and whether it will be available in the UK. LG’s watch is set to launch slightly later – sometime in the fourth quarter. No price has yet been revealed. The company said: ‘The LG G Watch R will be the world’s first watch-style wearable device to feature a full circle Plastic OLED (P-OLED) display that utilises100 percent of its circular display.’ ‘With an artisanal elegance, the LG G Watch R boasts a refined aesthetic that is reminiscent of traditional timepieces.’ The display is 1.3 inches in diameter and promises clarity when viewed from any angle, including in direct sunlight. Samsung – the world’s biggest smartphone manufacturer - was early to launch a range of smart watches and bands in a bid to counter slow earnings in its mobile decision. The Gear Fit (pictured left) and Gear 2 (right) had limited appeal and functionality . Screen: 1.3inch P-OLED display . Chip: 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 . Memory: 4GB / 512 RAM . Operating system: Android Wear . Sensors: 9-axis . Colours: Black only with leather strap . Release date: October . Price: Not yet confirmed . It will run on Google’s Android operating system, so wearers can access apps on Google Play. Like Samsung’s offering, the watch will use voice recognition and has sensors to monitor a user’s heartbeat so that it can be used with fitness apps. Notifications will inform users of events, missed calls, reminders and messages – but unlike Samsung’s offering, a smartphone will be needed to make a call, making the watch an accessory and not an alternative to a phone. Dr Jong-seok Park, president and CEO of the LG Electronics, said: ‘What we’ve noticed in the year of the wearable is that this is a category that can’t be compared to smartphones and tablets. ‘Wearables are also accessories and consumers will want more than one to choose from.’ A spokesman from Carphone Warehouse told MailOnline: ‘While many mobile manufacturers have now shown their hand with at least their first foray into the wearables space, Samsung’s device marks the beginning for the next generation of smart wearable technology, in which manufacturers are beginning to really respond to evolving customer needs for more practical yet stylish devices. ‘We are getting more and more customers enquiring about smart watches and similar devices and with more sophisticated and mainstream devices coming onto the market, we anticipate that even more customers will be looking for a wearable device that resonates with their needs.’","Samsung's Gear S and has a large 2inch curved AMOLED screen .
