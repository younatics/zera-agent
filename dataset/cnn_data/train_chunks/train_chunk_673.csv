Tragic: Salon owner Fay Wesley, above, swallowed the shard after applying English mustard to her home-cooked meal . A businesswoman died after swallowing a sharp 'slither' of glass which had come from a jar of English mustard, an inquest has heard. Hair salon owner Fay Wesley, 68, consumed the shard shortly after sitting down to a steak dinner with her husband Alan. It pierced her carotid artery, . causing a massive bleed behind her throat which led to a . swelling of the airways and a lack of oxygen to brain. An investigation into her death revealed the undamaged jar of mustard which she had taken the condiment from had 29 more pieces of glass concealed in the thick yellow sauce. Despite a thorough examination of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a coroner today admitted the appearance of glass in the jar was a 'mystery' before recording a verdict of accidental death. Mrs Wesley had planned a night in on March 14 this year, preparing a meal of steak, peas and dumplings for herself and her spouse. An inquest heard how, while her Alan, her husband of 51-years had opted for French mustard, the hairdresser chose the English version and the jar which was riddled with glass. As she ate,  Mrs Wesley became 'very unwell very quickly' the inquest was told. Alan, dressed all in black, told the hearing in Newbury, Berkshire: . 'She grabbed her throat and said ""I’ve got a piece of glass in my mouth"" Then she took it out. 'It was about an inch long and a quarter of an inch thick.' The 72-year-old widower described the fragment as a 'slither', adding: 'The last words she said to me were ‘pat me on the back’ Desperate Mrs Wesley panicked and tried to leave . the . couple’s £300,000 home in Harts Hill Road, near Upper Bucklebury, . Berkshire. But neighbours, including one retired Met police officer laid her down in the hallway while paramedics rushed to the scene. Recalling the moment, Mr Wesley said: 'By that time she had gone, really.' Mrs . Wesley was taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading and later . transferred to Southampton General Hospital, Hampshire. She died on . the afternoon of March 21. A subsequent investigation examined Mrs Wesley’s final meal and the jar of English mustard she had taken sauce from. Detective . Constable Emma Daly, of Thames Valley Police, told the inquest: 'The . contents of the jar were examined, which revealed fragments of glass. 'There were some 30 fragments of glass found in the mustard. There was no damage to the jar found.' No shards of glass were found in the remains of Mrs Wesley’s dinner. A search of glassware in the couple’s home found no indication of where the fragments could have originated. Injuries: Mrs Wesley died from her injuries at Southampton General Hospital above . Forensic crime scene investigator Stuart Gray said: 'The jar had a very old, worn label with a sell-by date of 2011 and appeared to be from Marks and Spencer.' It is now known where the mustard was bought from as it was not consistent with the labels on the jar. Mr Gray added that there was no evidence of any damage to the jar. He could not find any other crockery in the house with damaged glass and added: 'The . origin of this chip was not identified and could well have been . disposed of by the homeowners between making the contents and . consuming.' Recording a conclusion of accidental . death, Dr Fegan-Earl said: 'It seems something of a mystery as to . exactly where this glass may have come from.' Addressing . Mr Wesley, he said: 'If we look at the evidence very clearly, your meal . had no glass in it whatsoever and really the only difference between . your two meals was that you had French mustard and she had English . mustard. 'We do know there were some 30 shards of glass recovered from that mustard pot. 'While there is no obvious evidence of damage, one must assume that the shards must have come from there. 'Sadly I don’t think we can take it any further as to where that came from. 'It is, to my mind, an almost unique occurrence and one that we cannot really take any further.' He . added: 'I don’t think anyone could have predicted that this could . happen and a careful police investigation has failed to find any cause . for concern or, indeed, the exact source of the glass.'","Fay Wesley, 68, applied the English mustard to her home-cooked steak .

A tiger at the Sacramento Zoo underwent successful surgery Tuesday to help ease its suffering due to urinary tract stones. Castro the Sumatran tiger had a tube implanted that helps drain urine from this kidneys to his bladder. The 15-year-old tiger is now recovering from the surgery and his keepers say he’s going to be A-OK. Scroll down for video . Surgery: Castro, a 15-year-old Sumatran tiger from the Sacramento Zoo, undergoes surgery to correct problems he suffered from urinary tract stones . Father: Castro's species is critically endangered and he's personally helped the cause by siring several cubs. Zoo officials said he's recovering well from Tuesday's surgery . ‘Castro did well today,’ veterinarian Ray Wack told the Sacramento Bee. ‘We are very happy with the way he handled the anesthesia and procedures and he’s up and recovering in his building.’ As one vital specimen of an endangered species, Castro has played a significant role in keeping Sumatran tigers, the smallest of the world’s six tigers, intact. ‘Castro is the oldest breeding male Sumatran in the country,’ Wack said. Castro’s mate Bahagia produced a cub most recently on March 3. A month before that, Castro got some bad news: he was diagnosed with lymphoma, a form of cancer. ‘Keepers noticed he was not eating as eagerly and had lost a little weight,’ said Wack. ‘The lymphoma was probably centered in his spleen.’ A fighter: Castro was diagnosed with lymphoma in February and his condition had been improving, aside from his urinary tract issues, since he began chemotherapy . While his condition has improved thanks to chemotherapy, his urinary tract issues became pressing when they threatened to block the tiger’s ability to urinate. ‘That would be an emergency,’ Wack said. ‘He would get really sick, really quick.’ Thirty specialists took part in the procedure and helped get the tiger-sized stent placed in Castro. While the surgery would normally have cost around $10,000, Wack said the community pitched in and offset the costs. They ended up costing the zoo just $2,000. But even if they’d had to pay the entire cost of the surgery, Wack said it would have been worth it. Castro is one of about 200 Sumatran tigers in captivity worldwide and an estimated 500 remain in the wild. ‘Hopefully, that will fix that partial obstruction. We are trying to give him the best quality of life we can. He’s getting up there.’","Castro the Sumatran tiger has urinary tract stones and had a tube implanted to fix the problem on Tuesday .

A 45-year-old father of two has described the moment he punched at a Great White Shark and let out a caveman-like scream in order to survive an attack from the ocean's deadliest creature. College English teacher Jay Scrivner, of California, was out for an early morning surf at his regular spot in Humboldt Bay, Eureka - a known shark ground where a friend of his, Scott Stephens, almost died last year. Scrivner had been in the water about two hours, with friends and other surfers around, when something just hit him. So lucky: Unlike many, Jay Scrivner, a keen surfer and College teacher, encountered a Great White Shark and lived to tell the tale . Petrifying: Great whites are considered one of (if not the) deadliest creature in the ocean. They have been seen before in the spot Jay Scrivner was surfing near the Californian town of Eureka where he lives . Recovery: This photo - taken by Sunni Scrivner, Jay's wife, the day after the attack - shows Scrivner in Eureka's St Joseph Hospital after having 30 stitches in his thigh following a shark attack . 'Sometimes you have a feeling that the water is weird,' Scrivner said on Monday from his hospital bed at Eureka's St Joseph Hospital. 'But everyone was just so happy. I was lying on my board, paddling around just waiting for a wave set.' Moments later Scrivner realized every surfers worst fears - the sight of a shark's teeth and nose suddenly came 'out of nowhere'. Not yet aware of what had happened, Scrivner took a swing at the great white, which he estimated was 8-to-9 feet long, and let what a friend who was nearby a 'primordial yell' (a primal scream). 'I couldn't believe it happened,' Scrivner said. 'When I turned away from the shark, I said, ''Did I really get bit?'' Your mind doesn't believe it.' Scrivner said he did a quick inventory of his body parts and found everything was intact. However he had been bitten on the thigh. Family photo: Jay Scrivner with his wife Sunni and their son August (left) and daughter Luan (right) Close call: Jay Scrivner is lucky to be alive after being attacked by a shark in California. Here, he is pictured with his wife Sunni, daughter Luan and son August . Jay Scrivner teaches son August how to play golf. Scrivner has survived a shark attack while surfing a spot called Samoa Peninsula . A friend encouraged him to keep paddling toward the beach. Once there, friends and fellow surfers applied pressure on the wound and tied a T-shirt to stop the bleeding. 'What's strange about it was how amazing the morning was, how everyone was having a good time, and then the dichotomy,' Scrivner said. Scrivner was alert and conscious on shore when rescue crews got to the scene around 8:45 a.m, Samoa Peninsula Fire District Chief Dale Unea said. Scrivner said the bite wound on his left thigh did not sever an artery or damage any tendons. There was some muscle tissue damage that required about 30 stitches, but he was expected to fully recover. He said he thinks he was spared from more damage by his old surf board, which is thicker than many modern boards. ""If you're going to get bitten by a shark, I had the best scenario,"" he said. Scrivner said he will 'definitely surf again'. But ominously, he admitted to already having had a dream in which something was tugging on his surfboard leash. 'There's just a power in the ocean,' Scrivner said. 'When you see a shark or get bitten by a shark, you're just made critically aware of that power.' It's not the first time a surfer has been made critically aware of a shark in the same spot. Scott Stephens, a surfer pal of Scivner, was pulled underwater by a great white at Samoa Peninsula in November last year. Doctors say Stephens suffered at least seven deep lacerations, but none of his vital organs was damaged. 'Mid-paddle, from behind me and out of the corner of my left eye . something dark broke the surface and I felt a weight land on my back,' Stephens wrote in an editorial about the attack for Surf Transworld. 'My . first thought was it was a large seal, but as I was being drug . underwater, feeling the force and power of being shaken in the jaws of a . top predator, I began fearing for my life. I felt so small and . insignificant, but I opened my eyes underwater and came face to face . with the first shark I’d seen in 13 years of surfing.' 'My right fist made contact with the shark just behind this eye. It felt . like punching a bag of concrete. I can’t describe what I was feeling at . this moment—some eerie combination of shock and terror. And then as . quickly as the attack had started, it was all over. I was released, and . the shark was gone into the depths.'","Sunday morning surf in Eureka, California, ends with Jay Scrivner lucky to be alive .

Employees who work through lunch appear less tired at the end of the day if they had the freedom to choose how they spent their break. According to a new study, socialising over lunch may not be the best way to unwind during the day if it's with the wrong crowd. Those who spent their lunch mingling with co-workers, or if the boss was around, felt less relaxed at lunch and more tired at the end of the day. Working through lunch may not be so bad, especially when employees choose to do so without pressure . This is because conversations may be about work, and . employees may be more careful about what they say and the impression . they make with their colleagues, according to John Trougakos, an associate professor and co-author of the study. Researchers at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management concluded working through lunch may not be so bad, especially when employees choose to do so without pressure. 'We found that a critical element was having the freedom to choose whether to do it or not,' said John Trougakos, an associate professor and co-author of the study. 'The autonomy aspect helps to offset what we had traditionally thought was not a good way to spend break time.' Researchers asked employees what they had done during their lunch breaks over 10 days. They then followed up with the participants' co-workers to report how tired their colleagues appeared by the end of each workday. The authors found that while working through lunch did result in employees appearing more tired, the effect was reduced when employees felt it was their decision. The study revealed that socialising also led to higher levels of fatigue, which researchers attribute to whether or not workers feel free to decide if they want to socialise and who they're socialising with. Relaxing activities during lunch, freely chosen by workers, led to the least amount of reported fatigue at the end of the day. Trougakos said while many might assume lunchtime socializing is a good way for employees to relax, that's not necessarily the case if they mingle with other employees in the company cafeteria or if the boss is around. In those instances, Trougakos said conversations may be about work, and employees may be more careful about what they say and the impression they make with their colleagues. 'You're hanging out with people who you can't necessarily kick back and be yourself with,' Trougakos said. Workers may not relax if they mingle with other employees in the company cafeteria or if the boss is around . Regardless of how it is achieved, researchers believe organisations that don't provide opportunities for their workers to recover from work during the day risk lower employee effectiveness and productivity, leading to burnout, absenteeism and higher staff turnover. The study, co-authored by University of Toronto Ph.D. student Bonnie Cheng, and professors Ivona Hideg of Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario, Canada, and Daniel Beal of the University of Texas-San Antonio, is scheduled to be published in the Academy of Management Journal.","University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management studied workers .

Reforms: Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his speech in Ankara where he announced a relaxation of a ban on headscarves . Turkey has taken the first step towards ending the country's long-standing ban on headscarves for women sitting in Parliament and working in the civil service. The reform of the rule on Islamic dress, which dates back to the early days of the Turkish Republic, is potentially incendiary, pitching the government against the secular elite. It follows a summer of persistent, sometimes violent demonstrations in Turkey's biggest towns and cities, involving protesters who have accused the country's leaders of following an Islamist agenda. Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan unveiled the proposal on headscarves yesterday as part of a big package of long-delayed liberalising reforms. It will lift a ban preventing women in public offices from wearing Islamic dress, except in those jobs that require uniforms such as the military and security services, and the courts. In the past the ban has kept many women from joining the public work force, contributing to a relatively low female employment rate which has been regarded as one of the Turkey's economic weaknesses. But the issue has exacerbated tension between religious and secular elites, one of the major fault lines in Turkish public life. Erdogan has already eased the ban on head scarves at universities and religious schools, drawing fierce criticism from secularists who see the government pushing an Islamic agenda. Tear gas enveloped Turkey's streets in June and July in a fierce crackdown on mass demonstrations against Mr Erdogan's AK Party, which has been accused of creeping authoritarianism.

A woman holds a large squirt gun to parody water . cannons used by police: Four people were killed and 7,500 wounded in . last summer's police crackdown, according to the Turkish Medical . Association . In a wide-ranging, major policy speech yesterday Mr Erdogan also announced reforms designed to salvage a peace process aimed at ending a conflict with Kurdish insurgents. Turkey's Kurds, who make up around a fifth of the country's 76million population, have for many years been denied political rights, leading to one of Europe's longest-running, and most under-reported ethnic conflicts. Changes to the electoral system, a broadening of language rights and permission for villages to reinstate their original Kurdish names were all proposed in an effort to extend a hand to separatists. Turkey's human rights record has been badly tarnished by its handling of the insurgency by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has crippled the economy in the mainly Kurdish south-east of the country. More than 40,000 people have been killed in fighting since 1984. Other reforms include allowing election campaigns to be conducted in languages other than Turkish and decriminalising the use of Kurdish letters not found in the Turkish alphabet. All primary school students in state schools will now also no longer have to recite a deeply nationalistic vow at the start of each week, which begins with the words: 'I am a Turk'. People watch Mr Erdogan's speech at a coffee . shop in Istanbul yesterday: Turkey's prime minister also announced . reforms designed to salvage a peace process to end a 30-year . conflict with Kurdish insurgents . Mr Erdogan has invested much political capital in the peace initiative, which has drawn strong public support. But he is increasingly attracting fierce nationalist criticism over the perceived concessions to militants who are officially labelled terrorists. In his speech, Mr Erdogan said parliament would debate whether to reduce the threshold for a political party to enter parliament to 5 per cent of the national vote, or even eliminate the barrier completely. The current 10 per cent threshold, among the highest in the world, has kept pro-Kurdish parties out of parliament and has been one of the main grievances of the Kurds. Mr Erdogan said his 'democratisation package' would also allow for education in languages other than Turkish at non-state schools, another long-held demand by Kurdish politicians. He told a news conference in Ankara: 'Today our country, our nation, is experiencing an historic moment. It is passing through a very important stage. 'We are taking important steps to make Turkey even greater.' He added: 'Our people's greatest wish is to strengthen our domestic peace, further our social cohesion and solidarity, and fortify our tranquillity.'

Oppression: Turkey's human rights record has . been badly tarnished by its handling of the Kurdish insurgency, which . has killed 40,000 since 1984 and crippled the economy in the south-east . of the country . While Mr Erdogan reiterated that the proposed reforms are not directly linked with efforts to end the 29-year conflict with the outlawed PKK, the changes are largely viewed as an effort to advance the flagging peace process. But the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) said the proposals were not enough to satisfy Kurdish militants, who this month halted their withdrawal from Turkish territory. BDP co-chairman Gultan Kisanak said: 'The democratisation package does not meet our expectations. The package does not have the capacity to overcome blockages in the peace process.' Ms Kisanak criticised Mr Erdogan's proposed reform on mother tongue instruction in schools as this would only apply to private fee-paying institutions. And she reiterated the BDP's demand to eliminate the vote threshold entirely, saying any lowering of the barrier would not justly represent the votes. Jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and Turkish officials began peace talks almost a year ago, and in March rebels called a halt to hostilities. The ceasefire has largely held but earlier this month the PKK warned that hostilities could resume without concrete action by the government. The government accuses the militants of failing to live up to their side of a bargain, and Mr Erdogan has previously said only 20 per cent of the PKK fighters had withdrawn from Turkey.","Potentially incendiary proposal pitches government against secular elite .

One in four people no longer believes in any religion, official analysis of national census returns found yesterday. It revealed Christianity is in decline and Christians are increasingly likely to be older or retired people. Many young people, young men in particular, appear to be rejecting religious belief altogether. Nearly one in three under-25s – 32 per cent – say they do not have a religion. Dwindling: The number of Christians in Britain has fallen by 4.1million in the past decade . The rise of atheism has gathered pace in the decade since 2001, the census showed, a period when churches found themselves under pressure from equality laws and secular groups. At the same time the UK’s second-biggest religion, Islam, frequently found itself on the defensive because of the actions of extremist groups. The 2011 census showed the number of Christians fell by 4.1million to 33.2million. Of these, only a third attend church outside of weddings, baptisms or funerals. There was a 45 per cent rise over the same period in those who say they have no religion, to 14.1million in 2001. While the decline of religion was at its fastest among young people, there has been ‘an increase in the reporting of no religion across all groups between 2001 and 2011’, the Office for National Statistics said. Change: Christianity is in decline and Christians are increasingly likely to be older or retired people . More than nine out of ten of those without religion are white and born in Britain, and they include the highest proportion of people who are in work of any group of believers or non-believers. The city where religion is in the greatest decline is Norwich, where 42.5 per cent of the population say they have no belief. But there are five areas where more than half those under 25 say they have no religion: Norwich and Brighton and Hove in England, and Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, and Rhondda Cynon Taf in Wales. The most Christian area in England and Wales was Knowsley on Merseyside, where more than four out of five people, 81 per cent, professed Christianity.","One in four people in Britain no longer believes in any religion .

Extradition: Calls have been made for an alleged henchman of Franco (pictured) to face trial . A man alleged to have been a torturer under the brutal fascist dictatorship of General Franco's Spain has been discovered living a quiet life in Madrid. Antonio Gonzalez Pacheco, known as 'Billy the Kid' for his habit of spinning a gun around his finger as he beat his victims, is wanted by Interpol and has been accused of torturing members of the republican opposition. He is said to have been particularly sadistic during Franco's regime, even allegedly telling his victims how much he was enjoying hurting them. After Franco's death in 1975, Pacheco joined the police's anti-terrorism unit, helping to fight the Basque separatist group, Eta. He then went on to work for a private security firm, where he is said to remain employed to this day. A photograph published by newspaper El Mundo on Sunday showed the alleged henchman taking part in the Madrid half marathon in 2010. He was wearing the traditional black and red colours of Spain's fascist Falange party. In an article in The Guardian, it was claimed Pacheco regularly runs marathons in Spain and Budapest, and had even flown out to attend the New York Marathon. Last month Argentine judge Maria Romilda Servinie de Cubria called for his extradition, along with three other men who were also accused of carrying out Franco's dirty work. She was responding to a petition from his alleged victims' lawyers in Spain. While two of his co-accused are now . dead, Gonzalez Pacheco and another former police officer, Jesus Munecas . Aguilar, could be summoned over the extradition request. Gonzalez Pacheco has now gone into hiding. Pressure is now growing on Spain to address the crimes committed under Franco's regime, which lasted for 36 years. Tribute: Fascist supporters of General Franco pay tribute to the former dictator in 2000 . Last week a UN delegation called for a public investigation. Warrants were issued for Gonzalez Pacheco and his compatriots under an international law allowing human rights abuses to be investigated and tried elsewhere if the country in which they occurred did not investigate. The same law was used in the case of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1998. In the case involving Gonzalez Pacheco, the alleged victims went to Argentina after failing to get anywhere in Spain, where an amnesty was passed in 1977 preventing trials for any crimes committed before 1976. There are believed to be up to 114,000 bodies buried across the country - the victims of atrocities committed under the regime. A further 30,000 children were taken from their parents, many of whom have never been found. Lawyer acting for the claimants, Carlos Slepoy, said: 'Spain runs the risk of becoming a refuge for criminals if it refuses to investigate these crimes here, and does not allow Argentina to.' A Spanish ministry of justice spokeswoman promised to study the case documents as soon as they had been received from Argentina. Brutal: The Fascist general was to rule Spain with an iron grip for 36 years . The Spanish Civil War is considered a watershed moment in 20th century European history because it tipped the balance of power in favour of the Fascist movement. In 1929 the military dictatorship that had been ruling Spain collapsed. Two years later the King of Spain abdicated when the left-wing Republicans came to power. It set in motion a bitter battle for power that was to be played out in the deeply divided country over the next seven years. When the army rebelled in 1936, the country slipped into all out civil war, with the Nationalists, made up of landowners, business owners, the gentry and the church, on one side, against the Republicans, comprising the workers and peasants, on the other. Led by General Francisco Franco and supplied with weapons by Hitler's Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Fascist Italy, the Nationalists had the upper hand. Although the Republicans were assisted by Communist Russia, they did not receive the same level of support and were finally defeated in 1939, just months before the outbreak of the Second World War. Britain and France had both signed a non-assistance pact preventing aid from reaching Spain, although they were powerless to stop Germany's help from getting through. Many young inspired Brits rushed to help the Republican movement, with eminent writers George Orwell and Laurie Lee among them. Franco was to rule the country with an iron grip for 36 years between 1939 and 1975 and survived the fall of Fascism in Italy and Nazism in Germany after the Second World War. His regime had remained neutral throughout the conflict. He effectively ruled Spain as a dictator from 1939 until his death, and brutally oppressed political opponents during that period, although the precise numbers of those who died or disappeared as a consequence of his policies is unknown.","Antonio Gonzalez Pacheco has been accused of torturing republicans .

The foreign press treated news of the shutdown with bemusement but little surprise - although some commenters expressed concern that gridlock could stunt other economic recoveries. And on social media, users poked fun at the government while federal employees who are forced to take time off both celebrated and complained about not being able to work. The impassioned responses came after the government closed for the first time in 17 years as it failed to come to an agreement over its spending bill. It meant that non-essential services were shut, forcing some 800,000 workers to take unpaid leave. Closed for business: An office for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in West Bend, Wisconsin displays a sign on Tuesday saying it is closed 'due to the lapse in federal government funding' The shutdown, which came as Republicans and Democrats clashed over Obamacare, could cost the economy a staggering $1 billion a week - which the rest of the world promptly pointed out. 'It is a risk to the world economy if the US can't properly sort out its spending plans,' British Prime Minister David Cameron told BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday. In Germany, Der Spiegel Online claimed 'a superpower has paralyzed itself' while The Welt said the could be 'fatal consequences' that could damage the U.S. recovery. But it also noted that the world's markets did not panic and there has been little impact, which suggests it had been expected for weeks and priced in accordingly. Derision: An editorial in Le Monde on Tuesday was headlined, 'Jefferson, wake up, they've all gone crazy!' as it warned the shutdown could spell bad news for the Republicans . Mocked: The world's media laughed at the world superpower's inability to reach an agreement . No access: A barrier blocks the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial in D.C. Tuesday as national parks were closed . In France, Le Monde noted that the last government shutdown cost $1.4 billion (or $2 billion today), and turned the public against the Republicans, whom voters blamed for the chaos. 'Jefferson, wake up, they’ve gone crazy!' Le Monde said in an editorial, calling the shutdown 'grotesque'. The French were clear to point out that the repercussions were being felt across the Atlantic Ocean as the American cemeteries in France from World War II were closed as a result of the shutdown. In the UK, The Guardian noted called it 'bizarre' and that the final hours 'could well have been scripted by Hollywood' as the sides worried more about who was going to get the blame for the shutdown rather than actually stopping it. The Australian also derided the U.S. system, writing that the inability to reach a decision didn't 'say . much for the budgetary processes in the world's largest economy'. It comes as little surprise that the Russian press saw the shutdown as an opportunity for ridicule though some of the sting got lost in translation. The Rossliskaya Gazeta splashed a headline reading 'The ""Elephants"" are Robbing the U.S. Government', making a play on the Republican mascot. The largest newspaper in South Korea made a point to calm local concerns, reiterating that the shutdown would not lead to any military reductions for American troops abroad, as the U.S. plays a pivotal role in their regional security when it comes to North Korea. In the U.S., commentators and the public expressed their dismay on social networks - and even Obama had something to say. 'They actually did it,' his Twitter feed read. 'A group of Republicans in the House just forced a government shutdown over Obamacare instead of passing a real budget.' Fighting back: Protestors demonstrated by the Capitol demanding the House pass a Continuing Resolution without any amendments that attempted to defund the Affordable Care Act . Keeping history locked up: One of the clearest examples of the effect of the shutdown comes from the closure of all National Parks . NASA Voyager 2 quipped: 'Due to government shutdown, we will not be posting or responding from this account. Farewell, humans. Sort it out yourselves.' A mock U.S. government Twitter account added: 'The government is currently on shutdown. Be prepared for no noticeable difference. The government wasnt working anyways.' And Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane wrote: 'Per several Family Guy episodes: whenever there’s a government shutdown, we can all steal a zoo animal. Go get yours.' Other users who are being forced to stay at home as they are deemed non-essential workers also had something to say - with some enjoying their days off in the sun. 'Spending my #furlough day drinking sangria and eating nutella crepes,' one wrote. Amber Straughn, a NASA astrophysicist, added: 'Mid-day #furlough run!  Nice day out there. Except for, ya know, the inability to do my job.'","International press suggested shutdown could be bad news for fragile economies .

The inventor who developed wrinkle-resistant cotton has died at the age of 97. Dr. Ruth Benerito, who created the material in the 1950s, died on Saturday at her home in Louisiana. She is credited with saving the cotton industry as the introduction of synthetic fibres in the 1930s and 1940s led many consumers to turn to the the easy-care fabric. The achievement 'is considered one of the most significant technological developments of the 20th century.' Her obituary in the New York Times reads: 'A . chemist long affiliated with the United States Department of . Agriculture, Dr. Benerito helped perfect modern wrinkle-free cotton, . colloquially known as permanent press, in work that she and her . colleagues began in the late 1950s,'. Dr Benerito grew up in New Orleans, and started at H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College of Tulane University at 15. The daughter of a civil engineer and an artist, she credited her parents as being her inspiration saying: 'My father was the one who believed in education. He said the only thing we would get would be a good education and nobody could take them away from you.' Her graduation during the Great Depression meant she was forced to take a job in a high school, but she took night classes to earn her master's degree as well as earning a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1948. High flier: Dr Benerito grew up in New Orleans, and started at H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College of Tulane University at 15 . Inspiration: She credited her parents with inspiriting her to reach her potential . She went to work at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Southern Regional Research Laboratories . in New Orleans, where she spent most of her prolific career. During . the Korean War she developed a way to deliver fat intravenously to . patients who were too ill to eat -a method used to feed seriously . wounded soldiers. She explained: 'They wanted some emulsion that you could give in addition to glucose that would help the people that were wounded.' Union: She married Frank Benerito in 1950 and went to work at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Southern Regional Research Laboratories in New Orleans . Invention: Dr. Benerito and her colleagues helped perfect modern wrinkle-free cotton in the late 1950s . In the 1950s Benerito’s research team began to look into cotton and discovered how to treat cotton fibers so that these chainlike cellulose molecules were chemically joined. The Chemical Heritage Foundation writes: 'At the time, chemists knew that cellulose molecules could stick to each other by way of hydrogen bonds, but hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken, making cotton fabric prone to wrinkling. 'The new treatment strengthened the bonds between cellulose molecules by inserting short organic molecules between them, rather like the rungs of a ladder. The new product was one enormous molecule with different properties from the original cellulose molecules. This “crosslinking” made cotton wrinkle-resistant.' Driven: After her retirement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, she went on to teach at the University of New Orleans until she was 81 . The same chemistry also faciliated the ability to incorporate flame retardants into children's sleepwear, mattresses and uniforms for firefighters and the military. But Benerito repeatedly denied she was the sole inventor of wrinkle-free cotton. 'I don’t like it to be said that I invented wash-wear, because there were any number of people working on it, and there are various processes by which you give cotton those properties,' she said. 'No one person discovered it or was responsible for it. But I contributed to new processes of doing it.' In later years, while she continued to research cotton fibers, Benerito taught classes part-time at Tulane and at the University of New Orleans. She retired from the USDA in 1986 but kept on teaching at the University of New Orleans until she was aged 81. Her husband, Frank Benerito, died in 1970. At the age of 86, she received the . prestigious Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement Award for her work on . textiles and her commitment to education.

It is the bane of many a woman’s life – but something men often believe is a figment of the imagination. Now, one U.S. doctor has declared that woman really do suffer more – largely because they have longer intestines. Dr Robynne Chutkan, a gastroenterologist and founder of the Digestive Centre for Women in Washington D.C., explained to The Atlantic that there are major differences between the male and female digestive tracts. Dr Robynne Chutkan says there are major differences between the male and female digestive tracts, with women's colons on average 10cm more than men - which means they are more likely to suffer from bloating . Firstly, women have a longer colon than . men – on average around 10cm longer – perhaps to allow them to absorb . more water or fluid during childbearing. ‘Because you have to keep the amniotic fluid replete, and the circulation and blood volume increases during pregnancy,’ she explained in an interview to promote her new book, Gutbliss. ‘And what that extra length in the colon does is create this redundancy, these sort of extra twists and turns, and that’s why women are so much more bloated and constipated than their male counterparts. ‘So there’s that difference in length as well as redundancy. Think of the male colon as kind of a gentle horseshoe, and the female colon as being a tangled-up Slinky.’ In the interview, she goes on to explain that men and woman have different shaped pelvises. Because women's are round and men's are narrow, more of a woman’s colon drops down into the pelvis because the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes are taking up space above it – whereas men simply have to make room for the prostate. Dr Chutkan, a gastroenterologist, says weaker abdominal walls due to hormone differences are also to blame for women suffering more bloating . Hormones are also to blame, she says. Men’s higher levels of testosterone mean they have a strong abdominal wall – so their bowel is better held in place. Women, however, have a weaker abdominal wall due to their hormones, so the bowels aren’t so contained, causing bloating. Pregnancy only makes this worse. Add in the fluctuating levels of the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which also affect the digestive tract, and bloating is definitely more of an issue for women, she says. Furthermore, constipation can be caused by a weak pelvic floor – most often a result of childbirth or ageing. ‘If you just do the basic things like give them a fibre supplement to help them get stuff out, and the problem is a pelvic floor issue, they’re actually going to feel worse; they’re going to be more bloated,' she said. Often, bloating is caused by irritable bowel syndrome, a condition that affects a staggering one in seven Britons (caused by an oversensitive gut, it leads to problems with bowel function and can trigger bloating, as well as cramps, constipation or diarrhoea). While most people’s stomachs may swell just a couple of inches, others’ can actually double in girth in just one day, only to ‘deflate’ overnight until the next attack. Other bloating triggers include chewing gum, antibiotics and stress. To read the full interview, click here. Hormonal fluctuations during a woman’s monthly cycle are a common trigger for bloating. But . while many women might put it down to ‘fluid retention’, the cause is . actually relaxed muscles, explains Leila Hanna, consultant gynaecologist . and obstetrician at BMI The Sloane Hospital, London. ‘Many women find they are bloated before their period, and this is due to an increased level of progesterone,’ she says. ‘During . ovulation, the ovaries produce more progesterone and it causes muscles . in the abdomen to relax. Everything (i.e. the organs) isn’t packed in as . tightly as usual, causing a woman to look bloated. It tends to get . worse just before the menopause.’ The . muscles in the bowel also relax, meaning they are less efficient at . moving food along the gut. This can cause constipation, triggering . further bloating. It’s possible to overcome this by eating more fibre, . says Ms Hanna.","Dr Robynne Chutkan, a U.S. gastroenterologist, says women's colons are on average 10cm longer than men's .

Police in Scotland are trialling mobile fingerprint scanners to help officers identify people on the streets more quickly. The scanners, being used for the first time in the country by officers in Aberdeen, are linked to a national database of fingerprints and police can be alerted in seconds if a suspect's prints match a record. Senior officers believe that the devices will save 'several hours' of police time by cutting out escorted journeys to stations to check identities. New technology: The first police force in Scotland is trialling the use of mobile fingerprint scanners . The devices have already been trialled in England, with several forces branding them a success, and they are currently used by more than 25 forces including the Metropolitan Police which launched them in January. West Midlands Police were able to identify about 2,200 people, including some who were wanted in connection with criminal investigations, during an initial six-month trial. If they prove a success in Aberdeen, they could be used across Scotland. Chief inspector Nick Topping said: 'It can be a considerable impact on our time to have to convey people to a police station in order to confirm their identification where there may be dubiety. Trial run: Police Scotland Chief Inspector Nick Topping issues a new mobile fingerprint scanners to an officer in Aberdeen . New weapon in fight against crime: Police officers in Aberdeen try out the new technology . 'The mobile scanners can quickly confirm this and, ultimately, free up officers to be on the streets protecting the public. 'It will also ensure that members of the public who we need to speak to in relation to our enquiries are not unnecessarily delayed in going about their own business. 'The scanners will also provide opportunities for police to detect the small minority who may attempt to pervert the course of justice by providing false details. 'There are numerous examples where these devices have been used very effectively in ensuring officers have been able to quickly conclude their enquiries and be available to provide further service within the local communities.' As well as being used to identify people stopped on the street, the technology is being used in England to identify unconscious or fatal victims of road traffic collisions and to identify murder victims. The scanners are barely bigger than the size of the average mobile phone and check prints against the Police National Computer.","Officers in Aberdeen are first in Scotland to use the mobile scanners .

The Queen's beloved corgis are fed a luxury diet of fillet steak and chicken breast cooked by a chef, a new book claims. The carefully prepared meals are then delivered by a footman and covered with gravy which is poured by the monarch herself. Royal biographer Brian Hoey claims that the dogs eat at 5pm sharp every day at Buckingham Palace, in his book Pets by Royal Appointment. The Queen's beloved corgis are fed a luxury diet of fillet steak and chicken breast cooked by a chef, a new book claims . Queen Elizabeth pictured at Aberdeen Airport with her corgis to start her holidays in Balmoral, Scotland in 1974 . They do not eat until the Queen herself has given the royal command for them to begin their meals, the Sunday Times reports. The dogs never eat tinned food and have even been given homeopathic remedies when they are ill, he said. The Queen's love of corgis was said to have been sparked on her eighteenth birthday, when she was given a Pembroke corgi named Susan from whom numerous successive dogs were bred. Some were mated with dachshunds - most notably Pipkin, who belonged to Princess Margaret - to create ‘dorgis’. The puppy was given to the Queen on her 18th birthday by King George VI, and her gravestone calls her 'the faithful companion of the Queen', an epitaph which is also used on the headstones of two of her descendants, Sugar and Heather. Susan was said to be so beloved by the Queen that she went on honeymoon with her and Prince Philip in 1947. The young Princess with two corgi dogs at her home in July 1936 . At present, The Queen owns two corgis, Willow and Holly, and two dorgis, Candy and Vulcan, which travel with her to her various residences. The most recent death in the Queen's menagerie is that of 13-year-old Monty, who starred with Her Majesty in the James Bond sketch for the Olympics opening ceremony. However, he was laid to rest at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, where he died. When at Buckingham Palace, the dogs sleep in raised wicker baskets in a special boot room near the royal apartments, where they wander freely. At Balmoral, the young Elizabeth would take the Corgis out onto the moor to help find grouse. However, although the corgis were expert at locating the shot birds in the heather, they had difficulty retrieving them. So she would watch them wind the game and then rush over to retrieve the grouse herself. The Queen thinks of the names for all the puppies at the kennels. One of her current labradors, Gryffindor, is from a litter named after Harry Potter characters.

But Prince Philip is said to 'loathe' the dogs, as they are 'too yappy' The kennels at Sandringham, established by Edward VII in 1879 to house 100 dogs, are now home to Gundogs, Labradors and Cocker Spaniels . Mr Hoey has said The Queen has a very hands on approach in all aspects of her dogs' lives. As a child she and Princess Margaret would feed their pet corgi by hand from a bowl, he said. She has also apparently joked that when breeding the dogs with dachshunds she gives them a hand by 'putting them on a brick' as they are shorter in the leg. The Royal family is well known for their love of dogs, but Mr Hoey said the Duke of Edinburgh 'loathes' corgis 'because they yap too much'. He and Prince Edward prefer labradors, and Prince Andrew is fond of Norfolk terriers. The writer also lists a few of the more unusual anImals gifted to the family by other world leaders, including an elephant from Cameroon and a baby crocodile from Gambia.

A toddler has been cured of a rare condition after having his skull broken apart and pieced back together like a jigsaw. Ethan Mair, two, from Gosport, Hampshire, was born with craniosynostosis - a condition which caused the skull to fuse before birth. While most babies are born with gaps in the skull which allow the brain to grow, Ethan’s had already fused by the time he was born. Ethan Mair (pictured with his mother, Ashlea), two, was born with craniosynostosis - a condition which causes the skull to fuse early. Without treatment, he could have developed learning difficulties and sight problems . The toddler underwent five hours of surgery - during which he lost all the blood in his body - to reshape his skull and piece it back together. Luckily, the gruelling operation was a success, and his parents have now been told that Ethan will need no further surgery. His mother, Ashlea, 24, said: ‘When I realised that Ethan’s skull would be broken apart and then pieced back together, I was shocked. ‘It was described to me as though his skull was like a jigsaw puzzle. ‘Then when he had the surgery and we were told that he’d lost so much blood from his head that he’d had a full body blood transfusion, I was horrified. ‘It was heart breaking to think what he’d been through. Ethan had a five hour operation at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital during which surgeons broke his skull and then pieced it back together like a jigsaw . Ethan (pictured after surgery) lost all of the blood in his body during his operation and had to have numerous transfusions. However, the surgery was a success and he is now recovering at home . ‘But with his skull fused together, his brain wouldn’t have been able to grow and he could have ended up with eye sight, speech or mobility problems. ‘He’s been left with a big zigzag scar across his scalp, but that’s slowly being hidden with a full head of blonde hair. He’s doing really well.’ Whilst Ms Mair, a support worker for adults with learning disabilities, never noticed a problem with her youngest child, a doctor pointed out his odd shaped head when Ethan was just four-weeks-old. Ms Mair said: ‘When the doctor mentioned his head shape I was a bit surprised. Ethan's mother, Ashlea, said: 'When I realised that Ethan's skull would be broken apart and then pieced back together, I was shocked.' Ethan is pictured two days after the surgery . Ethan (pictured before surgery) had such a minor deformation of the skull when he was diagnosed that his mother did not notice it - it was picked up by a doctor . ‘I supposed I had noticed it but I never thought anything of it. ‘Then about two weeks later he started having eye sight problems - I couldn’t get him to focus at all, it was as though he was looking right through me. ‘The doctor arranged for us to have an emergency referral and that’s when I really started to worry.’ At three-months-old Ethan was officially diagnosed with craniosynostosis. His mother said: ‘I didn’t know what it was and I’d never heard of it before. Ms Mair (pictured with Ethan and his sister, Teigan) said: 'He's been left with a big zigzag scar across his scalp, but that's slowly being hidden with a full head of blonde hair. He's doing really well' Ethan (pictured in hospital after his surgery) is not expected to need any further surgery . ‘Naturally I went online and I just scared myself. ‘I read all these horror stories, and from then on I was just a mess. ‘The thought of losing my little boy was just too awful to even think about.’ Ethan underwent his five hour surgery at John Radcliffe Hospital, in Oxford, at just over a year old. Ms Mair said: ‘His Dad had to go with him when he was put under because I just couldn’t bear it. Ms Mair said: 'I'm so proud of Ethan for being so brave and getting through everything. He's a strong little boy and I feel so lucky that he's happy and healthy now' ‘He was my precious little boy and I knew I wouldn’t be able to face seeing him slip away. ‘The five hours of waiting were a nightmare, and when he finally did come around we were told how poorly he’d been during the op. ‘I rushed to see him in the high dependency unit and just burst into tears. ‘Seeing his scar was quite a shock, it really brought home what he’d been through. Craniosynostosis is a rare problem with the skull that causes a baby to be born with, or to develop, an abnormally shaped head. This can cause headaches, learning difficulties and eye problems. These symptoms usually result from increased pressure within the skull. The problem occurs as a result of the premature fusion of the different sections of the skull. This means the skull is unable to grow in certain areas and when one area is prevented from growing, other areas may 'overgrow' to compensate. Craniosynostosis affects about one in every 1,800 to 3,000 children. Three quarters of cases are in boys. The main treatment for the condition is surgery - most children recover well after the surgery and have no further problems but some develop other problems with their skull's development as they get older. This can require further surgery to correct. Source: NHS Choices . ‘It was a few hours before I could give him a cuddle but when I did it was amazing.’ Now Ethan is back home with his mother and sister, Teigan, four. Ms Mair said: ‘I’m so proud of Ethan for being so brave and getting through everything. ‘He’s a strong little boy and I feel so lucky that he’s happy and healthy now. ‘Seeing him play with his sister with a big smile on his face is just incredible.’ Gill Ruff, the group administrator for Headlines, the craniofacial support group said: . ‘Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of the skull before birth, either in one place or in multiple places. ‘Normally when a child is born the brain is made of individual plates. If the plates have prematurely fused, the brain cannot grow. ‘The child could have brain damage, and pressure on the brain if left untreated. ‘In the UK there are four specialist units at Alder Hay Hospital in Liverpool, Birmingham Children’s Hospital, John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, and Great Ormond Street Hospital, who specialise in the treatment of craniosynostosis. ‘For children with single suture craniosynostosis, the child is usually given surgery at around a year old. ‘If this surgery is successful the child will normally face no further problems.’ For more information on craniosynostosis, visit the Headlines website www.headlines.org.uk .","Ethan Mair, two, has craniosynostosis - a rare condition which causes the skull to fuse before a baby is born meaning pressure builds up in the skull .

A U.S. military helicopter with four crew onboard has crashed at an American airbase in Japan, it was confirmed today. The HH-60 rescue helicopter crashed in a training area at Camp Hansen on the southern island of Okinawa. The U.S. Air Force said all four crew members are believed to have survived. Scroll down for video . The military helicopter crashed in a forest near a U.S. airbase in Okinawa and smoke was seen rising from the area (pictured) A U.S. Marine Corp helicopter sprays water at the site where the HH-60 helicopter crashed at Camp Hansen . Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera told reporters that three crew members ejected from the helicopter and the fourth was apparently injured and taken to hospital. Onodera said the accident was 'regrettable' and that he was asking the U.S. to provide information promptly, conduct a thorough investigation and take preventive measures. The helicopter, which belongs to Okinawa's Kadena Air Base, was on an unspecified training mission, the Air Force said in a statement. Officials said the cause of the crash is not yet known. Television footage showed smoke rising a remote mountainside forest and officials said firefighters had been dispatched to the area. Okinawa prefectural police said there were no reports of injuries among local residents. About 25,000 U.S. troops are stationed on Okinawa at bases such as the Kadena Air Base (file picture) However, the crash could add to anger over the concentration of U.S. military bases on the island. About half of the 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan are based on Okinawa under a Japan-U.S. security pact. Kadena Mayor Hiroshi Toyama said: 'We knew it was going to happen sooner or later.' Local media said the crash revived memories of an accident in 2004, when a CH-53 helicopter from Marine Corps Air Station Futenma crashed into a nearby university building, triggering a huge anti-base uproar although there were no civilian injuries and the crew survived. Many residents associate the U.S. bases with accidents, crime and pollution.","The HH-60 rescue helicopter crashed in training on the Japanese island .

Chelsea Manning has spoken out for the first time since she was sentenced to say that she is not a pacifist - after learning that a peace award had been accepted on her behalf. Manning, who was previously known as Bradley Manning, was sentenced to 35 years in prison at Fort Leavenworth in August for releasing 700,000 sensitive government documents to Wikileaks. She said that she was 'shocked and frustrated' to learn that she had been awarded the Sean MacBride Peace Award for her actions, explaining that she was in fact a 'transparency advocate'. Releasing her statement to The Guardian, she also thanked her supporters for referring to her as female after saying in August that she wanted to undergo hormone therapy to transition to a woman. Speaking out: Chelsea Manning, pictured in an undated handout from the U.S. Army, has said that she is not a pacifist after learning that she had been granted a peace award for leaking government documents . 'From my perspective at least, it's not . terribly clear to me that my actions were explicitly done for ""peace"",' she wrote in the October 7 letter. 'I . don't consider myself a ""pacifist,"" ""anti-war,"" or (especially) a ""conscientious objector"". I'm a ""transparency advocate"". 'I feel that the public cannot decide what actions and policies are or are not justified if they don't even know the most rudimentary details about them and their effects.' In the statement, Manning added that she . had been flattered to receive the award but wished to set the record . straight that there had been a 'disconnect' between public perception of . why she had carried out her actions and her real reason for carrying . them out. Old life: Manning, previously known as Bradley Manning, was sentenced to 35 years in August for the leaks . Subject: Concerns Regarding 2013 Sean MacBride Peace Award . I'm very concerned about a substantial disconnect I discovered between what I've experienced in the last few weeks, and what's occurred in the rest of the world. The most obvious disconnect has to do with the 2013 Sean MacBride Peace Award that was supposedly accepted on my behalf. Now there exists the possibility that there might be more false impressions out there in regards to how I feel about the [peace] award, how it ties to my actions in 2010, and who I am. From my perspective at least, it's not . terribly clear to me that my actions were explicitly done for ""peace"". I . don't consider myself a ""pacifist,"" ""anti-war,"" or (especially) a ""conscientious objector"". I'm a ""transparency advocate"". I feel that the public cannot . decide what actions and policies are or are not justified if they don’t . even know the most rudimentary details about them and their effects. I'd like to clarify that, as far as I'm . concerned, I no longer have any rank. And, I'd like to thank everyone . who has avoided misgendering me and switched to using my new name and . feminine pronouns. Thank you, . Chelsea Manning . For full statement, see The Guardian . The award was given to her last month by the International Peace Bureau for her 'outstanding work for peace' in 'revealing information about US war crimes'. Ann Wright, a retired U.S. Army colonel and a prominent peace activist, accepted the award on her behalf - even though Manning claims she knew nothing of it. She said that she was first aware of the award when people wrote to her in prison quoting from Wright's acceptance speech. Wright had suggested that Manning was 'overwhelmed' by the award. Manning added: 'I accept that there may be ""peaceful"" or ""anti-war"" implications . to my actions – but this is purely based on [Wright's] subjective . interpretation of the primary source documents.' Wright told the Guardian she was 'distressed' Manning felt the acceptance speech had represented her inaccurately and apologized. Manning's lawyer, . David Coombs, told the Guardian he had told his client about the prize . and that Wright would be accepting it when it was announced in July. He . suggested that Manning had possibly confused the award with another . event. In the letter, . Manning added that no future statements coming from her lawyer should be . deemed official, and only ones signed by her on letterheaded paper . should be accepted as official. At . the end of the statement, she signed as Chelsea Manning and thanked . 'everyone who has avoided misgendering me and switched to using my new . name and feminine pronouns'. Manning, who is expected to be behind bars for at least eight years, added that since the trial she has been 'trying to decompress and focus on other things after a lengthy and exhausting court-martial process'. Anger: Her issue was with the Sean MacBride Peace Award which was accepted on her behalf by Ann Wright (pictured), a retired colonel of the U.S. army. Wright apologized to Manning following the statement . The material Manning leaked in 2010 included video of a U.S. helicopter attack that killed at least two civilians - a Reuters news photographer and his driver. The former intelligence analyst was found guilty last month of 20 crimes, including six violations of the Espionage Act, as part of the Obama administration's unprecedented crackdown on media leaks. But the judge acquitted her of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy, an offense that could have meant life in prison without parole.","Manning released statement to explain she was not a pacifist after receiving a peace prize without her knowledge .

Joyce Spencer, 77, and husband Ralph, 80, were told Thursday by furloughed park rangers they had to leave their Lake Mead home because it sits on federal park land, this despite owning the home outright and Mr Spencer recovering from cancer . Instead of enjoying their golden years beside a beautiful lake, the Spencers have instead found themselves scrambling to find a place to stay, with Ms Spencer spending most days working in the family ice cream shop, according to KTNV. Displaced: Joyce Spencer and husband Ralph were forced out of their lakeside home due to the government shutdown . Forced out of a cabin they’ve lived in since the 1970’s, the two grandparents were given 24 hours to vacate, Ms Spencer told the station. The forced eviction has left Ralph Spencer, a Korean War veteran, distraught and distrusting of the government. 'He's very discouraged by it,' daughter Tisha Cook told CNN. 'Notice he's not on any camera interviews. 'He's lost his trust in everything at this point. He doesn't trust anyone. He feels like anything that he's worked and done, everything in his hard-earned life, has been stripped from him.' Explaining that her parents' lakeside home is near Las Vegas, Ms Cook said the location was ideal for her father as he received cancer treatments at a Sin City hospital. Located on Stewart’s Point, the home is on land that is part of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, which is federal parkland. The Spencers were forced to leave after officials advised ‘they could not provide services,’ she told the station. Despite the gross inconvenience, the displaced granny is taking her predicament in stride. ‘I had to go to town today and buy Ralph undershirts and jeans because I forgot his pants,’ she told the station. Upset: Tisha Cook (right) feels the government isn't being fair to her parents, that they deserve to be allowed to live in their home . Paradise lost: No longer at their lakeside home, the Spencers have been forced to live with nearby relatives . Off limits: This sign barring entry to the park was placed at the end of the road leading to the Spencers' home . Park Officials are only allowing home owners to return to retrieve belongings. ‘Unfortunately overnight stays are not permitted until a budget is passed and the park can reopen,’ officials said in a statement. Banished from their lakeside paradise, the Spencers are not staying with family – but the move did not come without its challenges. Back to work: Ms Spencer has spent her days slaving away in the family ice cream shop . ‘I had to be sure and get his walker and his scooter that he has to go in, Ms Spencer explained. 'We're not hurt in any way except it might cost me if I have to go buy more pants.’ Even so, Ms Spencer wants to go home, shutdown or otherwise, and her daughter agrees.","Joyce Spencer, 77, and husband Ralph, 80, were given 24 hours to vacate their home of about 40 years .

Sean Clode, 21, from Hartlepool, outside Teesside Crown Court, Middlesbrough where he has been convicted of sexual grooming and child abduction . A paedophile who had sex with a 14-year-old after grooming her while she played computer games has been found guilty of sexual grooming and child abduction. Sean Clode, 21, started speaking to the teenager after befriending her while the pair played computer games. Clode, from Hartlepool, County Durham spend the night with the child in a tent on the beach after she travelled hundreds of miles from her home in Scotland to meet him. Teesside Crown Court heard that her frantic father drove through the night to try and find his teenage daughter. In a statement, he said: ‘As I got to Hartlepool, it was first light and I spent an hour walking around the docks. 'Then, beside myself with worry, I attended Hartlepool police station.’ ‘During my frantic attempts to locate my daughter, I walked along the coastline, knocked on doors and spoke to postmen.’ He was informed that a police helicopter found her at around 2pm. He said: ‘I was becoming increasingly concerned I wouldn’t see (her) alive again. 'No words can explain how traumatic and upsetting this whole experience has been for me and my family.’ Footage from a police helicopter showed Clode, 21, leaving the tent while the girl pulled her dress down. The next day she told police they had sex several times, but retracted the claim the following month. The prosecution claimed she altered her account out of ‘misplaced loyalty’ or embarrassment. Clode denied all offences and said the girl arrived in Hartlepool without his knowledge. He claimed he decided to take her to the beach as 'it would look bad' for him to take her home. The 21-year-old told the jury the pair were fully clothed at all times and insisted they did not have sex. ‘I never groomed that lass, I was just helping her,' he said. The jury deliberated for just over an hour before convicting him of sexual grooming, child abduction and two counts of sexual activity with a child. The abduction charge relates to his removing the girl from the lawful authority of her parents. Clode was remanded in custody and will be sentenced in two weeks’ time, but was warned by Judge Howard Crownson that jail was inevitable.","Sean Clode, 21, befriended 14-year-old girl while playing Xbox games .

The United States is leaning toward withholding most military aid to Egypt except to promote counterterrorism, security in the Sinai Peninsula that borders Israel, and other such priorities, a U.S. official said today. The official said U.S. President Barack Obama had not made a final decision on the issue, which has vexed U.S. officials as they balance a desire to be seen promoting democracy and rights with a desire to keep up some cooperation with Egypt's military. The military on July 3 overthrew President Mohamed Morsi, who emerged from Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood movement to become the country's first freely elected president last year after the February 2011 fall of longtime authoritarian ruler Hosni Mubarak. Anger: Cairo university students and members of the Muslim Brotherhood shout slogans against the military in front of Cairo University in Cairo . Protests: Cairo university students and members of the Muslim Brotherhood carry a banner with the four-fingered symbol of Rabaa, representing the six-week sit-in in Cairo that was disbanded by the military on August 14 . Devastated: Egyptian government employees clean up outside the Rabaah al-Adawiya mosque, where supporters of Egypt's ousted President Mohammed Morsi had a protest camp in Nasr City in August . Morsi supporters and security forces have repeatedly clashed since, including on Sunday, one of the bloodiest days since the military took power, with state media reporting 57 people dead. After Morsi's ouster, the Obama administration said it would suspend about $585 million (364 million pounds) in military assistance to Egypt pending a wider policy review. The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Obama administration was now leaning toward continuing to withhold most of that, with the exceptions described above. The official said the United States was also leaning toward continuing some economic aid to Egypt, but chiefly funds that go to nongovernmental groups rather than to the government itself. A second U.S. official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said a decision on the aid was likely to be made public by the end of the week, although he noted that an announcement has been repeatedly postponed. Future: The official said U.S. President Barack Obama had not made a final decision on the issue . Egypt for decades has been among the largest recipients of U.S. military and economic aid because of its 1979 peace treaty with U.S. ally Israel, which agreed to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula it seized from Egypt in 1967 as a result of the pact. The United States has long provided Egypt with about $1.55 billion in annual aid, including $1.3 billion in military assistance. The removal of Morsi has left Obama with an acute dilemma: whether to get tough with the army for toppling a democratically elected president, albeit an Islamist who had few friends in Washington, or whether to acquiesce in his overthrow. U.S. officials have said there has been a sharp debate within the administration for months over the issue, with one saying that the Pentagon had argued for continuing military aid, while others urged a significant reduction. At the U.N. General Assembly on September 24, Obama appeared to split the difference, saying the United States would maintain constructive ties with Egypt's interim government despite its anti-democratic moves - including an emergency law and restrictions on opposition parties, the media and civil society. He also suggested that some military aid would depend on the interim government embracing a more inclusive democracy. Meeting: Jordanian King Abdullah II (left) and Egyptian interim President Adli Mansour (right) review honor guards at AL-Hummer Royal offices, in Amman, Jordan . Trip: Mansour arrived from Saudi Arabia as part of his first overseas tour since he replaced deposed Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in early July . 'Going forward, the United States will maintain a constructive relationship with the interim government that promotes core interests like the Camp David Accords and counterterrorism,' he said, referring to the U.S.-brokered agreements that led to the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. 'We'll continue support in areas like education that directly benefit the Egyptian people,' he added. 'But we have not proceeded with the delivery of certain military systems, and our support will depend upon Egypt's progress in pursuing a more democratic path.' Earlier on Tuesday, CNN quoted a U.S. official as saying that an 'accumulation of events,' including the recent violence, had led to the decision on a 'full suspension' of aid, a report the White House denied. 'The reports that we are halting all military assistance to Egypt are false,' Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said in a statement. ""We will announce the future of our assistance relationship with Egypt in the coming days, but as the president made clear at (the U.N. General Assembly), that assistance relationship will continue."" The Pentagon declined all comment. Ominous: Bloodstains are seen on the ground in Ramsis street, in downtown Cairo following clashes between Egyptian riot police and Muslim Brotherhood supporters at the weekend. It is unclear who the flip flops belonged to and whether they lived or died . Bloody: The attack comes after dozens died last weekend in clashes involving security forces, supporters of Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood and their opponents . Hospital: In a separate incident, an explosion near a state security building in South Sinai killed two people and injured 48, medical sources said. A witness said the explosion was caused by a car bomb . Vanessa Murray, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Defence Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees foreign military aid and sales, earlier told Reuters there had been no change in policy or status regarding Egypt. Officials at General Dynamics Corp, which makes M1A1 tank kits for Egypt, and Boeing Co, which is building Apache helicopters for the Arab country, said late on Tuesday they had not been notified of any decision to halt military aid. There was no immediate comment from Lockheed Martin Corp, which is building F-16 fighter jets for Egypt. Shipments of four F-16s have already been halted temporarily, and eight more jets were due to be delivered in December. Two former government officials familiar with foreign military sales have said the Obama administration is likely to curtail certain high-visibility weapons sales such as the 12 Lockheed Martin Corp F-16s due to be delivered to Egypt this year to send a message to the military. The planes could be fairly easily adapted for sale to other countries, they said.","Official said President Obama had not made a final decision on the issue .

One month in: Ms Morgan, who had a gastric bypass in September 2012, drops a stone in just a month . Noticeable results: The mother manages to maintain losing 14lbs every four weeks over the festive period . Callum, who has extensive brain damage, is unable to walk, talk, or feed himself after he was starved of oxygen at birth. Ms Morgan, from Basildon, Essex, was spurred into action last year when she visited the doctors for a check up - and they said because of her weight she would die before Callum was a teenager. The mother secured a gastric bypass on the NHS and the weight has dropped off her at the rate of about a stone-a-month. Dropping pounds: The former trainee nurse weighs under 25 stone in February of this year . Fitting: Ms Morgan, from Basildon, wears the same top as she did in November - which now hangs off her . Looking good: The mother-of two, who was spurred into losing weight for her disabled son Callum, looks thrilled with the results after six months and now weighs around 22 stone . She once became stuck in size 32 jeans but now weighs a healthier 15 stone and has shrunk to a 16 dress size. Today, Ms Morgan said: 'I was terrified that I would die and leave my boys without a mum. 'Callum can't eat, he can't walk, he can't talk but he's still very naughty and cheeky in his own way. 'My boys are everything to me. They are hard work but they give me so much back. New lifestyle: Ms Morgan, who would gorge on packs of biscuits, shows off her figure in a summery top . Much slimmer: Now under 20 stone, the mother is half the woman she was . Home straight: Ms Morgan who weighs around 17 stone in this image is totally transformed . 'I'm grateful I can live to see them grow up now.' Ms Morgan's weight first began to creep up when she suffered relentless bullying at school. She binged on fast food such as KFC and McDonalds and hit 20 stone by the time she was 18. She piled on more pounds when Connor was born and her weight gain accelerated when Callum suffered birth complications. After Callum was born, she was forced to give up her career as a trainee nurse to become a full-time carer for her son. Goal weight: The mother, wearing her old size 32 trousers above, is now a healthier 15 stone and a size 16 . Calorific dinners such as pie and chips plus fast food binges of McDonalds or KFC . Daily Chinese and Indian takeaways . Trips to Starbucks would see her gorge on full-fat lattes plus a chocolate muffin . Salads, always served with a low-fat  dressing . Dinners of marinated chicken breast with steamed vegetables plus fruit . Trips to Starbucks are minus the muffin and the latte is now with skimmed milk . Ms Morgan, who was also developing symptoms of sleep apnoea - interrupted breathing when asleep - because of her size, underwent the gastric bypass in September last year. Surgeons attached the top section of her stomach directly to her small intestine, bypassing most of the stomach and her bowels. Since then the mother has not been able to eat more than a starter-sized portion of food. She added: 'I go to KFC with the boys now and I'll feel ill after one drumstick because of the grease. 'If I'd kept going the way I was then I would have been dead within five years.' Ms . Morgan says she has now changed her diet - and no longer eats sugary sweats or chocolate and limits the amount of carbohydrates she consumes. Incentive: Ms Morgan, pictured left at her heaviest with her son Callum and after her transformation right, says she's grateful she will now be able to look after her two sons . The mother said: 'You can't just have the bypass and leave it all to happen. You have to watch what you eat. 'My body will even itself out eventually and there are some foods now that I just can't tolerate. 'I can't eat bread now and I don't eat sweets or chocolate at all. 'I had even got stomach ulcers because of the reaction of some of the unhealthier foods at the beginning.'","Jane Morgan, 38, from Basildon, Essex, weighed 28 stone at her heaviest .

The Princess Royal at the event. The centre will help patients with MS and other neurological diseases by looking to find treatments to slow their progression. JK Rowling today opened The Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic at Edinburgh University . The centre - to which JK Rowling donated £10m - will deal with conditions such as multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease, as well as autism and early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Speaking in a statement Ms Rowling, who wore a flattering red dress and dazzling jewellery, said: 'I . am moved and elated to see the Anne Rowling Clinic formally opened today . by HRH The Princess Royal. 'Having . observed the plans for the clinic develop and expand to fulfil the . needs of patients, clinicians and researchers, I am now very proud to . see the building finished and operating as the beating heart of this . centre for excellence. 'Thank you to everyone who has been involved in its creation and operation.' The best-selling author was supported by The Princess Royal, who is Chancellor of Edinburgh University. The Royal, who wore a smart brown suit, was given a tour of the clinic while . both staff and students demonstrated the facilities and told her about . current research projects at the University. The Princess Royal, in her role as chancellor of the university, unveiled a plaque to mark the occasion and paid tribute to the 'exceptional support' Rowling has given to this field of research. Anne told the gathering: 'It’s always a pleasure to see developments happening because this is a particular area of interest, as far as I’m concerned. The facility, which was established with a £10 million donation from the Harry Potter author JK Rowling, was opened by Princess Anne . The multiple sclerosis research clinic is named after her late mother, who she tragically lost to the disease . 'To be able to come (to the . university) every now and again and really see what I consider to be . step changes happening in an area which I think, to a degree, has been . slightly below the horizon in the past is a huge encouragement. 'It’s . a huge encouragement for people like us but I hope it’s more . encouraging to those who are patients now, for whom it is very much part . of their work. It’s their involvement which is making those step . changes possible.' She added: 'None of this happens . without support and to have the exceptional support that we’ve had from . Jo Rowling is quite astonishing. 'We’ve got to make the best use of that and I hope she will make sure that we do that.' When . Rowling’s donation was announced three years ago, the writer said she . believed the clinic would become a world centre for excellence in its . field. She said in 2010: 'I . have supported research into the cause and treatment of multiple . sclerosis for many years now, but when I first saw the proposal for this . clinic, I knew that I had found a project more exciting, more . innovative, and, I believe, more likely to succeed in unravelling the . mysteries of MS than any other I had read about or been asked to fund.'

"By . Lizzie Parry . PUBLISHED: . 04:35 EST, 9 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:40 EST, 9 October 2013 . As the US government shutdown enters its ninth day the closure is threatening to leave America’s craft brewers nursing a serious hangover. While stores across the country will continue to stock a range of beers and ales on their shelves, the shutdown has closed an obscure agency, which quietly approves new breweries, recipes and labels. Its closure could halt the rapidly growing craft industry in its tracks, creating huge delays for customers who expect a constant supply of inventive and seasonal beers. Scroll down for video . At risk: Mike Brenner, owner of Brenner Brewing in Milwaukee, said the US government shutdown could halt his plans to open a new craft brewery in December. He claims the federal closure will cost him $8,000 a month . The federal government shutdown began on October 1 after a group of House Republican lawmakers blocked a budget deal in a last-ditch effort to stop funding for President Barack Obama’s health care law. Mike Brenner is trying to open a craft brewery in Milwaukee in December. His application to include a tasting room is now on hold, as are his plans to file paperwork for four new labels over the coming weeks. He risks losing around $8,000 for every month his opening is delayed. ‘My dream, this is six years in the making, is to open this brewery,’ he said. ‘I've been working so hard, and I find all these great investors. And now I can't get started because people are fighting over this or that in Washington. ‘This is something people don't mess around with. Even in a bad economy, people drink beer.’ He said politicians do not seem to care how much damage they are causing. ‘For them it’s just another day,' he added. 'They are still getting paid, but I’m losing $8,000 a month.’ Shut: The closure of The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau means Mr Brenner's application to open his new brewery, to include a tasting room, is now on hold as are plans to file paperwork for four new brews . Concerned: Matt Krajnak, spokesman for Lakefront Brewery in Milwaukee, said: 'Right now, it's only been a week so it's not too bad. Two weeks, three weeks is when we're really going to start sweating here.' The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is a little-known arm of the Treasury Department. While the agency will continue to process taxes from existing permit holders during the shutdown, applications for anything new are in limbo. What will happen during the shutdown? All non-essential government services close and their staff are put on unpaid leave. More than 80 per cent of staff at bodies such as Nasa and the Environmental Protection Agency will be 'furloughed', but courts, the military and veterans' affairs will remain functioning almost as normal. National parks and government-funded museums such as the Smithsonian will be closed. Social Security pension payments and the 'Obamacare' health reforms will not be affected, because they are funded separately. What is the economic effect?The shutdown is predicted to cost the American economy more than $1billion a day, according to Goldman Sachs, thanks to the drop in output caused by federal workers staying at home, and the loss of tourism.Why should people outside the U.S. care?Visa applications are expected to be delayed because consulate staff will not be paid, while officials currently involved in international trade negotiations will have to break off from talks. Stock markets around the world fell on news of the shutdown. Even more worryingly, the deadlock in Washington makes it less likely that politicians will be able to strike a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling later this month - if the world's biggest economy is forced to default on its debts, the world could be plunged into the worst economic crisis since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Paul Gatza, director of the Brewers Association, which represents more than 1,900 US breweries, said: ‘One could think of this shutdown as basically stopping business indefinitely for anyone who didn't have certain paperwork in place back in mid-August.’ A woman who answered the phone on October 2 at TTB’s headquarters in Washington abruptly hung up on Associated Press after explaining the government was shutdown. Assistant Administrator Cheri Mitchell did not respond to telephone or email messages. A message on the bureau’s website warns: ‘Due to the government shutdown, information on this website is available, but may not be up to date.' The closing is not expected to have much effect on America’s industry giants, including MillerCoors and Anheuser-Busch, who can continue to produce existing products as normal. But the shutdown poses a huge problem for smaller, craft brewers who build their business by producing quirky, unusual flavours and introducing new seasonal beers. Prior to the shutdown craft brewers claim the TTB was taking up to 75 days to approve applications. Now they are bracing themselves for longer delays. The impact has provoked anger among smaller producers. Tony Magee, owner of Lagunitas Brewing Co. in Petaluma, near San Francisco in California took to Twitter to air his annoyance. ‘(Expletive) Feds are gonna shut down the already incompetent Gov while hundreds of small breweries, including us, have labels pending. Nice.’ That was followed by: ‘Wanna regulate? Perform or get out of the way.’ Lagunitas Chief Operating Officer Todd Stevenson called the TTB shutdown a ‘headache’. He said the company was planning to submit an application to package its autumn seasonal Hairy Eyeball in 22-ounce bottles instead of 12-ounce bottles but can't move forward. ‘It's just aggravating,’ he said. ‘It is frustrating that government can't do its job. Doing what they're doing now is unprecedented.’ Bryan Simpson, a spokesman for New Belgium Brewing in Fort Collins, Colo., said his brewery has three recipes and five new labels awaiting approval. The company is especially worried that the release of its new spring label, Spring Blonde, could get pushed back. More delays might force New Belgium to shell out extra money to speed up the label printing and rush the beer to market, he said. Mr Simpson said: ‘Everybody is frustrated in general. The whole way this has played out has been disappointing for the entire country.’ Lakefront Brewery in Milwaukee has applications pending for new packaging of its IBA dark ale and for permission to offer a sour cherry dark lager called John, a brewery employee's own concoction. The brewery hopes to launch the IBA packaging in November and John in December, but plans are on hold. ‘If the shutdown causes delays, the brewery will probably have to rush the beers to market,’ he said. ‘If we lose that first month, we lose out on a good chunk of money,’ brewery spokesman Matt Karjnak said. ‘Right now, it’s only been a week so it’s not too bad. ‘Two weeks, three weeks is when we’re really going to start sweating here.’ President Barack Obama is locked in a budget battle with the Republicans . The shutdown of the US government began on October 1 after the two houses of Congress failed to agree a new budget. President Barack Obama is locked in a battle with the Republicans, who insisted they would not pass a bill to fund the government unless Democrats agreed to delay the President’s signature healthcare reforms by a year. The White House ordered non-essential services to stop operating shortly before midnight local time on October 1 - the first shutdown for more than 17 years. The US Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, refused to negotiate with the Republican-dominated House of Representatives over ‘Obamacare’, which requires every American to buy health insurance or pay a fine. The lack of compromise means that nearly a million federal workers are on unpaid leave until the two legislative bodies come to an agreement. On Tuesday President Obama opened a new chapter in the shutdown stand-off by announcing the Democrats are ‘willing to pass, at least, a short-term budget’. But he added he won’t bargain, negotiate or otherwise strike a deal on extending America’s $16.7trillion debt ceiling. Hours later, House Speaker John Boehner said that Obama's offer won't do. 'The long and short of it is: There's going to be a negotiation here,' Boehner said, referring to the more daunting debt limit fight. 'We can't raise the debt ceiling without doing something about what's driving us to borrow more money and to live beyond our means. The idea that we should continue to spend money that we don't have, and give the bill to our kids and our grandkids would be wrong.' Obama had insisted that he would force Republicans to negotiate with him in good faith, but only on the budget. 'I think what has changed,' he told reporters, 'is they're aware of the fact that I'm not budging when it comes to the full faith and credit of the United States, that that has to be dealt with.' The president said he was open to a second sit-down meeting with House and Senate leaders. 'I'll even spring for dinner again,' he said. 'But I'm not going to do it until the more extreme parts of the Republican party stop forcing John Boehner to issue threats about our economy. We can't make extortion routine as part of our democracy.' Boehner, however, dismissed Obama's terms. 'The president's position that, ""Listen, we're not going to sit down and talk to you until you surrender"" is just not sustainable,' the Ohio Republican said. 'It's not our system of government.'","US federal shutdown closes agency responsible for alcohol licensing .

MI5’s scathing criticisms of The Guardian newspaper were underplayed by the BBC, it was claimed last night. The corporation’s flagship current affairs show Newsnight, which is edited by former Guardian executive Ian Katz, failed to report spy chief Andrew Parker’s speech on Tuesday. Other BBC reports, including the News at Ten, online articles and radio bulletins, referred to his speech but made no mention of his key claim that the Left-leaning newspaper had done ‘enormous damage’. Tory MP Conor Burns, who sits on the culture, media and sport committee, said: ‘It is extraordinary that the biggest security story for a generation wasn’t deemed worthy of comment by the BBC’s leading investigative news programme. ‘There seems to be a clear conflict of interest when its editor has so recently taken the Guardian’s  shilling. The whole tone of the BBC’s coverage of this issue seems to indicate clear editorial bias. ‘They appear to be protecting their Left-wing friends’. The BBC did not change its online coverage to reflect the row until Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger publicly defended his newspaper yesterday. He appeared on Radio 4’s World at One programme, where he was largely unchallenged, to say his paper’s coverage had prompted ‘necessary debate’. Only then did the BBC update its online news articles to reflect the Guardian’s critical role in the leaks with the headline, ‘Guardian to publish more Snowden intelligence revelations’. Before joining Newsnight last month, Mr Katz worked for the Guardian for 23 years and served as its deputy editor. Mr Parker made his speech at the Royal United Services Institute in Whitehall on Tuesday. His unambiguous warnings about ‘terrorists’ contrasted with the BBC’s reluctance to use the word in its reports. The corporation was criticised during its coverage of the recent Kenyan massacre for describing the perpetrators as ‘militants’. Debate: Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger. The BBC ignored the MI% chief's criticism of the paper . The Mail's coverage of Andrew Parker's speech . Although the speech was covered by the BBC’s News at Ten on Tuesday, it ignored Mr Parker’s criticisms of the Guardian. Instead, reporter Gordon Corera chose to focus on Mr Parker’s general warnings that the security of the UK was under threat and made no reference to the newspaper. At 10.30pm, Newsnight chose to ignore the subject. Surprisingly, the current affairs show did find time to screen an interview with Jimmy Choo founder Tamara Mellon. Fury: The spy chief: MI5 director-general Andrew Parker has blasted the Guardian's publication of Britain's espionage capabilities . Online, the BBC news website’s main article on Mr Parker’s speech – written by security correspondent Frank Gardner – also glossed over Mr Parker’s criticisms. Entitled ‘MI5 chief Andrew Parker warns of Islamist threat to UK’, it made only a passing reference to the role of the Guardian in the affair. The following morning, news bulletins on BBC Radio 4 failed to mention the newspaper at all. Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘The Guardian is being accused of putting the safety of the public in danger, but the BBC has done virtually nothing to inform its own licence fee payers about it. ‘The behaviour and the regulation of the Press is once again in the public eye, but the BBC is in danger of presenting a very partial and distorted view of the behaviour of newspapers.’ A BBC spokesman said the fact Mr Katz used to work for the Guardian had ‘absolutely no bearing’ on his editorial judgment. He added: ‘Newsnight didn’t cover the story on Tuesday because it was covered thoroughly on the News at Ten and we didn’t feel we could add significantly to that coverage, and because Newsnight devoted 30 minutes to a report, interview and debate about many of the same issues last week. ‘This is an on-going story which BBC News has covered as it developed, including the criticisms from Andrew Parker, and we will continue to cover it.’","BBC downplays MI5 chief's scathing condemnation of The Guardian .

The U.S. government shut down nearly all services this morning after Congress failed to strike a deal to fund public spending before the deadline expired at midnight. Barack Obama has been locked in battle with the Republicans, who insisted that they would not pass a bill to fund the government unless Democrats agreed to delay the President's signature healthcare reforms by a year. The White House ordered non-essential services to stop operating shortly before midnight local time (5am BST), the first shutdown for more than 17 years. Scroll down for video . Clash: Republican speaker of the House John Boehner, left, has been locked in battle with Barack Obama . Empty: The federal government will be forced to furlough between 800,000 and a million workers, leaving the halls of Washington much emptier in the coming days (including the Capitol Rotunda, pictured) Prime Minister David Cameron said the situation should serve as a warning to Britain. 'It is a reminder to all of us that we need to have properly planned public expenditure systems, properly planned tax, properly planned arrangements for getting our deficit down,” Mr Cameron said at the Conservative conference in Manchester. 'It is a risk to the world economy if the U.S. can’t properly sort out its spending plans.' The U.S. Senate, which is controlled by . Democrats, refused to negotiate with the Republican-dominated House of . Representatives over 'Obamacare', which requires every American to buy . health insurance or pay a fine. This . lack of compromise means that nearly a million federal workers will go . on unpaid leave until the two legislative bodies come to an agreement. Critical . functions such as air traffic control and military operations will . continue, while the elderly will still receive Social Security pension . payments. Too late: The funding for the federal government ended at midnight on Monday when the 2013 fiscal year came to a close . On guard: Like all other departments of the federal government, the White House will be operating with a smaller staff than usual during the shutdown . What will happen during the shutdown?All non-essential government services will close and their staff put on unpaid leave. More than 80 per cent of staff at bodies such as Nasa and the Environmental Protection Agency will be 'furloughed', but courts, the military and veterans' affairs will remain functioning almost as normal. National parks and government-funded museums such as the Smithsonian will be closed. Social Security pension payments and the 'Obamacare' health reforms will not be affected, because they are funded separately. What happens next?Democrats and Republicans will return to the negotiating table - but since neither side has been willing to compromise so far, it is hard to predict when they will reach an agreement. The White House insists it will not accept any delay to the implementation of Obamacare, the President's main legislative achievement, which tea party Republicans virulently oppose. The last shutdown, in 1996, lasted 21 days - this one could be much shorter, or it could be even longer. What is the economic effect?The shutdown is predicted to cost the American economy more than $1billion a day, according to Goldman Sachs, thanks to the drop in output caused by federal workers staying at home, and the loss of tourism. Why should people outside the U.S. care?Visa applications are expected to be delayed because consulate staff will not be paid, while officials currently involved in international trade negotiations will have to break off from talks. Stock markets around the world fell on news of the shutdown. Even more worryingly, the deadlock in Washington makes it less likely that politicians will be able to strike a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling later this month - if the world's biggest economy is forced to default on its debts, the world could be plunged into the worst economic crisis since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. However, . national parks will be closed to visitors, most federal offices will . shut, and even the White House will be reduced to a skeleton staff. The . federal government has shut down a number of times before, most . recently under Bill Clinton in 1996, but this incident is considered . more serious because of the hyper-partisan atmosphere of Washington . today, as well as the forthcoming fight over raising the debt ceiling to . allow the U.S. to borrow more money. Democrats . claim that the shutdown is entirely the fault of the Republicans for . refusing to accept the validity of Obamacare despite the President's . re-election last year, but Republicans say the Democrats failed to . negotiate with them. Stock markets fell yesterday on fears that the two sides would fail to reach agreement, and further losses are expected today. Mr . Obama this morning told members of the military in a video message that . he would work to get Congress to re-open the government as soon as . possible. The President . said troops in uniform would remain on duty as usual. He said he had . signed a law ensuring troops get paid on time. He . said ongoing operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere would continue and . the U.S. would ensure those in harm's way would have what they need. As . Congress reached deadlock, Mr Obama said a 'shutdown will have a very . real economic impact on real people, right away,' with hundreds of . thousands of federal workers facing enforced absences and veterans' centres, national parks, most of Nasa and other government operations . shuttered. He laid the . blame at the feet of House Republicans, whom he accused of seeking to . tie government funding to ideological demands, 'all to save face after . making some impossible promises to the extreme right wing of their . party'. House Speaker . John Boehner responded a short while later on the House floor. 'The . American people don't want a shutdown and neither do I,' he said. Yet, . he added, the new health care law 'is having a devastating impact... Something has to be done'. The . stock market dropped on fears that political gridlock between the White . House and a Republican Party influenced by hardcore conservative tea . party lawmakers would prevail, though analysts suggested significant . damage to the national economy was unlikely unless a shutdown lasted . more than a few days. Faced with a government shutdown whose political implications are far from certain, Obama recorded a video message for U.S. military personnel in which he avoided blaming the GOP, saying only that 'Congress has not fulfilled its responsibility' The 1995-1996 federal government shutdown lasted a total of 28 days but left few economic scars as GDP growth skyrocketed after the government reopened. Republicans are hoping the public remembers that the result wasn't as apocalyptic as some had feared . A . few minutes before midnight, White House Budget Director Sylvia Burwell . issued a directive to federal agencies to 'execute plans for an orderly . shutdown'. The State . Department will continue processing foreign applications for visas, and . embassies and consulates overseas will continue to provide services to . American citizens. Any . interruption in federal funding would send divided government into . territory unexplored in nearly two decades.

'We can't win,' said Senator John McCain, the 2008 . Republican presidential candidate. Tourists in the U.S., whether they are American or not, are likely to be seriously affected by the government shutdown. National parks such as Yellowstone and Yosemite will be closed for as long as the shutdown continues, with anyone staying in campsites or on-site hotels forced to leave within two days. World-famous attractions such as the Statue of Liberty, Philadelphia's Independence Hall and the Smithsonian Institute will also be closed to visitors until funding is restored. Even American military cemeteries outside the U.S. will be closed, as their operation is funded by the federal government. Airports are expected to run as normal, as immigration, security and air traffic control are all considered to be essential services which continue to run no matter what. Passport offices are supposed to stay open, but some are located within federal buildings which are otherwise closed. Visa applications could also be affected, but the State Department claims that as consular services are self-funding they will be able to continue.

House Republicans countered with a . second despite unmistakable signs their unity was fraying - and Senate . Democrats promptly rejected it, as well. Defiant . still, House Republicans decided to re-pass their earlier measure and . simultaneously request negotiations with the Senate on a compromise. Some aides conceded the move was largely designed to make sure that the . formal paperwork was on the Senate's doorstep as the day ended. Whatever . its intent, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rejected it. 'That closes . government. They want to close government,' he said of House . Republicans. As . lawmakers squabbled, Mr Obama spoke bluntly about House Republicans. 'You don't get to extract a ransom for doing your job, for doing what . you're supposed to be doing anyway, or just because there's a law there . that you don't like,' he said. Speaking . of the health care law that undergoes a major expansion on Tuesday, he . said emphatically: 'That funding is already in place. You can't shut it . down.'

The owner of the scandal-hit Godolphin stable has ordered a new investigation after banned equine drugs were discovered on a Dubai government private jet when it was searched at Stansted airport. Officers from the UK Border Agency, along with the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, seized the unlicensed products from a Dubai Royal Air Wing flight earlier this year, it has been reported. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, monarch of the gulf emirate, has now ordered his junior wife Her Highness Princess Haya, president of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports, to carry out an investigation into the incident. The inquiry comes just weeks after a separate raid at Moorley Farm in Newmarket, which is owned by Godolphin’s Darley Management operation. According to The Guardian, the shipment, apparently labelled as 'horse tack', did not include anabolic steroids. It is believed the seizure did however contain products used on endurance horses. A spokesman for Princess Haya told the Guardian: 'Nobody seems to know in the organisation who is buying what or where. That’s one of the reforms that they want in place.' The spokesman said Sheik Mohammed had been unaware of the products on the flight as well as the raid at Moorley Farm. The spokesman also said Sheikh Mohammed's operation had not been spoken to by the VMD since the seizure and blamed the presence of the drugs on 'an internal reporting error'. Sheikh Mohammed's senior wife is Shaikha Hind bint Maktoum bin Juma Al Maktoum, a member of Dubai's ruling family Al Maktoum, who he married in 1979. His most famous junior wife is Princess Haya, who he married on April 10, 2004.

Britain. 'On account of our existing working . relationship with Defra and the VMD, as fellow regulatory authorities . with responsibilities for animals and their welfare, the BHA was . notified of the seizure of veterinary care products, some of which are . not licensed for use in the UK. 'Defra . have confirmed to the BHA that they consider there to be no link . between the seizure and the racing industry and that the products were . not intended for use on thoroughbreds.' A Border Force spokesman said the products seized at Stansted have now been destroyed.

Hard as it is to believe, Chicago's deep dish and New York's thin and crispy were hardly in the running. Tony’s Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood came a close second having held the title for a number of years. Tasty: Zagat, the exclusive guide of restaurant reviews and nightlife ratings, has rated Michael?s Pizzeria, located on Naples Island in Long Beach, as having the top pizza in the country . Hungry? The review guide included the input of thousands of customers in a point system in making their decision . 'What an honor,' said Michael Dene, owner of Michael’s Restaurant Group. 'We opened a little more than two years ago, and for the second year in a row, we have been named the Best Pizzeria in Los Angeles and we managed to top that by being named the Best Pizzeria in the United States. It’s very humbling.' But give New York some credit where it is due. Mr Dene grew up there and after moving to L.A. felt he needed to recreate a little bit of home on the West Coast. 'Michael’s Pizzeria was born out of necessity. I wanted realItalian pizza, not the take-out, cardboard variety we’re accustomed to eating in the United States.' Michael claims he wanted pizza as it was meant to be. He wanted a pie with paper-thin crust, whose edges bubbled up into soft, crisp pockets of salty air, with sauce so flavorful it could stand as a topping all on its own and cheese so fresh it had to be made by hand each morning.

A number of restaurants have led the way including Pizzeria Mozza, Stella Barra, 800 Degrees and Settebello, but even these pizzerias are not in at the top of Zagat's most recent surveys. The restaurant's website states their raison d'etre: 'We know that pizza tastes best when it is wood-fired, that mozzarella should always be freshly made, and that meals are enhanced when paired with the perfect Italian wines. From our service to our atmosphere, our flour to our sauce, this is our tradition-passed down from generation to generation-of Napoli-style pizza. At Michael's Pizzeria, food is heritage.'

A father-of-three has told how a rare disease has left his entire body covered in hundreds of tiny balls of fat. Carl Hallam, 31, has been through 10 operations in the last seven years to remove the painful lumps of tissue which erupt just under his skin. The former barman is one of only 22 people in Britain who suffer from the incurable condition Adiposis Dolorosa - also known as Dercum’s disease. Carl Hallam, 31, is one of only 22 people in Britain who suffer from the incurable condition Adiposis Dolorosa - also known as Dercum's disease . It causes fatty sacks - some as big and hard as golf balls - to appear all over Mr Hallam’s chest, arms and back. He says the disease could cause him to be wheelchair-bound before he is 40 and could even be fatal if the hard pieces of tissue move to a vital organ or block an artery. Mr Hallam, from Nottingham, said: ‘In the past 11 years I’ve had 275 appear all over the body. ‘They stay until they are removed. Basically it’s like grey hairs - you take one out and two pop up. ‘I’ve always tried to put it behind me and carry on working and I never tell anyone about it - they are all over my chest and my arms and my back as well. ‘It’s a real struggle to get work - it’s difficult to stand up for long periods of time. Mr Hallam has been through 10 operations in the last seven years to remove the painful lumps of tissue which erupt just under his skin . ‘There are only 22 people in the UK who have got it and I think it’s the third rarest disease in the world. ‘There’s no cure at all and I just want to raise awareness. ‘Obviously there are people out there going through it and I wouldn’t wish the pain on anybody - not even my worst enemy. ‘I try to keep a brave face whenever I am walking about but deep inside I am in pain and I don’t like to show it. I am male and that’s how we are. Mr Hallam, pictured with his wife, Joanne, has the lumps over his arms, chest and back. The disease could eventually prove fatal if hard tissue blocks an artery or moves to a vital organ . ‘It does have a massive impact on my life. There’s between 75 and 100 on my back down my spine. ‘If they move to a vital organ or an artery it is definitely fatal. And the probability for me, with having so many, is that there’s a good chance that could happen.’ Married Mr Hallam believes the worst thing about the disease is the effect it has on his family and working life - even causing him to struggle to hold down a job. It has also affected his body and he says meant he has gained five stone in the last five years. He added: ‘It does really affect my family life - I can be sitting in the front room and the children need to be seen to but I can’t get up and do the things they need me to do. Mr Hallam said: 'In the past 11 years I've had 275 appear all over the body. They stay until they are removed. Basically it's like grey hairs - you take one out and two pop up' ‘I have to take more tablets and wait until they kick in and do it to the best of my ability - I can’t do any more. I can’t even go the gym. ‘The lumps can make you overweight and I used to go quite a lot but if I try and lose the weight the scars and the lumps will be even more visible. ‘At the moment I am on Tramadol - a morphine based drug - that’s the only thing they can do. ‘It’s chronic pain, it takes me 20 minutes to get out of bed in the morning because I’m so stiff. ‘I’m on anti-depressants too - so it’s not ideal because I’ve got three children and I can be a bit spaced out and I just want to play with my children and be a happy family. Mr Hallam believes the worst thing about the disease is the effect it has on his family and working life . ‘As I’m getting older the pain is more and more horrible.’ Mr Hallam’s wife, Joanne, 28, said the disease can make her husband incredibly difficult to live with. She said: ‘It’s hard and I just have to leave him to deal with it, I can only give him painkillers and support him. When he’s in pain he can be clumsy and drops everything. ‘It’s hard with the kids because he can’t play - he can’t do that. Sometimes I have to double as mum and dad. Mrs Hallam said: 'It's hard and I just have to leave him to deal with it, I can only give him painkillers and support him. When he's in pain he can be clumsy and drops everything' ‘The majority of his lumps are round his chest and it’s a concern that one day it won’t be in the right place and something will happen. ‘We need a better treatment if not a cure.’ Dercum’s disease was named after Dr Francis Xavier Dercum who was the personal physician to President Woodrow Wilson in the U.S. He first described the group of signs and symptoms that are characteristic of the disease in 1888. Dercum’s disease is a syndrome of painful growths in subcutaneous fat which can occur anywhere from the scalp to the foot. Adiposis Dolorosa is a condition characterised by painful folds of fatty tissue or the growth of benign fatty tumours. It occurs most often in women who are overweight and symptoms tend to appear between the ages of 35 and 50. The lumps can occur anywhere on the body but are most common on the torso, buttocks, arms and legs. The growths can cause a burning or aching pain that can be severe. Other symptoms include weakness, fatigue, depression, confusion and epilepsy - these symptoms do not occur in everyone with the condition. The cause of the condition is unknown but it is thought to have a genetic component. Treatment usually involves pain relief and the surgical removal of lumps.","Carl Hallam has Adiposis Dolorosa - or Dercum's disease - which causes painful fatty deposits to develop on his chest, arms and back .

It may not sound too appetising, but a culinary trend of eating soil is gathering pace at a Japanese restaurant. Chef Toshio Tanabe uses dirt-based specialties alongside dishes at his Tokyo restaurant Ne Quittez Pas. French-style seafood was always the big seller at Toshio Tanabe's Tokyo restaurant, but the chef for many years had a secret passion - soil. Gathering pace: A culinary trend of eating soil is gathering pace at a Japanese restaurant . Idea: Chef Toshio Tanabe uses dirt-based specialties alongside dishes at his Tokyo restaurant Ne Quittez Pas . His long interest in soil cuisine culminated in a feast that has been growing in popularity with his customers, starting with an amuse bouche of soil soup and ending with a soil sorbet. In an interview with website Modern Farmer he said his soil tastes 'actually like the Earth itself.' 'Man didn't create the sea, the air or the soil. They're simply all part of nature, and in a sense they are alive in their own right,' said Tanabe. 'What I'm trying to do is reflect that feeling in food.' A professional bantamweight boxer in his youth, Tanabe turned his hand to cooking in his twenties and left to train in France. Popularity: His long interest in soil cuisine culminated in a feast that has been growing in populairty with his customers, starting with an amuse bouche of soil soup and ending with a soil sorbet . Dining out: A diner samples a dish from Toshio Tanabe's soil menu . Vision: For the last 20 years he has run a French restaurant in downtown Tokyo, and over the last eight has been slowly introducing his customers to samples of soil-inspired cuisine . In 2011 research emerged that suggests eating mud or clay could actually be good for the stomach. Dining on dirt, or geophagy, is common among many cultures and has been reported in almost every country in the world. Now more than 480 cultural accounts of the practice — by missionaries, plantation doctors and explorers — have been analysed by researchers at Cornell University in New York. While no one is suggesting that mud should be the new fad diet, the study, in The Quarterly Review of Biology, found the most plausible explanation for geophagy could be that earth acts as a shield against ingested parasites and plant toxins. People may also crave dirt because it provides nutrients they lack such as iron, zinc, or calcium, the research found. For the last 20 years he has run a French restaurant in downtown Tokyo, and over the last eight has been slowly introducing his customers to samples of soil-inspired cuisine. At first, though, the search for a clean and chemical-free main ingredient was tough work. 'I had to go all over the place to find soil, into the mountains and places like that. Places where there was no farming,' he said. 'Then of course I had to dig it up from deep under the ground.' 'I buy 20 kilograms a month from Kanuma in Tochigi prefecture. I use black soil for most dishes and white soil — normally used for bonsai plants — for lighter food. The soil is taken from 10 miles underground and checked in a lab for impurities — pollution, contamination, lead. So it is already very safe when I buy it. Soil is a pure living thing, a collection of microorganisms. Anything bad about it, pollution or radiation contamination, is generally caused by humans,' he told Modern Farmer. After the dirt arrives, he lightly cooks it to release the flavour, then runs it through a sieve to remove any stray grains of sand. The six-course soil extravaganza starts with an amuse bouche of soil soup, served with the merest fleck of dirt-engrained truffle, and ends with soil sorbet and a sweet dirt gratin. But Tanabe's pride and joy is the 'soil surprise,' a dirt-covered potato ball with a truffle center. The feast is not especially cheap, running to 10,000 yen ($110, £69) a diner. Many are surprised by the unusual dining experience. 'It was my first time to have soup made from soil,' said Hiromi Fujie, a nearby resident. 'It was a bit gritty but not at all unpleasant, a little like vegetable soup. I liked it.' If Tanabe is to be believed, it's healthy too. He says his soil aids the digestion and is full of healthy minerals. 'Humans used to eat soil, back in the day,' he said, though he had to ruefully acknowledge that not all customers are fans. 'Animals eat is as well, so I suppose there's this impression that soil's a bit too dirty to eat. We do have some customers who completely avoid it.' Research released in 2011 suggests that eating mud or clay could actually be good for the stomach.

Dr Sera Young, who led the study, said the first written account of human geophagy comes from Hippocrates more than 2,000 years ago. The researchers said: 'We hope this paper stimulates more research. 'More importantly, we hope readers agree it is time to stop regarding geophagy as a bizarre, non-adaptive gustatory mistake. 'With these data, it is clear that geophagy is a widespread behaviour in humans that occurs during both vulnerable life stages and when facing ecological conditions that require protection.","Chef Toshio Tanabe uses dirt-based specialties alongside 'normal' dishes .

Alarming: A dossier of shocking cases of pilot fatigue have been released by the British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA) in a bid to urge the Government to block changes to working hours imposed by Brussels (file picture) In the dossier, one pilot also told how, on an another occasion, he had woken up alone in the cockpit of a delayed night-flight after his colleague fell asleep in the toilet. Another spoke of how he and a colleague messed up a landing at Heathrow ‘with possible fatal consequences’ because they were ’punch-drunk with tiredness.’ And a pilot flying from Miami to Heathrow filed an anonymous ‘whistle-blower’ report after he awoke from his own ‘tuned out’ sleep to find his colleague slumped in his seat after ‘nodding off.’ But pilots also said they didn’t always report cases ‘for fear of reprisals.’ Pilots’ leaders claim that Brussels’ proposed ‘unsafe and discredited’ changes to flying hours and rostered rest-periods will increase the chances of tired flight crew nodding off – sometimes simultaneously – at the controls of their aircraft . The new EU rules would allow pilots to land a plane after going 22 hours – and sometimes 24 hours – without sleep, they complain. Up to one in six pilots have already experienced flights where both pilots have nodded off simultaneously, their own research shows. But they say the European Parliament is being asked to rush through automatically the ‘unsafe and unscientific’ changes in a vote next Wednesday despite rejection of the plans last week by their own EU Transport Committee and in the face of widespread opposition in the UK and across Europe.

Last week the European Parliament’s Transport Committee voted by 21 to 13 to reject the EU plans. And MPs in the UK have also criticised the changes which are nevertheless backed by the Government and the Civil Aviation Authority. Now the BALPA has sent a new report to ministers detailing the extent of pilot fatigue to UK Transport Secretary Patrick McLaughlin ministers, the CAA and the EU. The testimony also follows publication by the CAA of an incident report from a Virgin Atlantic pilot flying an Airbus saying he and his colleague were suffering extreme fatigue in the cockpit after having only five hours sleep over two days. But the pair were not asleep ‘simultaneously’. A BALPA poll revealed more than half (56 per cent) of British pilots admitted they had fallen asleep in the cockpit with 1 in 3 of them also saying they had woken to find the other pilot also asleep. Evidence: The testimony also follows publication by the CAA of an incident report from a Virgin Atlantic pilot flying an Airbus saying he and his colleague were suffering extreme fatigue in the cockpit after having only five hours sleep over two days . A spokesman for BALPA said: ‘British pilots have urged the UK Secretary of State for Transport and flight safety regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, to protect our skies and today have sent them a detailed breakdown of how the new EU rules will cut British flight safety by increasing the tiredness of pilots. ‘A dossier of personal testimonials from UK pilots giving first-hand accounts of the severe tiredness already experienced by pilots under current higher-quality UK standards has also been sent to the Minister and CAA .’ But the organisation says: ‘The European Commission has ignored this and is requiring the full European Parliament to confirm the rejection of the unsafe and unscientific rules in a vote on Wednesday. Worried: Louise Ellman who chairs the influential all-party House of Commons Transport Committee agreed with BALPA's concerns . ‘Half of the entire European Parliament must vote to reject the new rules to stop them automatically coming into place, rather than just those present for the vote on Wednesday, when many MEPs are expected to have already left Strasbourg ahead of a recess. ‘ . It adds: ’This would mean that unsafe new EU rules cutting UK flight safety.’ BALPA general secretary Jim McAuslan, said: ‘It is a scandal that the unelected and unaccountable European Commission can force through cuts to UK flight safety that have been rejected by MEPs on their own Transport Committee, UK MPs, pilots across Britain and Europe, scientists and the British flying public. ‘We are urging UK MEPs, the Government and Secretary of State for Transport to keep British skies safe for passengers and urge the Commission to go back to the drawing board.' Louise Ellman who chairs the influential all-party House of Commons Transport Committee and is  Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside said:’I agree with Balpa's concerns that the proposed changes to EU rules could endanger air passenger safety. 'There is still time for the UK Government and Europe to think again.’ A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘We will continue to support the adoption of the proposed regulation as it will improve safety across the EU. ‘The CAA - the UK's specialist aviation safety regulator - is satisfied that the proposed requirements will improve safety across the EU as a whole. 'Flight-time limitation requirements are there to ensure that pilot and other crew members do not operate aircraft with unsafe levels of fatigue. ‘The proposed requirements go further than current requirements by obliging airlines to plan rotas and manage crew duties to actively address the risk of fatigue occurring in the first place.’","BALPA has published a dossier of shocking cases of pilot fatigue today .

She did not give birth to her second daughter Hollie until she was 40, nearly died in the process and was left in intensive care for four days. Now Amanda Holden has admitted she thinks it is ‘a mistake’ for women to leave having children as late in life as she did. Miss Holden, 42, endured the heartache of a miscarriage and then the trauma of giving birth to a stillborn baby at seven months, a son she named Theo, while she was in her late 30s. Proud mother: Amanda Holden with her eldest daughter Lexi who is seven . Bumpy ride: Amanda endured complications with her last pregnancy and the heartbreak of her son Theo being stillborn at seven months . The Britain’s Got Talent judge has warned women against waiting as long as she did to have a family and revealed many of her female friends are now struggling to conceive having put motherhood on hold until their late 30s or 40s. ‘It is a mistake to wait,’ she told an audience at Cheltenham Literature Festival. She said it was better to be in ‘a nice relationship’ before having a baby but she appreciated that ‘wasn’t always easy’. ‘But have your babies before 40 if you can,’ she said. The actress said her ‘girlfriends’ in the entertainment industry had also put off having a family until their late 30s or early 40s and many had struggled to conceive through IVF. ‘All my friends had babies late,’ she said. ‘A lot of them have had trouble.’ But she said she thought attitudes to women in the industry were changing and it was becoming more acceptable to have children while working. ‘Half The Saturdays [a girl band] are pregnant,’ she said. ‘I think that’s a good thing.’ Miss Holden is married to music producer Chris Hughes, who she has described as the love of her life, and they have two daughters, Lexi, 7 and Hollie, who is almost two-years-old. Miss Holden also hit back at criticism she received online for continuing to work after her baby was stillborn and also when her second daughter was born. Asked about Mumsnet, the online mothers’ forum where she was the target of abuse, she said: ‘It could be a really positive thing and there are some great things on there. ‘But there are a lot of people who spend all day slagging people off. ‘I think, why can’t mums support each other? It makes me furious. ‘We all love a good b**** and it is good to have a gossip but there’s so much negativity from women towards other women.’ She added she wanted her two daughters to grow up with ‘a positive relationship with other women’. Happy families: Amanda Holden with husband Chris Hughes and their daughters Lexi and Hollie, pictured shortly after Hollie's birth in 2012 . She explained she had gone straight back into work after both traumatic experiences for the sake of her older daughter Lexi, 7. ‘One day (straight after coming out of hospital) I stayed in my pyjamas,’ she said. ‘Lexi came home from school and was absolutely appalled I was still in my pyjamas, so I never did that again. ‘The normality for her was to see me going back to work.’ She revealed that she had taken newborn Hollie to Britain’s Got Talent auditions in Birmingham when she was just a week old, because she was there when she had last felt her stillborn son Theo kick. ‘The next day I was told he would be stillborn,’ she said. ‘I wanted to make that journey with my actual baby in my arms. ‘If it was Manchester or anywhere else I wouldn’t have done it. ‘But I believe in circles and I came back to where I started.’ Miss Holden was at the festival to promote her autobiography, No Holding Back.","She says she believes it was 'a mistake' to delay motherhood for the sake of her career .

Three daughters of disgraced Lord Antony Lambton said yesterday they are ‘sad and bitterly heartbroken’ that a family war against their brother has ended up in the courts. Their comments came on the first day of a High Court hearing at which they are battling for a share of their late father’s estate. The sisters, including author and former TV presenter Lady Lucinda Lambton, say they are entitled to a proportion of the £12million estate plus further assets – a claim their brother Edward Lambton, the seventh Earl of Durham, contests. Taking legal action: Lady Anne and her sister Lady Lucinda Lambton (right) outside the High Court after today's hearing into their case disputing the inheritance of their late father Lord Lambton . Family dispute: The late Lord Lambton's  daughters have told a top judge they are 'sad and bitterly heartbroken' that a family dispute over their father's estate has ended up in court . Forty years ago Lord Lambton was at the . centre of one of the raciest scandals of his day when he was . photographed cavorting in bed with two prostitutes. Lord Lambton was forced to resign in 1973, when he was photographed in bed with two dominatrix prostitutes . The then junior defence minister was forced to resign and later fled to Italy where he spent the remaining 30 years of his life living in a mansion in Tuscany with his mistress, Claire Ward. When he died aged 84 in 2006 he left his fortune to his only son Edward under the British tradition of primogeniture by which the male heir inherits not only the title but also the entire estate. In the years after his death, three of his five daughters demanded a slice of the family fortune because all children have a right to an equal share under Italian law. They had been in negotiations with their brother and his lawyers and were hoping to receive about £1million each in return for giving up a much larger claim. But Lord Durham, 52, served a High Court writ in May this year in England to prevent them making claims on his inheritance in Italy. The move upset Lucinda, 70, and her sisters Lady Beatrix Nevill, 64, and Lady Anne Lambton, 59, an actress. It was argued at the court in London yesterday that under Italian law, all six of Lord Lambton’s children are entitled to one-ninth each of their father’s ‘heritable property’. The daughters claim the Italian courts should decide what they receive given that Lord Lambton spent his last years in the country. Their counsel Alexander Layton QC told the court the proceedings in England should be stayed and the case should go ahead in Italy. He said the sisters ‘are sad and bitterly heartbroken that this family dispute should have entered into the courts at all’. He said their action in seeking a stay was ‘designed to stop this litigation in order to reach a resolution as soon as possible’. The court heard that the estate of £12.1million was comprised of only certain movable assets, some paintings found in England and a small amount of cash. But Mr Layton said that during his lifetime Lord Lambton owned valuable assets, including fine collections of paintings, furniture, books and wine, and money in trusts, so the estate could be worth much more. That could put the sisters’ claim under Italian law ‘in the region of millions of pounds’. Lord Durham claims the English court should deal with the matter. His counsel Dominic Dowley QC said Lord Lambton had remained a British citizen. The hearing continues.

But instead of griping to his friends and one or two followers about British Airways, the businessman paid to have his tweet promoted - sending it to the top of BA's Twitter feed and the feeds of related companies across the world. Under his handle @HVSVN, Mr Syed's promoted tweet read: 'Don't fly @BritishAirways. Their customer service is horrendous.' Complaint: Hasan Syed's tweet has now been removed, but not before it attracted tens of thousands of views . Mr Syed bought the promoted tweet through Twitter's self-service ad platform for an undisclosed sum of money. He then followed up his initial message with a series of posts criticising the airline for losing his parents' luggage on their weekend trip from Chicago to Paris. 'BritishAirways is the worst airline ever. Lost my luggage & can't even track it down. Absolutely pathetic' he wrote. This was followed with: 'Thanks for ruining my EU business trip #britishairways. I shouldn't have flown @BritishAirways. Never flying with you again.' Promoted tweets are usually bought by advertisers who want to reach a wider audience, and who pay for the message to appear in high prominence in the Twitter feed of relevant companies. They also appear in search results for a promoted trend and in some cases on users' timelines, while still acting as normal messages that can be retweeted by anyone. But Mr Syed's tweet, which targeted UK and New York markets related to BA, did the exact opposite of advertising the airline. The airline took four hours to respond to Mr Syed via a direct message on the social networking site that read: 'Sorry for the delay in responding, our twitter feed is open 09:00-17:00 GMT. Please DM [direct message] your baggage ref and we'll look into this.' Delay: British Airways lost Mr Syed's parents' luggage during their trip from Chicago to Paris . But the tweet had already been read by thousands of viewers, according to aviation marketing cosultants SimpliFlying, and within six hours had gained more than 25,000 impressions on Twitter - not including its coverage on popular blogs such as Mashable, which first reported the story. They blamed the delay on its Twitter feed only being open '0900-1700 GMT,' rather than 24 hours, and asked the customer to send over his luggage information in a direct message. A spokesperson for the airline said: 'We would like to apologise to the customer for the inconvenience caused. We have been in contact with the customer and the bag is due to be delivered today.' Marty St. George, senior vice president of marketing at JetBlue, tweeted: 'Interesting; a disgruntled customer is buying a . promoted tweet slamming a brand where they had a bad experience. That's a . new trend itself!' In 2009, Dave Carroll and his band, Sons of Maxwell, took on United Airlines in 2009 with the video United Breaks Guitars detailing how United had failed to reimburse Carroll after his guitar was broken in 2008. The video went viral. And a complaint letter sent to Richard Branson, complaining about the food on Virgin Atlantic planes, also went viral in 2009. Branson himself phoned the author of the letter for his 'constructive if tongue-in-cheek' email and invited him to select the food and wines for future Virgin flights.","Businessman pays 'undisclosed sum' for complaint against British Airways to be promoted on Twitter .

David, 41, from Dublin, Ireland, said ‘The seals were making their way back to Seal Island after feeding out at sea and the sharks travel below them. ‘The sharks are really well camouflaged due to their dark backs and when the seal looks down it is hard to make out the shark in the dark below. ‘When the shark picks its time to attack, it can accelerate at around 25mph upwards which can send both the shark and the seal flying up out of the water.

She gave nine months of her life . to give us a child.’ Delight: Rekha Patel, 42 (right), from Britain, holds her week-old-baby girl, Gabriella, as she stands next to a doctor at the Akanksha IVF centre in Anand town . Sweet dreams: Gabriella sleeps in a hotel room in Anand town . It . is the perfect promotion for India's booming surrogacy industry that . sees thousands of infertile couples, many from overseas, hiring the . wombs of local women to carry their embryos through to birth. But . a debate over whether the unregulated industry exploits poor women . prompted authorities to draft a law that could make it tougher for . foreigners seeking babies made in India. ‘There . is a need to regulate the sector,’ said Dr. Sudhir Ajja of Surrogacy . India, a Mumbai-based fertility bank that has produced 295 surrogate . babies - 90 percent for overseas clients and 40 percent for same-sex . couples - since it opened in 2007. Proud: Rekha holds her week-old-baby girl Gabriella, as her husband Daniele Fabbricatore, 39, looks on . ‘But . if the new law tightens rules as suggested by the ministry of home . affairs, which disallows surrogacy for same-sex couples and single . parents, then it will clearly impact the industry and put off clients . coming from overseas.’ India . opened up to commercial surrogacy in 2002. It is among just a handful . of countries - including Georgia, Russia, Thailand and Ukraine - and a . few U.S. states where women can be paid to carry another's genetic child . through a process of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and embryo transfer. The . low-cost technology, skilled doctors, scant bureaucracy and a plentiful . supply of surrogates have made India a preferred destination for . fertility tourism, attracting nationals from Britain, the United States, . Australia and Japan, to name a few. There . are no official figures on how large the fertility industry is in . India. A U.N.-backed study in July 2012 estimated the surrogacy business . at more than $400 million a year (£250 million), with over 3,000 fertility clinics . across India. The . Akanksha clinic in Anand is the best-known at home and abroad, giving . the small town in Gujarat state the reputation as India's ‘surrogacy . capital’. ‘The . surrogates in Anand have become empowered through giving this beautiful . gift to others,’ says Akanksha's owner, IVF specialist Nayana Patel, . who shot to fame in 2004 after she helped a patient have a baby by using . the woman's mother - the child's grandmother - as a surrogate. Adoring: Rekha looks at Gabriella at the IVF centre, which is one of about 3,000 fertility clinics in India . ‘With . the money, they are able to buy a house, educate their children and . even start a small business. These are things they could only dream of . before. It's a win-win situation.’ Patel, . who appeared on U.S. celebrity Oprah Winfrey's talk show in 2007, has . produced more than 500 surrogate babies - two-thirds of them for . foreigners and people of Indian origin living in over 30 countries. Charging . couples like Rekha and Daniel an average of $25,000 to $30,000, a . fraction of the cost in the United States, Patel pays her surrogates . around 400,000 rupees (£4,000 or $6,500). For . 33-year-old Naina Patel, who gave birth to Gabrielle, the compensation . outweighs the downside. The wife of an auto-rickshaw driver with three . daughters of her own, she had to live in a hostel for nine months with . 60 other surrogates so the clinic could monitor her health. India's surrogacy industry is vilified by women's rights groups . Like most surrogates, she kept her pregnancy a secret due to the social stigma in India's conservative society. ‘I . was happy to do it but it was not really out of choice because we . needed the money,’ she said in a hospital bed as she recovered from the . Caesarean operation for Gabrielle's birth. India's . surrogacy industry is vilified by women's rights groups who say . fertility clinics are nothing more than ‘baby factories’ for the rich. In the absence of regulation, they say many poor and uneducated women . are lured by agents, hired by clinics, into signing contracts they do . not fully understand. In . May last year, surrogate mother Premila Vaghela, 30, died days after . delivering a child for an American couple at a clinic in Gujarat. It was . recorded as an ‘accidental death’ by police. Rekha touches surrogate mother Naina Patel's (centre) biological daughter inside a temporary home for surrogates provided by the Akanksha IVF centre . A . recent government-funded study of 100 surrogate mothers in Delhi and . Mumbai found there was ‘no fixed rule’ related to compensation and no . insurance for post-delivery healthcare. It cited cases where surrogates . were implanted with embryos multiple times to raise the chances of . success. ‘In . most of these cases, the surrogate mothers are being exploited,’ said . Ranjana Kumari, director of the Centre for Social Research that . conducted the study. Moves . to introduce a law - the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Bill (ART) - . to protect surrogates, the children and the commissioning parents is . long overdue, Kumari said. Revised . visa requirements introduced in July have already resulted in foreign . same-sex couples and individuals being prohibited from surrogacy in . India. The ART bill, expected to come before parliament next year, will . tighten things further. Under . the current draft, all fertility clinics must be registered and . monitored by a regulatory authority. Surrogates must be between 21 and . 35 years old, they will be provided with insurance and notarised . contracts must be signed between the women and the commissioning . parents. ‘Legislation . should be there so that this wonderful procedure can be supervised and . it is being done by the right people for the right people,’ said .

The newlywed accused of pushing her husband off a cliff just eight days into their marriage was too ashamed to face her family after he asked her for an annulment, it was claimed today. Montana bride Jordan Linn Graham, 22, pleaded not guilty to murder charges last week after she was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in the death of her husband Cody Johnson. Police believe the newlywed pushed her husband off a cliff in Montana's Glacier National Park after a heated argument. 'One of the police theories is that the new bride ""snapped"" after her husband figured out she had lied about being in love with him. She was only in love with the idea of being a bride,' a source close to the investigation told the National Enquirer. Second thoughts: Ms Graham told a friend the morning of the day her husband went missing that she was doubting the viability of the ill-fated marriage . Her day in court: Jordan Linn Graham, 22, pleaded not guilty Friday to murdering husband Cody Lee Johnson this past July . The source also revealed that authorities believe Cody told her he . wanted a divorce or an annulment and she couldn't face telling her friends . her husband already wanted out of the week-old marriage, so she came up with a crazy plan to kill him and make it look like an accident, it is believed. The couple had been together for less than two years when they got married and it is said both of them were having doubts about tying the knot. A friend of the accused murderer told . the Enquirer: 'Jordan was a dreamer who was more excited about the idea . of marriage than actually being married. 'She loved picking the wedding dress . and showing off her ring, but on the day of the actual wedding, she . sobbed uncontrollably.' The Kalispell woman has insisted from the very beginning that her husband's death was an accident. Their tragic story has garnered national media attention almost from the very beginning, with Graham even pleading her case on magazine covers. Married only eight days when Mr Johnson, 25, disappeared July 7, Graham first told investigators that Johnson's 'buddies from Washington probably came and got him,' according to the indictment. Investigators have accused the widowed woman of pushing her husband off a cliff down onto a viewing area known as the Loop during a July 7 argument after having second thoughts about the marriage. Still free: Jordan Linn Graham, center, leaves the federal courthouse after pleading not guilty to three charges stemming from the death of her husband . Doomed: Ms Graham's second thought about her marriage to Mr Johnson saw the union tragically end only eight days after they were married . Reported missing on July 8 when he did . not show up at work, authorities were unable to find Mr Johnson's body . until July 11 when Graham told officials she found it in the hard to . reach spot after she thought to look there. Ms Johnson cryptically told investigators 'it was a place he wanted to see before he died'. As time wore on, and investigators began piecing together their case against Graham, her story began to change. Having first told authorities that . her dead husband drove off in a dark car the night he disappeared, . Graham admitted July 16 they had an argument at the park the night he . died. Graham told investigators she and Mr Johnson . argued on the trail. When he grabbed her . arm as she turned to walk away, she pushed him with both hands in . the back, causing him to fall head-first from a steep cliff, according to an . affidavit. Earlier that day, Graham told a friend she was having second thoughts about getting married and meant to talk to Johnson about it, according to the affidavit. She said if the friend didn't hear from her again that night, 'something happened.' Two people who knew the couple told local Montana newspaper that they had their doubts about the wedding. 'We . all had our reservations about their relationship,' Levi Blasdel told . the Daily Inter Lake. 'She seemed so remote from the relationship, so . withdrawn.' That emotional distance carried over to her husband's funeral. 'At the funeral, a number of us had spoken, and while I gave my memorial for Cody at the podium, she was messing around on her phone,' said Mr Blasdel. 'It was very hard for all of us to be there crying and mourning the loss of our friend and she was so unresponsive to that, really no emotion, no crying, very sober,' he added. Not a care in the world: Those who knew her said Ms Graham carried on with her life like nothing happened in the days after her husband's death . Her behavior stood in stark contrast to the crying woman seen before she walked down the aisle at her wedding, Mr Blasdel explained. Despite Ms Graham's unusual reaction to the death of her husband, no one suspected her in the death. It was not until she kept trying to explain the circumstances surrounding his disappearance that doubt began to creep in. 'I don’t think anyone suspected her directly until all of us heard different stories from her,” Lytaunie Blasdel told the Daily Inter Lake. 'That’s when it got weird.' Another friend told authorities that Ms Graham confided during a church service that her husband had died after falling off a cliff - this conversation is said in the affidavit to have happened the day before she 'found' his body at the base of the cliff. Ms Graham had appeared in court last month on a second-degree murder charge and was released after the judge deemed her not to be a flight risk. She is currently in the custody of her parents. If convicted of first-degree murder, Ms Graham faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison. She is due back in court Oct. 15.","Jordan Linn Graham and Cody Lee Johnson were married only eight days when he disappeared .

Fortunately so, for this pier in California appears to be the place for doing both, regardless of how many other sea lions have the same idea. Piled on top of each other, sometimes three or four mammals high, you might expect there to be some arguments. Move up! A snug harem of sea lions loll around on top of each other on a crowded pier in California . But, according to photographer Michael Yang, the lazy sea lions seemed not bothered in the slightest about being crushed and walked over. Animals of all shapes and sizes were piled onto the pier at Moss Landing, in Monterey Bay, California. The snug scene was captured this week on sunny day when the pod of sea lions had 'taken over' the pier, 'trying to keep themselves dry and warm'. Tolerant: Remarkably, the large, smelly animals seemed quite happy in such close proximity to each other; those under several others didn't appear to mind . Photographer Michael Yang said male sea lions average over 600 pounds in weight while female sea lions are just over 200 pounds . Sea lion soup: 'Other than keeping clear of the pier, staying upwind of these massive creatures is also a good idea,' said Mr Yang . 'There are so many of them on the pier that, in some places, they are sleeping on top of each other,' he said. The photographer said male sea lions weigh an average of over 600 pounds, while female sea lions are just over 200 pounds. 'They must have a really thick layer of blubber cushioning them; the sea lions on the bottom didn't seem to be bothered by the fact that there were several other sea lions sleeping on top of it.' Mr Yang speculates: 'They must have a really thick layer of blubber cushioning them; the sea lions on the bottom didn't seem to be bothered by the fact that there were several other sea lions sleeping on top of it.' People are advised to keep away from the pier in Moss Landing, California, which becomes a home for the sea lions every year . He said aside from making an impressive photo, he advised steering clear of the pier, especially being down-wind of the animals. 'With just a small change of the wind, you can catch a strong scent of rotten fish emanating from them,'  he said. He added: 'I've been going to Moss Landing to photograph for several years now and the sea lions are always on the pier, sleeping and basking in the sun. 'In fact, there is a sign posted on the pier that reads: ""Danger. Attention Kayakers. Stay Clear of Dock"".' Stay clear: Kayakers are warned to keep away from the sea lions which weigh more than twice the average weight of a person .

A £1.2billion ‘electronic borders’ system supposed to stop terrorists, foreign criminals and illegal immigrants getting into Britain has descended into a shambles, an official report reveals today. Ten years after it was devised by Labour ministers, e-borders is failing to meet most of its objectives, leaving a string of gaping holes in the protections it promised to deliver. Some 70million passengers a year – one in three of the total – are arriving without undergoing background checks because of European Union data protection rules, inspectors found. Shambles: The £1.2billion 'electronic borders' system has failed to stop terrorists, foreign criminals and illegal immigrants getting into Britain, an official report reveals . The report reveals: . The report is the second in two months from chief inspector of borders and immigration John Vine to have been heavily redacted by Home Secretary Theresa May. The report is the second in two months from chief inspector of borders and immigration John Vine (pictured) to have been heavily redacted by Home Secretary Theresa May . Some 39 paragraphs or entries were deleted, and four tables of figures, on the grounds that revealing them could undermine national security. But the raft of deletions will raise questions about whether embarrassing holes in border controls are being covered up. Last night, Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, said the e-borders programme had been a ‘catastrophe for the British taxpayer’. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said it had ‘ground to a halt causing serious failures in border security’. However, senior officials insisted the number of passengers covered by e-borders was rising and set to grow even further in coming months. When the full plans for e-borders were drawn up in 2007 Labour ministers promised to ‘export the border’ to other countries by forcing anyone trying to get into Britain to reveal their personal information in advance. Passed on by carriers, it is then checked against watch lists and security databases and logged on a vast database. Extremists, criminals and wanted criminals could either be arrested at the airport or turned away. By the end of this year, 95 per cent of all journeys into the country were supposed to be covered by the system. But the report reveals just 65 per cent of journeys are covered. The European Commission blew the most gaping hole in the system by ruling that it would breach free movement rules to force EU citizens to hand their data over in advance. As a result, passengers arriving on flights from Europe can refuse to undergo advance screening. By the end of this year, 95 per cent of all journeys into the country were supposed to be covered by the system. However, the report reveals just 65 per cent of journeys are covered . Yesterday, Sir Charles Montgomery, the former Royal Navy warship commander now in charge of Britain’s borders, was bullish about the prospect for increasing coverage in the coming months. He indicated that a major European airline was about to sign up. He also said the system had allowed the arrest of thousands of criminals, including murderers and rapists. But Mr Vine’s report found this extension of police and security service capability was the only one of the eight main justifications for the project – which has already swallowed more than £500million of taxpayers’ cash – to have been achieved. Mr Vine heavily criticised the deletion of warnings about drugs and smuggled tobacco which was done to prioritise immigration work. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘Passengers travelling to Britain are checked across a variety of databases before departure and upon arrival. ‘We now take Advance Passenger Information from 78 per cent of those travelling to the UK by plane, and require this information from 100 per cent of those travelling from outside the EU. 'We have the best coverage of any country in Europe but we are working to improve our coverage further.’","70million passengers a year are arriving in UK without background checks .

The system is unable to count people in and out, leaving officials in the dark about the true scale of illegal immigration.
Technical problems mean people arriving on ferries, Eurostar trains, cruise ships and small planes are not screened in advance.
Even when known criminals and illegals are flagged by the system, airports may not be phoned in advance to warn about their impending arrival.
Nearly 650,000 Customs records about drugs and other contraband were deleted without even being read.
The system is not being used to track tax fraudsters and benefits cheats going on holiday because of technical problems.

A teenage hairdresser was groped by an NHS doctor during an examination where he told her 'you’re very beautiful', a court heard today. Dr Kamal Abusin, 54, is accused of treating the hairdresser as 'a model' rather than a vulnerable patient. The 19-year-old woman went to A&E with stomach pains after having an operation. A court heard Abusin told the teenager she was 'very beautiful' before stroking her breast and groping her during the stomach examination. The court heard that after the 20-minute examination, she walked into the waiting room and burst into tears when her boyfriend asked her how it had gone. Assault: Dr Kamal Abusin, 54, is accused of sexually assaulting a young woman during an examination in A&E . Prosecutor Janet McDonald said Dr Abusin had abused his 'position of trust and authority' to sexually assault the young woman. Miss McDonald said: 'This was not a nightclub where a drunken reveller might try it on and go too far with a pretty girl. 'This was a consultant room with a sober and senior consultant in attendance. 'The groping or touching are very serious to this young woman and for society. 'We put trust in the medical profession to deal with a patient appropriately. We don’t expect to be groped.' A&E: The woman was assaulted after she went to Royal Glamorgan Hosiptal in Llantrisant, South Wales. She was suffering stomach pains following an operation . Cardiff Crown Court heard the young woman, who cannot be named, had undergone keyhole surgery 'just below her belly button' six weeks earlier. She went to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, South Wales, complaining of abdominal pain in February this year. The jury heard Dr Abusin lifted her top to 'remove a hair' before groping her. Miss McDonald said: 'She was called into the room by the doctor and he made comments about her appearance before telling her to lie on the examination table. 'He told her she was beautiful, had a well proportioned body, a good figure and asked her to take her hair down. 'She trusted him and did what he asked. 'Was he looking at her as a patient or more as one might admire the physique of a model? 'He didn’t ask her to assist and pushed her top up so he could see her tummy and this exposed one of her breasts in her bra. 'He went to remove a strand of hair that was on her right breast - and he took the opportunity to grope her breast. 'This was not the way he was supposed to examine her tummy.' Miss McDonald said this made the young patient 'uncomfortable' - and she tried to get the doctor to concentrate on diagnosing the cause of her stomach pains. But during the stomach examination with his hands he ran them up her thighs and touched her intimately - over the top of her leggings. Miss McDonald told the court: 'There was absolutely no reason for him to do that. 'It was not a medical examination - it was the doctor sexually assaulting a vulnerable patient. 'He did examine her tummy but then put his hands down onto her pubic bone and left it there before a hand back on the inside of her thigh. 'She sat up thoroughly unnerved by the situation and asked him what she should do next about the pain she was suffering from. 'He gave her some advice about going back to the GP. 'As she walked left the room she walked straight out and burst into tears and told her boyfriend what had happened.' Dr Abusin, a consultant surgeon, 'vehemently denied' the accusations when questioned by police . The young woman immediately told her concerned boyfriend and asked the A&E receptionist how she could complain. Dr Abusin, who is originally from Sudan but was doing shifts in hospitals around Britain, was arrested by police soon after the complaint. The consultant surgeon 'vehemently denied' all accusations of sexual assault when questioned by police. He said the examination as outlined by the young woman was not one that would be required from a medical point of view and was not what he had given her. Dr Abusin, of Vauxhall Bridge Road, London, denies two charges of sex assault. The trial continues.

A stalker obsessed with a former beauty queen was jailed for four months today after he ‘tagged’ a Facebook photograph of her with the word 'slut'. In July last year Anthony Mantova was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to harassing 21-year-old singer Chloe Hopkins. Magistrates imposed an indefinite restraining order banning Mantova, who had the Welsh beauty queen’s name tattooed on his chest, from contacting her or creating any communication about her. Stalker Anthony Mantova was jailed for four months today after tagging Chloe Hopkins as 'slut' in a Facebook photograph . The court heard that Mantova, who suffers from multiple schlerosis, fell out with Miss Hopkins and sent her numerous text messages and emails, made sexually motivated Facebook comments and followed her. In November he was jailed for another 28 days after admitting breaching the restraining order. But prosecutor Richard Edwards told Caernarfon crown court that in March her boyfriend received a Facebook request from Mantova asking to ‘tag’ a photograph and he accidentally allowed this. Mantova, 35, was jailed for 18 weeks in July last year after admitting to harassing the 21-year-old singer (right, black dress) Mantova wrote ‘slut’ across Miss Hopkins’ forehead. Frances . Hertzog, defending, said that when 35-year-old Mantova, of Meliden, . Prestatyn, Wales, was last imprisoned he left jail in a wheelchair. ‘His grave concern is incarceration is going to have a detrimental impact on his health,’ she said. Judge Peter Heywood told Mantova : ‘I have a victim impact statement that indicates the significant effect your conduct in harassing Miss Hopkins has had. ‘It has affected her health significantly. She’s had to undergo counselling and lost time at work.’ He added: ‘Your actions have had a devastating effect on her.’ He admitted breaching the restraining order again. The original case heard that while she was Miss Prestatyn in 2010 Mantova suggested her tiara and sash ‘would look good on his bedroom floor’. Mantova had four names tattooed on his chest of the victim and her friends, sent unwanted birthday, Valentine’s and Christmas cards, and placed a lewd comment on the Miss Prestatyn website. He even had a picture of Miss Hopkins printed on a T shirt which he wore in public.","Anthony Mantova 'tagged' photo of Chloe Hopkins with the word 'slut'

Victoria Duval, a 17-year-old from Miami, pulled off the biggest shock of the U.S Open so far yesterday, knocking out 2011 Champion Samantha Stosur in the first round. But Duval also has an incredible backstory. She was born in Florida, but grew up in her parents' home country of . Haiti. When she was 7, she and some cousins were taken . hostage there by robbers. After that traumatic episode she moved back to the U.S but when Haiti was rocked by an earthquake in 2010, her father was buried in rubble, badly injured and lucky to survive. New star: Teenager Victoria Duval, ranked 296, pulled off a huge upset against 2011 Champion Samantha Stosur on Tuesday. Her backstory is also incredible . Determination: Until Tuesday, Duval did not own a victory over anyone ranked higher than 69th. She had not faced a woman in the top 20. Stosur was seeded 11 . On Tuesday Duval, who is ranked 296, shocked Australian 11th seed Stosur in three sets - 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 - creating one of the biggest upsets in tournament history. When asked about the hostage incident afterwards she replied: 'It's . not a good memory, so I've tried to forget as much as I could about . it. I don't remember too much . of it anymore, which is great.' Roared to victory by a loud Flushing Meadows crowd, Duval, now based in Bradenton, Florida, enjoyed her on-court interview after her famous win. 'There's . a lot to be thankful for. I don't take anything for granted...  My Dad . is really fortunate to be here,' she told the Louis Armstrong Stadium . crowd. 'I thank God every day for everything that's happened. Life is short,' the new star added. Pride: Jean-Maurice Duval (center in red) watches his daughter's famous win. He was lucky to survive the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, when he was buried alive for hours . Duval nearly lost her father in the devastating earthquakes in Haiti in 2010. Her doctor dad, Jean-Maurice, shuttled between the U.S. and operating a clinic in the island nation. 'One morning we got a call from him and he was (trapped) under the house,' Victoria told CNN in 2011. 'He was sort of giving us his last words and said to my mum, 'Tell the kids I love them.' Mum just collapsed on the floor, but she said, 'No, no, no, you are going to make it.'' Jean-Maurice was buried alive for hours. He did eventually escape but was left with a punctured lung, a shattered arm and five broken ribs. Real estate developer Harry Kitchen, a friend of the family through tennis connections, paid $30,000 to airlift Victoria's dad back to the U.S., where he received the attention that saved his life. His daughter did him proud on Tuesday. Overcoming the sort of nerves that derive from never before having played this highly ranked an opponent - let alone beaten one - and never before having won a match at a Grand Slam tournament, Duval hopped up and down with arms overhead after pulling off the surprise win. 'I don't even remember match point,' she said Tuesday night, less than two hours after closing out Stosur with a forehand winner. Catastrophe: A refugee camp in Haiti following the devastating earthquake in January 2010. Duval's father nearly died in the horrific tragedy . 'I guess I was really happy. I mean, you could tell by all the jumping I did.' She wore a white towel around her neck, giggled at her own squeaky-voiced answers, and genuinely seemed to be enjoying the whole experience during a news conference that was a meandering affair, befitting Duval's bubbly personality - and the long, unique journey that brought her to this point . Duval, who needed to go through qualifying to get into the U.S. Open because her ranking is so low, joined eight other American women in the second round of the main draw. Tuesday also was a good day for American men, who went 5-2, led by No. 13 John Isner and No. 26 Sam Querrey. 'We're obviously trying to make American tennis become what it used to be,' Duval said. 'We're all working toward the same goal. 'We're all a tight-knit group. Helping each other is important. I think we're on an amazing path.' Until Tuesday, Duval did not own a victory over anyone ranked higher than 69th. She had not faced a woman in the top 20. She only had played one match at a major tournament, a first-round loss to Kim Clijsters at last year's U.S. Open (which turned out to be the final singles victory of the Belgian's career). Support: Duval was backed by a loud New York crowd during her massive victory . Stosur was unhappy with the way she played Tuesday, including 10 double-faults and a total of 56 unforced errors, 21 more than Duval. 'I'm not going to be a sore loser and say she didn't do anything,' said Stosur. 'But, you know, I think I certainly helped her out there today, that's for sure.' Next for Duval, who wears white-framed eyeglasses and a visor on court, is a matchup against Daniela Hantuchova, who has been ranked as high as No. 5 and been a Grand Slam quarterfinalist.","New tennis star Victoria Duval, 17, born in Miami but grew up in Haiti .

A strange second 'moon' orbiting the Earth that has baffled astronomers for the last month, is actually of human origin, scientists said. The mysterious object known as '2013 QW1' was spotted in August as part of the PanSTARRS asteroid survey in Hawaii and immediately caught the attention of researchers who noticed it is orbiting the Earth and wanted to know its identity. Scientists at the European Space Agency observing the near Earth object moving in an Earth-centred orbit were keen to find out whether it was natural or artificial. The mysterious object can be seen moving in a GIF below. The scientists suspect the object is part of a rocket stage, similar to the labeled part on the rocket pictured . Scientists came up with various theories to explain the identity of the moving 'dot' shown on a screen (above), ranging from an asteroid caught in a wide orbit around the Earth, to a piece of space debris or even a small second moon. However, the mystery was solved by staff at the European Space Agency's NEO Coordination Centre, who tracked the object with an Italian telescope with help from researchers at the Observatoire de Paris. Davide Perna, a member of the team, said that finding the object 'was a bit of a challenge, because the object was moving fast' compared to a typical near Earth object. The scientists declared the object 'artificial' and think it is very probably part of a booster stage rocket. It is not the first time that scientists have rediscovered a lost rocket stage close to the edge of the earth's gravitational reach. When the third stage of the Apollo 12 mission failed to crash on the Moon as planned, it drifted through space and then orbited the Earth, before being rediscovered in 2002. Its man-made origin was revealed by analysing the light reflected by the rocket body, . which did not resemble that of an asteroid, but rather revealed the titanium-enriched white paint used at that time for the Apollo rockets. However, the process to identify 2013 QW1 was trickier. Scientists came up with various theories to explain the identity of the mysterious near Earth object, ranging from an asteroid caught in a wide orbit around the Earth, to a piece of space debris or even a small second moon. Our own Earth and its one true moon is pictured . Dr Perna said: 'Despite the difficulties, . observations were made with an instrument called DOLORES, for ""Device . Optimised for the LOw RESolution,"" which allowed us to obtain the . object’s spectrum.' The spectrum bore strong similarities with the spectra of . previously observed space junk such as discarded rocket stages, . abandoned boosters or defunct satellite, ESA said. Detlef Koschny, who is responsible for NEO activities at ESA's Space Situational Awareness programme office, said: 'The observations by European astronomers coordinated by ESA demonstrated a very quick reaction in getting high-quality data that conclusively identified the object as artificial, and hence no threat.'","The mysterious object known as '2013 QW1' was spotted in August as part of the PanSTARRS asteroid survey in Hawaii .

The robot must adopt human-like amounts of pressure on certain joins and letters - perhaps such as dotting an I - as well as not smudging the writing to make it looks authentic. Curiously the robot appears to write from the bottom of the page upwards and from right to left - the opposite way of composing a card in the western world. The service is currently only available in the U.S. where affluent customers can skip writing their own cards, which cost $5. For the price, customers get a 255 character message on a gold-embossed card sealed with wax that is sent to their desired recipient. Bond is primarily concerned with selling gifts, from designer candles and chocolates to vintage sporting gear and users can browse for presents that can cost in excess of $250, to go with their robot-written note. In the future, the company plans on offering a variety of handwriting styles so customers can pick the one that most closely resembles their own cursive, as well as rolling out an Android app and conventional website. The robotic card writing service is available in the U.S for $5 for a 225 character message on a gold-embossed card sealed with wax that can be sent to a desired recipient. The text can be ordered using an iOS app, together with a range of luxury gifts .","The robot imitates human handwriting using fluid movements and differing pressures to make the cursive look authentic .

Fighting back: Jessica Krigsman, 24, has sued the NYPD after she was arrested for going topless in a Brooklyn Park last summer . A performance artist who was arrested for going topless in a New York City park sued the NYPD on Tuesday for forcing her to cover up. Jessica Krigsman, 24, filed the suit for unspecified damages, after she was arrested by two officers last July in Brooklyn's Calvert Vaux Park. Miss Krigsman, from Gravesend, New York, had been relaxing on a bench without her top when she was told to cover her breasts. The officers, one male and one female, who approached the young woman told her to put on a shirt and asked for ID. She responded that it was her right to sun herself topless, citing a 1992 New York State Court of Appeals, which states that baring one's chest in public is legal for a woman as it is for a man. In May, the NYPD released an official memo  informing all police officers that it is not illegal for women to walk around the city shirtless, and that they should not be cited for public lewdness or indecent exposure. However it did not stop the officers from hauling Miss Krigsman down to the precinct in handcuffs where she was arrested and held for five hours. She was charged with obstruction of a sitting area but the charge was later dropped. Her lawyer Stuart Jacobs told the New York Post: 'The female cop picked up Jessica’s shirt . and forced it onto her. 'She didn’t resist in any way or . fight in any way. They arrested her and cuffed her, and took her to the . precinct.' The lawsuit was filed at Brooklyn Supreme Court this week leaving the city's law department to review the case. Miss Krigsman, from Gravesend, New York, had been relaxing on a bench with her top off when she was told to cover her breasts by two NYPD officers . Miss Krigsman's lawsuit is the latest incident to draw attention to discrepancies in the law over women going topless. Like most U.S. states, it is not illegal for a woman to have an exposed chest in New York anywhere that it is okay for a man to do the same. However, it has not stopped individuals being cited for 'public indecency' or 'disorderly conduct'. In July, model Cheyenne Lutek and photographer Allen Henson made a statement about female nudity at trendy Italian restaurant Verso in the East Village. Miss Lutek sat at a table with her breasts exposed while Mr Henson pulled out his camera to snap the scene. Verso's owner Labinot Baraliu rushed over the table and demanded that the half-naked woman put her clothes back on. In response, Miss Lutek insisted that it was 'perfectly legal' to go topless in the restaurant. After exchanging a few words with the owner, the couple were escorted out of the bistro. Despite the legislation because a restaurant is private property, its patrons are subject to whatever rules the business has in place.

Maths teacher: Neil Mason, 28, made sexual suggestions to some girls, often texting under a pseudonym and using Facebook . A maths teacher who offered schoolgirls £300 to pose topless and sent naked pictures of himself to a 16-year-old girl has been jailed for more than two years. Neil Mason, 28 - who taught at The Heath School in Runcorn, Cheshire - made sexual suggestions to girls, often texting under a pseudonym and using Facebook, Chester Crown Court heard. He used pupils at the school as ‘sex objects of desire to satisfy his sexual lust’ and admitted intimately kissing the girl to whom he sent the naked images on the lips and stroking her leg. Maria Masselis, prosecuting, added: ‘There was a lengthy and intense history of inappropriate contact. He wanted her to go to his home and engage in sexual contact. She felt scared. He stroked her leg and kissed her on the mouth.’ Police found 17 images of the girl, topless and nude, on his computer. Other victims said they felt ‘scared’ and ‘betrayed’ and could no longer trust male teachers. The judge described Mason as ‘a parent’s worst nightmare’ who had ‘corrupted’ the lives of children. Mason admitted ten charges which involved four victims between March 2012 and December 2012. They were two counts of causing girls under 15 to . engage in sexual activity, six counts of adult abuse of position of trust . against girls over 16, and two charges of making indecent photographs. He pleaded not guilty to causing a child under . 16 to engage in sexual activity and this will lie on file. Rachel Shenton, defending, said Mason had a serious gambling addiction and faced huge debts. He was now living with his parents who had offered emotional and financial support. Predator: He used the pupils at The Heath School (pictured) in Runcorn, Cheshire as 'sex objects of desire to satisfy his sexual lust' and admitted kissing a 16-year-old intimately on the lips and stroking her leg . His father had repaid £41,000, writing off ten of his pay day loans. Ms Shenton said: ‘This was a period of utter madness. This was a man who was going to pieces in every area of his life. Action: Mason was immediately suspended as soon as allegations of sexual misconduct came to light . ‘He has lost everything, his reputation, his good character, his home, his relationship and his career. This is a young man who has made a huge mistake with huge implications.’ She said Mason is undergoing professional treatment for his addiction and had enrolled on a master’s degree in quantity surveying and financial management. Mason was put on the sex offender’s register for life and was disqualified from working with children. His indecent images will be destroyed. Sentencing, the Recorder of Chester, Judge Elgin Edwards, said: ‘Over a period of 12 months, you abused your trust as a maths teacher at The Heath School in Runcorn.  Your conduct was quite deplorable. ‘Parents have a right to expect that their children will be safe when they are in school and be taught, not regarded as sex objects of desire to satisfy a teacher’s sexual lust. ‘That is what you did to these four girls. You are a sexual predator. You have brought shame on your profession, yourself, your family, your school and your colleagues. ‘Children are sent to school to learn and be educated, not to be corrupted by a man like you.  You have endeavoured to corrupt four girls. This is a parent’s worst nightmare.’ Mason was jailed for two-and-a-half years. After the sentencing, Cheshire Police Detective Constable Tim Murray said: ‘Mason used his position of trust to prey on vulnerable teenage girls. Sentencing: Chester Crown Court (pictured) in Cheshire was told Mason is undergoing professional treatment for his addiction and had enrolled on a master's degree in quantity surveying and financial management . ‘Each of the girls looked up to Mason and came to see him as a friend as well as a teacher and he manipulated those relationships in a bid to satisfy his own sexual desires. ‘I would like to praise the courage of the victims for not only reporting Mason’s inappropriate behaviour, but also for supporting the prosecution. ‘There can be little doubt that these incidents will have a lasting effect on the victims but we will continue to work with them to ensure they have all the support they need. I hope that the conclusion of this case will give them some closure. 'Children are sent to school to learn and be educated, not to be corrupted by a man like you.  You have endeavoured to corrupt four girls. This is a parent’s worst nightmare' Judge Elgin Edwards . ‘Cheshire Police takes any allegations of sexual offences extremely seriously and would encourage anyone who has been a victim of this type of crime to contact police. Specialist trained officers are available to provide support throughout the investigation.’ Mason was immediately suspended as soon as allegations of sexual misconduct came to light. Also speaking following the court case, The Heath School principal Jamie Jardine said: ‘The Heath received a complaint from a pupil to whom Mr Mason had sent an inappropriate text. ‘The school referred the matter immediately to the local authority’s safeguarding committee and the police. Mr Mason was suspended by The Heath immediately and was interviewed by the police the same day. As a result of this, proceedings followed which have ended in his conviction. 'His employment with The Heath ended in June after his period of suspension. The Heath takes any issue regarding the safeguarding of children most seriously, as it did in this case, and was gratified to be complimented by the police on their handling of the matter when it first arose.'","Neil Mason, 28, from Cheshire, made sexual suggestions to schoolgirls .

Victims of the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti are suing the United Nations for billions of dollars in damages over claims it was triggered when sewage from infected peacekeepers was discharged into the water system. Human rights lawyers claim the epidemic, which has killed around 8,300 people and made more than 650,000 ill, came from contaminated waste from a UN barracks. Scientific studies have shown that the disease was likely introduced to the country by troops from Nepal, where the cholera is endemic. Forensic test linked the spread to a flawed sanitation system at the base, which contaminated a tributary that feeds Haiti’s largest river, which is used by Haitians for drinking and bathing. Demanding damages: Victims of the 2010 Haiti cholera outbreak (above) are suing the United Nations over claims it was caused by peacekeeping troops who brought the disease into the country from Nepal . The decision to file the lawsuit at a New York court comes after the UN said earlier this year that it would not pay compensation and insisted that it was immune from such claims. However, a UN official yesterday made a rare case for compensation for the victims. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay didn't say who she thought should pay, but activists have demanded the world body provide compensation to the victims of a disease believed brought in by U.N. peacekeepers. 'I have used my voice both inside the United Nations and outside to call for the right - for an investigation by the United Nations, by the country concerned, and I still stand by the call that victims of - of those who suffered as a result of that cholera be provided with compensation,' Pillay said at an awards ceremony for human rights activists in Geneva. Miserable: Doctors treat a boy for cholera in a Samaritan's Purse facility in November 2010 in Cabaret, Haiti . Pillay's remarks, streamed live on the Internet, were a rare admission by a U.N. official about the need to provide compensation. Lawyers are filing the suit in the U.S. District Court in New York's Southern District. The Boston-based Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti (IJDH), which has filed the suit, said in a statement: 'The plaintiffs include Haitians and Haitian Americans who contracted cholera themselves as well as family members of those who died of the disease.' Cholera is an acute intestinal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It . has a short incubation period, from less than one day to five days, and . produces an enterotoxin. Tthat causes a copious, painless, watery . diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if . treatment is not promptly given. Vomiting also occurs in most patients. An independent panel appointed by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to study the epidemic issued a 2011 . report that did not determine conclusively how the cholera was . introduced to Haiti. But the . U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that evidence . strongly suggested U.N. peacekeepers from Nepal were the source. Cholera is an infection causing severe diarrhea that can lead to dehydration and death. It occurs in places with poor sanitation. In November 2011, the IJDH filed a petition at UN headquarters in New York seeking a minimum of $100,000 for the families or next-of-kin of each person killed by cholera and at least $50,000 for each victim who suffered illness or injury from cholera. Ban's spokesman Martin Nesirky said in . February of this year that the world body advised the representatives of . the cholera victims that 'the claims are not receivable pursuant to . Section 29 of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities.' Outbreak: The lawsuit claims UN troops discharged contaminated sewage from a barracks . Under Section 29 the United Nations is required to make provisions for 'appropriate modes of settlement' of private law disputes to which the world body is a party or disputes involving a U.N. official who enjoys diplomatic immunity. The IJDH said at the time it was disappointed by the U.N. decision and would pursue the case in court. It was not immediately clear how the issue of diplomatic immunity for the United Nations would impact the lawsuit being being filed in the New York court. Ban launched a $2.2 billion initiative in December 2012 to stamp out cholera over the next decade in Haiti. The UN's Stabilization Mission in Haiti has been in operation since June 1, 2004, to assist with security in the politically volatile country following the resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. It has also been providing extensive assistance since the devastating earthquake of 12 January 2010, which resulted in more than 220,000 deaths.","Lawyers claim disease discharged into water system from UN barracks .

One of Australia’s most notorious criminals has died at the age of 58 after a battle with liver cancer. Mark ‘Chopper’ Read allegedly killed over a dozen people, but was never found guilty of murder, and instead rose to become a bestselling author whose life was turned into a big-hit movie. Read, who spent 23 years in prison for a variety of crimes including assault and armed robbery, wrote several books detailing his long career of violence, including one entitled ‘How to Shoot Friends and Influence People’. Scroll down for video . Life of crime: Mark 'Chopper' Read, a self-confessed killer and career criminal turned bestselling author, died of liver cancer aged 58 after refusing a transplant . Read became a ward of the state in his teens and was certified medically insane three times, aged 15, 19 and 23. Between the ages of 20 and 28, he only spent a total of 13 months outside prison gates, having been convicted of crimes including armed robbery, firearm offences, assault, arson, impersonating a police officer and kidnapping. He rose in the underworld by stealing from drug dealers and ‘targeting criminals’ by claiming debts they owed each other. He was known for torturing his victims with blowtorches, although he said in interviews he never hurt an innocent person. He once tried to kidnap a judge at gunpoint in a failed attempt to get a friend freed from prison. He claimed to have survived being stabbed, shot, run over by a car and beaten in the head with a hammer. Feared and famed: 'Chopper' Reid famously had his ears cut off in order to secure his removal from a prison ward and only spent 13 months in freedom from the age of 20 to 28 . Premonition: 'Chopper' acknowledged his terminal illness to his Twitter followers last month before he was taken to hospital . He gained international fame in 2000 after Australian-born actor Eric Bana played him in the film ‘Chopper’, a movie which launched the actors career. Read revealed in 2008 that he was suffering from liver cancer as a . ‘A fortnight ago, Mark made his last public appearance in front of a sold-out audience at Melbourne's Athenaeum Theatre,’ his manager, Andrew Parisi, said in a statement. ‘Despite his failing health, he delighted the audience with his skills as a raconteur and storyteller. This is how he would wish to be remembered, as someone who spun a great yarn and made many people laugh.’ Read was active on Twitter and had over 10,000 followers, to whom he posted a poignant message after his last performance stating ‘That was my last public appearance. That's all she wrote, ladies and gentlemen.’ On-screen criminal: The 2000 film about Read's life, entitled 'Chopper' launched actor Eric Bana's Hollywood career . Read’s suitable nickname is said to have hailed from a 1970s comicbook character, but he truly earned it during one of his prison stints when he asked a fellow inmate to cut his ears off. It was a drastic move, but a successful one as Read got his wish to get transferred to a different cell block. Although he claimed to have murdered 19 people, and attempted to kill a further 11, he was never convicted of the deeds. The closest he came to a murder conviction was a 1987 trial where he confessed to shooting and killing a man outside a nightclub in a Melbourne suburb, but he was acquitted on the grounds of self-defence. ‘If you're waiting for a heartfelt apology or a tearful rendition of Danny Boy, you'll be a long time waiting because I don't regret nothing I did. 'I don't regret my past,’ he told Andrew Denton in 2007. After he was released from prison for the final time in 1998, he transformed himself into a crime writer and painter, and spoke out against drunk driving and violence against women. ‘I know most of you out there may hate my guts - I'm not a very popular person,’ he once said in a drunk driving awareness commercial. ‘But you drink and you drive, you're a murdering maggot just the same as I am.’ Critics have accused ‘Chopper’ of exaggerating his crimes in a bid to gain publicity and build his reputation and Read himself once stated ‘I am not going to tell you what is true and what is not’. His crime novels sold over 500,000 copies and in 2002 he co-authored a children's book called Hooky The Cripple: The Grim Tale Of A Hunchback Who Triumphs. After an eight-year marriage to tax accountant Mary-Ann Hodge, mother of his oldest son Charlie, he married his long-term friend Margaret in 2003 and had son Charlie the same year. Read contracted Hepatitis C in prison, as a result of using a blood-stained razor – or so Read claimed himself. In 2008 he revealed that he had liver cancer and was in need of a transplant, but that he refused on the grounds that he did not deserve one. .I'm not going to ask for a liver transplant, it's not fair,’ he told ABC. ‘I'm 55 years old. I'm not going to put my name down against some 10-year-old kid.’ He was hospitalised last month, but after failing to recover he died Wednesday, survived by his wife and his two sons Brandon and Charlie.","Mark 'Chopper' read was one of Australia's most notorious criminals .

Police say their suspect has used a passport with a photo bearing a . striking resemblance to the 28-year-old Muslim convert but with the name . of a South African-born nurse, Natalie Faye Webb, 26, from Essex. Missing: Samantha Lewthwaite during her school days. Her family in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, say they have not seen her for several years . There are fears that up to 50 British . Islamic militants are receiving terrorist training in Kenya and . neighbouring Somalia, described by experts as a 'destination of choice' for would-be terrorists. Following the 7/7 bombings, . Lewthwaite described her husband's actions as 'abhorrent', and her family . are adamant she is not involved in terrorist activities. Her father Andy, 56, a builder and . former soldier, has begged his daughter to come home, saying 'Samantha . would not be involved in anything to do with terrorism. 'She was badly affected by what happened before and would have nothing to do with it. I am sure of that.' However the CIA, Scotland Yard and . anti-terror forces around the world are treating her capture as a huge . priority. Sources say she is 'no small fish' in terrorist circles, describing her role as a 'financier'. Another Londoner, Jermaine Grant, was . captured during the Mombasa raid on December 19, but Lewthwaite fled . the scene with a laptop and the bomb parts. Her escape was described as so extraordinary, that police are holding an internal probe to see if she had 'inside' help. Horrific: This was the carnage left onboard a train between King's Cross and Russell Square tube stations in London after a bomb blast during the July 7 attacks . Kenyan police say the woman they are hunting fled the gang’s hideout . before they raided the house, where more than 60 rounds of . AK47 ammunition and other weapons were discovered. Grant, 29, of Newham, East . London, was arrested. He has been charged with possessing bomb-making . equipment and conspiring to cause an explosion and is due to go on trial . in May over what sources call a ‘serious’ terrorist plot. Police are also searching for terror suspect Habib Ghani, 26, from . Hounslow, West London, who is understood to have fled with the woman and . her children. The dramatic disclosure came after a briefing from officials in Nairobi, . who believe the woman may still be in Kenya. Police spokesman Erick . Kiraithe said: ‘We know quite a bit about her now. She had three . identities in the past and that [Samantha Lewthwaite] is one possible . identity. Our expectation is that our counter-terror team should be able . to locate her soon.’ Location: Lewthwaite fled before the raid in Mombasa, and police are hunding for her in Nairobi, located 200 miles away, as well as across the border . Muslim convert Samantha Lewthwaite pictured with King's Cross bomber Jermaine Lindsay . Police say they will not confirm the woman they are searching for is . Miss Lewthwaite until she is captured because it is possible her . identity could have been stolen. Yesterday Miss Lewthwaite’s family, . in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, said they have not seen her ‘for years’ but believed she was in South Africa. Her uncle Nigel Lewthwaite, 51, said he understood she had married again, to another Muslim man. He said: ‘Her father only found out . that she’d had another child when she left this country. He just isn’t . in contact with her. I don’t know anybody in her family who is. ‘Her father thought she was in South . Africa, but we don’t know. We don’t even know when she left the country. Apparently she’s married another Muslim man and her father thought she . was in South Africa.' Miss Lewthwaite converted to Islam at the age of 15 and married . unemployed carpet fitter Lindsay in 2002. Three years later, while she . was seven months pregnant with their second child, Jamaican-born Lindsay . detonated his rucksack bomb on a Piccadilly Line train, killing 26 of . the 52 who died in the July 7 bombings. She later issued the statement . saying the attacks were ‘abhorrent’. The Metropolitan Police has sent a team to the Kenyan capital to assist . in the hunt, which comes amid mounting concern over the number of . British extremists going to Kenya and Somalia, which officials now . regard as the ‘destination of choice’ for would-be terrorists. There are fears some militants could return to carry out attacks in the . UK after receiving training in Somalia from the Al Qaeda-linked al . Shabaab rebel group. Convert: Mother-of-three Samantha Lewthwaite . As a teenage Home Counties schoolgirl, Samantha Lewthwaite wore make-up and pretty dresses and went to parties with her friends. But by the time she was 17, the soldier’s daughter had converted to Islam, was covering her hair in a hijab, changed her name to Asmantara, and was readying herself to marry the man who would go on to take part in the 7/7 attacks. The youngest of three children, Miss Lewthwaite was born in Banbridge, County Down, in 1983 to Christine and soldier Andrew, who was serving in Northern Ireland. Her parents moved to Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, but separated when she was 11. Friends say she sought comfort in Islam after being badly affected by the split. After learning about the Muslim faith in religious studies lessons at school, the teenager told friends she was converting. Within two years, she was wearing the jilbab, the long gown that covers everything but the hands and face. While studying for a degree in religion and politics at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London she met Jamaican-born Jermaine Lindsay, a fellow Muslim convert, through an Islamic chatroom. In October 2002 they married in an Islamic ceremony in Aylesbury. In 2004 their first son was born, which is when she says her husband first started to spend time at radical mosques in London, Luton and Yorkshire. She has said she believes his mind was poisoned by these visits because before this he had been a ‘peaceful man’.","CIA joins man-hunt to stop 'British extremist' Samantha Lewthwaite .

Reflecting on his life after a near-fatal stroke, Andrew Marr believes he may have taken 'a wrong fork in the path' and wishes he had trained as an artist instead of going into journalism . He is one of the BBC’s most prominent and popular broadcasters, but Andrew Marr says he may have chosen the wrong career. Reflecting . on his life after a near-fatal stroke, he believes he may have taken ‘a . wrong fork in the path’ and wishes he had trained as an artist instead . of going into journalism. The . 54-year-old father-of-three – who admitted being a workaholic before . his illness in January – has recently returned to presenting the Andrew . Marr show on a Sunday morning. He . has made a number of changes to his life following his stroke and . revealed he now draws regularly in the week and the time spent doing . this was the equivalent of praying to him. Speaking . about his love of drawing at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, he . said: ‘I might have been a happier man if I had gone to art school,' describing the decision as ‘a wrong fork in the path I think probably’. Mr . Marr said as a young man he was given the opportunity of studying art . in Edinburgh, but chose to read English at Cambridge instead. He . draws for a couple of hours three or four times a week, he said, which . helped him take time out from his busy life to find ‘space’. ‘When I draw I’m doing something similar to when people pray,’ he said. ‘We need time to get away.’ He described art as ‘a primal need’. ‘It is not a modern affectation,’ he added. But he is unimpressed by modern art, saying the art world ‘has gone mad’. ‘An absolutely absurd, and I think obscene, amount of money is being spent on these artists,’ he said. Mr . Marr did not elaborate on which artists he was talking about, but said . he thought his friend David Hockney was ‘about the only one’ who could . draw. Mr Marr, seen here (left) interviewing Nigel Farage, recently returned to the Andrew Marr show after his stroke in January . He said the only . good thing about modern art being about ‘3D’ and ‘installations’ was . that ‘the rest of us can reclaim drawing and reclaim painting without . having to be part of the art world’. Mr Marr walked on stage at the festival with some difficulty but without the aid of a stick. He wore trainers with his blue suit to make it easier for him. Asked . about his recovery from his stroke, Mr Marr said he was making progress . thanks to physiotherapy - but only because he could afford to pay for . private sessions. ‘I’m . very, very lucky because I have got the money to pay for physio and . help, and you do need a lot,’ he said. ‘A lot of people do not (have the . money).’ He explained . he had met dozens of people who have had strokes since his . hospitalisation and that many had not been given the physiotherapy they . needed to be able to lead normal lives again. Mr Marr interviewed Home Secretary Theresa May on Sunday as he returned to Andrew Marr show . ‘We are brilliant in this country at saving people’s lives - we then chuck them out,’ he said. ‘It’s crazy economically because if you gave them the physio early on they could get back to work quickly and pay taxes.’ He called for a national scheme to help people who did not have the means to pay for physiotherapy to get the help they need. Last . year, Mr Marr’s marriage to Guardian journalist Jackie Ashley came . under pressure when he was pictured putting his hand down a female . colleague’s trousers during an intimate late-night clinch. However he has now pledged to be a Beta male and a better family man.","Andrew Marr reveals he turned down chance to train as an artist .

The devastating fire that engulfed part of a Jersey shore boardwalk and dozens of businesses was caused by wiring that was damaged by Hurricane Sandy. The Seaside Park, New Jersey boardwalk emerged relatively unscathed from the October 29 storm compared to its neighbor Seaside Heights. But Sandy left her indelible mark after all, last Thursday when a raging fire blazed through 80 buildings across three blocks of the resort town. The fire began at a frozen custard stand, where aged wiring that had been compromised by salt water and sand sparked what would eventually become an inferno, federal and county investigators said at a Tuesday news conference. Still damaging: Authorities said Tuesday that the massive boardwalk fire was accidental and linked it to electrical wiring and equipment that was compromised by Superstorm Sandy . The wind-whipped blaze destroyed more than 50 businesses in the two towns. Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph Coronato said the fire should be a cautionary tale and prompt coastal property owners to inspect their own equipment for similar danger. ‘I'm sure on every boardwalk everywhere (at the Jersey shore), there may be compromised wiring,’ he said. ‘We don't want to start a panic mode. We just want to be reasonable. If you're a property owner and you think your electrical work came in contact with water and sand, we strongly recommend you have it inspected.’ Seaside Heights officials did not immediately return a message seeking comment about the status of wiring in the surviving two-thirds of the boardwalk. Before the flames: Kohr's is pictured before 1970s-era wiring damaged by Hurricane Sandy sparked a 10-alarm-plus inferno . No work today: Several employees of Kohrs Frozen Custard viewed the remaining ashes of Funtown Pier at Seaside Park boardwalk. The fire was started by faulty wiring in the custard shop last Thursday . Aftermath: The sign for Funtown Pier stands above charred rubble in Seaside Park, New Jersey after the devastating fire last Thursday ripped through the resort town and destroyed some 80 buildings . Depressing: The area was hard hit by Hurricane Sandy, though this particular boardwalk had until now avoided the devastation the storm wreaked on other areas . Investigators said the fire began in wiring that dated to the 1970s and was located under a frozen custard stand and candy shop. Jessica Gotthold, a senior special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said investigators located wires under the boardwalk that somehow came in contact with each other, causing an electrical arc that is believed to have started the fire. Coronato said those wires had been exposed to the storm surge and grating sand action of the storm, which compromised them. But as far as why the wires contacted each other, he said, ‘we will never know.’The prosecutor said the investigation ruled out all other possible causes of the fire, including careless smoking or a deliberate act of arson. The wiring was inaccessible to the public, he noted.Authorities even pulled financial records of the businesses involved in the blaze to make sure no one had a financial motive to start a fire. Inferno: Firefighters are seen pulling back Thursday afternoon during the height of the inferno, which at one point became too hot to approach . War zone: This aerial photo shows aftermath of a massive fire that burned a large portion of the Seaside Park boardwalk. The fire, which apparently started in an ice cream shop and spread several blocks . Ruined: The Music Sound shop was one of dozens of businesses reduced to rubble in Seaside Park after Thursday's tragic fire . Catching a break: A 25-foot fire break was smashed into the boardwalk near where Seaside Park meets Seaside Heights, largely sparing the neighboring town from the fire that ravaged Seaside Park . Can't get a break: Seaside Heights got its facelift just days before beach season began but now a black, burnt scar will mar its close neighbor Seaside Park . After Sandy: Workers replace the boardwalk in Seaside Heights destroyed by the superstorm in 2012. Unlike its neighbor, Seaside Park's adjoining boardwalk was untouched by the storm. Now, it is Seaside Park's turn to suffer . ‘We left no stone unturned,’ he said. ‘This was not a suspicious fire.’ It . was only by destroying part of the 5-month-old boardwalk that Seaside . Heights had just spent $8 million to rebuild that the rest of the . walkway was saved. Public works crews ripped out a 25-foot swath of . boardwalk to serve as a makeshift fire break, depriving the blaze of . fuel. They then filled the void with giant sand piles — makeshift dunes . to hold back fire, not water. The desperation plan worked and stopped the fire from burning the rest of the boardwalk.Gov. Chris Christie's administration decided the state will use . Sandy-recovery money to pay for debris removal. He also pledged $15 . million in Sandy money to help rebuild the burned businesses. Christie . said Tuesday the state will let business affected by the fire postpone . filing sales and use tax returns that were due this month until October . to help them recover.

The explosive revelation threatens to destroy Mr Salmond's claims that a separate Scotland could use its oil wealth to transform the economy . A devastating private dossier for SNP ministers has sparked warnings that independence could trigger higher taxes or deeper spending cuts. Internal briefing documents, seen by the Scottish Daily Mail, expose the huge risks in Alex Salmond’s flagship policy to put North Sea oil revenues in a savings account for the future. The explosive revelation threatens to destroy Mr Salmond’s claims that a separate Scotland could use its oil wealth to transform the economy. One of the papers, written by a top economic adviser to the government, explains that Scotland ran a deficit for 20 of the last 21 years – even during the boom years. If Scotland had been independent throughout that period, the expert states that oil revenues would have been required to fund vital public services such as the NHS, schools and policing. The analysis, written for ministers in March last year but only published now under Freedom of Information legislation, concludes: 'Given Scotland’s fiscal position since 1990, if the Scottish Government had adopted any of these rules in the past there would have had to be an accompanying reduction in public spending, increase in taxation or higher borrowing to ensure that the public finances continued to balance.' The publication of the private papers comes only days after the Scottish Government’s fiscal commission working group released a public report that recommended the creation of an oil fund. Last week, Finance Secretary John Swinney said the ‘economic rationale’ for a fund is ‘powerful’ and he went on to blast Westminster for failing to put aside oil revenues in past decades. Yesterday, a government spokesman insisted that a separate Scotland would be running a budget surplus before investments are made into a savings fund. But former Chancellor Alistair Darling – chairman of the pro-Union Better Together campaign – yesterday accused the SNP of trying to ‘deceive’ voters. 'Last week they said they could set up an oil fund at no cost,' he said. 'It is now clear that their own private advice says that there would need to be tax rises, spending cuts or more borrowing – or all three. The SNP have quite deliberately set out to deceive the Scottish public. 'This internal SNP paper also confirms that, in all but one of the last 20 years, all the oil money has been spent on public services in Scotland yet SNP ministers tell us it’s just a bonus and not the basis of our economy. 'Scotland doesn’t have to be faced with . this choice. Being part of the UK means we have the strength of a bigger . economy without the risk of oil volatility.' Thousands of pro-independence campaigners march through Edinburgh on September 21,2013 . Women are a 'key barrier' to Alex Salmond's dream of independence, according to new research. Analysis by the non-partisan What Scotland Thinks organisation has found that 66 per cent of women are likely to vote No in next year's referendum, based on latest polling figures. That compares to 53 per cent of men, using data from various polls carried out between July and September. The 'gender divide' suggests women are less willing to give credence to Mr Salmond's claims. What Scotland Thinks states: 'The uncertainty about independence felt by women is a key barrier to a Yes vote.' Norway set up its own oil fund in 1990 and currently has around £450billion put aside - making it the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world. In contrast, the UK government – in line with other large nations such as the US – spends the money it raises through offshore taxes on public the services and uses it to keep personal taxes low. According to the government’s Fiscal Commission Working Group in a report to SNP ministers last week, money could start being put into an oil fund within a year of independence. However, the private document written last March by Simon Fuller of the fiscal analysis team in the Office of the Chief Economic Adviser states: 'There has only been one year since 1990 when tax receipts have exceeded total public spending. 'This suggests that over this period . North Sea receipts would have been required to fund public services in . Scotland. Therefore if the Scottish Government had wished to establish . an oil fund, it would have had to reduce public spending, increase . taxation or increase public sector borrowing.' A . second paper for ministers, with no named author or date, adds: 'There . is likely to be significant demand, at least in the years immediately . following independence, to use any additional resources to support . public services and reduce public sector debt rather than investing in . an oil fund.' North sea oil revenues would have to be spent on essential public services, the report states . Last night, a Scottish Government spokesman claimed the papers ‘confirm exactly what we have said on this issue’. 'As the Finance Secretary has said, the assumption that Scotland would have to run an absolute surplus before investing in an oil savings fund ""has been reflected in the Scottish Government’s early thinking on the subject"", he said. 'However, these papers have been overtaken by the expert report of the Fiscal Commission Working Group, who have recommended that an independent Scotland should set up a stabilisation fund and a longer term oil savings fund. 'Based on the model outlined by the working group, Scotland could consider investing modest sums into a long-term savings fund without an offsetting change to public spending or taxation potentially as early as 2017-18.' He added: 'Oil is the bonus rather than the basis for an independent Scotland’s economy.'","Reports cast doubt on Salmond's claims that oil will transform economy .

He said the website's success allowed him to leave his MTV job just two months after it launched, and is now his main income source. He had also previously worked for social network Bebo. The entrepreneur added: ‘I think it's opened my eyes to how sex is definitely very readily available - and S***  At Uni proves that. I don't think it's changed me personally.

Drugs including poppy straw and morphine have been found aboard a Greenpeace ship whose crew were detained for protesting against Arctic oil drilling, Russian authorities claimed today. The illegal 'narcotics' were discovered after armed officials boarded the vessel as environmental activists attempted to scale an oil platform  in the remote Pechora Sea in the Russian Arctic. Teams from the Russian coastguard . abseiled onto the Arctic Sunrise from helicopters and arrested 30 crew members, including six UK nationals, last month. Scroll down for video . Russian authorities seize the Greenpeace ship the Arctic Sunrise and detain the crew following a protest by activists at a Russian oil platform. The group has since been held on piracy . charges although officials claimed today that given 'new evidence' of . drugs being found on the ship the charges could now be 'modified.' In a statement published on Russia's Investigative Committee website, a body equivalent to the FBI, spokesman Vladimir Markin said 'narcotic substances (probably poppy straw and morphine) were . confiscated during the search on the ship.' He added that 'the origin of these substances and their purpose are being investigated' and warned that charges already brought against the Greenpeace activists could be . altered. 'Taking into consideration the data received in the course of the . investigation of the criminal case, the charge already filed against . everyone is set to be adjusted,' a statement said. 'It's obvious to the investigation that a number of individuals will be charged with committing other grave crimes.' Poppy straw, the husk left after ripe poppy seeds are extracted from the plant, is a raw material that can be used for . illegally producing heroin or morphine. It is recognised as a narcotic substance, . the possession, sale, purchase or use of which without a valid license is against Russian law. The Greenpeace ship, centre, is anchored side by side with a Russian Coastguard vessel. Today, Greenpeace flatly denied any possibility of there being illegal drugs on board their vessel. But in comments likely to further escalate the row between Russia and the Netherlands, where the Arctic Sunrise is registered, Russian authorities also hinted at the possibility of banning the import of Dutch tulips and dairy products into the country. The head of Russia's veterinary and . plant monitoring service revealed an ongoing audit of Dutch dairy products had 'been unsatisfactory'. Sergei Dankvert also accused his Dutch . counterparts of approving the safety of dairy produce 'without seeing . the product' as well as improperly labelling exports. Separately, Mr Dankvert's spokesman, Alexei . Alexeyenko, claimed Russia had additional problems with the quality of Dutch tulips and other flowers the country . has been exporting across Europe for many centuries. 'We are not only talking about flowers but also... planting material,' he told Russian News Service radio. 'In other words, we are talking about a full range of products imported from the Netherlands,' he added. Russia has often been accused of . using trade as a diplomatic weapon. On Monday it banned dairy imports from Lithuania, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, following the Baltic state's . attempt to draw ex-Soviet countries such as Ukraine closer to the . 28-nation bloc. Tensions with the Netherlands first . surfaced last week when the country filed a legal case against Russia's . arrest of the crew of the  Arctic Sunrise in September. Greenpeace claim the vessel was illegally . seized by former KGB agents from the FSB secret service in international . waters, 1245 miles north of Moscow above the Arctic Circle. The activists - who come from 18 . countries including the United States - all face jail terms of up to 15 years. The entire crew has been placed in pre-trial detention for two . months by Russian authorities pending an investigation by 'detectives and criminal experts'. Relations deteriorated further yesterday when Russia accused the Netherlands of illegally detaining . a top Moscow diplomat in The Hague over allegations of domestic abuse. Russian authorities now claim they have discovered illegal drugs during a search of the Greenpeace vessel. Russian President Vladimir Putin . called the detention at the weekend of diplomat Dmitry Borodin 'the most . gross breach of the Vienna Convention' and demanded a formal apology. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations grants diplomats immunity from arrest. The Dutch side responded by saying it was . investigating the incident and would only apologise 'if the . investigation shows that this was handled in a way that contravened the . Vienna Convention'. Today, a spokesman for Greenpeace said Russian claims that illegal drugs were found on board its ship were 'a fabrication, pure and simple.' A statement on its website read: 'Before leaving Norway for the Russian . Arctic, the ship was searched with a sniffer dog by the Norwegian . authorities, as is standard. 'The laws in Norway are amongst the . strictest in the world, and nothing was found because nothing illegal . was on the ship.' A source for the campaign group added: 'Any claim that something other than medical supplies was found should be regarded with great suspicion. Nothing was found because nothing illegal was on the ship.' Last week Russian officials charged 28 activists and two journalists who were on board the Arctic Sunrise with piracy. The Kremlin did not initially respond to a demand by Greenpeace chief Kumi Naidoo who called for meeting with President Putin and offered to travel to Russia and remain in the country as security if his campaigners were released.","Poppy straw and morphine alleged to have been discovered .

Ministers are drawing up secret plans to sweep away energy quangocrats appointed by Ed Miliband in an increasingly bitter battle over how best to keep down spiralling gas and electricity bills. The plan to shake up energy regulator Ofgem comes as the Tories seek to up the pressure on the Labour leader, blaming him for price rises that have hit consumers in recent years. Senior Tories also want to rein in some of the green levies that Mr Miliband introduced as Energy Secretary to help cut prices, though they face a fierce battle with their Liberal Democrat coalition colleagues. Energy Minister Greg Barker, left, is drawing up secret plans to sweep away energy quangocrats appointed by Ed Miliband . David Cameron told MPs yesterday that Mr Miliband’s pledge to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins the next election is nothing more than a gimmick, claiming his plans to set yet more environmental targets would add £125 a year on to bills. The Daily Mail has learned that Energy Minister Greg Barker is now preparing plans for a fundamental overhaul of Ofgem, which has been criticised for failing to get tough with the big six energy companies as they have hiked up prices. Government sources said that six of the nine current members of the Ofgem board were appointed by the last government, and only one has a consumer background. Those appointed by Mr Miliband when he was Energy Secretary include John Howard, formerly at the BBC; David Frisk, former Departmental Chief Scientist at the then Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions; Jim Keohane, former non-executive director at the Civil Aviation Authority and director at East Midlands Electricity and Sarah Harrison, former director of corporate affairs at Ofgem and previously at telephone services regulator ICSTIS. The Labour leader has now pledged to scrap Ofgem and replace it with a new regulator. But one Government source said: ‘Ed Miliband appears to be saying he doesn’t trust his own judgement and now wants to change the nameplate on the door of Ofgem. We need to sweep away all of the Labour appointees and bring in people that actually understand the consumer. ‘They are in the main professional quangocrats and industry insiders. When Ed Miliband had the chance, as Energy Secretary under the last government, he did absolutely nothing to advance the interests of the people paying energy bills. ‘We need people from Which?, people with a supermarket background, people who’ve worked at the retail end of the sector. We don’t need technocrats, we need people who will really take action.’ In the Commons, the Prime Minister attacked Mr Miliband’s promise to freeze prices for 20 months after the next general election, telling MPs that even the Labour leader admitted he may not be able to keep to his commitment because no Government could control the wholesale energy markets. He claimed that if Mr Miliband did introduce the price freeze, it would only lead to higher energy costs for households and businesses in the long-term. ‘This isn’t a policy, it’s a gimmick and the reason it’s a gimmick is that you are in favour of a decarbonisation target that would add £125 to everybody’s bill. It is obvious why you want to talk about the cost of living, because you do not have an economic policy. ‘Energy prices doubled under Labour, electricity prices went up by 50 per cent. And let me say this to you - there is one thing governments can’t control and that is the international wholesale price of gas. ‘I know you would like to live in some sort of Marxist universe where you can control all of these things but you need a basic lesson in economics.’ Prime Minister David Cameron told Mr Miliband he needs a 'basic lesson in economics' Mr Miliband insisted the Government had no answer to Labour’s policy to freeze energy prices, which was unveiled last month at the party’s conference in Brighton. The Labour leader said the Government’s policy to force firms to switch consumers to the lowest energy tariff would not help 90 per cent of the population because it would only apply to those on so-called ‘closed tariffs’, those that are no longer available. He told Mr Cameron: ‘What is clear is that you are floundering around and you have no answer to Labour’s energy price freeze. You have no idea. You say you want to bring energy prices down but can you confirm that energy prices have gone up by £300 since you became Prime Minister? ‘We have a cost of living crisis in this country. Energy bills are rising and you support energy companies and not the consumer. We have a Prime Minister who always stands up for the wrong people.’ Mr Cameron replied by reviving the Tories’ 1992 election warning that a Labour victory would mean tax rises and higher mortgage bills: ‘We know what your cost of living policy is. It is more spending, more borrowing and more debt and that would lead to higher taxes and higher mortgage rates. That is the double-whammy that would hit every family in this country.’ A spokesman for the Energy Department claimed Mr Miliband’s figures were ‘misleading’. ‘Before the end of the year, energy suppliers will be forced to offer no more than four core tariffs per fuel,’ he said. ‘As these changes take effect, more people will be on tariffs closed to new customers, and suppliers will need to move these customers on to the best deal for their preferences. ‘Suppliers will also be required to tell all their own customers if there is a cheaper tariff for them, and people will benefit from clearer information to help them compare and switch suppliers.’ The Government is preparing further measures on the cost of living in the coming weeks. Yesterday, ministers promised to cap rail fare increases and there is speculation that they may order a real-terms freeze next year. Other proposals to limit bank charges and water bills are expected. An Ofgem spokesman said: ‘We do not comment on speculation.’","Energy Minister Greg Barker reportedly preparing Ofgem overhaul .

Incidents like this demonstrate the requirement for the Accord to be effective, and for all members to work in collaboration for sustainable change in Bangladesh.' The MailOnline has also contacted Gap and Morrisons. Action: The 10 people who were killed in the fire were working overtime according to local reports.

Next said it used supplier Marina Garments, which had sourced fabric from the Aswad Unit One Mill. A . spokesman added: 'As the cause of the fire is unknown, it is not clear . whether any audit would have prevented this tragedy.  Once the cause is . known, as routine NEXT will review its procedures, including the extent . to which it needs to look further down the supply chain - particularly . in high risk areas such as Bangladesh.' George at Asda confirmed it was looking into its involvement. The . blaze at the Aswad garment factory in Gazipur, just outside Dhaka, took . firefighters 10 hours to bring under control early this morning. The . cause of the fire is not yet known but reports coming out of Asia . suggested it may have started in the knitting section of the building . wen a faulty machine exploded. It . has been reported that the factory had recently produced clothes for . Western retailers, including the American Wal-Mart chain. The Wall Street Journal also . reported that it had in the past produced clothes for the Canadian Joe . Fresh label, and Hudson's Bay Co. according to online . shipping sites. A spokesman for Hudson's Bay said its last shipment from . the factory was in April. It had subsequently decided not to use the factory anymore, but would not be drawn on why. Loblaw said it . was looking into it, and Wal-Mart said it was 'working . to understand the facts and will take appropriate action based on our . findings.' The Bangladeshi government confirmed they have launched an investigation. Fire officer Zafar Ahmed confirmed that factory general manager Rashiduzzaman Mandal was among the fatalities. According to the director of the factory, Emdad Hossain, . 170 workers of the factory's 3,000 strong workforce were inside when the blaze took hold. It is believed that those killed were working overtime. District administrator Dilruba Khanom . said that emergency services were waiting until sunrise to complete . their search of the factory. They warned that the number of casualties . could rise. He said: 'They have managed to control the fire in most parts . of the factory, but the warehouse is still burning. The . bodies are charred beyond recognition.' The Bangladeshi clothes production industry, which is the third largest in the world, has come under heavy criticism after a string of workplace disasters in recent years. Last November, 112 workers were killed in a fire at another clothes warehouse close to Dhaka. In that incident, it was reported that workers were unable to escape because there were not enough emergency exits in the building where they were working, with some having to leap to from windows. The fire broke out on the ground floor of the building and spread quickly to the upper floors but all three exit staircases led to the engulfed bottom level. At the time, one expert claimed that, had there been at least one emergency exit through outside the casualties would have been much lower. Major Western brands including Disney and Sears were said to have been among the companies having their products manufactured there. The collapse of the eight-storey Rana . Plaza in Savar in April this year prompted more protests and calls for . improved safety measures. As a result of that tragedy, international retailers such as Primark agreed to conduct inspections at factories from which their goods were sourced. Bangladesh earns $20 billion a year from garment exports, mainly to the United States and Europe. The sector employs about 4 million workers, mostly women. An engineering survey shown to The Associated Press after the Rana Plaza collapse showed many Bangladesh garment factories added floors that the building foundations couldn't support and were located in converted residential buildings not designed to withstand use of heavy equipment.","Next, Primark, George, Gap, H&M, and Morrisons named .

A social worker failed to raise the alarm when she was warned a 12-year-old girl had been claiming she had sex with her mother’s boyfriend, a hearing was told. Diane Onyango was contacted by the girl’s school after she was heard discussing her alleged abuse with her friend and exhibiting sexual behaviour, the Health Care Professions Council heard. Onyango, who was employed by Haringey Council, north London, reportedly knew the youngster, referred to as Child B, was registered as a child in need with social services but failed to alert anyone. Lisa Blundell, a manager at the time, said that Onyango should have contacted a manager as a matter of urgency. ‘School had passed information to us on the phone that should have raised absolute alarm bells,’ she said. Miss Blundell said Onyango did not raise the school’s concerns for almost a week. Onyango allowed child B’s mother to have telephone contact with her daughter and told her of the sexual abuse allegations, failing to recognise that the mother may have been complicit in the abuse. In a second case involving a two-year-old child who may have been at risk of abuse, Onyango failed to visit the home every two weeks, it was said. The child lived in a home where there had been domestic violence and had suffered a fractured arm. On 29 June 2010, the mother of the child was reported to have a large bruise on her arm but Onyango failed to follow this up with managers. Onyango was employed at Haringey Council between 20 October 2008 and 14 December 2011. She admits many of the allegations made against her but denies having failed to inform her manager immediately.

Distressing footage has been released showing a horse thrashing around in a hotel lobby after it escaped from its owner. The disorientated animal can be seen trying to get into a lift and turning round in circles after it went into the Best Western Maypole Hotel in Birmingham. It appears to be having difficulty with staying upright on the slippery tiles of the hotel lobby where it knocked over plants and kicked dents in the walls. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Horseplay: The runaway nag was captured on CCTV after it found its way into Best Western's lobby . Guests who were staying at Best . Western Maypole Hotel ran for cover when the horse, which had escaped . from a nearby field, ran in through the . glass sliding doors at the entrance to the hotel. Moments . earlier, it had been seen bolting across the car park of a nearby . store, dodging attempts along the way to lasso it with a tow rope. The horse, which was limping and sweating, was finally snared when West Midlands Police arrived on the scene. Officers brought the horse under control and returned it to its owner, but sadly the animal later had to be put down. Heather Thornton, director of sales at the hotel, said: 'I saw two police officers when I arrived at 9.50am and there were a lot of people standing around the hotel looking bemused. 'The horse tried to get into the lift and then it reversed out again. It was stressed and frightened. 'It . did a lot of damage to the lobby.

Elevator going up: As the doors to the lift open the runaway horse tries to get inside . The horse had earlier run past a nearby Halfords store and escaped the clutches of duty manager Jay Gordhan. The 36-year-old said: 'A customer walked in asking if anyone had seen a horse. Just then, it appeared and ran around the car park. 'I was worried about our customers and any kids who may have been walking so I grabbed one of our tow ropes and tried to throw it over the horse. 'But it ran into the Best Western and smashed up a bit of their lobby. I told one of the girls to throw it some fruit to keep it there.' The horse then made its way to a Wilkinson hardware shop and a Sainsbury’s supermarket. No place to hide: The cramped environs of the lift were too small for the distressed nag, which backs out . Mr Gordhan added: 'Wilkinson have a glass window and it must have been confused thinking it was another horse.

Announcement: Vince Cable admitted that the 700,000 figure was in fact a 'very rough estimate' More than 700,000 private investors have applied for shares in Royal Mail – in a rush that could leave many people empty-handed. The controversial privatisation has been over-subscribed nearly seven times over, it was announced yesterday. Business Secretary Vince Cable told MPs his ‘very rough estimate’ was that 700,000 private investors signed up for shares before the midnight deadline on Tuesday. The total number is expected to rise even higher, possibly to 750,000, as some postal applications have not yet been included in the figure. Dr Tim May, chief executive of the Wealth Management Association which represents small shareholders, said: ‘It is clear that small investors should be the backbone of Royal Mail plc. Governments have been elected on smaller majorities than 700,000. ‘These investors will demand and expect fair play when the final allocation is made.’ Ian Gorham, chief executive of Hargreaves Lansdown, one of the authorised brokers, said the demand for shares highlights the ‘real appetite for private share ownership and investing’ in Britain. And Tom Stevenson, from investment giant Fidelity, said: ‘It has been many years since investors have been so excited about an IPO [a flotation, also known as an initial public offering].’ On Monday Business Minister Michael Fallon said he was ‘committed to making sure small investors get their fair share’. But he confirmed that around 70 per cent of the Government’s shares will be reserved for big investors such as  hedge funds, leaving only ‘around 30 per cent’ for small private investors. It is still not clear how shares will be divided between members of the public who sign up to the flotation. Earlier this week, Chris Stevenson, . vice-president of Barclays Stockbrokers, another authorised broker, said . the ‘vast majority’ had asked for more than the minimum of £750. Delicate delivery: Given the sensitivity around the privitisation the final decision as to how to divide up the shares may end up being made by the Prime Minister . One option is for everybody to be given £750 of shares. People who applied for more than this might be given a percentage of the extra amount. For example, if they applied for £10,000 of shares, they also could get 20 per cent of £9,250. Given the political sensitivity of the privatisation, the final decision might end up being made by the Prime Minister, sources said last night. Meanwhile, Royal Mail’s executives and other staff will get priority over members of the public, under the ‘employee priority offer’. Chief executive Moya Greene and ten other directors have applied for a total of £500,000 of shares, according to the company’s prospectus. Under the deal, they will pay the same price as other retail investors – between £2.60 and £3.30 per share – but will ‘receive priority on up to the first £10,000 of shares applied for’. Yesterday Mr Cable warned the Canadian . boss, who currently earns £1.5million a year, that she will have to show . ‘appropriate restraint’ over her pay package after the State-owned . giant is privatised. Staff benefits: All Royal Mail employees will be eligible for a chunk of free shares in the company and could stand to make a substantial profit . Speaking to MPs on the Business Committee, he urged Miss Greene and her fellow directors to resist the temptation of rapidly escalating their pay – or face the Government trying to block their pay packages as a minority shareholder. He also rejected accusations that shares are being sold cheaply, insisting that the price range was ‘entirely sensible and robust’. He said the decision had been made after extensive consultation with the City. Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, then confronted him over the type of institutional investor who will be allowed to buy shares. He read out one of Mr Cable’s previous quotes, which said: ‘Why should good companies be destroyed by short-term investors looking for a speculative killing while their accomplices in the City make fat fees?’ But Mr Cable insisted attempts are being made to freeze such ‘spivs and speculators’ out of the flotation, and focus instead on ‘responsible, long-term institutional investors’.","But the figure could still rise as Vince Cable calls it a 'very rough estimate'

Greedy: Sara Beale pictured leaving court today after pleading guilty to stealing more than £10,00 from her elderly father . A daughter stole more than £10,000 from her frail father as he battled Alzheimer’s in a nursing home - to fund her online gambling addiction. Sara Beale, 45, blew the cash on shopping and ‘evil’ internet betting rather than her 70-year-old father Brian Beale’s care, a court heard. Beale, who regularly withdrew money from her father’s account over 10 months, has walked free from court after pleading guilty to theft. He initially received respite care at home for his health problems, including Alzheimer’s disease, Southampton Crown Court heard. But his behaviour became difficult to manage and it was arranged that he would move into a home full time. Beale - who has a young son herself - met with social services and the home and agreed to pay £158 a week from her dad’s funds to cover costs. But no money arrived and she later wrote a letter to social services saying she was no longer responsible for his finances and he should be invoiced.

Two sisters stole funeral wreaths from a grave hours after a pensioner's funeral to sell them on to other grieving families, a court has heard. Marion Hill and Lyndsay Millett face jail after they were caught on CCTV taking the wreaths from a grave at Springwood Crematorium in Liverpool and putting them in the back of a hire car. They insisted that they intended to put the wreaths on their own mother's grave at the nearby Allerton Cemetery. But when police searched the Speke home of Hill, 41, they found it was packed full of black condolence cards, wreath stands and what Liverpool Magistrates' Court was told was 'wreath-making paraphenalia'. Callous: Marion Hill, left, and Lyndsay Millett, right, leave Liverpool Magistrates' Court after a hearing heard that she and her sister stole flowers from a pensioner's grave just hours after she was buried . Officers also discovered seven wreaths, including one bearing the word 'Dad', and a Winnie the Pooh photo album packed with various pictures of floral tribute arrangements was found. Prosecutors believe that the sisters were stealing the wreaths to run a macabre 'commercial venture'. The wreaths that they had been caught  taking from the Springwood Crematorium on May 7, one forming the word 'Mum' and the other 'Nan', were also found. They had been stolen just hours after the funeral earlier that day of Bridget Jannet. Mrs Jannet's son Chris, who attended yesterday's hearing, said he had been devastated when he discovered the two wreaths, covered in blue and white flowers, as well as a bunch of roses, had gone. Mr Jannet, from Anfield, added: 'This incident has left me shocked to the core to think somebody could commit such a callous act.' The court was told that when Hill was initially arrested, she told police 'I'm admitting it'. Macabre: When police searched the Speke home of Hill, 41, they found it was packed full of black condolence cards, wreath stands and what Liverpool Magistrates Court, pictured, was told was 'wreath-making paraphenalia' Later she and sister Millett, 37, also of Speke, maintained the flowers were intended to go on their late mother's grave. CCTV showed the pair arriving at the crematorium in a black Land Rover which had been hired by Hill, who was seen to run out, pick up the wreaths and stash them in the back. She told the court she had hired the car for two days as a 'pick-me-up' after working long hours. Andrew Hodgson, prosecuting, said: 'What about if you hired it for picking things up, going round crematoria and cemeteries and picking things up and putting them in the back?' The court was told the two stolen wreaths had cost £90 each. Mr Hodgson said: 'These ladies were making money out of what they were doing, by selling on these arrangements. 'A reasonable sum of money can be made in this business, particularly if you are stealing the items that you are selling on.' Defence lawyer Leanne Kennedy said the sisters claimed many of the items used for making wreaths had been left to them by their aunt, who the court was told had been keen on art. Magistrate Dennis Brant said the prosecution case was 'overwhelming'. He said all sentencing options, including jail, were open. They were granted unconditional bail, and the case was adjourned until October 30.

Researchers found that gum disease among hominids, whose remains were found in a region of southern Georgia, was caused by what is thought to have been a basic form of toothpick. They say that their findings shed some light on why the mandibles, or jaws, of the primitive humans were so varied in shape. Revelation: Early humans were using toothpicks almost 1.8million years ago, scientists have discovered . Basic: Researchers found that gum disease among hominids, whose remains were found in a region of southern Georgia, was caused by what is thought to have been a basic form of toothpick . Although they had previously used the hominid teeth to discern what individuals ate and their age, this is the first time that they have been able to offer an explanation for the differences in hominid teeth. They studied the remains because they believed that the wear and malformations couldn't be caused by genetics. Some scientists had previously believed that the differences were caused by variations between sexes while others thought they might have been indicative of different species. Ani Margvelashvili, from the University of Zurich, told the BBC: 'Progressive tooth wear triggers bone remodelling processes that substantially modify the shape of the jaw during an individual's lifetime.' Variations: Researchers say that their findings shed some light on why the mandibles, or jaws, of the primitive humans were so varied in shape . Research: Some scientists had previously believed that the differences were caused by variations between sexes while others thought they might have been indicative of different species . Ms Margvelashvili added that the group had found a small lesion between the teeth and the gums of one of the jaws examined. 'The . individual who was using a toothpick was young, as his or her teeth . were not worn down. There was a small cylinder-shaped lesion - in this . area, if you place a toothpick it goes through.' One of the jaws examined had lost all of his or her teeth except for one canine. It is thought he or she was able to survive by using tools to mash up food. The study was carried out on well preserved remains found at Dmanisi between 1991 and 2005. The bones belong to the earliest proto-humans known to exist outside of Africa. Dmanisi hominids had slightly smaller brains that us, walked upright and used tools. They were initially thought to be a separate species of Homo but are now referred to as Homo erectus georgicus. The remains were discovered by David Lordkipanidze in 1991.","But the crude early dentistry actually made their teeth fall out and is believed to be the first example of over-zealous brushing .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 08:37 EST, 9 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:34 EST, 9 October 2013 . Three people convicted of murder in fatal crashes urged New York's highest court to throw out their convictions on Tuesday, arguing they were too intoxicated to know the threat they posed to others. The murder convictions of Martin Heidgen, Taliyah Taylor and Franklin McPherson all hinge on the prosecution's contention they acted with 'depraved indifference to human life' in the deadly incidents. All three crashes share a number of common threads: driving too fast in the wrong lane while under the influence. Jailed: Martin Heidgen in court in 2006 reacts after the jury found him guilty of two counts of murder in a DUI crash. Lawyers for Heidgen and two other drivers are trying to overturn the convictions, claiming their clients were 'too intoxicated' to know what they were doing . Defense attorneys argued prosecutors failed to prove their clients acted with depraved indifference and, in fact, their clients were too impaired to know what they were doing. Heidgen's attorney, Jillian Harrington, said her client had gotten lost when he drove his pickup the wrong way on Long Island's Meadowbrook State Parkway in 2005. He hit a limousine, killing the driver, Stanley Rabinowitz, and 7-year-old passenger Katie Flynn and injuring five others. 'We have no proof he realized he was going in the wrong direction,' Harrington told the Court of Appeals. Fatal: Taliyah Taylor was naked when she sped 80 mph down Staten Island's Forest Avenue in 2006 without headlights, ran a red light and killed pedestrian Larry Simon . Heidgen had a blood alcohol content of 0.28 percent, police said. Now 32, he's serving 19 years to life in prison. 'This is a question of fact for the jury,' Nassau County Assistant District Attorney Maureen McCormick countered. McCormick urged the court to uphold the juries' conclusions in the cases of Heidgen and McPherson, who was involved in a 2007 crash on Long Island's Southern State Parkway. McPherson hit another vehicle, killing driver Leslie Burgess. His BAC was 0.19 percent. Now 26, he's serving 25 years to life in prison. 'I'm saying they wanted to go where they wanted to go, and other people be damned,' McCormick said. Since there's always substantial traffic in Nassau County, there's 'no possibility' the drivers didn't know the threat, she said. Evidence: A Lincoln stretch limousine, left, and a Chevy Silverado pickup truck are put on display outside the Nassau County Courthouse where Martin Heidgen was convicted for murder in the drunken driving accident that killed two people . McPherson's attorney, Jonathan Edelstein, said evidence showed his client didn't attempt to brake before the crash, so unless prosecutors were to argue he was suicidal - which they didn't - 'that would have to mean he was oblivious.' 'Nobody who's not oblivious will plow head-on into another vehicle at 60 miles per hour,' Edelstein said. Taylor was naked when she sped 80 mph down Staten Island's Forest Avenue in 2006 without headlights, ran a red light and killed pedestrian Larry Simon. She had taken Ecstasy, smoked marijuana and drank beer. Defense attorney Erica Horwitz said her client made a number of irrational statements after the crash. 'She was driving naked because God wanted her to drive naked,' Horwitz said. Staten Island Assistant District Attorney Anne Grady argued that Taylor had made conscious choices despite her impairment, and showed no remorse later when the intoxication wore off. Cuffed: All three crashes share a number of common threads: driving too fast in the wrong lane while under the influence. The drivers were arrested and convicted for murder on DUI charges (as seen in this file photo) Now 31, Taylor was sentenced to 22 years to life. All three drivers were also convicted of lesser charges ranging from reckless endangerment to vehicular manslaughter that were not contested in the appeals. A mid-level court upheld all three murder convictions. The Court of Appeals rulings are expected next month.","Martin Heidgen, Taliyah Taylor and Franklin McPherson all killed people while driving too fast in the wrong lane and under the influence .

A man who has suffered tens of thousands of silent crying seizures since he was a baby has been cured by pioneering surgery. Chris Murto, 29, endured years of pain and medications due to a rare benign tumor before the procedure at Barrow Neurological Institute at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix. But since undergoing surgery, which involved a laser killing the tumor and required just one stitch afterwards, he has miraculously not suffered a single seizure. 'This surgery has changed my life,' Murto told ABC News. 'It's amazing to have instantly gone from having 250 seizures a . month to not having one. I'm finally able to live . an independent life.' Scroll down for video . New life: Chris Murto, 29, (with his parents Bill and Maura) underwent an operation 2 months ago that cured seizures he has been suffering with since birth. Before the operation, he was having thousands a year . Long suffering: Murto, pictured as a boy, suffered a drop in his IQ thanks to medications and the seizures. By the time he was 13, he was having 350 seizures a day and taking 25 pills . The seizures started when he was a baby and appeared to be night terrors - jolting him awake and causing him to cry. When he was five, his mother noticed him grimace before a tear rolled down his cheek, and took him to the doctors where he was diagnosed him with a hypothalamic hamartoma, an abnormal collection of cells near his hypothalamus, which is located at the base of the brain. 'The . cells are like a little pacemaker that fires abnormal signals' his neurosurgeon, Dr Peter Nakaji, explained. 'They are basically like a computer . that keeps resetting. You can imagine how disruptive that is . and what their life is like.' As well as causing discomfort and sparking children to laugh or cry against their wills, the seizures can also damage the brain. Doctors could do nothing but tell Chris to change his diet and give him medications - but drugs drastically affected his cognitive abilities, causing his IQ to plummet from 120 to 79, he told Fox10. Pioneering: His neurosurgeon, Dr Peter Nakaji, used a laser to burn and kill a tumor at the base of his brain . Life changer: Dr Nakaji (with Murto) said the abnormal cells caused the brain to reset every few minutes . By the time he was 13, he was having as many as 250 seizures a month and taking 25 pills a day. Each seizure lasted around 20 seconds. 'He had tremors in his hand, his eyes rolled up in his head so you could see the whites, he slept a lot and his drool was out of control,' his mother Maura told ABC News. 'He was losing ground mentally and physically.' Chris added: 'It's impossible to explain the amount of pain I was experiencing.' He said that the seizures left him feeling displaced and with a pulsing in his ears. At one point when he was 13, he asked his mother: 'Why won't God just let me die?' But in August, Dr. Nakaji was finally able to help and treated Murto with a new kind of surgery that uses MRI technology to find and destroy the tumor. Charting his progress: A chart shows that he had five seizures the morning before surgery - but none since . Relief: His mother Maura said she was 'oh so happy' that her son had not suffered a single seizure since . Dr Nakaji cut a two-millimeter incision in Murto's skull and inserted the laser catheter and lined it up perfectly - careful not to affect any surrounding brain matter. The laser heated up the tumor and killed it, and the cells were then absorbed into the body. Afterwards, Murto needed just one stitch and stayed in hospital for a night. Two months on, and Murto has not had a single seizure and can now finally focus on a future. 'It was amazing,' his mother told Fox. 'It went as text book perfect as it could. He had five seizures before the surgery that morning. Has had none since so I was just oh so happy.' Murto said he now wants to find a job programming computer games.

The millionaire adult entertainment boss has boasted of having more than a dozen girls at his beck and call, offering them a luxury lifestyle and lavish gifts in return for satisfying his sexual needs.

Former . glamour model Natasha Anastasia Eustace claimed that far from being one . of many dalliances for the porn tycoon – who sometimes stars in his . adult films – they had a ‘loving relationship’ and had discussed . marriage. MR Baxendale-Walker has starred in porn films made by his own company, the court heard . Yesterday . Oxford-educated Mr Baxendale-Walker lost the first round of a  High . Court battle with his ex-lover as a judge dismissed his attempts to . throw out the case. Mr . Justice Males ruled that 25-year-old Miss Eustace may have been more . than ‘just another stripper who would have sex with him in exchange for . temporary material benefits’ and ordered a full trial to decide the . issue. He said that after graduating Mr  Baxendale-Walker, 49, worked as a barrister and later as a solicitor specialising in tax law. ‘Some . people might have found that exciting enough but … he [later] acquired . and ran a  company making pornographic films in which he also starred,’ the judge said. ‘He describes himself now  as a wealthy man living a  playboy lifestyle. ‘His . lifestyle involves essentially casual relationships with multiple . sexual partners, a group or club of women known as his “hunny bunnies” to whom, in return for their sexual favours, he makes lavish gifts, . including money, clothes and holidays, as well as providing flats and . cars for their use.’ According . to Mr Baxendale-Walker, Miss Eustace was a member of this club and . their relationship was casual and ‘non-exclusive’ on both sides before . it ended in October 2012. Mr . Baxendale-Walker, who bought lads’ magazine Loaded in May 2012, had . told the court that Miss Eustace ‘was never anything more than a TV . stripper and glamour model, who provided sex and occasional . companionship in exchange for a comfortable and conditional standard of . living’. The flat at the centre of the dispute is located in picturesque Walton-on-Thames in Surrey. File picture . ‘She is only one of more than a dozen girls for whom I procure the provision [of] housing, cars and other benefits,’ he said. ‘The provision is always conditional on my satisfaction with the relationship. ‘As soon as I am no longer satisfied, the benefits are withdrawn’. But Miss Eustace claimed the pair had a ‘loving and close relationship’ which lasted until the beginning of this year. A file picture of a Range Rover.

Startling differences in how long people can expect to lead healthy lives in the North of England compared to the South have been exposed for the first time. Residents of the wealthiest southern parts of the country can expect to stay well and active for as much as 18 years longer than the nation’s poorest, yesterday’s official figures show. But in the North and deprived parts of London, illness and disability start much earlier. At worst, in the North East, people can expect health problems to restrict their lives five years before pension age. Divide: People in Richmond are the healthiest while people in Manchester and other areas of the north struggle with their health more . The Office for National Statistics figures are the first published estimates for healthy life expectancy – the age people are likely to reach before ill health seriously affects their quality of life. They show that an affluent borough in south-west London is the fittest part of the country. In green, suburban Richmond upon Thames, newborn girls and boys are likely to live beyond 70 without suffering life-limiting illnesses. Healthy life expectancy for babies born there now is 70.3 years for men, and 72.1 years for women. At the other end of the healthy living spectrum are Manchester, for men, and Tower Hamlets, for women. The London borough of Richmond upon Thames has the highest healthy life expectancy (HLE) in England, according to the Office of National Statistics. Whereas life expectancy is an estimate of how many years a person might be expected to live, healthy life expectancy is an estimate of how many years they might live in a 'healthy' state . Men and women in Richmond upon Thames (above) have an HLE of 70.3 years and 72.1 years respectively . The lowest HLE was in Manchester (above) for men at 55 years and Tower Hamlets for women at 54.1 years - a 15-year gap compared to Richmond upon Thames . In Manchester men will typically find their health failing after 55, while in Tower Hamlets, a short distance across London from Richmond, the estimates say ill health for women begins at 54.1 years of age. The . findings are based on the Annual Population Survey, a state survey that . questions more than 250,000 people, in the years 2009 to 2011. The . questionnaire asked whether people’s general health was very good, . good, fair, bad or very bad, and whether they had any long-standing . disabilities that limited day-to-day activities. The ONS cautioned that the estimates do not give a definitive picture of the health people can expect as they age, partly because mortality and health continue to change, and partly because of the impact of migration. However the findings undoubtedly reveal large regional differences. The . report said: ‘The pattern across regions shows a prominent North-South . divide: healthy life expectancy in the South East, South West and the . East of England was significantly higher than the England average. ‘The West Midlands, North West, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber were significantly lower.’ The . report added that healthy life expectancy for men and women in the East . Midlands, West Midlands, London, Yorkshire and the Humber, North East . and North West was well below 65, which is the state pension age for men . now and for women from 2018. It added: ‘Those living in the southern . regions enjoy not only longer life expectancies but also greater . proportions of their longer lives in a favourable health state compared . with their counterparts living in the north.’ The ONS said the area with the highest gender inequality in life expectancy was Blackpool (above), where women could expect to live an extra 6.2 years . Dr . John Middleton, of the Faculty of Public Health, a professional body, . said: ‘These figures are an important part of a bigger picture of data . that tells us why some people live longer than others. ‘We . know healthy life expectancy is determined by our chances  of being in a . job, living in decent housing and having an adequate income. ‘Clearly having a healthy lifestyle makes a big difference, but so does being in employment. ‘There . are also variations within towns and cities. Parts of Manchester will . have better results than others, and there may well be places near . Richmond where people do not fare as well as these figures suggest.’ In . every area, both life expectancy and healthy life expectancy were . longer for women than for men. The smallest gap was in Rutland, where . women are expected to live just 1.9 years longer than men. The borough of Richmond Upon Thames contains a number of affluent 'villages' including Kew, Barnes and Hampton - and more than a third of it is open green space. Unemployment in the borough currently stands at 4 per cent, one of the lowest in Britain. According to the latest census figures, Richmond upon Thames is one of the least ethnically diverse boroughs in London, with a . non-white population of 14 per cent. It is also ranked as having the highest quality natural environment in London. By . contrast, the ONS said, the biggest difference between men and women . was Blackpool, where women could expect to live an extra 6.2 years. Michelle . Mitchell, director general of charity Age UK, spoke out against plans . to raise the state pension age, warning that in future most people will . not be able to enjoy any of their retirement while still healthy. State pension ages for both men and women will begin to go up to 66 after 2020 – and will rise to 68 in the 2040s. Miss . Mitchell said: ‘These figures reveal the huge variations in the health . of older people across England. It is further evidence that wealthier . parts of the country have significantly more older people in good health . than poorer areas. ‘These . glaring health inequalities must be tackled urgently, particularly as . the Government is contemplating further increases to the state pension . age. ‘Otherwise the . situation could easily arise where the average person in many areas will . not enjoy any retirement in good health.’ A . Department of Health spokesman said: ‘These figures highlight that we . must continue to work to narrow the gap in health inequalities because . everyone should have the same opportunity to lead a healthy life, no . matter where they live or who they are. ‘Local councils have received ring-fenced budgets to help local people get healthier and to reduce health inequalities.’","Men and women in Richmond upon Thames .

With the wind whipping their ears and their jowls flapping in the breeze, a car ride is normally loved by dogs who enjoy sticking their head out of the window. But for one nervous pooch, taking a drive is a frightening thing - and the only way he feels safe is clutching his owner's hand with his paw. A video uploaded to YouTube shows adorable Tommy sitting in the passenger seat while his owner drives. Scroll down for video . Reassured: Tommy doesn't like the sensation of driving, so always insists on holding hands . Car sick! Unlike the rest of his little dog friends, Tommy doesn't much care for car rides . I don't like it! Since the video of the nervous pooch has been posted, thousands have watched it . The driver can be heard chuckling while telling his dog to stop pawing at him, but the animal seems a little anxious as they roll along. Tommy starts nudging him with his head, tries to wriggle on to his lap, and frantically pats him with his paw, letting him know that he doesn't quite enjoy the ride. He only calms down when his owner, called Adam Douglas, eventually clutches his paw and he visibly relaxes. The video has already been viewed thousands of times, with YouTube commentators telling Adam how adorable the video is. Tommy gets a little nervous - but calms down when his owner holds his paw as they go for a ride . He replied: 'Can't believe so many . people like the video. I only uploaded to video to see what the YouTube . video editor﻿ was like so didn't expect this at all. 'I'll . be sure to stick up a few more of Tommy's antics - maybe outside of the . car though, a lot of you seem to be concerned about my driving, which I . can assure you was perfectly safe ;). Glad you all liked it though.' The . driver assured watchers that he used a stand to hold his phone in place . and was on a quiet road, so there was no danger to other motorists or . pedestrians. There's no way Tommy would stick his head out of the window - but at least he feels safer when he's holding Adam his owner . Perhaps he needs some driving lessons, like some of the rescued dogs who are being taught the skills behind the wheel in New Zealand. In December last year, a charity introduced a canine driving school, aimed at proving how intelligent the animals can be. It showed them responding to commands, steering the wheel, change gears and hit the brake, the BBC reported. There is no scientific explanation as to why most dogs love going for car rides. Some believe that they enjoy the higher view point, and like to see the world from a different angle, instead of having to constantly look up. Another popular explanation is that by sticking their head out of the window, they can smell lots of different scents with their powerful noses.","Tommy the dog frantically paws at his owner when he's taken for a drive .

A great-grandmother with dementia was taken to a stranger's house, tucked up in his bed and left for seven hours by bungling hospital staff. Lilian Taylor, 88, was driven by mistake to her previous home in just her nightdress after being discharged from Homerton Hospital in Hackney, east London. The door was answered by a shocked old man who had recently moved in. Mrs Taylor, of nearby Clapton, was then taken upstairs and put into his bed before she was left. Outraged: Fred Taylor (left) said his mother Lilian (right) was driven to the wrong home after being discharged from hospital. Lilian, 88, suffers from dementia and was only found after a panic-stricken Fred raised the alarm . The widow, who has Alzheimer's, was only found and rescued after her panic-stricken son, Fred Taylor, rang the hospital to find out where she had got to. Hospital staff alerted police and officers dashed round to pick up Mrs Taylor at the house in Hackney almost seven hours after she had been released. The police took her back to her sheltered care home, where she's lived since May. Mr Taylor, 65, of Basildon, Essex, said: 'I still can't believe this happened to my poor old mother. It was a bizarre and terrifying episode - an absolute nightmare.' The father-of-two and grandfather-of-two added: 'I'm just so relieved that my mother came out of her terrible ordeal unscathed.' Panic-stricken: Mr Taylor says his mother was discharged from hospital in a flimsy nightdress. He said he was 'worried sick' when he couldn't find her . Mr Taylor said his mother was released by the hospital at about 12.30pm on September 25 - but hours later she still hadn't turned up at her home. 'I was worried sick and my mind was racing wondering where she'd got to. 'So I asked her ex-neighbour to check out her old home,' said Mr Taylor, a retired photographer and tailor. 'She went round and found her lying in this absent-minded elderly man's bed wearing just the light nightdress she'd been released in. 'I immediately called the hospital to tell them what had happened and they brought in the police.' Mr Taylor said it was outrageous that his mum, who used to work for HM Customs & Excise in Holborn, north London, had been treated so badly. 'My mum's a typical born-and-bred East End girl - the salt of the earth. 'She grew up through the Blitz surviving German bombs in the Second World War, has worked incredibly hard all her life and been a first-class citizen,' he said. 'My dad Fred fought with the famous Desert Rats in North Africa. 'He died when he was 91 and I don't know what he'd make of this nonsense. If I had been on holiday, my mother, who has Alzheimer's, may well not be here today. 'She could have been anywhere on the planet and would not have been aware.

For millions of students the early . weeks of university are a raucous mix of letting their hair down, . getting to know the local nightlife and making new friends. But . for freshers at Cambridge University in the 17th century, even playing . football was seen as unruly and 'boisterous' behaviour. A . rulebook for Cambridge students dating back to 1660 offers a . fascinating insight into what university life was like more than 350 years ago. Strict: The Cambridge University Duport Rules which was handed out to Trinity College students in 1660 which reveals long lie-ins were frowned upon, gossiping was banned and picking your nose forbidden . Dress code: Various scholars in academic dress in an excerpt from the book . Unlike . life on campus today, long lie-ins were frowned upon, gossiping with . roommates was banned and picking your nose was forbidden. Football was outlawed because it was 'a rude, boisterous exercise, and fitter for Clownes then for Schollers.' And . newcomers to the university were also advised to only 'use' tennis . sparingly and never 'immediately after meales' because it was 'too . violent and too stirring'. Code of conduct: Freshers at Trinity College Cambridge (pictured) in the 17th century were told that even playing . football was seen as unruly and 'boisterous' behaviour and tennis should be played 'sparingly' The rulebook was compiled by tutor James Duport and given to new students at Trinity College. It . reads: 'When you reade or speake in your Tutors Chamber, or else where . take heed of picking your Nose, or putting your Hatt or Hand to your . face, or any such odd, uncouth, or unseemly gesture.' Freshers were advised to make friends only with 'honest, studious, religious youths'. Warning against bad language, they were also told to 'avoid all profane scurrilous, unsavoury, rotten, frothy communication'. Fresher: A painting from circa 1660-166, shows a Cambridge University scholar of the period in which the rulebook was in use . The rulebook went to warn that gossiping with friends is a waste of time. It . reads: 'Goe not a gadding and gossiping from Chamber to Chamber, for . that is no recreation, but meere idlenesse and losse of time'. Instead the freshers were told: 'Let your discourse be sauoury & sappy.' Duport's rules also guided students on their appearance. He wrote: 'Wear no boots, nor powder your hair, let yr Garb be grave & sober, yet cheerful & pleasant.' And unlike modern students, 17th century scholars were not allowed to lie around in bed, particularly on Sundays. They were told: 'Rise earlier on the Lords day, then ordinary, and be more carefull to trimme your soules then bodyes.' They had to attend mandatory chapel services and the rule book warned against being late. It . read: 'Use to be at Chappell at the beginning & come not drooping . in (after the uncouth & ungodly manner of some) when almost all is . done.' The students of 350 years ago were younger than today's and were taught a curriculum centred on Latin, Greek and Theology. They were expected to read in the original language of sources and to 'speake Latine alwayes in the Hall'. As . it was a time of political and economic unrest with the English Civil . war students were advised to 'Beware of riot, excess & . intemperance'.

A young girl who was thought to be paralysed after being shot by a gang two and a half years ago now has feeling in both legs, it was claimed today. Thusha Kamaleswaran was caught in crossfire when thugs attacked her uncle's shop in South London while she was playing in the aisle. Doctors feared that she would never be able to move her legs again - but now a documentary reports that she has regained feeling, raising the likelihood that she might one day be able to walk. Recovery: Thusha Kamaleswaran has regained the feeling in her legs after being shot by gang members . The remarkable recovery of the eight-year-old is documented in ITV's Tonight, which followed her around as she was treated in hospital. In a heart-warming trailer for the programme, she is seen smiling as she is praised for the extraordinary progress she has made in her rehabilitation. As a medic manipulates her foot, Thusha can now tell whether her toes are pointing upwards or downwards without looking. The ITV programme also shows her reunited for the first time with the emergency workers who saved her life. Carefree: The schoolgirl, then five, was pictured dancing in the aisles just before she was shot in March 2011 . Thusha was hit in the chest and the bullet passed through the seventh vertebra of her spine. Chilling CCTV footage showed the girl, . then five, skipping and dancing in one of the aisles of the shop when she was shot in March 2011. She lay slumped on the floor before relatives grabbed her and rushed her to safety at the back of the shop. Thusha went into cardiac arrest twice, and had to undergo emergency surgery in the shop and in hospital. She . was unconscious for a week and had to be kept on a life-support . machine, while her parents were warned she had only a 50 per cent chance . of survival. Jailed: Anthony McCalla and Kazeem Kolawole were two of the thugs convicted over the shooting . Gunman: Nathaniel Grant fired the shots which hit Thusha while targeting a rival gang . Nathaniel Grant, Anthony McCalla and . Kazeem Kolawole were given life sentences at the Old Bailey in April . last year for causing Thusha and shopper Roshan Selvakumar grievous . bodily harm with intent. They . were members of the Brixton-based OC (Organised Criminals) gang, and . were targeting a member of their bitter rivals ABM (All Bout Money) when . Grant opened fire into the shop in Stockwell. After the three men were sentenced, Thusha's mother Sharmila expressed disappointment that they might one day be released. The family fled their native Sri Lanka because of the violence stemming from the country's long-running civil war - only for their daughter to be caught up in a gang battle in their adopted home. Earlier this year, Thusha said: ‘I can’t wait until I can walk properly on my own again. ‘I’ve already taken some steps on the treadmill in my harness with my physio helping me. I want to dance around and play basketball with my friends.’ Despite her injuries, she has remained surprisingly independent and insists on helping her parents with the cooking and other household chores.

Tough: Home Secretary Theresa May will push ahead with plans to 'deport first and hear an appeal later' Banks will be forced to carry out background checks to stop illegal immigrants opening accounts. The proposal – one of several in the long-awaited Immigration Bill – would force managers to check potential customers against a database of foreigners known to be in the country illegally. Applicants for a driving licence would also have to prove they were in Britain legally. Those who are unable to do so would be turned down. Ministers said the law would stop . illegal immigrants using public services and discourage them from coming . to Britain in the first place. The . stricter rules follow elements of the Bill already announced, such as . requiring private landlords to check the immigration status of tenants. Temporary . migrants, such as foreign students, would also have to make a . contribution to the NHS before they could use GP and hospital services, . following concerns about the cost of  health tourism to the taxpayer. However, ministers are thought to have dropped a proposal to make GPs check the immigration status of new patients. Home . Secretary Theresa May will push ahead with plans to ‘deport first and . hear an appeal later’ in cases involving foreign criminals, terrorists . and illegal immigrants. Mrs .

'Surely the Government should do something about it, and that is exactly what we’re doing.' She went on: 'Crucially, . in the Bill what we’ll be doing is addressing the issue that people get . fed up when they feel that people are able to come into the country and . access the health service without having contributed to it. 'So we will be asking for a surcharge . - there’ll be a sort of levy on people who are going to be coming here . to be staying for a while to contribute so that people can feel it’s . fair that actually people are being asked to contribute to public . services such as the NHS.' The proposal would force bank managers to check potential customers against a database of foreigners known to be in the country illegally . The shake-up of immigration law will let the Government remove dangerous migrants from the country while their cases proceed instead of having to let them remain in Britain for years during their appeal. In addition, the list of grounds for appeal will be slashed from 17 to just four. This is a response to the debacle of the deportation of Abu Qatada, who was flown home to Jordan in July after a 12-year legal battle. It is expected to cut the 68,000 cases lodged against the Government every year by more than half. The Bill will also: .

David Hanson, Labour's shadow immigration minister, said: 'Theresa May has a history of promising big and pretending all is well, but the Government is continuing to fail on immigration policy.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor and James Slack . PUBLISHED: . 07:02 EST, 25 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:06 EST, 25 April 2013 . Nick Clegg yesterday killed the controversial ‘snoopers’ charter’ live on local radio. The Deputy Prime Minister triggered a bitter new Coalition split as he ripped up £400million of Home Office work by saying the plan to allow police and the security services to monitor the public’s emails and internet visits was ‘not going to happen’. Officials believed they had a commitment from Mr Clegg that the Liberal Democrats would support the legislation being included in the upcoming Queen’s Speech. Nick Clegg, on a visit to Stockwell Park Estate in London with police today, said he would not back reworked Home Office plans to track data . The Deputy Prime Minister said he had spoken to senior police officers and the security services about why he was opposed to a vast database tracking all online activity . Last month, the Home Office’s top . counter-terrorism official, Charles Farr, said there was . ‘cross-governmental approval’ for the plan. Mr Clegg’s remarks were welcomed by civil liberties groups, which have fought a dogged campaign against the ‘Big Brother’ proposal. But the dropping of the plans will alarm the security services, police and child protection experts. Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, has said changing the law was a ‘matter of life and death’. Supporters claim that, without the new laws, paedophiles, organised criminals and terrorists will escape detection. There was astonishment in Whitehall that Mr Clegg had chosen the platform of his weekly phone-in on London’s LBC radio station to make such a major announcement. The Lib Dem leader's comments were welcomed by civil liberties campaigners, but Downing Street insisted discussions were ongoing . Mr Clegg was joined on the visit to Brixton by Lib Dem Home Office minister Jeremy Browne (centre) Mr Clegg, who met local residents on the Stockwell Park Estate, said he wanted to protect people from unnecessary intrusion . The Communications Data Bill was a central plank of the Government’s counter-terrorism strategy, and Home Secretary Theresa May had been determined to see it become law. In recent weeks, the Home Office had offered a string of concessions to Mr Clegg, who was under strong pressure from his own MPs to veto the legislation. Mrs May accepted every recommendation made by a joint committee of Lords and MPs, set up at Mr Clegg’s request, to water down the original plan, and Home Office ministers and officials were convinced they had Mr Clegg’s backing. But on Wednesday – only a few hours before Mr Clegg went on the radio – the Prime Minister was told he was pulling the plug on the negotiations. Officials say it is the second time Mr Clegg has changed his position on supporting the Bill. It came amid Coalition tensions over whether to withdraw temporarily from the European Court of Human Rights to improve the chances of booting out Abu Qatada. Yesterday, Lib Dem MPs and peers were delighted at the death of plans, which would have led to the storage of details of the public’s email, website visits and use of Skype and social media. Police and security officials would have been able to ask internet companies to provide details of who a person was contacting – but not the content. Home Secretary Theresa May had hoped to reach a compromise deal so that legislation could be included in the Queen's Speech on May 8 . Tim Farron, the president of the Lib Dems, tweeted: ‘We have killed the Snooper Charter – campaigning together we have stopped this. Standing up for civil liberties and freedom of speech.’ Tory backbenchers were also happy. Dominic Raab said: ‘This Orwellian scheme should be buried for good. For the billions it would cost, there are far better ways to strengthen law enforcement without snooping on every law-abiding citizen.’ Mr Clegg broke the news shortly after 9am on his weekly phone-in. He said: ‘The idea was that the Government would pass a law which means there would be a record kept of every website you visit, who you communicate with on social media sites. ‘That is not going to happen. It is certainly not going to happen with Liberal Democrats in Government.’ Mr Clegg said he did not believe the British public would support the hoarding of huge amount of information about individuals’ internet use in a ‘treasure trove of data which you can then dip into if you need to’. Further work is expected on how new legislation might be introduced to deal with the limited problem faced by the police in matching internet addresses with individual mobile phones or computers. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman would not be drawn on whether legislation in this area would feature in the Queen’s Speech. Sources close to Mr Clegg said it was ‘rubbish’ to suggest he had supported the Bill. They said the announcement had been made on LBC because he was asked a question on the subject. Few tears will be shed for the ‘snoopers’ charter’ outside of Whitehall. From the moment the idea was suggested by Labour, it has been condemned as an Orwellian assault on civil liberties. Ministers tried desperately to refine the proposals to make them acceptable to a deeply sceptical public. For example, Theresa May ditched Labour’s idea of storing communications data on a giant  central government database – saying it would be left to individual internet service providers to keep the information. But despite all the forceful efforts by senior police and the Government to sell the idea, the case was never successfully made for having the power to spy on the public’s every internet click and Facebook visit. However, while millions will welcome the death of the legislation, there is good reason to be alarmed about how the decision was reached. Last month, the Home Office believed it had a cast-iron guarantee from Nick Clegg that the Bill would be included in the forthcoming Queen’s Speech. Charles Farr, the Home Office’s most senior counter-terrorism official, stated publicly that the proposal had ‘cross-governmental approval’. Yet, on Wednesday, Mr Clegg – whose aides insist he never backed the legislation – announced to the Prime Minister that he was blocking the Bill. He then used the platform of his weekly radio show on LBC, of all places, to announce what amounts to a fundamental shift in government policy on national security. Never mind the fact that local radio is no place to reveal that talks have broken down over how to keep the country safe. What is most worrying is that the Government is so dysfunctional that its two halves cannot even agree on whether Mr Clegg ever supported the idea in the first place. Yesterday may have been a good day for civil liberties. But it was another shambles for the pantomime-horse Coalition.","Deputy Prime Minister says reworked package is not acceptable .

Construction workers who were put on a secret industry blacklist after they raised legitimate health and safety concerns will be compensated by companies who worked with the list's . More than 3,200 names, mainly of building workers, were kept on the list, drawn up by a shadowy organisation called the Consulting Association. Workers involved claimed they were denied work, often for merely raising legitimate concerns about health and safety on building sites. Legal action is being taken on behalf of some of those on the list. Compensation: Building workers who appeared on the 'blacklist' claimed they were denied work, often for merely raising legitimate concerns (posed from library) The eight firms announced that they are working together to develop a scheme to compensate construction workers whose names were on The Consulting Association (TCA) database. A statement said: 'The companies - Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Kier, Laing O’Rourke, Sir Robert McAlpine, Skanska UK and VINCI PLC - all apologise for their involvement with TCA and the impact that its database may have had on any individual construction worker. 'The companies have joined together to establish the Construction Workers Compensation Scheme. 'The scheme is intended to make it as simple as possible for any worker with a legitimate claim to access compensation. 'The companies have invited workers’ representatives to enter into a period of engagement to ensure that the . proposed terms of the scheme are fair and effective. The group is also . engaging with other interested parties. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said Labour wants the companies guilty of blacklisting to come forward . 'At this time we are not able to share any further information on the proposed scheme. However, once engagement with the workers’ representatives has concluded, we will announce full details of the scheme which we would like to open to applicants as soon as possible. 'We have discussed the scheme with a number of other construction companies. 'We encourage participation from across the industry and would welcome interest from any company that had been a user of, or subscriber to, TCA. 'The companies involved in the scheme would support the introduction of a code of conduct to ensure nothing like this can happen within the construction industry again.' The Consulting Association was closed . down following a raid on its West Midlands offices by the Information . Commissioner’s Office. But unions said workers continued to be discriminated against if their names were on the list. A total of 44 firms were found to be using the blacklist. The names of a number of environmental activists were also on the blacklist. The TUC is organising a national day of action on November 20 over the blacklisting. The development follows years of campaigning by unions who welcomed the news; although some campaigners said more should be done. Justin Bowden of the GMB union said: 'Firms admitting they engaged in a terrible abuse of the civil rights of thousands of UK workers is an important step. 'The next step is clean up and pay up. This remains our demand on the construction industry.' Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: 'These employers appear to be responding to union demands to ‘own up, clean up and pay up’. 'However, any proposals cannot exclude the involvement of blacklisted workers and their trade unions. 'It is now time for the unions and the employers to thrash out the details and build on these proposals, which look encouraging. 'It must be a priority to get blacklisted workers back into work. Unite is calling on contractors to employ, and where relevant support the up-skilling of blacklisted workers. 'Firms admitting they engaged in a terrible abuse of the civil rights of thousands of UK workers is an important step. The next step is clean up and pay up' -Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail . 'Many of these workers have spent years out of work as a result of being blacklisted. Employers have a moral duty to give them back the jobs that were wrongly taken away from them.' Unions have demanded a thorough Leveson-style inquiry into the scandal. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: 'Labour has led calls for those companies guilty of blacklisting to come forward, apologise and provide compensation to victims of the scandal. This announcement is a welcome step, though it should have been made a long time ago. 'Given that 44 companies have been named as having used the construction industry blacklist, it is regrettable this announcement only covers eight firms. 'We will be closely monitoring and scrutinising the compensation scheme as it progresses to ensure it provides proper redress to victims swiftly and commands confidence. 'It also underlines the need for a full inquiry into the blacklisting scandal to make sure it is never repeated. If ministers refuse to take this crucial step, a future Labour government will.' Steve Murphy, general secretary of the building workers’ union Ucatt, said: 'This is a step forward. The companies involved are admitting their guilt for the first time and are recognising that the victims of blacklisting deserve compensation. 'However, to be a legitimate scheme, all 3,213 blacklisted victims or their dependents must be notified that they were on a blacklist.'","More than 3,200 names, mainly of building workers, were kept on the list, drawn up by a shadowy organisation called The Consulting Association .

A centuries-old mummified head, pictured, once thought to have belonged to a 17th century king has been found to have no royal lineage at all . After three years of tests, a centuries-old mummified head once thought to have belonged to a 17th century king has been found to have no royal lineage at all. Belgian geneticist Jean-Jacques . Cassiman compared DNA from the embalmed head with three living relatives of the king and found a genetic mismatch, suggesting it can't be him. This discovery refutes claims made in 2010 by French researchers who used facial reconstruction to determine that the head was that of King Henry IV. Henry IV was credited with bringing religious peace to France and was responsible for building Parisian landmarks such as the Pont Neuf bridge. He reigned from 1589 to May 1610, when he was assassinated by a Catholic fanatic. Henry IV was the first of the Bourbon monarchs and grandfather of King Louis XIV. Cassiman, from the University of Leuven, wrote in the European Journal of Human Genetic that it is 'impossible' for the head to belong to the French king, but admitted he was not able to determine who it belonged to. The same study also found a blood sample . previously attributed to King Louis XVI, one of Henry's descendants, . lacked any royal ties as well. Louis XVI died during the . French Revolution and many spectators reportedly soaked their . handkerchiefs in the king's blood. However, Cassiman and colleagues found the . lingering traces of powdered blood on the handkerchief they tested did . not match the Bourbon family DNA either. The left-hand image is taken from a painting of . King Henry IV from the 17th Century. The right-hand image shows the . facial reconstruction, carried out by Philippe Charlier in 2010, of the . embalmed head. The similarities were used by the original researchers to . determine that the head belonged to the king .

He reigned from 1589 to May 1610, when he was assassinated by a Catholic fanatic. Henry IV was the first of the Bourbon monarchs and grandfather of the Sun King Louis XIV. During the French revolution, the royal tombs . at Saint Denis near Paris were dug up and some accounts claim Henry IV's . head was chopped off and stolen. Yet Cassiman from the University of Leuven disputes this, claiming Henry is still buried in Saint Denis after the tombs were resealed in 1817. The DNA from both the head and the handkerchief failed to match . samples from other royal families on record. During the revolution, the royal tombs at Saint Denis near Paris were dug up and some accounts claim Henry IV's head was chopped off and stolen. Cassiman and his co-authors dispute that Henry was decapitated and believe the king is still buried in Saint Denis after the tombs were resealed in 1817. 'That is impossible to verify,' said Michael Rowe, a senior lecturer in European history at King's College London, who was not connected to either study. He said there wasn't much evidence one way or the other to suggest what happened to Henry's head, but added the king's reputation as one of France's best kings might have saved his body from decapitation: 'If the revolutionaries were going to spare any of the kings, it would have been Henry IV.' Philippe Charlier, author of the 2010 study that identified the head as Henry IV, dismissed the new research. He said he and his colleagues have found an exact match between a three-dimensional comparison of the ancient head and Henry IV's death mask and said the work will soon be published in a forensic journal. Charlier added there were numerous . doubts about the paternity of various kings in the Bourbon line, which . might explain why there was no link between the DNA of modern-day . descendants and the ancient head. Two years ago, analysis of DNA taken . by Charlier, from traces of blood found inside a gourd where the . handkerchief was kept revealed a likely match for someone of Louis XVI's . description, including his blue eyes. But it was never able to be proved beyond doubt as at the time the team did not have DNA of any royal relation. Left is a statue of the king showing a cut to his nose. The right image is an engraving of the king wearing an earring. These markings on the skull led the scientists to claim it belonged to the king in 2010. However, Cassiman's research claims DNA evidence proves the head doesn't have any royal lineage . Their research uncovered a rare genetic signature shared by two men separated by seven generations, and managed to provide evidence for the authenticity of both sets of remains in the process. French forensic pathologist Philippe Charlier said: 'This study shows that (the owners of the remains) share a genetic heritage passed on through the paternal line.' Frank Ruehli, of the University of Zurich and the Swiss Mummy project, agreed there could be questions about paternity in the Bourbon line and also raised concerns about the authenticity of the ancient DNA samples, as he said it was very difficult to get good data from a sample several centuries old. 'The best would be to look at (Henry IV's) heart as well,' he said. 'If you have multiple tissues from the same body showing the same results, that would be a positive identification.' Ruehli continued that given the lack of complete data, it was impossible to know for sure whom the head belonged to. Charlier said the mummified head is currently in a Parisian bank vault awaiting reburial but that there are no exact plans yet.","King Henry IV of France was killed in 1610 by a Catholic protestor .

Nick Clegg today hit out at the Guardian for publishing secret files which served ‘no purpose’ other than to aid terrorists who want to harm Britain. The Lib Dem leader joined the barrage of criticism that the newspaper released UK’s intelligence secrets of no interest to readers but highly-valued by fanatics and foreign spies. It follows MI5 director-general Andrew Parker’s warning this week that the leaks are a ‘gift’ to terrorists. Scroll down for video . Criticism: In a highly-unusual move, Nick Clegg criticised the Guardian's decision to publish secret files which would only have been of interest to terrorists . The publication of secret files leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden are said to have caused huge ‘harm’ to the capability of Britain’s intelligence services. Security officials fear the data will be used by terrorists to avoid detection when plotting an atrocity. The Guardian has argued its revelations have ‘prompted a debate which was both necessary and overdue’. But Mr Clegg rubbished the idea that highly-sensitive intelligence needed to be released in order to prompt discussions about the scale of the surveillance state. In an unusual attack on the left-wing newspaper, Mr Clegg said: ‘I think it’s a totally legitimate debate about the power of these technologies, about how you get the balance right, how do you make sure these technologies are used in a proportionate and accountable way. ‘But, I don’t think just giving technical secrets, if I can put it that way, to people who want to do us harm serves any purpose.’ Speaking on his weekly phone-in on LBC 97.3, he added: ‘I’ve got no doubt that there were some parts of what was published which will have passed most readers of the Guardian completely by, because they were very technical, but would have been of immense interest to people who want to do us harm. 'I certainly agree that if what you end up doing is just basically publishing very technical information, that actually most Guardian readers, or most of us wouldn’t frankly understand, but the only people who will understand are the sort of technicians if you like amongst the terrorists, then what’s the public interest in that?' Fury: The spy chief: MI5 director-general Andrew Parker has blasted the Guardian's publication of Britain's espionage capabilities . His comments came after Mr Parker warned that the disclosure of the ‘reach and limits’ of the GCHQ's capabilities was a gift  to terrorists. In a speech this week Mr Parker said: ‘It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists. 'It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will. Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret, and why not doing so causes such harm.’ Guardian newspaper editor Alan Rusbridger was described as 'naive' Mr Parker dismissed suggestions that . the agencies were trawling through people's private lives for anything . that looked interesting as ‘utter nonsense’. Yesterday . David Cameron backed Mr Parker. A No 10 spokesman – when asked whether . Mr Cameron agreed with Mr Parker’s comments – said: ‘The Prime Minister . thinks it was an excellent speech and we are, as you would expect, . always keeping under review the measures that are needed to contribute . to keeping our country safe. I would happily point you to all parts of . the director general’s speech.’ Mr Clegg argued that secrecy was vital in order to keep the country safe. ‘We have legislation, and regulations, which were designed for an age which is quite different now, and both terrorists and States and security agencies, now conduct this battle, if you like, online in a way that was unimaginable just even a few years ago. ‘And, what that means for privacy and proportionality, I think that’s a totally legitimate area for debate. ‘How you hold the secret parts of any State to account is an incredibly important issue, because secrecy is necessary, of course it is, you absolutely must defend the principle of secrecy from the intelligence agencies without which they can’t keep us safe. ‘But, you can only really make secrecy legitimate in the eyes of the public if there is proper form of accountability.’ Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger denied putting lives at risk and – defying security officials – said he would continue publishing top secret information, which the paper has been splashing across its front pages since June. In an interview yesterday he said: ‘We are working slowly and responsibly but as we discover further stories that we think merit the debate, the debate that everyone says is necessary, then we will go on publishing.’ The first Guardian revelations came in early June, when it detailed how the NSA – which supplies intelligence to GCHQ, the organisation which gathers intelligence for MI5 and MI6 – had ‘direct access’ to the computer systems of AOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Paltalk, Skype, Yahoo and YouTube. The newspaper also revealed how GCHQ has access to a network of cables carrying international phone calls and internet traffic and is processing vast amounts of ‘personal information’. By the time his identity as the source of the leaks emerged, Snowden had fled his home in Hawaii for Hong Kong. After a week in hiding, he travelled to Moscow, where he remains out of the reach of US authorities.","Lib Dem leader said readers would have been baffled by the leaks .

A teenager accused of planning a repeat of the Columbine massacre 'glorified' the leader of the English Defence League (EDL), a court has heard. The 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is on trial accused of stockpiling weapons for a terror attack on his former school in Loughborough, East Midlands. His sixth-form college, a local mosque, Loughborough University, a cinema and council offices were also named as potential targets, it is alleged. The teenager, whose identity is hidden in this artistic drawing, idolised Hitler and former EDL leader Tommy Robinson, a court has been told . The Old Bailey was told that the boy told police officers he was 'experimenting' when they uncovered a stockpile of weapons in his bedroom. Jurors at the Old Bailey were shown weapons recovered by Leicestershire police officers, including air rifles, knives, a crossbow and a machete, after they searched his bedroom in February. Officers had been called to his home address following reports the teenager had threatened two schoolboys with a knife, the court heard. After police entered his bedroom, he said 'I carry the knife for my own protection', the jury was told. After handing over two knives kept in two different coats, he added: 'I better give you these. I've been experimenting.' Police recovered a number of weapons including a knife with a Swastika and the words 'blood and honour' inscribed, a machete with a £12.95 price tag attached, three throwing knives, a green ammunition box, a number of air rifles, BB guns, a crossbow and a gun holster, the court heard. A manager of a local clothes store said the defendant spoke about Tommy Robinson, who resigned as EDL leader yesterday . A newspaper cutting on the number of U.S. deaths in the war on the Taliban as well as stories on an alleged racist text by British National Party (BNP) leader Nick Griffin and on gun crime in Liverpool were also shown to the jury. The court has previously heard the teenager allegedly wrote in a Che Guevara notebook emblazoned with Swastikas his plans for The New Columbine. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and one teacher at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999 in one of America's worst mass shootings. Edward Roe, the manager of the Irish Clothing Company store in Loughborough where the teenager bought military clothing and accessories, said he knew the boy held far-right wing views. In a witness statement read to the Old Bailey jury, Mr Roe said the alleged terror plotter had spoken about former EDL leader Tommy Robinson, who resigned from the far-right group yesterday, and ordered a t-shirt with am 'German SS' badge. 'We had a conversation with regards to the EDL, which I know stands for the English Defence League,' Mr Roe said. 'I believe they incite hatred against different races and creeds, Asians in particular. 'He talked about Tommy Robinson who I have heard of but I don't know who he is,' he continued. 'I didn't want to talk about this kind of thing. I think he was glorifying Tommy Robinson, whoever he was. 'He also tried to order a Death Skull t-shirt. This is a large German SS badge that would be worn on the collar. 'This is not an item that the shop would stock or be associated with. I told him it wasn't something we would stock.' Angela Martin, another manager at the shop, said the defendant had told her in January that he thought it was OK to carry a knife, before adding: 'If I could I would kill someone.' She told the court the teenager had allegedly previously bought a t-shirt with a Taliban slogan and ordered a stab vest. The 17-year-old boy is on trial at the Old Bailey, accused of stockpiling weapons for a terror attack on his former school in Loughborough, East Midlands . The court also heard from a schoolboy . who claimed the defendant threatened him with a knife after a . confrontation outside a shop. In . a police interview played to the court, the boy said the defendant . swore at him and his friend in the street as they threw cans around. After they confronted him, the teenager pulled out a knife, the boy said. 'I thought I was going to die,' he said. 'I wanted to cry.' The boy, who can not be named, said he was 'skimmed' by the weapon as he crouched down to pick up his scooter. 'It looked really sharp,' he told police. 'He was aggressive, he wanted to do it.' The . defendant, who has Asperger's syndrome, denies a charge of possessing . items for the purpose, preparation and instigation of an act of . terrorism. Targets were alleged to include Loughborough University and five other sites in the area . They include nine . partially assembled petrol bombs, a quantity of commercial firework . powder, a quantity of part-assembled pipe bombs, partially constructed . improvised explosive devices (IEDs), quantities of commercial . pyrotechnic fuse cords, a stab proof vest, a gas mask, three 0.22 air . rifles, one Olympic 0.22 blank-firing pistol and a quantity of . ammunition, one 0.22 air pistol, three BB guns, a black military belt . containing air gun pellets and a silver cartridge, and one note book . containing information about the planning and construction of explosive . devices, it is alleged.

Jailed: Daniel Olley left his victims - some of them mothers - feeling 'foolish, shattered and betrayed' A conman who plundered cars and money from vulnerable women he met on dating websites was yesterday jailed for almost four years. Daniel Olley, 45, of Ipswich, Suffolk, left his four victims - some of them mothers - feeling ‘foolish, shattered and betrayed’ for allowing themselves to be fooled by his lies, a court was told. One of the women was left so penniless that she could not afford to buy new winter clothes for her children after former mechanic Olley - who has previously been sentenced for similar offences - stole hundreds of pounds from her. And another mother had to get a taxi to visit her son in hospital after Olley stole her car. Olley, who was living at a Kingsley Guest House in Ipswich, admitted offences of theft from four women and fraud relating to selling their cars. He carried out the crimes between October and December last year, Ipswich Crown Court heard. Jailing him for 46 months, Judge David Goodin said there was a ‘cynical cruelty’ to his offending and told him: ‘You are in effect a cautionary tale for vulnerable women’. The judge said what Olley had done to the four women, three of whom he met on dating websites, was ‘horrid in the extreme’. Where he stayed: Olley, who was living at a Kingsley Guest House in Ipswich, admitted offences of theft . Charlotte Davison, prosecuting, said one of the women who met him online was told by him he was a car trader. He offered to sell her vehicle after she told him she had a £1,100 debt that had to be paid. He took her vehicle and after days of making excuses to her she did not see him or her car again. The woman told police she had lost confidence and weight as a result of the way Olley treated her. Another woman who had met him through a dating website was told by Olley he had a garage in Bury St Edmunds, had recently sold his home for £200,000 and was looking for somewhere to live. 'You are in effect a cautionary tale for vulnerable women' Judge David Goodin . Olley told her that her car needed work doing to it and was not safe to drive. He sold the car and the woman later found a folder containing its documents was missing from her home. The woman told police she was depressed, embarrassed and angry after being tricked. A third woman who also met Olley on a dating website agreed to lend him £250. But after giving him her bank card and PIN she discovered he had withdrawn £300 - and he later took out another £250. Catherine Bradshaw, defending, said Olley accepted the offences were confidence tricks. She said he also accepted that his victims were women looking for relationships and he had exploited them. It was not clear on which dating website Olley met the women, although in a previous case last year in Chelmsford, Essex, involving similar offences, he was revealed to have used Plenty Of Fish. In that case in May 2012, he pleaded guilty to seven counts of fraud and was sentenced to 18 months in prison - only months after being released from jail for further similar offences.","Daniel Olley, of Ipswich, left his four victims feeling 'foolish and betrayed'

Smoke alarms have a tendency to be triggered by something as simple as burning toast, which means you're left waving a towel frantically in front of the sensor to silence the shrieking noise. The smart alarm from Nest Lab has been designed to put an end to this debacle, but 'without compromising on protection'. Called Nest Protect, the device will give a spoken Heads-Up warning that can be silenced by a wave of the hand before sounding a traditional warning alarm. It can also be linked to mobile devices and can warn homeowners even when they're out. The Nest Protect alarm, pictured, gives a spoken Heads-Up warning about imminent dangers that can be silenced by a wave of a hand. If the warning is not silenced, the device will sound a traditional noise. It has heat, carbon monoxide and smoke sensors built in . Nest Protect has built-in heat, carbon monoxide and smoke sensors. If Nest Protect sees that smoke or carbon monoxide levels are rising but have not yet reached emergency levels, it will give an early warning. This can be silenced by a wave of a hand. Nest Protect connects to mobiles over Wi-Fi and will text homeowners to warn them of danger, or when the batteries are low. In an emergency, the What to Do feature reminds users of recommended actions and gives a one-button access to an emergency phone number. Additionally, if a homeowner fits . multiple alarms in different rooms of a house, Nest Protect can alert them to which room in particular the danger has been detected in. This may not be necessary when detecting smoke from a fire, but has been designed to warn specifically for the dangers of carbon monoxide. 'We’ve all experienced the smoke alarm going off while we’re cooking or searched for the source of that incessant low-battery chirp in the middle of the night,' said Tony Fadell, Nest founder and chief executive officer. 'Every time a smoke alarm cries wolf, we trust it a little less, and then - in a moment of frustration - we rip the batteries out to stop the beeping. And that leaves us and our families at risk.' Nest Protect, pictured left, can also connect to mobiles over Wi-Fi and will text homeowners to warn them of danger when they are out, or when the batteries are low. The Nest app is available for iOS and Android . Nest Protect goes on sale in November and costs £109. It will come in two versions - a wired 230V device as well as a battery-powered alarm . Studies have shown that 80 per cent of homes in the UK own a smoke alarm, but in one of eight house fires attended by fire and rescue services, had smoke alarms that failed to work. This is largely caused due to flat or missing batteries that have been removed because of chirping alerts. 'Safety shouldn’t be annoying,' added Matt Rogers, Nest founder and vice president of engineering. 'It was unacceptable to us that one in eight houses in the UK have a non-functioning smoke alarm. 'These products are required by law and are supposed to keep us safe, yet people hate them. We wanted to change that.' The Nest app is available on iOS, Android and online, and can also be used with smart Nest Learning Thermostat. It is due to go on sale in November and will cost £109.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 07:08 EST, 10 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:11 EST, 10 October 2013 . Badgers could be gassed by the government after a planned cull failed to kill enough of the animals, Owen Paterson said today. The Environment Secretary yesterday blamed the badgers for 'moving the goalposts' after marksmen culled fewer than half the 2,000 animals targeted. Now he has admitted the government is 'looking at gassing', amid reports that some of the animals had already been gassed illegally. Target: Thousands of badgers are being culled in pilots which ministers say will help curb the spread of TB in cattle herds . Officials yesterday announced a new, lower estimate of the badger population, making it . easier to hit the 70 per cent target for culling. But a six week-cull in Somerset which ended on Sunday will have to be . restarted, with opponents accusing the government of ‘adjusting the . figures to make it look like this is a success’. Mr Paterson complained that the badgers . themselves were making the cull more difficult than expected. 'The . badgers moved the goalposts. We're dealing with a wild animal, subject . to the vagaries of the weather and disease and breeding patterns,' he . told BBC Spotlight. Trouble: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson blamed the badgers for the cull falling short . Today he defended the much-ridiculed remark, saying he was 'stating the screamingly obvious'. He went on to confirm that gassing is now being considered. Speaking in the Commons Mr Paterson . told MPs: 'Until we can establish vaccines, we have to use the tools . employed by other sensible countries which is to remove wildlife. We . made it quite clear in our TB strategy that we would look at other . methods of removing wildlife. 'And yes we are looking at gassing, but we will not use it unless it is proven to be safe, humane and effective.' But Labour condemned the idea. Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle said: 'Gassing badgers has been proven to be inhumane and it is unacceptable for Owen Paterson to be considering it, just because his unscientific, costly and misguided cull is not working. 'Instead of blaming the badgers for the failure of his policy, it’s time for a coherent plan to eradicate TB through vaccination of both badgers and cattle, together with tougher rules on the movement of livestock.' Badgers are blamed for . spreading tuberculosis (TB) in cattle herds, and the coalition ordered . pilot culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire to curb the disease. The . aim was for marksmen to kill 70 per cent of badgers by free shooting, . which meant culling 2,081 of the 2,400 animals in Somerset. But officials now admit just 850 badgers were shot during the six-week trial. The Gloucestershire trial is due to end next week. In . an attempt to claim the plan is working, ministers now say the badger . population is only 1,450 – meaning 59 per cent of the animals have been . killed. Opposition: Campaigners from the Somerset Badger Patrol looking for marksmen in the village of Monksilver, Somerset . The trial culls could now be extended by up to three . weeks to give the marksmen more time to meet their targets. The . original 5,000 target was based on 2012 estimates of badger . populations. But newer research showed numbers had now . fallen by around a third, because of flooding, food scarcity and . disease. Badger expert Professor Rosie Woodroffe said the failure to kill enough animals meant the trials should now be stopped. She . said: ‘When you kill badgers two things happen. The first is there are . fewer badgers, and for disease control that should be a good thing. ‘But . also you change the behaviour of badgers in ways which increase the . transmission of disease in badgers, so each badger is more infectious to . cattle... They are more likely to travel, and they are mixing more with . badgers from other social groups.’ Meanwhile, Gavin Grant, RSPCA chief executive, said: ‘Frankly this whole situation is a farce. ‘Whatever the figures, it is clear that the system has failed.’ Despite . widespread opposition, the Government has been committed to the . controversial scheme, which it hopes will help limit the spread of . tuberculosis in cattle. Queen guitarist Brian May said figures . showing the number of badgers killed were ‘widely disparate’, and urged . ministers to abandon the ‘ridiculous’ cull.","Owen Paterson defends claim that badgers 'moved the goalposts'

Three drunken stockbrokers who brutally assaulted a clubber after they harassed his girlfriend have been jailed. Archie Madden, 21, Vinny Sullivan, 22, and Simon Abouzaki, 30, repeatedly kicked Edward Blackman as he lay helpless on the ground outside the Rose Club in central London. The victim was rushed to hospital but miraculously suffered only a black eye and bruises, Southwark Crown Court heard. Assault: Edward Blackman (right) was kicked and punched after he asked his attackers to stop harassing his girlfriend Camilla Sverdrup-Thygeson (left) Madden - who counts The Only Way is Essex star James ‘Arg’ as a Facebook friend - was jailed for 60 weeks while Sullivan was locked up for 10 months. Abouzaki, who once received a bravery award for assisting a girl who was being attacked, was jailed for a total of 18 months after a suspended sentence for possessing MDMA was activated. A fourth broker, Faisal Khan, 22, who started off the shameful brawl by throwing two punches at Mr Blackman, was handed a community order with 150 hours unpaid work. Sentencing, Judge Alistair Mcreath said: ‘I have been in criminal law for many, many years and over those years I have dealt with cases of murder where the attack on the deceased person is far, far less serious than the attack you perpetrated on Mr Blackman. ‘To put a man to the ground as three of you did and then to kick him as he lies on the ground is an exceedingly dangerous thing to do and people die because of it. ‘By sheer good fortune the injuries suffered by the victim of your attack were relatively slight and nothing like the injuries that they could have been. ‘It’s absolutely plain from the CCTV footage your intention was to cause him much greater harm than you actually did. ‘I don’t expect for a moment you recall that intention because you were the worse for drink. Guilty: Vinny Sullivan (left) and Archie Madden (right) were jailed for 10 months and 60 weeks respectively . Crime scene: The attack on Mr Blackman took place outside the Rose Club in London's Mayfair . ‘I have no doubt that you are very sorry for what you did but I’m bound to say you are sorry for the predicament you find yourselves in rather than remorse for what you did.’ Sullivan and Madden appeared shocked as the sentences were passed while family and friends sobbed in the public gallery. Abouzaki waved to his relatives while Khan showed no emotion. Describing the attack on February 2, prosecutor Peter Zinner told the court: ‘Mr Blackman and his Norwegian girlfriend were together in a night club in the small hours of the morning. ‘The four defendants approached her and began to make suggestions to her that she might be interested in seeing rather more of them. ‘Mr Blackman intervened and asked them to stop, then the fight broke out. Mr Khan threw two punches but they didn’t cause any injury. Mr Blackman made off with the three others in hot pursuit. ‘He was then attacked by the group and subjected to numerous punches and kicks. Faisal Khan at Southwark Crown Crown Court: He narrowly avoided jail, but was given a community order for throwing two punches . ‘This was a sustained assault on a defenceless and helpless victim who suffered black eyes and bruising, not by design but by good fortune.’ Mr Blackman, from St Albans, told The Evening Standard that he thought his attackers were thugs in the wrong part of town and was astonished to find out they were stockbrokers. He called for them to be barred from working in banking. He said: 'For someone to do what they did to me, you have to question how much of a responsible adult they are and their character. It was such a violent attack that I thought they must be thugs in the wrong part of London, but I was amazed when I found out they were stockbrokers. The violence was horrendous. 'It’s the lifestyle of people who are making a lot of money at a young age, in a short space of time. A lifestyle driven by alcohol, cars and women. 'It’s amazing that young brokers are trusted to manage large accounts – what checks are in place? They hopefully will not be allowed back into that industry.' Brian Stork, defending Abouzaki, said he ‘bitterly regrets’ his behaviour and the harm caused to Mr Blackman. Tim Brown, for Madden, told how the attack was an ‘isolated one off incident’. Naeem Karbhari, for Sullivan, said he was ‘disgusted’ with himself and has since curtailed his drinking. ‘He hoped to calm things down but allowed himself to get involved.’ Michelle Denney, for Khan, added: ‘He is a broker and of good character. ‘His best mitigation is his limited involvement and remorse.’ Madden, of Epping, Essex; Sullivan, of Barking, Essex and Abouzaki, of Waterloo, South East London, all admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Khan, of Woodford Green, Essex, admitted common assault.","Edward Blackman was attacked outside the Rose Club in central London .

An enormous and territorial elk has wandered into a Wyoming town and taken up residency in the streets as he prepares for the annual rut. Bewildered employees can only watch from the windows in fear as the bull strolls proudly past their front steps. People having been giving the giant elk a wide berth as he strutted past the Post Office and medical centre. They called police to keep the testosterone-pumped animal at bay. Testosterone-pumped: Residents in Mammoth Hot Springs are giving this enormous male elk a wide berth as he searches for female moose . Wrong way? Every year elk come through the town. The cows graze on the lush grass and the males are looking to mate . Every autumn, elk spend the afternoon and evenings walking the streets of Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. Occasionally, as many as 40 or 50 arrive together, attracting huge crowds who watch on with curiosity, awe and fear. Wildlife photographer and writer Keith Crowley, 52, was there to capture the action last month. He said the elk will stay in town for up to several weeks at a time as autumn marks the start of the mating season. This enormous bull is one of the first of the season, eager to start the rut . Don't mess with him: The elk are territorial and can be aggressive in autumn, so park wardens have to spend most of their time protecting tourists from injury . Mr Crowley, from Wisconsin, said: 'The cows come to graze on the lush grasses in town. 'The bulls, such as the one in these photos, follow since autumn is the heart of the annual breeding season, known as ""the rut"". 'The bulls sniff anything and everything they come across, looking for smells that tell them a cow is ready to be bred.' The frustration and rising testosterone levels means the male elk are prone to damaging vehicles and property as well as injuring people. Security threat: Police were called to monitor this magnificent bull, to ensure nobody got hurt . Bulls view everything as a potential threat to their herd dominance and will frequently attack vehicles that stop near them . According to Mr Crowley, some people will photograph them from their cars but this can be incredibly dangerous. He said: 'They bulls view everything as a potential threat to their herd dominance and will frequently attack vehicles that stop near them. 'This is common though as Mammoth Hot Springs is the busiest town in Yellowstone National Park and is the headquarters for park operations. 'Because it is so busy with tourists and park employees, evenings in town during the elk rut are quite chaotic. 'Park rangers spend most of their time trying to prevent injury to the visitors and property.'","Residents in Mammoth Hot Springs stay indoors as a giant elk struts past .

A stalker who has terrorised a young woman for two years has been freed from court and allowed to live next door to her. Darren Blee, 22, plagued Pippa Dowson by following her day and night, hiding in bushes and jumping out in front of cars she was in. Blee, who lives with his parents, admitted an ‘unhealthy fixation’ with the 20 year-old and told police he could not stop himself from following her. Stalker: Darren Blee (pictured), 22, told police he could not stop himself from following Pippa Dowson day and night and had an 'unhealthy fixation' with her . He pleaded guilty to stalking but was given a suspended sentence and left to return to his home in Truro, Cornwall. Ms Dowson, who lives alone, said: ‘My life has been ruined for nearly two years and he got a slap on the wrist. ‘My safety is compromised. His feelings were taken into consideration over mine.‘It’s disgusting. I think it’s horrendous that they have just let him go home right next door to me.’ Garth Richardson, prosecuting at Truro Crown Court, said police first told Blee to stop his harassment in July 2012, followed by a caution in November. He behaved himself for three months until February when he started following Ms Dowson again. On one occasion she came home to find Blee screaming at her and making animal noises. When asked by police why he kept following her, he said: ‘I don’t know why, there is something wrong with me but I don’t know what. I can’t stop myself.’ Dieter Kehler, defending, said Blee found it hard to make friends or interact with people. New laws were introduced last November which recognised stalking as a specific crime with a potential sentence of up to five years. 'He threw things at my window at home. It’s been absolutely terrifying. From the beginning of this year it's been absolutely horrendous' - Ms Dowson . Blee was the first person in Cornwall to be dealt under the new legislation which Ms Dowson hoped would finally protect her. He was remanded in custody by magistrates at the end of August when he pleaded guilty to stalking involving serious alarm or distress. But he was freed when he returned to the crown court to be sentenced and got a nine-month prison term, suspended for 12 months, and an order to do 100 hours of unpaid work. Blee was also given a restraining order not to contact his victim, go to her work or follow her for five years. However, he was allowed to continue living with his parents in the house next door to Ms Dowson.After the hearing Ms Dowson told how her nightmare began in January 2012 when she was just 18 years old. She had never had any previous contact with Blee before he targeted her out of the blue. She said: ‘I noticed he was following me everywhere I went and it got to the stage where I could not leave the house by myself. Verdict: Truro Crown Court gave Blee a suspended sentence and allowed him to return home, next door to his stalking victim . ‘He threw things at my window at home. It’s been absolutely terrifying.’ Ms Dowson alerted police who spoke with Blee but that failed to stop him. She added: ‘From the beginning of this year it’s been absolutely horrendous. ‘He was getting cockier and cockier. Twice he jumped out in front of a car I was travelling in which was terrifying. I started to think he was not going to stop. ‘It changed my life. I couldn’t do anything without being watched.’ Ms Dowson said she was determined to continue with her life as normally as possible despite the unwanted attentions of Blee. She said: ‘The effect it had on me was life-changing. But if I’m not strong now, it’s going to go back to me being a complete mess again. ‘Hopefully, now other people are aware of what this man is capable of.’","Darren Blee admitted having an 'unhealthy fixation' with Pippa Dowson .

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 08:10 EST, 10 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:40 EST, 10 October 2013 . Famed NFL coach Mike Ditka has revealed that his biggest regret was deciding not to run against Barack Obama for the open Illinois Senate seat in 2004. 'Biggest mistake I’ve ever made. Not that I would have won, but I probably would have and he wouldn’t be in the White House,' Ditka said at a recent event. Ditka is a legend in the state as he was a player for the Chicago Bears football team during their 1963 championship season and then came back to coach the team, leading them to their most recent championship as coach in 1986. Putting their differences aside: President Obama hosted the 1985 Bears team, which Mike Ditka coached, to the White House in 2011 since they did not get their original ceremony in 1986 due to the Challenger explosion . In 2004, Republican Senator Peter Fitzgerald left the federal government and Jack Ryan was seen as the GOP front runner for much of the campaign. CNN reports that Ryan ended up dropping out with little time left in the race after legal papers revealed that he and his ex-wife went to sex clubs and he asked her to perform sex acts in front of other patrons. Ryan subsequently dropped out of the race and the local Republican political machine called on Ditka to run. 'He’s enormously popular. I think if he gets in, he immediately becomes a favorite,' then-Democratic nominee Obama said at the time, according to The Daily News. Ditka's high approval ratings along with his self-described 'ultra-ultra-ultra conservative' political leanings would have made him an ideal candidate for the party, but he decided against it. Citing his wife's disapproval of a run and his business obligations, Ditka formally announced that he would not be the Republican candidate just four months before the election. His biggest regret: Ditka was pushed by the local Republican machine in 2004 to run against virtual unknown Barack Obama for the open Senate seat in Illinois but in July he announced that he would not run (pictured) That same month, Obama gave the keynote address at the Democratic National Convetion where John Kerry was formally nominated as the party's presidential candidate. The speech was well received, launching him onto the national politcal scene and helping secure his landslide victory against his Republican challenger, former Ambassador Alan Keyes. One term later, Obama was elected President, and four years after that he was re-elected, bringing us back to present day. Now, while attending an oil field opening ceremony in North Dakota, Ditka lamented on his decision though he still seems fairly content with the life he has. 'If somebody would have told me 40 years ago they’d pay you to be on TV, I would have said ""You’re crazy,""' Ditka said according to The Dickinson Press. Well-versed: Ditka is one of two people in NFL history to win a title as a player, assistant coach, and head coach (seen at left in 1963 and at right in 1982 as coach) 'They pay me to be on TV and talk about something I like to talk about, football. That’s almost insane.' The two men have clearly put their . differences aside since Ditka had some kind words for the President when . he honored the 1985 Bears team at the White House in 2011. They were . initially supposed to have a ceremony in the year after their victory, . but the Challenger space shuttle explosion cancelled those plans. 'On . behalf of the 1985 Chicago Bears, we consider him one of us. We're very . proud that you honored us by bringing us here. It's only 26 years after . the fact, and five administrations, but thank you,' Ditka said at the . ceremony, according to ESPN..","Famed Bears coach Mike Ditka was seen as a possible Republican candidate for the Illinois Senate seat in 2004 .

The owner of a truck stolen and written off by a nine-year-old boy two days before he evaded airport security to fly half-way across the country today hit out at the soft treatment he got from police. Just 48 hours before the unnamed boy made national headlines for his audacious flight to Las Vegas after sneaking past three levels of security he stole a delivery truck belonging to a noodle company in Minneapolis. The boy took the truck and then went on his own demolition derby up a windy uphill road near a farmer's market, and plowing into several cars including a police cruiser in downtown Minneapolis after a short chase with authorities. The boy's father said they his son had thought he was playing video game 'Grand Theft Auto'. Scroll down for video . Troubled youth: It has emerged that the boy stole this truck and crashed it after a short police chase . String of dramas: The truck incident happened just two days before the boy boarded the flight to Las Vegas . Troublesome: As well as stealing the car, the boy also has a history of playing truant and sneaking into a local water park without paying entry . Ultimately the car chase and crash caused $5,888 in damage, Edina police spokeswoman Kaylin Martin said. But the treasurer of the noodle company whose delivery truck was totalled thinks if cops and prosecutors hadn’t treated him with kid gloves he wouldn’t have had the opportunity to skip town. ‘They can’t charge him,’ Mei Dang, treasurer of United Noodle Company told MailOnline. ‘If they didn’t release him maybe he wouldn’t be in Las Vegas.’ Dang, of United Wholesale in Minneapolis told MailOnline she's down a delivery truck and upset that the youth was freed. 'The police are doing nothing so what can we do? They released him and he's probably going to go out and damage more property. Indeed, cops let the joyrider walk after he was cited for motor vehicle theft, damage to property, and reckless driving among others, records show. It's unclear if the boy will face formal charges given his young age, officials said. Dang recalled being shocked last Tuesday around lunchtime after learning that one of her delivery trucks had been taken from their lot as pallets were being unloaded. Heartbreak: At a press conference this afternoon, the father, pictured, with a black hoodie and baseball cap pulled down over his face, said the family were 'heartbroken' when they learned what their son had done . 'The keys were in the truck after making deliveries and my driver was bringing his invoices into the office and when he went back the truck was gone,’ she said. Dang rang 911 and told the dispatcher that the 9-year-old was heading downtown. 'They caught him right away,' she said. How the youngster managed to go unseen to joyride in the noodle truck remains a mystery. 'I have no clue, Dang said. 'He just walked in from the side.' When cops nabbed the boy they initially thought he was a teenager. 'At first they think he was 14,' she said. 'But days later they put it together and realized he's really young. They said he was only nine and he's in Las Vegas.' More... Father of boy, 9, who sneaked onto Las Vegas flight sobs as he describes how he begged for help with his troubled son but was told child 'hasn't done enough' Today the boy’s father agreed with Dang. He claims he pleaded with cops about his soft-treatment after the truck theft. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, the father, who mummified his face with black t-shirts to protect his identity and that of his son admitted that he’s ‘not perfect’. But he claimed that his hands were tied by authorities who threatened to throw the book at him if he carried out threats to beat the boy. ‘I asked the [police]officer ‘Please sir, will you watch me whoop his butt?’ He claimed he was told he’d be thrown in jail if he struck his son. ‘The officer told me “If we see you hit your son we're going to have to lock you up.”’ I said, ‘Sir, what can I do? I've been asking for help and no one's helping me. ‘I’m in what's called double jeopardy.  If I whoop my son I get locked up. If I let my son go on doing what he's doing I get in trouble.’ Support: V.J. Smith, right, of anti-violence group MAD DADS sat next to the distraught father, left . At one point the father choked up and said he was begging for help to turn his son’s life around. ‘Please help me. Please.’ The father said that his son's erratic behavior was escalating even as young as five-years-old, but denied claims that his boy was taking medication. Even before he boarded the Delta flight to the national embarrassment of the TSA, there were plenty of tell-tale signs of the child’s troubled upbringing. In an email titled ‘private data’ dated from last December Janine Moore, who works for the county’s Human Services and Public Health Department, described the boy to fellow administrators as ‘challenging’, The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. Moore added that there ‘was a pattern of behaviour’ and that the kid couldn’t be trusted. ‘Typically, staff can tell if a child is lying, but with this child they are unsure what is going on. This is a two-parent home, and there is at least one other child.’ In her memo, Moore wrote that the boy's future could go two ways. If he's been mistreated, he could be removed from his home. If he has a mental health issue, there could be a 'behavioral health response,' which she didn't explain. The parents are raising three kids, including a 14-year-old daughter and an infant. The boy’s prolonged absence was hardly an event at his spare, bungalow-styled home located on the southern edge of North Minneapolis. Leaving: The runaway boy flew to Las Vegas from Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport on a Delta plane like this one, pictured. It was only discovered mid-air that he had no ticket . His parents thought the child had taken out the garbage and went to play at a friend’s house. In fact, the child had made it to Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport by himself, slipped through a security checkpoint and then boarded a Delta Air Lines flight before he was discovered by suspicious flight attendants. It was only after their son had already landed in Las Vegas and been taken into protective custody by police and child services there, did the parents called 911 and filed a missing person report. The boy is believed to have left his entire family in the dark to his hi-altitude Houdini act. Contrary to reports, his mother, who works for an airline, insists she did not help her son get on the flight. The boy's father works for a bus company. Few family members have spoken to him and it’s unclear when or if he will be coming back home as he remains in custody of child services in Las Vegas. Destination: Las Vegas McCarran International Airport, with the 'Strip' in the background. The nine-year-old flew here from Minneapolis without a ticket . Reached at her home on Tuesday the boy’s mother, who requested anonymity, told MailOnline she was floored along with the rest of the world when she learned her son had runaway out of town on an airplane. ‘I was just surprised in general that a child could do those things,’ she said. ‘Its crazy.’ The mother of three said her son is ‘smart’ but added that the family needs closure. ‘I feel bad but things happen in life and you move on.’ She also dumbfounded that her son’s charade has grabbed almost as many headlines as the federal government shutdown. ‘This is the second headline next to the shutdown in Washington D.C,’ she said.","Boy went on dramatic demolition derby in stolen truck two days before getting on flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas .

There are around 120-130 cases of mucosal melanoma diagnosed each year in the UK, according to Cancer Research UK. In this case, however, once doctors discovered the man's black gums were due to cancer, they removed the affected parts of the gum plus a 2cm margin of the surrounding area, according to the case notes.

Officers had been called to the girl's home Sunday afternoon after her family had reported her bleeding heavily. Scroll down for video .

When they arrived, they discovered the teenager, who has not been identified due to her young age, bleeding profusely. Family members said they had found the placenta but couldn't locate the child, prompting a panicked search.

The Colorado parents whose four children could only communicate in grunts when they were found living in a feces-ridden home previously had three other children taken from them, it has emerged. Wayne Sperling, 66, and Lorinda Bailey, 35, were arrested and charged with four counts of felony child abuse after their four sons, aged two, four, five and six, were found living in a home littered with cat feces, flies and urine in Denver last month. Records have now revealed that the couple also had three other children taken away from them in 2006 when they were discovered living in similarly appalling conditions during a welfare check. Police were called to the home after two of the children, then aged two and four, were seen playing in the road and officers found the apartment door open, with only an upstairs neighbor watching them with a sound monitor, the police report shows. Charged: Wayne . Sperling, 66, and Lorinda Bailey, 35, were charged with child abuse after their sons were found in filthy conditions. They pleaded guilty to child abuse in 2007 after 3 other kids were also mistreated . Officers found that the eldest child was unable to speak properly and would only grunt and point, USA Today reported. The children's faces were black with dirt and they were hungry and surrounded by trash, rotting food and insects, the criminal complaint noted. They were wearing unwashed clothing and 'reeked', it said. Sperling and Bailey arrived home shortly afterwards with their three-month-old child and all three children were taken and put in protective care. There are no details about their current whereabouts but they have different birth dates from the most recently found children, and records show all seven are the children of Sperling and Bailey. Lashing out: Lorinda Bailey shouts at reporters while walking from the Denver Justice Center on the first day of her hearing on Tuesday. Her four malnourished sons were found living in a feces-covered home . The couple was later charged with . three counts of child neglect and both pleaded guilty to a single . misdemeanor count of child abuse in 2007 and were placed on probation . for two years. They were also ordered to take parenting classes and Sperling was ordered to undergo a mental-health evaluation, but it is not known if they fulfilled these requirements. In the incident last month, police went to the home after Bailey took her two-year-old son to the hospital for a cut on his head, and doctors noticed he was dirty and smelled of cigarettes. At the home, police officers reported a . strong smell of a decomposing animal coming from inside. They said the . 'smell became unbearable' as they entered the apartment. They added that the smell seemed to be coming from a . back room that was so full of flies 'they were covering every surface'. They also found two inches of cat . feces under the bunk bed where the boys had slept. 'Sick': In 2006, Bailey's children were found covered in dirt and hungry after neighbors saw them playing in the road. She and Sperling were put on probation and ordered to take parenting classes . The children could only communicate with each other using 'infant-like noises', the report noted. It also claimed all the children . seemed to be about the same size, and they could not tell the age or . developmental differences between the three oldest children. Two of the youngsters were wearing nothing but diapers. Bailey waived her right to an attorney and 'stated she did not think the apartment was bad and stated she had seen Sperling clean and mop the floors,' the report said. The children were placed in protective custody and all four were given medical examinations. Sperling . and Bailey have been charged with four counts of felony child abuse. Bailey, who is free on bond, appeared in court Tuesday while Sperling . remains in custody. They are scheduled to return to court for a preliminary hearing October 29. Questions: Family attorney David Littman, pictured in his law office opposite the home in Denver, said he called child welfare about concerns he had about the children - but that calls were ignored . Scene: A man walks past the residence of Sperling, where the four boys were found in deplorable conditions. Police records show that officers had previously responded to complaints . Since the recent case emerged, further records have revealed that child welfare knew about problems at the home for more than a year. Caseworkers and police officers had even visited the home in Denver, Colorado but concluded the boys - who had to sleep on urine-soaked beds with no sheets - were 'fine', police reports show. A family attorney, David Littman, who worked across the street from the home added that he called child welfare about the children after he saw them partially-clothed but his call was ignored. Denver . County Department of Human Services officials said they could not . discuss the case because of privacy laws and the state child welfare . division opened a review of the incident.","Wayne Sperling, 66, and Lorinda Bailey, 35, accused of child abuse after their four sons were found in deplorable conditions in Sperling's home .

The ex-wife of a man who shot dead five schoolgirls seven years ago revealed today the unforgettable moment when members of the Amish community her husband brought to its knees actually offered her their condolences. Marie Monville appeared on Piers Morgan Live on Wednesday, where she described for the first time how quickly the family of her husband Charlie Roberts were able to forgive. 'He said that they had forgiven Charlie and that they were extending grace and love to our family. They were concerned about me and concerned about our children,' she said. Scroll down for video... Touching: Marie Monville, the wife of the Amish schoolhouse shooter, appeared on Piers Morgan Wednesday and revealed the unbelievable moment she was embraced by the victims' families . The way they were: Charlie Roberts opened fire on a one-room school house in 2006. Monville has since forgiven him, and so have the Amish families of Lancaster county, she said . Marie Monville was married to Charlie Roberts, 32, when he opened fire at an Amish . school in rural Pennsylvania on October 2, 2006. Mrs Monville, who has since remarried, has now written a book in which she recounts the fateful morning and the fallout thereafter. Amazingly, . the Amish community actually helped Monville and her family through the . trauma. It began with a visit to her parents' Lancaster County home. 'I . saw some Amish men walking down the street. I knew they were coming to . my parents' house. And I went to my mom and dad and said, ""what do I do? Do I go out to talk to them,""' she said on Piers Morgan. The deeply religious Monville, who is now remarried, revealed to Piers Morgan that she has moved on, thanks in part to the unbelievable forgiveness shown by the Amish families her husband nearly shattered . Marie and Charlie Roberts pictured on their wedding day in November 1996. Ten years later, he shot dead five little Amish girls in a one-room school in rural Pennsylvania . She continued: 'My dad said, ""you can . stay inside, I'll go out and talk with them."" He knew them. You know, . they were from our community.' In an unbelievable display of forgiveness, Monville watcher the Amish men hug her father. 'I . couldn't hear the words they spoke, I saw the embrace,' she said. 'I . saw them put their arms around my dad and put their hands on his . shoulder. Everything about their gentleness conveyed the words that I . couldn't hear.' 'I love the relationship I have with those families,' she said, calling their compassion 'unending.' 'There were several families that had said to me, ""You know, at the end of the day, we have our spouse, we have each other to lie in each other's arms and cry but you don't have anyone. And we think about you when you go to bed at night and you're all alone,""' Monville told the Christian Post. 'And that was the most profound thing that someone ever said to me, that they were able to see the really intimate places of my heart and the pain that I endured and to know that they were thinking about me at the end of the day and what my life looked like was really amazing.' Their ability to forgive was an inspiration for the deeply religious mother. 'I couldn't figure out any way for God to rescue us,' she said, but 'I knew that God was firm.' Coming to terms with tragedy: Marie Roberts Monville was married to Charles Roberts when he shot dead five girls in an Amish schoolhouse and injured five others seven years ago this week . Her milk truck driver former husband, who was not . Amish, singled out girls aged between six and 13 in his deadly attack - . ordering the male pupils and teachers out of the classroom before he . lined-up and shot the children one-by-one in the head. The couple's first child had died in 1997 just 20 minutes after she was born three months prematurely. Unexplained: Roberts, 32, shot dead five little girls and seriously injured five others before turning the gun on himself . She told GMA: 'And in some way he felt like he was getting back at the Lord for the loss that we had sustained.' Roberts . also made the chilling admission in his letter that he had molested two . relatives although police could not prove any attacks had taken place. The father-of-three had acted normal . on the morning of October 2, 2006. He had returned home from his night . shift at 3am and rose to wave his own two children off to school. Marie Roberts, as she was then, left the house soon after and returned to find rambling suicide notes written by her husband. She managed to speak to him briefly . on his phone soon after but didn't understand fully what was happening . until police arrived at her door. 'It was a gorgeous day, one of those Indian Summer days. We walked down to . the bus stop with the kids and he kissed them and said he loved them,' she said. 'I didn't understand the scope of what was going on until the police . came to my door. They said that Charlie had walked into the schoolhouse, . that he held the girls hostage and shot them and five of them died . before he shot himself. 'To know that the man who walked down to the bus that morning and kissed . his own kids and said that he loved them was capable of hurting someone . else's children was unfathomable - yet there was no way to say that it . didn't happen, because it just had.' The . shootings devastated the devout Amish community of Lancaster County . isolated from the modern world with no television or cars to spread the . message of what happened. Tragedy: Five schoolgirls were shot dead in Roberts shooting attack after he barricaded himself in to the one room schoolhouse. Police believe he intended to molest his victims but shot them instead when police disrupted his plan . In mourning: These little girls were pictured at the funeral for Roberts' five victims, all aged between 6 and 13 . As news spread, grief-stricken families began to arrive at the one room schoolhouse in their traditional buggies and horses. Five . couples were to be told their little girls had died while Marie Roberts . had to gather together her three children to try and explain what had . happened. 'My son was five and he was outside playing in the backyard,' Marie says in the film. 'The windows . were open and the breeze was blowing in with the sounds of their . laughter and playfulness. 'I just soaked in that moment thinking, 'Is this going to be . the last time I ever hear this? In a matter of minutes I'm going to . have to shatter their world and tell them something no parent would ever want to say.  Am I ever going to hear . them laugh again?' Funeral procession: The community was devastated by the multiple shootings in rural Pennsylvania in 2006 . 'I drew them in and we sat there together in the . silence of that moment almost as if - if we were quiet enough the world would change, but it didn't.' The gunman's former wife penned a book about coping in the aftermath of the tragedy . Reports at the time suggested that Roberts told his wife in their last phone call that he had molested children in his family 20 years ago and was going to do it again. Police said they believed this was his intention in taking the girls hostage but was stopped by the arrival of police to the scene. He had barricaded the door shut and lined the girls up in front of a blackboard and bound their feet. Police attempted to negotiate with him before he fired the deadly shots using a handgun and shotgun. He killed Naomi Rose Ebersole, seven, Anna Mae Stoltzfuz, 12, Marian Fischer, 13 and sisters Mary Liz and Lina Miller, eight and seven. The most severely injured survivor of the schoolhouse attack remains . unable to eat, sit or talk. In December, the victims parents wrote to the families who lost children in the Sandy Hook massacre. Shooting: A similar classroom in an Amish school near to Nickel Mines. The victims were aged 6 to 13 and included two sisters . Herman Bontrager, a spokesman for the Nickel Mines Amish . community, said: 'This is a time when the scabs are rubbed raw again.' Mrs Monville has spoken at many churches about what happened and released a book on her experiences earlier this year. Entitled One Light Still Shines: My Life Beyond the Shadow of the Amish Schoolhouse Shooting, she says she hopes it will appeal to others who have suffered 'similar brokenness'. She admits that the months that followed were hard but she relied on her faith to get her through. 'I had never known a place of desperation like that ,' she said.  'There was nowhere . to run nowhere to hide, there weren't any real answers. I was being . looked on by the world to give some kind of answer but for me there was nothing for me to go back to but the Lord. 'It doesn't matter what your circumstances are God is in the midst of them.' When it's someone that you've loved, the lens with which you look at the story is completely different because it is not a story it's your life.' 'I want to invite the reader into my story, knowing that we all have places of similar brokenness regardless of circumstance.  I hope the reader will view their circumstances differently, through the lens of expectancy – looking for God to breathe joy upon the places they need it most and would otherwise expect it least.'

A 13-year-old-boy is due to stand trial in Louisiana on Wednesday, accused of the second-degree murder of his five-year-old half sister. Devalon Armstrong allegedly used wrestling moves he had seen on television on Viloude Louis, who died from the brutal beating on June 16 in Terrytown. The little girl suffered broken ribs, internal bleeding and a . lacerated liver after Armstrong repeatedly slammed her on a bed, punched her in the stomach, jumped on her and struck her with his elbow several times, police said. Tragic: Five-year-old Viloude Louis died of horrific injuries in June, allegedly inflicted by her half brother Devalon Armstrong, as he practiced wrestling moves on the girl . Judge Andrea Price Janzen will hear testimony today and then rule whether the boy will be charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter or negligent homicide. He could also be acquitted. The Times-Picayune reported that if Armstrong was convicted as charged he would get 'juvenile life', which would mean imprisonment until his 21st birthday. The teenager, who is also known as Armstrong Desvallons, told officers that he was practicing wrestling moves on his sister while their mother, 39-year-old Adlourdes Desvallons, was out. But Juvenile Court Judge Janzen will not let prosecutors use the tape where he confesses this as evidence during Wednesday's trial. Victim: Viloude Louis, 5, was found unconscious on the floor after she was brutally beaten . As reported by The Advocate, the judge ruled in September that neither the boy nor the mother really understood how this statement could be used against him. Deputies say they received a 911 call . from the home on June 16 saying the girl had been found unconscious on the bathroom floor. Paramedics found the girl unresponsive and she . was pronounced dead a short time later. Armstrong was arrested after a coroner investigation found the girl died of multiple injuries, two days after the death, Jefferson Parish Sheriff's spokesman Col. John Fortunato said. Detectives initially spoke with the girl's mother and found out that the teenager had been babysitting while she went shopping, Fortunato told The Times-Picayune. Devalon told investigators the girl had a stomach ache and went upstairs to brush her teeth, and 30 minutes later he found her on the floor complaining her stomach still hurt, Fortunato said. Scene: The little girl suffered the beating in this Louisiana neighborhood while her half-brother babysat her . The teenager claimed he took the girl downstairs to the sofa and called 911 when he saw she was no longer breathing. Dispatchers told him to start CPR and paramedics arrived on the scene. The coroner's office said there did not appear to be any outward signs of injury and her death was left as unclassified, but then Devalon told detectives he had been practicing World Wrestling Entertainment-style moves on the girl,  The Times-Picayune reported. He said that even when his little half sister said she was in pain, he continued to carry out the moves on her. Detectives added that he appeared to be enjoying talking about the assault. The Sheriff's office reclassified her death as a homicide and Devalon was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder. He has been held at a juvenile detention center since the incident. Violent: The boy said he used moves on his sister like those he had seen on World Wrestling Entertainment .","Devalon Armstrong, 13, 'repeatedly punched half sister in the stomach, jumped on her and slammed her on the bed as he copied WWE moves'

Manchester Crown Court was told Withnell, who was serving in Greater Manchester Police’s Salford Division at the time, was already been under suspicion of corruption and was a frequent gambler with a ‘lifestyle beyond his means’. The bent officer planned to double-cross Smethurst and keep the cash and had no intention of carrying out the plan. Details of the plot emerged as Smethurst, from Bolton, was given a 15-month sentence, suspended for two years after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice. Withnell who has since been sacked pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of justice and is in custody awaiting sentence. The court heard how the plot was hatched in September last year after Smethurst, who has homes in Manchester and Marbella was was ‘distraught’ to learn the CPS were not proceeding with a complaint of assault she had made against Thomas. She opened a bottle of bubbly and began confiding her woes in a series of text messages to Withnell whom she befriended in a tanning salon he owned in Bolton. Withnell, who had been a police officer for 11 years, suggested to Smethurst via text that he could plant a shotgun in the car of her former lover in exchange for a cash payment of £30,000. She agreed to the plan and they met at a friend’s Manchester flat on the afternoon of October 1. He then left the premises with £19,000 cash as a downpayment on the pretence that the plan was to go ahead. But the following morning she texted Withnell several times saying the deal was off and asked to get her money back. She also contacted another serving policeman she knew and gave him some details about what had happened. He reported the matter to his superiors and counter-corruption police officers then set up a meeting with Smethurst in a Manchester hotel on October 12. She told them about Withnell and gave them her phone so they could access text messages. Manchester Crown Court (pictured) was told Withnell, who was serving in Greater Manchester Police's Salford Division at the time, was already been under suspicion of corruption and was a frequent gambler with a 'lifestyle beyond his means' Withnell was arrested and suspended on October 22 last year. Legal proceedings are now being taken to seize the £19,000 he accepted from Smethurst as proceeds of crime. Sentencing Smethurst, who has now quit the escort industry Judge Michael Henshell said: 'I do not accept the extent of your drunkenness but I do accept you had been drinking. Evidence in your texts seems to indicate you were in full control of your senses.' 'You went along with the suggestion and it is obvious Withnell left your premises with £19,000 and for some time you were of the view that the plan was going to be arranged. 'The next day at 9.17am you made it clear you didn’t want anything to do with the plan and following that you contacted another police officer you knew and reported it to him and he reported it to relevant authorities. 'After that you did assist the police and were interviewed and you allowed the police to take your phone which had the text messages. After the combination of those factors Withnell did plead guilty. 'This is a very grave offence but your offence is mitigated to a great extent by your behaviour afterwards and the short duration it lasted for and the fact it was suggested by Daniel Withnell himself.' Claire Smethurst, pictured in a photograph from her Facebook, who claims judges and barristers are among her clients, was said to have gone on a 'champagne spree' and asked him to plant the goods in Leroy Thomas' car . Withnell has also admitted abusing his position as a serving Greater Manchester Police officer to access a police database and get information from officers investigating a man. The court was told that Withnell, aged 30, of Heaton, did not intend to carry out the plan to plant evidence on Mr Thomas. He has already pleaded guilty to two counts of misconduct in a public office and intending to pervert the course of justice. He is currently in custody and will be sentenced at a later date. Yesterday Judge Henshell sentenced Smethurst to 15 months in prison, suspended for two years. He told her that perverting the course of justice is 'always a very grave offence' but that her criminality was mitigated by her behaviour afterwards, because it only lasted a short time and that the plan was initially Withnell’s, not hers. Legal proceedings are now being taken to seize the £19,000 she paid to Withnell as proceeds of crime.","Claire Smethurst paid Det Con Daniel Withnell a 'bung' of £19,000 .

The face of a killer: Michael Yowell was executed Wednesday after being convicted for the grisly 1998 murder of his parents . A Texas man convicted of brutally murdering his parents on Mother’s Day Weekend during a drug-fueled rampage 15 years ago has been executed. Michael Yowell, 43, shot his father, strangled his mother and blew up their Lubbock home – killing his 89-year-old grandmother – was executed Wednesday via lethal injection despite objections over the drug used for the execution. ‘Punch the button,’ were Mr Yowell’s last words. The convicted killed took a few deep breaths, snored and was dead in about 30 seconds. He was surrounded by witnesses, his ex-wife and daughters. Mr Yowell also took the opportunity to tell his family to tell them he loved them one last time. ‘I love you, to Gerald you're a zero,’ Mr Yowell said, according to KCBD. ‘I love you Mandy and Tiffany. I love you too. Whenever you're ready.’ The 14th execution of the year in Texas, which executes more inmates than any other state, Mr Yowell’s execution was briefly delayed by him joining a lawsuit against the use of a new supply of pentobarbital. With supplies of German-made pentobarbital – the drug used in lethal injections – running dry, Texas and other states have begun sourcing the drug from compound pharmacies. Compound pharmacies, which make custom prescriptions, were thrust recently into the national spotlight after states began looking for alternatives to stocks of pentobarbital because overseas manufacturers refuse to supply it for lethal injection. Executed: Mr Yowell, seen here in 1998, was executed using compounded pentobarbitol . The murder’s lawyers argued all the way to the Supreme Court the custom barbiturate inflicts unnecessary pain and suffering. The appeal was denied and Mr Yowell was executed. The former Lubbock resident was the nation’s first inmate executed with the new supply. The execution comes 15 years after Mr Yowell, high on drugs, went ballistic in his parents’ Lubbock home during Mother’s Day weekend. Already on probation for burglary and drug convictions, the ex-con had a $200-a-day drug habit, officials said. The rampage was sparked when father John Yowell, 55, caught his drug addled son trying to steal his wallet. Michael Yowell shot his father in the . face before savagely beat mother Carol Yowell, 53, before strangling her . with a lamp cord, according to prosecutors. Total destruction: The Yowells' Lubbock, Texas, home exploded after Michael Yowell opened the gas valve . 'Punch the button': Mr Yowell's execution came despite appeals all the way to the Supreme Court . The crazed man then opened a gas valve and fled the home, the ensuing explosion claimed the life of grandmother Viola Davis, officials said. The charred bodies were discovered after firefighters doused the blaze, Mr Yowell was convicted in the deaths of his parents, but not for Ms Davis' death. ‘At some point he's looking his mom in the face, beating her and wrapping a lamp cord around her neck,’ Lubbock County District Attorney Matt Powell, who prosecuted the case, recalled Tuesday. ‘I think always there are some unanswered questions,’ he added. ‘You want to know how somebody is capable of doing that to their parents.’ Mr Yowell was pronounced dead Wednesday at 7:19pm local time.","Michael Yowell, 43, was the nation's first inmate executed using barbitol sourced from a compound pharmacy .

Orders: Ross William Ulbricht, 29, has been sent to New York to face charges for running notorious online drug marketplace Silk Road . A federal judge on Wednesday ordered a California man charged with operating a notorious online drug marketplace known as Silk Road to be sent to New York to face charges. Ross William Ulbricht, 29, agreed to remain in custody, waiving his right to argue for release on bail. His public defender Brandon LeBlanc said Ulbricht will be transferred immediately from his jail cell in downtown Oakland and might argue for release once he reaches New York, where he is charged with three felonies related to the website, including solicitation of murder. Silk Road gained widespread notoriety . two years ago as a black market bazaar where visitors could buy and . sell drugs using bitcoins, a form of online cash. A so-called hidden site, Silk Road used an online tool known as Tor to mask the location of its servers. While . many other sites sell drugs more or less openly, Silk Road's technical . sophistication, its user-friendly escrow system and its promise of . near-total anonymity quickly made it among the best known. The FBI shut down the site when they arrested Ulbricht on Oct. 1 at a small branch library in San Francisco as he chatted online with a cooperating witness, according to authorities and court papers. He is also charged in Baltimore . federal court with soliciting the murder of a former worker who was . arrested on drug charges. The indictment alleges Ulbricht feared the . former worker would turn on him. Black market: Silk Road gained widespread notoriety two years ago as a black market bazaar where visitors could buy and sell drugs using bitcoins, a form of online cash . The FBI said Ulbricht unwittingly hired an undercover agent for the murder, which the FBI staged but never took place. Prosecutors in New York have charged Ulbricht - a native Texan who was living in San Francisco and holds degrees from the University of Texas and Penn State - with trying unsuccessfully to solicit the murder of a Canadian man who allegedly hacked into Silk Road, obtained dealers names and began blackmailing Ulbricht. Ulbricht is accused of operating Silk Road under the alias 'Dread Pirate Roberts' and earning $80 million from commissions involving every sale. LeBlanc has denied the charges against Ulbricht and said outside court on Wednesday that Ulbricht will be represented by another lawyer in New York. LeBlanc declined to say if the attorney will be privately retained or a public defender. Inside, LeBlanc told U.S. Magistrate Court Judge Joseph Spero, 'we ... disavow all aliases' alleged in the government's charge. Rendering: This artist's sketch shows Ross William Ulbricht, right, appearing in Federal Court with his public defender Brandon LeBlanc, left, in San Francisco last Friday . 'All we admitted to is that he is Ross Ulbricht,' LeBlanc said outside court. 'That was the only admission.' Federal defendants must be formally identified before authorities can transfer them. Ulbricht appeared in court shackled at the ankles and wearing Alameda County jail garb. He said 'good morning' to the judge and peered into the packed gallery during the five-minute hearing. FBI agents appear to have penetrated the behind-the-scenes operations of Silk Road and obtained a list of the sites users and sellers, court papers show. Authorities in Britain, Sweden, and the United States have arrested eight people who are charged with using the site to sell drugs. In Washington state, a man and a woman were arrested on charges of selling cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine through the now-shuttered website. In the U.K., the country's newly established National Crime Agency indicated more arrests were on the way. 'These latest arrests are just the start; there are many more to come,' said Keith Bristow, head of the agency. Business: Ulbricht is listed as an entrepreneur on LinkedIn. He is accused of operating Silk Road under the alias 'Dread Pirate Roberts' and earning $80 million from commissions involving every sale . In court papers, the FBI said it had managed to copy the contents of the site's server - something one expert said would likely provide international authorities with detailed information about dealers who use the website. 'Any large sellers on Silk Road should be very nervous,' said Nicholas Weaver, a researcher with the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley and the University of California, San Diego. The traceable nature of bitcoin transfers means the FBI 'can now easily follow the money,' Weaver said in an email.","Ross William Ulbricht, 29, arrested in California and sent to New York to face felony charges including solicitation of murder .

British tobacco manufacturers are fuelling the black market by deliberately over-supplying their products to European countries, MPs have warned. UK firms are supplying more tobacco to European countries than their markets need and the tobacco is then finding its way back into the UK market without tax being paid, costing the country £1.9 billion a year, the Public Accounts Committee said in a report. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), Britain's tax office, is failing to tackle firms who ‘turn a blind eye to the avoidance of UK tax’ through over-supply, which in some countries in 2011 exceeded demand by 240 per cent, the Committee added. The illicit tobacco trade: The route that smuggled cigarettes take and the biggest producers of tobacco . Under supply chain legislation, . tobacco firms have a legal obligation not to aid smuggling but HMRC has . not fined any UK tobacco manufacturer for over-supplying products and . has issued only one letter of warning. Committee . chair Margaret Hodge MP said: ‘The department (HMRC) has also failed to . challenge properly those UK tobacco manufacturers who turn a blind eye . to the avoidance of UK tax by supplying more of their products to . European countries than the legitimate market in those countries could . possibly require. ‘The tobacco then finds its way back into the UK market without tax being paid. ‘The supply of some brands of hand-rolling tobacco to some countries in 2011 exceeded legitimate demand by 240 per cent. ‘HMRC must be more assertive with these manufactures. So far it has not fined a single one of them.’ Illicit: Customs & Excise said more than 80 per cent of the smuggled . cigarettes that end up on Britain's streets come from outside the EU. It costs the taxpayer £1.9 billion a year according to a report . Under the 2010 Spending Review, HMRC did plan to launch a project to test how well manufacturers were preventing the over-supply of tobacco products to high-risk countries, such as Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. But during the planning stage, HMRC . realised that UK officials could not exercise their powers in another . country in that way and the project was scrapped. The Committee also said HMRC was failing to deter potential tobacco smugglers through its use of prosecution powers. It . said: 'HMRC has not made full use of the range of enforcement actions . available to it in dealing with those involved in the illicit tobacco . trade, or challenge adequately UK tobacco manufacturers that fail to . prevent the over-supply of their tobacco products to countries from . which they might be smuggled back into the UK.' Losing out: Tobacco smuggling is costing the country £1.9 billion in lost taxes, according to a report by the Public Accounts Committee . According to Customs & Excise, more than 80 per cent of the smuggled cigarettes that end up on Britain's streets come from outside the EU, from places such as the Far East, the Middle East and the Balkans. Tobacco fraud cost taxpayers £1.9 billion in 2010/11, the Committee said, with nine per cent of cigarettes and 38 per cent of hand-rolling tobacco sold in the UK estimated to be sold on the black market. But the group of MPs said there were ‘only’ 265 prosecutions for tobacco smuggling in 2012/13 and prosecutions for organised crime fell from 62 to 51 in the last year. HMRC does not know what level of enforcement action is needed to deter would-be offenders, the group of MPs added. Ms Hodge said: ‘HMRC is in the dark about the deterrent effect of its enforcement action. Challenge: MP Margaret Hodge said HMRC has failed to challenge tobacco companies who turn a 'blind eye' to UK tax avoidance . ‘Despite the seriousness of tobacco fraud, in 2012/13 there were only 265 prosecutions for tobacco smuggling and, in the last year, prosecutions for organised crime actually fell from 62 to 51.’ She added: ‘Tobacco smuggling is not a victimless crime. ‘Each year it constitutes a theft of revenue to the tune of some £1.9 billion, 20 per cent of the total sum collected through tax. ‘It undermines drives to cut smoking and is also linked to the activities of organised crime.’ The group of MPs recommended HMRC and Border Force should publicise prosecutions and other enforcement action more widely to deter potential offenders. The Committee said HMRC had made some ground tackling tobacco smuggling, with estimates showing a drop for illicit tobacco products between 2000/01 and 2010/11. The expansion of HMRC's network of overseas intelligence officers has been particularly successful, preventing £226 million of lost tax in the last two years for an initial investment of £4.6 million, it added. But the group of MPs found HMRC's proposals to tackle tobacco smuggling in the 2010 Spending Review investment were ‘over-optimistic’ with three of the five projects delivering no benefit by March 2013. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We have more than halved the size of the illicit market in cigarettes. In the last two years alone nearly 3.6 billion illicit cigarettes and over 1000 tonnes of rolling tobacco have been seized resulting in 432 prosecutions. ‘Disrupting criminal businesses is at the heart of HMRC's strategy to clamp down on this illicit trade. The tobacco smuggling gangs are constantly adapting to the huge downward pressure HMRC puts them under. This pressure has caused the long term decline of this illegal trade. ‘Additional investment has been made by this Government to tackle tobacco smuggling, and our officers posted overseas have made a significant contribution to the drive against smuggling as the PAC recognises. ‘The Government is reinvesting nearly £1 billion in HMRC to continue the fight tackling evasion, fraud and avoidance.’","Supply to come countries exceeds demand by 240 per cent, MPs said .

T-Mobile have announced that they will no longer hit customers with added fees for use of their text and data services when they are abroad. In a bid to woo international users, they will also cap charges for international voice calls. Starting from the end of this month, customers of T-Mobile's flagship Simple Choice plan will not be subject to the data roaming charges which can see the cost of phone bills soar during trips overseas. The controversial fees can reach hundreds or thousands of dollars for a single trip even when customers travel to neighboring Canada or Mexico. The communications company, which is the No. 4 U.S. cellphone carrier, has been trying to distance itself from their rivals by ditching the standard practice of cashing in on international services. Branching out: The mobile company are looking to distance themselves from their competition with the announcement . They have even branded themselves the 'Un-carrier' in a bid to break clear from the established pack. The company sounded their intentions to break with tradition in March this year when they dropped conventional two-year service contracts in favor of installment based contracts. In July, it introduced a program that lets people upgrade phones up to twice a year, a move that rivals AT&T, Verizon and Sprint were quick to follow. T-Mobile CEO John Legere said their change of approach to data charges was a move gain more customers without sacrificing profits. He said that because the company does not have currently have many international customers, they are not making huge profits from the sky-high data roaming fees which are common today. According to NBC, Legere said that by offering to cap call fees and cut data and text charges altogether, the company could attract a new type of customer without losing out on what they already make. New custom: By ditching their data roaming charges, T-Mobile believe they can lure international callers from other, more pricey, networks . T-Mobile have also planned to grow their revenue with by offering higher-speed roaming plans at $15 for a day or $25 for a week. The free plan will be good enough for basic internet use. But the paid option will give customers the option of watching high-definition video and using other streaming services. T-Mobile's forward thinking changes appear to have already benefited the company since shorter contracts and quick upgrades were introduced this year. T-Mobile US Inc. added a net 688,000 good credit and long-term customers in the latest quarter, compared with a loss of 557,000 in the same period a year earlier. That boost was in part due to the launch of Apple's iPhone on the service, which they provided for the first time in April. The new plan is likely to appeal to customers who travel frequently to any of the covered countries. Major countries on every continent except Antarctica will be covered and officials say the list includes the vast majority of the places Americans visit. Added extras: Users who wish to access data streaming services can pay for better internet access abroad . In addition to free data and texting while traveling in those countries, customers will pay a flat rate of 20 cents per minute for voice calls to any of those same countries or the U.S. T-Mobile and other carriers now charge $1 or more a minute in many countries. For an additional $10 a month, customers will also get free calling from the U.S. to landlines in more than 70 countries. Calls to other countries in the program or to other mobile phones will be 12 to 20 cents a minute, the company said. Data roaming will be where customers save most but there will be some limits for frequent travelers. Any trip abroad needs to be six weeks or less, and customers need to spend at least half their time in the U.S. in any three-month period meaning that the tariff is not for for students spending a year abroad, for instance. T-Mobile also announced Wednesday that its high-speed 4G LTE network now reaches 200 million people in 233 metropolitan areas. Legere said the company's network might not be as good as rivals in every rural pocket in the U.S., but it's fast in major cities.","Fees for calls to neighbouring Canada or Mexico can hundreds of dollars .

A thug who shoved a pensioner off a bus, causing him to smash his head on the pavement which left him in a coma lasting several weeks, has been jailed. Derek Thomson, 27, attacked retired Royal Navy seaman Frederick Fenn, 67, following a row between the pair on a bus in Ipswich. When Thomson bundled his victim into the street, the sound of Mr Fenn's head colliding with the ground was described in court as like 'a water melon hitting concrete'. Thomson had denied grievous bodily harm, but the Ipswich man was found guilty and jailed for three years yesterday at Ipswich Crown Court. During the trial, the jury had been told that Mr Fenn sustained 'life-changing' injuries when he was set upon by Thomson during the brutal assault last December. He was described as 'independent, . confident and active' but since the attack had been completely different . and appeared to relatives to be 'removed from reality'. Mr Fenn, who had also served in the Merchant Navy, spent several weeks in a coma at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, before he regained consciousness and was moved to Ipswich . Hospital. The pensioner had been out for lunch on the day of the attack, and was returning to his Ipswich home by bus at about 6pm when trouble flared. Bus driver Jonathan Bethell said Mr Fenn had initially got off the bus, but had then got back on again. He explained Mr Fenn was then bundled backwards off his bus, which was at a standstill, by a man. He added: 'He pushed him backwards out of the open door of the bus.' Mr Bethell described the horrible sound of . Mr Fenn's head hitting the ground as like 'a water melon hitting . concrete'. Thomson claimed in court he had been acting in self defence and had not deliberately pushed Mr Fenn off the bus.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:06 EST, 10 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:06 EST, 10 October 2013 . Now in terrible health: Tarek El-Sawah, seen in this undated photo, is morbidly obese and in danger of dying at any moment, according to his lawyers . Tarek El-Sawah is in terrible shape after 11 years as a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay, a fact even the U.S. military does not dispute. Lawyers for Mr El-Sawah, and the doctors they have brought down to the U.S. base in Cuba to examine him, paint a dire picture — a morbidly obese man with diabetes and a range of other serious ailments. He is short of breath, barely able to walk 10 feet, unable to stay awake in meetings and faces the possibility of not making it out of prison alive. 'We are very afraid that he is at a high risk of death, that he could die at any moment,' said Marine Lt. Col. Sean Gleason, a military lawyer appointed to represent him.Details about the condition of Mr El-Sawah, who has admitted being an al-Qaeda explosives trainer but is no longer facing charges, are emerging in a series of recently filed court motions that provide a rare glimpse into the health of an unusual prisoner, and a preview of arguments that may become more common as the Guantanamo Bay prison ages into a second decade with no prospects for closure in sight. He's not the only one of the 164 prisoners at Guantanamo who is seriously ill. Last week, a judge ordered the release of a schizophrenic Sudanese man who spent much of the past decade medicated in the prison psych ward. His lawyers argued he was so sick, with ailments that also included diabetes, that he couldn't possibly pose a threat and therefore the U.S. no longer had the authority to hold him. The judge's ruling came after the government withdrew its opposition to his release.There's also a Pakistani prisoner, Saifullah Paracha, with a heart condition serious enough that the government brought a surgical team and a mobile cardiac lab to the U.S. base in Cuba to treat him, at a cost of $400,000. He ultimately refused the treatment because he didn't trust military medical personnel.In addition, two prisoners have died from natural causes — one from a heart attack, the other from cancer. And several detainees have raised medical complaints related to their participation in a long-running hunger strike, which had dropped to 17 prisoners as of Monday from a peak of 106 in July. Also in rough shape: Ibrahim Idris (left) and Saifulla Paracha (right) are also in poor health, said their lawyers . 'There are a whole slew of people with a whole slew of serious health problems,' said Cori Crider, a lawyer for the British human rights group Reprieve who has been meeting with Guantanamo prisoners for years.U.S. officials say Guantanamo prisoners get excellent medical care, saying proudly that it's equivalent to what troops receive. There are more than 100 doctors, nurses and other professionals treating ""a constellation"" of illnesses, said Navy Capt. Daryl Daniels, a physician and the chief medical officer for the detention center. He says none is in critical condition at the moment.'They are an aging population and they are starting to show some signs of being an older group of people,' Mr Daniels said. No escape: Prison cells in Guantanamo Bay camp 6 where prisoners are housed in a communal facility . In August, lawyers for Mr El-Sawah filed an emergency motion with a federal court in Washington asking a judge to order the military to provide what it calls 'adequate' medical care, including additional tests for possible heart disease and a device to help him breathe because of a condition they say is preventing his brain from receiving enough oxygen.The government insists he is getting good care at Guantanamo and just needs to exercise more and eat less. 'While (Mr El-Sawah) is currently in poor health, his life is not in imminent danger,' lawyers for the Justice Department wrote in response.The judge hasn't ruled, but the request is secondary anyway. What Mr El-Sawah and his lawyers want is for the U.S. to release him, preferably back home to Egypt. They argue in part that his health is too poor for him to pose any kind of threat. 'It boggles the mind that they are putting up a fight on releasing him,' Mr Gleason said. Let him go: Multiple prison officials have recommended Mr El-Sawah for release because of his declining health . Mr El-Sawah, who is 5 feet, 10 inches, was around 215 pounds when he arrived at Guantanamo in May 2002 after his capture in Afghanistan. Photos from before his capture show a man with a bit of girth but not in apparently ill health. One of his lawyers, Mary Petras, says he was obese by the time she first met him in March 2006.'When he first got to Guantanamo 11 years ago he was not obese,' Mr Gleason said. 'And during those 11 years he was under the custody, control and medical supervision of the United States government.'Mr El-Sawah at one point faced charges of conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism. The government withdrew those charges and told his lawyers that prosecutors had no intention of filing them again for reasons that have not been made public. He has reportedly cooperated with interrogators and court documents contain redacted passages dealing with his time in custody but his lawyers decline to comment on the issue.His lawyers hope to either to win a ruling either from the court or from a review board of government officials that will be re-evaluating the prisoners in custody. Mr El-Sawah has received letters of recommendation from three former Guantanamo commanders, a rare, if unprecedented, string of endorsements. In better times: El-Sawah, in this undated photo, was once in much better health than he is now . In one letter, retired Army Maj. Gen. Jay Hood called him a unique prisoner who was 'unlike the violent Islamic extremists who formed much of the population at Guantanamo.' Another, Rear Adm. David Thomas, noted his 'restricted mobility due to obesity and other health issues' in recommending his release.Most striking is a letter from an official whose name and job title are redacted for security reasons. He spent several hours a week with the prisoner over 18 months at Guantanamo and says Mr El-Sawah has been 'friendly and cooperative' with U.S. personnel. 'Frankly, I felt Tarek was a good man on the other side who, in a different world, different time, different place, could easily be accepted as a friend or neighbor.'","Tarek El-Sawah is short of breath, barely able to walk and cannot stay awake in meetings .

Merlin Quinnan stole a rabbit and a guinea pig after a boozy night out - only to realise what had happened when he woke up to find them scampering around his bedroom, a court heard. Merlin Quinnan, 21, (pictured) broke into a woman's garden and took the animals from their hutches . Hapless Quinnan, 21, broke into a woman’s garden and took the startled animals from their hutches. The next day, when he realised what had happened, he put pictures of them on Facebook and tried to sell the animals for £10. Quinnan, of Redruth, Cornwall, admitted the theft as well as stealing a mountain bike and four offences of criminal damage to cars and a motorcycle. Quinnan found the animals (not pictured) hopping round his room . He was sentenced to a 12-month community order with an alcoholic treatment scheme requirement for six months at Truro Magistrates Court. He was also ordered to pay £210 compensation - including £10 to the owner of the rabbit. The bizarre theft echoes a similar incident in February. Anthony Campen, 29, kidnapped a chicken from a nearby primary school before dragging it to a houseparty where he posed with it before releasing it into the wild. Police used the pictures to force Campen to admit his crime after he posted a number of photos on Facebook. Pupils at the Bishops' Church of England and Roman Catholic Primary School in Chelmsford, Essex, had believed their pet chicken, called Olympia, had escapedbefore they began to suspect foul play. Campen, from Chelmsford, Essex, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal sometime between January 26 and 28 this year 2012 when he appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates Court on February 20.","Merlin Quinnan broke into a garden and took animals from their hutches .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 08:40 EST, 10 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:52 EST, 10 October 2013 . A Conservative backbencher who tried to derail David Cameron’s EU policy has been left humiliated after more than 140 MPs from his own party demanded he abandon his challenge. Adam Afriyie, a self-styled future Tory leadership contender accused of plotting against the Prime Minister, wanted to amend legislation allowing for an in-out referendum by 2017. But he faces unprecedented pressure to withdraw his amendment after scores of Tory MPs elected in 2010 warned him it would ‘jeopardize’ the government’s bid to reshape Britain’s relationship with Brussels. Embarrassing: More than 140 of the 147 Tory MPs first elected in 2010 have warned Adam Afriyie he must drop his challenge to the referendum bill . Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate a ‘fresh settlement’ with the European Union, before staging an in-out vote before the end of 2017. A backbench bill introduced by Tory MP James Wharton will seek to enshrine the plan into law, but faces opposition from Labour and the Lib Dems. However, at the weekend Mr Afriyie said the public was ‘not convinced’ Mr Cameron would stick to his promise and demanded the referendum be held in 2014. As Downing Street vowed to block his bid to amend the bill, Mr Afriye declared: ‘I didn't come into politics to be popular.’ Now he has come up against almost every Tory MP elected in 2010. In a letter signed by more than 140 of the 147 who entered Parliament for the first time at the last election, Mr Afriyie is warned he must respect the overwhelming opposition to his plans. Legislation: Stockton South MP James Wharton has tabled a backbench bill which would enshrine the referendum into law . ‘Delivering a referendum on our membership of the EU is, as you have said, essential,’ the letter states, according to the Spectator. ‘We believe that the bill before the House provides in its current form the best opportunity to secure this outcome, in part because of its uncomplicated, unambiguous nature. This gives the Bill the best chance of progressing through the House. ‘So, whilst we recognise the sense of urgency reflected in your amendment, we feel that this will jeopardize the progress of legislation and the prospect of a referendum. ‘Knowing that you value and respect the views of colleagues we hope and request that you withdraw support for the amendment tabled in your name.’ Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was elected in 2010, said: 'Adam is a man of great charm and intelligence who has been a hugely successful businessman but in this instance his political antennae have malfunctioned.' Andrew Percy, another Tory elected in 2010, said: 'Let's hope Adam Afriyie sees sense and drops his wrecking amendment to the EU Referendum Bill. Conservatives must unite to deliver EU referendum.' Long-serving Conservative Sir Edward Leigh, a strong supporter of a referendum, said trying to change the Bill now would be like trying to throw a 'gallon of poison' over it. When Mr Afriyie’s amendment emerged at the weekend prominent Eurosceptics privately expressed anger that they may be forced to choose between wrecking Mr Wharton’s bill, which they support, and voting against a referendum for which they have campaigned for years. Promise: Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to hold an in-out referendum by 2015 if he is still in power after the general election . MPs also expressed incredulity that Mr Afriyie appeared not to have discussed the plan with any of the leading Eurosceptics. Philip Davies, who launched the Better Off Out group in 2006, spoke for many: ‘Should there be a vote, I would be compelled to support it since it’s something I have campaigned for all my career. ‘However, I’ve never known Adam Afriyie care about the subject in his life. It’s totally self-indulgent behaviour. He’s going to put lots of my colleagues in a very difficult position.’ If Mr Afriyie had hoped to use his gambit to boost his chances of succeeding Mr Cameron, it appeared to have failed, with Tory MPs queuing up to condemn his grandstanding.","David Cameron promised an in-out referendum after the next election .

A Texas mother has been arrested after she threw her child out of the car on a busy freeway and ordered him to walk home. Angela Garcia, 34, was arguing with her 10-year-old son and decided to punish him by having him make his own way down a freeway southeast of Houston. The boy walked in the dark for about 15 minutes before authorities stopped him, League City police said. Local police received a report of a child walking on the freeway shoulder at around 8.30PM. The police vehicle that picked him up eventually encountered Ms Garcia, parked on the shoulder of the Interstate 45, known as Gulf Freeway. She had been driving 300ft in front of the boy, but he had not been able to see the car as it was dark outside. League City Police has charged Ms Garcia with Abandoning or Endangering a Child after the incident. ‘Making your child walk home on I-45 at 8.30 at night in the dark, in a busy stretch where many fatalities have occurred that is crossing the line,’ League City Police Officer Reagan Pena told MyFoxHouston.com. ‘It's on a major roadway. There are many cars going, it's also a stretch of freeway we've had many fatalities in the last month.

Either take care of your kids or you don’t have any.’ High-risk punishment: The boy was picked up by police by the Interstate 45 (pictured) after he had walked on the freeway shoulder for 15 minutes . One of Ms Garcia’s neighbours told the website it was a surprise to hear of the incident, and said it was out of character for the mother-of-two. ‘I can’t believe it. They are a nice family,’ the neighbor said. ‘The boys are so nice.’ Garcia, a resident of League City, held Tuesday at the Galveston County jail on a $7,500 bond. The boy and his brother, who was also travelling in the car, have been released into the custody of their father.","Mother, 34, forced her son to walk along the freeway after argument .

A transgender conman who pocketed £130,000 by tricking more than 100 people into buying shares in a fake company has been jailed for five years. Frances Harris, 74, of Brighton, East Sussex, who was previously known as Frederick, persuaded investors to plough their savings into an investment opportunity backed by multi-millionaires. She used the names of rich businessmen to lure in people, who were then sold shares in a bogus company called The Golden Age Project - which she claimed was based in Spain, but did not exist. Jailed: Frances Harris, who was born a man (left) but lives as a woman (right), was sentenced to five years after being found guilty of fraud, money laundering and fraudulently claiming £27,000 in benefits, police said .

Graham Lewis, Rosemary Nye and Harris set up Rest . Assured Property Services in 2010 and sold timeshare apartments by . phone. Victims paid a fee they were told was needed before a sale could . be completed. Around 100 people lost their life . savings. Harris was also convicted of using his dead sister Pamela’s . passport to illegally claim £27,000 in benefits - despite her dying . around 50 years ago. Harris, who has breast implants, . gained £130,000 from the scam but his accomplices - husband and wife . team Rosemary Nye and Graham Lewis - raked in more than £700,000 between . them. Lewis, from Haywards Heath, was jailed . for four and a half years for four offences of fraud by false . representation and eight offences of money laundering.

People across the . country reported losing a total of at least £500,000 which has never . been recovered, a police spokesman said. Sentencing: Frances Harris, who has breast implants, gained £130,000 from the scam . Defending Harris, Nicholas Fooks, said . his client could not complete the full physical change to become a . woman because they had cancer. He said: ‘He cannot complete the . physical change from a man into a woman… The prison is trying its best . to protect him but it’s impossible to protect him 24 hours a day.’ The court heard that mother-of-two Nye . and Lewis used the profits to go on a honeymoon to Dubai, as well as . buy lavish gifts and fund their child’s driving lessons. Defending Nye, Andrew Jefferies QC, . said she only took part in the dishonesty because of her links to Lewis, . who she is now separated from. ‘She believed his background was in . business,’ she said. ‘It was all plausible.

Lincolnshire County Council alone reported pay-outs totalling more than £358,665. King Lane in Leeds, the B6273 in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, and Holly Lane in Banstead, Surrey, were highlighted by councils as among the worst roads for potholes. John Bilbrough, 79, of King Lane, said: ‘Our street and the neighbouring ones are appalling for potholes. ‘The council resurfaced all of King Lane four years ago, but it’s still in a shocking condition. ‘I reported a pothole that must have been 15 inches long, 12 inches wide and four inches deep.

With King Lane now being named as one of the worst, hopefully something will be done about it.’ Britannia’s report described road maintenance as ‘severely under-funded’ with around £16 per driver – less than 10 per cent of the annual road tax bill – spent on road surfaces and fixing potholes.

Officers were left bemused after they rushed to a pub garden to rescue what had been reported as a man trapped upside down in a field... but discovered it was in fact an entry in a village scarecrow competition. The two officers were called to The Plough Pub, in Little Bourton, Oxfordshire, after a member of the public spotted the pair of legs sticking upside down in the ground. But when officers arrived they discovered the 'emergency' was in fact a scarecrow. 'Emergency': Pub landlord Sam Harrison, 60, created the scarecrow, which was meant to be a man who had fallen down a molehill, for the local scarecrow competition . Pub landlord Sam Harrison, 60, had created the scarecrow, which was meant to depict a man who had fallen down a molehill, for the local scarecrow competition which was raising money for charity. As well as the fake legs, Mr Harrison had also placed another molehill nearby with a giant mole sticking its head above the ground. Mr Harrison admitted police were not amused with the prank when they responded to the emergency call last Sunday night. He said: 'Our scarecrow was one of 14 made by villagers in Little Bourton for a competition to raise money for a cancer charity. 'It was a man fallen down a mole hole and a giant mole.

Rules are increasingly relaxing on people wanting to travel on planes with prescription marijuana. Recent reports show that those who have recently presented prescription identification at airports in certain states have been allowed to travel without any issues, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML). ‘I think it shows that TSA primarily is acting as it was intended when it was established, to protect all of us when we travel on the airlines and to thwart terrorists. Pot on planes?: Reports say travellers bringing medical marijuana on planes have been allowed to travel . Getting through: People travelling with pot have been allowed on planes, as long as they show their marijuana license . Keith Stroup, the founder of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, says people have been allowed to travel with marijuana without any issues . ‘It is not supposed to be an anti-drug agency,’ said Keith Stroup, an attorney and founder of NORML, to ABC News. Twenty states have legalised marijuana for medical purposes and two have given recreational use the green light, which causes some confusion at airports. The TSA, or Transportation Security Administration, states on its website that local law does not apply to them. ‘Whether or not marijuana is considered 'medical marijuana' under local law is not relevant to TSA screening, because TSA is governed by federal law and federal law provides no basis to treat medical marijuana any differently than non-medical marijuana.’ ‘What nobody feels 100 per cent comfortable with is it's a grey zone you're going through. It's technically still illegal even though they aren't enforcing it very strongly,’ Stroup said. But whether the herbs in question will be turned over to local authorities is at the discretion of the TSA, and historically responses have varied on a case-by-case basis.

Flying with weed: Irvin Rosenfeld smokes medicinal marijuana to help deal with the pain from a bone disease. He says he has flown many times with marijuana . Irvin Rosenfeld, 60, had been prescribed medical marijuana for 19 years for a painful bone disease when he was prevented from boarding a flight in 2001, according to a lawsuit he filed against the Delta Air Lines in March 2003. The Tamarac stockbroker was set to fly from Fort Lauderdale to Washington, DC, to attend a US Supreme Court hearing on medicinal marijuana when Delta prohibited him from flying with the drug. Rosenfeld said he alerted Delta that he would be traveling with marijuana when he booked the ticket. He said Delta had welcomed him to travel with the drug in the past, understanding that he needs it to ease his pain. At the time, Rosenfeld was one of eight people in the United States legally allowed to use marijuana. The suit was dropped in 2002 because a federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled that citizens can't file private suits against airlines under the Air Carrier Access Act, created to guarantee access to flights for people with disabilities. According to the TSA, their screening procedures are governed by federal law. ‘If during the security screening procedures an officer discovers a item that may violate the law, TSA will refer the matter to a law enforcement. ‘Law enforcement officials will determine whether to initiate a criminal investigation. TSA's focus is on terrorism and security threats to the aircraft and its passengers,’ they told ABC News.","People with proper prescription ID for pot have been allowed to travel in some states, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .

An actor is suing the Met Police for £50,000 accusing them of picking on him as a suspected drug dealer because of his colour. Daniel Kaluuya, 24, who has appeared in TV drama Skins and starred as Rowan Atkinson’s sidekick in the film Johnny English Reborn, claims he was pinned down, strip searched and accused of obstructing an officer. In papers lodged with the High Court he is demanding substantial damages for his mistaken arrest on a London bus by officers, one of whom is said to have placed a boot on his head as he was pinned to the ground. Angry: Actor Daniel Kaluuya claims he was pinned down, strip searched and accused of obstructing an officer in Camden, London and is suing the Met Police for his mistaken arrest . Mr Kaluuya, who won an Evening Standard theatre award as outstanding newcomer in 2010, claims he was 'was singled out because of officers racially stereotyping him.' He also accuses the Met of using false reports from officers to mount a ‘malicious’ prosecution that accused him of obstructing a police officer. He later walked free from court after the Crown Prosecution Service offered no evidence. Mr Kaluuya says his ordeal began after he was taken off a bus in Camden Town, pinned to the ground by the officers before being later strip searched at Kentish Town police station. He was returning home on January 11, 2010, when he was taken off a bus soon after boarding at about 8.45pm. Officers told him he fitted the description of someone acting suspiciously in the area. Daniel Kaluuya (bottom) s demanding substantial damages for his mistaken arrest on a London bus by officers, one of whom is said to have placed a boot on his head as he was pinned to the ground . Mr Kaluuya asked whether he had been singled out because he was black. In the papers he says a male and a female officer were 'aggressive from the outset' and 'intimidating'. The . pair backed him against a shop window before pinning him to the floor . and restraining him, helped by up to five colleagues after they radioed . for help. He had his hands and legs cuffed and his trousers pulled down. Mr Kaluuya alleges he was kneed in the back, neck and head, kicked in the legs and stomach and had his head and shoulder stamped on. When he refused to reveal his name, more force was applied via the boot on his head. He is suing Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, on behalf of the force, for 'loss of liberty, personal injury, damage and humiliation' He was ordered to walk to the police van but fell over twice because his trousers were round his knees. Mr Kaluuya adds officers failed to read him his rights and refused to inform his mother he had been taken to the police station. It was the first time he had been held in custody. He spent four hours in a cell and was subjected to a strip search, during which nothing was found. His fingerprints, DNA and photograph were taken. Now he is suing Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, on behalf of the force, for 'loss of liberty, personal injury, damage and humiliation.' He says he went to his GP several days after the incident and was told he had internal bruising to his ribs, chest and back. He denies police claims he became aggressive when they tried to arrest him. At the time he was held Mr Kaluuya, who lives with his mother, had already appeared in Skins and played minor roles in Dr Who and Lewis. He subsequently played Agent Tucker, the sidekick to Rowan Atkinson’s character Johnny English, and appears in new movie Kick Ass 2. He won the Standard theatre award for his role as a boxer in the Royal Court play Sucker Punch, and also starred in A Season In The Congo at the Young Vic. He said the police ordeal was a detriment to his career because he missed auditions. In the past he has tweeted about police mistreatment, without specifically referring to his experience, especially during the 2011 summer riots. His solicitor Jocelyn Cockburn, of Hodge Jones & Allen, said: 'Daniel will not be making any comment at this time because of the ongoing case.'

A pair of Russian multi-millionaires apparently went head to head to see who could splash the most cash in a top Mayfair bar - ending up with a combined bar bill of more than £130,000. Owners of Kitsch London claim the mystery pair spent a small fortune trying to outdo each other in just three hours on the club's opening night. According to onlookers, two arch rivals, in their 30s, racked up a bar bill that would buy a one-bed flat in the capital in just a few hours - and didn't even drink it all. Head to head: The unidentified Russians tried to outdo each other with more and more extravagant orders. The first man (left) racked up more than £20,000 on Dom Perignon alone as well as ordering cocktails. The second man managed to win the 'challenge' however, by ordering more than £40,000 of Cristal . The men arrived just before midnight and started ordering large numbers of Dom Perignon and Cristal champagne. Every time one table would order a set of drinks the other man would add more on his next order to beat the other. By the end of the night, the bills were an eye-watering £66,778.91 and £64, 279.70 - making a grand total of £131,058.61. The first man's bill for £66,778.91 included 30 Magnums of Cristal, 20 Bottles of Dom Perignon, 20 Crack Baby shots, six Espresso Martinis, 10 shots of 18-year-old Glenmorangie whiskey, eight bottles of mineral water, seven bottles of 1998 vintage Krug champagne and two magnums of Belvedere vodka. The other bill for £64,279.70 included 64 bottles of Dom Perignon at £325 each which came to £20,800 on its own. There was also 25 bottles of Crystal champagne, 16 of Armand de Brignac Ace of Spades champagne, 12 bottles of Dom Perignon Rose, 7 Mohitos, 10 bottles of Peroni, 20 cans of Red Bull, six Bellinis, six bottles of water, two bottle of Chivas 18-year-old whiskey, six bottles of Krug Grande Cuvee, and eight bottles of Belle Epoque Rose. Revellers: Clubbers at Kitsch were treated to entertainment from burlesque dancers and circus performers . The bar was shut just before 3am and when the totals were added up the table that had won by just short of £2,500 were reportedly jumping up and down ecstatically waving their bill in the air. One onlooker at the club said: 'It was one of the most bizarre nights I’ve ever seen. 'These two guys were competing with each other to buy more and more champagne each time one would buy five bottles the other would order six, then seven, then eight. 'I’ve seen stuff like this once before in St Tropez where there’s a bottle war but never like this in London before. 'Every time a set of bottles of champagne would come out they would be carried by waitresses wearing next to nothing and there with sparklers everywhere. 'There were so many bottles and sparklers is was as bright as a summers day at some points of the night.' Risque: Burlesque performers danced at the club opening where the incredible bill was racked up. Decadent: Animal-themed performers and burlesque dancers entertained the crowds . Owners: Hip hop promoter Serg Ivo (left) and club owner Mark Fuller(right). An onlooker called the spending spree 'bizarre'. The bills included 84 bottles of Dom Perignon . He added: 'There was a massive crowd of stunning women around each table in no time at all, and frankly these guys needed some help drinking all this booze anyway.

Scientists believe a gene involved in the regulation of the 'happy hormone' serotonin may predict a happy marriage . Some say the secret to a happy marriage is compromise, or to never go to bed on an argument. But American psychologists now declared that the key to wedded bliss may actually be in our DNA. They believe a gene involved in . the regulation of the 'happy hormone' serotonin can predict how much our emotions affect our . relationships. The study, from the University of California, Berkeley, and Northwestern University, may be the first to link . genetics, emotions, and marital satisfaction, the researchers say. Senior author of the study, UC Berkeley psychologist Robert W Levenson, said:  'An enduring mystery is, what makes one spouse so attuned to the emotional climate in a marriage, and another so oblivious?' 'With these new genetic findings, we now understand much more about what determines just how important emotions are for different people.' Specifically, researchers found a link between relationship fulfillment and a gene variant, or 'allele', known as 5-HTTLPR. All humans inherit a copy of this gene variant from each parent. Study participants with two short 5-HTTLPR alleles were found to be most unhappy in their marriages when there was a lot of negative emotion, such as anger and contempt, and most happy when there was positive emotion, such as humour and affection. By contrast, those with one or two long alleles were far less bothered by the emotional tenor of their marriages. 'We are always trying to understand the recipe for a good relationship, and emotion keeps coming up as an important ingredient,' said Levenson, who heads up a study that has tracked over 150 married couples for more than 20 years. The new findings don't mean that couples with different variations of 5-HTTLPR are incompatible, the researchers note. Instead, it suggests that those with two short alleles are likelier to thrive in a good relationship and suffer in a bad one. The results of the study, which looked at . the genotypes of more than 100 spouses and observed how they interacted . with their partners over time, bore this out, they said. 'Individuals with two short alleles of . the gene variant may be like hothouse flowers, blossoming in a marriage . when the emotional climate is good and withering when it is bad,' said . Claudia M. Haase of Northwestern University and lead author of the . study. The researchers found a link between relationship fulfilment and gene variant called 5-HTTLPR. Couples who both had a short 5-HTTLPR had the most unhappy marriages - whereas those with one or two long variants were less bothered by the emotional ups and downs of their marriages . 'Conversely, people with one or two long alleles are less sensitive to the emotional climate.' 'Neither of these genetic variants is inherently good or bad,' she added. 'Each has its advantages and disadvantages.' Participants in the study belong to a group of 156 middle-aged and older couples whose relationships Levenson and fellow researchers have followed since 1989. For this study, participants provided DNA samples, and researchers matched their genotypes with their levels of marital satisfaction and the emotional tenor of their interactions in the lab setting. For spouses with two short 5-HTTLPR alleles, who made up 17 percent of the spouses studied, researchers found a strong correlation between the emotional tone of their conversations and how they felt about their marriage. For the 83 percent of spouses with one or two long alleles, on the other hand, the emotional quality of their discussions bore little or no relation to their marital satisfaction over the next decade. The study is published online in the journal Emotion.","U.S. scientists believe a gene involved in .

Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was sentenced today to 28 years in prison for corruption, after a series of scandals destroyed his political career and helped steer a crisis-laden city even deeper into trouble. Kilpatrick, who served as mayor from 2002 until fall 2008, fattened his bank account by tens of thousands of dollars, traveled the country in private planes and even strong-armed his campaign fundraiser for stacks of cash hidden in her bra, according to evidence at trial. 'I'm ready to go so the city can move on,' Kilpatrick told the judge. 'The people here are suffering, they're hurting. A great deal of that hurt I accept responsibility for.' Kwame Kilpatrick is sketched in court between his attorneys Harold Gurewitz, left, and Margaret Raben before federal Judge Nancy Edmunds during his sentencing today . Kwame Kilpatrick, stands before federal Judge Nancy Edmunds during his sentencing in federal court today in Detroit (court sketch) In March, Kilpatrick, 43, was convicted of racketeering conspiracy, fraud, extortion and tax crimes. The government called it the 'Kilpatrick enterprise', a years-long scheme to shake down contractors and reward allies. He . was doomed by his own text messages, which revealed efforts to fix . deals for a pal, Bobby Ferguson, an excavator who got millions of . dollars in city work through the water department. Contractors . said they were forced to take on Ferguson as a partner or risk losing . lucrative deals. The government alleged that he in turn shared cash with . Kilpatrick. Agents who pored over bank accounts and credit cards said Kilpatrick spent $840,000 beyond his salary during his time as mayor. Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick leaves the U.S. District Court on March 11, 2013, after he was convicted on federal racketeering and other charges in Detroit, Michigan . Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was sentenced to 28 years in prison on two dozen charges including extortion (pictured in court in 2008) Defense attorneys tried to portray the money as generous gifts from political supporters who opened their wallets for birthdays or holidays. The government said Kilpatrick also tapped a nonprofit fund, which was created to help distressed Detroit residents, to pay for yoga, camps for his kids, golf clubs and travel. 'A man with the charisma and ability of Mr. Kilpatrick chose to use his talents on personal aggrandizement and enrichment when he had the potential to do so much for the city,' Judge Nancy Edmunds said before imposing the sentence. Kilpatrick had lied during a trial to cover up an affair with his top aide, Christine Beatty (pictured in court in 2008) The sentence was a victory for prosecutors, who had recommended Kilpatrick serve at least 28 years in prison, while defense attorneys argued for no more than 15 years. Outside court, U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said Kilpatrick seemed to show some remorse but not enough. 'At the end of the day, he did not accept responsibility for stealing from the people of Detroit,' McQuade said. Kilpatrick didn't specifically address his crimes during the hearing, though he said he respected the jury's verdict. An appeal is certain. 'I want the city to heal. I want it to prosper. I want the city to be great again,' he told the judge. 'I want the city to have the same feeling it had in 2006, when the Super Bowl was here.' Kilpatrick, a Democrat, quit office in 2008 in a different scandal that was extraordinary at the time but seems smaller compared with the sweeping federal probe that has led to the convictions of more than 30 people. Sexually explicit text messages revealed that Kilpatrick had lied during a trial to cover up an affair with his top aide, Christine Beatty, and to hide the reasons for demoting or firing police officers who suspected wrongdoing at city hall. Detroit voters soon will elect a third mayor since Kilpatrick's departure, although the city is under the control of an emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, for at least another year. Orr, with the blessing of Michigan's governor, took Detroit into bankruptcy in July, saying there was no other way to solve $18 billion in long-term debt. The case is pending. 'Kilpatrick is not the main culprit of the city's historic bankruptcy, which is the result of larger social and economic forces at work for decades. But his corrupt administration exacerbated the crisis,' prosecutors said in a court filing last week.","Kwame served as mayor of Detroit from 2002 to 2008 .

A town in Michigan has been targeted by a cruel animal abuser who has apparently dumped more than a dozen starving dogs near a pet store. The small dogs, which all seem to be maltese-poodle crossbreeds, were highly emaciated and filthy when they were found and taken into care. Police are now hunting for the culprit, who could face a jail sentence if he is found to have abused the pets. Abandoned: More than a dozen dogs have been dumped near a pet store in Troy, Michigan . Helpless: It is not known why the animals were left to fend for themselves on the street . Cruel: The animals were in an appalling state before they were cleaned up by animal welfare workers . Care: The dogs are being nursed back to health so they can be adopted and find a loving new home . The dogs started being left near a branch of PetSmart in Troy, Michigan in April this year, according to the Detroit Free Press. Most were dumped behind the building and later found by store employees, although some were discovered in other locations nearby. After tracking down the dogs - which sometimes required chasing after them for up to an hour - workers turned them over to the Animal Welfare Society of Southeastern Michigan. This week, the problem got even worse as six emaciated animals were found in the area in a single day. Filth: The animals were found with matted fur and covered in faeces having clearly been neglected . Nurture: The dogs were showered and thoroughly cleaned once the pet store turned them over to the Animal Welfare Society of Southeastern Michigan . Filth: The neglected dogs, apparently all maltese/poodle crossbreeds, were caked in mud . Cheery: The dogs seemed to react well to being washed and finally receiving some nurturing . PetSmart workers are baffled about the culprit's motives - pointing out that the store does not even sell dogs. 'If they'd just call us, we can refer them to a rescue group or the Humane Society,' manager Nikki Taylor told the Free Press. 'We just don't want this continuing.' The animals, which are aged between two and six years old, appear scarred by their experiences and are nervous of people. Debris: This bowl contains two pounds of matted fur and faeces cut from a single dog . Suffering: Some of the animals are clearly traumatised and find it hard to interact normally . Hungry: This fluffy pet welcomed the chance to get fed for the first time in a while . Unwanted: But workers have no idea why someone has been dumping the animals around Troy . One dog was about to give birth when she was abandoned, but thankfully her puppies were delivered safely. A volunteer at the Animal Welfare Society said that the dogs were 'in terrible condition', with matted fur, covered in faeces and dangerously thin. The animals will be put up for adoption once they have been nursed back to full health. Danger: The animals looked as if they had never had their claws trimmed by their owners . Punishment: If the serial abuser is found, he or she could face a hefty prison sentence . Pals: These three poodles were found together and then handed over to a foster home . Epidemic: This is one of six dogs found abandoned near the pet store in a single day this week . Authorities are looking for the person who dumped the dogs - although it is possible that a number of different people could be responsible. 'I think it's a breeding situation,' Ashley LaPorte of the Animal Welfare Society told the Free Press. 'I guess they have too many and they’re overwhelmed. Or it could also be a hoarding situation. 'But whatever's going on, it's pretty heartless that they're dropping them off by the freeway.' Relief: But rescuers fear that some animals may not have been so lucky . Cosy: The Welfare Society has given the dogs shelter after receiving them from the pet store, which does not sell dogs . Heartless: The person who dropped them off could be an overwhelmed dog breeder .","Dogs left near PetSmart store in Troy, Michigan from April up to this week .

On show: Sally Bercow's tattoo was revealed to the nation on ITV last night, and it is a tribute to her three young children . Permanent: It is in the shape of a heart formed by the names of Oliver, nine, Freddie, eight, and Jemima, five . Stage fright: Five-year-old Jemima, pictured with host Stephen Mulhern and her mother, was taken off the stage three times during the hit show . The 43-year-old is rarely out of the spotlight and revealed earlier this year that she has her first tattoo, but refused to say where it was. She was photographed outside a Chester parlour with Celebrity Big Brother friend Paddy Doherty, and both had one done at the same time. Mrs Bercow has left Twitter after she libelled Tory peer Lord McAlpine, after she sent a tweet to her 56,000 followers falsely implying he was a paedophile. But at the time of her new tattoo she wrote: 'Been dithering for years. Really pleased with this one, though - will never regret having tatt of my kids. 'Friends warned me but compared to childbirth (with gas & air!), it was a doddle!' Watch online with ITVPlayer .

ITV said Jemima was the only child out of 20 in the series to break down and find the whole experience too much. A spokesman said the young girl appeared to get ‘stage fright’ after seeing all the people in the audience. ITV said Jemima had been fine at a pre-recording at her family home but when on stage she broke down. After she first broke down Mr Mulhern asked: ‘Has mummy tried to get out of you what you told us?’ As Jemima paused, Mrs Bercow, 43 – married to Commons Speaker John Bercow – prompted her to say no but the youngster replied: ‘Yes you have’. The girl then started crying and was taken to one side before returning back on stage. Family: The Bercows with Jemima at a Remembrance Sunday service at Westminster Abbey .

According to Survival International's figures, the Guarani tribe has a suicide rate at least 34 times . the national average due to the loss of their ancestral lands and . constant attacks by gunmen. Figures reveal that, on average, at least one Guarani has committed suicide every week since the start of this century. Dispute: A Guarani Indian family ride a horse-drawn cart in southern Brazil in 2004. The Indians claim the disputed land has been the graveyard of their ancestors for centuries . The Guarani community, whose total population in Brazil is estimated at 46,000, have been trying to recover a small portion of their original territories, but face violent resistance from wealthy ranchers as well as soya and sugar cane plantation owners. They are Indians are forced to live in . dangerous and squalid conditions on road-sides or in overcrowded . reserves and face malnutrition, poor health and alcoholism. According to Brazil’s Health Ministry, 56 Guarani Indians committed suicide in 2012, although the actual figures are believed to have been higher but may not have been reported. Almost all are hangings, with ropes, belts or cloth, reports the Guardian. The latest victim, on Wednesday, whose name has yet to be released, was a 17-year-old girl. The youngest recorded victim was just nine, although the majority of the victims are between 15 and 29-years-old. Increase: Suicides amongst the Guarani between 1981 and 2008 . Rosalino . Ortiz, a Guarani man, told the not-for-profit organisation: ‘The . Guarani are committing suicide because we have no land.  We don’t have . space any more. In the old days, we were free; now we are no longer . free. 'So our young people . look around them and think there is nothing left and wonder how they can . live. They sit down and think, they forget, they lose themselves and . then commit suicide.’ Thousands of Guarani are now crammed together in camps - one camp in Dourados now has a murder rate that is more than 50 percent higher than that of Iraq, reports the Guardian. Brazil's indigenous activists last week protested outside Congress in Brasilia against a constitutional reform that would transfer from the executive branch to legislators authority to approve and demarcate native lands and environmental conservation parks. Horrifying: Figures reveal that, on average, at least one Guarani has committed suicide every week since the start of this century . Battle: The Guarani community, whose total population in Brazil is estimated at 46,000, have been trying to recover a small portion of their original territories . The Justice Ministry subsequently forwarded a legal finding to the House of Deputies, slamming the amendment. 'We . believe this measure is not only ill-timed and inappropriate, but also . unconstitutional,' said Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo. 'The demarcation of Guarani land should have been completed many years ago, but the process has stalled,' Survival said. It urged the Brazilian government 'to demarcate Guarani lands as a matter of urgency' and pressed US agribusiness giant Bunge and other such firms 'to stop buying sugar cane from Guarani land.' Roughly 12 percent of Brazil's land currently is recognized as indigenous territory. Native Indians grouped in 305 tribes represent less than 0.5 percent of the more than 200 million Brazilians. World Mental Health Day, a United Nations-backed initiative, is held on October 10 each year to raise awareness about mental health issues worldwide. Determined: An Indian from the Guarani tribe marches along Paulista Avenue on the second day of the National Indigenous Mobilization in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week . Survival International is calling on the Brazilian government to demarcate Guarani lands as a matter of urgency and is urging companies such as the US’s Bunge to stop buying sugar cane from Guarani land. Survival’s Director Stephen Corry said today, ‘This is a stark and heart-breaking reminder of the devastation that land theft wreaks on tribal peoples. Sadly, the Guarani are not a unique case – indigenous peoples worldwide often suffer far higher rates of suicide than the majority population. So-called ‘progress’ often destroys tribal peoples but in this case the solution is clear: demarcate the Guarani’s land, before more innocent lives are lost.’ In 2012 the entire tribe vowed to commit mass suicide after a court in Brazil ruled they must leave what they believe is sacred land.","Guarani tribe faces a suicide rate at least 34 times the national average .

A 55-year-old Baltimore grandfather has been charged with involuntary manslaughter after he accidentally left his 16-month-old granddaughter to die in his hot truck three months ago. Sabriya Towles was discovered in her Anthony Jerome Towles' vehicle in Lansdowne in mid-July but her death was initially ruled an accident and the result of hyperthermia, the medical term for excessively high body temperatures. But on October 5, more than three months later, authorities arrested Towles, who they say forgot to drop the infant at child care, instead leaving her in the car at their shared home while he went to have a nap. Tragic: Sabriya Towles, pictured, was discovered dead in her grandfather's truck on July 5 but her death was initially ruled an accident . Mark Cheshire, a spokesman for Baltimore State's Attorney Gregg L. Bernstein, declined to comment on the case but he told the Baltimore Sun that 'based on the evaluation of the evidence, this is the appropriate charge.' Towles slept for four hours after returning home on July 5. As time passed, the temperature rose to a blistering 88 degrees and even hotter inside the truck. When he woke, he went to pick up his granddaughter at daycare. Young life: Towles said he forgot to drop the infant, pictured, at child care, instead leaving her in the car at their shared home while he went to have a nap . 'He had been told that the child was never dropped off in the morning. When he ran back out to his vehicle, he discovered that the child was unresponsive in the back seat,' Cathy Batton, of Baltimore County Police, told CBS Baltimore. Police and fire units were called to the 4100 block of McDowell Lane just before 1 p.m. The child was pronounced dead at St. Agnes Hospital. Death: The grandfather parked the car at the family's home on South Paca Street, pictured, and slept for four hours before driving to pick up the little girl at daycare. It was only then he realized she had been in the vehicle all along . Donna Schindele of Brooklyn, Maryland, said her daughter, who is friends with Sabriya's mother, often baby-sat the little girl. 'It's a tragedy, and him being charged won't bring her back. But I don't understand how you can only drive two miles and forget you had a child in your vehicle,' Schindele told the Baltimore Sun. Towles was released on $25,000 bond. He could receive a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison if convicted. After her death, the distraught family set up a website to raise funds for the hospital fees and her funeral.","Baltimore infant Sabriya Towles' July death was initially ruled an accident .

"By . Jason Groves . PUBLISHED: . 16:33 EST, 10 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:34 EST, 10 October 2013 . The driving age could be raised to 18 in an attempt to slash the death toll on our roads. And young people could be forced to wait until they are 19 before they qualify for a full licence under radical plans being considered by ministers. Currently they can be driving independently at 17. The plans could also see all motorists aged under 30 banned from giving their friends a lift or driving at night for 12 months after they pass their test. The proposals, prepared for the Department for Transport, would also see new motorists face a lower drink-drive limit for a year, regardless of their age. Overhaul: Young people could be forced to wait until they are 19 before they qualify for a full licence under radical plans being considered by ministers . Road safety campaigners have long called for reforms to tackle the carnage caused by young motorists. Yesterday’s report by the respected Transport Research Laboratory calls for the introduction of so-called Graduated Driver Licensing. A driver would have to pass a series of landmarks after their formal test before they were considered to be competent to drive without restrictions. The report suggests the system, already used in countries such as Canada and in parts of the United States, could cut the number killed and injured on Britain’s roads by more than 4,470 a year. The study found that almost a quarter of the road accidents resulting in death or serious injury last year involved a driver under 24. That age group is roughly four times more likely to be involved in a serious accident than older motorists. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is said to be ¿open-minded¿ about the proposals . The report says: ‘The younger a driver is when they become licensed, the more likely they are to become involved in a collision. Meanwhile, the post-licence driving period, when on-road experience is lacking, is the riskiest time.’ The proposals will now be considered by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, and could be included in a formal consultation to be published before Christmas. A source close to Mr McLoughlin last night said he was ‘open-minded’ about the issue. The source said the clear road safety benefits had to be balanced against issues of liberty and practical considerations about the difficulties faced by young people trying to get to work or college, particularly in rural areas. Under the proposals young people would still be allowed to learn to drive when they turn 17. But they would have to turn 18 before they could take their test, and would also have to log 120 hours of supervised practice, including 20 hours at night. After passing their test the novice motorist would then remain ‘on probation’ for 12 months and be required to carry a green ‘P’ plate on their car. During this time they would be banned from carrying passengers aged under 30 or from driving between the hours of 10pm and 5am unless they are accompanied by an adult aged over 30. All new drivers, including older motorists, would also face restrictions on night driving, a lower drink-drive limit and a ban on using a hands-free mobile phone for 12 months after passing their test. Dr Shaun Helman, one of the report’s authors, said: ‘The reasoning behind this is that the evidence shows that both youth  and inexperience are factors in determining crash risk.’ The study found that almost a quarter of the road accidents resulting in death or serious injury last year involved a driver under 24 . Dr Hellman said there was ‘compelling’  evidence that similar restrictions had cut road deaths in countries around the world, including the United States, Australia  and New Zealand. France has a minimum driving age of 18, and new drivers are banned from travelling at more than 90 kilometres per hour (62mph) for two years after passing their test. According to the road safety group Brake, a night driving curfew cut serious accidents involving young drivers by 59 per cent when it was introduced in Washington state. The TRL report says moving to a ‘graduated’ system of driving licences ‘would bring considerable casualty savings for young and novice drivers, their passengers and all other road users’. The Association of British Insurers also called for curbs on young drivers last year, including a minimum period of one year’s practice before taking a test. The organisation, which represents  insurance firms, said the move would help bring down the sky-high premiums faced by young drivers. It said: ‘A car is potentially a lethal weapon, and we must do more to help young drivers better deal with the dangers of driving. Improving the safety of young drivers will also mean that they will face lower motor insurance costs. We have all side-stepped this issue for too long.’ The ABI argued that an 18-year-old  driver is three times more likely to be involved in a crash than a 48-year-old driver. Its research showed 27 per cent of motor personal injury insurance claims over £500,000 resulted from crashes involving drivers aged between 17-24. However, Edmund King, AA president, said: ‘At the extreme end, this report could be seen as just recommending taking novice drivers off the road by regulation and restriction rather than helping them develop the right attitudes and skills to provide them with the mobility they need. ‘Rather than compensating the proposed significant new restrictions through earlier access to the roads under supervision, the authors propose delaying and extending the driving development process to the point where even some 30-years-olds will be restricted in whom they can carry as passengers.’ A spokesman for the Department for  Transport said the research would inform  an upcoming consultative Green Paper on new drivers. The spokesman added: ‘Young drivers drive around five per cent of all the miles driven in Britain, but are involved in about 20 per cent of the crashes where someone is killed or seriously injured. ‘We are committed to improving safety for young drivers and reducing their insurance costs - that is why we are publishing a Green Paper later in the year setting out our proposals. This will include a discussion about how people learn to drive.’","Proposals could cut Britain's road deaths and injuries by 4,470 .

The winless Giants aren't the only New Yorkers having a tough fall. A report out Wednesday by a national tax watch group put New York in the cellar among states when comparing the complexity of tax codes and tax rates. The national Tax Foundation ranked New York at 50th. New York's individual income tax ranking was 49th, ahead of only California, the group said. The Empire State ranked last in corporate taxes. Five of the top 10 worst states were in the northeast. Taxation nation: The 2014 State Business Tax Climate Index ranked New York and New Jersey last and second-to-last . Though New York ranked last, the Tax Foundation said it was no worse than neighbor New Jersey. Both states had plenty of company in the northeast. ‘Though New Jersey has a better overall rank than New York, the states are in a virtual tie for last place this year,’ the report said. ‘New York has a more favorable corporate tax ranking than New Jersey, but its individual income tax suffers from such high rates and narrow bases that New Jersey beats New York ever so slightly,’ the report continued. Other northeast states ranking in the bottom 10 include Rhode Island (46th), Vermont (45th) and Connecticut (42nd). The business group Unshackle Upstate says the ranking is further evidence that bold, broad-based tax relief is needed for families and businesses. ""We must take bold steps to improve our job-killing tax climate,"" said Brian Sampson of Unshackle Upstate. ""A stronger economy starts with lower taxes and the Tax Foundation's report shows that we've got work to do."" Agree to disagree: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (left) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (right) both feel their state offers economic advantages over their neighbor . Gov. Andrew Cuomo has established two tax commissions that will recommend ways to simplify the tax law and cut taxes. Cuomo and the Legislature have extended an income tax surcharge on top earners and a business tax that together have generated more than $2 billion in additional tax revenue annually since 2010. That election year Cuomo and legislators promised no new taxes. New York wouldn’t need to do much to dig itself out of last place, the foundation said. ‘If even slight improvements were made to New York’s tax system, New York has the opportunity to beat New Jersey,’ said the report, whose findings hae ben disputed by New York officials. Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi said the Tax Foundation's conclusions conflict with other performance measures.He said the state unemployment is 6.9 percent, which is under the national rate of 7.3 percent, and Forbes magazine recently ranked New York 21st among states in comparing business climates. ""Over the last three years, New York State has added more than 300,000 private sector jobs, received a positive outlook from Standard & Poor's and Moody's (credit rating services), reduced barriers and lowered taxes for businesses and put the state on secure fiscal footing,"" Azzopardi said. Those looking for tax shelters close to home might want to move to Wyoming, South Dakota or Nevada, the three states with the best tax climates, according to the report. For New Yorkers, like their sports teams, there’s always next year.","New York ranked dead last overall, but is in a virtual tie with New Jersey .

Troubling: The council heavily criticised for failing to protect 'Baby P' - Peter Connelly - has been found wanting in another child abuse case . A toddler was sent home to be beaten horrifically by his abusive parents after a series of blunders by social workers from the same council which failed Baby P. The child was twice taken to hospital with more than 50 injuries after being beaten with a belt, a stick and a cable – but both times staff at Haringey Council allowed him to be sent back to be tortured again. The case, which emerged in a scathing report yesterday, is the latest in a series of failings by the scandal-hit council. While the child’s life was saved, his neglect chillingly echoes the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly, whose mother Tracey was this week cleared for release after serving just four years behind bars. In the more recent case, the boy, Child T, was taken to hospital at least three times over eight months. On one occasion he had more than 50 bruises after being repeatedly beaten up by his Polish parents. A review found multiple failings by doctors, police and social workers for not intervening sooner and failing to learn from what happened to Baby P. ‘Peter Connelly died three years before the first detected injuries to Child T. It is worrying to find compelling evidence of individual and systemic failures within and between services so soon after that high-profile case,’ the report, by the Haringey Local Safeguarding Children Board, said. ‘One might expect, if anything, that agencies would be over sensitive to the possibility of abuse going undetected.’ Chairman Graham Badman added: ‘What is clear is because of failings in the system this child suffered physical abuse that could have been prevented.’ Child T’s injuries were first seen at North Middlesex Hospital in June 2010. He had bruising around his eyes, forehead and nose as well as injuries to his chest and hip area. His Polish stepfather, a heroin user identified as Mr C, claimed the boy often ran around the house and ‘bangs and hits himself on the wall’. Under the microscope: Staff at Haringey Council persistently returned a battered child - Child T - to his parents despite him having terrible injuries . Track record: Victoria Climbie was failed by north London's Haringey Council in a case that shocked Britain and led to protests . After an assessment, the consultant paediatrician wrongly faxed a report to Enfield Council. It said when police later visited the home, officers had ‘no concerns’ about the child’s welfare or ‘home conditions’ with the mother and step-father, who are originally from Poland. At follow-up meetings, no decisions were taken by social workers and police child abuse experts. At one point, Mr C took his child to his GP under the premise he was concerned his child ‘bruised easily’. While a health worker noted he has ‘quite uncommon injuries’ for a child of his age, no one followed up the concerns . Three months later, during an appointment with a GP and a later one with a nurse at the surgery, he was found to have additional bruising to his back, arms and legs. In February 2011, police were called to the family home and officers noticed Child T was extensively bruised. The next day he was taken by police to hospital where he was found to have more than 50 bruises of varying ages and sizes. Indefinite sentences: Tracey Connelly, right, allowed her boyfriend Steven Barker, left, and his paedophile brother Jason Owen to torture to death baby Peter Connelly . He told the doctor he had been hit with a . belt and a stick by Mr C. Later that month, in an interview with a . social worker, he said he had told his mother about being hit. He also . said ‘daddy’ had hit him with a belt and cable. Child T’s stepfather was sentenced to four years in prison in October 2011 for wilfully assaulting a young person under the age of 16 and will be deported. The boy’s mother, referred to as Ms B, is understood to have returned to Poland. The boy, who is now six, was removed from the family home with his three siblings in 2011 – more than a year after the first abuse was noted. Disgusted: Local MP Lynn Featherstone said: 'It is just appalling Haringey Council have become embroiled in another child abuse scandal' They are now in care. The report found weaknesses across all the agencies involved in the child’s case. It stated there was a ‘reluctance to “think the unthinkable” and recognise all the adults in the family as perpetrators of abuse’. The case comes 13 years after the death of eight-year-old Victoria Climbie, who Haringey also failed to protect when she was tortured and murdered by her great-aunt and her boyfriend. Local MP Lynne Featherstone said: ‘After these two horrendous failures, serious changes should have been made. ‘Indeed, the review identifies features that are common between the Baby P and the Child T cases. ‘What makes me even more upset and angry, is Haringey’s Labour leadership have repeatedly told us lessons had been learnt, and Children’s Services had turned a corner. But this was evidently not true – now another child has paid the price.’ Council leader Claire Kober said: ‘We fully accept the findings and apologise unreservedly for the failings set out in the report. ‘Together with partner agencies, we could and should have intervened more swiftly. This case occurred during a period of rebuilding in our children’s service. ‘We have been working hard over the past three years to make significant improvements, which have been recognised by Ofsted.’ Mixed messages: Haringey social services have been forced to apologise again over an abuse case but maintains it is improving and changing .","Unnamed boy was taken to hospital twice but still sent home for more abuse .

Inspirational: Ray Widstrand, pictured, was beaten within an inch of his life but he has forgiven the five teens responsible for the shocking, unprovoked attack . A Minneapolis man who was beaten within an inch of his life has forgiven the five teens responsible for the shocking, unprovoked attack. Ray Widstrand doesn't remember the fateful night of August 4, however authorities say the then-26-year-old found himself in the middle of a terrifying gang confrontation on the streets near his St Paul apartment and was kicked, stomped on and left to die. But Widstrand doesn't believe the beating is a reflection of the community and said he wished the teens the best. 'That was just a freak accident,' Widstrand, who is now 27, told the Star Tribune. 'It was just young kids lashing out. I was a young kid once. I lashed out.' He added: 'I'm indifferent towards them. I wish them the best. But I am recovering and I'll be back soon enough, hopefully I can go back to work, back to my normal life, back to living on my own and back to business as usual.' Five people, one adult and four juveniles, have been charged in the assault on Widstrand. The jury trial for Issac Maiden, 19, who faces first-degree assault and aggravated robbery charges as well as two counts of gang-related crimes, will start Monday. The four juveniles face similar charges. The inspirational cable programming assistant said he'd learned a lot from the harrowing experience, which left him in a wheelchair and unable to perform basic tasks like shaving or using the bathroom alone. Harrowing experience: The 27-year-old, pictured this week, said he'd learned a lot from the harrowing experience, which left him in a wheelchair and unable to perform everyday tasks. He also wears a helmet . 'My dad was right. He said there are more builders than there are tearers down. ...The world is a good place if you just give it a chance,” Widstrand told the Tribune from his room at the rehab center. He thanks his friends, family and the community for their support. 'I have people praying for me. I have to go the extra mile,' he said. The young man is due to undergo more surgery in November, this time to have the blone flaps on his head put back into place. He's hoping to be home by Christmas. Earlier this month, soon after he began constructing sentences again following his severe brain injuries, Widstrand gave his first interview from his wheelchair at a fundraiser held in Minneapolis to help pay for his treatments. Suspect: Five people, one adult and four juveniles, have been charged in the assault. The trial for Issac Maiden, 19, pictured, will start Monday . Speaking slowly and haltingly, Widstrand told a local news station that he has no recollection of the night heartless youths robbed and beat him to the brink of death. The 27-year-old was walking home in . his neighborhood on St Paul's East Side when he was attacked by a group of 30 to 50 juveniles and young adults. He was hit in the head with a 'can in a . sock', stomped on, had his pants ripped off him and was robbed. He was . placed in a medically-induced coma when he was taken to hospital. Wearing . a helmet to protect his head, Widstrand spoke about the difficulties he . has faced in the two months since the beating occurred. 'It's been trying at times,' he said. 'But it's also been a learning experience for me,' Widstrand told KSTP. 'I quit smoking since I've been in the hospital. I eat less junk food. I'm healthier, so that has been nice.' Widstrand has already undergone two surgeries for brain swelling and skull fractures and will face a third in November. He has been undergoing intensive rehabilitation at Courage Kenny Rehab . Institute where he's slowly re-learning basic skills like walking and . speaking. Widstrand told KSTP that he faces months of physical, occupational and speech therapy as he recovers from his serious brain injury.

'Seeing all the support - I just had a birthday last month, and it . has been so cool, getting all the cards,' said Widstrand, who turned 27 . on August 31. He will remain in hospital in the coming months, with a tentative release date of December 1.

'Moving on to the next thing.' Widstrand said he has no recollection of the night his life changed forever. 'I didn't even know I got beaten up till the next day,' he said. 'It was longer than the next day,' said his father. 'To me it seemed like the next day,' Widstrand said. He suffered 'potentially fatal . brain swelling' and 'permanent and protracted loss of brain function' as a result of the beating. Peter Widstrand told The Pioneer Press: 'It seems every day we see some steps . forward. Every day, I see something, . whether it's in his eyes or something he does. '[But] we're still in the place where we don't know if he'll return to work or . return home. We might not know for years. Progress can stop tomorrow. It might not stop two years from now.' The young man had moved to an apartment in the Minnesota city two . months before the attack and was working for a local community channel. Crime scene: Mr Widstrand was walking through his local neighbourhood on St Paul's East Side when he was brutally assaulted, robbed and stripped . Brutal beating: After Mr Widstrand was knocked over one person was seen stomping on his head after which a third stripped him of his trousers to search his pockets . Speaking at a press conference in August, Peter Widstrand said his son had never ‘expressed any concerns' about living on the East Side. 'I . can't imagine why someone would do this to another person. Hopefully . they will at least answer to that,' Peter Widstrand added.

Public sector workers are still earning up to £3,200 a year more than their private sector equivalents. Even after a three-year squeeze on the millions employed by the state, they continue to enjoy an average ‘pay premium’ of more than six per cent, a report reveals today. In some parts of the North East, Merseyside and the South West, public sector workers are paid as much as 14 per cent more – or £3,200 a year on average. Discrepancies: In some parts of Britain public sector workers are still earning up to £3,200 a year more than their private sector equivalents . However, in central London, the East and South East, the average public sector worker is paid less than they would if they were working in the private sector. The scale of the regional variations, uncovered by centre-Right think-tank Policy Exchange, will lead to renewed calls to end national pay bargaining for the public sector and have regional scales instead. Chancellor George Osborne has warned that public sector pay levels are so out of kilter in some regions that they are squeezing out the private sector, and suggested that they should be made ‘more responsive’ to local labour markets. However, the Liberal Democrats boasted at their annual conference last month that they had blocked Conservative attempts to bring in regional variations. Today’s report finds that more than 12 per cent of national income – £180 billion – is spent on public sector pay. On average, a public sector worker benefits from a 6.1 per cent pay premium, earning as much as £1,400 a year more than someone in the private sector. Women tend to have larger pay premiums than men. The average premium has been relatively steady since mid-2010, suggesting that the Coalition’s freeze on public sector pay is starting to address the balance. The report recommends abolishing national pay deals in favour of a system that reflects local labour markets and rewards performance. Rebalancing the pay and pensions of public sector workers so that they are in line with the private sector would save £6.3billion a year, the think-tank says. This could be used to create at least 288,000 private sector jobs in some of the poorest parts of the country. Today’s report finds that more than 12 per cent of national income – £180 billion – is spent on public sector pay . Matthew Oakley, head of economics and social policy at Policy Exchange, said: ‘Nationalised pay negotiation is not fit for purpose for the modern public sector. It is bad for the economy and bad for public services. ‘We should move to a system where local public sector employers can decide how to negotiate salaries with employees in order to reflect the realities of their local labour market. ‘At the same time as freeing up money for infrastructure and local growth projects, this will enable top performing public sector workers to be paid more.’ But TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Cutting pay in those parts of the country sharing least in the much delayed and rather shallow recovery makes no economic sense. It will make the north-south divide even greater. ‘And it will make inequality within regions greater too, as the biggest losers from these proposals will be low-paid staff in the public sector. ‘We should be spreading the living wage in both public and private sectors, not listening to these divisive and unfair proposals from well-off London think-tank wonks.’ Dave Prentis, Unison general secretary, said the public sector includes a raft of highly skilled jobs that are not represented in the private sector, such as judges, lecturers, doctors, army generals and senior civil servants. ‘The idea that there is a public sector pay premium is a myth and dressing it up with dodgy statistics still won’t make it true,’ he said. ‘The real pay difference is between those at the top and the bottom – the bankers and financiers who are still raking in the bonuses.’ Mr Osborne has announced that pay restraint in the public sector is to continue at least until the next election. A two-year pay freeze is being followed by a pay rise cap of one per cent for two further years. And the number of predicted public sector job losses under the Government’s austerity measures has risen to 710,000 by 2016/17.","Public sector pay is 14% more in parts of the North East, Merseyside and the South West .

Road to recovery: Matthew Parks, 13, works on core strengthening physical therapy for his Chance spinal fracture at Select Physical Therapy in Slidell, Louisiana . A 13-year-old boy from Louisiana is still in the process of recovering from his injuries nearly two months after he cracked his spine due to an improperly fastened seat belt. In August, Matthew Parks, of Slidell, was on his way to church with his mother and two sisters when the vehicle they were riding in was involved in an accident. Before the family hit the road, the teenager buckled up, but tucked the crossover shoulder strap of his seat belt under his arm. His older sister, Katie, who was behind the wheel, got distracted and briefly lost control of the car, which ended up in a ditch. The impact of the collision sent Matthew’s upper body forward, causing his spine to snap and leaving him on the brink of paralysis, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported. Luckily, the 13-year-old was able to regain his ability to walk and has spent the past two months attending physical therapy sessions to strengthen his core. Besides rehabilitation, the 13-year-old has been busy playing catch-up in school after missing the first three weeks of his first year in junior high school. Matthew Parks’ life changed on August 11, when the Slidell teen, his mother Terri, and sisters Jennifer and Katie piled into the family's 2010 Buick LaCrosse and headed to church. Impact: Matthew snapped his spine in a car crash after tucking the crossover shoulder strap of his seat belt under his arm . Katie Parks was driving that Sunday with Matthew riding on the backseat. Although the boy has been taught by his parents to always wear a seat belt, Terri Parks sometimes would allow her kids to tuck the shoulder strap under their arms for comfort. That is what Matthew did on that Sunday without giving it a second thought - a decision that nearly cost him his ability to walk. When Katie Parks took her eyes off the road for a moment to change the song on her iPod, she lost control of the car and crashed it into a culvert in St Tammany Parish. Because the boy's restraint was not properly secured, the impact of the crash caused his upper half to snap forward while his lower half remained secured by the lap belt. Matthew was rushed to North Shore's Ochser Medical Center, where a CT scan revealed that the teen suffered what is known as a Chance fracture - a break that went through the middle of his back, injuring his liver, spleen, pancreas and kidneys. Major trauma: Chance fracture was first described in 1948 by British radiologist G.Q. Chance as a flexion injury of the spine . Recipe for disaster: Drivers and passengers risk serious injury by tucking the crossover seat belt strap under their arm (right) for comfort because in case of a crash, the impact would propel their unrestrained upper body forward . ‘The doctors compared the fracture in his back to cutting a loaf of bread in half - a clean break,’ Mrs Parks told the newspaper. The traumatic spinal fracture is named after G.Q. Chance, a British radiologist who was the first to describe this type of lumbar injury in 1948. After three days of medical treatments, doctors were able to perform a surgery to mend Matthew's Chance fracture by inserting a rod and four screws in his back to stabilize the spine. Matthew is now able to walk, but has to wear a body brace and attend regular physical therapy sessions to strengthen his back muscles. On the mend: Matthew, pictured here with his father, Ken, has been catching up on missed schoolwork and exercising to straighten his injured back . Although he is allowed to do some physical activities, he still cannot run or perform simple everyday tasks like tie his own shoes. Since the accident, Teri Parks has been on a mission to share her son's story in order to raise awareness of seat belt safety. ‘I truly hope it encourages everyone not to wear their seat belt like that and to keep an eye on their kids when they buckle up, too,’ Parks said.","Matthew Parks, of Louisiana, suffered a Chance fracture when his spine snapped on impact .

Mr Jenkin warned: ‘Every man in the Conservative Party needs to change or be left behind. The leadership needs to be on this 24-7-365, not just at re-shuffle time.’ Writing in the House magazine he adds: ‘Many of us Tory men tend to feel that “women” can deal with “women’s issues”, so men can get on with running the country.’ The Quad of the four most senior ministers are all men – Mr Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne, Deputy PM Nick Clegg and Treasury minister Danny Alexander. The National Security Council is ‘overwhelmingly men’ and the Tory High Command, including Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne and strategist Lynton Crosby are all men. Male-dominated: David Cameron is accused of surrounding himself with men, in government and at the top of the Tory party . Switch: Labour's lead over the Tories among women now stands at 13 points, according to a recent Mumsnet/ Ipsos Mori poll . Mr Jenkin went on: ‘Only three out of 25 on the Party Board are women. Most of the advisers and policy wonks are men. And of course, most MPs will continue to be men. ‘It is going to take a long time to change all this, so what else must we change? We should look at how we all behave.’ Mr Jenkin recalled how at a dinner to discuss prospects and tactics in the marginal seats, host Lord Ashcroft was asked by a woman MP about declining Conservative support amongst women. The peer replied: ‘Shut up and sit down!’ Mr Jenkin went on: ‘He was trying to make a joke, of course, but the need to make a joke speaks volumes about the anxiety provoked by the question.’ Janet Daley, a journalist at the Daily Telegraph, has claimed she and a female colleague were ignored at a briefing by an advisor to the Chancellor ‘as if we were pieces of furniture rather than sentient beings’. Mr Jenkin wrote: ‘And the Prime Minister greeted a leading high profile business women who happens to be the wife of a major donor to the party, by asking, “And where is [x – the husband]!?” ‘We men are all guilty of such unconscious slights to women, but women voters see it and feel it. ‘A business change programme would involve zero tolerance of such behaviour. We have perhaps yet to understand what “change” in the Conservative Party really means. ‘It is not something the leadership does, or women can do for us.’ The Conservatives have repeatedly launched attempts to woo the female vote, hiring advisers dedicated to developing policies which appeal to women. But the increase in Labour’s popularity since 2010 has been fuelled by women abandoning Mr Cameron in favour of Ed Miliband. Three years ago 36 per cent of women backed the Tories, compared to 31 per cent for Labour. But a new Ipsos Mori survey for Mumsnet shows only 29 per cent now support the Conservatives, with Labour up to 42 per cent. The gap is three times large than among male voters. Labour has a 25 point lead among women aged 18-34 and 21 points among 35-54 year olds. Adding to the Tory woes, Labour is even ahead among the most affluent women who might be expected to back the Tories.","Bernard Jenkin said even David Cameron is guilty of 'unconscious slights'

Just weeks before Downton Abbey's controversial rape scene, producer Gareth Neame said the show's global popularity was due to its tame nature . The producer of Downton Abbey said the show's tameness was the reason behind its global success - just weeks before it aired a shocking rape scene. More than 200 complaints flooded in to ITV following the controversial scene on Sunday, prompting the show's Oscar-winning writer Julian Fellowes to defend it. ITV warned viewers about upsetting scenes before the start of the period drama but still received 'around 60 complaints' by Monday, with Ofcom also receiving an undisclosed number. Just weeks earlier producer Global Globe-winning producer Gareth Neame said the show's global popularity was due to its tame nature. According to the Daily Mirror he told a U.S. interviewer: 'Nobody [else] is doing it anywhere. 'No executives think that anyone wants it. The idea of the non-sexual love affair was so out of fashion it was on another planet.' Viewers complained following the episode, aired on Sunday night, in which Joanna Froggatt's character, Anna Bates, was attacked by Mr Green, played by EastEnders actor Nigel Harman. Mr Fellowes has defended the scene, saying the director had shown restraint in cutting away to other rooms of the house and it could have been much more graphic. He told the BBC: 'The whole point of the way we do things on Downton is we don't do them gratuitously. We are interested in exploring the resultant emotions and the effect these things have on people. 'If we'd have wanted a sensational rape we could have stayed down in the kitchen with the camera during the whole thing and wrung it out. Scroll down for video .

'The point of our handling is not that we're interested in sensationalising but we're interested in exploring the mental damage and the emotional damage.' Joanne Froggatt has also defended the storyline, saying she is 'proud' of Downton Abbey for tackling the controversial subject. The star said it was a 'brave' move by programme-makers to feature such a difficult scene in the normally genteel Sunday night series. Froggatt, who was made aware of the storyline by Mr Neame a week before she was given the script, said creators of the show did not want to show graphic violence on screen. Nigel Harman, who plays Mr Green in the show, also defended the storyline. He said on This Morning on Monday: 'For a show like Downton Abbey it really leaps out as a bold and risky idea.'

Margaret Thatcher's flagship Right to Buy scheme has been given a boost with the number of people buying their council houses doubling in a year. Ten thousand tenants have purchased their properties since last year, the highest level since before the recession, after the government increased the discounts available. Buyers are now able to get a discount of £75,000 - treble what they were getting in most parts of the country - and £100,000 off the price in London from this year, four times the previous rate. Ten thousand tenants have purchased their properties since last year, the highest level since before the recession, after the government increased the discounts available . Prime Minister David Cameron (left) with first time buyers Kayleigh Groom (right) and her partner Chris Day this week . David Cameron praised the opening up of home ownership to those previously locked out of the property market, and said the money raised would be ploughed into building more affordable homes. New proposals expected to be made law by next year would further relax the rules, allowing tenants to buy their homes after living in them for just three years, rather than the current five. Kris Hopkins, the new housing minister, said: 'For years the right to buy was allowed to wither on the vine, with ever-decreasing discounts leaving the prospect of home ownership out of reach for far too many social tenants. 'But our reinvigorated scheme has changed that, with increased discounts helping more than 10,000 new homeowners on to the property ladder. 'And because we've committed to using the additional money raised towards funding new affordable homes for rent, we're also getting Britain building and will soon have the fastest rate of affordable house-building for two decades.' Since the discounts were increased in April last year 8,398 people took up the offer in the following 12 months. Another 2,149 did so in April to June this year. The sales will generate £173million for local councils to use to build new houses.

Use of flesh-eating krokodil is spreading across the U.S. and doctors say some victims are injecting it because they think it is heroin. The first cases of the drug, which is popular in Russia, were recorded in Arizona last month. But three cases have now been reported in Chicago and doctors say two of the women did not even know they had been sold the drug. Scroll down for video . This Russian man is suffering the side-effects of Krokodil use. Doctors say there are users of the drug in Chicago just weeks after first known cases in U.S. were reported in Arizona . This man's ankle (left) shows symptoms of gangrene and another individual's fingers are rotting away (both cases are from Russia). Doctors fear an epidemic of the cheap heroin substitute in the U.S. The women are all aged between 18 and 25 and come from middle class backgrounds. Doctors . have warned of the horrifying side effects of the homemade drug, which . is said to give a more powerful high than heroin and is much cheaper to . produce. It is created using a mixture of codeine and gasoline or oil. It is then filtered and injected into the user's body. It . is called Krokodil because it leave addicts with reptilian-like skin . and prolonged use causes gangrene and user's flesh begins to rot. Dr . Abhin Singla said he instantly recognized the smell of rotting flesh at . Presence St Joseph Medical Center in Chicago and realized krokodil use . had arrived in the city. Dr . Singla, the hospital's director of addiction services, told Joliet.Patch he surprised at how quickly krokodil use had spread from . Arizona. He said: 'If you want to kill yourself, this is the way to do it.' Rabid use in Russia has caused up to 2.5 million people to register and seek treatment as addicts and the average life span for a user is only two to three years. 'When drug users do it repeatedly, the skin sloughs. It causes hardening of their skin. It will cause necrosis,' explained LoVecchio. The . doctor said two of the patients arrived at hospital asking for help to . wean themselves off heroin, without realizing they had actually been . injecting themselves with krokodil. He . hopes warnings about the drug will spread through word of mouth among . addicts and called for greater education to halt a feared epidemic. Dr . Singla told the website: 'The goriness of the pictures of rotting arms . and legs are hard to look at, but I think parents really need to share . them with their kids.' Dr. Frank LoVecchio at Banner's Poison Control Center says he believes the two cases found in Arizona to be the start of a problem in the United States . Last month, Banner's Poison Control Center in Arizona . encountered the drug when two addicts arrived in emergency rooms with . their flesh hanging off their body, exposing bone or with skin . resembling that of a crocodile, hence its name. 'We've . had two cases this past week that have occurred in Arizona,' said Dr. Frank LoVecchio, the co-medical director at Banner's Poison Control . Center to KPHO.Com. Krokodil's, medical name is desomorphine and is created by mixing codeine with  gasoline, paint thinner, hydrochloric acid, iodine and red phosphorous.There are reportedly nearly three million users in Russia and the epidemic began in Siberia and the Russian Far East.The drug causes flesh to rot from the inside out and the addict's skin becomes scaly, like a crocodile's, hence the name. Blood vessels burst and the surrounding tissue dies. Gangrene and amputations are a common result and sometimes bone can be exposed.The high lasts one hour and a half and the drug is three times cheaper to produce than heroin. 'As . far as I know, these are the first cases in the United States that are . reported. So we're extremely frightened,' he continued. LoVechhio . says that the two cases he has encountered are most likely linked and . he declined to comment on the appearance of the two users. 'Where there is smoke there is fire, and we're afraid there are going to be more and more cases,' said LoVechhio. Some users in Russia develop brain damage and speech impediments in addition to the horrific scars. Krokodil, whose medical name is desomorphine, has the same mental effect as heroin but is produced with over-the-counter codeine and mixed with gasoline, paint thinner, hydrochloric acid and even the red phosphorous scraped from the tips of matches. Prevalent in Siberia and the Russian Far East, the explosion of users began in 2002, but over the past five years in Russia, usage has trebled. In 2011 alone, Russia's Federal Drug Control Service confiscated 65 million doses. The flesh rotting that is specific to Krokodil occurs directly at the injection site which could be anywhere from the feet to the forehead to the more traditional arms.","Three young women treated in hospital for effects of krokodil use .

The Queen has voiced her concern about children being attracted to computer games and e-books rather than reading traditional materials. Although it is highly unusual for the monarch to openly express an opinion on such issues, as a mother, grandmother and now great-grandmother, it is clearly a problem close to her heart. The monarch commented as she presented author Joanne Harris with an MBE for services to literature at Buckingham Palace yesterday. The Queen has voiced her concern about children being attracted to computer games and e-books rather than reading traditional materials. She made the comments as she presented author Joanne Harris (right) with an MBE for services to literature at Buckingham Palace yesterday . Harris, whose books have been published in more than 40 countries, came to prominence when her 1999 novel Chocolat topped the best-seller lists that year. Speaking after today's investiture ceremony, the writer, whose books have been translated in more than 50 languages, said of her chat with the Queen: ‘She asked me what I thought about e-books and computer games and said that she feared that children were playing with those more than they were reading books. ‘So I told her that we start them on e-books and computer games and TV and then try to get them on to books later.’ She added of her MBE: ‘It's wonderful to be recognised and it's wonderful to see the world of literature be recognised every time this happens to one of us.' Computer games and television have long been accused of distracting youngsters from reading. Posed by model . ‘Books may change shape but people will always need stories, and the shape of those stories may alter. 'I think hard copy books are here to stay for a long time. The fact they're branching out into other areas doesn't feel threatening at all.’ Computer games and television have long been accused of distracting youngsters from reading. Research by the National Literacy Trust published earlier this year found that a majority of children preferred to read on screens rather than from books but those who used the new technology had weaker literacy skills. New research published this week also shows tablets have become a ‘must-have accessory’ for the country’s toddlers, with 50 per cent of the UK’s two and three-year-olds using one. A survey, by OnePoll, showed 61 per cent of three-year-olds and 38 per cent of two-year-olds play and learn on iPads. Conducted on behalf of the children’s app range Justin’s World, it questioned 1,000 parents who have children between the ages of two and six. The poll  showed 4 per cent of two-year-olds have their own tablet and this doubles to 8 per cent of three-year-olds. By the time they are four, it more than doubles again - almost one fifth (19 per cent) of four-year-olds own their own tablet. The majority of two-year-olds who use a tablet spend one hour a week on it, rising to one hour a day for three-year-olds. And a third of parents think their toddler is more proficient at using a tablet than them. The Queen’s daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall, is a great advocate of literacy in children and is patron of the charity Booktrust. Its Chief Executive, Viv Bird, said of the Queen’s comments: ‘At Booktrust, we share the Queen’s love of the physical book, and appreciate that this is how many people choose to read, and will continue to do so. ‘We feel that the important point is that children read, rather than how they go about doing so. ‘Digital books are valuable as they offer an opportunity to engage new generations of readers - we have recently published a list of the best 100 books to read before the age of 14, many of which are now available digitally. ‘We feel that children should be given the choice. Let’s give them both of these fantastic options to pick from and get them reading.’","Monarch spoke as she .

It was just a few short years ago when the United States government was forced to bailout the auto industry, and now the tables have turned - the United States government currently has less cash on hand than at least one automaker, as well as eight other Standard & Poor's 500 companies. As politicians in Washington D.C. continue their seemingly endless debate on whether to raise the country's debt ceiling (the amount of debt lawmakers authorize the Treasury to enter into), the U.S. is running out of money to pay the bills it's already incurred. At the moment, the Treasury has only $32 billion in its operating accounts. In contrast, General Electric currently has nearly three times that amount of accessible cash - currently, GE has more than $88 billion in cash-on-hand. Poorhouse: The U.S. government currently has less money than nine S&P 500 companies . According to a graph created by QZ.com, GE tops the list of companies with more moulah than the U.S. government. Also on that list is Microsoft with $77 billion, Google with nearly $55 billion and Cisco with $50 billion. Ford also made the list with $36 billion (Ford is one of the few domestic automakers that did not accept bailout money). General Motors - which received nearly $50 billion in bailout cash from the U.S. government starting in 2008 - now trails the federal government in cash-on-hand by a mere $3 billion (GM currently has $27 billion in its coffers). On Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner announced that  Republicans would vote to extend the government's ability to borrow money for six weeks — but only if President Barack Obama first agrees to fresh negotiations on spending cuts. Under the Republican plan, the partial government shutdown would continue in the meantime. White House spokesman Jay Carney said that Obama 'would likely sign' a clean bill increasing the debt cap but that the president also wants Republicans to reopen the government. He did not rule out Obama agreeing to Boehner's debt ceiling proposal if the government remains closed, but the White House made no promises that Obama would hold negotiations under those circumstances. 'He will not pay ransom in exchange for the Republicans in the House doing their job,' Carney said. Obama is to meet with Boehner and other House GOP leaders at the White House Thursday afternoon. Debt: House Speaker John Boehner said Thursday that the House would consider increasing the debt ceiling . After weeks of decline, financial market indexes shot higher in anticipation of a possible deal that could avert a federal financial default. Both the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 index were up well over 1 percent in afternoon trading . I would hope the president would look at this as an opportunity and a good faith effort on our part to move halfway, halfway to what he's demanded, in order to have these conversations begin,' Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters after presenting the plan to rank-and-file GOP lawmakers. Boehner produced his proposal as the shutdown entered its 10th day. On that front, the administration said it would allow states to use their own money to reopen some national parks that have been closed. Governors in at least four states — Utah, South Dakota, Arizona and Colorado — have asked for authority to reopen national parks within their borders because of the economic impact of the closures. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said the government will consider offers to pay for park operations but will not surrender control of national parks to the states. In the money: Google is one of nine companies that currently has more money than the U.S. government . As for the deeper problem of the federal debt ceiling, the administration has warned that unless the limit is raised, the government will deplete its ability to borrow money by next Thursday, an event officials have warned could trigger a default that could wound the world economy as well as America's . Obama has steadfastly insisted that Congress reopen the government and extend the debt limit without conditions. His acceptance of the GOP proposal could mean a brief resolution to the fight over the debt limit and a continuation of the shutdown while negotiations proceed. Republicans have been demanding cuts in government programs, including Obama's 2010 health care law, and a bigger effort to cut long-term federal deficits as their price for reopening government and extending the debt limit. Obama has repeatedly noted recent improvement in the deficit figures. After four years of trillion-dollar deficits, the 2013 shortfall is expected to register below $700 billion. Some conservatives still expressed reservations with the Boehner plan. 'I'm not very enthusiastic about that,' Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said. Under Boehner's offer, the House would also appoint negotiators to bargain with the Democratic-led Senate over a budget compromise. Those talks have been on hold for months, and the two chambers have deep differences over taxes and cuts in benefit programs. Ballin': With $77 billion in cash-on-hand, Microsoft has more than double the amount of money as the U.S. government . Earlier Thursday, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew warned the Senate Finance Committee that failure to renew the government's ability to borrow money 'could be deeply damaging' to financial markets and threaten Americans' jobs and savings. It would also leave the government unsure of when it could make payments ranging from food aid to Medicare reimbursements to doctors, he said. 'The United States should not be put in a position of making such perilous choices for our economy and our citizens,' the secretary said. 'There is no way of knowing the irrevocable damage such an approach would have on our economy and financial markets.' The game of Washington chicken over increasing the debt limit — required so Treasury can borrow more money to pay the government's bills in full and on time — had sent the stock market south, spiked the interest rate for one-month Treasury bills and prompted Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest manager of money market mutual funds, to sell federal debt that comes due around the time the nation could hit its borrowing limit. At the Finance committee hearing, Lew met incredulity from Republicans, who said the bigger problem was the soaring costs of benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare and the long-term budget deficits the country faces. Many expressed doubt about Lew's description of the consequences of default. Bling, bling: General Electric - with nearly $90 billion in the bank - has nearly three times the amount of money as the U.S. government . Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., said, 'I think this is 11th time I've been through this discussion about the sky is falling and the Earth will erupt. Wyoming families aren't buying these arguments.' Replied Lew, 'After they run up their credit card, they don't get to ignore it.' Meanwhile, the Senate gave final congressional approval to a bill ensuring that families of fallen troops be paid death benefits, which have been halted during the shutdown. Word that those payments had stopped prompted lawmakers of both parties to act to restore them. In addition, the House voted 249-175 to finance border security and customs personnel through Dec. 15, the latest of the House GOP's bills aimed at reviving selected programs during the shutdown. The Senate has ignored most of the measures, saying the entire government must be restarted.","General Electric, Google and Microsoft are three of the nine S&P 500 companies that currently have more cash-on-hand than the U.S. government .

The richest MP in Parliament has spoken of a £1million wrecking spree which saw a Jeep smash into three aircraft and demolish buildings on his country estate – just hours after he was sacked as a minister. Two planes were destroyed and a third was rammed into buildings at the airstrip, causing horses to bolt from their paddock and charge along a busy road. Richard Benyon, 53, said: ‘The horses were running up and down the A4 – the vehicle had smashed into the aircraft, pushing one into the buildings, and it then crashed through gates and across fields.’ Former minister: Richard Benyon, pictured with wife Zoe and son Louis has spoken of a £1million wrecking spree on his 20,000 acre estate . Mr Benyon, the Conservative MP for West Berkshire who is worth £200million, said his vast Englefield estate between Newbury and Reading had been ‘plagued for years’ by gangs staging illegal hare coursing events. There had also been numerous thefts and vandalism of crops, but nothing on the scale of Monday night’s damage. Thames Valley Police, who are questioning a 29-year-old man from Slough, Berkshire, say a Jeep was deliberately driven into the planes on the 20,000-acre estate. The man has been bailed until November 18. Peter Ford, 70, of Upper Basildon, near Reading, who owns one of the planes, said: ‘I was gobsmacked, stunned, at the damage. Walled estate: Englefield House, home of former minister Richard Benyon and his family . ‘They left bits of the car embedded in the planes. They were completely trashed with the wings almost detached. ‘Our plane is like a vintage car – we spent a lot of time, love and money to keep it going and there’s only half a dozen in the UK. ‘They’re no longer in production.’ Police estimated the damage to the planes at £750,000. Mr Benyon lives at Englefield House in the heart of the estate with his second wife Zoe, 42, and son Louis. Michael and Carole Middleton, parents of the Duchess of Cambridge, live in a £7million country mansion four miles from Englefield. On Monday, Mr Benyon was fired as an environment minister and will return to the back benches in a government shake-up by David Cameron, who was raised in the village of Peasemore, a few miles from Englefield. Wrecked: One of the Cessna airplanes damaged on Mr Benyon's estate . One of the planes was a classic 1950s vintage Cessna G-AXZO. The others are also thought to be Cessnas. A Jeep Grand Cherokee was discovered on fire on the nearby A4 at Theale. Mr Benyon is regarded as the wealthiest MP in Parliament. The great-great-grandson of three-times Tory Prime Minister Lord Salisbury. He can trace his ancestry back to William Cecil, the chief political adviser to Elizabeth I. He was appointed a minister at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in 2010. He is a former officer with the Royal Green Jackets and is the son of Sir William Benyon, himself a former Tory MP. Englefield House is in a  private walled estate that includes farmland, woodland and a model village. It was built during the reign of Elizabeth I, who granted the manor of Englefield to her ‘spymaster’, Sir Francis Walsingham. The house came into the Benyon family’s possession in the early 19th century. The gardens are open all year but the house is open only to pre-booked group tours. The Benyons also have land and property interests in London and Scotland. Mr Benyon, MP for Newbury since 2005, also owns a £1.5million house near Westminster. Englefield House is often used as a location for TV series and films such as X-Men: First Class, The King’s Speech and Great Expectations. Last night a police spokesman said they were still hunting another person in connection with the attack.","Two planes were destroyed at Richard Benyon's Englefield House estate .

Tim Giardina, was relieved of duty yesterday amid a military investigation of allegations that he used counterfeit chips at an Iowa casino. The move is exceedingly rare and perhaps unprecedented in the history of U.S. Strategic Command, which is responsible for all American nuclear warfighting forces, including nuclear-armed submarines, bombers and land-based missiles. The Navy's top spokesman, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said Giardina, who had held the job since December 2011, is being reassigned to the Navy staff pending the outcome of the probe by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Vice Adm. Tim Giardina, was notified Wednesday that he has been relieved of duty . The gambling matter originated as a local law enforcement investigation in Iowa in June. As a consequence of being removed from his post at Strategic Command, Giardina falls in rank to two-star admiral. He had been suspended by Gen. Robert Kehler, the top commander at Strategic Command, on Sept. 3, although that move was not disclosed publicly until Sept. 28. After his suspension Giardina remained at Strategic Command but was not allowed to perform duties that required use of his security clearance. The decision to take the next step, to relieve him of duty, was made on Oct. 3, one official said. That required approval by President Barack Obama, two defense officials said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the internal decision-making. Kehler had recommended to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel that Giardina be relieved of duty and returned to the Navy, and Hagel agreed, according to Pentagon spokesman Carl Woog. Giardina is alleged to have used $1,500 in counterfeit chips at the Horseshoe Casino in Council Bluffs, Iowa (pictured) Giardina had no comment yesterday, according to a Strategic Command spokeswoman, Navy Capt. Pamela Kunze. A . former commander of Strategic Command, retired Air Force Gen. Eugene . Habiger, said he believes this is the first time in the history of the . command that a deputy commander has been relieved of duty. Strategic . Command was created in 1992 at the end of the Cold War. The aim was to . unify the command of nuclear forces previously run separately by the Air . Force and the Navy. 'I . know of no other case ever of a deputy commander who was relieved for . cause,' Habiger said in a telephone interview. He headed the command . from 1996-98. Giardina is a . career submarine officer. He commanded Submarine Squadron 17 in Bangor, . Wash., which included 10 nuclear-armed Trident submarines from 2001-03.

Ironbridge Gorge, often heralded as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, is under 'extreme' threat from landslides, according to a new report. The Shropshire World Heritage Site, which consists of 18th century iron works, huge kilns and even a Victorian town, is set to undergo a £12million overhaul to save it from further erosion. But ground monitoring in Jackfield near the site, has unearthed 'disturbing' findings of constant land movement towards the river as recently as last winter. Under threat: Ironbridge Gorge in Shropshire is said to face 'extreme' risk of landslides . Stunning: The historical area is home to ten museums and attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year . An action plan was revealed between . Telford and Wrekin and Shropshire councils to stabilise an area covering . 7.6 acres of the historic site. The report reveals for the first time the extent of the work necessary - and the consequences of doing nothing. Some stabilisation work has already taken place in the area but the report’s author, planning officer Valerie Hulme, says more action is 'absolutely necessary'. She warned the river gorge, visited by hundreds of thousands of tourists every year, could be blocked by a landslide, causing flooding. Extensive preventative measures are deemed 'vital' for the long term survival of residents, business and tourism in the area. A total of 350 metres along the river at Salthouse Road, rising 250 metres into Jackfield, will be underpinned and roads and footpaths realigned. World first: The iconic bridge over the River Severn was built by Abraham Darby III in 1779 . A new road, car park and river viewing areas would also be created by the plan, which is recommended to get the go-ahead by planners next week. Ms Hulme warned: 'Extreme events in the Gorge where the land slips into the River Severn are not theoretical, they are real, having happened twice in the past 60 years. 'The ground monitoring undertaken in this area is disturbing, showing constant movement, most recently over the winter.' Significant landslides have been recorded around Salthouse Road since the 1880s. In 1952, six houses were lost, around 300,000 tonnes of ground moved and the river reduced from 38.1m wide to 24.4m and in 1983 Salthouse Road was swept into the river. The latest stabilisation project is expected to take two years. Historic: The area was made a Unesco world heritage site in 1986 - putting it alongside the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, the Great Wall of China and the Pyramids in Egypt in terms of its historical importance . Ironbridge Gorge was described by writer Charles Hulbert in 1837 as 'the most extraordinary district in the world'. The iconic bridge over the River Severn was built by Abraham Darby III in 1779 and was the first of its kind in the world. The location of the bridge was chosen because East Shropshire was an important industrial area because of the huge coal deposits near the surface. It was made a Unesco world heritage site in 1986 - putting it alongside the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, the Great Wall of China and the Pyramids in Egypt in terms of its historical importance. The Gorge and its ten museums spread along the valley by the River Severn attract 500,000 visitors every year bringing £20million to the local economy of Telford and Wrekin and the wider Shropshire area.","The Shropshire site is to undergo a £12million overhaul to preserve it .

There were growing demands last night for an inquiry into whether the Guardian could be prosecuted for publishing top-secret files. The calls came as the row over the leaking of intelligence intensified with Nick Clegg and Theresa May joining the Prime Minister’s attack on the newspaper. It has now been condemned by David Cameron, his deputy and the Home Secretary for revelations described as a ‘gift’ to terrorists by MI5 chief Andrew Parker. Mr Cameron has thrown his full weight behind Mr Parker’s warning on Tuesday that printing documents stolen by fugitive US agent Edward Snowden was handing fanatics the advantage they need to ‘strike at will’. There have been calls for prosecutions in the wake of The Guardian's leaking of espionage secrets. Pictured is Alan Rusbridger, the newspaper's editor . In the House of Commons, Tory MP Julian Smith demanded to know if the Guardian had broken the law by transporting sensitive personal  information about UK agents across the world. The material was allegedly included in 58,000 secret documents being carried by David Miranda, the  partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald. The newspaper was paying for his flights when he was detained at Heathrow airport in August. Despite the wave of anger at the newspaper, however, the main BBC news bulletins were still largely ignoring the furore, leading to accusations of ‘Left-wing bias’ by MPs. Mr Smith told fellow MPs: ‘The Guardian has not denied sending detailed family and personal information about security agents across borders. This is illegal, it’s threatening our agents and their families. ‘Can we have a statement from the Home Secretary to clarify that the law will be upheld whether or not the organisation involved is hiding behind the fig leaf of journalism?’ Andrew Lansley, Leader of the Commons, said he would ask Mrs May to consider the comments. Leading counter-terrorism expert Professor Anthony Glees also declared that the Guardian should be prosecuted. The head of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the  University of Buckingham said that Mr Parker clearly believed the UK’s security had been damaged. ‘If that is the case, a prosecution under the Official Secrets Act should follow,’ added Prof Glees.‘It is not clear to me why that has not happened and I suspect it is not clear to the Director-General [Mr Parker] either.’ Meanwhile, the UK National Defence Association, which includes former top military chiefs, warned that the leaks have put the lives of soldiers at risk. They fear that revealing intelligence techniques could help extremists targeting British troops overseas to avoid detection. General Sir Mike Jackson, former Chief of the General Staff, said he agreed with everything Mr Parker had said about the leaks. ‘We are getting into very dangerous territory here,’ he added. Association director Andy Smith added the newspaper had ‘crossed the line’ between legitimate journalism and harming national security. ‘There is a widespread concern in the military community,’ he said. ‘Intelligence is being publicised that could give advantage to our enemies.’Mr Cameron continued his attack  by directly questioning if the Guardian ‘understood’ what it was doing. He said: ‘When you get newspapers who get hold of vast amounts of information and data, which is effectively stolen, then they have to think about their responsibilities. They have to think about are they helping to keep our country safe? ‘They need to show understanding about the issue and it does go to our ability to fight terrorism.’His deputy entered the row on his regular radio show on LBC. Mr Clegg warned the Guardian was revealing technical information of ‘immense interest’ to terrorists by publishing data on GCHQ’s eavesdropping techniques stolen by Snowden. ‘Secrecy is necessary, of course it is,’ he added. ‘You must absolutely defend the principle of secrecy for the intelligence agencies, without which they can’t keep us safe.’ Mrs May said she agreed with Mr Parker that the leaks were causing huge damage to national security. ‘It is difficult when you have revelations about how security operates,’ she warned. ‘Then that does cause a problem It can give some comfort to terrorists.’ Yesterday, the Mail reported how UK deputy head of national security, Oliver Robbins, had told a court ‘real damage has already been done’. But Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger insists the paper, which revealed details of mass surveillance programmes by the US and UK, has been careful not to publish any material harmful to Britain’s interests.

New research claims that vitamin D supplements have no effect if you are taking them to prevent against osteoporosis . Taking vitamin D supplements does not improve bone strength and is a waste of time for women trying to stave off osteoporosis, claim researchers. A new review of studies involving more than 4,000 healthy adults concludes that supplements fail to increase the density of bone at the hip, spine, forearm, or in the body as a whole. Taking steps to increase bone mineral density is widely thought to be essential in preventing fractures in later life. Hundreds of thousands of women take supplements in the UK either prescribed by their doctor for osteoporosis - thinning bones - or bought over the counter as ‘bone insurance’. Professor Ian Reid from the University of Auckland in New Zealand, who led the study published in The Lancet medical journal, said close to half of adults aged 50 and older use vitamin D supplements, but for many people it will not make any difference. He said ‘Most healthy adults do not need vitamin D supplements. ‘Our data suggest that the targeting of low-dose vitamin D supplements only to individuals who are likely to be deficient could free up substantial resources that could be better used elsewhere in healthcare.’ Prof Reid and colleagues carried out a systematic review of 23 randomised trials examining the effects of using vitamin D supplements to boost bone mineral density in 4,082 healthy adults aged 59 on average up to July 2012. The results did not show any effects for people who took vitamin D for an average period of two years, apart from a small increase in bone density at the femoral neck (forming part of the hip joint). But this change would be unlikely to provide any real medical benefits to the individual, says the report. According to the research the supplements do not improve bone strength . It said ‘This systematic review provides very little evidence of an overall benefit of vitamin D supplementation on bone density. ‘Continuing widespread use of vitamin D for osteoporosis prevention in community-dwelling adults without specific risk factors for vitamin D deficiency seems to be inappropriate.’ Vitamin D is essential for the immune system, strong healthy bones and teeth, and the absorption of calcium, and there is growing evidence that vitamin D deficiency may be responsible for triggering a range of diseases, including several cancers. The body makes most of its vitamin D from sunlight, although oily fish is a good dietary source. Older women are more at risk of osteoporosis because the rate of bone loss is accelerated by the menopause. One in two women and one in five men over the age of 50 will break a bone mainly because of the disease. Dr Claire Bowring, medical policy manager of the National Osteoporosis Society said ‘Vitamin D is essential for good bone health. this latest study supports what the National Osteoporosis Society has been saying for years: the best source for most people is safe summer sunlight exposure, and that only people at risk of vitamin D deficiency should take a supplement. ‘The Department of Health identifies the following groups pregnant and breastfeeding women, under 5s, people with darker skin, older people aged 65 and over and those with low or no exposure to the sun as being at risk of vitamin D deficiency.’ Dr Carrie Ruxton, from the Health Supplements Information Service, said ‘Vitamin D deficiency continues to be a major problem in the UK where up to a quarter of adults have inadequate blood vitamin D levels, according to Government data. ‘This is due to our turbulent weather and dark winters, which restrict how much vitamin D our bodies can make, as well as low intakes of oily fish which is the best natural source of vitamin D.‘In terms of bone health, vitamin D promotes calcium absorption and its utilisation by bone, having the strongest impact on bone density when taken alongside dietary calcium. ‘Therefore, it is unsurprising that the meta-analysis found no significant impact of vitamin D when taken alone. It is also worth remembering that vitamin D is needed for more than bone health. ‘Emerging evidence suggests a role in immune function, maintenance of heart health and even prevention of chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis. ‘This is why I disagree with the findings of the Lancet study and would actually recommend that more people consider a daily vitamin D supplement, particularly with winter approaching.’ In the UK, the Food Standards Agency does not recommend a specific daily dose of vitamin D unless you are elderly, pregnant, Asian, get little sun exposure and eat no meat or oily fish when 10mcg is advised. It says daily supplements of 25mcg are unlikely to cause harm. The danger with taking excessive doses for long periods is that the body absorbs too much calcium, which could weaken bones and possibly damage liver and kidneys.","No increase in bone density according to study published in The Lancet .

Martian dust covering a more than century-old penny: that's just one of dozens of stunning images captured by the Mars rover Curiosity and beamed back to Earth since it first landed on the Red Planet in August of 2012. The presence of a penny on a $1.8 billion piece of galactic machinery might seem strange. But it's actually tradition - the penny on Curiosity is a nod to the geologists' tradition of placing a coin or other object of reference next to a specimen in order to scale its size. The incredibly high-resolution photo was taken by the rover's MAHLI camera at a distance of five centimeters. MAHLI can acquire images of even higher resolution and can be positioned as close as 2.5 centimeters. However, because the photo of the penny was the first photo taken by the camera on Mars, NASA opted to not place it at its highest focus for the test run. A penny goes a long way: This 1909 penny currently is on the surface of Mars as part of the Curiosity mission . Curiosity: The rover Curiosity is the fourth unmanned rover sent to Mars since 1996. It landed on the Red Planet in August 2012 . The dust covering the penny is not surprising - it was facing directly into a plume of dust stirred up by the rover's engines during its descent onto the surface of Mars on August 6, 2012. The specific penny used for Curiosity's homage to geological tradition also is by design. The penny on the rover is a 1909 'VDB' penny - VDB being the initials of Victor David Brenner, the man who designed the Lincoln penny at the request of President Theodore Roosevelt to commemorate Lincoln's 100th birthday. Samples: The rover comes equipped with a drill that it uses to dig up soil samples and analyze them . Rough terrain: The rover is designed to be able to maneuver through Mars' rocky, treacherous terrain . The penny was first released into circulation in 1909. Other images taken by the rover show the rough terrain of Mars and its dry, rocky surface. Curiosity requires teams working around the clock to keep the bot up and running. There were concerns that with the current government shutdown, the teams of scientists monitoring the rover would be furloughed like other federal employes, leaving the fate of the rover in question. However, Curiosity appears to have received a pass - a spokesperson for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where the rover's mission control is located, tells Mashable that 'Curiosity is doing what Curiosity does - she's roving, taking some images of Mars, still sending those back...right now, things continue on as normal.'","The rover Curiosity has been on Mars since August of 2012 .

One in ten mothers aged 40 and over gives birth to a premature baby, according to official figures. Older mothers are 50 per cent more likely to give birth too soon compared with  younger women. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that 10.1 per cent of babies born to mothers aged 40 or over were delivered before 37 weeks in England and Wales in 2011. This is up slightly on the 9.5 per cent figure for 2007 and compares with 6.7 per cent for mothers aged 25 to 29. The number of live births to mothers aged 40 and over has more than quadrupled over the past three decades – from 6,519 in 1982 to 29,994 in 2012. A normal pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, with a delivery before 37 weeks considered premature. Analysis by the ONS showed that part of the reason for the higher percentage of older mothers giving birth prematurely may be because they are more likely to have twins or triplets. In 2011, 6.2 per cent of babies born to mothers aged 40 or over were multiple births, compared with just 1.2 per cent of babies born to mothers in their teens. Only 5.6 per cent of single births are premature, compared with more than half of babies in multiple pregnancies. There are now more than 60,000 premature births in Britain every year – a record level driven by multiple births caused by IVF treatment and planned Caesarean deliveries. Older mothers are 50 per cent more likely to give birth too soon compared with younger women, a study has revealed . It places a large burden on the NHS, with advances in medical science driving up survival rates among premature babies. But they are still more at risk of dying  and in need of intensive care, while those infants who survive are at greater risk of being disabled. Louise Silverton, director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives, said: ‘These figures support our calls for enough midwives to provide care to the increasing number of older mothers who need more time, attention and monitoring throughout their pregnancy. ‘It demonstrates that births are becoming increasingly complex as more older women give birth, along with other issues such as obesity. ‘This also demonstrates the need for continuity of care for women, which will reap benefits for older women who tend to have more complicated pregnancies.‘These women also need extra care after birth as they have a small baby or babies.’","Number of live births to mothers aged 40 and over has quadrupled .

She last saw him in 1991 when he took the children and told her to 'disappear' before slamming a door in her face.

Police have conducted follow-up interviews and confirmed the mother's identity using scientific evidence, a source told the New York Times. No names were being released as the case remains a murder investigation and no charges have been brought so far. In . July, around the 22nd anniversary of the unsolved case, police . circulated the neighborhood around Dyckman Street in Washington Heights . near the wooded area where the child was found, speaking to residents . and offering a $12,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest . and conviction. The little girl had been malnourished and tests showed she had endured sexual abuse and she died of asphyxia. She was naked except for a hair-tie with yellow plastic baubles on it. She had black hair and was white, possibly Hispanic. The child was badly decomposed, making . her facial features unrecognizable, and no one came forward to claim . her. No one had filed a missing persons report and there were very few . clues. Changing neighborhood: Washington Heights has one of the lowest crime rates in Manhattan, but in the '80s and early '90s, when Baby Hope was killed, the area was deeply affected by a crack cocaine epidemic and gang activity . Even for hardened New York City cops, . the case was a sad and grisly one. Detectives named the girl 'Baby . Hope', in the hope that someone would come forward and help them find . out who she was and what happened to her. Two . years after her discovery, Baby Hope was buried in St Hamond's . ceremony. The police of the 34th Precinct pooled their money and paid . for her gravestone. She was buried in a white communion dress. Years . passed, and still no one came forward. In 2007, Baby Hope's body was . exhumed to try and extract a DNA sample, but her bones were in such bad . condition it was impossible. A . second attempt in 2011, using improved technology yielded a complete .

Hope: Police canvass the neighborhood in Washington Heights where the little girl's body was found 22 years ago . At the time of Baby Hope's death in 1991, Washington Heights was in the thrall of a crack cocaine epidemic and the area was known for gangs and violence. Now, it has one of the lowest crime rates in Manhattan and families with young children walk the streets with impunity.

Malala now lives in Birmingham with her family after recovering from the attempt on her life by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in October last year. A Taliban assassin entered her school bus and shot her in the head to halt her campaign for the right to education for girls in Pakistan. Her life was saved thanks to swift action by doctors in her home country and subsequent treatment in Britain and her way back has earned her plaudits from across the world. Awarded: Malala Yousafzai is presented with the Mirror Pride of Britain Teenager of Courage Award by David Beckham this week . Only after prompt medical treatment in Pakistan and later, following an emergency airlift to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, did she survive. Since the age of 11, Malala has been the voice of  girls' rights in Pakistan and once her medical treatment was completed she addressed the United Nations in July and was feted by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon for her tireless work in the face of adversity. Her words: Malala has told her story in a newly published biography . Today, announcing the award of the Sakharov Prize, the President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz also praised Malala's advocacy on behalf of the millions of girls around the world who are denied their basic right to an education. He said: ‘By awarding the Sakharov Prize to Malala Yousafzai, the European Parliament acknowledges the incredible strength of this young woman. ‘Malala bravely stands for the right of all children to be granted a fair education. ‘This right for girls is far too commonly neglected. ‘Malala has courageously recovered from a Taliban attack and now eloquently advocates through the world for this fundamental and just cause. ‘Let us not forget that Malala is still threatened in Pakistan.’ He added: ‘As tomorrow is the International Day of the Girl Child, I would like to recall that some 250 million young girls around the world cannot freely go to school. ‘Malala's example reminds us of our duty and responsibility to the right to education for children. ‘This is the best investment for the future.’ Noted past recipients of the Sakharov award include two former Nobel Peace Prize winners; former South African president Nelson Mandela and Burmese politician and former political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi.","Malala Yousafzai awarded 2013 Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought .

A casualty consultant who sent a dying woman home from hospital with painkillers had her written apology to the family literally thrown back in her face at an inquest today. Angry mum Carole Woodward flung the hand-written apology across the courtroom towards A&E consultant, Delia Parnham-Cope, as she gave evidence at the inquest in Gloucester. Mrs Woodward’s daughter, Jayne Hughes, 44, died at home on December 19 from an undiagnosed pulmonary embolism - a blood clot on the lungs. She had been rushed into Gloucestershire Royal Hospital A&E two days earlier after becoming dizzy and falling downstairs, banging her head and shoulder, at her home in Lydney, Gloucestershire. Carole Woodward (left) with a picture of her deceased daughter Jayne Hughes and granddaughter Keeley. Delia Parnham Cope (right), the A&E consultant who sent dying Ms Hughes home with painkillers . The inquest heard that Ms Hughes was breathless, had high blood pressure and heart rate and a low oxygen saturation - all symptoms of a pulmonary embolism. But Miss Parnham-Cope made no checks for an embolism or DVT and instead concentrated on checking Ms Hughes’ injuries from the fall. After X-rays and an ECG showed no fractures or heart problems Miss Parnham-Cope sent Ms Hughes home with painkillers and a muscle relaxant drug, diazepam - even though her blood-oxygen level was still falling. Miss Parnham-Jones told the inquest she had not considered DVT or an embolism because Ms Hughes did not complain of leg pain or swelling. Jayne Hughes with her granddaughter. Ms Hughes died of an undiagnosed blood clot on the lungs . The doctor agreed with assistant coroner Katie Skerrett that the decision to discharge Ms Hughes was ‘wrong.’ 'She should have kept Ms Hughes in and reviewed her, looking for signs of low oxygen levels,' she said. The doctor said she had ‘learnt lessons’ from her mistake and had since received extra training in the recognition and management of blood clots as well as how to cope in a busy department and improve communications. The inquest heard that within hours of being discharged from A&E that morning Ms Hughes’ condition was worsening and her worried mum took her to the Severn Bank GP Surgery. There she was seen by locum GP Dr Meenakshi Raina - who decided her symptoms were due to her known conditions of anxiety and asthma and also sent her home. Practice nurse Lorna Bird said when Ms Hughes came in she ‘looked dreadful, very unwell’ and distressed and was breathing rapidly, . She immediately put her on oxygen while waiting to see the GP, she said. 'My memory is that she said she felt ""like I’m dying"" or something of that nature.' Dr Raina said: 'There was no complaint to point me towards pulmonary embolism. She did not complain of pain in the leg or chest pain or coughing up blood all of which were things that would have alerted me to an ambolus.' The inquest heard that night that Ms Hughes felt so poorly she did not get up from the sofa and spent all night there. In the morning she was still the same and her son Lee Weldon, 25, who lived with her helped her to the bathroom and then to bed. He said in a statement that she was feeling hot and complaining of breathlessness, He last saw her alive when he went to bed himself between 11.30pm and midnight - and he found her dead in bed the next morning. The note sent to the family of Jayne Hughes by A&E consultant Delia Parnham Cope . Pathologist Dr Chamia de Cates said Ms Hughes died from bilateral pulmonary embolus caused by a blood clot in a vein of the left calf. Accident consultant Dr Tom Llewellyn, who led a hospital investigation into the tragedy, said symptoms were ‘overlooked’ by Miss Parnham-Cope and a result appropriate treatment was not given. She had failed to undertake a thorough and detailed examination considering all symptoms, he said. This was partly due, he added, to an increasing workload in A&E and also to the absence of a middle grade doctor to assist. Lack of training of nursing staff also played a part. The assistant coroner said she did not find that the failures amounted to a verdict of neglect. Instead she recorded a narrative verdict saying: 'The deceased had a history of asthma, panic attacks and anxiety. 'She suffered a DVT causing pulmonary embolus which on the balance of probabilities caused her to fall on 17th December 2012 , causing admission to hospital later that day where the pulmonary embolus went undiagnosed and the deterioration in her condition went unrecognised.' 'She later attended her GP who declined to re-refer her to hospital. taking the view that her head injury had already been investigated and her breathlessness was due to exacerbation of her asthma and anxiety. Her condition continued to deteriorate and she passed away on 19th Dec 2012.' After the hearing Mrs Woodward said: 'I am not happy. The verdict should have been neglect. My battle starts now because I intend to complain to the doctor’s professional body to get her struck off. 'Miss Parnham-Cope is still working in her £120,000 a year job or whatever it is but my daughter is dead and I am serving a life sentence. 'My daughter had a pulmonary embolism in 2009 and was in hospital for several days so it was a known problem she had. Yet in the inquest the said they could not find any record to show that, which was very convenient for them. 'I was so angry when the consultant was giving evidence that I threw her card back at her. I know I shouldn’t have done but I was so upset to see her there admitting she made a mistake which cost my daughter her life.' 'I assessed Miss Hughes, organised . investigations and subsequently decided Miss Hughes did not need admission. 'I . apologise wholeheartedly that I got your daughter’s diagnosis wrong. I . have spent the last nine months reviewing with my colleagues in the . hospital how I could have made such a mistake.' 'I saw Miss Hughes as a trauma patient. As we were very . busy I focused on rapidly assessing and reviewing patients. 'I saw your . daughter, made decisions about her injuries and was re-assured as her chest x-ray and shoulder x-ray were normal. I then discharged your daughter. 'I clearly should have been looking in depth at what caused your daughter to be unwell and subsequently fallen downstairs. 'Over . the last nine months I have reviewed what has happened, had additional . training and looked very closely at how I practice especially when the . department is busy. 'I can only say sorry and work harder to improve my clinical practice in the future.'","Carole Woodward's daughter Jayne died from an undiagnosed blood clot .

The current period giving notice of a ceremony is to be virtually doubled from 15 days to 28. The move - part of the Immigration Bill announced yesterday - is designed to give immigration officials enough time to investigate whether a proposed union is genuine. Tightened: The move is part of the Immigration Bill published yesterday is designed to make it easier for officials to catch sham marriages . Most sham marriages in Britain involve an EU national with the right to be here marrying someone from outside the EU. But the notification rules will apply equally to all couples - including two Britons - to comply with equality laws. Marriage campaigners welcomed the shift, saying it would help ensure marriages were built on firm foundations. Harry Benson of the Marriage Foundation said: ‘This is good news for all couples. There is lots of evidence that whirlwind romances are more likely to end in tears than couples who spend more time thinking about it.’ The Home Office estimates that some 10,000 applications to stay in Britain a year are based on a ‘false’ wedding or civil partnership. Most sham marriages in Britain take place between an EU nation with the right to be here and someone from outside the EU but the rules will apply equally to all couples . The change was detailed in the Immigration Bill published by the Home Office yesterday, which ministers insist will make it harder for illegal immigrants to set up home in the UK. Illegal migrants will be banned from getting driving licences, opening bank accounts and renting private homes, with new checks imposed on bank managers, landlords and driving instructions. It will also be easier to remove foreign criminals from Britain, refuse them bail and even kick them out first and ‘hear their appeal later’. The sham marriage changes are a major new plank of efforts to fight a serious problem for the authorities. Under existing rules, anyone who wants to marry must tell their local register office or church 15 days before the planned wedding date, and details of the union are then posted on a notice board. From next year, this period will be extended to 28 days. The new rules will allow officials who suspect a bogus wedding may be about to take place to extend the notice period to 70 days - allowing them to investigate. Astonishingly, existing rules restrict the ability of officials from sharing information with the Home Office when they suspect a bogus union is about to take place. These will be scrapped. Foreign nationals from outside the EU wanting to get married in a church will first have to go to the register office and get approval - ensuring the authorities are made aware of the planned wedding. From 2005, migrants from outside the EU were required to obtain a certificate of approval from the Government before they could marry. But this was abolished in 2011 after a court ruled in breached human rights laws. Since then the problem of sham weddings has raised major concerns. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘Sham marriages have for too long been an easy target for migrants seeking to circumvent our immigration rules, often assisted by organised criminals. ‘Registrars are frustrated when they marry couples who are obviously sham; we need more effective tools to deal with it. ‘By extending the marriage and civil partnership notice period to 28 days in England and Wales and allowing this to be increased to 70 days in some circumstances we will make time to investigate, prosecute and remove those involved in sham marriages.’","Most sham marriages in Britain take place between an EU national and a non EU national but rules will apply to all couples - even if both partners are British .

Jon Chapman, 43, was left devastated when he was told his arm would have to be amputated after he developed a cancerous lump in his right hand. But instead of ending his career, Mr Chapman's engineer neighbour John Freestone developed a solution - interchangeable tools that fitted onto his prosthetic right arm. Talented: Cobbler James Chapman feared for his job when he lost his arm to cancer, but he has been able to continue work thanks to this prosthetic arm . At work: Mr Chapman is able to fit a hammer, pliers and a Stanley knife to his arm . Mr Champman is now able to fit a hammer, pliers and a Stanley knife to his arm, allowing him to continue cutting keys and mending shoes at his shop in Derby. Customers at his shop, which he has run for 30 years, have even affectionately nicknamed him ‘The human Swiss army knife’. He has now been awarded the prestigious Craftsman of the Year award after beating hundreds of nominations from across the country. Mr Chapman, who lives with his wife Kim, 43, and daughter Olivia, 14, in Mickleover, Derbyshire, first noticed a lump while on holiday in 2004 which turned out to be cancer. After three months of radiotherapy the lump was gone and he was given the all clear but two years later the cancer returned to his hand. This time doctors told him they had to amputate his hand and part of his lower arm to prevent the cancer spreading. Tools of the trade: Mr Chapman's engineer neighbour John Freestone developed the prosthetic arm which can be fitted with interchangeable tools . His neighbour then developed the prosthetic which allows him to continue with his work. Mr Chapman said: 'It has been difficult but the attachments for my prosthetic right arm have really helped. 'I can now hold a nail and put it in with a hammer, which I couldn't do before.' Mr Chapman said: 'You just have to be positive. There are certain things I still can't do but Jake, my assistant, is there to help me.

One of Jamie Bulger's killers was rehoused to a bail hostel just a few yards from a children's play ground, it has been claimed. Jon Venables, 31, was released from prison in August this year with a fourth new identity after being hauled back to prison in 2010 for possessing child porn. But now it's been claimed that authorities housed . him in a bail hostel somewhere in the north of England, a short distance from a playground, to prepare him for life in the community. The revelation provoked fury from Jamie Bulger's father. Paroled: Jon Venables, pictured left, after his arrest for the murder of Jamie Bulger, right, in 1993 has been released to live in a bail hostel near a children's park somewhere in the north of England, it is claimed . ‘Venables is a ticking time bomb just waiting to strike at children,’ Ralph Bulger told friends, according to the Sun. ‘I . can’t believe the authorities would be so stupid as to put a convicted . pervert and child killer near a kids’ park’, he said, adding: ‘His . history speaks for itself how warped, violent and predatory he is and he . is just let loose to pose a grave risk to youngsters again.’ The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the case. Chilling: CCTV footage showed Venebles and Robert Thompson leading young James away by the hand in a Bootle shopping centre . Sadistic: Jamie Bulger was found on a railway line where he was battered to death by Venables and Thompson in 1993 . Venables and friend Robert Thompson, both ten at the time, were jailed for eight years for sadistically killing toddler Jamie, two, in 1993. The toddler was abducted from a shopping centre in Bootle and subjected to a horrific attack near a railway line that shocked the nation. Jon Venables was first released from prison in 2001, at the age of 18, and given a new identity to protect him from the risk of vigilante attacks. At the time, a psychiatrist ruled that he did not pose a danger to the public and was extremely unlikely to commit any further offences. However, he developed drinking and drugs problems, and he compromised his identity at least twice by telling friends he was a convicted murderer. When a probation officer visited his home in Cheshire in 2010 to discuss his fears that he could be in danger, he was attempting to destroy the hard drive of his computer. The hard drive was later examined by police, who discovered that it contained dozens of indecent images of children. Venables admitted that he had posed online as a 35-year-old woman who had abused her eight-year-old daughter, and was returned to prison. Venables was first given a new identity when he and Thompson were sent to a young offenders' institution for murdering the toddler. A second new identity was created for him when he was released in 2001, and he was given a third identity after he was sent back to jail in 2010 for possessing child abuse images. Venables left prison in September this year with a fourth new identity, taking the total cost of his secret identities to £1million. Bulger's relatives were only . given a message that he had been set free days after he was released, to . protect his right to anonymity. And . despite recommendations by an official review into how Venables was . allowed to re-offend last time he was released, he has not been fitted . with a new sat-nav GPS tagging bracelet. The device would allow probation officers to remotely monitor his every move. Former . Home Office mandarin Sir David Omand said the tag could stop him . sneaking back to Liverpool – which he did repeatedly last time. Under . the terms of his release, Venables has been banned from trawling sex . sites on the internet and once again ordered to stay away from . Merseyside.

Two penises carved on a Roman wall, which were probably intended to protect citizens from evil spirits, have been discovered in Italy. The 2,000-year-old stone could reveal the origin of Aosta, a city in the north of the country. Archaeologists believe the phallic symbols could show a connection between the city and the Roman Emperor Augustus. Two penises engraved on a 2,000 year old stone may shed light on the foundation of the city of Aosta in northern Italy, revealing its deep connection with the Roman emperor Augustus. They could also have been intended to ward off evil forces . Giulio Magli, professor of archaeoastronomy at Milan's Polytechnic University, told Discovery News the penis carvings show the ancient city was built during Augustus' rule during the winter solstice. The carvings, plastered with mud, were unearthed during restoration work of one of the city's old towers. Despite being incredibly old, the stone can still be found where it was placed by a Roman builder - on the southeast corner of a monument known in the city as Balivi Tower. Archeologist Stella Bertarione, who found the carved stone, said: 'Originally, the stone stood in plain . view. But in the early Middle Ages the tower was probably flooded and . its basis covered by alluvial material.' The block is carved on two of its faces. On one side a spade is carved over the penis. In Roman times the winter solstice was represented by a Capricorn symbol (pictured) and was also the emblem of Emperor Augustus. The archeologists said the Emperor might have chosen the sign as it suggests the idea of renewal as well as the midwinter sun, which nicely symbolises a new golden era of prosperity . While the other side is more damaged, it is still possible to make out another phallus, this time with a plough and a figure that might be a Capricorn, above it. According to the experts, the plough and spade both allude to the original trench ploughed to mark the perimeter of a new city, called the sulcus primigenius, which formed part of the Roman foundation ceremony. However, it is thought the pair of penises relate to the god Priapus and were carved to muster some sort of protection for the dwellers of the city, against forces of evil. The carving, plastered with mud, was unearthed during restoration work of one of the Aosta's old towers. The Roman city is surrounded by the Alps, which can be seen in this image of a street . While it might seem a shame that the carvings have been hidden from view for so long, the archaeologists believe they have been protected not only from damage, but from censorship. Dr Bertarione said: 'In medieval times the evident phallic figures would have been erased since they were regarded as obscene pagan symbols.' Interestingly, she said that the tips of the two phalli point to the south east, where the sun rises in the winter months. The sunrise would be in clear view from the tower, which stands at the highest point of the city. Dr Magli thinks this is deliberate and that Roman urban planners factored in the complicated natural horizon of the Alps, of which where Aosta's valley is nestled. The tower faces the sunrise on the winter solstice and Dr Bertarione believes the city was founded on December 23 on the day that the sun rises in the direction that the phalli are pointing on the carved stone. In Roman times the winter solstice was represented by a Capricorn symbol and was also the emblem of Emperor Augustus - despite the fact he was born a Libra. The archeologists said the Emperor might have chosen to go with the Capricorn sign as it suggests the idea of renewal as well as the midwinter sun, which nicely symbolises a new golden era of prosperity. They suggest the city could have been built to reflect this golden age and sit in with the cosmic sign of  Capricorn and the winter solstice.","Archaeologists believe the 2,000-year-old phallic symbols could show a connection between Aosta and the Roman Emperor Augustus .

The UK will take a decade to close the ‘skills gap’ with other countries because too few students study science, engineering and maths. So-called STEM subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths - are essential to keep pace in the technological race that fuels the global economy today. But 59 per cent of employers and 71 per cent of universities said there aren’t enough people being trained to the standard needed - and predicted it would take at least ten years to tackle the problem. The UK needs 10 years to bring science, technology, engineering and maths training to the level it requires to thrive. File picture . An overwhelming majority in both groups agreed the deficit had to be addressed for the UK to remain competitive. The survey followed a damning report earlier this week which showed England is the only developed country where 16-24-year-olds are worse at maths and English than their grandparents. Graduates from English universities are also less advanced than school leavers in some countries including Japan, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The report - which warned England was falling behind global competitors - destroyed Labour’s record on education during 13 years in power. Researchers even backed critics who said rising exam results had been caused by grade inflation rather than improving standards. Further damage was done yesterday by Department for Education figures which revealed sixth forms and colleges had been failing pupils by allowing them to drop maths and English before they have achieved a decent grade at GCSE. Deficit: A total of 71 per cent of universities said there aren¿t enough people being trained to the standard needed . In maths, 93 per cent of those without a C by the time they finished secondary school had still not achieved the grade by 18 if they stayed in education. Some 83 per cent were not made to continue the subject. The figures in English were 92 per cent and 85 per cent respectively. Education Secretary Michael Gove tackled the issue last month by announcing teenagers would have to keep trying to get a C in both subjects until they were 18. More than half of the 300 businesses and 24 leading Russell Group academics who took part in the STEM survey said more money needed to be invested in teaching the subjects. They also called for closer collaboration between industry and academia to improve take-up and for industry to have a greater say in the curriculum. The number of undergraduates studying STEM subjects was 632,000 in 2011/12, an increase of 13.6 per cent over five years. But a report by the Social Market Foundation think-tank earlier this year said this was not enough to meet demand. An extra 40,000 graduates were needed each year to meet the 100,000 vacancies being created by the ageing workforce, it added. Dr Coorous Mohtadi of computer software developer MathWorks, which commissioned the STEM survey, said: ‘This report tells us two important things. ‘First, that more needs to be done to encourage students to study STEM subjects in tertiary education. ‘Second, that STEM curricula need to better reflect the requirements of industry, bearing in mind that during their careers students will need to solve problems that are not yet known, using technologies that haven’t been invented yet.’ Demand from universities for students to study traditional subjects has led to an increase in applications to read subjects such as maths and science. The Department for Business, Innovations and Skills has also set up a £200 million fund to boost science and engineering departments, under which universities are expected to match the funding. A BIS spokeswoman said: ‘It is vital the UK has the skills we need to ensure our businesses stay ahead in the global race.

Canadian writer Alice Munro, a thorough, but forgiving documenter of the human spirit, won the Nobel Prize in literature on Thursday for being a 'master of the contemporary short story,' the Swedish Academy said. Munro is the first Canadian writer to receive the prestigious $1.2 million award since Saul Bellow, who won in 1976 and left for the U.S. as a boy. The 82-year-old is regarded as a modern Chekhov for her warmth, insight and compassion, and for capturing a wide range of lives and personalities without passing judgment on her characters. Canadian author Alice Munro has won this year's Nobel Prize in literature, it was announced today, with the Swedish Academy declaring her a 'master of the contemporary short story' Her writing has brought her numerous awards. She won a National Book Critics Circle prize for Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage, and is a three-time winner of the Governor General’s prize, Canada’s highest literary honor. 'I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win,' Munro said by telephone when contacted by The Canadian Press in Victoria, British Columbia. The permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, Peter Englund, said he had not managed to get hold of her but left a message on her answering machine. 'She has taken an art form, the short story, which has tended to come a little bit in the shadow behind the novel, and she has cultivated it almost to perfection,' Englund told The Associated Press. Munro is the 13th female literature laureate in the 112-year history of the Nobel Prizes. Her published work often turns on the difference between Munro’s youth in Wingham, a conservative Canadian town west of Toronto, and her life after the social revolution of the 1960s. In an interview with AP in 2003, she described the 1960s as 'wonderful'. Timeless talent: Munro's books will likely see a resurgence in popularity after she was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature on Thursday . It was 'because, having been born in 1931, I was a little old, but not too old, and women like me after a couple of years were wearing miniskirts and prancing around,' she said. Munro, the daughter of a fox farmer and a teacher, was born Alice Anne Laidlaw. She was a literary person in a nonliterary town, concealing her ambition like a forbidden passion. 'It was glory I was after … walking the streets like an exile or a spy,' recalls the narrator of Munro’s Lives of Girls and Women, a novel published in 1971. She received a scholarship to study at the University of Western Ontario, majoring in journalism, and was still an undergraduate when she sold a story to CBC radio in Canada. She dropped out of college to marry a fellow student, James Munro, had three children and became a full-time housewife. By her early 30s, she was so frightened and depressed she could barely write a full sentence. Her good fortune was to open a bookstore with her husband, in 1963. Stimulated by everything from the conversation of adults to simply filling out invoices, her narrative talents resurfaced but her marriage collapsed. Her first collection, Dance of the Happy Shades, came out in 1968 and won the Governor’s prize. She later married Gerald Fremlin, a geographer. Last year’s Nobel literature award went to Mo Yan of China. The 2013 Nobel announcements continue Friday with the Nobel Peace Prize, followed by the economics prize on Monday.","She is regarded as a modern Chekhov and 'master of the short story'

A convicted drink-driver who drove the wrong way down a dual carriageway and ploughed into a car killing a 'besotted' young couple who planned to marry has been jailed for eight years. William Wilson, 33, crashed head-on with Stephen Donnelly, 26, and his girlfriend Mandy Gold, 21 as they returned from a family wedding. The young churchgoers from Sheffield were travelling along the A14 in Northamptonshire on their way home. Tragedy: 'Dreadful' drink-driver William Wilson ploughed into besotted young couple Stephen Donnelly, 26, and his girlfriend Mandy Gold, 21 when he drove on the wrong side of the road . Wilson, of Brigg in South Humberside, was twice the drink drive limit, having drunk equivalent of up to four pints, and had been seen slowing down, accelerating and clipping kerbs before he killed the couple. He pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and to drink driving at Northampton Crown Court. Judge Richard Bray said: 'This is a tragic case in which the lives of two young people have been lost. No penalty can compensate for these sad deaths. 'This was a dreadful course of dangerous driving. You drove on the wrong side of the carriageway and they had no chance of avoiding instant death.' Todd Roberts, a friend of the young couple and a senior pastor at the church, said following the tragedy: 'They were a devoted couple, they were besotted with each.' Wilson was returning home from a traveller's fair when the collision occurred on June 27. Alexandra Bull, prosecuting, said a couple, saw Stephen and Mandy's Ford car move into the outside lane to overtake when they heard a massive bang. She said: 'The witness saw two people trapped in the car. Wilson, who appeared dazed, said ""What have I done?"". 'Young and in love': Churchgoers Stephen and Mandy had planned to marry until they were robbed of a future together . Stephen and Mandy started dating after meeting through the church they both attended. Message: Jailing Wilson for eight years Judge Richard Bray said: 'No penalty can compensate for these sad deaths' The pair were went on a missionary trip to Poland together last year and friends said they were 'young and in love'. Stephen, a former pure mathematics student at the University of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, joined the church in 2007 and became part of its staff as a student pastor a year later. Volunteer Mandy was a student life group leader at the church and also helped out with Sunday school and women's Bible groups. Gwyn Lewis, representing Wilson, who is from a traveller family, said: 'This is a tragic case for the families whose lives were changed in an instant. 'They suffered a tragic loss which they have dealt with in a very dignified manner. No sentence, no matter what type or length, can lessen the anguish of these families. 'This will remain a jigsaw that doesn't fit and a mystery he will never, ever understand,' he added. 'He is genuinely remorseful and has written to both bereaved families. He struggles with the consequences of his actions. 'It's the first thing he thinks of in the morning and the last thing he thinks of at night. He unequivocally accepts responsibility.' Wilson, who was convicted of drink driving when he was 17, was banned from driving for 10 years.","William Wilson killed Stephen Donnelly, 26, and his girlfriend Mandy Gold, 21 .

Hungry: The British Red Cross is to distribute food to poorer families for the first time since the Second World War in a bid to tackle food poverty . The British Red Cross is to start distributing food to hard-up families for the first time since the Second World War as it warned that thousands face cuts to their household budgets. Volunteers from the charity will go into supermarkets from next month to ask shoppers to donate tinned and dry food to be passed on to families facing food poverty. The charity blamed a combination of the recession, welfare cuts and the increased cost of living for more UK families struggling to put food on the table. It described its campaign as a 'toe in the water' as it considers further steps to tackle the growing problem of food poverty. Once food is collected from shoppers, it will be passed on to the most needy through the FareShare charity. Juliet Mountford, the charity's head of UK service development, said the Red Cross agreed to assist FareShare on the basis of 'strong evidence of an increased need for support on food poverty issues'. Nearly 500,000 people in the UK needed support from food banks last year, according to figures from the Trussel Trust. Last month a report shed light on the chronic throw-away culture affecting the food industry, where up to two-fifths of a crop of fruit or vegetables can be wasted because it is 'ugly'. Produce grown in the UK that does not meet retailer standards on size or shape or is blemished is often used for animal feed or simply ploughed back into the ground even though it is edible, with as much as 40 per cent of a crop rejected. The report, commissioned by the UK's global food security programme, also showed that the average household throws away more than 5kg (11lb) of food per week, and nearly two-thirds of that is avoidable. The waste costs £480 a year per household on average, and £680 per family. Households throw away a fifth of the food they buy, wasting it for reasons ranging from cooking and preparing too much to not using it before it goes off, the study showed. Campaign: Red Cross volunteers will be asking people shopping in supermarkets to donate some food to the campaign . Consumption and initial production are the areas where the majority of food is wasted in the UK, the study said. According to a Red Cross report released today the number of people relying on food aid has increased by 75 per cent across Europe over the last three years with an estimated 43 million struggling for enough food to eat. A further 120million are at risk of poverty, according to the Independent. Bekele Geleta, the Secretary General of the International Federation of the Red Cross, warned governments on the continent against 'indiscriminate cuts' to health and social care funding.","The charity will distribute food to poor families for the first time since Second World War .

An environmental health officer stunned a florist by claiming her display model of Alice in Wonderland’s caterpillar was breaking anti-smoking laws. Debbie Schofield, 32, had put the wooden model of the hookah puffing character from the 1951 Disney movie in her front window to attract customers. But instead she got an unexpected visit from a council officer who noticed the model, which was sat on a wooden toadstool, was in possession of a real shisha pipe and looked as if it was smoking. Not amused: Debbie Schofield outside her flower shop, which a council officer suspected might be a shisha den as it has a wooden caterpillar holding a pipe in the window . In the iconic cartoon movie the caterpillar blew smoke rings in the shape of letters and was famed for its phrase ‘Whooo… are… you?’ The . council officer warned Ms Scholfield that the wooden caterpillar might . be in breach of laws preventing employees from smoking in the workplace . and said he should investigate further. He . also claimed the presence of a shisha pipe led him to believe Ms . Schofield might be running an illegal shisha pipe ‘smoking den.’ Ms Schofield . said she refused to let the officer investigate further, and instead . put a flea in his ear - telling him to leave the shop, Ewood Florists in . Bolton Street, Blackburn, Lancashire. On Friday Ms Schofield . said: ‘I couldn’t believe what this man was saying. It was so surreal I . thought I was in Wonderland myself at the Mad Hatter's tea party. ‘He . told me he’d come in to investigate because there had been a complaint . that the shisha pipe was contravening UK smoking in the workplace . regulations. ‘I said, ""But it’s a wooden caterpillar,"" and he said ""yes, but it’s smoking"", and I said ""no, it’s not"". Classic character: The caterpillar featured in Disney's 1951 Alice in Wonderland animation and sits on a wooden toadstool in Ms Schofield's shop window . ‘I really thought someone was winding me up, I wasn’t taking it seriously. ‘It’s not even a real shisha pipe, it’s an ornament, it doesn’t work. ‘But he didn’t have a problem with the shisha pipe, it was the caterpillar smoking on business premises. ‘I said to him, even if it was a real caterpillar the chances of it lighting the pipe were pretty thin, but the fact that it’s a wooden caterpillar renders it impossible.’ ‘I wouldn’t let him investigate, I said to him ""if you haven’t got better things to do, I certainly have, you need to leave"". ‘He said there was a real problem in Blackburn with shisha. I don’t know if that’s with caterpillars smoking it. ‘I did think about getting the caterpillar an electronic cigarette, or putting him on patches or something!’ The enigmatic caterpillar which was voiced by actor Richard Hayden in the Disney movie was part of a display which features several characters from the Lewis Carroll books Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass. Its memorable phrase is a breathy ‘Whooo… are… you?’ was visualised as exhalations of smoke in the shapes ‘O’, ‘R’ and ‘U’. Enigmatic: The caterpillar blows smokey letters at Alice in the Disney film, before transforming into a butterfly . Alice remarks in the original story that the Caterpillar will one day turn into a butterfly and in the Disney film he does just that - albeit while angry from Alice’s comment about being only three inches high. The caterpillar was played by actor Alan Rickman in Tim Burton’s flamboyant 2010 remake. Labour run Blackburn Council said the officer had wanted to check that the florist was not operating as an illegal shisha ‘den.’ Councillor Jim Smith, executive member for environment, said: ‘The council public protection officer involved in this case was walking past the florist, saw the display and went in to make sure it was not operating a shisha lounge, which can be hard to detect. ‘The public protection officer was simply carrying out his duties.

A panicked father had to resuscitate his new born son when he momentarily stopped breathing after delivering him in a car at the side of the road... just minutes from a community hospital. Despite pleading with a 999 operator for help, Craig Baker, 25, was told 'nobody' at the hospital could come to his aid as his new baby struggled to breathe. Mr Baker was driving his partner Gemma Fraser, 23, to Hull Royal Infirmary after she went into labour with her second child Nathan. Craig Baker was forced to give newborn son Nathan, mouth-to-mouth after stopping minutes away from a nearby hospital. He was forced to deliver the baby, pictured with mother Gemma Fraser and sister Phoebe . But by the time the pair, from Kilham in East Yorkshire, reached nearby Beverley, the baby had almost arrived. Mr Baker was left with no choice but to pull over and call an ambulance and begin to deliver the baby himself - despite being painstakingly close to another hospital, East Riding Community Hospital. The panicked father assumed someone from the hospital could come to the family's aid. The 999 operator told Mr Baker she would call the hospital for help. But when she came back on the line, the woman told terrified Mr Baker: 'Nobody can help you.' Parked less than five minutes walk from the hospital, Mr Baker was forced to deliver his son in the front passenger seat of their Ford Focus. As little Nathan, who weighed 9lb 4oz, arrived his father feared he had stopped breathing so administered life-saving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. He said it is 'disgusting' that staff at the nearby hospital - which does not have a maternity department - failed to come to his family's aid. The couple were en route to the Hull Royal Infirmary when baby Nathan made his sudden arrival . Mr Baker said: 'I delivered the baby while I was on the phone to the ambulance lady. 'She said she would ring through to the Community Hospital in Beverley but she came back on and said ""nobody can help you"". 'It’s disgusting, really - it didn’t have to be a midwife, a doctor could have come out or just anybody with some towels, they would have known more than me - but nothing. 'I had to give him mouth-to-mouth, he was moving his hands and then he just froze. 'I was panicking and the lady on the phone talked me through what to do. He started crying and then he stopped. I had to do it again. 'It was all very scary. It’s not something you can prepare yourself for.' Nathan was born at 3.28pm on September 24 - six minutes before an ambulance arrived. He was taken with his parents by ambulance to Hull Royal Infirmary and is now back at home with his older sisters, Phoebe, two and Izzy, five. Six minutes after baby Nathan arrived at 3.28pm on September 24, an ambulance arrived to take him and his parents to Hull Royal Infirmary . Miss Fraser said: 'He was four days late. We rang the hospital at 12.45pm and they told me to take two paracetemol and have a hot bath and ring back in an hour. 'Twenty minutes later I had four contractions in five minutes. I rang back and they told me to go through.' Services at Beverley Community Hospital are provided by Humber NHS Foundation Trust and Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust.

Britain’s top tax officials are to face tough questions about their failure to make big businesses pay their way as damning new figures show £35billion-a-year goes uncollected. HM Revenue and Customs today admitted that the so-called ‘tax gap’ has despite public outrage at avoidance schemes used by the likes of Google, Facebook and comedian Jimmy Carr. The taxpayer lost £35billion in unpaid tax in 2011-12, a figure which has remained almost static for the last five years. Gap: New figures show how the amount of tax owed which is not collected has barely changed since 2005 . HMRC boasted that as a percentage of all taxes owed, the amount which goes uncollected has ‘fallen steadily over the last six years’. But the Commons spending watchdog is to grill officials from HMRC in the coming weeks over the lack of significant progress in collecting tax owed to the Treasury. Exchequer Secretary David Gauke said: ‘These figures show the tax gap is continuing to fall. The vast majority of businesses and individuals pay the taxes they owe. ‘But where they don’t it is for HMRC to challenge non-compliance fiercely, protecting money that would otherwise be lost.’ This week it emerged Facebook paid no corporation tax in Britain last year despite raking in more than £200million from its UK operations, documents reveal. It means the internet giant has paid just £1million in corporation tax on the half a billion pounds of revenue it has made since arriving in Britain in 2007. Fed up: Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said HMRC had failed to make a dent in the figures . Google was accused in May this year of ‘doing evil’ by avoiding British taxes. Starbucks also attracted criticism after it emerged last year that it had paid no UK corporation tax in the previous three years. In January last year stand-up Jimmy Carr admitted to a ‘terrible error of judgement’ after it emerged he used the K2 scheme which enabled members to pay income tax rates as low as 1 per cent. Ahead of the hearing Margaret Hodge, the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, told MailOnline: ‘I don’t think they are assertive or aggressive enough. ‘I am really disappointed that, despite all the public concern expressed by hardworking people who do pay their taxes, there has not been greater success. ‘There is scepticism about how they calculate the tax gap anyway, it is a conservative estimate. ‘Only this week we had the news about Facebook and others. ‘Whilst I recognise that we have to take action internationally, it doesn’t excuse HMRC not defending the taxpayers’’ interest or their failure to make a noticeable dent in the figures.’ The value of the tax gap has increased from £32billion in 2009-10 to £35 billion in 2011-12. The percentage tax gap has fallen very slightly from 7.3 per cent to 7 per cent over the same period. Edward Troup, HMRC’s Tax Assurance Commissioner, said: ‘The range of non-compliance behaviours revealed by these tax gap figures underline why it is so important for HMRC to step up our wide-ranging activities against the minority who aren’t paying what’s due, whether they are SMEs, individuals, big business or organised criminals. ‘This isn’t just critical for the nation’s finances: it’s also important to protect the vast majority of honest businesses and individuals from being cheated by the unscrupulous few.’ But Shabana Mahmood, Labour's shadow exchequer secretary said: 'At a time when millions are struggling with the rising cost of living and the deficit is high, it's even more vital that everyone pays their fair share of tax. 'But these figures show the government is failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion with the value of the tax gap now up to £35 billion. 'And David Cameron is so out of touch that he's just given a £3 billion tax cut to people on over £150,000, while falling real wages mean ordinary working people are on average £1500 a year worse off.'","HM Revenue and Customs under fire after failing to tackle unpaid tax .

A Spanish electro pop act has been released after a being kidnapped by the notorious Los Zetas cartel in Mexico. Delorean, a Barcelona-based four-piece, were held hostage in a Mexico City hotel for 30 hours by the drug lords, who demanded nearly a quarter of a million pounds for their lives. Fortunately, local police were able to track the Zetas, famous for gruesome torture methods and mass murders, and band members have been able to return to Spain. Kidnapped: Spanish electro pop band Delorean were taken by Los Zetas - one of Mexico's most dangerous drug cartels - after playing at a music festival . Delorean had returned to their Mexico city hotel following a performance at a festival when they were lured into a hostage situation through a fake phone call from the Zetas cartel. They were told they had to vacate the premises due to a shootout, but they were taken by cartel members as soon as they complied. Ekhi Lopetegi, Guillermo Astrain, Unai Lazcano, and Igor Escudeo, originally from the Basque country, were taken to a different hotel and locked in two separate rooms, El Pais reports. The Zetas then contacted their family member s demanding a ransom of five million Mexican peso – approximately £240,000 – for their safe return. Thanks to various police forces including Interpol, the source of the phone calls made to the band’s hotel could be tracked and after 30 hours in captivity the four men could be released. Taken hostage: Ekhi Lopetegi, left, and his band mates Guillermo Astrain, Unai Lazcano, and Igor Escudeo were held for 30 hours on a £240,000 ransom . Official statement: Delorean posted their version of events on their Facebook page . On Wednesday the band posted their version of the events on their official Facebook page: . Los Zetas is one of the most dangerous and powerful crime syndicates in Mexico. The cartel is known for committing some of the most brutal crimes in Latin America as part of their on-going turf war with rival cartels. Los Zetas was set up by a group of defectors from the Mexican Special Forces in the early 1990s and grew into one of the most powerful and brutal groups in the area within its first two decades. After splitting from the Gulf Cartel in 2010, the cartel embarked on one of the most violent turf wars in modern Latin American history, turning Mexico into a battle ground. As well as smuggle drugs, control local crime syndicates, bribe and kidnap, Los Zetas use fear, torture and mass murder to stay in power. The group is responsible for several of Mexico's bloodiest massacres in the 10s including the San Fernando Massacres of 2010 and 2011 where 72 and 193 people respectively, were found tortured and brutally murdered. Los Zetas has been branded the ‘most technologically advanced, sophisticated, and dangerous cartel operating in Mexico’ by the US Government. ‘On Monday morning October 7th we received a phone call at our hotel room in Mexico City from a person posing as a hotel security officer. We were informed that there was a security threat at the hotel. ‘What followed for the next 30 hours was an experience where the threat of death was real due to the psychological manipulation inflicted on us by our kidnappers.

The UK's major network operators have been forced to deny claims the rollout of 4G has had a negative affect on older, 3G services after a string of customer complaints. Yet a MailOnline investigation has revealed internet services and calls in certain parts of the country have dropped since 4G became more widely available. It's been a year since EE launched its 4G network in the UK, and just over a month since Vodafone and O2 began rolling out their respective services. Customers have taken to Twitter to complain that the 4G switch-on has made older services, including 3G internet, calls and texts slower and less reliable, yet mobile operators deny this. A MailOnline investigation has revealed internet services in some areas of the country have dropped since the rollout of 4G. It's been a year since EE launched its 4G network in the UK, and just over a month since Vodafone and O2 began rolling out their respective services. A Watchdog investigation was launched in September after a stream of complaints criticised EE's 4G service. They ranged from complaints about internet speeds to a rise in call failures and overall poor service. It discovered that at times operators may suggest to customers that when they're having trouble with their 4G service, they should switch down to 3G temporarily. However, this may put the 3G network under too much strain and affect the performance of this slower speed, as well. EE apologised to customers if they had suffered poor service but denied there was was an overreaching problem: . 'It is entirely correct that when a 4G user makes a Voice call the call is currently passed through the 3G network - most importantly, there is no negative experience for customers caused by this.' One O2 customer explained to MailOnline how he streams videos on the train on his way home from work in London. He used to be able to stream a football TV show on his Google Nexus 4 on his homebound journey but now the signal drops 'regularly' and it has become 'impossible to watch.' 'If I try to stream a video, or open sites with pictures on, the internet grinds to a halt. 'I never used to have any problems and I haven't changed my route home, or my phone - it's frustratingly poor,' he said. 'I'm sure it has something to do with 4G launching in London. It's too much of a coincidence not to be and other people I know have complained about similar problems.' Tom Reynolds on Twitter added he has noticed a difference since the 4G switch-on: 'On 3G, sometimes Twitter, Facebook and internet is slower than usual.' Although adds that this may be due to his handset. While Sarah Aldridge tweeted hers has been more 'rubbish than usual.' When asked for comment, Vodafone denied its network had been affected and told MailOnline: 'We’ve checked with our technical teams and there have been no unusual activity on our 3G network. Customers have taken to Twitter to complain the 4G switch-on has made older services, including 3G internet, calls and texts slower and less reliable, yet mobile operators including O2 and Vodafone deny this. O2's CEO Ronan Dunne believes 4G investment will boost 2G and 3G services . 'Our 4G service works on a different part of the airwaves than our 3G and 2G services, so there is no knock on effect for our existing customers. 'We are currently upgrading sites across the country every day to install 4G and to improve existing 2G/3G coverage. 'If readers are complaining about an issue in a specific area, can you please ask them the postcode of the area in which they experienced it and we can investigate.' An O2 spokesman similarly added: 'We’ve spent a number of months getting ready for 4G and carried out rigorous testing to ensure our 3G service isn’t impacted by 4G. 'This will continue as we roll out 4G, improving our depth of coverage and focus on delivering a great network experience for all our customers.' Wireless coverage mapping experts . Root Metrics let users compare the signal strength and coverage of . different networks across the UK. It produces reports that compare the internet speeds, reliability of calls and texts of various providers. In Bristol, used as an example, the . top four providers in July 2013, in terms of internet speeds, were EE, . with a score of 109, Three with a score of 80, O2 with 70 and Vodafone . on 54 (see chart above.) Call reliability in the same month . showed Vodafone had the most call failures (3.4 per cent), Three was in . second at 1.9 per cent, EE suffered 1.5 per cent call dropouts and O2 . was on 1.2 per cent. When this is compared to the same . report compiled this month (see chart above) - after Vodafone and O2 have begun . rolling out 4G across the country in addition to the EE service - every single operator dropped . internet speed points. The drops were marginal but EE scored . 106, down three points, Three was on 78.9, O2 dropped 0.2 points to . 69.8 and Vodafone lost almost ten points to 44.9. There was also a rise in the number of call failures across three of the four networks. Vodafone dropped calls 3.8 per cent . of the time, Three was second again at 2.8 per cent. EE had 1.6 per cent . call failures, while O2 stayed the same. Although it is unclear what the . causes for these drops were - and the drops are specific to the Bristol . region meaning it might not be the case nationwide - the figures do indicate services have been adversely . affected in recent months. Figures in Leeds and Bradford, London and Cardiff showed a similar decline in certain services. In response to a tweet by The Telegraph asking whether anyone had experienced problems, WG Grut admitted: '3G has definitely got noticeably slower on O2 since 4G launch,' and Ayres the Baker added: ' I won't be signing up to 4G until they can demonstrate its reliable. 3G is most certainly not at the moment!' A Watchdog report was launched recently after a stream of complaints criticised EE's 4G service. They ranged from complaints about internet speeds to a rise in call failures and overall poor service . O2's CEO Ronan Dunne tweeted: 'On average 3G speeds are higher - dual band devices and HSPA+. Offset in part by growth in traffic - new spectrum helps this. 'The investment in 4G will improve the 2G and 3G experience as well.' Commenting on the news, Oliver Folkard, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com told MailOnline: 'The rumour-mill may well prove to have legs but, for now at least, it's too early to tell if the launch of 4G is impacting 3G speeds. 'Ofcom is busily collecting 3G speeds data and, once Three has launched its 4G service too at the end of this year, we may see more than just anecdotal evidence that this is happening. 'There have been some concerns that T-Mobile and Orange customers would suffer as the spectrum they used for 3G was squeezed by EE launching 4G last October, but again there is no evidence for this yet.' EE, and other experts are also quick to point out that the 4G and 3G spectrums run on different frequencies, so it's unlikely one would directly affect the other. Twitter user Feef said: In the UK, at the moment, 4G is on a different frequency from 3G. Variations will be down to the telco, not the band.' EE and Three are yet to respond to a request for comment. EE, which was formed from the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, was the first company to offer a 4G network in the UK. EE . held the monopoly on the network because regulator Ofcom gave it . permission to use existing spectrum (1800MHz) that it already owned. Ofcom then held an auction for companies to bid to use other parts of the spectrum from 800MhZ to 2.6GHz. O2 purchased 800MHz lots and Vodafone won both 800MHz and 2.6GHz lots. For . the typical user, download speeds of initial 4G networks should be at . least five to seven times faster than those of existing 3G networks. In . July, EE announced it was doubling its 4G speeds for people in . Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Derby, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, . Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield. The speed boost makes the network twice as fast as current average 4G speeds and 10 times as fast as 3G. Mobile . network Three has kicked off a price war earlier this week over the new . 4G service by announcing it will offer the super high-speed internet at . no extra cost. The firm’s . 1.5million customers will get 4G at the same price they pay for the . current 3G network, with packages of calls, texts and unlimited internet . from £15 a month. The Three deal will start in mid December, cashing in on Christmas handset sales.","Customers claim 3G internet speeds have dropped since 4G was enabled .

Oil paintings of women who once featured in an advertising campaign for chocolate brand Aero were hung on Rowntree's York factory walls for decades. Now the company, which was taken over by Nestlé in 1988, wants to solve the mystery of who the women were before it's too late. The brand has launched a nationwide search to find the models who posed for the paintings in the Fifties. Post war campaign: The adverts using regular women as models aimed to show that chocolate was for everyone and not a luxury item . Alex Hutchinson, archive curator at Nestlé explained: 'We are very interested in finding out . who the women are in the pictures to put names to faces that have had a . large presence in the company over the years. 'The paintings are part of the history of our company and because we don't know who they are, we only know half the story. For all: The oil paintings were reproduced in adverts in newspapers and magazines telling people Aero milk chocolate is 'different' 'We don't know anything about these woman . who became the Aero Girls, and we would like to track them down. They . will all be in their 80s now so this could be the last chance.' Aero first went on sale in 1935 but ceased production during World War Two when the nation faced food shortages and rationing. When the makers relaunched Aero in 1951, chocolate was still considered an expensive item. They needed an advertising campaign to show the public that the bubbly treat was . available to anyone. Artists were commissioned to create expensive oil paintings of regular women with the slogan 'Different... For her, Aero - the milk chocolate that's different!' Who's the girl? The models will now be in their Eighties but little is known about them . Mr Hutchinson said the adverts were innovative at the time as they were presented in a 'completely different style . to what the country was used to'. The models are thought to be family and friends of the artists but there is limited information about them. He added: 'During . the war everything was very stylised and cartoon like but for some . reason they decided to make these adverts in a completely different way. 'Using . oil paintings was unusual because they would have been expensive to . reproduce, it would be the equivalent of having a poster made in gold . leaf today. Mystery: The women are thought to be friends and relatives of the commissioned artists . 'They were almost hitting back after the rationing throughout the war by using such an extravagant campaign. 'Rowntree's . commissioned famous artists at the time to paint the portraits who used . normal women as their models, they could have been relatives or . friends. 'We are hoping if we find the women in the poster campaign we can work out what the thought process was behind it.' Do you know who they are? The brand is keen to find out as the paintings have been part of its York factory for decades . The original oil paintings were hung in a corridor leading to the cake department of the original Rowntree's factory in York. When the company moved its production lines in 200,6 some of the oil paintings were removed and taken to auction. Others have become lost over time and, of the original 40, only 20 remain today. Now the company wants to track down the models in the paintings to help with missing details about the advertisements. The paintings will go on display for the first time outside of the factory in an exhibition by the Borthwick Institute for Archives in York. Anyone who has information about the Aero girls should contact archivists on 01904 321166.","Aero went on sale in 1935 but ceased production during World War Two .

Oklahoma Thunder big man Kendrick Perkins is in some big trouble - according to authorities, he punched a woman in the face at a Houston nightclub earlier this year and he's now charged with misdemeanor assault. The alleged incident happened in July outside of the Nox nightclub in the 4700 block of Nett St., when the NBA star and his brother-in-law Quincy Alpough allegedly attacked the woman. Alpough also has been charged with misdemeanor assault. 'Big' trouble: OKC Thunder big man Kendrick Perkins is accused of punching a woman in the face at a night club . According to court documents first obtained by KHOU.com, the alleged victim, Miketta Cotton, and her brother were leaving the club when she and Perkins backed into each other in their vehicles. Cotton told police that after the collision, she got out of her car to talk with the driver of the other vehicle. At that point, she told authorities, a female passenger in Perkins' car jumped out and started taking off her jewelery as if she was ready to fight. Cotton says she managed to calm the woman down, at which point Alpough got out of the car and yelled, 'That's my cousin!' When Cotton's brother, Ja'Keenan Cotton, saw what was happening to his sister, he got out of the vehicle to check on her. Clubbin': Perkins and his brother-in-law were partying in the Nox nightclub in Houston prior to the alleged incident . When the male Cotton exited the vehicle, authorities say Perkins also got out of his vehicle and punched him in the head, knocking him to the ground. With her brother on the ground, Miketta Cotton says Perkins - who stands 6-foot-10 and weighs 270 pounds - punched her in the face, also causing her to fall to the ground. Another woman in the car with the Cottons, Catherine McGrue, told police that Alpough hit her in the throat with his elbow, knocking her unconscious. As the three alleged victims were laying on the ground, authorities say Perkins and Alpough kicked them repeatedly. 'Thug': The alleged fight happened after Perkins' vehicle and the victim's backed into each other . According to authorities, at least one witness confirmed the Cottons' story. Charges in the case initially were filed in July, but were later dismissed. The case was re-filed, however, and Perkins and Alpough were arrested Thursday.

Customers could end up paying more for phone contracts over the next year or so as a direct result of Ofcom increasing the amount it charges operators to rent radio spectrum. Plans unveiled by the telecoms industry regulator reveal it intends to increase rental fees by more than 400 per cent in some cases, to bring the prices in line with the market value in other countries. Mobile operators have slammed the plans as 'disappointing' and 'excessive' and such increases could see operators raising the price for phones, calls, data and monthly contracts to claw back some of this extra money. Ofcom's price increases will vary depending on how much radio spectrum each operator uses. Vodafone and O2 will each pay £83.1m a year - a 433% rise, while EE and Three's are set to increase by 330% to £107.1m and £35.7m respectively. These rises could be filtered to customers, but no official announcement has been made . The price increases will vary depending on how much radio spectrum each operator uses.

This will put EE's new fee at £107.1 million, up from £24.9m. Three's will rise to £35.7 million, up from . £24.9m. Operators currently pay around £64.5 million in total for using the . 900 megahertz and 1800 megahertz spectrum bands. The proposed changes are set to increase this total to around £309 million. Earlier this year, the government raised just £2.34 billion during the 4G spectrum auction - it had hoped to raise £3.5 billion. The price rises are set to give the Treasury an extra £245 million-a-year. The proposals come after Britain raised a less-than-expected £2.34 billion ($3.7 . billion) during the 4G spectrum auction earlier this year- it had hoped to raise £3.5 billion.

Currently Vodafone, Telefonica's O2, EE and Hutchison's H3G (that runs the Three network) pay around £64.5 million in total for using the 900 megahertz and 1800 megahertz spectrum bands. The proposed changes are set to increase this total to around £309 million. 'Spectrum is a valuable and finite national resource, and charging for it can incentivise the optimal use of frequencies,' Ofcom said in a statement. The British government asked Ofcom to recalculate the fees to reflect 'full market value' and Ofcom said the new rules were expected to take effect next year after a consultation period that ends in December. Operators had expected a price rise but Vodafone said it was disappointed by the scale of the increase. It said it was reviewing the details of Ofcom's proposals before responding to the regulator. This chart shows the results of Ofcom's 4G auction, in which parts of the spectrum were bid for by operators. Earlier this year the government raised £2.34 billion during this auction, yet had a target of £3.5 billion. The government asked Ofcom to recalculate the spectrum fees to reflect 'full market value' 'We are however disappointed that Ofcom is proposing a 430 percent increase in the fees we pay for our existing spectrum at a time when we are investing more than ever in vital national digital infrastructure,' a spokesman said in a statement. 'The regulator should be encouraging such private sector investment in infrastructure and new services like 4G, which will benefit consumers, businesses and the wider British economy for many years to come.' An EE spokesman told MailOnline: 'The proposed increase in licence fees is . excessive at a time when the industry needs to invest heavily in the roll out of 4G. 'There must be a balance between licence fees and the . critical 4G network investment consumers and businesses are demanding . to drive growth and jobs for the UK economy.' Other operators are yet to respond. 'Our concern is that it will be mobile users who are left to foot the bill - and it isn’t clear if there will be any direct benefits to them,' added Adam Kirby, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com. 'In fact, providers will no doubt be concerned that their investment in network infrastructure will be limited if they are shelling out more for licence fees. 'No increases [for consumers] have been confirmed as yet - Ofcom are now consulting on the fees.

A new form of methamphetamine has been found in a Texas City middle school after a group of eighth-grade girls began behaving strangely and were caught with the drugs. According authorities, during afternoon classes at Blocker Middle School on Monday the six girls began acting 'zombie-like' and 'delirious'. School staff found small paper squares on the girls that authorities say had been soaked in liquid methamphetamine and then wrapped in foil. High in class: Six junior high school girls in Texas City were caught Monday with what officials are calling a new form of liquid methamphetamine . According to the sheriff's office, the drug is ingested by placing the stamp on the tongue and allowing it to dissolve. Deputies at Galveston County Sheriffs Office say they have never seen methamphetamine in this form before. Liquid methamphetamine is typically found in bottles, and has been found being smuggled over the border from Mexico. The meth-soaked paper is new to the district. School staff immediately called paramedics and the girls were treated at a local hospital before being sent home to their parents. Spokesperson for Texas City ISD Melissa Tortorici said the girls are currently suspended while police investigate the incident.

Airline industry insiders say the next 9/11 style attack is already being planned and that they’ve seen in-flight ‘probes’ being conducted by terrorist groups to test security. The US Airlines Pilots Association recently released a memo internally about ‘several cases recently throughout the (airline) industry of what appear to be probes, or dry runs, to test our procedures and reaction to an in-flight threat.’ Now other unions and even one concerned Air Marshal are speaking out about the threat and about what they say is government reluctance to do something about it. Safe? The US Airlines Pilots Association believes that terrorist 'dry runs' are occurring across the industry as groups plot the next 9/11 style attack . ‘Foolish,’ is what Wolf Koch, a pilot for Delta and chairman at the Air Line Pilots Association International, calls anyone who isn’t eternally vigilant about preventing the next attack. Koch, like the US Airlines union, believes an attack could well be in the works. ‘100%, no question in my mind. They're going to try it again,’ he told WTSP. Part of what scares the unions are events like the one that occurred on US Airlines flight 1880 on September 2 of this year as it flew from Washington, DC to Orlando. The next 9/11? Industry insiders like Wolf Koch of the Air Line Pilots Association International say the the next attempt at a 9/11 style attack is likely in the works. ‘If a dry run's occurring, the attack is shortly following,' he said . In their memo, the US Airlines Pilots Association describes commotion started by a ‘Middle Eastern’ man who bolted from his seat toward the flight deck. Face of evil: Mohamed Atta helped plot the 9/11 attacks and was part of a group who staked out planes in Boston, in what may have been 'dry runs' just a month before the World Trade Center went down . At the last moment, he turned and entered the lavatory. He stayed there for ‘a considerable length of time.’ Meanwhile, his three cohorts began ‘generally making a scene,’ in what the union believes was an attempt to distract or otherwise keep the flight crew occupied. According to WTSP, a similar dry run occurred in August of 2001, just before the September 11 attacks. Actor James Woods complained to flight attendants of a commotion on the plane. It was later revealed that Egyptian 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta had shaken down Woods’ flight before takeoff and the men he complained about were some of the minds behind 9/11. The union memo mentions ‘several cases,’ and both US Airways and the TSA confirmed the disturbance aboard flight 1880. However, the TSA said the event warranted no further investigation. One anonymous Air Marshal disagreed. ‘They're liars. They're flat out liars,’ said the marshal, who insisted the flight 1880 incident has serious safety implications. ‘We're waiting for the next 911 to happen. It’s not a question of if, it’s a question of when.’ Wolf Koch concurred. ‘If a dry run's occurring,’ he said, ‘the attack is shortly following.’","'No question in my mind': Aviation Security Committee chairman and Delta pilot Wolf Koch fears plans for the next attack are already underway .

Black and bloated carcasses of cows lie rotting in their thousands in scenes more akin to an apocalyptic nightmare than the aftermath of a snowstorm. As many as 20,000 cattle are thought to have died where they stood last weekend as blizzards swept the South Dakota countryside leaving many ranchers' livelihoods in ruins. And today their corpses still scarred the picturesque flatlands to the west of the Roughrider State as the cleanup began. Scroll down for video . Dead where they stood: As many as 20,000 cattle are thought to have died where they stood last weekend as blizzards swept the South Dakota countryside leaving many ranchers' livelihoods in ruins . Scarred: Today their black and bloated corpses still scarred the picturesque flatlands to the west of the Roughrider State as the cleanup began . But with no federal livestock disaster programme in place, many ranchers were left wondering how they would survive the setback. 'This is the worse than I've ever seen for loss of livestock,' said rancher Karl Knutson, 25, who works on his family ranch east of the town of Sturgis, as he began counting his losses. 'Some people were very well prepared and lost 50 per cent of their herd,' said state veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven told CNN. 'Some were not prepared and took no losses. There was no rhyme or reason to it. Some ranchers lost everything.' 'It will be two weeks to a month before we have a better idea of the impact,' he added. Gary Cammack, who ranches on the prairie near Union Center about 40 miles northeast of the Black Hills, said he lost about 70 cows and some calves, about 15 percent of his herd. A calf would normally sell for $1,000, while a mature cow would bring $1,500 or more, he said. 'It’s bad. It’s really bad. I’m the eternal optimist and this is really bad,' Cammack, 60, said. 'The livestock loss is just catastrophic. ... It’s pretty unbelievable.' On top of the vast swathes of cattle killed in the blizzard, many also wandered off as powerful winds blew them far from their home pastures. Nightmare: A cow lies dead in the snow in scenes more like an apocalyptic nightmare than the aftermath of a blizzard . 'The worst I've ever seen': Josh Schumaker, 27, left, and Karl Knutson, 25, ride through pasture as they survey the damage to their herd . 'We have misplaced . cattle everywhere,' Oedekoven said. 'The storm blew them 10 miles or . more from where they are normally pastured.' Alan Rislov, 35, who ranches near Philip, said a disaster program would be welcome. He estimates he lost 30 percent of his cattle, but won't know until he finds all of them. 'We don't know for sure how many we lost, but in the hundreds,' he said. 'It's a tough deal,' Rislov said. 'We're hoping there's going to be a disaster program. We'll just have to see what happens, I guess.' Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said a previous federal livestock disaster program expired at the end of 2011. Lost cattle: Ranchers raced to find cattle that drifted beyond fenced pastures during the blizzard . October blizzard: This was the scene in Rapid City, South Dakota, as the storm dumped 33 inches of snow in South Dakota's Black Hills area last weekend . The House and Senate versions of the new farm bill include programs to help cover livestock losses, but the two chambers have been unable to agree on a farm bill after passing different versions several months ago. Until a new farm bill is passed, with a retroactive livestock disaster programme, little assistance is available to ranchers, Thune said. The House version of the farm bill would cover 75 percent of fair market value of lost livestock, while the Senate version would cover 65 percent. 'Hopefully, this will be the impetus to get the farm bill passed, to get people to the table,' Thune said.","The record-breaking storm dumped 4ft of snow in South Dakota this week .
