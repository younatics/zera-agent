"She's the first lady of fashion who worked as creative director of Smythson and often sits front row at the biggest shows, but it seems that Samantha Cameron has been taking style inspiration from her husband. Samantha, 43, was sporting a more androgynous style than usual as she and the Prime Minister  arrived in Birmingham ahead of the Conservative Party Conference. Wearing a pinstriped blue and white shirt, not dissimilar to the one her husband David was sporting, dark cord trousers and navy heels, the mother-of-three exuded an understated yet chic style. Scroll down for video . Trendsetter? Samantha Cameron is well-known in the industry for her sartorial wardrobe choices and as she arrived with husband David ahead of the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, she rocked an androgynous style . While fashion editors have quietly been championing mannish shirts for months, are we ready for cords to make a comeback from the 90s? Christopher Tennant, style writer at the Wall Street Journal, said: 'Banish all thoughts of preppy high-schoolers and '70s flares. Corduroy is cultivating a more refined air. 'Corduroy can be groovily retro or preppy and professorial. It has a reputation as a bit of a workaday fabric, but good, 100 per cent cotton corduroy is like velvet in its richness and is fantastic to work with.' It's a man's world: Crisp tailored shirts and trousers have been the fash-pack's wardrobe essentials so far this season and it seems that Mrs Cameron has taken note . Androgynous dressing is certainly the style de rigeur. The high street has witnessed sales of trouser suits soar by 157 per cent after recent awards ceremonies such as the Baftas and the Oscars, where fashion's finest were championing the trend. Style icons Cara Delevingne, Kourtney Kardashian, Madonna and Ellen Degeneres have been embracing the manly look since the start of the year and the red carpets were blanketed in ladies’ tuxes. Androgynous dressing is back on the style agenda but that doesn’t mean you have to look manly. 'Clean-lined suits with cuts in the right places can look feminine and flattering as shown at Jil Sander, Tods and Versace,' said fashion blogger Lydia Faye Jones. Although the look has been a celebrity favourite on the red carpet, it has crossed over into everyday wear with sales of plain black and navy trouser suits up by 157 per cent along with white shirts increasing by 105 per cent at Debenhams. Here they come: David and Samanta Cameron's outfit choices weren't too dissimilar as they arrivedat the  The Hyatt Hotel in Birmingham . Fashionista: Samantha often wins over style critics for her love of mixing high end designer, such as Roksanda Ilincic, Erdem and Phillip Lim - with high street options such as Zara and L.K. Bennett . Clearly Samantha, who quickly became  an ambassador for British style when husband David  was made Prime Minister in May 2010, is up-to-date with the trends (her sister does work for Vogue, after all). She often wins over style critics for her love of mixing  high end designer, such as Roksanda Ilincic, Erdem and Phillip Lim - with high street options such as Zara and L.K. Bennett. She also hosts a party at Downing Street every season to celebrate London fashion week, with this year's esteemed guests including Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss. The Prime Minister and his wife may have been all smiles on arrival last night, but David Cameron today vented his frustration at the chaotic start to his Tory party conference, overshadowed by the defection of a second MP to UKIP and a minister quitting in a sleaze scandal. Shaking up her style: Samantha is well known for mixing high street with high-end and chops and changes between a more masculine style, left, and feminine dresses, right . Frow: Samantha Cameron sitting on the front row at the Erdem SS13 show . Friends in high places: Natalie Massenet (C) MBE, Caroline Rush (R) CEO of BFC and Samantha Cameron (L), celebrate a year of British Fashion . The Prime Minister sought to focus voters' attention on the next election being a straight choice between him or Ed Miliband standing on the steps of Number 10, but admitted: 'It's not been the best start.' But he faces spending the week dogged by questions about how many more Conservatives will switch to UKIP in the coming days and weeks, in protest at his policies on Europe and immigration. The Tories have been plunged into crisis on the first day of their annual gathering in Birmingham. Mark Reckless yesterday stunned the Tory leadership by announcing he was joining UKIP, despite spending the last two weeks repeatedly denying he planned to do so. Bad start: David Cameron today vented his frustration at the chaotic start to his Tory party conference, overshadowed by the defection of a second MP to UKIP and a minister quitting in a sleaze scandal . And hours after UKIP leader Nigel Farage paraded his newest recruit, it emerged charities minister Brooks Newmark had been forced to quit over allegations he sent explicit photographs of himself to a woman - who was actually an undercover reporter. The married father-of-five today admitted he had been a 'complete fool' but pleaded for privacy for his family. Mr Cameron had hoped to focus attention on plans to curb benefits for the under-25s, but has been blown off course by events beyond his control . The Prime Minister today revealed his anger at the double blow to his party's image in a live TV interview. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr: 'I have to admit it has not been an ideal start.'","Samantha, 43, wore crisp pinstriped shirt and corduroy trousers .

"A Philadelphia mom introduced her 15-year-old daughter to heroin and continued to snort and inject with the girl over a six-month period, driving her to dangerous drug corners over 100 times to score a hit, police allege. Patricia Davenport, 35, was arrested and charged on Wednesday on multiple counts, including endangering the welfare of children and felony drug charges. The Lower Salford mother is accused of first giving her teenage daughter heroin in April, when they snorted it off the kitchen counter together in their Harleysville apartment. The girl then started injecting several times a week by summer, often in front of her eight-year-old brother, according to CBS Philly. Charged: Patricia Davenport, 35, was arrested Wednesday after allegedly introducing her 15-year-old daughter to the drug heroin and continuing to do it with the teenager for six months . Bad mom: Police allege Davenport went over 100 trips car trips to pick up drugs from dangerous parts of North Philadelphia with her two children and her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend . 'Incomprehensible': Police say at one point Patricia Davenport's eight-year-old son asked his mom about the syringe in her hand. She has been remanded in custody . Police say over the course of six months, Davenport drove her two children, as well as her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend, to North Philadelphia to make drug pick-ups. She would allegedly inject her daughter and the girl's boyfriend on the way home, police said. Her eight-year-old son was often in the car and at one point asked about the syringe in his mother's hand, police said. They made over 100 trips, CBS Philly reported. Officials have said the little boy was not given heroin. 'His life has been very deeply impacted,' Risa Vetri Ferman, Montgomery County's district attorney, told The Philadelphia Inquirer. Authorities credit one of the daughter's classmates with telling the school about her suspicions. The 15-year-old was sent to a guidance counselor, who inspected her and found track marks on her forearms, according to an arrest warrant. The school then called police. At a loss: Montgomery County's district attorney, Risa Vetri Ferman, said she can't believe a parent would ever be capable of the behavior allegedly displayed by Patricia Davenport . Davenport was arraigned on Wednesday, with a strong media contingent meeting her outside court. She has been remanded in Montgomery County prison on $50,000 bail. Her children were put in the care of family members by social services. Ferman said the disturbing case outlines the current heroin epidemic. 'I've been doing this long enough, so I don't get surprised a lot,' she said at a news conference, according to CBS Philly. 'But I'm really at a loss for words. 'It's incomprehensible to me that a parent would introduce her child to these drugs.'","Patricia Davenport, 35, of Lower Salford, Philadelphia, was arrested Wednesday on multiple charges .

"Raymond Knott, 62, got into a row with his son and daughter-in-law after turning up on their doorstep - but claimed his guide dog took him there (file photo) A blind man who harassed his family in a furious doorstep row over  inheritance blamed his guide dog for the argument, claiming the animal took him there by accident. Raymond Knott, 62, denied intending to go to his son and daughter-in-law's house in order to harass them over £102,000 of inheritance. He said he was completely surprised when he discovered where he was but 'took the opportunity' to knock on the door of the home in Somerset. The grandfather, who was wearing a T-shirt with 'Would you or would you not steal £102,000?' written on the front, then verbally abused daughter-in-law Rachael Knott. South Somerset Magistrates' Court heard that he accused her of swindling him out of the money, before demanding it back. When she asked him to leave he told her to 'scream away' before holding down the doorbell for around a minute. Courtney Daley, prosecuting, said: 'When she [Rachael] opened the door she found Knott standing there and they had a verbal argument where he said he wanted his money back. 'She asked him to leave but he stepped forward and said he was going to start on her parents and put them all over the papers. 'When she said she would scream if he did not leave he said ""scream away, I don't care"" and when she closed the door he put his finger on the bell continuously for about a minute.' Knott, of Castle Cary, Somerset pleaded guilty to pursuing a course of conduct amounting to the harassment of Rachael Knott. He was handed a restraining order prohibiting him from contacting his son and daughter-in-law directly or indirectly and from going to their address. The court heard Knott's father had died earlier this year, and left him £102,000 in his will. Concerned that he would lose his benefits if he took the money, Knott, who is registered blind, handed it to his grandchildren, the court was told. But in April he was reported to police by his son after he began harassing him, and his wife, in an attempt to gain access to the money. 'He later tried to renege on that agreement, but this was not possible and his son and daughter-in-law then started to receive abusive phone calls from Knott and he also started turning up at their house swearing and claiming they had stolen his money from him,' Miss Daley added. The trio attended a Restorative Justice meeting and a voluntary agreement was drawn up where Knott agreed to stop contacting them and not go to their address. But on July 1 Knott turned up at their home, and after discovering the house was empty, returned the next day. The court heard Knott claimed he had not intended to cause the victim harassment as he did not know he was at the address at the time - and said it was his guide dog's fault. Miss Daley said: 'He claims he told his dog to go to certain places but sometimes he just followed him. 'When asked about knocking on the door he said the dog took him there and he had not gone there intentionally.' South Somerset Magistrates' Court (pictured) heard that Knott was handed £102,000 of inheritance by his father, but fearful that he would lose his benefits if he took it, he gave it to his own son . Ryan Seneviratne, defending, said his client was registered blind and used a guide dog to assist him while he was out and about. 'He said that he left his house and unintentionally went to the address saying the dog took him there,' he said. 'However once he realised he was there that was the opportunity he had to walk away but instead he asked for his money back. 'He put the money into trust for his grandchildren with the sole reason that he could still claim his disability benefits but then decided he wanted it back to buy a property with. 'This was not seen as intentional harassment, however he should have known better as he signed up to the Restorative Justice agreement.' Alongside the restraining order magistrates gave Knott a 12-month conditional discharge ordered to pay £50 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Guide dogs generally rely on their owners to tell them where to go, and are simply there to stop the person from walking into objects or in front of cars, as they will automatically sit down at curbs. However, it has been known for guide dogs to learn particularly common routes, and dogs sometimes lead their owners to the wrong destination out of force of habit.","Blind Raymond Knott, 62, was given £102,000 inheritance by his father .

"It was the game banned in a sixth of British playgrounds - but one school has bucked the trend by encouraging pupils to collect as many conkers as possible. And some 400 pupils at Clifton Green Primary School in York, North Yorkshire, took part in the unusual harvest collection - bringing in a staggering 50,000 conkers over a ten-day period. Local business The Churchill Hotel had agreed to sponsor the collection for 10p per conker - albeit to a maximum of £250, while a Vauxhall dealer had also given £100. Bonkers for conkers: Charlie Staples, seven, with some of the 50,000 conkers collected by pupils at his school . Charlie and the conkers: Some 400 pupils at Clifton Green Primary School took part in the harvest collection . The venture ended up raising a total of £1,300, with all of it going to Martin House Children’s Hospice in nearby Boston Spa, West Yorkshire. Community outreach worker John Hattam said the school came up with the idea while making plans for its annual harvest celebration at Clifton Methodist Church in the city tomorrow. He added: ‘We decided to do something that all the children could do, that would get them out and about with their families and raise money for the hospice. ‘But we never expected them to collect so many. We have filled about ten 80-litre boxes. One family alone collected about 2,000 conkers.’ Impressive effort: The venture ended up raising a total of £1,300, with all of it going to a children's hospice . School employee Claire Neal said: ‘It’s a conservative guess that there are 50,000 conkers. 'All the conkers are in the school in boxes at the moment and it would take a long time to count each individual one. ‘We are hoping that somebody might buy them and we have offered the children to take them home. 'There has been a lot of talk that conkers help to keep spiders away from the house so some people might want a few to help with that. ‘The children have done it all in their own time and it has been a real family effort. That’s what we are all about at the school, family and community. Boxed up: The school came up with the idea while making plans for its harvest celebration. Charlie is pictured . ‘The idea is based on the harvest festival and all the children have loved it. Teachers have got involved with their families and all the money will go to Martin House children’s hospice.’ The Daily Mail reported in 2011 on a survey claiming traditional school games such as conkers and leapfrog were dying out because over-protective teachers had irrational fears about health and safety. Researchers found that conkers had been banned from nearly one sixth of playgrounds for fear that they could cause injury or trigger a nut allergy, even though they are not nuts. Clifton Green - which caters for 429 pupils aged from three to 11 - was rated in its latest Ofsted report in May as 'good', which was up from its previous rating in 2013 of 'requires improvement'.","400 pupils at Clifton Green Primary School in York took part in collection .

Lamay, who has an extensive criminal record, was taken into custody on a probation violation. Investigators in Palm Bay, Florida, will determine if the male nanny will face charges in the infant’s death. Scroll down for video .

Police responded to an apartment complex in Palm Bay at around 1am September 26 after getting a call about a child in distress,ClickOrlando reported. Baby Lorenzo was rushed to Health First Holmes Regional Medical Center, where he passed away a short time later. According to detectives, Lamay was babysitting Lorenzo, his girlfriend Chastity Cintron's son, and was the only person in the infant's presence after the child's biological father tucked him in at around 10.30pm. Sometime after midnight, Lamay called 911 saying that the baby in his care was not breathing after hitting his head in a fall from a couch, according to WESH-TV.

"The £11.99 champagne and £2.65 smoked Scottish salmon are flying off the shelves. Such bargain-priced delicacies have tempted so many new shoppers through Lidl’s doors that the discount supermarket has coined a name for them – Lidl-class. And a quarter of its customers are now middle or upper middle-class, joining families facing squeezed budgets in Lidl’s aisles. Bargain-priced delicacies have led to a wave of 'Lidl-class' shoppers - middle and upper middle-class customers - who are swayed by the likes of £11.99 champagne and £2.65 smoked salmon . ‘The public are changing their minds about us,’ Ronny Gottschlich, UK managing director of the German-owned firm, said in an interview carried in the Mail’s City pages today. He said the new Lidl-class shoppers have been wooed by ‘the introduction of our deluxe lines, the fresh lines and the Britishness of our business’. Sales rose by a fifth in the space of a year and will pass £4billion this year, the company will announce today as it unveils a £20million advertising campaign. Lidl has taken shoppers away from Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, according to specialist research firm Kantar. The Comte de Senneval champagne at £11.99 and smoked salmon at £2.65 for a 200g pack have helped, while Lidl has just launched a womenswear range including a biker jacket that isn’t real leather, but costs only £14.99 and has had glowing reviews. Lidl expects to have sold out of the entire first batch of women’s clothing, which only went on sale over the Bank Holiday weekend, by today. A men’s range is expected in November. The discounter wants eventually to more than double the number of its stores from 608 to almost 1,500 across the country. More than half of its produce is sourced from around the UK, and it estimates that £1.75billion of its sales are of British goods. Lidl now holds 3.6 per cent of the market, while fellow cut-price chain Aldi has 4.8 per cent. Kantar said 53 per cent of families have visited a Lidl or Aldi store in the past 12 weeks. In the past 12 months, Lidl’s share of the market has risen by 18.3 per cent, while Aldi’s has grown by 29.5 per cent, according to Kantar. Sales at Tesco fell by 4 per cent compared to a year earlier as Britain’s biggest supermarket continued to shed market share. Tesco’s hold on the market fell from 30.2 per cent to 28.2 per cent. Sainsbury’s share fell from 16.5 per cent to 16.4 per cent while Morrisons slipped from 11.3 per cent to 11 per cent. But Asda, which has introduced a ‘Price Lock’ on everyday items, increased its share. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital bank, said: ‘The Big Four retailers were taking their customers for granted through much of the economic downturn by depending upon inflation for sales and over-protecting margins. Unfortunately, the shoppers sussed their trading strategies out and went elsewhere.’ Kantar said a supermarket price war had pushed down food price inflation which now stands at 0.2 per cent, its lowest level since October 2006.","A quarter of customers at the supermarket are middle or upper middle-class .

"India captain Virat Kohli recovered from being hit on the helmet by the first ball he faced to underpin India's decent response to Australia's strong first-innings total in Adelaide. Kohli's impressive 184-ball innings of 115 on day three propelled the tourists to 369 for five at stumps after Australia declared on 517 for seven before the start of play. There was a heart-in-mouth moment when he first arrived at the crease though, with Mitchell Johnson's short-pitched delivery hitting him full-on in the helmet. India captain Virat Kohli celebrates as he reaches his century on day three of the first Test in Adelaide . Kohli is hit on the helmet by the first ball he faced from Australian paceman Mitchell Johnson . Johnson reacted immediately to check on the Indian skipper's welfare, as did several Australian players . Johnson (right) is offered words of encouragement by Australian captain Michael Clarke after the hit . With much of Australia still coming to terms with the death of Phillip Hughes from similar circumstances, there was genuine concern as the hosts surrounded the Indian skipper to check he was not hurt, while captain Michael Clarke comforted Johnson. But Kohli was fine and ensured his side have a fighting chance going into day four by building key partnerships of 81, 101 and 74 with Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane and Rohit Sharma respectively. With the sun shining once more after Wednesday's interruptions, Australia declared their innings before the start of play. In the third over of the day, Shikhar Dhawan, on one, survived a dropped chance when he got an inside edge off Johnson, although it was a tough one as Brad Haddin dived for the ball only to see it slip through his grasp. Kohli hits a shot on his way to a rousing century for India at the Adelaide Oval . Australian Ryan Harris takes a catch to dismiss India captain Kohli late in the day . Johnson (left) celebrates after taking the wicket of Kohli (right) on day three of the Test . Dhawan stuck around to help India score at a decent rate, but was nevertheless the first man out for 25, another inside edge off Ryan Harris needing no further assistance this time as it went straight on to his stumps. Murali Vijay had made a tentative start at the other end, but after taking eight off a loose over from Peter Siddle, he began to open up, and he ended the 20th over with a six and a four off consecutive balls from Nathan Lyon. He would hit Lyon for six again but soon after reaching his half-century he fell victim to Johnson, playing at a delivery which swung away from him and helping it into the gloves of Haddin to go for 53. That brought Kohli to the middle and before he could set about a fine afternoon's work there was the tense moment of Johnson's delivery hitting his helmet as he ducked late. Once Kohli was given chance to settle, he and Pujara got to work before Lyon broke their third-wicket stand with a good delivery which caused Pujara to hesitate before a tentative prod merely helped it through on to the stumps. A general view shows the number 408 that was painted on the ground as a tribute to Phillip Hughes . Michael Warner (left) dives for the ball after India's Cheteshwar Pujara plays a stroke . A view of the Adelaide Oval as India supporters wave their flags after a boundary was hit . Cricket fans sit in front of the scoreboard at the Adelaide Oval as they watch the action on day three . Lyon continued to put India under pressure, in particular asking lots of questions of the new man in Rahane, who was subject to one big shout for lbw - replays showed an inside edge - and then offered a half-chance to short leg, with the ball just falling short. From the first ball after tea, Kohli brought up his first Test fifty in 11 innings, a great way to show how he is handling the extra responsibility of captaining the side for the first time. At the other end, Rahane was nearing a half-century of his own, but still offering chances. A big pull shot from a Siddle bouncer went high but Lyon, racing in from the boundary, could not stretch for the catch and instead it ran for four. Rahane would make it past 50, but with the new ball looming, Lyon stepped up his attack. Australia claimed the catch when David Warner twisted acrobatically at short leg, but the ball had come off the pad. But from the next delivery, Rahane gloved it to the slips where Shane Watson hung on to remove him for 62. With Sharma in at the other end, Kohli brought up his century in style by punishing Mitchell Marsh's poor delivery to claim his 12th and final four of the day over the mid-wicket boundary. They kept India ticking over before Johnson made the key breakthrough for the hosts in the 95th over, taking Kohli's wicket with a bouncer that the India captain could only send into the palms of Ryan Harris at deep fine leg. Stumps came two overs later with Sharma, unbeaten on 33, and Wriddhiman Saha, one not out, at the crease with India trailing by 148 runs.","India captain Virat Kohli scored 115 on day three of the first Test .

"Chauffeur David Matthew was awarded £600 after refusing to pay the extra charges brought by Virgin Mobile . A man has been awarded £600 by a phone company which wrongly charged him for sending text messages which were 'too long'. David Matthew, 44, was baffled when he started being billed for picture messages by his provider Virgin Mobile. The chauffeur from Durrington, West Sussex, - who depends on texting his clients to inform them of price changes - refused to pay the bills but had his service cut by the company, causing him to lose business. Virgin Mobile charged Mr Matthew 40p every time he sent a text message longer than 160 characters, claiming they were picture messages despite the man's unlimited texts tariff. 'I refused to pay the bills because I shouldn’t have been charged,' he said. 'I was getting charged for sending picture messages, but I never sent them. 'Virgin then cut my phone off and I lost custom. 'I’m a chauffeur. I often text all my clients letting them know pricing changes, which can be quite lengthy texts. After filing a complaint, a judge at Worthing County Court ruled in Mr Matthews' favour, adding that he should have been allowed to send long text messages. Virgin Mobile were ordered to pay him £610, which included £90 in loss of earnings compensation. 'Finally this is all over, hopefully I can get on with recovering my business,' the chauffeur added. Scroll down for videos . A Virgin Media spokeswoman blamed David’s phone for the blunder. She said: 'There is no limit to the number of text messages on our unlimited tariffs. '160 characters is the universal standard length for text messages, yet some handsets automatically convert much longer texts into multimedia messages. 'This was explained to Mr Matthew on several occasions and goodwill gestures given, but we’re sorry he felt this was not explained to him when he took out his contract.' Mr Matthew has since left Virgin Mobile. Last month a father was hit with a £1,792 bill after his 10-year-old daughter downloaded 28 hours of videos on how to make loom bands. Trinity Groves watched hundreds of the tutorials over two weeks on her Nokia phone after the family's home Wi-Fi stopped working, racking up a huge bill for her father . Trinity's father, Philip, said he was stunned to see he had been charged £1,411. He then phoned Vodafone to contest the amount and cancel his contract but was dealt a double blow when they slapped an extra £381 cancellation fee on top . Trinity Groves watched hundreds of the tutorials over two weeks on her Nokia phone after the family's home Wi-Fi stopped working . But her father, Philip, 35, was unaware his daughter had instead been using Vodafone's premium rates for the internet in order to access YouTube videos. Trinity said: 'I used to love watching the tutorial videos but now I know it cost my dad £1,792 I have had to stop watching them - it's made me very sad.' Also in October, a woman was handed a £12,500 bill after accidentally using her phone to download repeats of sitcom My Family while on holiday in Turkey. Patricia Al, 23, from Chelsea, London, was hit with the huge bill after downloading just two episodes of the BBC comedy on her O2 phone.

"The trainers of Sire De Grugy and Sprinter Sacre have both issued positive reports on their absent stars ahead of the 888sport Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown.

Speaking at Sandown, where he won the Winter Novices’ Hurdle with Vyta Du Roc and juvenile hurdle with Bivouac, Henderson could not conceal his frustration at suggestions that Sprinter Sacre will never fully recover from the fibrillating heart issue which caused him to be pulled up in the Desert Orchid Chase at Kempton’s 2013 Christmas meeting. The Lambourn trainer said: ‘He was really good this morning but no-one will believe me. He and Bobs Worth went a mile and a half and I was delighted with both of them. ‘Most people think he doesn’t exist so I just do it own my own to amuse myself.’ Asked if the Desert Orchid Chase remained a possible comeback option, Henderson added: ‘Everything is a possibility but there is no rush.’ Nicky Henderson said Sprinter Sacre had successfully worked with Bobs Worth on Friday . Sire De Grugy was ruled out for the rest of the year after scans last month revealed a hip problem. Moore said: ‘He will start being ridden again on Monday for 10 days. We then re-scan and, hopefully, progress from there.’ Paul Nicholls-trained Saphir Du Rheu is 8-1 (JLT Chase) and 12-1 (RSA Chase) with Coral after a first chase success at Exeter.

"A mother-of-one says she is 'devastated' as a new roundabout has permanently blocked access to her new £20,000 driveway. Ksenia Martin says she knew about the £150 million project to widen the A453 outside her home in Clifton, Nottinghamshire, but says she did not realise that the planned roundabout would block her drive permanently. Retired Mrs Martin, who spent £20,000 landscaping and re-paving her garden and driveway, says she has been left devastated by the news. Ksenia Martin (pictured) says she did not know the £150million project would permanently block off her drive . The £150 million roundabout blocks Mrs Martin's brand new driveway - she now has to park around the corner . Mrs Martin has repeatedly tried to sell the house but says she has found no buyers because of the development of the roundabout just yards from her front door. She says she was not aware of the plans before she bought the house, and says the solicitor did not flag them up to her. She says she would never have bought the house  - or spent the money renovating the driveway if she had known. She said: 'I'm devastated - I've spent a lot of money on the driveway, having it re-paved and also having six-foot gates put up. 'There was a leaflet shoved through the door telling me I wouldn't be able to park on my drive because of the building works. 'I got in touch with the number on the leaflet to see how long the road would be shut for and was told I wouldn't be able to use my driveway again.' Mrs Martin's drive (house pictured before the roadworks began) is unusable following the development . The Highways Agency says it has provided a small parking area which Mrs Martin has a permit to use but it is 200 yards away from her front door. As a result, the retired housing scheme manager says she feels isolated and vulnerable. Mrs Martin said: 'Since the work started nobody comes to visit me - family and friends just can't get near the house without a permit. 'Because I can't carry more than two or three bags from the car to the house I'm having to do three trips to the shops instead of one. 'What I'm most concerned about though is if I fall ill or there's a fire. 'An ambulance or fire engine couldn't get close enough to the house and I'd have to be dragged through the street.' Even once the roadworks are completed, the entrance to her house will not be accessible and she will have to continue parking around the corner. Her home is part of a two-house mini cul-de-sac and the entrance will be permanently closed from now on. Mrs Martin, who bought the house for  £107,000 in June 2011, put her home up for sale in April to try and get away. Four days after advertising her home for £130,000 it sold, but because of the development of the roundabout the sale fell through and she has been unable to find a buyer since. She said: 'I've had another eight viewings but once they took one look at the roadworks they turned round. Mrs Martin has tried putting her house up for sale, but says the roundabout and roadworks puts buyers off . 'I was just wasting my time, so I gave up. I would move house tomorrow if I could.' Mrs Martin says she has not received any compensation. Daughter Lisa Eden, 36, who lives further down Farnborough Road, said: 'It's very frustrating. The 36-year-old said: 'I don't live that far away but if I'm on my way back from somewhere in the car, I can't just pop into my mum's. 'It's also been very upsetting for me to see how distressed my mum has been. 'She feels very isolated and she definitely doesn't get as many visitors anymore.' A spokesman for the Highways Agency said: 'The Highways Agency sympathises with Mrs Martin's predicament. We have worked with her to try and find a potential solution. 'We've explored the possibility, with Nottingham City Council, of whether a new access to the driveway could be provided from the side of the house but this was not possible. Mrs Martin spent £20,000 landscaping and re-paving her garden and driveway - but will not be able to use them . 'A car park for residents has been provided next to Mrs Martin's house, which she now uses. 'As with any scheme, it is standard practice for the Highways Agency to engage with stakeholders on plans and carry out a thorough public consultation before plans are finalised. 'Plans were in place when Mrs Martin purchased the property and local searches and plans indicated the impact the A453 scheme would have had on the property.'","Ksenia Martin was 'devastated' to discover she will not be able to use drive .

"Emily Otrando, 10,  of Rhode Island died last week . The 10-year-old girl who died from complications of an unusual respiratory virus that has been affecting children across the U.S. has been named as Emily Otrando of Rhode Island. The state Health Department said Wednesday the girl from Cumberland died last week of a staph infection associated with enterovirus 68, which it called 'a very rare combination.' It's unclear what role the virus played in the death, Health Director Michael Fine said. Fine said she was taken to Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence when her parents noticed she was having trouble breathing and called 911. He said the situation quickly 'became dire' and Emily died within 24 hours of arriving at the hospital. He said she did not have any previous infections or an underlying disease. Cumberland Schools Superintendent Philip Thornton said in an email to the school community Wednesday that school leaders were 'misinformed' by the Health Department when they told last week in 'straight and clear terms' that their student did not have the enterovirus. Health Department spokeswoman Christina Batastini said health officials would not have told the school that because they did not have the test results until this week. She was remembered in a family obituary as a sweet child who loved animals and Harry Potter. She wanted to grow her hair long to look like her favorite Harry Potter character, Luna Lovegood. Emily attended Community School and was a Girl Scout, according to the obituary. The state Health Department said Wednesday Emily (seen right and left) from Cumberland, died last week of a staph infection associated with enterovirus 68, which it called 'a very rare combination' She loved to write stories and go to the beach with her family. She had a dog, Lola, and a fish, Rainbeau, but she always asked for a new pet on trips to the pet store with Grammy. 'Emily was a sweet, loving, beautiful child who found joy in life and nature,' the obituary said. It is currently unclear what role the virus played in Emily's death, Health Director Michael Fine said Wednesday . Emily was taken to Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence when her parents noticed she was having trouble breathing and called 911. She died within 24 hours of arriving at the hospital . The virus was also found in three other patients who died in September, according to theU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC declined to release any other details about those deaths. Enterovirus D68 is one of more than 100 non-polio enteroviruses, a group of viruses that cause 10 million to 15 million infections in the United States each year. The government says enterovirus 68 has sickened at least 500 people in 42 states and the District of Columbia. Sweeping the nation: The CDC has been testing a limited number of specimens from very sick children around the country, and as of Thursday reported 277 people in 40 states and the District of Columbia with enterovirus 68 . In Colorado U.S. health officials are investigating at least 10 cases of children who developed limb weakness or paralysis after testing positive for the respiratory virus. EARLY SYMPTOMS: . The virus beings like the common cold and may include sneezing, a runny nose and a cough. This is all that happens for most people who catch an enterovirus, especially adults. Children, especially with asthma, are more susceptible to catching a more severe form of the illness. At the beginning it's almost impossible to tell the difference between enterovirus 68 and a common cold. If a child develops a rash, a fever, or has difficulty breathing, parents should seek medical attention as soon as possible. Dr. Larry Wolk, chief medical officer of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said some of the children have been ruled out for Enterovirus D68 infection and others are awaiting test results. All of those experiencing limb weakness have recently been diagnosed with either some form of enterovirus or rhinovirus, two large classes of common viruses that cause respiratory infections. The common cold, for example, is caused by a rhinovirus. 'Just because it's not specific for D68 doesn't mean it's not another, similar virus,' Wolk said. 'There is a very high number of kids who have viral respiratory illness this time of year,' he said, adding that limb paralysis is 'a rare complication of all of these viruses.' The CDC is investigating the cases and asking other states whether they are also are seeing higher than normal cases of limb weakness associated with a respiratory virus infections, according to its website. 'It's obviously not just D68 in and of itself,' Wolk said. 'The question is, is there something else that ties these 10 cases together.' All of the children in the Colorado cluster are under 21, and most live in the Denver area. Of those involved, six have been discharged from the hospital. Nine of the 10 were treated at Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of all 10 cases show lesions in the spinal column. Symptoms range from weakness in arms or legs to total paralysis of a limb, Wolk said. The CDC said it is focusing its testing efforts on cases in which people develop severe respiratory illness, although it is likely that many more people with milder symptoms are infected with the virus. Bed ridden: 13-year-old Will Cornejo is recovering at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children at Presbyterian/St. Luke's Medical Center in Denver earlier this month from what doctors suspect is enterovirus 68 .

"A man accused of killing the mother of his five-year-old son while on the run from the fatal drive-by shooting of a six-year-old girl has been found guilty of first degree murder.

Michael Lawrence, from Michigan, is one of four suspects accused of killing six-year-old Lay'la Jones, in Saginaw, in August 2012 . Angelica Olivarez was strangled outside her home in April 2013. The murder was witness by her then three-year-old son, MIchael who testified at the trial . After he was charged for Lay'la Jones' murder, Lawrence went on the run from police.

'It's very gratifying to get the result that we were looking for,' said county Prosecutor John McColgan Jr. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to Angelica's loved ones.' Lawrence was on the run from the Jones case, and then also the Olivarez case, for almost exactly a year before police arrested him in Las Vegas in August 2013. 'We were hoping he would plead to save the family from going through this,' McColgan said. 'But he didn't, so we did what we had to do.' Olivarez's mother, Theresa Medel, said she was 'glad it's over' and that 'it came out the way I wanted it to come out.' 'I'm glad he's going where he belongs,' she said. Michael D.

"Amir Khan has conceded that the spectre of Floyd Mayweather will never be far from his mind when he steps in the ring for his welterweight showdown with Devon Alexander in Las Vegas in the early hours of Sunday morning. Khan has spent the majority of the pre-fight build-up insisting he is only concerned with the immediate threat posed by the former IBF champion and that there remain plenty of other options in the 147lbs division. But the 28-year-old Bolton native betrayed his true concerns when questioned over his ability to see off Alexander in explosive enough style to make the prospect of a future showdown with the self-styled 'Pretty Boy' a reality. Amir Khan and Devon Alexander square up to each other during their final pre-fight press conference . Khan said: 'I want the boxing fans around the world to demand a fight between me and Floyd - I want them to demand it when they see Amir Khan in such a good fight. 'They're going to be like, 'wow, he should fight Mayweather'. I don't just want it to happen, I want people demanding it. It's going to be a tough fight but I don't just want to win it, I want to win it in style.' Time will determine the extent of the mistake Khan made a year ago when he pulled out of a prospective showdown with the then IBF champion in the mistaken belief he had already landed a dream Mayweather bout. Khan has spent the majority of the pre-fight build-up insisting he is only concerned with Alexander . Instead Mayweather chose to face former Khan foe Marcos Maidana, leaving Khan out in the cold, and he spent a 14-month absence from the ring before returning to outpoint Luis Collazo in May. The prize for beating Alexander could be huge, and Khan insists his work with trainer Virgil Hunter has helped blend his natural inclination to attack with a more measured approach that should serve him well. 'I'm still going to be the fighter that I've always been but I'm just going to be smarter,"" added Khan. 'When I put an attack together there has got to be a reason for it. 'You can be exciting and come forward and throw a lot of punches, but be careful at the same time. That's what Virgil has brought to the table - he has made me a fighter who understands everything I have to do in the ring."" Khan has conceded that the spectre of Floyd Mayweather Jr (above) will never be far from his mind . Despite Khan's workmanlike win over Collazo there remain questions over his ability to cope at the higher weight, having previously flapped to an unconvincing points win over an ageing Julio Diaz in Sheffield in April 2013. Alexander lost his title to fellow American Shawn Porter a year ago but also has much to prove despite a good enough comeback win over Jesus Soto Karass in June. Alexander echoed Khan's sentiments when he said: 'I definitely need to win and I want to look good doing it. 'I think a lot of people are going to be looking at this fight and saying, 'this is the future of the welterweights'. I've got to pull out all the stops for this fight and go out there and just be me.'","Amir Khan praises trainer Virgil Hunter for improving his all-round game .

"The MGM Grand is home to master magician David Copperfield and Amir Khan is under no illusion that it is he who will be disappearing from this mecca of boxing if Devon Alexander beats him here on Saturday. In the final hours before his first bill-topping performance at this fabled arena, the English Muslim who would be king of the prize-ring acknowledged: ‘If I don’t win this one I’ll never get the chance of a shot at Floyd Mayweather.’ Worse still, he would not know what to do with life after next week’s delayed celebrations of his 28th birthday . Amir Khan admits a dream fight against Floyd Mayweather won't happen if he loses to Devon Alexander . Khan (left) will fight Alexander (right) for the WBC welterweight Silver title on Saturday in Las Vegas . ‘The loser,’ he says, ‘will have nowhere to go.’ Well, in his case back to Bolton and a domestic dust-up with Kell Brook - maybe, reluctantly - but no return to this glittering Strip in the Nevada desert. He says: ‘Neither me nor Alexander can afford to lose if we want to go on to super-fights against Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao.’ The word on the Strip is that a Khan victory over Alexander – like himself, a former two-time world champion – will hoist Khan to the top of Mayweather’s hit list for a multi-million dollar rendezvous in the spring. Not that anything is ever certain when Mr Money comes to choosing his opponents, as Khan discovered to his cost a year ago. Khan could fight Mayweather (pictured) in May next year if he overcomes Alexander at the MGM Grand . AMIR KHAN . Age: 28 . Born: Bolton, England . Nickname: King . Stance: Orthodox . Height: 5ft 9in . Reach: 71in . Fights: 32 . Wins (KO) 29 (19): . Losses (KO): 3 (2) DEVON ALEXANDER . Age: 27 . Born: Saint Louis, USA . Nickname: The Great . Stance: Southpaw . Height: 5ft 9in . Reach: 70in . Fights: 28 . Wins (KO): 26 (14) Losses (KO): 2 (0) On the promise of a Mayweather fight last May, Khan was encouraged to pull out of the December 2013 date originally set for this fight with Alexander. Had he gone through with that and won, he not Brook would be a world-welterweight champion today. But then Alexander lost that title to Shawn Porter, who was subsequently relieved of the belt by Brook. Now, even though the intervening 12 months have enabled him to grow into this star-spangled division from light-welter, Khan regrets that decision. He says: ‘I’ve learned a lot of things this past year and one of them is to go with the flow when opportunity knocks, not sit around waiting for something that may not happen.’ Yet the boxing world works in mysterious ways. If anything, they are playing for even higher stakes in Casinoville this weekend. If Mayweather wishes to avoid facing the most menacing threat to his cherished unbeaten record – namely Manny Pacquiao – he needs a credible alternative opponent in the first half of next year. Alexander, who has two career losses to Khan’s three, says: ‘Once you get to the elite level a defeat always sets you back badly. But with so much at stake right now, this is definitely not the moment to lose.’ With than in mind, a measure of risk elimination has been applied by both trainers. Khan (right) has been urged by his trainer Virgil Hunter to keep calm during the bout against Alexander . Virgil Hunter is urging calm on Khan, warning him to temper his fighting instinct until he is absolutely certain he has Alexander primed for a stoppage. Khan says: ‘I think I’m always exciting to watch but this will be a chess match before the fireworks display. Devon is top class and I will box him as well as fight him.’ Alexander says: ‘Amir will not be the only fast man in this ring. But if he is a bit quicker than me then he will find that timing always trumps speed in the end.’ Given the high skill sets of both men the Grand Garden Arena could be putting on an evening for the boxing connoisseur, illuminated by bursts of explosive action. Khan accepts that he needs not only to win but to do so in impressive style if he is to nail down Mayweather and he says: ‘I’m primed to make a statement to the world that I’m ready for the mega-fights.’ Alexander (right) is confident his speed and timing will prove to strong for Khan on Saturday . Perhaps the danger he must beware most is Alexander being driven to over-achieve by emotional reaction to the civil unrest in his home city of St Louis. He hails from quite close to the neighbourhood of Ferguson, where protests about the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white policeman are ongoing and have been taken up in other cities across America. His trainer, Kevin Cunningham, was born and bred in Ferguson and the pair of them ‘want a victory to take back to our town and bring a little happiness to our people.’ Cunningham has been unwell this week and there is some concern whether he will be able to take his place in the corner. If not, what Alexander loses in advice and encouragement may be more than compensated for by a motivating desire to win for his boxing father figure. Khan believes his move up to from light-welterweight to welterweight has given him extra punching power . Both protagonists believe they can win by knock-out. Khan talks of his additional punching power generated by the extra poundage he has put on while becoming a full welterweight: ‘I’m hitting much harder now.’ Alexander subscribes to the popular theory of weakness in the Khan jaw: ‘If you’ re unlucky enough to be born with a suspect chin there’s not much you can do about it. When you get hit, you go down.’ However, with chess-board strategy likely to check-mate the pyrotechnics, I expect Khan to box his way to a victory on points. *Khan v Alexander will be televised live on Sky Sports late this Saturday night.","Amir Khan fights Devon Alexander at welterweight on Saturday .

"Manchester City showed their eagle-eyed ambition on Wednesday night by progressing to the last 16 of the Champions League and Manuel Pellegrini's side were all smiles as they trained in Rome on Thursday ahead of their flight back to England. Goals from Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta saw the Premier League champions seal a 2-0 win away at Roma - a result that saw them qualify as Group E runners-up at the expense of their opponents. The importance of the Stadio Olimpico scoreline means City will now enter the knockout stages of the Europe's elite competition for only the second time in their history; a feat that they were clearly proud of as they trained at Lazio's Formello facilities - the base of Roma's arch-rivals.

'We don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but the more seasons we play in the Champions League, and the more games we play in it, the experience helps and we get better as a team.'","Manchester City won 2-0 at Roma in the Champions League on Wednesday .

"Amid the post-match excitement of Wednesday night’s stunning Champions League victory in Rome, Samir Nasri suggested Manchester City are now among the best teams in the world. In Moscow and even in Rome itself, there will be many who disagree. Certainly this year’s Champions League has seen the very worst of Manuel Pellegrini’s team at times. When they have been bad, they have been horrid. In four games against CSKA Moscow and Roma, for example, they won once. Big results can turn seasons, though, and, for perhaps the first time under Pellegrini, City now have a very big European result behind them. Samir Nasri scored in the second half at the Stadio Olimpico as  City secured their place in the last 16 . Nasri fired in from long range in the 60th minute  as City secured a crucial 2-0 victory to advance into the last 16 . The 2-0 victory in the Stadio Olimpico not only completed a remarkable back-from-the-brink story that began with Sergio Aguero’s two late goals against Bayern Munich in their penultimate group game, it will have given them a little of the self-belief that can carry teams an awful long way in knockout competitions. ‘I’ll be biased, of course, but for me we have one of the best teams in the world,’ said Nasri, scorer of City’s first goal on Wednesday. ‘We just have to show it now. ‘I think, when you go through, with all the difficulties we had, it’s a miracle. We had only two points after four games. ‘But we did it and we can go as far as possible. We just have to be lucky in the draw.’ As Nasri spoke, team-mate David Silva stood nearby and expressed his own wish that City avoid the big Spanish teams in the draw for the last 16 of the competition. Pablo Zabaleta added a late second for Manchester City as they moved into the knockout stages . ‘I prefer anyone else,’ said Silva. ‘I don’t want any one of them. The later you play a Spanish team, the better, no? ‘They’re all so good that, if you get one, you may as well get one of the others. It would be a difficult draw. But every team that gets through now, they’re difficult. ‘No matter who we get we have to be 100 per cent and have to get a little luck too.’ Silva’s candour was interesting and it’s hard to disagree with the rationale. City, on the evidence of the season so far, would appear to be some way behind the likes of champions Real Madrid and Barcelona, who knocked them out last year. Pellegrini’s team remain fundamentally hard to judge. As modest as they have been at times this season, they showed a resilience not always associated with them against Roma and we saw performances from central defender Eliaquim Mangala and midfielder Fernando to suggest they may finally be growing into life at their new club. David Silva is keen on avoiding a Spanish side in the next round of the Champions League . Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure were among the players missing for City against Roma . With injured players to come back at various stages over the coming weeks, there is much to suggest that City will get better. But can they realistically expect to compete with Europe’s best and overhaul Chelsea at the top of the Barclays Premier League? ‘I just think you want too much from us,’ said Nasri, peculiarly. ‘Like you said, if you qualify for the next stage of this, and you are just three points behind Chelsea, when a week ago everyone was comparing them to the Invincibles from Arsenal, everyone saying they were unbeatable and stuff like that, then it means we are not that bad. ‘The thing is last season we were smashing every team 6-1, 6-0, 5-0, but everyone has studied all the teams, it’s not the same any more. ‘And you have a couple of injured players and a couple of key players who are not at their best so, you know, we just show that as a team we can perform.’ ‘I think it was really important to perform without three or four of our main players. ‘Any other team would struggle so it was important. We have made a lot of progress in the past few weeks. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini smiles after a job well done for his team at the Stadio Olimpico . ‘It’s been three weeks where we have performed really well, like we did at this time last year. It’s maybe a coincidence that it was at the same period last year that we produced our best results. ‘But it was important to perform, it was important to go through, because of the ambition of the squad and the club. We did it as a team, that’s the most important thing.’ City now have six wins from six games. Performances recently against teams such as Southampton and Sunderland in the Premier League have been convincing and a visit to Leicester offers further opportunity to bolster new-found belief. Certainly they will miss Aguero, while it will be interesting to see if Gary Neville’s suggestion that Yaya Toure may struggle to find a way back into the team is borne out. It would be surprising if it is. What is perhaps more important is that City now have a statement European result behind them. Every team — every manager — needs one. From here, anything can happen. Asked how good City can be, Nasri was circumspect. ‘I don’t know,’ he said. ‘When we are able to have all of these players available, we will see how good we are.’ City keeper Joe Hart is hoping his team can finally reach their potential after four seasons in Europe .","Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta goals secured a place in the last 16 of the Champions League for Manchester City .

"Taking inspiration from the fear of Ebola, a Dallas-area man has been sickening his neighbors with stacked up barrels marked 'biohazard,' surrounded his yard with yellow caution tape and crossed his door and windows with white tape marked 'quarantine.' 'There's negative people everywhere and they are going to give me grief about it but it's all in good fun,' James Faulk told reporters on Wednesday while standing outside his home wearing a face shield and white protective suit with the label 'CDC Trainee' and  gripping a clipboard and red plastic bag marked 'biohazard infectious waste.' The decorations re-enact a scene that's played out at three Dallas apartments following the first diagnosis in the U.S. of Ebola. Too soon?: Homeowner James Faulk poses in front of an Ebola-themed Halloween display he made at his townhome in the University Park section of Dallas . After the diagnosis of Thomas Eric Duncan, who traveled here from West Africa, biohazard crews descended on the apartment where he was staying. Following his Oct. 8 death, two of his nurses were also diagnosed with the virus and the cleanup scene was repeated at their homes. Faulk, who lives in a town house in the wealthy enclave of University Park, started putting up the decorations Sunday. He said he thought that by then ""it was getting back to normal just a little bit."" 'So the next step is: Let's have fun on Halloween and scare some people in the process,' said Faulk, who on Wednesday added a banner reading 'Happy Halloween.' The two nurses remain hospitalized and hundreds of Texans, including those who cared for the Ebola patients and who were on the same flights as one of the nurses, are still being monitored. Ebola or treat!:  According to Faulk, he is just trying to get people to smile and enjoy Halloween and says Ebola is a prevalent and extremely scary topic . Real or fake?: When James Faulk's neighbors first saw his decorations they thought the home might really be under quarantine because Ebola is a current problem in Dallas . 'It could be too soon,' Faulk conceded. 'It's a scary thing.' Jill Grover, whose children attend the high school across the street from Faulk's house, said she initially thought it might have been a real scene until she noticed no workers were around. 'It is Halloween, but it is scary because the Ebola was happening in Dallas,' said Grover, who said she wasn't offended but could see how others would be. 'I think this is funny but I bet the family of Nina Pham doesn't,' a neighbor told Fox. University Park spokesman Steve Mace said police so far have gotten just one call out the house and an officer drove by to check out the situation. He said no laws were being broken. 'I just love Halloween. When I first heard about Ebola I was scared. I hope people can get a laugh out of it,' Faulk told Fox. Faulk says he plans on adding more displays during the week like a hospital bed with a dummy.

"Ally McCoist has refused to comment on whether he offered to resign as Rangers manager but did say he was '100 per cent committed' to the club. The 52-year-old has come under pressure from supporters in recent weeks, with the Glasgow giants trailing Hearts by nine points in the race to win promotion to the Scottish Premiership, and various reports on Friday suggested he had tendered his resignation. Ally McCoist took charge of Rangers for their match at Queen of the South on Friday . However McCoist took charge of the Light Blues for their Scottish Championship match at Queen of the South. The club have refused to comment on the story and speaking to BT Sport before the game in Dumfries, McCoist was more interested in talking about the match. 'I am completely focused on the game and I can't comment on anything else,' he told BT Sport. 'You'd need to task the club about all that. Rangers chief executive Charles Green (top row centre) talks to Ally McCoist before the match . 'I've no idea if this will be my last game. I certainly hope not. 'I've no plan to talk to the board and there's nothing on my mind other than picking up three points. 'I can assure (the fans) I am 100 per cent committed on getting them back to the top.' And despite the hefty points difference between themselves and Hearts, McCoist believes his side can still go up to the Premiership as champions. Rangers Manager Ally McCoist (right) was the centre of attention at Queen of the South . '(I) absolutely believe it (we can catch Hearts),' he added. 'I watched their game last week, we firmly believe we have to put pressure on Hearts, no easy job that is for sure.' McCoist was a real Ibrox favourite as a player, scoring 355 goals in all and was part of the Rangers team which won nine league titles in a row in the 1980s and 1990s. However, McCoist's tenure as boss since taking over from Walter Smith in 2011 has been far from plain sailing. Supporters' criticism of his tactics and signings have increased this season in the wake of some poor performances and results. Aside from defeats to Championship rivals Hearts and Hibernian, the Gers have failed to beat Alloa in three attempts, with the recent 3-2 Challenge Cup defeat to the Wasps - after blowing a two-goal lead - bringing McCoist's managerial abilities under even more intense scrutiny. In addition to general disgruntlement at Rangers' performances and style of play, the seemingly-endless battle for power at the cash-strapped club over the past few years has left many fans disillusioned and that has led to falling attendances at Ibrox.","Ally McCoist refused to comment on whether he offered to resign .

"A flat tire may be the least of a driver's problems. Nissan is recalling more than 220,000 Nissan Altimas because a latch defect could cause the hood to fly open while the car is being driven. The recall only applies to 2013 models of the vehicle, but CBS Philly reports that Nissan is investigating whether other models with similar designs may be involved. Nissan told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that the recall affects vehicles manufactured from March 6, 2012, to February 28, 2013. Recall:Nissan is recalling more than 220,000 Nissan Altimas because a latch defect could cause the hood to fly open while the car is being driven . Top: Nissan Altimas are Nissan's top selling vehicle in the U.S. Nissan officials said that the issue has to do with an interference between the hood inner panel and the secondary latch. A NHTSA recall stated that the panel and latch, combined with debris and corrosion, could result in the secondary hood latch remaining in the unlatched position when the hood is closed. The statement went on to say that if the primary latch is accidentally released when the secondary latch is already in the unlatched position, the hood of the car could fly open and possibly result in an accident. Nissan spokesman Steve Yaeger told the Associated Press that the defect was first discovered when there were reports of a small number of hoods flying open and damaging the cars. However, no injuries have been reported. Yaeger also said that as long as Nissan Altima owners don't release the main hood latch when they're driving, there shouldn't be a problem. To remedy the situation, Nissan is recalling 220,423 of Nissan's top-U.S. selling vehicle and will have dealers modify the car's hood actuation lever and have the latch joint cleaned and lubricated if necessary, according to the NHTSA. Owners may have the latch system replaced if severely damaged. All repairs are free of charge. The company has not yet provided a notification schedule to owners. The AP reports that the more than 220,000 vehicles include 219,000 Nissan Altimas in the U.S., 10,049 in Canada, 5,267 in Mexico, 2,042 in South Korea, and a small number in Guam, Saipan, and Latin America.

"Shares in Domino’s Pizza have hit an all-time high this week to complete a remarkable turnaround some five years after the delivery company suffered a major public relations crisis when footage of employees playing with the food surfaced. In April 2009 a prank video was posted on YouTube showing an employee violating health-code standards by putting cheese up his nose and sneezing over food. The video was watched by more than a million disgusted viewers and Domino’s faced a serious credibility crisis as customers stayed away and its share price suffered. Shares in Domino’s Pizza have hit an all-time high this week to complete a remarkable turnaround some five years after the fast food company suffered a major public relations crisis when footage of employees playing with the food surfaced . The incident forced the company to make big changes and now five years on the company is bucking the trend among other fast food giants – including McDonalds and rival Pizza Hut owner Yum! Brands - and is gaining customers and expanding its business. The 10,000-plus-unit global pizza delivery chain has undertaken major overhauls of its menu, recipes, use of technology and, most recently, look and feel. 'We've done a lot of transformation of our brand. We expanded our menu with things like stuffed cheesy bread and sandwiches, and in 2010 we even transformed our core pizza,' said Brandon Solano, vice president of store development at the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based chain. Profits are up 16 percent according to Domino's latest earnings report and the company added 160 stores in the last quarter alone, reports CNN Money. Domino's introduced breaded chicken bites loaded with pizza toppings, including cheese and bacon, in April . Since announcing its impressive third quarter figures earlier this month, shares in Domino's have skyrocketed 13 percent and on Wednesday hit an all-time high for the pizza company - a long way from the doldrums after an embarrassing YouTube video leaked in 2009 . Since announcing its impressive third quarter figures earlier this month, shares have skyrocketed 13 percent and on Wednesday hit an all-time high. Domino’s is enticing consumers with low-cost offers such as two pizzas for $5.99 each, while innovations such as the launch of breaded chicken bites loaded with pizza toppings, including cheese and bacon, in April have also helped. Restaurants have also been refitted as 'pizza theaters' which let customers see how their food is prepared and provide a more welcoming experience than was previously on offer. Technology has also played a key role. In June Domino's launched a 'Siri-style' voice ordering app, which had taken over 200,000 orders by the end of September. Domino's 'pizza theater' concept lets customers see how their food is prepared and provides a more welcoming restaurant experience than was previously on offer . The emphasis on technological innovation helped Domino's generate approximately 40 percent of U.S. sales from  digital channels in 2013, as well as reach an estimated $3 billion annually in global sales. The U.S.'s big four chains - Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's and Little Caesars - together have little more than 40 percent of the market at present and analysts predict these innovations could help Domino's continue to grow. Founded in 1960, Domino's has a significant business in carryout pizza, but also has more than 11,250 stores in over 75 international markets. In 2013, Domino's had global retail sales of over $8.0 billion - comprised of nearly $3.8 billion in the U.S. and over $4.2 billion internationally.

"Former N-Dubz singer Dappy leaves Guildford Crown Court today after he avoided jail despite assaulting a man while serving a suspended prison sentence . Former N-Dubz singer Dappy has been spared jailed and walked free from court despite assaulting a man in a nightclub while serving a suspended prison sentence. The 27-year-old prayed and thanked the judge as his sentence was read out and he learned that instead of prison, he would be subject to a curfew with an electronic tag. The rapper, who was tried under his real name Costadinos Contostavlos, was found guilty in September of punching a football coach on the dancefloor of the Evissa nightclub in Reading, Berkshire. Judge Neil Stewart told the sentencing hearing at Guildford Crown Court that he would give the troubled star a chance, taking his responsibilities to his two children and his remorse into account. He decided not to activate his suspended jail sentence when sentencing him for the nightclub assault. Instead the judge handed him a two-month jail term, suspended for 12 months, a four-month curfew with an electronic tag keeping him at home between the hours of 10pm and 5am and ordered him to pay a fine and compensation. The singer was in court today for breaching a six-month suspended jail term by getting into a dancefloor brawl over a girl which left the coach with a bleeding nose. The judge told the star: 'You have a thread of violence throughout, not at the high level, but it continues. 'You plainly have a temper. No doubt you have attracted unwelcome attention on a number of occasions and that takes a toll. 'That doesn't justify the sort of reaction characterised by these offences.' The star, dressed in black trousers, a white shirt and black jumper with brown Louis Vuitton trainers and a red poppy, had his hands in a prayer position as he sat in the dock awaiting his sentence. He had arrived with a large holdall ready for a custodial sentence and looked desperate, with his head in his hands, as the prosecution ran through guidelines for sentencing. Waving at his friends and supporters in the court, he mouthed ‘See ya,’ - before he discovered he would walk free. The court heard that the start of Dappy’s trial was delayed at the beginning of the year because he was in the Celebrity Big Brother house. Scroll down for video . The rapper was flanked by minders as he walked free. He instead was made the subject of a curfew with an electronic tag . Jon Harrison, defending, said the rapper was struggling financially, having put his house up for sale to pay large tax debts he had run up. Mr Harrison said Dappy had 'underlying issues' and wanted to 'address the root cause of his bad reactions to other people,' and would welcome having a curfew with an electronic tag to keep him out of clubs. The singer has been seeing a psychiatrist, the court heard, who said the death of Dappy’s father had had a big impact on him. Dappy was found guilty in September of punching football coach Devonn Reid at the club in a fight over a girl. Outside the court Dappy told reporters that it felt amazing after he escaped jail and said it was the start of a 'brand new me' A district judge sitting at Reading Magistrates’ Court previously heard that a fight broke out on the dancefloor of Evissa nightclub last October because Dappy, from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, began chatting to a man’s girlfriend and female friend. Mr Reid was out celebrating his 21st birthday at the club in Reading, when he asked the rapper to stop talking to the women. He said that the star 'popped my nose.' Dappy denied the attack, claiming he had felt threatened by a 'group of six or seven big boys' at the bar and said he’d been pulled away by a bouncer before a punch was thrown. Earlier in the day, Dappy arrived at Guildford Crown Court dressed in black trousers, a white shirt and black jumper with brown Louis Vuitton trainers and a red poppy . Sentencing for the nightclub attack was adjourned at Reading Magistrates’ Court last month when District Judge Davinder Lachhar decided the matter should be dealt with at Guildford Crown Court. She said this was because his latest conviction put him in breach of a six-month suspended sentence handed down for a previous affray and assault, which could now be activated. His six-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months was for affray and assault at a petrol station in Guildford, Surrey, in February 2012. Dappy spat at two teenagers, Grace Cochran and Serena Burton, both aged 19, leading to a fight in which three men were seriously injured. The rapper was caught on CCTV slapping a man in a nightclub in Chelmsford in Essex earlier this year . The rapper and the Celebrity Big Brother star was fined £800 for the attack . The rapper and Celebrity Big Brother star was also fined £800 earlier this year for slapping a man at a nightclub in Chelmsford, Essex. Leaving court today and flanked by his minders, Dappy told waiting reporters: 'I feel amazing. It’s a brand new me.' As part of his sentence the rapper must take part in the Thinking Skills Programme for offenders. The group programme helps people work on their self-control and problem-solving skills in order to curb negative behaviour.","Rapper prayed and thanked the judge after he avoided being jailed .

"Disloyal: Former Pakistani Taliban spokesman Shahidullah Shahid, who has been sacked after apparently pledging allegiance to Islamic State . The Pakistani Taliban have sacked their spokesman after he apparently released an audio message saying he and other commanders had defected to Islamic State. Taliban leadership said Shahidullah Shahid no longer worked for them and reiterated their support for and allegiance to Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar. 'As far as allegiance to ISIS is concerned, (Taliban leader) Amir Mullah Fazlullah has clarified that our allegiance is to Mullah Mohammad Omar Mujahid,' they said in a statement. Shahid's sacking followed the release last week of an audio message purportedly recorded by him pledging allegiance to Islamic State. The authenticity of the recording, which was posted online, could not be verified and nor could Shahid be contacted, Reuters said. The Taliban leadership said Shahidullah Shahid was a nom de guerre and the spokesman's real name was Sheikh Maqbool. It did not name his successor. One Taliban commander told Reuters Shahidullah's pledge of allegiance to IS was a move to seek publicity. 'He used our name and tried to make it big news in the media,' the commander said. The Pakistani Taliban have been deeply divided for years, with dozens of smaller groups jostling for influence, although members say divisions are exaggerated by authorities to discredit the group. The powerful Mehsud tribe has virtually refused to accept the authority of the group's new leader, Mullah Fazlullah, Reuters reports. He came to power last year after his predecessor was killed in a U.S. drone strike in the remote mountains on the Afghan border. Moreover, militants from the Mohmand region have split from the main Taliban movement and formed a separate group called Jamaat-ul-Ahrar. There is little evidence of direct contacts between militants in Pakistan's tribal areas and Islamic State leaders, although the Middle Eastern group's radical rhetoric is likely to have captured the imagination of many fighters. There are many fundamental differences between the Taliban and IS, and al-Qaeda-linked commanders are believed to be wary of Islamic State's inroads into South and Central Asia. Shahid, centre, speaking to journalists at an undisclosed location near the Pakistan-Afghan border in February: His sacking followed the release of an message purportedly recorded by him pledging allegiance to IS . Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan and Pakistan want to topple governments and set up a Sharia state based on Islamic law, while IS, which controls swathes of land in Iraq and Syria, wants to create a global caliphate. Yet activists sympathetic to IS have been recently spotted in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, distributing leaflets praising IS, and Islamic State flags have sprung up at street rallies in Indian-administered Kashmir. As it seeks to expand its mission globally, IS is likely to be keen to set up base in South and Central Asia, a region rife with anti-Western ideology and full of unemployed men ready to take up arms to fight for their beliefs.","Taliban leadership said Shahidullah Shahid no longer worked for them .

"A teenage girl helped her big sister to give birth at a  rest spot on the I-95  when the baby decided that she couldn't wait for them to get to the hospital. Kennedy Smith, 14, and her sister Kelsea Marcus, 21, were being driven to Christiana Hospital in Newark by their mom on Sunday. But they soon realized that the baby was not going to wait until they got to the hospital as they drove down the busy road near Delaware.

Special delivery: Mom Kelsea holds her newborn baby in the front seat of a car as emergency workers arrive . Stunning: This beautiful little baby Karter Zoe Marcus, was delivered by her aunt Kennedy Smith on Sunday . ‘Everyone was going crazy, so someone had to stay calm and keep everything together,’ Kennedy told Fox 29. Kennedy said she was sitting in the back seat of the car supporting Marcus who was sitting in the front seat and calming their mother down as she drove them at top speed to the hospital. As Smith entered the northbound I-95 from Del. 896, Marcus told her that she was trying not to push, 'but had to.' Kennedy said: ‘Ten minutes after my sister's water broke, the baby came.’ Kennedy called 911 and her mother pulled over into the Delaware Welcome Center on I-95. By that time, the baby was fully delivered with Kennedy's help. The 911 operators instructed Kennedy how to tie off the baby's umbilical cord and wipe the baby's mouth area. Safe hands: Kennedy Smith, 14, is an honor student and helped to deliver the baby, she has plans to enter the medical field and will study  at the University of Pennsylvania next summer . They also instructed her to go six inches down and tie off the umbilical cord. She said that if she hadn't been wearing shoelaces she was prepared to use the string from her hooded sweatshirt instead. The beautiful baby girl was born weighing a healthy seven pounds, one ounce. She was welcomed into the world with kisses and cuddles from her aunt, mom, and great- grandmother. Soon, New Castle paramedics arrived on the scene and assessed both the baby and her mother. They were then transported to the hospital. The baby had been due on September 20 but was not born. Marcus was scheduled to be induced at 9 p.m. on Sunday. But the baby clearly had other plans. Meanwhile, Kennedy, an honor student, says she plans to become a doctor. This summer, she studied at Southern Methodist University in Dallas and is scheduled to study next summer at the University of Pennsylvania. She told Fox 29: 'I'm in a STEM program so I'm training to be a physician. And this gives me more experience I guess so I think I'd actually consider going into medical field and delivering babies.' Her proud mother added: ‘We don't know what we would have done if Kennedy wasn't in the car keeping us calm. It was scary.’","Mom-to-be Kelsea Marcus, 21, was on her way to hospital to give birth .

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Neil Ashton and Charles Sale on Scotland 1-3 England . Wayne Rooney and Roy Hodgson depart Glasgow Airport on Tuesday night after England's fine win . Rooney's double means he is three goals behind Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time England record . Rooney celebrates his first goal with Chris Smalling, Danny Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . The great Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who has played 101 times for his country and scored 51, is idolised and cherished by the good folk of Sweden. Zlatan, unlike Rooney, has previously refused to play for Sweden over a disciplinary issue and also retired, briefly, from international football in October 2009. It did him no harm. Rooney’s record of 46 goals in 101 international appearances is similar to the Swedish forward and yet our country remains divided about his contribution to the English game. His performance in Scotland, where he scored twice in a 3-1 victory over Gordon Strachan’s team at Celtic Park, was masterful. There is a maturity about his game. At 29, with the captain’s armband strapped to his left bicep, he has taken it upon himself to draw the best out of England’s emerging young players. Rooney nods in the first of his double against Scotland to move into third on England's all-time scorers chart . The England captain sweeps in his second of the night and his side's third to seal victory . ‘Sometimes results don’t go the way we want them to and people see it as if we don’t want to play four the country, but that’s far from the truth,’ he claimed. ‘We love coming to Scotland, we love playing for England. You have seen what it means to us and we are like that in every game.’ Rooney has had his moments, but if we are to make comparisons then Ibrahimovc has a rap sheet, all documented in his brilliant autobiography I Am Zlatan, that puts the England forward to shame. Ibrahimovic is no angel. He has never scored a goal at a World Cup, either, but Ibrahimovic’s acolytes always gloss over that because Sweden is Sweden, right? Rooney operates under different pressures with England and his detractors will always reference his disappointing record (one goal, in a 2-1 defeat against Uruguay in Sao Paulo at the 2014 World Cup) on the biggest stage of all. Rooney runs away in celebration as he prepares to launch himself into a cartwheel . The forward cannot hide his delight as he wheels away in front of the travelling England support . Rooney became England's youngest ever player when coming on in a 3-1 loss to Australia in 2003 . If bringing home the Golden Boot from a World Cup really is the be-all-and-end-all about a player’s place in the game’s Hall of Fame, then we are duty bound to look back at the last few tournaments. Since Rooney was born in Croxteth in 1985 there is only one striker in the game who has won as many league titles as Rooney during his career. That man was Hristo Stoichkov with Barcelona (5). Whether or not you like Rooney, respect him or otherwise, there are few Golden Boot winners who have done it consistently for club and country since they made their international debuts. The much-admired Gary Lineker, who scored six times during England’s run to the World Cup quarter-final at Mexico 86, never won a league title. After scoring 48 times for England, he enjoys legendary status. Rooney acknowledges the crowd before England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia, his 100th cap . Rooney is edging closer to the England record of Charlton (left), here scoring against Portugal in 1966 . At Italia 90 we fell in love with the Italian forward Toto Schillachi. He scored five at the tournament but never won a league title. Russian forward Oleg Salenko, who scored six at the 1994 World Cup in the USA, won a league title with Dinamo Kiev. Davor Suker, leading scorer at the 1998 World Cup, won one league title with Real Madrid. The Brazilian Ronaldo, who scored eight in 2002, won just one league title in Europe, with Real Madrid. Miroslav Klose, who scored five for Germany at the 2006 World Cup, won two league titles with Bayern Munich. Injury permitting, Rooney is on course to beat Peter Shilton's 125-cap record for England . Rooney's career has not always been simple, but he has five Premier League titles with Manchester United . Salvatore ‘Toto’ Schillaci was top scorer at Italia 90, yet he never won a title . Thomas Muller, top scorer in South Africa, has three DFB titles with Bayern Munich and will win countless more. James Rodriguez (Brazil 2014) won three league titles with Porto. Some of the other issues, judging by the consistent reaction to Rooney on social media, is that the forward happens to play his club football with Manchester United. It is there that Rooney has scored 219 goals in 450 appearances for since joining United just weeks after he announced himself to international football at Euro 2004. Gary Lineker nets the second of his three goals against Poland - he was top scorer at the 1986 World Cup . Hristo Stoichkov (left) joined Oleg Salenko, who hit five goals against Cameroon, as top scorer in 1994 . Davor Suker scores one of his six goals in the 1998 World Cup during the semi-final against France . He is third on the list of all-time leading scorers, just 18 behind Denis Law and 30 short of equalling Sir Bobby Charlton. ‘I can’t speak for him but if you ask me the records should be very important,’ claimed Hodgson after England had recorded their sixth successive victory in Scotland. ‘It must be nice for him to think he’ll see his name at the top of the list and a record number of caps is in sight too.’ After more than ten years at the top for club and country, it is time Rooney is given the credit he deserves. Germany legend Miroslav Klose is the top World Cup goalscorer ever with 16 goals . Before the tournament in Brazil, Ronaldo was the World Cup's top scorer - he hit 62 goals in total for Brazil . Rooney scored his one and only World Cup goal in the 2-1 defeat by Uruguay in Sao Paulo in the summer .

"These are the breathtaking bird's eye view shots a paraglider took as he soared in the skies above the Lake District. Stuart Holmes, 48, has spent the past three years with his head in the clouds and his camera ready to take beautiful aerial shots of the well trodden landscape. The photographer, who learnt to paraglide in the Alps in 1987, used a Canon 5D to take more than 360 photographs at 70 locations in The Lakes. Stuart, who lives in Keswick, Cumbria, said: 'Right from the start, I realised the huge potential for taking unusual landscape images from this privileged viewpoint normally restricted to the birds. Dramatic: Stuart took this flying above Wasdale Screes and Wastwater, which he described as 'always a treat. In late November the contrast between the russet coloured bracken, the dry dead fell grass and green fields is most dramatic' An unusual view of the north-western Lake District with Keswick and Derwentwater made up of a series of vertical shots stitched together to create the panorama. 'The light was problematic as I was looking directly into the sun and there were deep shadows,' added Stuart . Incredible: The view of Kirk Fell, Great Gable and the Sca Fells. Stuart said: 'Occasionally you are rewarded with amazing flying when you just don't expect it. I walked up Pillar intending to have a quick fly down at sunset. The wind was just enough to keep me airborne then a small thermal took me high above the ridge giving me this incredible view. Not bad for late February' 'A paraglider is typically only flying at around 20mph which gives you a good amount of control and time to compose shots. 'The downside is you are at the mercy of the wind and air currents as well as your own ability to use those air currents to stay up and move around.' He claims his love of paragliding has helped boost his love of photography. 'It takes me to places people don't usually see, it is a truly amazing way of experiencing The Lakes,' he said. 'A lot of people take a camera with them when they go flying but not everybody takes a high quality camera and can take the time to get into position to take a decent picture.' Using mainly wide angles, Stuart was able to capture beautiful panoramic shots without compromise. Stuart says he flew in special conditions above the Lorton Valley with Grassmoor in front and Crummock Water below to capture this picture where his feet make an appearance. 'The cloud was forming below us and we had to be careful where we flew so as not to lose sight of the ground,' he said . Captured during an evening flight with a friend on Scafell Pike. Stuart said: 'The sun was shining through gaps in the cloud just before sunset, painting the crags and scree in a golden light, a magical time of the day to be up here' But Stuart says no matter how spectacular a scene, he sometimes refrains from letting go off the controls to take up his camera for safety reasons. 'Carrying and operating a bulky and heavy SLR in the air is not ideal when trying to maintain control of the wing; not hitting anything is a priority and essential to my health and continued enjoyment of life,' he said. 'Occasionally the air is too rough and no matter how spectacular the scene around, I dare not release the controls to take up my camera for fear of losing control.' Stuart captured this while looking down to the Mary Mount and Lodore Hotels with the Derwent River flowing out into Derwentwater . Bird's eye view: Stuart says he created a special harness and uses a remote control to trigger the shutter to capture self-portraits including this one over Calf Close Bay, Derwentwater, near Keswick . Ultimate selfie: Paraglider pilot Stuart took this on warm summer evening flying above Walla Crag and Derwentwater. 'A fast shutter speed is required here to freeze the movement. A bit of background blur indicates I was spinning quite fast,' he said . And Stuart has even managed a few 'selfies' using a specially made harness and a remote control to trigger the shutter. He said: 'I have experimented with self portraits whilst flying, the view from up high in the wing looking straight down with the glider lines leading the eye straight to the pilot is very effective, especially when combined with a spectacular backdrop. 'I have rigged up an extra line in my wing that I attach my camera to in a specially made harness. This line goes up from me to a pulley near the top of my glider and then back down to me. 'During stable flight I can pull on one end and hoist the camera up towards the canopy itself. To stop the camera swinging wildly about I have two short lines with clips attached to the camera strap lugs that act like side lines which I clip onto glider lines to run up and down. Stuart Holmes, pictured, first learnt to paraglide in the Alps in 1987. 'Right from the start, I realised the huge potential for taking unusual landscape images from this privileged viewpoint normally restricted to the birds,' he said . 'I use a remote control to trigger the shutter.' For 20 years, Stuart worked as an exploration geologist, traveling to remote locations around the globe. It allowed him to go climbing, paragliding and exploring armed with a camera. Since starting his company FotoVUE with friend and rock climber Michael Ryan, Stuart has amassed a vertigo-inducing collection of shots of the region. He has spent three years photographing and writing a book called Photographing the Lake District, the first book in a series of ten. The other nine will cover different parts of the UK. Stuart said: 'I have been paragliding over 20 years and took photos from the air in all that time. 'There are no aerial shots in the book. 'The book is designed for anyone with an interest in the Lake District to direct them to some of the most beautiful places and help them take amazing photographs.' Beautiful: From around 4500ft, Stuart managed to take this over Blea Water and Haweswater. Stuart said: 'These days are relatively rare when the air is so clear and conditions for paragliding are optimal' Looking down onto Sprinkling Tarn with Great End above it and Scafell Pike beyond from around 4500ft. Stuart said: 'After taking off from the side of Catbells I used thermal currents to get high and bob along to fly over the highest peaks of the central fells' Fleetwith Pike and part of Honister slate mines looking down Honister Valley towards Buttermere. 'Sometimes it's nice to get closer to the landscape with a longer lens or selective cropping,' said Stuart . Abstract: A fellow glider is seen over this jagged path up Blease Fell on Blencantha. Stuart said: 'By cropping tightly to remove all distractions and reference to location the path up Blease Fell on Blencathra is turned into an abstract' Long shadows can be seen towards the end of the day at Castlerigg Stone Circle above Keswick. 'I landed in the centre of the circle just as a coach load of tourists arrived, it's not often you get a round of applause on landing,' said Stuart . Flying above his home patch of the Keswick valley, Stuart said: 'Sometimes from up high the air is so clear you can see Snowdonia in Wales, the Mourne Mountains of Ireland and Scotland just 25 miles to the north' A tiny paraglider can be seen in the top left hand of this image over Derwentwater, Skiddaw and Blencathra. 'April in the Lakes is the start of the good flying season with strong thermals and longer hours of daylight. I took off from Threlkeld Knotts which is the hill at bottom right' Grassmoor and Crummock Water with Buttermere off to the left and Loweswater on the right. 'This was one of those days where you could almost fly anywhere in the Lakes. I spent 4 hours in the air photographing around the Buttermere Valley, I was absolutely buzzing with the experience when I got down,' said Stuart . Vertigo: Looking down to Helvellyn and Thirlmere from around 5000ft. 'One of my best flights in the Lakes, we took off from above Swindale near Haweswater and I flew back home to Keswick high over the mountains' The red sandstone cliffs of St Bees Head, the most westerly point of both Cumbria and Northern England. 'Coastal flying is quite different to inland flying, the air off the sea is usually very smooth without a ripple to disturb you. This makes photography much less stressful not having to worry about your glider so much' said Stuart .","Stuart Holmes, 48, from Keswick, Cumbria, has spent two years taking aerial shots of the well trodden landscape .

"A judge reversed course Monday and dismissed a defamation lawsuit by Donald Sterling's mistress against the estranged wife of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner. Judge Richard Fruin issued a tentative ruling last week saying he planned to allow the suit, but he reconsidered after arguments from Shelly Sterling's lawyer. It is unusual for a judge to reverse a tentative ruling. The judge found V. Stiviano presented no evidence to support her claim that Shelly Sterling called her a thief and an embezzler in hundreds if not thousands of media reports. He said she did not present a single quotation to support her claim. A judge Monday dismissed a defamation lawsuit by Donald Sterling's mistress V. Stiviano against the estranged wife of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, Shelly . 'Stiviano does not identify to whom any such statement was made,' Fruin wrote. 'There is no information from which it may be determined that any statement, defamatory or not, was made by Mrs. Sterling at all.' The judge also rejected Stiviano's claim that former Clippers President Andy Roeser also defamed her at the instruction of Shelly Sterling. He said there was no evidence of that. Attorney Pierce O'Donnell, who persuaded the judge to dismiss the case, said Stiviano's cross-complaint was an 'act of sheer desperation.' Shelly Sterling is suing Stiviano for the return of $2.5 million in gifts from her husband. 'Shelly is pleased that this patently frivolous defamation action has been dismissed with prejudice,' meaning it cannot be filed again, O'Donnell said. 'Act of desperation': Stiviano was suing in response to Shelly Sterling's lawsuit, which seeks the return of gifts that include a $1.8 million duplex, a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover worth more than $500,000 . He added Stiviano has no defense to Shelly Sterling's lawsuit because the items Stiviano received from Donald Sterling were community property, and he had no right to give them away. 'We look forward to our March 9th trial before a Los Angeles jury where Shelly is confident that she will be prevail.' Shelly Sterling's lawsuit seeks the return of gifts that include a $1.8 million duplex, a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover worth more than $500,000. An assistant in the office of Stiviano's attorney, Mac Nehoray said he was not taking media calls. Stivianio and the Sterlings made news last spring. She was the woman whom Donald Sterling was talking to in a recorded conversation when he made racist remarks that got him banned from the NBA and his team and fined $2.5 million. Shelly Sterling was put in charge of selling the Clippers and made a record-setting deal with former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who bought the team for $2 billion.","Shelly Sterling is suing Stiviano for the return of millions of dollars in gifts .

"Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock admits the club must make 'two or three' signings in January to boost their chances of Barclays Premier League survival. Palace have won just once in nine games ahead of a crucial Christmas period that includes matches against Manchester City, Southampton and fellow strugglers QPR. Only two points currently separate the Eagles from the bottom three and Warnock believes it will be essential to strengthen the squad when the transfer window opens. Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock admits he must bring in 'two or three' players during January . 'We've got to bring players in,"" said Warnock, whose side host Stoke on Saturday. 'Without knocking our players, they've got to be better than we've already got and it takes quite a lot of money to do that. 'We've got some good players so it's just trying to add two or three players to the squad that we've got to give us that bit more in depth. 'The substitutes' bench hasn't had a lot of players on it for me to change a game so that's something for the second half of the season, where we can look to influence the game by the substitutes.' Yannick Bolasie (left) shoots at goal under pressure from Aston Villa defender Aly Cissokho at Selhurst Park . Palace have struggled for goals in recent games, scoring just once in their last three league outings. Yannick Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha both impressed during a goalless draw at Tottenham last weekend but the Eagles lack enough cutting edge in the final third to snatch victory. 'I think we've known all along that we haven't got that clinical striker,' Warnock said. 'I think we've scored quite a few goals over the season but they just seem to be in spurts. When we score, we score three. 'We've got to start putting lesser chances away that would have earned us quite a lot more points.' Defensive midfielder Mile Jedinak is the club's top scorer in the league this term with five goals, three of which came from the penalty spot. Wilfried Zaha (left) impressed in the recent goalless draw at Tottenham but the Eagles still lack a cutting edge . Marouane Chamakh, Dwight Gayle and Fraizer Campbell have all struggled for form while experienced frontman Andrew Johnson has been sidelined with injuries. Johnson's contract runs out in January and Warnock admits it will be a difficult decision whether to keep the 33-year-old. 'If he can get back to fitness he can do a job in the Premier League but it's a big question mark in the space of three weeks how fit he's going to be able to get,"" Warnock said. 'He's been unlucky, he's hurt his calf for the last few weeks and I'd just told him he was going to be on the bench for the Liverpool game and he pulled up in training, it's a blow to him. Defensive midfielder Mile Jedinak (left) is the club's top scorer in the league this term with five goals . 'He's got a problem with his knee now - he was seeing someone this week and I'll know more about his problem later.' Warnock added: 'He's fabulous around the place. It's good when they care and helping out with the youngsters. 'Unfortunately we all get older, you get these problems and you can't shake them off.'","Crystal Palace have won three games in the Premier League this season .

"Sebastian Coe claims athletics' reputation is being disproportionately damaged by doping cases involving a small number of countries and has promised that the investigation into allegations of systematic doping in Russia will be completely independent. A programme by German ARD-TV has alleged that doping and corruption extended beyond Russia and implicated the sport's world governing body the IAAF in covering up the problem. The French sports daily L'Equipe has also raised questions about meetings in Moscow hotels in 2011 between Valentin Balakhnichev, the president of the Russian athletics federation and an IAAF council member, a legal adviser to the IAAF named Habib Cisse and Massata Papa Diack - the son of Lamine Diack, president of the IAAF. Sebastian Coe believes athletics' reputation is damaged by doping case involving a small number of countries . Lord Coe, an IAAF vice-president, insisted Lamine Diack was fully behind the investigation but admitted the latest allegations made it a difficult time for athletics. Speaking at the IOC session in Monaco, Coe said: 'You have to say that the scope and scale of these allegations takes it beyond simply a competitor deciding to step beyond the moral boundary. 'This is not in every country of the world - there are 213 federations. But you do have to say a disproportionate amount of the reputational damage is in a relatively small number of countries, and I think we have to recognise this. 'They are very serious allegations. The very fact that the allegations are in the public domain means that they are serious. So, we have to be very clear that this is a very, very difficult time for our sport.' Coe, who is standing in next August's election to succeed Diack as president, said the latest transcripts of the programme have now been sent to the IAAF Council, the body's ethics committee, to the IOC and the World Anti-Doping Agency. Coe unveils his IAAF presidential campaign manifesto, at the British Olympic Association in London . Asked if the allegations against Diack's son made it difficult for the IAAF president, Coe added: 'No I think Lamine is very clear, he will wait for the investigation and if names are in the fray then those names will be subject to that investigation. 'He's certainly not curtailing the work of the ethics committee nor could you - it's Michael Beloff, one of the top QCs in the world.' Coe indicated he would be in favour of publishing the ethics committee's investigation, and confirmed that IAAF rules would allow Russia to be declared non-compliant if the allegations are judged to be proved. He added: 'We do have a category, a status which we refer to as in good standing. A good standing is not just about paying your subs on time or being free from political interference. We have had suspensions in federations for all sorts of reasons because, for one reason or another, the council have decided that that federation is not in good standing. Let's just see where these reports take us.'","Sebastian Coe claims doping cases in a small number of countries is damaging the reputation of Athletics .

"QPR have announced they will not be taking disciplinary action against Steven Caulker over the incident that left the defender requiring hospital treatment. Caulker suffered a cut to his head amid reports he was involved in a brawl at a London pub on Sunday afternoon with players from Crystal Palace also present at the social event. QPR say Caulker, who is available for Monday night's Barclays Premier League trip to Everton, was wounded after falling over and have opted against punishing the 22-year-old.

Rio Ferdinand and QPR's top scorer Charlie Austin pose for a photo as Eduardo Vargas pulls a face (centre) on Sunday afternoon as the Hoops squad celebrated Saturday's victory over Burnley . The incident is said to have occurred at the Ship Inn, in Wandsworth, London . Manager Harry Redknapp insists the bid for top flight survival remains intact despite the incident that occurred just hours after the club had moved out of the relegation zone with a second victory in three matches. 'A few of the players went out for Sunday lunch, it was only a small group. I didn't stop them going, they were quite entitled to do that,' Redknapp said. 'I've always said I've got no time for footballers going out and having a jolly over Christmas because it's a busy time of year. 'But they went for Sunday lunch, it wasn't a Christmas party.

He fell over somehow and got a cut on his head but is OK now. 'Has it damaged anything? No, it certainly hasn't damaged anything. It was only one lad who ended up having a problem, fell over and banged his head. The rest of them.....not a problem . 'I certainly didn't think it warranted front page headlines.

'Robbie's an amazing footballer, one of the best professionals I've come across. He's gone over there and been the best player in the league, he hasn't gone there for a holiday,' Redknapp said. 'But he belongs to the LA Galaxy and is the star man of their team and league. We've never made an enquiry about him. They wouldn't let him go. 'I've never spoken to Jermain.

"Wimbledon’s Crazy Gang are furious about a new television documentary they claim has depicted them as brutal thugs. The club’s former owner Sam Hammam has complained to BT Sport and demanded they make alterations to their programme The Crazy Gang, which is due to air on Boxing Day and charts their remarkable rise from non-League football to winning the FA Cup at Wembley in 11 years. In it, Vinnie Jones describes a horrific attack by John Fashanu on a team-mate at the club’s training ground, while Fashanu himself is on camera appearing to glory in intimidation and violence around the club, saying at one stage: ‘We ruled by fear. Wonderful.’ Wimbledon’s ex-owner Sam Hammam (centre) has complained to BT Sport and demanded they alter it . BT Sport's documentary The Crazy Gang is due to air on Boxing Day and charts their remarkable rise . Hammam attended the film’s premiere in London on Thursday night with former managers Dave Bassett and Bobby Gould and ex-players Terry Gibson, John Scales, Terry Phelan, Dave Beasant and Andy Thorn — all of whom were interviewed for the programme — and was outraged at what he sees as a lack of balance. ‘Wimbledon was a group of people who worked hard and fought against heavy odds for 20 years and came up trumps,’ said Hammam, who flew from Lebanon to attend the screening. ‘We represented the little person, the working-class fan who doesn’t have a lot but works hard and doesn’t give up. ‘Everyone at the club I have spoken to was appalled at the way the programme made us look.’ Hammam and Bassett were seething that Fashanu was given more airtime than anyone else and gave the impression the team’s core ethics were threats and bullying. Hamman said: ‘The programme portrayed the group as violent thugs as if that was all they had to them. The suggestion was that the players were just a bunch of Fash’s boys and they were all terrified of him. It was far, far from the truth. Vinnie Jones (left) describes a horrific attack by John Fashanu on a team-mate at the club’s training ground . Jones was among those seen as the hard men of Wimbledon's squad that rose to the top of football . ‘It wasn’t the Fash show. We had some very good players. Dennis Wise, Dave Beasant and John Scales played for England, Lawrie Sanchez went on to manage Northern Ireland.’ Bassett felt his time as manager between 1981 and 1987 when they shot up the leagues to reach the First Division was undervalued and the sense of fun and camaraderie had not been properly represented. In the no-holds barred documentary, Jones, who now plays tough guys as an actor in Hollywood, admitted he had been shocked by the savagery of one Fashanu attack on an unnamed Wimbledon player. ‘Fash literally lifted him up, swung him around and smashed him down on the floor and his calf just obliterated. The fella had to have 20 stitches or 30 stitches in his calf, split it to bits,’ he said. ‘Fash could be hilarious, a very funny man. But when he was angry, he was a very tough man.’ The programme also highlights a feud between Fashanu and Sanchez that ended with the latter calling a reporter and telling him Fashanu had tried to karate-kick his legs. Defender Scales was a witness. He told the programme: ‘We were used to seeing very unusual things but that face-to-face, coming to blows was the most shocking thing I saw.’ Striker Terry Gibson said: ‘For six years they never spoke to each other. They were in the same changing room but wouldn’t even celebrate together.’ Fashanu talks about the intimidation and violence around the club, saying: ‘We ruled by fear. Wonderful’ Wimbledon's Fashanu and John Scales talk to referee Keith Hackett during a win over Southampton in 1993 . The documentary has caused upset with former owner Hammam, who says: ‘It wasn’t the Fash show' Sanchez said: ‘From the first moment, he knew what I was and I knew what he was.’ Beasant thought Sanchez, who holds a university degree, regarded the more streetwise Fashanu as pretentious. Fashanu comes across as unapologetic in the film but does admit: ‘Sometimes I wince at some things we made them do. Locking them in the boot of their car, dragging them around the pitch. ‘I grabbed Scales by his nostrils. He had one of two choices, you either sink or swim. There were days when you thought Scalesy was almost breaking. But if he and Phelo (Terry Phelan) saw us today, they would say, “Thank you Fash”, you may have beaten the hell out of us but you changed our character.’ While some of the Crazy Gang loved the atmosphere instigated by Bassett and assistant Wally Downes, some of the later signings found it hard to cope. Scales, signed from Bristol Rovers, admits: ‘The first thing I’d think about was getting down to the pub and getting away from it, having a drink. Was it conducive to me playing well? Obviously not as an athlete. But at that stage it was a coping mechanism. ‘I remember getting in the car and getting psyched up for training so I would be able to cope for it. The Crazy Gang would swallow me up.’ While some of the Crazy Gang loved the atmosphere, others like Scales (left) found it hard to cope . Scales: ‘The first thing I’d think about was getting down to the pub and getting away from it, having a drink' Manchester United's Ryan Giggs is tackled by Wimbledon's Scales in 1993 . Phelan recalls seeing some players cry at the abuse they received. He said: ‘It was like a pack of wolves going out looking for blood. It wasn’t normal. I’ve seen players cry, physically break down. It was a place for me that was really dark for six months, socially and emotionally. ‘As a footballer you have dreams; for six months I had no dreams. I used to sit in my bedroom upstairs, and I’d say, “My career is gone, where can I go from here?”’ Downes is unrepentant at creating a culture where only the strongest survived. ‘Very tough love,’ he calls it. Scales and Phelan did survive and shared in the FA Cup glory. But some of the most savage treatment was saved for opponents, with centre half Andy Thorn admitting: ‘We went too far loads of times.’ Striker Alan Cork recalls putting Steve Bruce’s nose out of place in the opening minutes and then catching him on the other side. Jones summed up the deliberate intimidation. ‘There were a few punch-ups, there were a few confrontations. We’d look for an opponent who was weak and play on it. I’d say, “Wisey, we’ve got one here”. Jones went on to become an actor and the ex-Wimbledon player now plays tough guys in Hollywood . ‘We’d shout, “Put it in the mixer”, when the ball was in the air, you’d see their legs going, they’d be thinking “Oh, s***”. We were a proper organised force.’ For many Wimbledon players, it was a final chance to beat the odds. Barnardo’s child Fashanu, hod carrier Jones and Southampton reject Wise all went on to great careers after leaving Wimbledon, their characters moulded by learning at a tough school. There was black humour, too, with Bassett suggesting setting Cork’s car on fire after he had blocked him getting a pay rise. ‘He said, “What am I going to do?”. I said, “Go and burn your car and claim on the insurance”,’ said Bassett. And the fire did take place. It was the violence, though, that will divide opinion as to whether Wimbledon’s story was a fairytale or a nightmare. The last word went to Fashanu who was asked if he had any regrets. ‘Not striking Lawrie Sanchez sooner,’ he replied.

"Dual Irish champion jockey Barry Geraghty, whose 31 wins at the National Hunt Festival in March include all big three prizes – the Champion Hurdle, Champion Chase and Gold Cup, gives his assessment of the early clues for this season’s meeting. Hennessy Gold Cup winner Many Clouds looks worthy of taking his place in the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March but the one I took from the race was Djakadam even though he finished eighth. He is gorgeous, progressive horse and I am a big fan. The ground was a bit too soft for my mount, Triolo D’Alene, who was pulled up. On that going, over three miles and a quarter miles in a competitive handicap at Newbury, ideally you need to have had a run under your belt or be very, very fit. Djakadam ridden by Paul Townend (right), has recently caught the eye of jockey Barry Geraghty . Leighton Aspell riding Many Clouds (L) win The Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury racecourse on November 29 . Djakadam, on his seasonal debut, travelled well until fading in the last two furlongs. He looked like a horse who would improve an awful lot for the run. He might have been very unlucky at last season’s Festival when he fell and the fact that trainer Willie Mullins pitched him into a race like the Hennessy tells you a lot. Venetia Williams’ Hennessy runner-up Houblon Des Obeaux also ran a great race but appreciated the soft ground and you would have to question whether he would be as effective on better ground when assessing future prospects. Jockey Barry Geraghty will ride Bobs Worth in the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown on December 28 . I am looking forward to riding Bobs Worth in the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown on December 28. He won it last year like a class horse. For me, it was as good a run as his 2013 Gold Cup win. I’d like to think my possible mount Simonsig would be good enough to make the frame in the big Christmas chase in Britain, the King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day. But, even if he is ready to run, I’m not sure it is the right option for him for a first race of the season. Paul Nicholls-trained Silviniaco Conti looks a worthy favourite to win for a second year. He won Haydock’s Betfair Chase like a horse who had a bit in hand. Barry Geraghty riding West Wizard in action at Kempton Park racecourse last month . Unbeaten Faugheen is favourite for the Champion Hurdle but should he really be at the head of the pecking order? Probably not. He has been very impressive but hasn’t beaten a true Champion Hurdle contender yet. Putting that into context, last year’s third The New One has done all he has been asked in his two runs this season. Jezki, who I won the race on last season, was beaten by Hurricane Fly in his comeback but generally improves for running. There won’t be any panic in his camp yet. Faugheen, ridden by Ruby Walsh, goes on to win the Coral Hurdle at Ascot Racecourse on November 22 . Never judge a horse on one day. So I would not draw too drastic a conclusion on my World Hurdle winner More Of That losing his unbeaten record in Newbury’s Long Distance Hurdle. The hurdles’ track was a good bit softer than the chase track and his opposition included race-fit rivals. If you take a horse out of his comfort zone, it is very easy to get him beaten and he looked out of his comfort zone a lot of the way. If he has is a little breathing issue, I’m sure they will correct it but I would doubt he has lost the class he showed last season. Mullins-trained Valseur Lido won Sunday's Grade One Drinmore Novices's Chase . It is hard to find fault with Mullins-trained Valseur Lido’s win in Sunday’s Grade One Drinmore Novices’ Chase. That was the most impressive performance from a novice chaser I’ve seen this season. I won on John Ferguson’s Parlour Games at last month’s Cheltenham meeting and, at this stage, he is the novice hurdler which has made most impression on me.

"A sister has received offers from dozens of from potential suitors... after her brother decided to place a 'commercial' pleading for a date for her on Facebook, Gumtree and the Free Ads website. Adam Clarke, 26, decided it was about time his older sibling Natalie got a boyfriend, so he posted a video about his sister online. 'She hasn't had a boyfriend for a long while,' he says in the home-made clip, filmed in his car. 'Don't know whether it's because she's infertile, she's too old, whatever.' 'I'm not going to go into that because she'll kick off.' Adam and older sister Natalie are close, working together running media company Suave Productions . Adam recorded a video of his sister which he posted online alongside an advert for a date with her . Although she admits she was originally cross with her brother, Natalie now is enjoying sifting through the responses from men hoping to date her - having whittled it down to between five and eight suitors . 'We need to get her a boyfriend because she's doing my head in!' His unwitting sister then gets into the car, looking a tad taken aback when he explains what he's doing. He then continues: 'If anyone's interested, she's 33, she's got her own car, runs her own business, she's... I've run out of things to say about you. Anyway, if you're interested, add her on Facebook.' Adam put the video on Facebook without his sister's knowledge and then shared it on different sites such as Free Ads and Gumtree. When Natalie found out about the video she said 'at first I was shocked and kicked off but then I began to see the funny side and now I'm thankful'. The fact it was an an instant success and sparked multiple responses in just 24 hours may have helped. 'My laptop has not stopped beeping since,' says Natalie. Natalie scours the profiles of men who respond to the video, checking out their appearance and whether they can 'have a laugh' like her . 'It was not until we got home when he told me he shared it on his Facebook.' Adam says the video has been watched over 8,000 times so far and Natalie has had around 70 messages. She says she's whittled potential suitors down to between five and eight and may even be heading out on a date this week. Adam apparently was prompted to place the adverts when he found a girlfriend himself and wanted Natalie (right) to also find a special someone for 'balance' Adam and Natalie work together running media company Suave Productions, based in Cardiff. But after Adam found himself a girlfriend he felt 'it would be nice for her to have some balance, and get her head out of her laptop'.

"Asylum seekers have alleged guards at Nauru detention centre are sexually assaulting refugees on the compound. An asylum seeker who asked not to be identified has told Fairfax that guards on the South Pacific Island nation have threatened refugees with rape after they leave the compound, offered illicit substances in exchange for sex with under-age detainees, and made them expose themselves in order to have showers over two minutes long. Another asylum seeker alleged an Australian guard said he wanted to have sex with children on the island and forced two under age refugees to perform sexual acts in front on him. Police contain protests on Nauru detention centre, where there have been ongoing protests since last week, and 25 instances of self-harm from detainees . An asylum seeker who chose not to be identified has alleged that guards on Nauru detention centre (above) have threatened refugees with rape , offered illicit substances in exchange for sex with under-age detainees, and made them expose themselves in order to have showers over two minutes long . The allegations come as ongoing protests are being staged in Nauru over the decision to offer people on Christmas Island temporary protection and work rights in Australia, but not the those being held in Nauru. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison proposed the plan last week, which would allow the reintroduction of temporary protection visas and remove all asylum seekers from Christmas Island. The protests are also responding to the the decision to send Australian refugees to Cambodia, where there is also violent protests being staged outside the Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh, with activists demanding the refugee deal is abandoned. A spokesperson for the the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection told Daily Mail: 'Senator Hanson Young's allegations have been referred to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.' A spokesman for the Refugee Action Collective with Ian Rintoul said these are not the first sexual assault allegations from Nauru. 'We are looking into this most recent claim, but it's not an isolated incident. There has been a series of similar complaints over the last few months. 'We usually only get word of it when the detainees have to come to Australia for emergency medical treatment.' A spokesman for the Refugee Action Collective with Ian Rintoul told Daily Mail Australia these are not the first sexual assault allegations from Nauru . Senator Hanson-Young has written to Immigration Minister Scott Morrison, asking for an independent investigation into the shocking allegations and calling on him to 'act immediately.' Mr Rintoul said a contingent of security has flown in from Brisbane to counter the protests. There have been almost thirty instances of self-harm from Nauru asylum seekers, with five of these being young refugees who have stitched their lips together in protest . 'The proposed plan to eventually release some people from Chrsitmas Island has created a higher sense of despair on Nauru. The detainees on this island were arbitrarily selected-many came on the same boats.' Mr Rintoul said the protests on Nauru have been under way since last Thursday, and there extra security is being flown in from Australia. 'There has just been a batch of extra security flown in from Brisbane to counter the protests. As of yet, there have been almost thirty instances of self-harm from asylum seekers on Nauru.

"The firm making the sapphire glass integral to Apple's watch has filed for bankruptcy . GT Advanced Technologies was Apple's partner in a sapphire glass plant in . Arizona. It's 'unscratchable' glass had been rumoured to have been planned for the iPhone 6 - but failed to appear. Scroll down for video . Apple's watch was unveiled last month - but now the firm making the glass for it has gone bust . Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. As the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass. The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera. As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones. 'It's unbelievable ... I don't think anyone expected this,' said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in . Las Vegas. 'I can't remember the last time ... well Bear Stearns was . probably the last time, but we were in a financial crisis then. This was completely out of the blue.' The stock had more than doubled in the nine months between . November's announcement of the new Arizona plant and the launch . of Apple's new large-screen iPhones on Sept. 9 as investors . hoped GT would replicate Corning Inc's success with . Gorilla Glass. Since then the stock had slumped 36 percent after GT's . sapphire glass was left out of the new iPhones. GT had said a . month earlier that the Arizona plant would not be fully . operational until early 2015. 'It would appear that something very fundamentally broke . down in the relationship between Apple and GT Advanced,' Raymond . James analyst Pavel Molchanov said in an email. GT said on Aug. 5 it was expecting Apple to pay it $139 . million in connection with the plant. Apple had paid it $439 . million totally as of that date. The company had warned then that costs related to the plant . had a 'significant impact' on its liquidity and results. Still, . it forecast revenue of $600-$700 million for the full year, more . than double the $299 million it reported in 2013. According to data from Markit, which tracks short interest, . 43 percent of GT's shares outstanding were being loaned out for . short bets, a very high level that indicates there were plenty . of investors who thought this stock was headed lower. IDC analyst Danielle Levitas told VentureBeat that recent supplier checks spotted ‘several reports of the sapphire failures' ahead of the iPhone launch. During standard drop tests, the screen was said to have repeatedly cracked, forcing Apple to resort to another method. VentureBeat additionally reports that the decision to switch screens was made just weeks before the launch event. Apple will use a sapphire screen for two of the three . versions of its Apple Watch, which will be available early next . year. It also uses the material on the camera cover and touch . sensor button on its iPhones. The deal with Apple placed restrictions on GT selling the . sapphire screens for use in certain applications, according to . the company's regulatory filings. GT gave Apple an exclusive license for certain applicationsof its sapphire glass technology, but the iPad maker had noobligation to buy the glass, according to the filings.

"Georgia police were called to help a man who was stabbed and locked in the bathroom of a friend's apartment after a date at a nearby McDonald's that was arranged through a mobile dating app. The two men originally contacted each other on Tinder, a popular mobile app, and agreed to meet up in September at a McDonald's just off the parkway in Kennesaw. The meeting went well at first, and the two returned to an apartment owned by the victim's friend located 20 minutes away in northwest Atlanta. Swiped: An Atlanta man met up with a date at a McDonald's, only to be stabbed and have his car stolen later in the afternoon . According to a police report, the victim said the two were 'fooling around' when the other man began stabbing him with what the victim thought was a pocket knife. He said his assailant then forced him into the bathroom and locked him inside while he made off with his money and his Honda Accord. The victim managed to escape from the bathroom and stumbled out of the apartment where he ran across a yard crew working outside. He was bleeding from four stab wounds, according to WSBTV and was transported by ambulance to the hospital. Police are still looking for the suspect and it is not clear whether the stabbing and theft were planned ahead of time.

"At nearly £14,000 to send a kilogram of food into space, cosmic cuisine doesn’t come cheap. But by December this year, Nasa plans to have grown its own food in space for the first time. As well as cutting costs, Nasa is hoping its space farm will be scaled up to deliver a lasting supply of food for astronauts on deep space missions. By December, Nasa plans to have grown its own food in space for the first time. In preparation for the project, the space agency grew plants under red and blue lights to better understand growth patterns . It could also provide something called ‘horticultural therapy’ for astronauts to reduce stress, alleviate depression and improve their overall general health. The work is part of the Vegetable Production System (VEGGIE) to grow six romaine lettuce plants under pink LED lamps, according to a report by Modern Farmer. Jesse Hirsch reports that Kevlar pillow-packs, filled with a material similar to kitty litter, will function as planters for the lettuce which will be ready to harvest after just 28 days. Nasa claims that after extensive testing on plants on Earth, it doesn’t expect zero-gravity conditions to affect the growth of the plants. The Vegetable Production System (VEGGIE) will grow six lettuce plants under pink LED lamps in space . Nasa claims that after extensive testing on plants on Earth, it doesn't expect zero-gravity conditions to change the growth of the plants. Dr Matthew Mickens, a plant biologist from North Carolina Agriculture and Technical State University, is pictured measuring Cherry Bomb Hybrid II radish plants for Nasa . Earlier this year, a team of ‘gastronauts’ spent four months living in a small dome on a barren Hawaii lava field, trying to find out what foods astronauts might eat on a mission to Mars. The group of six had been working as part of a $1 million Nasa HI-SEAS (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) project. Team commander Angelo Vermeulen said the problem with ingredients that are not perishable is they're usually highly processed and lack fibre.He added that he was impressed with how freeze dried products taste very similar to fresh produce.  A favourite among the crew was nutella, the chocolate-hazelnut spread. ‘It's something we craved,’ he said. ‘We had a limited supply so we had to ration it.’ The bigger problems is cosmic microbes that could develop in the lettuce. Nasa said all plants grown in on the International Space Station (ISS) in December will undergo strict testing on Earth before they are consumed. While Nasa has tested plant growth in space before for academic purposes, this is the first project to grow food with the aim of sustaining future astronauts. Last month, Nasa also revealed that it had given 3D printer firm Systems & Materials Research Corporation (SMRC) a six month, $125,000 grant to focus on developing a universal food synthesiser. The device is similar to the ‘replicator’ used in several of the Star Trek TV series which enabled crew members . to create their favourite foods. Nasa said it is investing in the project because it wants to make it easier to transport nutrients in bulk through space. Astronaut Peggy Whitson, flight engineer (left) and Cosmonaut Valery Korzun, commander (right), are showing eating a meal send from Earth. The current cost of sending food into space is around £14,000 per kg . SMRC’s founder Anjan Contractor added that the device will also help solve the Earth’s looming food crisis. Meanwhile, China has said it is preparing plans to grow fresh vegetables on Mars and the moon after researchers successfully completed a preliminary test in Beijing. Four kinds of vegetables were grown in an 'ecological life support system', a 300 cubic metre cabin which will allow astronauts to develop their own stocks of air, water and food while on space missions. The system, which relies on plants and algae, is 'expected to be used in extra-terrestrial bases on the moon or Mars', according to a report by Xinhua news agency.","Nasa plans to grow six romaine lettuce plants under pink LED lamps on the International Space Station within the next three months .

"A freshwater trout stabbed in the back while swimming in a Swiss lake has caused outrage among animal rights activists. The fish was filmed swimming just beneath the surface of Lake Bausee in Switzerland by a stunned tourist. The holiday maker spotted the distinctive red case of a Swiss Army Knife moving through the water when they noticed the knife rammed just behind the fish's neck. Scroll down for video . The trout was spotted swimming in Lake Bausee in Switzerland by a shocked tourist earlier this week . The fish had a Swiss Army Knife worth £50 jammed into his back by an unidentified assailant . The tourist who declined to leave his real name said: 'I couldn't believe it at first, I was sitting by the beautiful Blausee lake while on holiday in Switzerland, and then I saw this trout with a knife in its head. 'Mind you, the fish didn't seem to be bothered by it. I guess someone was probably sitting on the pier maybe eating a snack and dropped the knife - hitting the unfortunate fish. 'If they were eating bread there would have been loads of fish looking for crumbs so its not such a surprise I guess. The fish was seriously in the wrong place at the wrong time.' Animal rights activists however took to the web to demand the animal torturer be caught, and punished. The knives cost a minimum of £50 in Switzerland.

"Shaun Reid barked one last piece of advice for his Warrington Town players as they pulled into the Gateshead International Stadium for their FA Cup second round tie on Sunday. 'This is no day out,' he growled. 'And anyone who thinks that can stay on the f***ing coach.' The Conference ground may be better-known for athletics than football – local boy Brendan Foster famously broke a world record there – but it could have been Wembley Stadium for the gardeners, plasterers and pizza delivery drivers who made up the Warrington team. VIDEO Scroll down to see behind the scenes match day footage with Shaun Reid and his Warrington Town squad .

Warrington's players go through their pre-match routine in the away dressing room at the Gateshead International Stadium . A pensive Shaun Reid takes in his surroundings ahead of kick-off in the FA Cup second round tie . Even to reach this stage of the competition was a miracle for a club who sit 16th in the northern section of the Evo-Stik League – the eighth tier of English football – and 79 places below Gateshead in the pyramid. Manager Reid, younger brother of Everton and England star Peter, doesn't mind being considered old school. Over team breakfast at the Mercure Hotel in Washington on Sunday morning, he mused that the trappings might make his team soft. 'You need hunger to win. It's all about this,' beating his chest as he sat down for his scrambled eggs and toast. Reid and Warrington, who became national heroes by beating League Two Exeter City in the first round, kindly granted Sportsmail access all areas for their big day. Warrington's part-time players have breakfast at their team hotel ahead of the biggest match in the club's history . Warrington, who play in the Northern Premier League Division One North, have never advanced this far in the FA Cup . The Warrington squad inspect the pitch at the Gateshead International Stadium in the run-up to kick-off . It's a little bit crowded in the away dressing room as the Warrington squad get themselves ready for the second round tie . More than a thousand Wire fans, four times their average home gate, had travelled the 160 miles north, which was as cold and windy as you'd expect approaching Christmas. If those supporters had heard Reid and his coach Stuart Mellish in the dressing-room beforehand, they would have put on boots themselves and prepared to run through brick walls. It was intense stuff. 'Help your mates out there. There will be mistakes and when they happen, help each other. I believe in you,' implored Reid. 'Go and make history,' shouted Mellish, who had the unenviable task of reading out the chosen team line-up in the dressing-room an hour before kick off.

The Warrington fans create a colourful display with blue and yellow smoke flares at the International Stadium . The pair went through some cup battles as team-mates at Rochdale including one infamous League Cup tie against Wimbledon when Reid responded to being bitten on the arm by Vinnie Jones, by biting him on the neck. It was a family affair too. Chairman Toby Macormac's wife and two young children travelled with him to the stadium on the players' team coach although Reid ushered them off on arrival before he embarked on a motivational speech he knew would contain swear words. Craig Robinson, brother of MK Dons manager Karl, was blessed at the team hotel by his nine-year-old daughter and 20 members of the Reid family travelled together to the game from Merseyside. Unfortunately in football, there is always an opponent to upset best-laid plans. Gateshead started like a side operating three divisions higher than Warrington. With 35-year-old former Everton and Wales international John Oster pulling the strings, they took the lead after eight minutes through former Newcastle United striker Matty Pattison. And it was only grim determination from Warrington, allied to saves by goalkeeper Karl Wills and two Gateshead attempts that hit the woodwork that kept the game close.

As Reid rallied the troops at half-time, Macormac and the other directors took stock over a cup of coffee. 'You can see the benefits of being full-time,' said board member Gary Skentlebury. Warrington's players earn around £70-a-week from football. But the Cheshire minnows, the lowest-ranked side left in the competition, did themselves proud after half-time in front of the BT Sport cameras. Scot Metcalfe went close to an equaliser and substitute Ashley Ruane was denied a strong penalty appeal. Metcalfe is arguably Town's best player but has an attitude that needs work. 'I tried to sign him for 14 months but he didn't want to leave New Mills because they were near his house,' said Reid, before smiling 'but I got him in the end.' A late second goal from Wright after a mis-kick by Wills sealed Gateshead's win as the form book demanded. Reid tried to gee his players up afterwards. 'We have to go again and win the league,' he said. 'You are good players.' Danny Wright celebrates scoring Gateshead's second goal in stoppage time at the end of the game .

Then his real feelings were revealed as he turned the corner and aggressively swiped a jug of water off a nearby table and covered the floor. On Monday it will be Gateshead, managed by former Nottingham Forest European Cup winner, who will be alongside Manchester United and Liverpool in the FA Cup third round draw. But Warrington won't be forgotten in a hurry after their amazing nine-match run in the competition. They have earned nearly £200,000 from this season's FA Cup – equivalent to five years' revenue in normal times - and have ended the notion that Warrington is exclusively a rugby town. But now, in time-honoured tradition, they have to concentrate on the league.

"North Korea has closed its borders to protect itself from the Ebola outbreak, a travel agent specialising in tours of the secretive nation has said. All foreign tourists will be banned from visiting the reclusive state from tomorrow in an attempt to stop the deadly virus from reaching the country. Koryo Tours posted an announcement on its Twitter and Facebook pages, saying it had been told that no foreign tourists would be allowed to cross North Korea's heavily-guarded borders .

Tourists will be banned from entering North Korea from tomorrow as the country seeks to protect itself from the Ebola virus, a travel agent specialising in trips to the country said (file picture) Despite the secretive nature of North Korea, around 2,600 people visit the country each year. However, this figure is likely to drop because of the border closure, which could last for months. The measures do not appear to be a blanket ban on travel to North Korea, Beijing-based Koryo Tours said, with business trips likely to still go ahead. Nick Bonner, the company's co-founder, said: 'The situation seems to still be in flux, and while the early news from our partners in Pyongyang was that all tourists would be barred from entering, we are still hopeful of taking in three groups we have scheduled to travel for the rest of 2014.' Officials in Pyongyang did not comment, however the state's news agency KCNA said today that no cases of Ebola has been detected in the country. Visitors and luggage have been subject to stricter monitoring at airports, seaports and border railway crossings to China in recent days. North Korea imposed a similar travel ban in 2003 following the SARS scare, which killed more than 700 people in eastern Asia (file picture) Efforts have also been made to increase public awareness of the killer virus and its symptoms. North Korean television news on Wednesday evening showed a video of Ebola patients and explained the dangers of the disease. The move by Kim Jong-un's government makes North Korea the first country to close off its borders because of the Ebola outbreak. The country similarly closed its borders after the SARS scare in eastern Asia in 2003. The World Health Organisation says that least 4,877 people have died from Ebola this year, with nearly 10,000 cases recorded, but the true toll could be three times higher .","Foreign tourists will not be allowed into the secretive nation from tomorrow .

"It has long been considered the most upmarket of supermarkets, and now Waitrose has cemented its reputation with a range of ‘essential’ items so unnecessary that shoppers have taken to the internet to mock it. Vermicelli nests, baby avocados, kelp soap and cotton flower ironing water are among the unusual products to find themselves branded as ‘essentials’. Limoncello dessert, parmesan and pâté are on the list, too. So are dinner candles, cappuccino mousse, lardons, artichoke hearts and cardamom and black pepper soap. With many British households still feeling the effects of the recession, one critic posted a photo of the ‘essential Waitrose’ pasta product with the sarcastic observation: ‘How does one get through the day without some vermicelli nests?’ Scroll down for video . Critics have taken to the internet to mock Waitrose over the type of food included on their 'essential' range . One wag commented on ‘How does one get through the day without some vermicelli nests?’ ‘What sort of a ponce thinks blueberries are essential?’ asked another baffled commenter. When the essential Waitrose range was first launched, the supermarket promised customers that though prices might be lower than some of its other offerings – such as the free-range goose eggs that sold for £6.99 each – the range would still offer ‘the reassurance of Waitrose values’. Since then, it has expanded to 2,100 items, including many that might seem more at home in a delicatessen or a niche cosmetics store. The attack on Waitrose is far from the first time the supermarket and its clientele have been mocked. In July, the Overheard In Waitrose Facebook page attracted headlines by revealing shoppers’ exchanges including ‘Sebastian, supper is in the tagine’ and ‘Lucas, put that falafel down, you already chose olives with manchego as your treat’. Last night a defiant Waitrose spokeswoman said that rather than removing products from the essential Waitrose range, the supermarket has plans ‘in the pipeline’ to add 500 items to it. She said: ‘Put simply, if it’s essential to our customers, it’s essential to us. ‘Nearly eight out of ten baskets at our supermarket now contain at least one essential Waitrose item.’ A spokeswoman for Waitrose defended their essential range claiming 80 per cent of shoppers choose it .","The up-market retailer has a new essential range containing 2,100 items .

"The head of Richard Branson's space tourism firm has insisted Virgin Galactic could have . a new spacecraft ready to fly by next year once the investigation into last week's deadly crash has completed. George Whitesides, reacting to safety concerns after the Virgin SpaceShipTwo went down in the Mojave Desert, told the Financial Times the new model is 65 per cent complete. He also insisted that the new fuel system used in the aircraft that exploded mid air had been rigorously tested. Michael Alsbury, 39, was killed when the aircraft went down in the Mojave Desert while pilot Peter Siebold, 43, is still being treated in hospital. Scroll down for video . Looking to the future: The head of Richard Branson's space tourism firm has insisted Virgin Galactic could havea new spacecraft ready to fly by next year, even though a pilot died during a test flight last week . CEO George Whitesides, pictured with Richard Branson, said the new fuel system used in Virgin'sSpaceShipTwo, which crashed last week, was rigorously tested . Whitesides said a second craft being built for Virgin was . about 65 percent complete as federal investigators were just beginning what could be a year-long investigation into the accident. 'The second spaceship is getting close to readiness,' he . said, adding that it could be ready to fly by next year once the . probe by the National Transportation Safety Board reached its . conclusions. His remarks followed a somber assessment of the future of . Virgin Galactic by founder Branson, who hoped to be among the . first passengers on its maiden voyage that had been expected . early next year. 'We really thought by March of next year, we'd be there,' the billionaire entrepreneur told the BBC after arriving in . Mojave on Saturday. 'Something went wrong. We need to find out . what went wrong and fix it.' U.S. investigators say the powered test flight of Virgin's . SpaceShipTwo on Friday was well recorded, giving them an . abundance of information to help determine what caused it to . crash and spread debris over a 5-mile (8 km) swath of the Mojave . Desert, 95 miles (150 km) north of Los Angeles. Whitesides said a second craft being built for Virgin was about 65 percent complete as federal investigators were just beginning what could be a year-long investigation into the accident . 'We owe it to our pilots to find out exactly what went . wrong,' Branson said during a Saturday news conference in . Mojave. 'If we can overcome it, we will make absolutely certain . that the dream lives on.' Alsbury, who police said was found dead in the aircraft and . who resided in Tehachapi, California, was a project engineer and . test pilot at Scaled Composites, a Northrop Grumman Corp . subsidiary that built and designed the craft for Virgin . Galactic. Alsbury was flying for the ninth time aboard SpaceShipTwo, . including serving as the co-pilot on its first rocket-powered . test flight on April 29, 2013, according to the company's . website. Siebold parachuted from SpaceShipTwo and was found with . serious injuries by rescuers, who took him by helicopter to . Antelope Valley Hospital, the Kern County Sheriff's Office said . in a statement. He was alert and talking with his family and doctors on . Saturday, Scaled Composites said in a statement. An aircraft flying behind SpaceShipTwo collected video . images and radar data, and a range camera at Edwards Air Force . Base also recorded the failed test flight, Hart said. The . spaceship had video cameras and data storage cards on board . which could help investigators. Tragic: Michael Alsbury, 39, was killed when the aircraft went down in the Mojave Desert on Friday . Friday's crash was the second disaster in less than a week . suffered by a private space company, dealing a blow to the . fledgling commercial space industry that has been taking on work . traditionally done by governments. On Tuesday, an Antares rocket built and launched by Orbital . Sciences Corp exploded after liftoff from Wallops . Island, Virginia, destroying a cargo ship bound for the . International Space Station. The Virgin probe will likely focus on SpaceShipTwo's rocket . engine, which on Friday was flying with a new type of fuel for . the first time, experts said. The solid plastic-type propellant is ignited by liquid . nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas. Virgin Galactic announced in May it was replacing the . rubber-based propellant used during the spaceship's three . previous rocket-powered test flights to get better performance. Aspirations: On Saturday, Richard Branson said once they 'overcome' last week's crash, they will ensure that the 'dream lives on' Before Friday's flight, SpaceShipTwo's last powered test . flight was in January, though the rocket and its new propellant . had passed multiple ground tests. 'We have put that motor through a rigorous ground development . program,' Whitesides said in the FT interview. 'The results of . those tests were positive.'

"The global Ebola death toll has risen to almost 5,000. And as humanitarian efforts ramp up, US roboticists and government groups are planning a summit to discuss how robots could be the key to curbing the spread of the disease. During a series of events in November, these experts will share the results of current research and debate what kind of robots are needed to help manage the crisis. During a series of events in November, roboticists will share the results of current research and debate what kind of robots are needed to help manage the crisis. For example, germ-killing robot 'Little Moe' (pictured) is designed to rid a room of dangerous viruses in minutes, and is being used to keep hospitals Ebola-free . The first talk will be co-hosted by the Texas A&M University’s Centre for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASAR), on 7 November, led by professor of computer science and engineering Robin Murphy. Simultaneous events will be also be held by the White House of Science and Technology Policy, Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the University of California, Berkeley. In a blog post, Professor Murphy outlined nine ways robots could play a role in stopping the Ebola outbreak. These included mortuary robots, to transport the deceased, robots that can detect and disinfect rooms, ambulances and houses that have held infected people, as well as ‘rolling interpreters’ to help translate between aid workers, doctors and patients. Simultaneous events will be also be held by the White House of Science and Technology Policy, Texas A&M, Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the University of California, Berkeley. Other robots that will be discussed including drones that can deliver food and medicine (DHL's Parcelcopter is pictured) Automated trucks could also deliver aid. In February, the US Army tested a convoy of autonomous military trucks in Fort Hood Texas (pictured). The demonstration was a joint project between the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Centre (TARDEC) and Lockheed Martin in Maryland . For example, a germ-killing robot designed to rid a room of dangerous viruses in minutes is being used to keep hospitals Ebola-free. Called 'Little Moe', the robot works by damaging viral DNA using pulses of ultraviolet light. It is currently being used in 250 hospitals and health facilities across the US, including a Dallas hospital where a patient with the first case of Ebola diagnosed in America was being treated. Similarly, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centre have created ‘Violet’ – a robot that emits ultraviolet light that penetrates and damages bacteria, including Clostridium difficile (C. diff), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and potentially Ebola. Professor Robin Murphy proposes nine possible technologies that could help tackle the disease. These include: . Mortuary robots: These would respectfully transport the deceased, because Ebola is most virulent at the time of death, and immediately following death . Robot replacements for health professionals: Robots that could be used in biosafety labs and field hospitals, for tasks such as automated materials handling and remote patient care. Detection of contamination: Robots that scour vehicles, rooms, buildings and even public spaces for signs of the disease ambulance or house have Ebola . Disinfection: Robots that open the drawers and doors for the commercially available Little Moe disinfectant robot . Professor Robin Murphy proposes nine possible technologies that could help tackle the disease. These include Mortuary robots that would transport the deceased, and reconnaisance drones and bots that scour for signs of illness and people fleeing infected regions (iRobot 510 PackBot is pictured) Telepresence robots: Experts could use such robots to consult and advise on medical issues, train and supervise worker decontamination, and serve as 'rolling interpreters' for the different languages and dialects. Physical security: Robotic guards to protect workers during riots, as those seen in Sierra Leone. Waste handling: Robots that transport biowaste from infected sites. Humanitarian relief: This includes autonomous food trucks and drones that deliver food and medicine. Reconnaissance: Drones and other types of robots that scour for signs of illness and people fleeing infected regions . All of which are commonly referred to as 'superbugs' because they are highly resistant to traditional antibiotic treatments. Other ideas include autonomous food trucks and delivery drones, as well as reconnaissance and telepresence robots. Logistics firm DHL, owned by Germany's Deutsche Post, is planning to send 'parcelcopters' flying at up to 40mph (65km/h) to the car-free island of Juist, off Germany's northern coast. Text messages are currently helping in the fight against Ebola in Sierra Leone, with people receiving public health text alerts and sending messages about food security to aid agencies (pictured). Experts could use similar services to consult and advise on medical issues and train and supervise worker decontamination . The global Ebola death toll has risen to almost 5,000. Ebola (pictured) emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo.There are several strains which vary in how dangerous they are to humans, but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent . The drone is designed to deliver medication and other urgently needed goods to the island at times when other modes of transport are not operating. Ebola emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo. There are several strains which vary in how dangerous they are to humans, but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent. In the current outbreak that is just over 50 per cent. It is introduced into humans through direct contact with the blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals including fruit bats, which are eaten as a delicacy. The virus then spreads between humans through direct contact with blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people. Symptoms include fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. People are infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus and the incubation period can range between two and 21 days. Although the disease has no cure, modern medical treatment and quick isolation help hugely to bring the death toll down. If the trial is successful, the craft could be used to deliver packages to other remote areas, or in emergencies such as during the Ebola crisis. In February, the US Army tested a convoy of autonomous military trucks in Fort Hood Texas. The demonstration was a joint project between the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Centre (TARDEC) and Lockheed Martin in Maryland. Each of the driverless tactical vehicles were tested on their abilities to navigate hazards and obstacles including road intersections, oncoming traffic, stalled and passing vehicles, pedestrians and traffic circles in both urban and rural test areas. The autonomous vehicles were part of the Army and Marine Corps’ Autonomous Mobility Appliqué System (AMAS) program. The successful convoy was the final stage of the program’s Capabilities Advancement Demonstration. ‘In order to be successful at any one of the tasks, robots have to meet a lot of hidden requirements and sometimes the least exciting or glamorous job can be of the most help to the workers,’ explained Professor Murphy. ‘Can an isolated field hospital handle a heavy robot in the muddy rainy season? How will the robots be transported there? 'Is it easy enough for the locals to use so that they can be engaged and earn a living wage? What kind of network communication is available? What if it needs repairs? ‘That’s what I am working on, applying the lessons learned in robotics for meteorological and geological disasters.’ Texas A&M students will also be creating prototype aid robots as part of the Aggies Invent ‘What Would You Build for a First Responder’ event this weekend, while graduate students will be students designing and simulating intelligent robots. CRASAR is additionally planning to host another workshop to share the results of their current research into specific use cases with the robotics community in January. This year has seen the worst outbreak in history of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). This scene shows bodies being taken away in Sierra Leone. Professor Robin Murphy from Texas A&M University claims that this high death toll requires so-called mortuary robots to transport the deceased .","Summit will be hosted by Centre for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue .

"If you’ve ever wanted to have a draught beer machine that works as well as a Nespresso coffee maker, then Heineken may have the answer. The Dutch group has teamed up with Apple industrial designer Marc Newson to create a home draft beer gadget named ‘The Sub’. The company claims it will allow anyone in the world to experience different types of beer that may otherwise be unavailable in draught form. Scroll down for video . Heineken has teamed up with Apple industrial designer Marc Newson to create a home draft beer gadget named ‘The Sub’ (pictured) In a recent interview with Dezeen, Mr Newson who described himself as a ‘consistent beer drinker’, . ‘I guess you may ask ""what's the point?"",’ Mr Newson told the website. ‘The point is that draft beer is fundamentally for people that like beer and drink beer, and who know that draft beer is far superior to beer that you will get in a can or a bottle.’ The 16-inch (41cm) device looks like a metal beer cask with a tap connected at one end. The body sits on a base and it has a red button at the front to switch the device on. The Sub will allow anyone to experience different types of beer otherwise unavailable in draught form . The 16-inch (41cm) device looks like a metal beer cask with a tap connected at one end (overhead view on the left). The body sits on a base and it has a red button (right) at the front to switch the device on . Having beer on tap was once a distant dream for many. But the rise of the Kegerator – a combination between a keg and a refrigerator – has meant that freshly poured, draught beer is being enjoying in homes across the country. The concept was born out of the DIY skill sharing community when those desperate for beer on tap found ingenious ways to get it by re-engineering their fridges. And it quickly caught on commercially. For instance, Wisconsin-based Nostalgia Electronics is now offering its ‘Kegorator Beer Keg Fridge’ for around $600 (£360). The pressurised system claims to keep beer carbonated for weeks and has a portable unit with rolling casters to move it to any location. Henieken's latest is more portable and cheaper at  €249 (£195). It can be filled with Torps, which are pressurised modules that hold two litres of beer, with different types ordered from the company. The Torps are placed horizontally into a circular compartment in the middle of the machine. One of the biggest advantages of the Sub is that it will enable home drinkers to pour themselves the exact amount of their preferred beer. ""My wife for example, who loves beer, doesn't ever drink a whole can of it. Half a can will sit there, get warm and get thrown out,"" Mr Newson told Dezeen. ""This enables you to have any amount of beer, you could have a thimble full if you wanted and it would be as good as a big glass."" The Sub costs €249 (£195) and is a development from a similar product launched by Heineken 10 years ago. It is currently available in a ‘Signal Black’ edition across France and Italy. It will go on sale in the UK next year, but other markets have yet to announced.

"An entertainment executive pledged a collection of paintings by Pablo Picasso, Claude Monet, Edgar Degas and other major artists to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Thursday, a donation the institution called the largest in its history. 'Los Angeles helped make my career possible,' said Jerry Perenchio, the former chairman and CEO of Univision who has lived in the city for 70 years. 'My family and I are proud and honored to be able to give something back to a wonderful city.' Hollywood mogul Jerry Perenchio seen speaking today during a news conference at Los Angeles County Museum of Art announcing his donation of the largest collection of art in the history of the museum . Nympheas by Claude Monet from ca, 1905 is one of the paintings that was donated . The collection consists of about 47 pieces, including paintings, works on paper and sculpture, and the majority of it focuses on the 1870s through the 1930s. Among the pieces are Impressionist paintings by Monet, Edouard Manet and Paul Cezanne; a surrealist work by Rene Magritte; and a 1909 portrait by Picasso that presages his later Cubist efforts. The museum declined to put a value on the collection, but CEO Michael Govan said at a press conference that 'LACMA could never afford to buy these artworks on our own.' The collection also includes works by Fernand Leger, Camille Pissaro and Pierre Bonnard. 'In sum, this collection comprises the greatest gift of art to LACMA in its history,' Govan said. The bequest, which goes into effect after Perenchio's death, comes with one condition: The museum must first complete construction of a new building designed by Swiss architect Peter Zumthor, which is planned for 2023. An image of a painting from the the collection of art being donated by Hollywood mogul Jerry Perenchio (pictured second left) appears on a monitor during a news conferencetoday . Edgar Degas' Au Cafe Concert: Le Chanson de Chien, from 1875 was also donated . The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Wednesday approved a tentative plan for a $600 million redesign of the museum's campus, which would include tearing down and replacing most of its structures. The centerpiece of the renovation would be a huge, amoeba-shaped building featuring gallery space in the form of a bridge over Wilshire Boulevard. The usually camera-shy Perenchio said he came into the spotlight to encourage gift-giving by others, calling a dedication to the arts the 'heart and soul' of any city. He said he hopes to 'encourage all types of donations, large and small. Hopefully more large than small.' In 2006, Perenchio announced the sale of Univision to an investor group for $13.5 billion. Prior to that, he co-owned Loews Theaters and Tandem Productions, which was responsible for television hits including 'All in the Family' and 'Diff'rent Strokes.' Perenchio began his career as a talent agent, with a roster of clients including Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor. Claude Monet's The Artist's Garden at Vétheuil, painted between 1840 - 1926, 1880, oil on canvas - is one of the paintings donated . Portrait of M. Gauthier-Lathuille, son of the owner of 'Le Pere Lathuille' restaurant (pastel on canvas) by Manet, Edouard (1832-83) pastel on canvas was also donated .","Jerry Perenchio began his career as a talent agent, with a roster of clients including Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor .

"There isn’t a single country in the world where a woman can earn as much as a man for doing the same job and it is likely to be another 81 years before that gender gap closes, according to a new report by the World Economic Forum. In the U.S., the wage gap between men and women closed by just one percent in the past year to 66 percent - ‘meaning that women earn about two-thirds of what men earn for similar work according to the perception of business leaders,’ said WEF economist and report author Saadia Zahidi. America did however move up three places to 20th on the overall annual gender equality list which also looked at health, education and political participation in 142 countries. Cheer up! The World Economic Forum predicts that woman could enjoy true parity with men before the end of the century . Iceland topped the list for the sixth year running, while Yemen finished last. The Nordic states all topped the list, with Finland, Norway and Sweden following Iceland in the top five. Rwanda came into the rankings for the first time and took seventh place, making it the highest-ranking African economy. The U.S. inched up three places to 20 thanks to wage gaps having narrowed and the percentage of women in political and ministerial-level positions improving. Iceland topped the annual Global Gender Gap Report for the sixth year running, while Yemen finished last . Zahidi said Rwanda's success was because there are almost as many women as men at work - and in the country's ministerial offices - rather than because of improved access to health and education services. Nicaragua rose to become the sixth-best place for women (up from 10 last year). The Philippines remained the highest-ranking Asian state, but fell from fifth to ninth place. The outcomes of these scores are influenced by social forces. Globally, much of the progress on gender equality has come from more women entering politics and the workforce, she said Zahidi. The U.S. ranked 20th overall, going as high as 4th for economic opportunity but as low as 62nd for health and survival .","U.S. ranked a disappointing 65th among the 142 countries in the WEF report in terms of wage equality .

"Surveillance video was released Wednesday showing the moment that 22-year-old John Crawford III was fatally shot by police holding a toy rifle in an Ohio Walmart. The Plain Dealer reports Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine released the tape  after a grand jury found the officers' actions were justified. A full video presented by the Plain Dealer shows Crawford standing in the back of the store minutes before the shooting, holding a pellet gun in one hand and speaking on a cellphone with the other. Scroll down for video . Surprised: The video shows John Crawford III, 22, turn towards officers a split second before he falls to the floor . The video seems to contradict the details in the 911 call by Ronald Ritchie, who told dispatchers Crawford was loading the gun and 'pointing it at people.' 'He just pointed it at two children,' Ritchie says at one point. On the video, a woman and two children have walked into frame, but Crawford appears not to notice them. Moments later, two police officers' feet appear on another camera angle before Crawford is shot, falling to his side, and the officers close in on him. The surveillance tape has no sound of the incident. Police claimed Crawford failed to follow orders to put down the gun. 'The final analysis is that my son was murdered,' Crawford's father, John Crawford, Jr., told the Enquirer. 'All this nonsense of 'Put the weapon down' two or three times,' Crawford, Jr., added. 'There was no reaction from him. There couldn't have been a cadence given.' Injustice: Crawford III, pictured here with his mother, Tressa Sherrod, was fatally shot by police in the back of an Ohio Walmart. His father has called the shooting a 'murder' The family had asked for the release of the video tape, which Attorney General DeWine was unwilling to do, stating that it could taint the investigation and trial. State Representative Alecia Reece, who is the head of the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus, also asked for the public release of the surveillance footage. In the end, the Greene County grand jury opted not to issue any indictments against police officers, Special Prosecutor Mark Piepmeier told the Associated Press. The Department of Justice has said it will look into the shooting and Crawford's family has pushed for a federal investigation to see if race played a role in the incident.","John Crawford III was in the back corner of a Walmart holding an MK-177 pellet gun and talking on his cellphone .

"The seriously injured Virgin Galactic astronaut who parachuted out of the space plane that exploded on a test flight yesterday is awake in hospital and able to speak to his family. Peter Siebold, earlier identified as the sole survivor of the destroyed SpaceShipTwo craft, was today described as 'alert' after suffering serious injuries in the fatal crash. Siebold, a 43-year-old father of two, reportedly suffered a serious shoulder injury in the disaster, and is due for surgery soon. But Scaled Composites, Virgin Galactic's partner company, confirmed today he was conscious and communicative. Scroll down for videos . Critical: Peter Siebold (left, getting prepped with Michael Alsbury before the first guide flight in 2010) was critically injured in Friday's explosion . Best friends: Siebold and Alsbury celebrate after completing their run in 2010, which Richard Branson was on hand to watch . The seasoned pilot lives Tehachapi, California, near the Virgin Galactic spaceport. He was a wife, Traci, and two children. Michael Alsbury, his co-pilot, was killed when the experimental craft was destroyed at 45,000ft after detaching from another plane which was carrying it over the Mojave Desert in California. A statement from Scaled Composites today said: 'The Scaled Composites family lost a respected and devoted colleague yesterday, Michael Alsbury, who was the co-pilot for the test flight of SpaceShipTwo. 'Peter Siebold, the Director of Flight Operations at Scaled Composites, was piloting SpaceShipTwo. 'He is alert and talking with his family and doctors. We remain focused on supporting the families of the two pilots and all of our employees, as well as the agencies investigating the accident.' Back at base: Siebold lives in Tehachapi, California, not far from the Spaceport from which SpaceShipTwo flew . The company did not go into detail over his injuries. But Siebold is currently hospitalized with his shoulder injury at Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, California, the LA Times reported. Siebold and Alsbury regularly flew the plane as a duo, and had made successful trips as recently as August 28. Their identities were first reported Friday evening by Flying Mag. Branson has yet to say anything about Siebold, although the Virgin CEO was on hand when he and Alsbury flew the plane's first glide flight in 2010. Branson had previously claimed he never met Alsbury. Siebold, a Scaled Composite pilot like Alsbury, flew his first solo flight and gained his pilot’s license at 16 - the youngest age possible - and went on to teach flight classes at the San Luis Obispo Airport while he was a student at Cal Poly. He completed his degree in 2001. He was also one of the test pilots for SpaceShipOne, a experimental spaceplane that completed the first manned private spaceflight in 2004. As a design engineer at its aerospace company Scaled Composites, Siebold was responsible for the simulator, navigation system, and ground control system for the SpaceShipOne project. Tragic loss: Alsbury (above) was also a married father of two, and his family was close with the Siebold . Natural: Siebold earned his pilot's license when he was just 16-years-old . In 2009, he was awarded the Iven C. Kincheloe award - the most prestigious award a test pilot can receive - for his role as chief test pilot on the Model 348 WhiteKnightTwo plane, used to lift the SpaceShipTwo spacecraft to release altitude. By the time of his award, he had logged about 2,500 hours of flight time in 40 different types of fixed wing aircraft. Siebold was airlifted to the hospital on Friday, was heading to surgery on Saturday afternoon in California.","Peter Siebold, who was named today as injured pilot, is 'alert' in hospital .

"One of the most famous child actors from the 1980s has opened up about sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of older men in Hollywood and how his friendship with Michael Jackson was the healthiest relationship he had. In a new book, Coreyography, Corey Feldman, from hit movies 'Stand By Me,' 'The Lost Boys,' 'Gremlins' and 'The Goonies,' recalls his often twisted friendship with fellow child star Corey Haim and how the pair were told by trusted adults that it was normal for older men and young boys to have sexual relations in the industry. Feldman explains his family life wasn't happy: his former Playboy model mother dyed his hair blonde at age four and tortured him about his weight, force-feeding him diet pills. Meanwhile, his father only seemed to care about him when they were getting high together, he writes. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Corey Feldman, center, has opened up about the sexual abuse he and fellow child actor Corey Haim, left, suffered in Hollywood . By the age of seven, Feldman was the family breadwinner, working as a commercial actor, and his mother banned him from riding a bicycle because she said he couldn't afford to get hurt. 'You have responsibilities now,' she said, according to excerpts of the book in The New York Post. When he began acting out on the set, and was fired from one TV movie, his mother was furious. '""How could you f****** do this to me?"" she screams. She is out of control, wild-eyed, like an animal. Her face is bright red and blotchy, her cheeks are streaked with mascara,' he recalls. '""You know I need this f****** money. I will kill you. I will f****** kill you, you worthless piece of s***.""' Naturally, he sought out adult role models at work. And while Steven Spielberg, who hired him for the first time for 'Gremlins,' became a trusted friend, other grown ups took advantage of him, he writes in the book. An assistant his father, who managed him for a time, hired called 'Ron' took him out on the town as a teenager and introduced him on to new drugs. Memoir: In a new book, Coreyography, pictured, Corey Feldman, from hit movies 'Stand By Me,' 'The Lost Boys,' 'Gremlins' and 'The Goonies,' recalls being told by trusted adults that it was normal for older men and young boys to have sexual relations in the industry . One night, after taking a cocktail of pills 'Ron had made up,' the man, in his early 20s, placed a hand on Feldman's thigh. Ron ended up having oral sex with the 'petrified' and 'revolted' Feldman that night, the teen too frightened to say no. His . relationship with Ron lasted several years but Feldman also formed relationships . with other adults who reached out during this time. Sadly, these men, in many instances, turned out to be pedophiles. One picture in the book shows Feldman and Haim at the former's 15th birthday party flanked by five older men who at the time were abusing them. 'Slowly, over a period of many years I would begin to realize that many of the people I had surrounded myself with were monsters,' he writes. Interestingly, the only safe place he knew was with Michael Jackson. 'I was shattered, disgusted, devastated. I needed some normalcy in my life. So, I called Michael Jackson,' he recalls. The pair had been introduced by Spielberg. 'Michael Jackson's world, crazy as it sounds, had become my happy place. Being with Michael brought me back to my innocence. When I was with Michael, it was like being 10 years old again.' He insists in the book that Jackson never abused him or tried to touch him sexually. Death: Corey Feldman, left, and Corey Haim, right, starred in a TV series called 'The Two Coreys' in 2007 before Haim tragically died in 2010 following a long battle with drug addiction . During their first meeting, on the film 'The Lost Boys,' Haim confided in his new friend that on the set of the 1986 film 'Lucas,' 'an adult male convinced him that it was perfectly normal for older men and younger boys in the business to have sexual relations, that it was what all the guys do. So they walked off to a secluded area between two trailers... and Haim (was) sodomized.' The friends made nine films and starred in one TV series together and partied heavily, their increasingly damaging antics driven by the horrors of their abuse. After discovering his mother's stash of cocaine, Feldman's developed a dependance on drugs. He found himself snorting an eighth of an ounce every two days and bales of weed in his trailer. He recalled having 'regular coke-off challenges' with friends. Later he moved onto heroin. Haim was even more dependent. With his career all but over, Haim relapsed several times before dying of pneumonia in 2010 aged just 38. Feldman relapsed in 1995 but he said since then he's been clean. He now works on low budget horror films and has a 9-year-old son with ex-wife Playboy model Susie Sprague. But Feldman is adamant he will not be encouraging his son to follow him into child acting. 'People always ask me about life after childhood stardom. What would I say to parents of children in the industry?' he writes. 'My only advice, honestly, is to get these kids out of Hollywood and let them lead normal lives.'","Corey Feldman starred in hit movies 'Stand By Me,' 'The Lost Boys,' 'Gremlins' and 'The Goonies,'

"A Brooklyn man who has spent the past 29 years in prison for murder is expected to walk free on Wednesday. David McCallum, together with co-defendant Willie Stuckey, were found guilty of kidnapping and shooting Nathan Blenner, 20, in a Bushwick park in October 1985. The two 16-year-olds were sentenced to 25 years to life behind bars the next year. Stuckey died in prison in 2001, but McCallum has had his innocence championed by late boxer Rubin ‘Hurricane’ Carter, who served 19 years in prison after he was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1966. David McCallum, who was just 16 when he was found guilty of kidnapping and shooting a man in 1985, is expected to have his conviction overturned by a New York judge on Wednesday . Just two months before Carter died in April he wrote an op-ed for the New York Daily News in which he called for Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson to review McCallum's case. ‘My single regret in life is that David McCallum... is still in prison,’ Carter wrote. ‘Knowing what I do, I am certain that when the facts are brought to light, Thompson will recommend his immediate release.’ Lawyers for McCallum, now 45, wrote Thompson a letter in January arguing that neither DNA nor handprints found at the scene of the crime matched those of McCallum or Stuckey. The convictions were dependent on their confessions, which the suspects, then both 16, immediately recanted. Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, the boxer whose wrongful murder conviction became an international symbol of racial injustice, died aged 76 in April (2003 file photo) In 2012, McCallum told a parole board; 'I was beaten by the officers and I was coerced into making a confession.' 'At no time then or since has a single piece of forensic evidence — or evidence of any kind — ever tied McCallum or Stuckey to the crime,' wrote lawyer Oscar Michelen, who has represented McCallum pro bono for the past nine years, in his letter to Thompson. On Tuesday night, Thompson agreed that the confessions were false. 'We've concluded that the confessions were false, and they were false in large part because these 16-year-olds were fed false facts,' he said. No other evidence tied the two to the abduction or killing. McCallum greeted the news that he could be released as soon as Wednesday with 'disbelief, combined with just utter joy' when his lawyers phoned him Tuesday in prison, Michelen said. Prosecutors will ask Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Matthew D’Emic to overturn McCallum’s and Stuckey’s convictions. Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, left, poses with actor Denzel Washington at the premier of the film The Hurricane in Los Angeles in December, 1999 . Their cases were reviewed by the Brooklyn DA’s conviction-review unit, which has already overturned eight murder cases since Thompson took office in January. Carter was wrongly convicted and locked up for 19 years for a triple murder in New Jersey, a legal battle that inspired the Bob Dylan song Hurricane and a Denzel Washington movie. After being freed he became involved with advocating for other victims of injustice and first got involved with McCallum’s case in 2004. McCallum's case has also been the subject of the documentary David & Me by filmmaker Ray Klonsky, which debuted in June.","David McCallum, who was found guilty of kidnapping and shooting a man in 1985, is due to have his conviction overturned on Wednesday .

"A star-struck grandmother has revealed how she drives around with a life-sized doll of Sir Cliff Richard in her car - to scare off criminals. Jill Stolworthy, from Norwich in Norfolk, has been a huge fan of the star - who sang double chart-topper Living Doll - after first seeing him perform 55 years ago when she was just 13. The 68-year-old and her husband David, 71, drive everywhere with the bizarre dummy belted into the back seat of their Peugeot 206. Scroll down for video . Star-struck grandmother Jill Stolworthy (pictured with her husband David) drives around with a life-sized dummy of Sir Cliff Richard . Jill Stolworthy and her husband David found the bizarre head dummy at a car boot sale and attached it to  body made of MDF . The couple snapped up the pop star's head at a car boot sale in 2012 before giving him a body made from MDF with a cushion 'to give him a bit of chest'. They then used one of Mr Stolworthy's old navy blue blazers, which was destined for the charity shop, and a Norwich City football scarf to dress the doll. The model also sports a pair of aviator sunglasses - because the Stolworthys say his eyes are too intense to look at. Mr Stolworthy said: 'We got the head because we like Cliff Richard - Jill especially is a big fan - and it just escalated from there. 'We thought he would be particularly useful when Jill is driving on her own, especially at night, so it looks like there is a male passenger.' The dummy accompanies the pensioners to the shops and trips to see friends. And, fittingly, he goes on their summer holidays as well. Mrs Stolworthy has loved Sir Cliff, 73, since she was a girl and has seen him sing all over the UK. She often plays his music in the car, with his lookalike perched on the back seat and says the doll makes her feel safe when she is on her own. Living doll: Mrs Stolworthy has loved Sir Cliff Richard (pictured at Wimbledon this year) since she was a girl and has seen him sing all over the UK. She says the dummy (pictured in her car with a seat belt on) makes her feel safe when she's on her own . 'Me and my friends are all big Cliff Richard fans. I have got about 22 of his CDs and some DVDs. 'One of the old 45s we have got in the loft is from when he was in the Drifters,' she said. 'I saw him when he came to the theatre in Norwich in 1959 - I remember queuing up to get tickets and he was just fantastic that night.' Her husband added: 'We get plenty of people doing double takes when they look into the car. 'But not everyone has picked up on him. 'We recently caught the Dover to Dunkirk ferry service to go to Germany - and not once during the inspection by customs and immigration staff in either country was he spotted or commented on.' Mrs Stolworthy said the most common reaction from friends and family has been shouts of 'Are you mad?' and 'we are really worried about you two'. The Norwich City supporters have had plenty of fun with the mocked-up mannequin, scaring friends and family both in the car and around the house. 'We had him in the shed for a while, dressed in a high-visibility jacket and holding a broom - just in case anybody broke in,' said Mr Stolworthy. Mrs Stolworthy (pictured with the doll and husband David) said the most common reaction from friends and family has been shouts of 'Are you mad?' and 'we are really worried about you two' The Stolworthys have taken Cliff to friends' houses and on the 1,000 mile round-trip to Germany, where he terrified the German girlfriend of David's cousin. 'We didn't tell her he was in the car and when she got in, she shrieked,' he said. 'What she said in German, I don't know.' Another friend got a fright when she visited the house and opened the living room door. 'Our cat went up Cliff's blazer, around his head and on to the curtains,' said Mr Stolworthy. 'But it made Cliff's head move and as she came into the living room, it was as if he was lifting his head to look at her. 'She laughed really hard about it afterwards.'","Jill Stolworthy drives around with life-sized doll of Sir Cliff Richard in her car .

"Tucking into a burger alone, he gazes adoringly at a picture of a woman propped up on the table. This photo of an elderly man dining at an In-N-Out Burger restaurant in California captured hearts across the world when it was posted online by a diner last week. Now, the pensioner has revealed the woman in the picture is his beloved wife, whom he was married to for 55 years and who passed away five years ago. Heartwarming: This photo of an elderly man dining at an In-N-Out Burger restaurant alongside a photo of his late wife of 55 years captured hearts across the world when it was posted online by diners last week . The man, who has been captured eating at the fast food chain alongside photos of his late wife several times, told intrigued customers that he met his soul mate when they were both 17. They dated briefly, before losing contact when he went off to war and her family moved away from California, according to a diner who posted an image of the pensioner on Imgur. While he was serving for his country, the man constantly thought about the woman he loved and on his return to America, decided to look for her. For the following ten years, he desperately searched for his love, refusing to date anyone else and answering claims that he was crazy with: 'I am. Crazy in love.' Not alone: The man (pictured in another photo at the In-N-Out Burger restaurant) told intrigued customers that he met his soul mate when they were both aged 17. Sadly, his beloeved wife passed away five years ago . Reduced to tears: Diner Madina Bashizaduah, from San Francisco Bay Area, posted the above photo of the pensioner alongside the caption: 'Oh my god I just died! He has a picture of his wife with him as he eats!' Finally, he visited a barber shop in California, where he discovered the barber's daughter was, in fact, the woman he had spent so long searching for. She, too, had spent the past decade searching for him, so he proposed and they wed. They then spent an amazing 55 years together. It is unknown whether they had children. Since his wife's death in 2009, the pensioner revealed he takes at least one photo of her with him everywhere and even kisses it goodnight. He also still celebrates her birthday and their anniversary.

"The woman found dead next to her husband in an Indian hotel had desperately tried to wean him off drugs, her family said last night. Alex Gaskell, a talented photographer with a first-class degree, had been vehemently against drugs all her life and was seen as the ‘salvation’ of her husband James, they said. The couple, who married last November, were found dead in a hotel in Agra, surrounded by dozens of packets of sleeping pills, anti-depressants and other strong drugs. 'The real Alex and James': Mr Gaskell kisses his wife in a photo posted on his mother's Facebook page . 'Salvation': Mrs Gaskell, pictured with James, had been vehemently against drugs all her life, said her family . The pair had been visiting the Taj Mahal and Mrs Gaskell, 24, had posted a series of exotic photos of their trip around India on Twitter and Instagram. Conversely, her husband had filled his social media sites with boasts of copious drug-taking and recipes for lethal pharmacological concoctions. His final tweet on Sunday, two days before the bodies were found, spoke of how easy it was to obtain high-strength prescription drugs from Indian doctors. Mr Gaskell, 27, who had been taking anti-depressants for years to combat mental health problems, wrote: ‘Got prescribed an anti- psychotic as a sleep aid. Some Indian doctors are insane.’ Ish Anand, the doctor who prescribed Mr Gaskell diazepam after being told he was addicted to the pills and needed a repeat prescription, said yesterday: ‘He was very well informed about the medicine and I felt he knew what he was doing.’ The couple both taught languages at Manchester International College and wanted to teach English abroad on a two-year extended-work holiday that was eventually to take them to Indonesia. Prescribed drugs: Dr Ish Anand gave Mr Gaskell diazepam after being told he was addicted to the pills . Yesterday Mrs Gaskell’s family said her husband’s drug-taking was well known and she had desperately tried to wean him off them. Her stepfather, Greg Pike, 67, told how she had been seen as her husband’s ‘salvation’ by his own family. He said: ‘James had been taking anti-depressants but it just wasn’t like Alex to do anything like that. ‘She had certainly been quite successful of late in trying to get James off them. ‘James had been taking the anti-depressants for a long time. But he may have done other things and not realised quite what he was taking.’ Mr Pike, an architect from Marple Bridge, Cheshire, added: ‘If James had been taking stuff, that’s not what Alex would have done. She had always been anti-drugs.’ India is seen as a honey pot for tourists keen to get their hands of high-strength prescription drugs not normally available in the UK. The UN has warned about the rise in prescription drug abuse in India and claimed some medicines could be lethal because they were mixed with dangerous substances. Mr Gaskell – who also had a first-class degree, in English – and his wife were discovered in their room at the Maya Hotel in Agra, on Tuesday. Police believe they died of a drugs overdose. The results of post-mortem examinations and toxicology tests have yet to be released. Mr Pike added: ‘I’ve spoken to James’s mum and she’s as puzzled as me. We just can’t understand how this has happened. She saw Alex as James’s salvation. It’s a puzzle we are all struggling to understand. It’s maybe something we will never know the answer to.’ Mr Gaskell’s mother, Ann Palmer, who runs a consultancy business in Sevenoaks, Kent, posted a photo of Mr Gaskell kissing his wife on her Facebook page, writing: ‘These are the real Alex and James.’ Tragic: Mr Gaskell – who also had a first-class degree, in English – and his wife, pictured together, were discovered in their room at the Maya Hotel in Agra, on Tuesday.  Police believe they died of a drugs overdose .","Alex and James Gaskell were found dead in a hotel in Agra, India .

"Australian military aircraft and special forces have been given the green light to fight Islamic State extremists in Iraq. Federal cabinet has approved Super Hornets to start bombing raids against Islamic State extremists in coming days, supported by 400 RAAF personnel. About 200 special forces members will train and advise Iraqi forces, but are awaiting final legal approval before deploying. It's the first time since July 2009 that the Australian Defence Force has engaged in combat in Iraq. However Prime Minister Tony Abbott declined to describe it as Australia declaring 'war', in stark contrast to the operation which began in 2003. 'I know that you'd love to have that headline, but it's not strictly accurate,' Mr Abbott told reporters in Canberra on Friday. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) and defence force chief Air Marshal Mark Binskin during a press conference at Parliament House to announce the approval of air combat operations in Iraq . F/A-18F Super Hornet aircrew head to their aircraft in preparation for departure to the Middle East from RAAF Base Amberley last week in Amberley, Australia . Six Super Hornets, a Wedgetail surveillance aircraft, a KC-30 refueller and a special forces contingent have been pre-deployed to the United Arab Emirates. The operations are in support of the legitimate government of Iraq against an insurgency, he said. 'It is a combat deployment, but it is an essentially humanitarian mission to protect the people of Iraq and ultimately the people of Australia from the murderous rage of the ISIL death cult. 'ISIL must be disrupted and degraded at home and abroad, so it is absolutely in Australia's national interests that this mission go ahead.' Mr Abbott, who previously estimated the cost at $250 million for every six months of operations, warned it would take months rather than weeks. 'But not a day longer than is absolutely necessary.' Budget cost of about $250 million every six months of operations . Aircraft greatest risk comes from IS small arms, anti-aircraft fire, portable surface to air missiles . Special forces risk comes from small arms and roadside bombs . Ability to call off, or 'red card', air strikes if not satisfied target has been clearly identified . Civilian casualties to be minimised. The RAAF will deploy six Super Hornets, a Wedgetail surveillance aircraft and a refueller. 'The team is well trained, they're well equipped, they're well prepared,' Chief of the Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said. 'We're ready to get on with the job.' Mr Abbott said the aim was to help Iraqi security forces restore government control over its towns and cities. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, who was briefed on the cabinet decision, said Labor supported the mission. 'In the face of evil, nations of good conscience do have a responsibility to act,' he said. But he recognised military action alone would not 'drain the swamp of terrorism'. RAAF aircraft set to participate in attacks on Islamic State  jihadists have conducted their first training missions in the Middle East region . 'I must warn Australians; this is a dangerous mission,' said Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Friday . This could only come through the nations of the Middle East working together to restore peace and stability and for the government of Iraq to be more representative of its people. Australia should also commit to taking in more immigrants displaced by the extremists. Greens leader Christine Milne said the operation would make Australia a greater target for terrorists and a more attractive recruiting ground. 'Why would we not be better served by a strategy to combat extremism with inclusion at home, whilst supporting global efforts to cut off financial and personnel support to ISIL?' Senator Milne said.","Federal cabinet has approved combat flights to fight IS extremists in Iraq in coming days .

"Vladimir Putin could control Europe or America if he were not so busy, according to Formula One tycoon Bernie Ecclestone. The pair, who have been seen together at recent sporting events, often defend each other’s viewpoints. But now the British billionaire has gone even further in praising Mr Putin, 62, during an interview with Russian newspaper Vedomosti. Mr Ecclestone, 83, reportedly praised the Russian president – who is widely blamed for stoking the conflict in Ukraine in recent months – saying: ‘He’s [Putin’s] a first-class person. I always supported him. Scroll down for video . Lending an ear: Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone (right) has heaped praise on Russia's Vladimir Putin (left) Eyes on the race: The pair sat in a box together at the Russian Grand Prix in the Olympic host city of Sochi . ‘He could control Europe or America; he is able to deal with it. But I think he is very busy. Let him finish what he’s doing and then we’ll see.’ The Formula One boss was spotted deep in conversation with Mr Putin in the hospitality grandstand at the Russian Grand Prix last weekend. The two men are believed to have met several times over a deal that secured the Black Sea resort of Sochi as the venue for the event, Russia's first of its kind. Moscow is reportedly paying £31million a year to Formula One, thought to be the highest ever grand prix hosting fee. It is not the first time Mr Ecclestone’s comments concerning the Russian leader have caused controversy. He previously spoke of his ‘great admiration’ for Mr Putin and said he ‘completely agrees’ with his views on homosexuality - which included advising gay athletes to stay away from children at the Winter Olympics - and said they had been misrepresented. Mr Ecclestone previously spoke of his ‘great admiration’ for Mr Putin and said he ‘completely agrees’ with his views on homosexuality - which included advising gay athletes to stay away from children in Sochi . ‘He hasn’t said he doesn’t agree [with homosexuality], just that he doesn’t want these things publicised to an audience under the age of 18,’ Mr Ecclestone told US broadcaster CNN. ‘I completely agree with those sentiments and if you took a world census you’d find 90 per cent of the world agree with it as well.’ Previously, Mr Ecclestone has expressed sympathy for Adolf Hitler and said his friend Max Mosley, the son of British fascist leader Oswald Mosley, ‘would do a super job’, as prime minister, adding: ‘I don’t think his background would be a problem.’ Despite the controversies over the crackdown on rights in Russia, and the behaviour of Russian-backed militias in the Ukraine, Mr Putin has also retained the support of some British political figures. Earlier this year, Scottish SNP leader Alex Salmond refused to apologise after he commended the Russian leader for ‘restoring a substantial part of Russian pride’ in a magazine interview. The F1 boss said: 'He could control Europe or America; he is able to deal with it. But I think he is very busy' Asked about whether he admired Mr Putin, the SNP leader said: ‘Certain aspects. He’s restored a substantial part of Russian pride and that must be a good thing. ‘There are aspects of Russian constitutionality and the intermesh with business and politics that are obviously difficult to admire. Russians are fantastic people, incidentally, they are lovely people.’ While in March, Ukip leader Nigel Farage controversially said he respected Mr Putin more than the ‘kids’ who run Britain. The Ukip leader said he did not like or trust Putin, or want to live in Russia, but claimed he was doing a better job on foreign policy than David Cameron and the foreign secretary, William Hague. At the time, Deputy PM Nick Clegg condemned support for the Russian president as ‘utterly grotesque’.","Mr Ecclestone, 83, has been seen with Russian President at sporting events .

"A notorious madam who allegedly supplied escorts to former New York governor Eliot Spitzer has condemned the 'day to day degradation' at Rikers Island and blames the conditions on her turning to prescription drugs. Kristin Davis, 38, spent four months in solitary confinement in the New York jail after she pleaded guilty to promoting prostitution during the scandal that led to the politician's resignation in 2008. After she was released, she began suffering from PTSD and started taking Xannax and Ambien, she says. She was then arrested and convicted of dealing the drugs to a friend who had become FBI informant. Scroll down for video . Terrified: Kristin Davis, 38, spent four months at the New York jail after she pleaded guilty to promoting prostitution during the scandal that led to the politician's resignation. She will go to federal prison for two years . Now, she is about to go back behind bars for up to two more years after being sentenced by a federal judge. In a post for XO Jane, she describes the squalid conditions inside the facility and the alleged mistreatment by prison guards. She explains how she was taken to the jail after she was convicted and held in solitary confinement for the majority of the time. 'I was taken to Rikers Island. I spent two days in the “intake” area in a cell meant for 10 women, however, there were 25 of us piled in like sardines,' she wrote. 'There was one toilet in the center of the room with no walls and it was full of rotten food and maggots and flies. I was not allowed a phone call, given food or a shower or a real bathroom. 'If you were able to get one of the officers' attention, they would threaten you with solitary for being disruptive. My bail was set at $2 million dollars for a first time offender. 'The officers liked to make comments about our body parts and after about 10 minutes of standing naked in our cells, they would conduct their cavity search. 'That consisted of making us bend and squat to show them our “cavities” to make sure there was no hidden contraband. Then we could get dressed and watch while they tore our cells into shreds looking for hidden items. 'You don’t have much to hold onto in jail but a few photographs and letters, and I had one officer walk over my photographs and rip them just because she could. Conditions: The notorious madam says guards would comment on body parts during 'cavity' searches and would tear up their cells during random inspections . 'The day-in-day-out degradation I experienced in Rikers Island is something you cannot imagine if you haven’t been there. I consider myself lucky to have made it through that experience. 'I got out of Rikers and was a complete mess. I had PTSD, intense panic attacks and insomnia from the solitary confinement.' It was the struggle that forced Davis to turn to prescription drugs. She said Xanax and Ambien 'became her friends' and she couldn't function without them. She was then approached by a friend, who had become an FBI informant following an arrest in 2012, who asked her whether she could give him any excess pills. Mental impact: Davis (pictured outside a Manhattan federal court in 2013) said she began suffering from PTSD when she was released from Rikers, and that is what caused her to turn to prescription pills . Davis was then arrested and although she admits to feeling 'betrayed' she has said she is responsible for her actions and deserves the consequences. She added: 'I will lose most of my possessions and be homeless when I come out. And you know what I think? I think I got what I deserved. 'My judge said some poignant words to me at sentencing. He said that he sentences many individuals who have no family and grew up in crack houses or even more unspeakable circumstances, and they simply do not know better. 'But I should have known better. Spitzer reportedly had at least seven liaisons with prostitutes from the agency over six months, and paid more than $15,000 for their services. Federal agents had him under surveillance twice in 2008. Resignation: Eliot Spitzer stepped down as the New York governor in 2008 following the escort scandal after he reportedly paid for the services of prostitutes from the Emperor's Club VIP . According to published reports, investigators believe Spitzer paid up to $80,000 for prostitutes over a period of several years. Conditions on Rikers Island have been slammed in recent months, leading a prosecutor to threaten legal action in order to push through meaningful reforms. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara issued a statement after The New York Times reported that a confidential report showed that the city omitted hundreds of inmate fights from statistics turned over to federal authorities investigating possible civil rights violations. The newspaper also said the jail supervisors involved in the report had been promoted.

"Visitors to one of the country’s leading theatres are faking disability in order to get free tickets to watch shows, bosses claimed yesterday. Currently the Grand Opera House in Belfast allows disabled people who pay to see a production to bring a carer along with them for no extra charge. But managers suspect that some of the 1,200 customers who signed up to the scheme since it was launched two years ago are perfectly able-bodied and are simply exploiting it for cut-price access to shows. Managers in the Grand Opera House in Belfast brought in the scheme to attract more disabled theatre-goers . In the last 12 months the venue issued in excess of 3,000 free tickets for carers. Now it has emerged that theatre managers have written to all members who joined the scheme announcing a ‘review’ – which is likely to involve introducing a requirement to provide medical evidence of disability. The opera house – which hosted Luciano Pavarotti’s UK debut in 1963 – introduced the scheme to attract more disabled theatre-goers who would otherwise have had to buy two tickets so they could have someone to help them on the night. The letter states: ‘The uptake of this option has been hugely successful, but unfortunately there is evidence that this aspect of the membership scheme is being misused and seen as an opportunity to avail of free tickets. ‘Unfortunately for this reason we will be reviewing the scheme and introducing some changes in the New Year. ‘It is very disappointing to have to make any changes to the services we offer our customers, but regrettably, we have to ensure that the scheme is fit for purpose, meets the needs of those people who need it most as well as making sure that it remains a viable option of reasonable adjustment for the Grand Opera House.’ The staff will decide what checks will be carried out to detect fakers by working with NI Equality Commission . The review will be carried out by the theatre’s disability advisory group working with the Northern Irish Equality Commission before it announces what checks will be carried out to detect fakers. However the letter is likely to be seen as a warning to anyone exploiting the scheme by posing as disabled that they will no longer be able to get away with their scam. A spokeswoman for the theatre stressed that the move was intended to help genuine disabled people by ensuring the theatre could continue to offer them a free ticket for a carer. ‘The scheme has been hugely successful in the last two years, and we hope that access for the most disadvantaged members of our community continues in the future,’ said chief executive Mary-Clare Deane. ‘We will continue to liaise with the Equality Commission for NI and our in house Disability Advisory Group to ensure that we maximize this access for those with disabilities and will be monitoring the use of the scheme in the New Year before introducing any changes.’ Founded in 1895, the Grand Opera House has hosted acts including Gracie Fields, George Formby and Laurel and Hardy. In 1963, Luciano Pavarotti – then an unknown Italian singer - made his UK debut there in the role of Lieutenant Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly. Last year Disneyland in Florida stopped allowing disabled visitors to jump queues amid claims that families of able-bodied tourists had been exploiting the concession by paying hundreds of dollars to self-proclaimed ‘tour guides’ in wheelchairs in return for accompanying them. In order to curb abuse, disabled visitors were instead to be given tickets with a specified entry time that would still be earlier than if they had joined the queue, Mail Online reported.","Grand Opera House in Belfast allows disabled to bring carer free of charge .

"Adding to signs of distress in the nuclear force, the Air Force fired two commanders and disciplined a third yesterday. The action was a response to internal investigations of leadership lapses and misbehavior at two of its three intercontinental ballistic missile bases. The most senior officer to be relieved was Col. Carl Jones, the No. 2 commander of the 90th Missile Wing at F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming, in charge of 150 of the Air Force's 450 Minuteman 3 nuclear ICBMs. Scroll down for video . Col. Carl Jones (pictured left) was relieved from his duties in Wyoming, Col. Richard Pagliuco (pictured right) received administrative punishmen . He was dismissed 'for a loss of trust and confidence in his leadership abilities,' and has been reassigned as a special assistant to the wing commander. The actions on Monday were confirmed to The Associated Press in response to an AP inquiry about an internal Air Force investigation of two commanders at the 91st Missile Wing at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, which also is responsible for 150 Minuteman 3 missiles. A separate investigation was conducted at F.E. Warren. The Air Force nuclear missile corps has suffered a rash of recent setbacks, including the firing last year of its top commander and a number of security lapses. It is unusual for disciplinary action to be taken against senior officers at two of the Air Force's three nuclear missile bases on the same day. Officials said the timing was a coincidence. It extends a pattern of leadership failures in the ICBM force over the past year. Last March nine officers were fired at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana, which is the third of the three nuclear missile bases, in response to an exam-cheating scandal there. On the same day as that announcement, the 90th Missile Wing at F.E. Warren disclosed that it had fired Col. David Holloway, the officer in charge of the three missile squadrons there. It has never fully explained that action. Last year, Maj. Gen. Michael Carey, commander of the entire ICBM force, was fired after an investigation into a drinking binge and other misconduct while he was in Russia as head of a visiting U.S. government delegation. The nuclear missile force, whose work is arguably the most sensitive in the military, has been beset with problems in discipline, training, leadership and morale, prompting Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in February to order an independent review. The results of that review are expected to be announced in coming weeks. In response to an AP inquiry Monday, Lt. Col. John Sheets, spokesman for Air Force Global Strike Command, which is in charge of the Air Force Minuteman 3 force as well as its nuclear bomber fleet, said that as a result of the Minot investigation a missile squadron commander, Lt. Col. Jimmy 'Keith' Brown, was relieved of command Monday 'because of a loss of confidence in Brown's ability to lead his squadron.' An ICBM launch site located among fields and farms in the countryside outside Minot, N.D.  is pictured . Sheets said the investigation was directed by Maj. Gen. Jack Weinstein, commander of the 20th Air Force, and 'substantiated that Brown engaged in unlawful discrimination or harassment.' He added that the probe found that Brown 'made statements to subordinates that created a perception within his squadron that pregnancy would negatively affect a woman's career.' The probe also substantiated allegations that Brown had failed to ensure the well-being of his troops. In March a two-person crew operating a Minuteman 3 launch control center at Minot felt ill from fumes created by a refurbishment project, but the crew remained at their post because they believed Brown would have taken action against them had they left. They later were hospitalized, Sheets said. There are three missile squadrons at each of the three nuclear missile wings. Each squadron is responsible for 50 missiles operated by officers in five underground launch control centers. The second officer targeted in the Minot investigation was Col. Richard Pagliuco, commander of the 91st Operations Group, which is in charge of the three missile squadrons at Minot, including Brown's. Sheets said the investigation confirmed that Pagliuco 'failed to promote and safeguard the morale, well-being and welfare of the airmen under his command.' Pagliuco received administrative punishment in the form of a letter in his personnel file, but Sheets said he could not be more specific about the punishment. The complaints against Jones, the vice commander of the 90th Missile Wing at F.E. Warren, were the most extensive, according to Sheets' description of the case. Sheets said Jones' immediate superior, Col. Tracey Hayes, commander of the 90th, removed him following an internal investigation that substantiated allegations of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, and cruelty and maltreatment of a subordinate. 'In four separate instances, Jones acted in a manner that degraded his status as a senior officer and wing leader including maltreating a subordinate,' Sheets said. The most recent incident involving Jones was in September and occurred at a thrift store operated on F.E. Warren by volunteers, Sheets said. According to the investigation report as described by Sheets, Jones went to the shop, called Airman's Attic, to discuss shopping hour policies. 'He hit the sign on the Airman's Attic door and repeatedly hit the shop's front counter while raising his voice, using profanity' and threatening to shut down the place, Sheets said. It was this incident which prompted a complaint to the 90th Missile Wing's inspector general, leading to the investigation and the decision by Hayes to remove Jones. Three other incidents of allegedly inappropriate behavior on base by Jones during 2014 were substantiated in the investigation, including one in May in which his behavior was described by one officer and a witness as shocking. Sheets said the disciplinary actions at Minot and Warren reflect an effort to ensure that commanders do not behave in ways that detract from the mission. 'Our people must treat each other with dignity and respect,' Sheets said. 'That applies up and down the chain of command.'","Col. Carl Jones, the No. 2 commander of the 90th Missile Wing at F.E.

"Nick Bonnie and his girlfriend Leah Wilkins. Four friends charged over his death have walked free from court . The distraught mother of a Prince’s Trust worker who died after taking ecstasy on a night out with four friends said her family was irreparably ‘broken’ today as she watched them spared jail for lying to police about the tragedy. Nick Bonnie, 30, who had been pictured with the Prince of Wales and visited Highgrove and Buckingham Palace through his work with the charity, collapsed after taking the drug while the quintet were enjoying a ‘lads’ weekend’. As his friends took a taxi to the hospital where he lay dying, they agreed to lie to police about who had supplied the drugs, each sticking to their story as they were questioned while he suffered a fatal heart attack in intensive care. When they appeared in court yesterday, Mr Bonnie’s mother – who herself works in drugs rehabilitation – movingly addressed the judge about how the family’s lives would never be the same again after the loss of ‘our beloved, beautiful son’. And Pauline Bonnie hit out at how his friends’ lies had caused them ‘additional anguish and unacceptable stress’ by prolonging their ordeal for more than a year. She said: ‘In the early hours of September 28 we were told our beloved, beautiful son, brother and partner had died,’ she said. ‘A part of us has died and our lives will never be the same without Nick. Scroll down for video. Dean Neale left Minshull Street Crown Court having been sentenced to eight months' jail suspended . Guilty men: Paul Tabb (left) and James Churchill (right) walked free from court having received suspended sentences of eight and 12 months' imprisonment respectively . Simon Lloyd-Jones pictured leaving court today was also given eight months' jail after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice, and again his sentence was suspended . ‘We all feel cheated at not being able to see and celebrate Nick marry Leah and have children, and the bright future at The Prince’s Trust that he will never have.’ She added that his friends’ ‘lies’ had caused ‘additional anguish and unacceptable stress’ by delaying an inquest that would have enabled them to grieve properly. ‘Every day for us feels like a mountain to climb,’ she concluded. ‘We are a broken family and we will never get over this. ‘We have lost our sparkle until the day we leave this world.’ Mr Bonnie and Leah Wilkins (left) at a party alongside his brothers Thomas and Ryan and their girlfriends . Mr Bonnie and his friends, Dean Neale, now 30, Paul Tabb, 31, James Churchill, 31, and Simon Lloyd-Jones, 29, had driven up from their homes around Stroud, Gloucestershire in September last year for a night at the Warehouse Project nightclub in Manchester. On the way, with the exception of site engineer Lloyd-Jones, who abstained throughout, they took cocaine and ecstasy that Churchill – who owns a gym - had agreed to buy ahead of the trip, and their excitement is plain in photographs as they prepared to set off from the apartment they were renting. But they became separated from Bonnie over the course of the night, Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester was told yesterday, assuming he had gone back to their room early. Nick Bonnie (far right, in white T-shirt with red lanyard) with the Prince of Wales . In reality, he had been found unconscious in the courtyard area by security staff and taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary by ambulance. By the time the quartet was traced, they were back at their accommodation, and immediately took a taxi to be with him, Rob Hall, prosecuting, said, agreeing en route to tell police they had bought the drugs from someone in the club rather than reveal the truth. ‘It may be the view of those who listen that the most obvious motive was to protect Mr Churchill, who clearly was at risk,’ he added. Nick Bonnie died after taking ecstasy at The Warehouse Project in Manchester (above) Mr Bonnie, who was otherwise healthy, died at around 5am from a heart attack caused by ‘excessive consumption of ecstasy’, a post mortem examination revealed. As a result, police resources were diverted to putting out alerts about a possibly fatal ‘bad batch’ of drugs circulating around the club when in reality the group had brought them from their home county. It was only when Mr Bonnie’s mobile phone was examined two months later that messages they had exchanged on the WhatsApp social media platform in the run-up to the fateful weekend revealed Churchill had been nominated to supply the drugs, and they were all arrested. At their sentencing hearing yesterday, they stared straight ahead or at the ground as Mr Bonnie’s mother stood in the witness box and read out sections of her victim impact statement, as his girlfriend Leah Wilkins and other relatives wept in the public gallery. Nick Bonnie, on a previous night out, was otherwise healthy. He died at around 5am from a heart attack caused by ‘excessive consumption of ecstasy’, a post mortem examination revealed . Barristers for the four men, who all arrived in suits and carrying hold-alls in preparation for prison, argued that they had been deeply affected by the loss of their friend and that a lie which began while all were suffering from the effects of drink or drugs had ‘snowballed’. Judge Jeffrey Lewis described all five as ‘decent, hard-working young men’, all but one of whom had decided to ‘boost’ their enjoyment of a ‘lads’ weekend’ by taking drugs. ‘Activity of this kind is sometimes described as recreational use of drugs as if such activity were perfectly acceptable and legitimate,’ he said. ‘Quite the reverse – it’s criminal.’ He added that while what they had done may be ‘fashionable’, it was not only illegal, but it could have a profound impact, including ‘from time to time, as occurred on this occasion, with fatal consequences.’ He said they had failed in their duty to their friend to tell the truth about what had happened, but accepted that all had ‘excellent’ work records and were genuinely remorseful, agreeing to suspend their prison sentences. Churchill, who admitted supplying ecstasy and cocaine, and perverting the course of justice, was given 12 months suspended for 18 months. Tabb and Neale - an operations manager for a manufacturing firm - were given eight months after admitting possessing ecstasy and cocaine, and perverting the course of justice, while Lloyd-Jones was also given eight months after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice, also suspended. The four defendants, who are all from Stroud, were also ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work in the community. Afterwards Detective Inspector Carl Gilbert, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘This is a very sad case – it’s five lads who’ve travelled to Manchester for an enjoyable night out, and they’re left with one of them dead and the other four in court because of the consequences of one poor choice.’ ‘To all those who heard on the National news on Saturday 28th September 2013, a 30 year old man from Gloucestershire had lost his life in a Manchester nightclub after taking illicit substances - this was our son, local boy, young man, Nick Bonnie. ‘We don't want to have any obituary or such like printed but have decided that his life was too precious and important to go unreported. 'Everyone who knew Nick was aware he loved life' ‘He played local football for Kings Stanley Youth teams up until the age of 16, Leonard Stanley Under 18s, Brimscombe &Thrupp and finally Cashes Green. Nick was a keen sportsman, avid follower of Liverpool AFC and only last week completed the ‘Tough Mudder’ challenge for Help the Heroes in Wales. Nick was known by many as having a big heart, big personality and the most infectious smile in Stroud. ‘Nick Bonnie lost his life tragically, senselessly and needlessly in a nightclub in Manchester on a lads' weekend. This has devastated the lives of us, his parents, his two brothers Thomas and Ryan, and his beautiful and devoted girlfriend, Leah. Our family and friends, Nick's friends, work colleagues and all those who had the privilege of knowing him and those he helped in his employment at the Princes Trust. ‘Nick was born in King's Stanley and went to the local primary school. He progressed to Marling before taking a gap year and travelling around Australia before gaining his degree at University in Plymouth. 'He returned home to work with a local firm of solicitors in Stroud before embarking on the true vocation of his life, working at the Princes Trust. He has helped many young people in the early stages of his employment with them and helped raise funds and promote the profile of the Trust in his current role. He has been to Highgrove on several occasions and attended one of the Queen's garden parties at Buckingham Palace. ‘Everyone who knew Nick was aware he loved life, lived it to the max and in making one stupid mistake he has cost himself his life. ‘We hope that after reading this, we may have gone some way in helping anyone/ everyone in the realisation that drinking and use of any illicit drugs are a killer with consequences that will devastate lives for ever. ‘Our thanks go to all those who have taken to time to send messages of support to out family. Our lives and all those who were blessed to share a part of his are broken. Our life will never be the same without Nick and he will never be forgotten.’","Nick Bonnie, 30, died of heart attack caused by ‘excessive consumption of ecstasy’

"Donald McNicol, 54, was beaten to death when he refused to give up his seat at the community centre . A gang of youths who savagely beat a father-of-two to death when he refused to give up his seat at a community centre computer have been jailed for a total of 37 years. Donald McNicol, 54, refused to be intimidated by the four youths who targeted him when he used a computer to look for engineering jobs at the community centre. One of the gang started an argument with Mr McNicol and the rest then viciously attacked him in a 'gratuitous and uncontrolled' assault lasting just 45 seconds. During the onslaught, Zimbabwean-born Mr McNicol, who was described as 'quiet and good natured', had a chair thrown at him and was repeatedly punched, leaving him crumpled on the floor with blood all over his face. He suffered a serious brain injury and died in hospital two weeks later. Monsur Rahman, 19, his brother Mamunoor Rahman, 18 and Daniel Okello, 20, were found guilty of murder, following a trial at the Old Bailey. And 17-year-old Ibrahim Ford was convicted of manslaughter. Today, Judge John Bevan ordered the Rahman brothers to be detained for at least 11 years and Okello for a minimum of 10 years and six months. Ford was told to serve five and a half years. To the three defendants who were convicted of murder, he said: 'I am conscious that this was entirely unpremeditated and there was no intention to kill but it was a gratuitous uncontrolled attack to the head of a defenceless victim.' He told them he was imposing the shortest sentence possible in the hope that they can eventually turn their lives around an 'do something positive' to repair the damage they had done. To Okello, whose mother turned him in to police after he confessed to her what he had done, the judge said: 'I feel very sorry for your mother for the appalling bind you have put her in. I only hope you feel the same.' Mr McNicol's family were tearful as they saw his killers being sent down from the dock. Brothers Mamunoor Rahman (left), 18, Monsur Rahman (right), 19 were found guilty of murder and sentenced to at least 11 years in prison . Daniel Okello, 20, (left) was found guilty of murder and sentenced to a minimum of 10 years and six months. Ibrahim Ford, 17 (far right) was convicted of manslaughter and told to serve five and a half years . The brutal attack took place on December 2 last year at Stockwell Park Community Centre in south-west London. Opening the case, prosecutor Sarah Whitehouse QC had said: 'Monsur Rahman told Donald McNicol to get off the computer terminal as he wanted to use it himself. 'Mr McNicol was not to be so easily dislodged and he refused - telling Monsur Rahman that he would have to wait his turn. Monsur Rahman was not, however, going to give way peacefully and the exchange became more heated. 'He persistently demanded they go outside to sort it out.' Monsur Rahman then rolled his chair in to Mr McNicol before squaring up to him. 'Within seconds the rest of the group joined in and attacked Mr McNicol, punching him to the head,' Miss Whitehouse said. 'He turned against the wall to protect his face but the blows kept coming. It was a vicious onslaught and out of all proportion to any threat that as posed by Mr McNicol. 'Finally, one of the group, Mamunoor Rahman, picked up a chair and brought it crashing down on Mr McNicol's head, and then continued to punch Mr McNicol. 'The whole incident had taken about 45 seconds, perhaps a minute. It was very, very quick.' Mr McNicol was beaten to death at the Stockwell Park community centre while searching for jobs online . All the defendants had denied murder but Mamunoor Rahman pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of manslaughter having admitted assaulting Mr McNicol with a chair. Meanwhile, Okello admitted landing a single punch and the others denied having anything at all to do with the fatal attack. After the convictions, Scotland Yard's Detective Chief Inspector Tim Duffield said: 'Mr McNicol was sitting quietly at a desk when this group singled him out and launched a most vicious and cowardly attack. Their actions were completely inexcusable.' The Stockwell Park Community Centre was a pioneering project formed in 1994 in response to a high crime rate, a demoralised and demotivated community and poor housing management. Former Labour prime minister Tony Blair visited the centre on the campaign trail in 1997 and a year later it became one of the first charities in London to offer free internet access.","Four youths beat Donald McNicol to death at Stockwell Park community hub .

"A man whose photo went viral earlier this month after he allegedly groped a woman in Seattle has now been charged with assault. The city attorney's office said Thursday that Daryl R. Sharma, 36, of Kirkland was charged with one count of assault with sexual motivation, a gross misdemeanor, in the October 12 incident in downtown Seattle. The city is asking that bail be set at $50,000 at his arraignment Friday in a King County Jail courtroom. Getting his just desserts: Daryl Sharma, 36, a man with a long history of groping, has been charged with assault with sexual motivation in connection to an October 12 incident in Seattle . Allegations: Julia Marquand, 28, took a handful of photos of known sex-offender Daryl Sharma, who walked up beside her on a sidewalk near Westlake Park in the city and supposedly touched her inappropriately . The groping incident might have gone unreported, but the woman, 28-year-old Julia Marquand, snapped his picture . She publicized it on Twitter because she felt a police officer didn't take her complaint seriously. Marquand took a handful of photos of known sex offender Daryl Sharma, who walked up beside her on a sidewalk near Westlake Park in broad daylight October 12 and supposedly touched her inappropriately. After he tried to calmly walk away from the scene, Marquand followed him and took a collection of snaps on her cellphone. In response, he tried to apologize in what she believed was 'damage control'. She told Q13 Fox: 'I know the difference between being bumped into and being groped. I pulled out my phone and I just started snapping pictures.' Marquand contacted the police who recognized him as being under Department of Corrections supervision. However, officers would not take her images as evidence. But when she uploaded the photos, the response changed the course of the investigation. According to Seattle police, over the past 10 days, they have been flooded with more than a dozen reports made by women accusing Sharma of touching them inappropriately. On Thursday, Ms Marquand told The Seattle Times she felt a sense of 'relief' upon learning that Sharma has been charged. Relieved: Marquand was glad to hear that her alleged assailant has been charged . Frustration: Marquand handed police the photos of Sharma, but they did not want to use them as evidence . 'I don't want this to happen anymore,' she told the paper. The 28-year-old woman said that the takeaway from this incident is that police should not be dismissive of groping complaints going forward. ‘I think they know they are on watch now, they are aware if they don’t perform their duties correctly people are going to do something about it,’ she said. The Seattle Police Department acknowledged Marquand's frustration and  confirmed a detective was contacted by DOC officers after they recognized the man in photos the victim circulated on Twitter. Sharma is said to have a long history of groping and is a Level 3 sex offender - meaning he is most likely to re-offend. In 2012, he was sentenced to 20 months in jail for grabbing a woman's breast on a bench at Seattle's University Village. He was convicted twice in 2003 on assault charges related to rubbing himself against a woman and groping her breast, and later grabbing another woman’s behind. A year earlier, the man was accused of approaching a woman and running his hand through her hair and down her face while making kissing sounds and sexual comments. After his actions were noticed on Twitter, Sharma was taken back into custody at the King County Jail  October 15 for allegedly violating the conditions of his supervised release. Unsettling: Sharma, pictured here holding a child in 2010, served 20 months in jail beginning in 2012 for grabbing a woman's breast . Serial offender: Sharma is said to have a history of groping and following Marquand's tweet, she claims 200 people have come forward with allegations the same man has groped them . A statement from Seattle PD read: 'SPD Sexual Assault detectives and Department of Corrections (DOC) officers have identified a person of interest in a weekend assault on a woman in downtown Seattle. 'This person of interest is currently being held at the King County Jail for a violation of his DOC supervision. 'Police began investigating the incident after a woman contacted an officer at the West Precinct on October 12th to report a man groped the woman as she walked down the street near Westlake Park. 'The victim photographed the man before contacting police at the West Precinct. 'A West Precinct officer documented the incident, including a detailed description of the suspect, but did not collect the victim's photograph of the suspect at the time of the report. 'The victim, understandably frustrated by the incident, pro-actively circulated a photo of the man via social media, along with an account of her experience reporting the incident. 'DOC officers contacted SPD detectives about the case after recognizing the man in the photo as a level III sex offender on DOC supervision. 'Police are still investigating the case, but are working to confirm a connection between the man identified by DOC officers and the Westlake incident.; .","Daryl Sharma, 36, charged with assault with sexual motivation, a gross misdemeanor .

"Vinod Khosla, 59, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems, was forced to allow members of the public to use the beach next to his $37million California home after losing a year-long legal battle . A Silicon Valley billionaire who blocked access to a popular beach next to his $37million home has lost a legal battle against a group of surfers, forcing him to re-open it to the public. Vinod Khosla, 59, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems who is worth around $1.5billion, bought the luxury property and adjoining road that leads to Martin's Beach in San Mateo County, California, in 2008. The previous owner had allowed visitors to get onto the stretch of sand for $5, but the father-of-three decided against it. He locked the gate at the entrance to the access road and even hired guards to keep people away. But yesterday a judge ruled that blocking the road was illegal and he required a permit from the Coastal Commission. The Surfrider Foundation started legal proceedings against the businessman a year ago, arguing that Mr Khosla should be forced to pay the maximum fine of $15,000 a day - which would amount to around $20million. They have been campaigning on behalf of at least 100 people who have been arrested for 'trespassing' on the beach, according to court documents. The technology mogul's attorneys argued that the Coastal Commission was a 'runaway' body and his Fifth Amendment property rights. Mr Khosla, who owns the road but not the beach itself, claimed he simply wanted to establish that he cannot be forced to allow people on his property. Judge Barbara Mallach of the San Mateo County Superior Court ruled against him, stating that closing the gate to the road was illegal. She said that Mr Khosla, who owns the land via limited liability corporations, should stop preventing the public from accessing and using the water, beach and coast at Martin's Beach until a resolution of his permit application has been reached by San Mateo County or the Coastal Commission. 'Today's decision is a huge victory for all of the people of California,' Joe Cotchett, the attorney representing Surfrider told NBC. 'It affirms that great wealth cannot be used to circumvent and ignore the law. Everyone can again visit Martin's Beach.' Khosla and his attorney released a statement Wednesday afternoon expressing disappointment in the court ruling. They added that they will consider their options for an appeal - meaning litigation could still go on for years. Mr Kholsa locked the gate leading to the popular Martin's Beach in San Mateo County, California, in 2008. The previous owner had allowed people to get onto the beach for $5 . The Surfrider Foundation has been campaigning for the beach to be reopened to the public and began legal proceedings against the technology mogul a year ago . He was however not required to pay any fines. The beach is about 35 miles south of San Francisco and is a favourite with surfers for its great waves. In California, unlike in many other states, all beaches are open to the public under the constitution. But private landowners are not always required to allow access to the coastline across their properties. Last year the Surfrider Foundation, a coastal protection group, filed the lawsuit to open access to Martin's Beach, arguing that closing the approach amounted to a violation of the state's Coastal Act, which governs issues including shoreline access. But Mr Khosla, a father of three, who owns the land via limited liability corporations, had closed off the access road and hired guards to keep people out.

"Some 850 people living in the city of New York are 'officially' over the age of 164, according to Board of Elections records that list all their birth dates as 1 January 1850. Officials discovered that hundreds of residents were the implausible age when they were alerted to a quirk in the system left over from a 'bygone era'. They explained that  previous practices allowed residents not to provide their exact birthdays when registering to vote - and 1 January 1850 is the default date for those whose birth dates were unknown or unclear. Previous practices meant that residents in New York did not have to provide their exact birth date when registering to vote in the city - and this has led to some rather confusing ages being listed on official records . Some of the new voters, mostly women, simply wrote that they were '21+' - above the legal voting age -  when registering to vote, the New York Post reported. 'It's a left-over vestige from a bygone era,' Board of Elections executive director Mike Ryan told the newspaper. 'They were all listed as age 164. This was no accident. It's a little quirk in the system. It's not widespread,' he added, noting there are more than four million registered voters. The bizarre discovery came after the Post reported on the case of 73-year-old Luz Pabellon who was listed on her official voter registration card as 'AGE: 164'. 850 residents were given birth dates that would mean they were alive in the days when Abraham Lincoln was president of the United States . Ms Pabellon, who lives in the Bronx, was in fact born on 14 February 1941. 'That's not me! I don't know why they did that!,' she told the newspaper, when alerted to her 'official' age. 'That's very strange. I've been voting for many years,' she added - just not in the 1800s. Then this week, a search of the records in all five boroughs of New York found 849 more voters with the same implausible birth date as Ms Pabellon - meaning the city supposedly has a total of 850 voters who were alive when Abraham Lincoln was president. The elections board explained that it switched to computerized databases in 1999 and 2006, and twice sent out notices imploring the 164-year-olds to provide their real birth dates. But since most of them ignored the requests - and to comply with state rules election officials were required to write in a specific date of birth for all voters or remove them from the rolls - the birth date 1 January 1850 continued to be used. New Yorkers who registered after 2006 were required to provide their true birth dates. As the rules now stand, a voter without a date of birth who shows up on Election Day will not be in the register, and will be declared ineligible to vote. But the fake birth dates have caused some concern about the potential for fraud. 'This is crazy. It's insane,' William Russell Moore, who challenged Bronx Assemblyman Marcos Crespo in the Democratic primary, told the Post. 'The Board of Elections is very inept. How many people are they doing this to? This is the type of inattention that allows fraud to take place.' At a meeting yesterday, Board of Election commissioners and Mr Ryan discussed ways to fix the issue, including sending out another letter requesting the real dates of birth and having staffers undertake the lengthy task of trying to contact the 850 by phone. Mr Ryan said the matter will be revisited after the November 4 election.","A quirk in the system  has given hundreds of residents the impossible age .

"A girl with cerebral palsy has learned to talk, walk and play by copying her healthy twin sister, her parents claim. Four-year-old Felicity Williams has cerebral palsy, which causes movement problems as well as communication and learning difficulties. But thanks to copying her twin sister, Tiffany, she has managed to surprise her parents with her progress. Scroll down for video. Felicity Williams, four (left) has astonished parents Gary, 28, and Hayley, 27, by learning to walk and talk - by copying her twin sister Tiffany (right) Tiffany (right) has shown her sister how to roll over, sit up and even walk, Mrs Williams said. When Felicity (left) began to talk she would repeat words said by her sister . The twins have recently started classes together and 'love it', according to their father . The twins' parents, Gary, 28, and Hayley, 27, believe that it's thanks to the girls' special bond that Felicity has developed so well. Mrs Williams, from Walsall, in the West Midlands,s aid: 'We're so proud of our girls. 'Felicity has been able to watch her sister reach lots of milestones, and through copying has been able to reach them too. 'Tiffany has shown her sister how to roll over and sit up, and even walk. 'When Felicity began to speak, she was saying words that she'd heard her sister say. 'Even now, as the girls learn to read, Tiffany will help Felicity sound out words when she gets confused. 'We have always believed in Felicity and we know she'll do well, but Tiffany has made a huge difference to her. 'They certainly have that twin thing going on - they're soul mates.' The couple first noticed Tiffany's huge influence on her twin sister when the girls were learning to walk. Mrs Williams said: 'We were starting to worry as Felicity had got to 18 months old and she still wasn't walking - the cerebral palsy has really affected her right leg so it was a concern. Cerebral palsy is the general term for conditions that affect movement and co-ordination. It is estimated that 1 in 400 people in the UK is affected. It is caused by problems in the parts of the brain responsible for controlling muscles. The condition occurs if the brain is damaged before, during or shorly after birth, usually due to loss of oxygen. It can be caused by a difficult or premature birth, an infection caught by the mother during pregnancy, bleeding in the baby’s brain or mutations in genes that affect brain development. The symptoms of cerebral palsy normally become apparent during the first three years of a child's life. The main symptoms are: . · muscle stiffness or floppiness . · muscle weakness . · random and uncontrolled body movements . · balance and co-ordination problems . The symptoms can affect different areas of the body and will vary in severity from person to person. Some people will only have minor problems, whereas others will be severely disabled. Many people with cerebral palsy also have a number of associated problems, including repeated seizures or fits, drooling problems and difficulty swallowing. Some people with the condition may have communication and learning difficulties, although intelligence is often unaffected. 'A physiotherapist came to the house to try and teach her some exercises to help her walk, but she just wasn't getting it. 'But then all of a sudden Tiffany stood up next to Felicity and showed her what to do. 'Felicity copied her sister immediately, and before we knew it she had learnt to walk. 'It was amazing - even the therapists agree that watching and copying her sister has had a huge impact on her. 'We'd already started to wonder if Felicity was looking to Tiffany to teach her things, but this proved it for us.' Since then, Felicity has continued to copy her sister, and has continued to progress well. Mrs Williams said: 'Felicity is a little behind other children her age, but copying her sister has helped her develop. 'Felicity used to be nervous about walking on grass - as she was a little unstable already with her leg she didn't really like it, but Tiffany would hold her hand and show her what to do, and now she's fine with it. 'Felicity has learnt how to use felt tips and do jigsaws because Tiffany does them all the time, and will show her how they work. 'Even when they were learning to talk, Felicity would repeat her sister. 'Tiffany would ask us for a drink, and then before we knew it so would Felicity - it's really been incredible.' When Tiffany and Felicity were born two and a half months early in February 2010, medics raced to keep the tiny babies alive. After a tricky start to life, Tiffany was discharged after two months, but her twin sister faced a bigger struggle. Mr Williams said: 'When they were born neither of the girls could breathe on their own. 'It was a really scary time as we just expected to have two healthy babies - we were shell shocked. 'After initial breathing problem, Tiffany was doing really well, whilst Felicity developed a very serious bowel condition called neonatal necrotising enterocolitis - her bowel had started to die and was spreading to her other intestines. 'We didn't know if she was going to make it, but luckily they were able to operate and save her life. 'After the operation they gave Felicity a brain scan and they noticed she had dark spots on her white brain matter. 'We had no idea what this meant but the doctors explained she'd developed periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) - a form of brain damage that can lead to cerebral palsy. 'We think she may have developed it due to the stress and trauma of her birth and operations - but we'll never know 100 per cent. While Felicity is behind other children her age in terms of her development, she has made great progress thanks to her sister, her parents claim . Tiffany and Felicity were born two and a half months early in February 2010, and medics had to race to keep the tiny babies alive . 'It was horrible to learn that Felicity had this, but each day she slowly got better, and six months later she was finally discharged - it was a huge relief.' Finally at home together, Mr and Mrs Williams wondered whether their twins would ever bond after spending so much time apart. Mrs Williams said: 'I really worried that they wouldn't be close or they wouldn't get on, because they'd basically been separated from birth, but it was exactly the opposite. 'From day one Tiffany has been a source of help and encouragement to her sister - she's like a little mother hen.' Now, at age four, the girls are continuing to surprise their parents, and grow closer every day. Mrs Williams said: 'They've recently started dance classes together and they love it. 'Tiffany will always find things easier than her sister, but Felicity is coming on leaps and bounds and we couldn't be prouder. Mr Williams is now hoping to compete in the London Marathon next year in aid of Birmingham Children's hospital. He added: 'Felicity is doing better and better each day, and she's achieving so much. 'We think that Tiffany has grown into a very compassionate child - whenever a child in her class is upset she'll always be the one to help. 'We're incredibly proud of both of our girls.'

"Recovering: Rio Negro, the racehorse who was poisoned by crooks days before he was due to run - a crime blamed on illegal gambling syndicates . One of Venezuela's most-popular race horses is struggling to regain his strength after he was poisoned by an underground gambling ring. The attack on four-year-old stallion Rio Negro has shone a light on a criminal underworld where millions of dollars in bets are made under the table. The horse's dramatic plight has underscored the growing brazenness of the well-organised betting rings in Venezuela, who many say threaten to destroy the sport entirely. Rio Negro had been heavily favoured to win the Army Day derby until criminals injected him with a near-fatal overdose of cortisone sometime in June - police aren't exactly sure when. His trainers say he nearly collapsed and began urinating frequently during a training session four days before the June 22 race. He lost almost a fifth of his weight, his black-colored skin broke out in welts and he was diagnosed with temporary diabetes. 'It was painful to watch,' said vet Julio Lobo. Rio Negro is now kept in a dark, cold stable that looks more like a prison with iron bars and proliferation of security cameras to ward off intruders. Like many of its neighbours, Venezuela has long-suffered lawlessness and violence. But the country's situation has been badly exacerbated by civil divisions caused by the leftist policies of its longstanding socialist government. Since the death of hugely popular former president Hugo Chavez the country has been riven by unrest, with many middle class areas erupting into open revolt for a time earlier this year. Despite the country's massive oil wealth, after nearly 15 years of socialist policies the economy is in recession, there are shortages of basic goods, annual inflation is running above 60 per cent and crime rates are sky high. The approval ratings of Chavez's hand-picked successor, Nicolas Maduro, a former bus driver, have plummeted to just 35 per cent. But few in Venezuela are willing to return to the situation they faced before Chavez. Then it was one of the most unequal countries in the world, politically dominated by a mainly white ruling elite and with rates of poverty almost double current levels. And many Venezuelans are deeply sceptical of the opposition's democratic credentials after a failed 2002 coup against Chavez which was backed by the U.S. Nevertheless, the country is very sick. Authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the poisoning of Rio Negro, among them former police officers and a horse owner linked to betting rings. But it's unknown if the investigation, an outcry from top government officials and beefed-up security at La Rinconada track in Caracas can control the rings that some racing officials call 'mafias.' Gambling on horse races is legal in Venezuela, but the socialist government tightly controls betting at the country's four racetracks and 1,200 off-track bookies. Illegal gambling is driven by the government's limit of 1,000 bolivars on bets, which converts to about $10 (£6.20) at the black market rate. Vet Julio Lobo checks Rio Negro at a stable in La Rinconada racetrack in Caracas: The horse was a sensation of Venezuela's horse racing season until criminals injected him with a near-fatal overdose of cortisone . Last year, the industry in Venezuela handled about $120million in legal bets, according to the Paris-based International Federation of Horseracing Authorities. But Jaime Casas and others who follow the local horse racing industry say the real money is in illegal betting, especially now as Venezuelans try to boost the value of their bolivars in the face of 60 per cent inflation and a plunge in the currency's value on the black market. The illegal operations known as 'offices' can frequently be seen operating in plain view from inside the state-sanctioned gambling halls by so-called 'bankers' who receive bets in person and by phone. Venezuela's state-run National Institute of Hippodromes declined to comment on the illicit operations. Mr Casas, who runs the Hipicomputo 2000 website that tracks race results, estimated that illicit betting rings move between 50 and 60 times the legal market for gambling. The state-run horse racing agency says that on any given Sunday the government's take from wagers at La Rinconada can surpass $3million. Mr Casas said violence has also increasingly encroached on the sport through the kidnapping of and threats against jockeys. 'Illegal betting has existed in every part of the world for a long time,' he said. 'But here it was allowed to flourish with so much freedom and impunity.'","Stallion Rio Negro was injected with a near lethal dose of cortisone .

"The video of a NYPD officer appearing to racially profile two Muslim men because they are wearing traditional Islamic clothes has been exposed as a hoax. Shamelessly seeking to exploit recent tensions sparked in New York City by the choking death of Eric Garner in July, the video was created by two filmmakers hoping to create and profit from viral content on YouTube. Brooklyn residents Adam Saleh and Sheikh Akbar, who produce shareable content under the name 'TrueStoryASA' released the video entitled, 'Racial Profiling Experiment' over the weekend - duping many media outlets around the world. Scroll Down for Video . Fight: Adam Saleh and Sheikh Akbar begin brawling on the street while what appears to be an NYPD officer with his face blurred just watches . However, some were not quite so eager to throw yet more allegations of racism at New York's Finest and quickly realized that despite being viewed more than 140,000 times, the video was fake. TrueStoryASA boasts more than 60 million YouTube views and they count more than 661,000 subscribers on the video sharing site - raking in tens of thousands of dollars from advertizing revenue from commericials that play before their content. They generally post comedy videos and prank the public and in the 'Racial Profiling Experiment' the scene opens with Saleh and Akbar arguing loudly in the street. They are wearing jeans and T-shirts and push and shove each other and look like they are about to exchange punches. All the while, just visible in the frame is a what appears to be a NYPD officer, with his face blurred, standing, passively watching. Hoax: Adam Saleh and Sheikh Akbar appear to be immediately approached by the same officer 20 minutes later wearing Islamic clothes according to their debunked video . The argument was staged, the video gives the impression the police officer is real and was filmed by a friend in a parked car. The video then claims to jump forward 20 minutes and sees Saleh and Akbar wearing traditional Islamic garb. They describe these garments as their 'cultural clothes.' Quickly, they begin arguing again, but this time the cop, with his face still blurred approaches them immediately, asking, 'What’s all the arguing about? Why are you dressed like this?' The officer then rams Saleh against the wall and frisks him and demands, 'What is this? What’s in your pocket?' It is his phone, but the officer yells, 'Is this a gun? Is that a knife?' The officer does not seem to remove the item nor appear concerned that Akbar is standing near to him. Friends: The two are from Brooklyn and run their viral YouTube video content channel TrueStory ASA . Humor: They usually make comedic videos that pole fun at social issues - the purported NYPD hoax is a departure for them . The two then make their 'reveal' and tell the cop they were the same guys arguing 20 minutes before and that he has been caught out racially profiling them. The now chastened officer seems to want to leave the scene and then the video ends with a request for a thumbs up and to subsribe to their YouTube channel. The Smoking Gun showed the clip to a NYPD source who works at the 110th precinct nearby to the Queens neighborhood where the clip was filmed. He said that an officer would never be standing idly on a deserted street corner and said his uniform and utility belt were incorrect. He also questioned the officer's frisking. 'That’s not how they teach you in the academy,' he told The Smoking Gun and also poured scorn on the idea that an officer would ask a Muslim man why he was dressed in a certain way. A second source told The Smoking Gun that this was an 'obvious hoax' designed to 'smear the police'. Saleh and Akbar have been sent messages asking to respond, but have not yet done so.","Video released over weekend showing two Muslim men being racially profiled .

"Concerns: Esther Rantzen fears the allegations of . child abuse surrounding Jimmy Savile could destroy her 'life's work', . campaigning to protect children . Esther Rantzen fears the allegations of child abuse surrounding Jimmy Savile could destroy her 'life's work', campaigning to protect children it has emerged. The presenter was last week forced to deny rumours she is facing the sack as patron of a child abuse charity after claims she failed to act on allegations that Savile molested youngsters. Ms Rantzen, a patron of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC), had said earlier that some in broadcasting 'blocked their ears' to the claims against the Jill'll Fix It star 18 years ago. But in an interview with the Daily Express, Ms Rantzen said: 'Say what you like about me – just please don’t destroy my life’s work.' Ms Rantzen founded ChildLine, a . 24-hour confidential helpline that takes more than a million telephone . calls a year providing free counselling for children to discuss abuse . and neglect, in 1986. For more than 25 years she has campaigned to raise awareness of the bullying and sexual or psychological abuse of children. The 72-year-old, who is also a trustee of the NSPCC, said that she remembered finding Savile 'creepy' and 'very odd' and said that she had met him about six times at charity events. She . insisted she had only heard one rumour about Savile abusing young . children and that was when she was working at the BBC as a researcher . when she was 21. Ms Rantzen added that her main motivation was to continue campaigning for children and older people and bring them justice. She said: 'It . would be such a great shame if all that work was sabotaged by this. My . concern is for the children who are suffering and other survivors who . need support.' Esther Rantzen with Jimmy Savile, pictured in 1988. She has since said she found him 'creepy' and 'odd' She told MailOnline: 'I would be . very, very distressed if people lost confidence in me, particularly if . people working with children lose confidence in me, but I'm told that . everyone who works at whole-heatedly support me.' Ms Rantzen said there might be lessons that could be learned from the scandal. She said: 'A therapist said on Radio 4 . that Jimmy Savile groomed the whole nation and that is true. He . convinced us all that he was a tireless charity worker and a harmless, . eccentric entertainer. He wore a mask which disguised the fact that he . was predatory and dangerous. 'I think it's very important that we discover if there are lessons that can be learned. 'We need to set in place a . whistle-blowing process so that people can report abuse if things are . happening or if they witness things.' The interview with Ms Rantzen, who has been awarded an OBE and CBE, follows allegations by a sex abuse campaigner who said she confided in Ms Rantzen about Savile, but nobody acted on her concerns. A slew of alleged victims have come forward to claim that the popular presenter molested them . Shy Keenan, 49, who founded Phoenix . Survivors, a charity that supports child sex abuse victims and their . families, says she heard the rumours and believed she a had a 'duty' to . raise the alarm and so told Ms Rantzen after they were introduced . through a sex offender specialist. Ms Rantzen told the MailOnline last week how . she had 'absolutely no recollection' of meeting Ms Keenan, who claimed . she spoke up about the claims against the star 18 years ago. Ms Rantzen said: 'If it's true I'm afraid I have absolutely no recollection of the conversation with her (Ms Keenan). But she did concede that she had . 'literally had hundreds of conversations about child abuse but I'm sure I . do not remember meeting this woman'. She said: 'But I'm afraid that in my television life I did meet thousands of people.' 'It could have been after a . program... It said in The Sun that Ray Wyre [the pioneering probation . officer who worked with paedophiles] introduced us and I did know him . very well.' This week, Ms Rantzen said that what Savile did to children had produced 'national rage and fury'. She said it would be a 'tragedy' if the scandal damaged ChildLine's work. Founder: Ms Rantzen, who presented on television show That's Life, founded ChildLine in 1986 . Scotland Yard said the . investigation into Savile’s abuse of young girls has tripled in scale to . 340 separate lines of inquiry. There are now 60 potential victims . and 15 police forces investigating the paedophile BBC presenter’s six . decade reign of child abuse. David Cameron is facing Labour demands to set up an independent inquiry into the abuse scandal. Labour leader Ed Miliband insisted . that a broad inquiry into Savile’s activities at the BBC, Stoke . Mandeville hospital and Broadmoor was essential to 'do right by the . victims'. Culture Secretary Maria Miller has . dismissed calls for an independent inquiry, saying she was 'confident' BBC chiefs were taking the claims 'very seriously'.

Rosberg has now taken 10 pole positions to Hamilton’s seven, a remarkable record given that no previous team-mate has outperformed Hamilton, the acknowledged one-lap specialist, in qualifying over a season. ‘Perfect job if only it were tomorrow,’ said Rosberg. ‘I am in the best place but I have to make it count, which I didn’t do last time in Austin. I didn’t find my rhythm there but I am confident I can put that right.’ Yes, it is during races that Hamilton has proved the superior performer, having won 10 grands prix to Rosberg’s four. That gives the Briton a 24-point lead going into the penultimate round. Yet double scoring in Abu Dhabi in a fortnight leaves his title hopes vulnerable to a decisive mistake or a calamitous engine failure. Back to Saturday's showing in Brazil, Hamilton explained that he lost a bit of time at turns one and 10 on his final flying lap, but said: ‘It is a long race and there should be two or three stops. There are opportunities throughout, not just at the start. ‘The Brazil race means more to me than any other one. It is a race I nearly won in 2012 but I got taken out. I remember watching Ayrton (Senna) race on this track when I was younger, and that makes it special.’ A random factor in this capricious climate is the ever-present danger of rain, and that could yet play havoc with the otherwise unassailable Mercedes of Hamilton and Rosberg. Hamilton made two errors on his final run at turns one and 10 and finished three hundredths adrift of Rosberg . Hamilton is 24 points ahead of Rosberg with two races remaining, but has never tasted victory in Brazil . Someone who knows all about the local weather is Felipe Massa, who was supported warmly en route to an impressive third fastest for Williams. Every time he tore along the pit straight, his countrymen got to their feet, waved their hands in the air and let out a cheer that carried across the track to the media centre over the garages. Jenson Button, who is due to leave McLaren at the end of the season to make way for Fernando Alonso, beat his team-mate Kevin Magnussen and will start fifth, two places ahead of the Dane. Away from Sao Paulo, Caterham are trying to raise enough money to compete in Abu Dhabi. They have launched a ‘crowdfunding’ scheme by which supporters are urged to contribute a minimum of £10 in exchange for bits of old car. Bernie Ecclestone is unimpressed that Caterham are trying to raise money to compete in Abu Dhabi . Rosberg has now taken 10 pole positions to Mercedes team-mate Hamilton’s seven this season . So far the team, who are administration with debts of £16million, have raised £500,000 towards a target of £2.35million. Their deadline is next Friday and the clock is ticking loudly. But F1’s puppeteer Bernie Ecclestone is unimpressed by the project. ‘I think it’s a disaster,’ he said. ‘We don’t want begging bowls. If people can’t afford to be in Formula One, they have to find something else to do. ‘If I sit in a poker game and I can’t afford to be there with the other people, I get killed and have to leave. ‘We give the teams nearly $900million (£561m) a year. We don’t spend it. ‘When I had a race team a few years ago, in fact a few hundred years ago, I used to run it according to how much money we could spend and we won the world championship. ‘That’s what they don’t do. They don’t seem to understand that somebody is going to be last.’ That someone in qualifying was Pastor Maldonado of Lotus. There were no surprises in the eight who fell out of the reckoning with him, leaving the 10 leading lights in the shootout for pole. And, as is his consistent habit, Rosberg shone brightest at the sharp end of Saturday afternoon, at a record average speed of 138.45mph.

"Indiana sophomore Devin Davis is improving after being struck by a teammate's car and suffering a head injury, the school said Sunday. The university issued a news release quoting team physician Dr. Larry Rink as saying Davis was 'doing better' Sunday morning and had benefited from uninterrupted rest. 'His speech is normal and he has the use of all extremities,' Rink said. Accident: Indiana University basketball player Devin Davis (left) was hospitalized this weekend after accidentally being struck by teammate Emmitt Holt's (right) SUV outside Memorial Stadium. Sophomore Davis pictured above in the November 4, 2013 NCAA college exhibition game against Hillsdale . The news release did not indicate the 19-year-old's medical condition. He had been listed in serious condition Saturday at IU Health Bloomington Hospital. Bloomington police say they found Davis unconscious early Saturday after he was struck by an SUV driven by teammate Emmitt Holt outside of Memorial Stadium. They say Holt had dropped off Davis and was driving away when Davis re-entered the roadway about 12:45 a.m. and collided with the front passenger side of the SUV. Coach Tom Crean issued a statement Sunday, saying the team was looking forward to Davis's continued recovery. 'Too often in life, we all take for granted the simple tasks of opening our eyes, processing thoughts and putting a simple sentence together,' Crean said. 'In our program, we routinely emphasize to our players that everything matters and watching Devin improve just over the last 36 hours has furthered our belief in that approach.' Crean said the Davis family and the team appreciated 'the concern, calls, texts, and thoughts and prayers we have received.' Davis' family also issued a statement Sunday night. 'As all parents can understand, the last 40+ hours have been difficult for us and for all of those who care about our son. Devin's condition is improving and we know that there is a road to recovery ahead,' the family said. Scene: Holt was dropping Davis outside of Memorial Stadium (pictured)early Saturday morning when the incident happened. Holt was cited for underage drinking and for being a minor, operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol content over 0.02. The school says he had a BAC of 0.025, which would not be considered impaired if he were over the legal age limit . 'We want to thank the incredible team at IU Health Bloomington Hospital for taking such great care of Devin. We also want to express our gratitude to coach Crean, who has been by Devin's bedside for most of the past two days and to all of his coaches, teammates and the extended Hoosier family who have kept him in their prayers.' Davis played a minor role for the Hoosiers last season, averaging 2.4 points and 2.6 rebounds in 8.8 minutes per game. This year, the 6-foot-7, 230-pound forward from Indianapolis was expected to be a key player in the middle this season. The Hoosiers have only four players who are listed taller than Davis, and three are freshmen. Holt, a 6-foot-7 forward from Webster, New York, was cited for misdemeanor illegal consumption of alcohol and for being a minor operating a vehicle with a blood-alcohol content above 0.02, Bloomington Police Sgt. Jeffery Canada said. The school said Saturday that Holt's BAC was 0.025. In September, junior guard Yogi Ferrell and sophomore guard Stanford Robinson entered pretrial diversion programs after being charged in April with consumption of an alcoholic beverage by a minor and possession of false identification. Junior forward Hanner Mosquera-Perea was arrested in Bloomington in February on preliminary drunk driving charges. Indiana opens the season Nov. 14 against Mississippi Valley State.","Sophomore Devin Davis was hit by teammate Emmitt Holt's SUV after being dropped outside Memorial Stadium at 12:45am Saturday morning .

"Sotheby's is being sued over claims a painting it sold for £42,000 was actually a £10million Caravaggio. The bitter legal battle was sparked by Lancelot Thwaytes, whose family bought the work for a reputed £140 in 1962 and kept it for almost half a century until its sale in 2006. Renowned collector Sir Denis Mahon bought it at auction, where it was advertised as an imitator's version of Caravaggio's masterpiece The Cardsharps. Scroll down for video . Legal battle: This 'copy' is at the centre of a costly High Court fight involving some of the world's leading Caravaggio experts after it sold for just £42,000 - before its buyer declared it was a £10million original . The real thing: The main version of Caravaggio's The Cardsharps, which hangs in the Kimbell Museum in Texas . After his purchase, Sir Denis declared it an early version by the artist himself - worth more than 200 times what he paid, according to papers filed at the High Court. Since the claim by Sir Denis, who died aged 100 three years ago, Mr Thwaytes has been building a hugely expensive legal case against the auction giant - which is resolutely standing by its experts. Some of the world's most eminent Caravaggio scholars will give evidence at a High Court trial which started this morning. As the trial opened, judge Mrs Justice Rose was taken through a 'spot the difference' exercise between the two pieces. Henry Legge QC, representing Mr Thwaytes, said: 'It is easy when one is looking at these paintings to regard issues of attribution as a painting competition and we assume, naturally, that he was very good at painting. 'It is not merely a question of which painting is better, but distinguishing which painting shares characteristics of Caravaggio. Anger: Lancelot Thwaytes, who sold the work for just £42,000, arrives at the High Court for the hearing . 'It is easy to fall into the fallacy of thinking ""it's a famous painter - it's painted well."" That's not how attribution works.' Mr Thwaytes' claim said the painting was an early version by Caravaggio of his work The Cardsharps - one of his masterpieces. The original hangs in the Kimbell Museum in Texas and shows a young man falling victim to a pair of cheats at a card game. It is one of only 50 or so works by Caravaggio, one of the masters of his age, which survive to this day. Mr Thwaytes claimed experts for Sotheby's did not consult widely enough before the sale of the painting - which is now hanging in the Museum of the Order of St John in London - in December 2006. He said that he only decided to sell the painting when he was told it was a 17th century copy. In documents submitted to the High Court, Mr Thwaytes's lawyers criticised the auction house for negligence claiming they failed to carry out proper tests and consult experts. In a skeleton argument they said: 'Sotheby's is responsible for all the foreseeable loss which is a consequence of Mr Thwaytes having acted on that advice. '[The] evidence is that had the painting been sold at auction in 2006... it would have achieved £11m. 'However, a later sale by private treaty might have achieved a higher price than £11m.' Mr Legge told the court: 'This case at its core is a very simple story. 'Mr Thwaytes had a picture which he thought might be by Caravaggio [so] he sent it to Sotheby's for research. 'Sotheby's looked at it and they told him that the painting wasn't by Caravaggio, but they hadn't done the tests that he had asked them to do. 'They came back to him and said they had done the X-rays on the painting and said it wasn't Caravaggio, but they didn't do infra-red imaging. 'When it was sold the new owner had it cleaned and submitted it to the tests, including infra-red and it was subsequently attributed to Caravaggio. Italian master: Only 50 or so works survive by Caravaggio (left), one of the masters of his age. Right: The original listing in the auction house catalogue by Sotheby's when the painting was sold in December 2006 . 'At the core this is a negligence case, it is about Sotheby's actions and not attribution.' When the Museum of the Order of St John acquired the work on loan earlier this year, it told journalists: 'In 2006, Sir Denis discovered another version of The Cardsharps, virtually identical to the Kimbell picture. 'After exhaustive study and scientific analysis, Sir Denis concluded that this was an earlier version, also painted for Cardinal del Monte. 'The attribution was also supported by other leading Caravaggio scholars, such as Mina Gregori, Maurizio Marini, Antonio Paolucci, Daniele Benati Thomas Schneider, and others.' But Sotheby's is fiercely contesting the claim - and calling renowned experts to give evidence on their behalf. They will include Caravaggio scholar Sir Richard Spear, who supports the auction house's stance. The auction house said in its High Court statement, seen by MailOnline: 'The painting is not by Caravaggio and is clearly inferior in quality to the universally acknowledged original in the Kimbell Museum. Respected: The work was bought and declared a real Caravaggio by collector Sir Denis Mahon (pictured) 'There is a vast difference in quality between the Kimbell Cardsharps and the Painting at issue. 'The Kimbell Cardsharps was painted by Caravaggio with the striking virtuosity and realism for which his early works are famous. The quality of execution on display in the Painting falls far short of the Kimbell original. 'Our experts were entirely competent to make this assessment and even if they had carried out further investigation, this would just have confirmed their view that the painting is an anonymous copy. 'None of the leading scholars who have opined on the painting since Denis Mahon acquired it think that it is by Caravaggio.' The auction house claimed one of Mr Thwayte's experts is an 'administrator' who specialises in the Renaissance and not the Baroque period, while another two are 'restorers without qualifications in art history'. 'None of these individuals are ""leading Caravaggio scholars''', the auction house said. The statement added Mr Thwaytes could have sought his own experts at the time of the sale. Sotheby's claim that despite the painting now being regarded by some as a genuine Caravaggio, no leading expert has confirmed it as the master's work. Mr Thwaytes could not be reached for comment. The hearing, which is expected to last three weeks, continues.","Painting sold in 2006 was attributed to a follower of the Italian master .

"Bad drivers and illegal parkers – consider yourselves warned. The online community is taking a stand against dangerous and stupid motorists, using Facebook to name and shame the culprits. It’s hoped that by identifying those responsible of reckless driving, the public humiliation will stop them from re-offending, or persuade them to be more considerate. A Christchurch Facebook page is the latest to join the campaign, showcasing some of the worst human hazards on New Zealand roads. This is a park, right? A driver is incapable of distinguishing the difference between the road (good for parking) and the curb (bad for parking) Good luck everybody else! A car blatantly parks another car in, with its tail end in the middle of the road . If parking in a disabled parking space without a permit wasn't bad enough, this car chose to park in the lane horizontally. As you do. It's unknown who was in the wrong in this sticky situation, but it's clear that it all ended wrong, with the sedan sandwiched between the curb and a truck . In August, Daily Mail reported about the Australian 'Wall of Shame' Facebook page, posting photos of hundreds of fully-capable motorists parking in disabled parking spaces. The phenomenon has continued, with the Shocking Christchurch Drivers Facebook page gaining more than 8000 likes in just five days, with Facebook users uploading shocking photographs of stupid motorist behaviour. The number plate and any identifying features are always published to ensure maximum embarrassment. The Facebook page makes it clear that driving a flash car, doesn't mean the person can drive at all . It appears this car space wasn't spacious enough for 'Mitch', with the tail end of the car taking up half of the space behind. Although Mitch didn't have time to correct his park, he could put up his foil car sunshade . This fancy pants corvette doesn't follow the rules! This park speaks for itself - irritating and obnoxious . Commenters thrill in guffawing at the outrageous photographs and videos – which include a driver taking up four parking spots, drivers parked diagonally across disabled parking space and even a motorist on the wrong side of the road. But some examples of terrible driving aren’t just inconvenient or ridiculous – some submissions to the website show shocking moments that put the lives of the driver and all other motorists in mortal danger. Helmet camera footage from a motorbike rider shows a car driving onto the wrong side of the road to try and overtake another car, when a car turns the corner, narrowly avoiding a head on collision. This driver 'kind of' parked in a disabled parking space. But he also 'kind of' parked on the pavement, so maybe that's okay . Somehow, four car spaces seems a little... The car owner will have plenty of new enemies by the time they return to their car . Not only is this a terrible park, this Facebook user indicates that there were nine WORSE parks before it . Hopefully the driver on the right wasn't hoping to go anywhere in a hurry, with the driver of the car on the left somehow thinking this was an acceptable park . Another video from a dashboard camera shows a truck changing lanes, seemingly oblivious to a vehicle in its path, forcing the car to hastily veer off the road. The site’s administrator, Steve (surname withheld) says he has been blown away by the number of outrageous incidents that have been published on the Facebook page and hopes the Facebook page can change people’s behaviour on the roads. 'Race 1' is parked in the middle of the footpath, with absolutely no consideration to pedestrians . Note to self: remember the handbrake! The plumber driving this van was not having a good morning . The mind boggles: let's just assume this driver had had enough of driving for one day when they left their car in this ridiculous position . ‘As both a cyclist and motorist, I am concerned to see how many people take chances on the road, (such as) cyclists being knocked off by cars (and) crazy driving in rush hour traffic to gain a couple of spaces in front,’ Steve told stuff.co.nz . ‘If putting this online will help slow some people down, or stop them running a red light, or make them more aware of others - then it's job done really.’ A Christchurch police spokeswoman said police could investigate serious roading incidents on social media, but typically needed to receive a complaint and evidence from someone, according to stuff.co.nz. Not one but two disabled parking spots: the epitomy of at least if this driver was going to be a bad driver, they decided to be VERY good at that . Innovative parking: this car decides to create its own car space in close proximity to the shops. Wonderful!","A new Facebook page in Christchurch names and shames terrible drivers .
In five days the group has more than 8000 likes and has been inundated with photos and videos of shocking drivers .

"A mother-of-one left brain damaged and needing 24-hour care has won a six-figure payout after doctors failed to spot the signs of a life-threatening infection. Clare Day, 29, was taken to hospital in December 2009 after suffering a tight and uncomfortable chest, but was sent home despite an x-ray showing a shadow on her lungs. In the following months, she began to experience known symptoms of meningitis including headaches, vomiting, dramatic weight loss and fainting. Clare Day, 29, was left brain damaged and needing 24-hour care after doctors repeatedly told her the signs of deadly meningitis infection were 'nothing to worry about'. Her family now care for her six-year-old son . Officials at Bristol Royal Infirmary (pictured) where Ms Day was taken have apologised to her family, and said it is 'regrettable that high standards of patient care were not met in this case' Ms Day, of Horfield, Bristol, was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary on several occasions over five months, but was told her symptoms were ""nothing to worry about"", her lawyers claim. Finally, an ambulance took Ms Day to hospital where she underwent a scan. This revealed she had tuberculous meningitis, a rare condition where tuberculosis bacteria invade the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. She required immediate brain surgery to remove fluid from her brain, but was left brain damaged. She now has problems with memory and processing information, so needs 24-hour care and help in caring for her six-year-old son. Yesterday, lawyers acting on behalf of Ms Day's family secured a six-figure payout at the High Court from University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, although the exact sum has not been revealed. The hospital trust has apologised to the family and said it is 'regrettable that high standards of care were not met in this case'. Ms Day's mother, Elaine Nikolovski, who helps to care for her daughter and grandson, said: 'Clare's life was changed forever after the meningitis and it is so frustrating that with different care things may have been different. 'We are relieved that today marks the end of the legal proceedings and that the settlement has now been approved so that we can access the vital support to help assist with her future medical and care costs, and ensure she has the best possible quality of life. Ms Day's family won a six figure payout from the hospital trust, which they say will go towards future medical costs . 'I hope that lessons have been learnt by the trust to ensure other families are not put through what we have and that staff are adequately trained to spot the symptoms of meningitis.' Ms Day underwent an operation to fit a shunt – a medical device to drain fluid from her brain - on April 11, 2010. Lawyers argued the delay in diagnosis meant her body quickly started to shut down, with her oxygen levels falling dangerously low as doctors worked to save her life. Julie Lewis, a partner at Irwin Mitchell law firm, who represented the family, said: 'Clare's life has been left devastated by the meningitis. 'Our expert medical evidence suggested that if the correct diagnosis and care had been administered when she first showed symptoms, her life is likely to have been very different. 'The settlement approved by the High Court today will ensure Clare has access to vital medical care that she will need for the rest of her life. 'This will give her family the peace of mind that any ongoing treatment will now be taken care of. 'Patient safety has to be the number one priority for everyone in the NHS and lessons must be learnt by this trust, and others across the country, to ensure the same mistakes do not happen again.' Deborah Lee, deputy chief executive at University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, apologised to Ms Day and her family. 'On behalf of the trust, I am deeply sorry for the delay in Ms Day's diagnosis,' she said. 'The trust has high standards for patient care and it is very regrettable that these standards were not achieved in Ms Day's case. 'We have committed to ensure any learning from this incident is acted upon. I would like to reiterate our sincere apology and wish Ms Day and her family the best for the future.' Tuberculous meningitis (TB meningitis) is the most severe form of tuberculosis. It occurs when tuberculosis bacteria invade the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The infection usually begins elsewhere in the body, usually in the lungs, and then travels through the bloodstream to the meninges where small abscesses (called microtubercles) are formed. When these abscesses burst, TB meningitis is the result. TB meningitis normally begins with vague, non-specific symptoms of aches and pains, low-grade fever, generally feeling unwell, tired, irritable, not being able to sleep or eat properly, and a gradually worsening headache. This lasts for two to eight weeks. In the elderly, symptoms are even more subtle, often just drowsiness and feeling unwell. It is not until weeks later that more obvious symptoms like vomiting, severe headache, dislike of lights, neck stiffness and seizures occur. Without medical treatment, the disease will progress causing confusion, obvious signs of nerve damage and eventually resulting in coma. Although 70 – 85 per cent of those affected will survive, up to one quarter of those may have long-term afer-effects.

"A heart-rending letter a soldier wrote to his sweetheart in the event of his death revealing how nerves had stopped him proposing marriage has been uncovered after 98 years. Captain Harry Cromie wrote the dreaded 'if you're reading this...' note to Vera Vereker on the eve of going into battle at the Somme in the First World War in October 1916. He was killed in action  and fours days later 18-year-old Vera received his last, devastating letter in the post. In the poignant note, Capt Cromie, who was 20 when he died, told Vera he hadn't been able to pluck up the courage to ask her to marry him the last time they saw one another. Heartbreaking: Captain Harry Cromie wrote the letter no one should ever receive to Vera Vereker on the eve of going into battle at the Somme in the First World War in October 1916. He did not live to see her again . Despite going on to find love with another man and marry and have children, Vera kept the two page letter for the rest of her life, along with a locket containing photos of her and Harry . It reads: 'By this you will know that I have been killed. 'I meant to ask you to be engaged to me but when I was on leave I was too frightened to say anything - I loved you very, very much and would have done anything for you.' Harry signed off: 'Ever your own loving boy.' Despite going on to find love with another man and marry and have children, Vera kept the two page letter for the rest of her life, along with a locket containing photos of her and Harry. She gave her granddaughter Kate Vereka-Durston the locket on her deathbed in 1988. Her other granddaughter, Mary Kendall, discovered the letter in a case of her grandmother's belongings. But it has only been since the creation of online genealogy websites that Mrs Kendall, 70, has been able to find out more information about Capt Cromie and his romance with her grandmother. The touching account was revealed for the first time on BBC1's Antiques Roadshow after Mrs Kendall, from Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, took the items to one of the programme's events. She said: 'I had a suitcase of old memorabilia of my grandmothers' after she died and this letter was with all these other mundane things. Capt Cromie was born in October 1896 and was the younger son of Joan and Captain Charles Cromie, who was the British vice-consul to Morocco . 'I just read it once and thought about how sad it was and then put it to one side and forgot about it. 'Years later I started doing some family research and remembered the letter and tried to find out who 'Harry' in the letter was.' Mrs Kendall dug out an old photo album that belonged to her grandmother and found black and white snaps of a 'Harry' visiting her parents' house in Nettlestone on the Isle of Wight in the summer of 1916. Along with the photo in the locket, she was able to compare them with a photograph from Capt Harry Cromie's military records. Mrs Kendall said: 'It appears that his mother and my grandmother's parents were good friends. Harry was in the Hampshire Regiment which was based on the Isle of Wight before the Somme so he must have spent time with her on leave. 'It is clear from the letter and the locket that they were very much in love. 'The letter stabs you in the heart and makes you think of what might have been. If he had survived the war I wouldn't be here now.' Capt Cromie was born in October 1896 and was the younger son of Joan and Captain Charles Cromie, who was the British vice-consul to Morocco. The family lived in Ringwood, Hampshire, and Capt Cromie was a schoolteacher before he joined the Hampshire Regiment in February 1915. In June 1915, his elder brother, Lieutenant Maurice Cromie of the Hampshire Regiment, was killed at Gallipoli. Capt Cromie's battalion was sent to the Somme in October 1916 and on the 23rd the men attacked the German lines at Lesboeufs, coming under heavy machine gun and rifle fire. He was killed and, just like his older brother, his body was never recovered. Their names were added the the war memorials at Theipval and Helles respectively. Vera's mother died in 1915 and her father passed away the following year. Mrs Kendall said: 'One can only imagine what she must have gone through at that time.' Vera married RAF officer Albert Durston in 1918 and they had three children. She divorced and remarried Royal Naval commander Geoffrey Dalley in 1948. At the time of her death aged 91 in 1988 she was lived in Motcombe, Dorset. In the poignant note, Capt Cromie, who was 20 when he died, told Vera he hadn't been able to pluck up the courage to ask her to marry him the last time they saw one another .","Captain Harry Cromie wrote final note to Vera Vereker on eve of  the Somme .

"Ebola-stricken nurse Nina Pham's condition was downgraded to fair on Friday, according to doctors at the National Institutes of Health. The 26-year-old nurse, who contracted Ebola while caring for Thomas Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, was previously described as being in a good condition on Thursday. According to the American Hospital Association's scale used to describe a patient's health, a 'fair condition' is listed as worse than a 'good condition'. Scroll down for videos . Nurse Nina Pham pictured shortly before she was discharged from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas to receive further treatment at the National Institutes of Health hospital in Bethesda, Maryland . Dr Anthony Fauci (pictured front) and colleagues at the National Institute said at a press conference on Friday that nurse Nina Pham was receiving 'optimum care' and called her a 'trooper' Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a briefing outside the Maryland hospital on Friday that Miss Pham was in a 'fair, stable condition and resting comfortably'. He did not describe further details of her condition due to patient confidentiality but said she still had Ebola symptoms. Dr Fauci denied that Miss Pham was deteriorating adding that she is sitting up, talking with staff and eating. Miss Pham, 26, broke down in tears on Thursday night when saying goodbye to her doctors in Dallas . Dr Fauci added that the nurse is getting 'optimum, intensive care' but said she is extremely fatigued because Ebola 'knocks you out'. The doctor described the nurse as 'a trooper' adding that she was being cared for round-the-clock by a specialized team of doctors and nurses. The nurse, who got a dose of antibody-rich serum from Dr Kent Brantly who survived Ebola, could get other experimental treatments, NBC reported. Miss Pham's mother and sister were in the area while she undergoes treatment in a specialized quarantine unit at NIH. The 26-year-old nurse contracted Ebola after volunteering to care for 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan. Mr Duncan, 42, passed away on October 8 from the deadly disease. On Thursday, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital released a video showing the bittersweet moment Ebola-patient Nina Pham said goodbye to her doctor before leaving Dallas for further treatment in Maryland. In the video released at Ms Pham's request, her treating physician in Dallas gets emotional as he sees her off on her trip to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda. Goodbyes: The video was recorded just before Miss Pham left the Dallas hospital on Thursday. She was the first there to contract Ebola after treating U.S. 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan . Another health care worker in the room is seen handing Ms Pham a tissue to wipe away her tears . 'Thanks for getting well. Thanks for being part of the volunteer team to take care of our first patient,' Dr Weinstein is heard saying, as he focuses the camera on Miss Pham, reclining in her hospital bed. Amber Vinson, 29, was the second nurse diagnosed with Ebola after caring for Thomas Duncan . 'It means a lot. This has been a huge effort by all of you,' he added, before tearing up. Ms Pham then smiled and told her doctor not to cry. 'We're really proud of you,' Dr Weinstein said. Miss Pham then started crying herself, and another physician, standing by in full hazmat suit, handed her a tissue to wipe away her tears. The camera didn't linger on Miss Pham long enough to see where she disposed of the wet tissue after drying her eyes. 'I love you guys,' she said. 'We love you, Nina,' Dr Weinstein responded, at the end of the video. The 26-year-old was discharged from the Dallas hospital on Thursday evening to fanfare as her coworkers gathered outside the building to see her off, holding up signs reading 'Get well' and 'You're a rock star'. She landed in Bethesda, Maryland around 10.40pm (ET) and was admitted to NIH hospital shortly before midnight. On Thursday, Miss Pham asked Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to release a statement on her behalf thanking her family, friends and co-workers for the outpouring of support. ‘I feel very blessed, and have gained strength from their support. I appreciate everything that my coworkers [sic] have done to care for me at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas,’ the nurse stated. ‘I’m doing really well thanks to this team, which is the best in the world. I believe in my talented coworkers. I am #presbyproud!’ Ms Pham was discharged from Texas Health on Thursday and into the care of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Maryland . The press release from the beleaguered hospital also included a statement from Dr Gary Weinstein, chief of pulmonology and critical care medicine, who described the decision to transfer Miss Pham to Maryland as a difficult one. ‘We’re so glad she has improved so much in such a short amount of time,’ he said. ‘Our prayers are with her, and she’ll be in wonderful hands at NIH.’ Hospital spokesperson Candace White added that it is in the best interest of everyone involved to 'give the hospital an opportunity to prepare for whatever comes next'. Meanwhile, the City of Dallas released new photos of Miss Pham's beloved Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Bentley, looking cheerful during quarantine at the Dallas Animal Services and Adoption Center. The dog is  being cared for by professionals in protective Hazmat suits. City spokeswoman Sana Syed tweeted that Bentley was doing well considering the sudden separation from his owner. ‘Bentley is settling in, getting used to new routines. The cutie played w/ new toy and snuggled w/ vet,’ she wrote on Thursday. On Wednesday, Presbyterian Hospital was treating two Ebola patients - Miss Pham and nurse Amber Vinson, both employees of the hospital who contracted Ebola from Mr Duncan. Late on Wednesday night, Miss Vinson, 29, was flown out of Dallas to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, to be cared for in a specialized unit. Bethesda bound: Ms Pham boarded her private flight to Maryland on Thursday evening, and is seen in yellow being lead out of the ambulance by workers in similar protective clothing . On her way: Ms Pham's coworkers at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital lined up outside the hospital Thursday evening as she left in an ambulance to board a chartered flight to Maryland .

On Wednesday, Presbyterian Hospital was treating two Ebola patients - Ms Pham and nurse Amber Vinson, both employees of the hospital who contracted the disease while treating 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan. By tonight, the hospital will have zero Ebola patients in its care after federal officials ordered both of them moved to specialized facilities. Miss Vinson was flown out of Dallas to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta Wednesday night. There are four hospitals with infectious disease isolation wards in the United States. Three of the centers are currently treating patients . Ebola patient Nina Pham's dog Bentley in quarantine in this photo released Thursday by City of Dallas. The sick nurse's beloved Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is being cared for by professionals wearing protective hazmat suits . Nurses have come forward to allege that training and procedures at the hospital were not adequate to protect them. Medical records released by Mr Dunca's family revealed that during his first two days in the hospital, nurses did not wear protective hazmat gear when treating him. Nurses also complained that their necks and wrists were exposed in the suits that they were given, that some supervisors said face masks weren't necessary and that Duncan was not isolated for hours before he was admitted to the hospital. All these claims follow the shocking news weeks ago that Duncan was sent home on September 26 with a prescription for antibiotics when he first showed up at the hospital - despite telling nurses he had traveled from West Africa. There are currently four Americans being treated for Ebola in the United States. NBC News freelancer Ashoka Mukpo is being treated at University of Nebraska Medical Center in Lincoln. Miss Vinson is at Emory University Hospital, along with an American World Health Organization doctor, who has not been identified, who contracted the disease while working in Sierre Leone. The only U.S. hospital with an infectious disease isolation unit that has thus far not treated an Ebola patient is St Patrick Hospital in Missoula, Montana. There are four special infectious disease hospitals in the US - one in Maryland, one in Atlanta, one in Nebraska and one in Montana .","According to the American Hospital Association's scale used to describe a patient's health, a 'fair condition' is listed as worse than a 'good condition'

"With less than a month left until key state and federal elections, high-profile Democrats, including Vice President Joe Biden, First Lady Michelle Obama and Bill and Hillary Clinton, are busying themselves campaigning for Democratic candidates, appearing alongside them at rallies and get-out-the-vote events. Noticeably missing out front and center at similar events is another recognizable Democrat: President Barack Obama. While the president has headlined a flurry of fundraisers for the Democratic Party's official campaign arms and at least one political action committee, individual candidates are keeping him at arm's length. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, left, takes a selfie with former President Bill Clinton during a rally today at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway, Arkansas. Clinton is headlining a series of rallies around the state this week to support Arkansas Democrats . Clinton was the belle of the ball today in Arkansas, as he arrived back in home state to campaign for Democratic candidates . Obama, whose approval rating has been upside down for months, has not appeared at public events with current or aspiring federal lawmakers and statewide executives, and that's just the way they like it. 'I don’t need him campaigning for me — I need him to change some of his policies,' endangered Democratic Sen. Mark Begich when asked earlier this year if he'd welcome the president's presence on the campaign trail. Kentucky's Democratic nominee to the Senate, Alison Lundergan Grimes, even released an ad explaining to voters that she is not Obama and disagrees with him on several issues important to her state. Instead, Grimes has turned to former president Bill Clinton to help sell her candidacy to Kentucky voters. Calling herself a 'Clinton Democrat,' Grimes has held two events featuring the retired politician. Last week he cut an ad for her - the first one he's done for the upcoming election. Hillary Clinton will also travel to Kentucky this month to campaign for Grimes, according to Politico, but it's not clear when or where they'll join forces. Grimes is challenging Senate Minority Leader and longtime Kentucky politician Mitch McConnell for his Senate seat. The Clintons are friends of her father, Jerry. The MinnPost reports that Bill Clinton also has plans to attend a rally in the North Star State this Friday for Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton and Sen. Al Franken. This afternoon he returned to his home state of Arkansas to campaign for Sen. Tom Pryor. Bill also stepped in as the headliner of a fundraiser for Maryland Lt. Governor Anthony Brown last week when Hillary cancelled after their only daughter Chelsea gave birth to her first child and made a surprise appearance at a Sept. 15 fundraiser for Georgia Sen. candidate Michelle Nunn. Hillary Clinton dines with Florida gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist during a trip to the Sunshine State on Friday. Crist, who once ran the state as a Republican, is seeking election to his old job as a Democrat. Clinton threw her support behind his candidacy at a closed-door fundraiser during her trip . Both Clintons traveled to Iowa last month to campaign for Iowa Congressman Bruce Braley, who is running for the state's open Senate seat, and other Democrats while appearing at retiring Sen. Tom Harkin's annual steak fry. After taking a few days of downtime to spend with her new grandchild, Hillary will be back on the road again this month, according to CNN, stumping again for Braley, as well as candidates in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia and Colorado. 'Secretary Clinton is the right person at the right time for Democrats who are focused on turning out the vote and persuading undecided voters, particularly women, in the remaining days of the election,' Guy Cecil, director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told CNN. Clinton's not just campaigning to help Democrats retain control of the Senate. On Thursday, she'll make a stop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to campaign for that state's Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Tom Wolf, who is challenging sitting Republican Gov. Tom Corbett. She'll campaign for both New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Gov. Maggie Hassan when she travels there on Nov. 2, a Democratic source told CNN. Even first lady Michelle Obama, who notoriously dislikes campaigning, is lending her credibility to Democratic candidates. Most recently she threw herself into the gubernatorial race in her home state of Illinois. Gov. Pat Quinn released an ad this morning featuring the first lady, and tomorrow she'll appear at a grassroots event with him in Chicago. She'll also make a stop in Wisconsin on Tuesday to headline a rally for Mary Burke, who hopes to defeat Republican Gov. Scott Walker in November. The first lady has already done one event for Burke, a voter mobilization rally, on Sept. 29. This will be her second trip to the consequential state in just over a week. On Friday she made trips to Massachusetts and Maine to stump for the state's respective Democratic gubernatorial candidates, Martha Coakley and Congressman Mike Michaud. First Lady Michelle Obama and Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley acknowledge the cheers of supporters at the conclusion of a campaign event on Friday in Boston. Michelle Obama's presence has been in high demand this election cycle. Her husband, not so much . Vice President Joe Biden has also been summoned onto the campaign trail and will head to California tonight to attend an event for congressional candidate Amanda Renteria and Secretary of State candidate Alex Padilla, according to the White House. Wednesday he'll campaign with Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, and Thursday he'll stump for Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell. Meanwhile, President Obama will travel to New York, Connecticut and California for Democratic National Committee and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraisers. He'll attend a private fundraiser at actress Gweneth Paltrow's home on Thursday in Los Angeles and an intimate event with high-dollar donors at the home of restaurateur Michael Chow and his wife Eva in San Francisco on Friday, according to the Hollywood Reporter. the candidate who is up for reelection this fall and was willing to be seen with Obama earlier this summer, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, appears to have accidentally run into president. Obama dropped into a bar that Hickenlooper used to own after meeting with supporters nearby during a July visit to Colorado, and the governor just happened to be hanging out there. Upon bumping into each other at the bar, the Democratic politicians grabbed a beer together and faced off in two rounds of pool, at Hickenlooper's invitation. The Colorado governor did not attend any official events with Obama during the trip, citing scheduling conflicts, however, and the state's Democratic senator, Mark Udall, who is also up for reelection, cancelled an appearance with Obama   on the day of, opting to stay in Washington, D.C., instead. Obama had to go stag to the money-raising event that Udall was a host of and partly benefited his reelection campaign.","While the president has headlined a flurry of fundraisers for the Democratic Party, individual candidates are keeping him at arm's length .

"A £13,000 coffee maker, a £10,400 pinball machine and a £6,500 set of stones from Papua New Guinea are just three of the high-value items Christie's is putting up for sale in time for Christmas. But this year the London auction house will break with tradition and sell the 42 lots at a fixed price - offering shoppers the chance to bypass bidding and walk away with their big-ticket gifts immediately. The new approach to buying, called 'Buy or Bid', is a first in Christie's 250-year history and will offer customers a service similar to the 'Buy It Now' option offered by online auction giant eBay. Pricey playtime: This vintage 1962 pinball machine can be bought outright for £10,400 at Christie's, London . Most expensive: This coffee maker, left, will cost £13,000 and this large Moroccan Ammonite from the cretaceous period (right) is available to buy at Christie's for £2,080 from 14 November to 3 December . Unusual gift: This group of Papua New Guinea chloromelanite ceremonial stone adze blades or obligation stones can be bought outright, online or in their South Kensington showroom, for £6,500 . Shoppers will be able to take a look at the selection of the out-of-the-ordinary gifts, both online and in their showroom in South Kensington, London, between 14 November and 3 December. And while each item, hand-picked by experts at the auction house, is priced at more than its auction estimate - shoppers willing to pay the premium will be able to buy without the competition and unpredictability of auction. Any lots that are not bought outright in the three-week period will then go into the 'Interiors' auction on 9 December - where they will be on offer for their auction estimates. Nic McElhatton, Chairman of Christie's South Kensington, said: 'For the first time at Christie's, buyers can secure a handpicked item for a fixed price – they don't have to bid; they can walk in and walk out of Christie's with their purchase, or buy on our website.' New approach: With 'Buy or Bid' shoppers will be able to immediately walk away with this pair of fossilised giant deer or 'Irish elk' antlers . circa 10,500-5,700 B.C. for £10,400, rather than wait for auction . Fine jewellery: An 18th Century white gold and diamond ring, left, is on offer for £3,900 and this Bulgari quartz watch (left) can be bought for £5,200 . Exotic earrings: This pair of Tamil Nadu gold earrings, from South India, 19th century, will cost £3,250 . He added that 'Buy or Bid' should appeal to those new to auction and Christie's regulars. Among the more unusual items up for sale are a striking pair of fossilised giant deer or 'Irish elk' antlers, which date back to roughly 10,500 and 5,700 B.C. Time for something special: A Swiss gilt-brass Atmos clock will be available to buy for £1,040 . Foodies might be drawn to a pair of novelty silver salt shakers from the Victorian era which a Christie's specialist promises 'would be the perfect addition to anyone’s dinner table'. Formed as pillar post boxes, which were first introduced in Britain in 1855, they are enamelled with plaques listing collection times and the tops are pierced with flowers. The specialist added that the shakers, which are housed in a velvet-lined case, 'would make a universally entertaining gift.’ The most expensive lot up for sale is a £13,000 coffee machine which 'epitomises 1930s style and would look wonderful in a contemporary kitchen,' according to another Christie's specialist. It is followed by a 1962 pinball machine - on sale for £10,400 - which offers 'unbeatable' entertainment. Mr McElhatton said that his top pick is the taxidermy dog - a German spitz from the late Victorian era that is mounted in a glass case. The dog, which has a gold ribbon died around its neck, is on sale for £1,950. Mr McElhatton said: 'Recently taxidermy has been enjoying a renaissance in interior design and contemporary art and I think this piece is really cool – I’m even planning to have my own dog Alfie the black Labrador mounted on wheels with a push bar for my grandchildren when his time comes!’","A £13,000 coffee maker and 1962 pinball machine are among 42 lots for sale .

"Have you ever been to Dunstable? The whole place is like a museum. And I don't mean that in a positive way. It's not all quaint cottages, and olde-world England. Far from it. It's a grim relic of a bygone era, a town stuck in the past that may never catch up with the rest of the modern world. Charlie Mulgrew celebrates scoring for Celtic against arch rivals Rangers at Parkhead in April 2012 . Lee McCulloch (centre) grabs Scott McDonald during a heated Old Firm derby in October 2007 . The feisty Old Firm (pictured is Victor Wanyama seeing red in March 2012) is the biggest game in Scotland . I lived there briefly, I think I'm all right now though. The football equivalent of Dunstable is the Scottish domestic scene. People try to avoid it, there is nothing of interest there. And the decline of Scottish club football has been brought into startling focus with this weekend's draw for the League Cup semi-finals. When Celtic and Rangers were paired up for one of the ties, it instantly became the biggest game in the history of Scottish domestic football. That might seem ridiculous but when you think it through, it's true. The Glasgow derby games are always massive, and they're always the biggest games of the season. So that makes this one the biggest Scottish club football will see this campaign. Rangers' Graham Roberts smiles down on Celtic's Owen Archdeacon after hitting him with a tackle in 1987 . Celtic are languishing in the league under Ronny Deila, despite striker John Guidetti's good run of form . But it's so much more than that, and here are the reasons why it's the biggest fixture ever: . 1) Never before has Scotland had to wait so long for an Old Firm clash. When this semi-final takes place, it will be two years and nine months since the last time Celtic and Rangers locked horns. 2) Never before have Rangers had such a massive point to prove. The fans feel they have been let down by the previous owners of the club, and those running the game north of the border. 3) Not for many years have Celtic been in such a shocking state. Strangers to the Champions League and scrapping their way back up the table, jostling for position with the likes of Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Hamilton Academicals as they chase down Dundee United at the top. Neil Lennon preferred to be at Bolton at the foot of the Championship than slum it at Parkhead. It's a period of humiliation for the once-great Celtic Football Club. And while Rangers have been similarly humiliated, Celtic's embarrassment hasn't been imposed on them. 4) Never before has the Scottish domestic game been so moribund that literally everybody who cares about football in Scotland was desperate for this fixture to come in one of the cup competitions. The circumstances both clubs find themselves in, and the hunger for a long-awaited, hotly-anticipated Old Firm game make this, in my opinion, the biggest club game in Scotland ever. It's a sad state for Scottish football to find itself in. Neil Lennon preferred to scrap it out at the foot of the Championship with Bolton than stay north of the border .","Celtic play Rangers in the Scottish League Cup semi-finals .

"Derby County sent out a message to the rest of the Championship when they demolished Wolves 5-0 with a superb exhibition of attacking football at the iPro Stadium. Wolves had no answer to the movement and invention of Derby as Jeff Hendrick and Johnny Russell both scored twice after Ryan Shotton headed the opener to give Steve McClaren's team their biggest win since March. It had been raining steadily throughout the morning and the conditions played a part in Derby's opening goal in the 16th minute when a slip by Ethan Ebanks-Landell forced Matt Doherty to trip Simon Dawkins. VIDEO Scroll down for Wolves and Derby players come together for Remembrance tribute . Derby's double scorers Johnny Russell (left) and Jeff Hendrick (right) celebrate during their win over Wolves . Derby County: Butland, Christie, Keogh, Shotton, Forsyth, Hendrick, Mascarell (Coutts 91'), Hughes, Russell (Calero 84'), Martin, Dawkins (Ibe 75') Substitutes: Buxton, Eustace, Roos,  Best, Ibe . Goals: Shotton, Hendrick (2), Russell (2) Booked: Christie . Wolves: Ikeme, Batth, Ebanks-Landell (Stearman 45'), Ricketts, Saville, McDonald, Henry, Evans (Rowe 75'), Sako Clarke (McAlinden 67') Substitutes: Van La Parra, Jacobs, Kuszczak, Dicko . Booked: Doherty, Ricketts, Saville, Henry . Omar Mascarell whipped in the free kick and although Carl Ikeme did well to get his left hand to Shotton's header, the ball went in off the inside of the post. Wolves caught Derby out with a corner played to the edge of the box for Bakary Sako who fired just over and the visitors wasted an even better chance in the 24th minute. Sako was again involved, drifting past two white shirts before playing in Sam Ricketts who pulled the ball back for George Saville but he shot high and wide from 10 yards. That miss looked even more costly four minutes later when Dawkins chested the ball into the path of Hendrick who made himself enough space to send a low shot fizzing into the bottom right corner from 20 yards. Sako looked the most likely player to get Wolves back in the game but some of his team mates were wasteful in their passing and Derby all but sealed victory with a third goal in the 42nd minute. Derby celebrates their second goal in a demolition of Wolverhampton at The iPro Stadium on Saturday . Russell watches his shot for Derby's third goal fly into the back of the net . A corner was headed back at the far post and although it was half cleared, Russell was allowed to run unchallenged into the area and fire low past Ikeme from 12 yards. It was shocking defending from Wolves who were now looking at damage limitation in the second half although even that was beyond them against a Derby team intent on driving home their superiority. An exchange of passes across the edge of the Wolves box ended with Dawkins seeing a shot deflected over but the visitors were opened up again in the 54th minute when Will Hughes's clever ball inside allowed Hendrick to score with a measured finish from just inside the area. A pumped up Russell shows how fired up the Rams were as they set about dismantling Wolves . Leon Clarke struck the foot of a post a minute later but Derby were now utterly rampant and they made it five on the hour when Craig Forsyth crossed from the left and Russell arrived at the back post to fire into the roof of the net. Wolves kept going but inevitably it was Derby who nearly scored again in stoppage time when Cyrus Christie shot over after Ikeme could only parry a shot from substitute Paul Coutts.

"The brother of murder victim Barbara McCulkin has broken his silence and revealed his sister was 'shaking with fear' before she vanished more than 40 years ago. Police have charged two men, one of whose remote property was dug up earlier this year by cold case murder detectives, over one of Australia's most notorious unsolved killings. The men, Vincent O'Dempsey and Gary Dubois have been charged over the murder of Mrs McCulkin and her two daughters Vicki and Leanne, who have not been seen since January 16, 1974. Graham Ogden, 77, told the Courier Mail he desperately wanted to find the bodies of his slain family members and honour them with a proper burial. 76-year-old Vincent O'Dempsey, who was charged with his co-accused 67-year-old Gary Dubois over the 40-year-old notorious cold murder case of Barbara McCulkin and her daughters Vicki and Leanne . Police say the two men have been charged with three counts of murder, three counts of deprivation of liberty and other serious offences . O'Dempsey was formerly charged with the murder in 1980, but the case was dropped due to insufficient evidence . Ms McCulkin was the estranged wife of Billy McCulkin, a debt collector with underworld connections . 'What I’d like to know is where the remains are, get some sort of closure and have some burial perhaps. Even a few bones, a part of tissue, whatever it might be so we can give them some decent burial,' Mr Ogden said. He opened up about the last time the siblings talked, saying his sister appeared to be scared of what Mr McCulkin, Barbara's estranged husband, was up to. O'Dempsey was a former associate of Billy McCulkin. 'I haven't seen her since, she was terrified, she was shaking with fear,' he told the Courier Mail. The three vanished from their home in Highgate Hill, south of Brisbane, after two men were seen visiting the property more than 40 years ago. Their bodies have never been found. Mr Ogden admitted to a lot of lost sleep and anxiety over the four-decade long case. 'It’s very difficult to understand why it’s taken 40 years to get this far,' he said. 'There’s been lies, cover-up, lies, cover-up.' After reopening the case in January this year - and after a murder charge in 1980 which was later dropped - detectives on Saturday charged O'Dempsey and Dubois with three counts of murder, three counts of deprivation of liberty and other serious offences. They will front Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday. Channel 9 footage showed 76 year old O'Dempsey being driven into a Brisbane police station, where he was later formally charged. In August, Police raided the rural property, which was an alpaca farm allegedly run by O'Dempseys as front for a marijuana operation . Warwick detectives allegedly found barrels filled with bags of cannabis, as well as a loaded gun and over $570,000 in cash . Detective Superintendent Steve Holahan said: 'It's extremely pleasing, particularly for the investigators. It's been a very intense sand relentless investigation.' He added the arrests were the result of years of hard work by many investigators and specialist officers, particularly since the renewed investigation began in January. Since the case was reopened, police have spoken to a number of people in Queensland, leading to them a rural property in Warwick, which O'Dempsey was operating. In August, police raided the rural property, which was an alpaca farm allegedly run by O'Dempseys as front for a marijuana operation. Detectives from the Warwick Criminal Investigation Branch, Homicide Cold Case Unit and State Drug and Serious Crime Illicit Laboratories Investigation Team (ILIT) used an excavator to unearth a shipping container which they believe had been buried for years. LIT members used breathing apparatus to examine the contents of the container. They allegedly found barrels filled with bags of cannabis, as well as a loaded gun and over $570,000 in cash reports Courier Mail. Thomas 'Teddy' Martin was charged with drug and weapons offences. He has no connection to the McCulkin murder case. The McCulkin case has gripped Australia for over 40 years. Mrs McCulkin was the estranged wife of Jimmy McCulkin, a debt collector with underworld connections. Brisbane housewife Barbara McCulkin and her daughters Leanne (left) and Vicky (right) vanished from their Highgate Hill home in inner Brisbane on January 16, 1974 and have never been seen again . Forty years after 13-year-old Vicky McCulkin (left) and 11-year-old Leanne (right) mysteriously disappeared, police have arrested Vincent O'Dempsey and Gary Dubois . On January 16, 1974, she  and her daughters Vicky and Leanne were at home in the Brisbane suburb of Highgate Hill. It was school holidays, and the girls had returned from a birthday party. One of the daughter's friends noticed two men visited the property at an unspecified time, and Mrs McCulkin and her two daughters vanished, never to be seen again. O'Dempsey and Dubois were charged with the three murders in 1980 but the charges were later dropped due to a lack of evidence. Saturday's arrest of the two men who have long been the focus of the case is the most significant breakthrough since the former charges were dropped. Detective Holahan said that the arrests 'reinforce that the Queensland Police and committed to solving serious crimes, regardless of when they were committed or where.' Police have yet to reveal a motive or where they believe the alleged murders took place, however Det. Holahan said 'the investigation looked at all different motives and movements of persons of interest.' A number of potential witnesses gave evidence at Crime and Corruption Commission hearings which looked into the case earlier this year. 'The renewed investigation and use of coercive powers has gathered significant evidence without which the arrests would not have been possible,' Det Supt Holahan said. 'Todays arrest is extremely pleasing, but it's only the first in the prosecution stage,' he said.","Graham Ogden, brother of murder victim Barbara McCulkin reveals his sister was 'shaking with fear' before she disappeared .

"Nobody should be shocked that Alexis Sanchez is doing what he's doing. Anybody who watched him at Barcelona, and Udinese before that, were well aware of this guy's class and quality, his work-rate and attitude. Signing him was a no-brainer, I hope Arsenal didn't waste too much money on scouting reports on a signing who was so obviously going to improve what they had. But fair play to Arsene Wenger for making it happen. I look for shrewdness and value when it comes to judging transfers. Signing players all of us knew were good doesn't make you a sharp operator in the market. And as good as Alexis has been, he didn't solve the more obvious problems holding Arsenal back. And this is where Wenger has to put his reputation on the line. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Theo Walcott return to Arsenal training ahead of Anderlecht . Alexis Sanchez has been in sensational form for Arsenal this season and his signing was an inspired one . Despite the shrewd signing of Sanchez, Arsene Wenger still has plenty of problems to solve at Arsenal . Theo Walcott has made his return after nine months out injured and is a major weapon for Wenger . He has Alexis in fine form, and Theo Walcott ready to return. Those two could cause havoc – I'm excited at the prospect of seeing them both play together for a run of games. But with other areas of the team in need of repair and quality, Wenger needs to finally have a good January transfer window. He needs to sign players who solve problems – just as Jose Mourinho did when he landed Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa this summer. For years the Wenger apologists have used the building of an expensive stadium to excuse his lack of success. They nodded in pathetic agreement when he declared fourth place is a trophy. He built a stadium with his bare hands and did well to reach the Champions League at the same time. That's been the mantra. If that's true, Wenger has to follow it up with years of sustained Premier League and Champions League domination to make it all worthwhile. Let's see if that happens. Arsenal currently find themselves fourth in the Premier League table - a familiar position in recent times . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho brought in Cesc Fabregas to solve his midfield problem in the summer - now Wenger must do likewise at Arsenal in January . Sanchez (centre) celebrates with Walcott and Calum Chambers during Arsenal's 3-0 win over Burnley . That mantra also ignores Wenger's more obvious tactical failings – witness the destruction suffered at Liverpool and Chelsea last season - and the consistent failure to compete with big teams tactically, his inability to change games with substitutions or systems. He keeps making the same errors. But regardless of your view on Wenger – and even Arsenal fans are split on whether the manager should stay or go – they now have Alexis and Walcott, a potentially lethal combination. So what will Wenger do in January to enhance the club's chances of winning the title, or being European champions? Now, the pressure is on Wenger. Just how good is he? What can he do in January? Surely he won't sit back and admire his shiny Sanchez, hoping that Abou Diaby will stay fit to solve his midfield problems? Surely he can spot the weaknesses and address them in January? Wenger issues instructions during a training session ahead of their match against Anderlecht . Wenger leads the team talk as Arsenal train ahead of their Champions League clash with Anderlecht . Previously the Arsenal manager has questioned the quality available in this upcoming window. Well last January is when Chelsea signed Nemanja Matic, a player who would definitely improve Arsenal right now. Wenger has promised to sign a defender in January, he also needs a holding midfielder and a truly top-class goalkeeper in my opinion. The stadium is built, the money is there, no more excuses. The problems in the team seem obvious, but will the manager do his job and solve them? Now is the time even his biggest apologists will surely judge Wenger.

"Hannibal Lecter for PM? A Government official suggested putting psychopaths in charge of the country in the aftermath of a nuclear attack . Recently-released documents have revealed that a Government official suggested putting psychopaths in charge of the country in the aftermath of a nuclear attack. The National Archives has unveiled Exercise Regenerate, a 1982 Home Office plan to keep maintain order in Britain following the nightmarish scenario. Jane Hogg, a scientific officer in the Home Office who worked on the operation, advocated that a psychopath's logic, intelligence, ability to cope in a crisis and lack of morals would make them ideal leaders in the chaos that would ensue after the bomb. 'It is... generally accepted that around one per cent of the population are psychopaths,' she wrote. 'These are people who could be expected to show no psychological effects in the communities which have suffered the severest losses. 'They are very good in crises, as they have no feelings for others, no moral code, and tend to be very intelligent and logical. 'Pre-strike the only solution for these people is to contain them; post-strike, in the immediate aftermath, the formal authorities may well find it advantageous to recruit these people into their organisations as they could prove an exceptionally valuable resource.' Notes on the plan reveal her colleagues did not feel the same way: 'I am not at all sure you convince me. I would regard them as dangerous whether or not recruited into post-attack organisation.' Scroll down for video . Lord Hennessy, author of The Secret State, told the BBC the plan was 'extraordinary' and 'bizarre', but the suggestion was 'stamped on pretty quickly'. 'They always take my breath away,' he said of the Government's Cold War planning. 'The sense of civil servants having to look into the abyss, imagine the unimaginable.' The end of all things: Government officials were forced to consider what steps would need to be taken if Cold War tensions boiled over in to an all-out nuclear exchange. File picture . Lord Hennessy also spoke of a plan to use the Royal Yacht to whisk away the Queen, Prince Phillip and the Home Secretary if nuclear war broke out.

"Sportsmail's Graham Poll casts his eye over Saturday's controversial incidents in the Barclays Premier League - and there were plenty. Poor weekend . Mike Riley and his management team might want to check their appointments system as their inexperienced line-up left more questions than answers this weekend. Perhaps the game of the day was given to Jon Moss, while Roger East and Craig Pawson were trusted with big games in London and clearly angered the managers with some of their decisions. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch... Jon Moss (left) took charge of Manchester City's match with Tottenham, while Craig Pawson (right, talking to John Terry) was the man in the middle at Crystal Palace vs Chelsea . Per Mertesacker and Mathieu Flamini protest to referee Roger East during Arsenal's draw with Hull City . The more experienced referees in Andre Marriner and Martin Atkinson were given routine outings at Southampton and Newcastle respectively. Also, isn’t it time the TV production companies educated their commentators to not mislead those watching? The worst culprit this weekend was Jonathan Pearce, whose description of the Sunderland penalty appeal was embarrassingly inept. Steven Fletcher had played the ball past Fraser Forster in the Southampton goal when the keeper clattered into the attacker. Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster sends Sunderland striker Steven Fletcher flying . Referee Andre Marriner waved away the appeals of Sunderland's John O'Shea (left) and Lee Cattermole . Pearce thought the penalty wasn’t given as the ball had been played away – WRONG – and that had the penalty been given then Forster had to be dismissed – WRONG AGAIN. The ball was in play, so the foul should have been given and Sunderland a lifeline at 0-2. However, as the ball was going wide an obvious goal scoring opportunity was not denied and Forster had to stay on the pitch. Moss penalty fest . The match at the Etihad was remarkable due four penalties being awarded and only two were converted. Penalty 1: This was the worst decision of them all. Frank Lampard threw himself to the ground at feeling the slightest of touches from Erik Lamela. One could argue, as there was contact, technically the penalty award was not wrong but it was so soft it perhaps told us more about Lampard than Moss. Frank Lampard goes down under the slightest contact from Erik Lamela for City's first penalty . Sergio Aguero sweeps home the penalty for the first of his four goals in City's 4-1 win . Penalty 2: The clearest of the four. Younes Kaboul completely wiped David Silva out and looked suitably embarrassed about his challenge. Penalty 3: This was the most interesting. Watching Demichelis, you can see he trips Soldado when tracking him from behind. His eyes give the foul away, which was correctly given, but was the contact inside the penalty area? Replays clearly showed Martin Demichelis make contact with Roberto Soldado outside the box . Penalty 4: This time Moss was absolutely right to award a penalty, as Fazio clearly fouls Aguero to prevent his forward run on to a cross. However, the red card was wrong as it is not clear Aguero would have met the cross or scored. Referee Jon Moss shows Tottenham defender Federico Fazio a red card after pulling down Aguero . Pawson angering Warnock . Craig Pawson clearly upset Neil Warnock with his performance, but to be fair to Pawson pretty much every referee does that. The issues started when Pawson, in keeping with current trends, chose not to caution Damien Delaney for his first tackle, a poor one which led to Chelsea’s first goal. Then he let John Terry escape with a similarly poor tackle, but it was his first and so in keeping with his performance. Crystal Palace players surround referee Craig Pawson after Cesar Azpilicueta's bad tackle . Azpilicueta is shown the red for his shocking tackle in the first half . Pawson brandishes a red card to Crystal Palace's Damien Delaney shortly afterwards . Palace manager Neil Warnock was left fuming by Pawson's performance . There can be no arguments about the red card issued to Cesar Azpilicueta for a shocking tackle, nor the first of Delaney’s yellow cards – he had been given his chance. Then there was his second yellow card, technically correct and a really silly challenge which gave the Chelsea players the opportunity to pressurise the inexperienced Pawson into levelling things up – which he duly did. To see Warnock grabbing his players at the final whistle to instruct them not to shake Pawson’s hand was disappointing but not surprising. His childish antics and attitude to referees is par for the course unfortunately as age does nothing to mellow the angry manager.","Inexperienced referees were entrusted with big games on Saturday .

"A sprawling  estate owned by the late Listerine heiress Bunny Mellon and visited by the Kennedys and royalty has gone on the market for $70 million. Oak Spring Farms  in Upperville, Virginia is up for sale six months after the 103-year-old  horticulturist passed away from stomach cancer at the estate. The 4,000-acre estate includes a 10,000 square-foot-mansion, where guests, including John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy, the Queen and Prince Phillip, would have enjoyed Mellon's extensive art collection, including works by Mark Rothko and Pablo Picasso. Bunny and her husband Paul Mellon, himself a wealthy heir, had numerous homes across the world, but they spent most of their time at Oak Spring, the Washington Post reported. Up for sale: Bunny Mellon passed away in March and now the 4,000-square-acre estate, some of which is pictured, is up for sale for $70 million. It includes a mansion and more than 20 cottages . Paul Mellon built the main mansion in 1941 and after their marriage in 1948, the couple built a small cottage on the property where they lived. Instead, the main house was used to exhibit their large art collection, which is being auctioned off in November by Sotheby's when it could fetch more than $100 million. There are three primary residences on the property, as well as more than 20 cottages - including the guest house where the Kennedys stayed - and multiple barns and shops, according to its listing. There are also garages, a pond, a stream, a working dairy farm, a clock tower, a pool house and even a private air strip. Photos taken by Architectural Digest also reveal an extensive library inside. Luxury: Another image of the sprawling estate shows a private airstrip (top) used by residents and guests . Extensive gardens and greenhouses at the property  reveal Bunny's passion for gardening, while a bronze statue of Kentucky Derby winner Sea Hero and two stables with 43 stalls are also a nod to Paul Mellon's love for breeding top race horses. The Mellons' main home, the cottage, is not part of the sale. The home, 100 acres of land and Bunny's horticultural library were bequeathed to the Gerard B. Lambert Foundation, a philanthropic nonprofit named after her father. Her wealth first came from Listerine, which her grandfather Jordan Lambert invented, before she married banker Paul Mellon, who inherited his own fortune from his father Andrew Mellon, himself a banker and philanthropist, as well as the Secretary of the Treasury between 1921 and 1932. Well-connected: She is pictured with Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961. The two women became firm friends and Mellon, a self-taught horticulturist, designed the Rose Garden and flowers for John F. Kennedy's funeral . The couple - one of the wealthiest in America at the time of their 1948 marriage - delved into a life of philanthropy and supporting the arts. Bunny was invited to the White House soon after JFK was elected, and the  first lady leaned on her for  tips on interior design and entertaining that became a hallmark of the Kennedy White House. Bunny and Jackie were such close friends that Mellon chartered the private jet that flew the two women to Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral after his 1968 assassination. She also redesigned the Rose Garden after decades of neglect and she designed the floral arrangements for President Kennedy's funeral a few years later. She entertained Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip at Oak Spring in 1957 and years later, she also played host to Prince Charles and Princess Diana. Bunny's husband died in 1999, aged 91, and she shied away from the spotlight until her death in March. She also became blind in her later years. 'Richest couple in America': Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon is pictured in 1987 with her husband Paul Mellon - himself an heir and successful banker. He passed away in 1999 and their estate will go to family and charities . Despite long trying to avoid publicity, she was thrust back into the public spotlight as a major donor to the now-disgraced John Edwards' failed 2008 presidential bid. Edwards was indicted in 2011 for using what prosecutors alleged was campaign money, including $750,000 from Mellon, to hide mistress Rielle Hunter and their child during his 2008 campaign. When she died, she left her fortunes to charities including the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond. Her grandchildren were left money, real estate and benefits of a family trust, while a worker who helped her run her properties was granted lifetime occupancy of a farmhouse.","The Listerine heiress and horticulturist passed away at the Oak Spring Farms estate in Upperville, Virginia in March .

"Stuart Broad has spoken of his shock at hearing that Australian batsman Phil Hughes suffered a life-threatening head injury and offered his sympathy to the 22-year-old bowler who delivered the delivery. The England all-rounder — whose nose was broken in two places when a ball from India fast bowler Varun Aaron smashed through his visor during the fourth Test last summer — talked about the incident which left Hughes fighting for his life and New South Wales fast bowler Sean Abbott requiring counselling. Phillip Hughes collapsed and hit the ground face first after being struck in the head by a bouncer . Hughes sorts out his kit between overs before he was struck on the head by a bouncer .

Jason Gillespie . Our thoughts are with Phil Hughes and his family. Feeling for everyone that was at the game too. #staystrong . ‘I woke up yesterday and had a text from my mum saying “Awful news about Phil Hughes”,’ the Mail on Sunday columnist told Sportsmail. ‘Immediately my heart sank and I thought “What on earth has happened?” I saw he’d been hit on the head and was in a critical condition. It’s desperate news. The cricketing world is hoping Phil pulls through. ‘No one who plays cricket wants to see these sorts of injuries. Everyone is just praying Phil wakes up in the next 24 hours and is ok. ‘As a fast bowler you bowl a short ball with aggressive intent but then as soon as you hit someone your entire body stops and all you care about is the wellbeing of that person. ‘You’ve got to feel sorry for the lad who bowled the bouncer but he can’t feel any guilt that he bowled a bouncer. That’s part of a bowler’s armoury. He’s done nothing wrong.’ Broad’s own injuries last summer amounted to a badly broken nose and extensive bruising after he top-edged a delivery into his face. As a fast bowler capable of hitting speeds of up to 90mph, the 28-year-old is aware of the pitfalls of what is sometimes mistakenly considered to be a genteel sport. ‘It takes bravery to play cricket,’ he said. ‘The ball can come down at great speed and as a batsman you can take all sorts of blows. I was very fortunate. I broke my nose in two places but I don’t have any long-term problems. My helmet took a lot of the pace off the ball. You saw a piece break off and that actually took a lot of speed off the ball. ‘It looks as if Phil was hit straight on the head. At the sort of speed the ball is bowled at, it is obviously a very worrying time. ‘I remember hitting Craig Kieswetter in 2010 and he went down for four or five minutes. We were encouraging him to go off the field but he carried on batting. Stuart Broad was left badly bruised in the summer after being hit by a bouncer from Varun Aaron . ‘I also hit Chris Rogers at the MCG in the Boxing Day Test match. It hit him so hard on his helmet he had to replace it altogether. ‘When something like this happens it puts everything into perspective. Sport is about rivalries but it’s also about having camaraderie and friends for life.’ Hughes was last night in a critical condition in a Sydney hospital after emergency surgery to stop bleeding on his brain caused by the blow to the back of his head. ‘You’ve seen with all the messages of support what a popular figure Phil is,’ said Broad. ‘Everyone is desperate for good news. You see guys get hit in the head in sport, you see boxers get knocked out and get up again. The whole cricketing world is just hoping Phil gets up from this.’ Tim Nielsen from South Australia Cricket addresses the media after Hughes was put in an induced coma .

"U2's disastrous album giveaway has received the SNL treatment as it became the butt of a joke about the nude celebrity selfies hack. The show, hosted this week by Chris Pratt, addressed the latest leak of nude celebrity photos - which involved Ariana Grande, who gave tonight's musical performances. In a word of advice to victims of the widespread iCloud hack, Colin Jost said: 'You could always hide them in that free U2 album, no one will look there'. Scandal: Saturday Night Live's Colin Jost addressed the iCloud hack which exposed celebrities' nude selfies . Mocking: He suggested victims of the hack should hide their photos in the U2 album that nobody wants . The joke will come as yet another shattering blow to Apple as the firm desperately tries to tighten its iCloud security and advise angry iPhone users on how to delete the album Songs Of Innocence. Last week, Apple launched a special ‘button’ for iTunes customers – simply so they can delete his band’s latest album from their accounts. Thousands of users complained when they were given a free copy of Songs Of Innocence without asking for it. As Apple chief executive Tim Cook desperately tried to reconcile the situation, Apple executives have been grappling to tighten security following the nude selfies hack. Apple has admitted it is 'actively investigating' the claims that a flaw in the 'Find My iPhone' function of its iCloud service may have helped a hacker to steal nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence and '100 other celebrities'. Naked photos hacked from celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Rhianna and Amber Heard are still believed to be easily accessible on social media sites. Return to screens: The current affairs sketch was the first of this season, which launched tonight . Two topless images of Rihanna appeared online via 4chan and Reddit on Sunday while Heard has been one hardest-hit celebrities, with more than 50 nude snaps of her surfacing. According to TMZ, one featured a message believed to be for her fiancé Johnny Depp. Despite stringent policies about removing abusive content, the images remained in the public sphere today - and were believed to be easily accessible on Twitter. Nearly 24 hours after the first publication of the images on September 1, Apple issued a statement, but the tech giant couldn't say how the alleged breach occurred and didn't offer any guarantee to its hundreds of millions of customers worldwide that the service is safe to use. 'We take user privacy very seriously and are actively investigating this report,' Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris told MailOnline. Executives hoped the long-awaited launch of the iPhone 6 on September 6 would deflect attention from the scandal. But on September 15, Apple chief executive Tim Cook announced that all 500 million iTunes customers would automatically receive a digital version of the album in their accounts ahead of its release next month. Hacked? Ariana Grande, who performed tonight, claims the shots that 4chan claimed to be of her were not real . But it seems many were not impressed, with thousands of protests on social media. Some customers said they felt as though the album had been forced upon them by Apple. To make things worse, others complained that they could not find an easy way to remove it from their iTunes libraries. The protests prompted Apple to create the online tool allowing customers to get rid of the album. It comes with a message: ‘If you would like U2’s Songs Of Innocence removed from your iTunes music library and iTunes purchases, you can choose to have it removed. ‘Once the album has been removed from your account, it will no longer be available for you to redownload as a previous purchase. If you later decide that you want the album, you will need to get it again.’ Apple’s senior vice president Eddy Cue announced two weeks ago that 33 million iTunes users had so far accessed the album. He described the figure as record-breaking, although he did not elaborate.","Saturday Night Live mocked two scandals to hit Apple this month .

"Texas groceries had likely removed by Sunday morning all of the nearly 91,000 pounds of ground beef from store shelves that were subject to a recall due to possible contamination from tiny pieces of metal, an executive at Sam Kane Beef Processors said. Sam Kane Beef Processors, based in Corpus Christi, Texas, recalled the beef shipped between Sept. 9 and Sept. 18 to Texas retail outlets, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a news release on Saturday. Consumers in four separate incidents reported finding pieces of metal about 3 mm in size in beef products, and one of them reported getting a chipped tooth, the USDA said.

The stores began removing the meat from shelves immediately and it is likely none remained on Sunday, said Herb Meischen, senior vice president of sales and marketing for Sam Kane. 'It was not a food safety issue,' general manager Alfred Bausch told CNN. 'It was a foreign object and the foreign object was very small.' 'The products [...] bear the establishment number '337' inside the USDA Mark of Inspection,' the agency said in the release.

"Husband charged: Jerry Canfield, 72, is accused of shooting his wife of 37 years, Joann Canfield, in the head at her own request . A 72-year-old Northern California man has been charged with murder for what his attorney says was the mercy killing of his dementia-stricken wife. Jerry ‘JC’ Canfield, of Alameda, was arraigned last week on a murder charge in the shooting death of his wife of 37 years, Joann Canfield. Police say Canfield walked into the Alameda police station October 26 to confess that he killed his 72-year-old wife by shooting her in the head. He allegedly told investigators the two had previously agreed he would end her life if an illness left her in constant pain. Assistant Public Defender Drew Steckler said police found physical evidence at the crime scene that corroborated what Canfield told them, including that he left a dozen red roses at his wife's bedside. Mr Canfield is being held in jail without bail. He is scheduled to appear in court to enter a plea November 14. The couple's neighbors in Alameda have spoken out in Canfield's defense, saying that the couple had been inseparable. 'You know, you've heard of being in love? Well, they were that,' next door neighbor Jose De Dios told ABC 7 News. Scroll down for video . Touching gesture: Joann Canfield was found dead from a gunshot wound in her bed, flanked by a dozen red roses left there by her husband . Another neighbor, Bridget Milet, also confirmed that the couple were as close as two people can possibly be. ‘Whenever I'd see them, it restored my faith in married people,’ Milet told KTVU. ‘They just loved each other.’ The 72-year-old woman had developed dementia and her condition was rapidly deteriorating. De Dios said Jerry Canfield once told him that his wife was seeing little demons that were chasing her around the house, causing her to trip and fall often. A month ago, Mr Canfield was forced to put her in a nursing home, but his neighbor said he would spend every waking moment by her side. Memorial: Neighbors have been bringing flowers and other mementos to the Canfields' apartment in Alameda . On October 25, a day before the shooting, the husband brought Joann Canfield back home. Local residents recalled seeing the woman looking disoriented and unable to recognize anyone. The following day, the 72-year-old man placed a bouquet of roses next to his wife's bed and shot her in the head to end her pain, as the two had agreed in advance, according to an affidavit. Canfield then dressed up and drove down to the Alameda police station, where he told an officer that he wanted to make a confession.","Jerry Canfield, 72, charged with murder for shooting his wife of 37 years, Joann, in the head in what his attorney says was a 'mercy killing'

"Sara Gebert has not eaten anything in two years, and that's not because she has been on some extreme diet. The 19-year-old New Jersey girl has been diagnosed with an extremely rare disorder called Chronic Intestinal Pseudo Obstruction – a condition where the body behaves as if there is an intestinal obstruction, even though there isn't one. Only 150 people around the world are diagnosed with CIPO every year. The disease has no known cure. Fearless: Sara Gebert, 19, is battling a very rare disorder that has left her unable to eat or drink anything . Rare: Chronic Intestinal Pseudo Obstruction is a condition where the body behaves as if there is an intestinal obstruction, even though there isn't one . Symptoms of the disorder include nausea, vomiting, pain, weight loss, abdominal distention and diarrhea. It took doctors months to correctly identify Miss Gebert’s illness that was causing her to throw up as many as 60 times a day on an empty stomach. In order to stay alive, Sara is fed overnight through an IV tube, which pumps nutrients directly into her bloodstream. She also has to drain her stomach 24 hours a day, seven days a week, because her body is unable to contain its own digestive contents. Over the past two years, the competitive softball pitcher has shed 30lbs and was forced to drop out of Fairleigh Dickinson University because she was often too sick to get out of bed. The Union Township teen will have to rely on IV fluids for the rest of her life, unless she decides to undergo a series of invasive surgeries and go on medications to manage her symptoms, which are not covered by her insurance. ‘There are days where you're just like, “How am I going to do this every day for the rest of my life, I don't want to do it,""’ Gebert tells NBC Philadelphia. Staying alive: Sara is fed overnight through an IV tube, which pumps nutrients directly into her bloodstream . Daily struggle: She has to drain her stomach 24 hours a day, seven days a week, because her body is unable to contain its own digestive contents . In an effort to raise awareness of the little-known disease, Sara and her friends have founded an organization called Sara's Army and set up a website to raise funds for her medical treatment through the sale of wristbands. On the website CaringBridge, Sara wrote about the onset of her incurable illness, which began in January 2013. At first, the teen believed that she had a bad case of the stomach flu and brushed it off, but days passed and her condition did not get any better. Her doctor initially thought that the problem was in her appendix, but it was quickly ruled out, along with a gallbladder inflammation. A month later, Sara underwent an endoscopy but it has failed to shed light on what was ailing her, and she was only getting worse. The girl spent months bouncing around various hospitals, from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to the famed Mayo Clinic, without getting a definitive diagnosis. Life-changing condition: Sara has lost 30lbs and was forced to drop out of college because she got too sick . Heroic effort: With little funding set aside for CIPO research, Sara has taken it upon herself to raise awareness of the illness . ‘One time a doctor told me he was here to help me with my “pseudo problem.” That's when I get on my soapbox,’ Gebert tells NJ.com. Finally last November, a team of gastroenterologists were able to determine that Sara has come down with a case of CIPO. For the foreseeable future, Sara will have to rely on an IV line for all her nutritional needs, but it is not a sustainable solution because at any moment she could develop a life-threatening infection that would land her in the hospital. One option open to her is to undergo a mutivisceral transplant, but only three clinics in the US perform this type of complicated surgery. The 19-year-old laments the fact that some doctors treat her disorder as a fake disease, and that there are no charities dedicated to raising money toward finding a cure. But she remains optimistic. Above all, Gebert wants to be treated like a normal teenager. 'I'd just like to be treated the same way I was before I got sick,’ she says. Sara hopes to return to college and study biology. Before she became ill, Gebert aspired to become a doctor, and now she wants a career in medicine more than ever.","Sara Gebert, 19, from New Jersey, has been diagnosed with Chronic Intestinal Pseudo Obstruction .

"These heart-warming pictures show the moment a baby giraffe came down to earth with quite a bump after its mother gave birth. Two friendly giraffes stood guard from hyenas as the mother spent 30 minutes patiently waiting for the birth. Slowly but surely the calf begins to emerge, with the mother momentarily dropping to all fours before standing straight again, causing the baby to fall around six feet on to its back. Scroll down for video . Birth: As two giraffes stand guard from hyenas out of shot, this giraffe starts to give birth on the savanna of the Masai Mara National Reserve, in Kenya . Down on all fours: The mother giraffe bends her thin legs until she is down on her knees as she tries to squeeze the calf out, which slowly begins to emerge . The heart-warming pictures, taken by tour guide Andreas Knausenberger, show the baby giraffe coming down to earth with quite a bump after its mother gives birth . Following its ungraceful entrance to the world, the calf, which spent around 15 months in the womb, lifts its head up moments later as its mother looks down on her newborn. Just minutes later, the mother's two friends come over to see the baby, watching as the giraffe begins to lovingly lick its offspring clean. One of the mother's friends even bends down to help, as the calf begins to perk up and take in the world for the first time. As the newborn quickly discovers, taking your first steps is never easy, as it stumbles around and falls over several times. Eventually the calf gets to its feet and tentatively edges its way towards its mother for a feed. Later the baby was seen plodding carefully around, its mother following behind as it tried to continue preening the playful calf. Nonchalant: The mother giraffe seems somewhat unbothered considering she has just given birth in full view of a group of tourists and two of her friends . Loving: As the calf raises its head and takes in its first view of the outside world, the mother bends down to to tend to her newborn, tenderly nudging its head . Friends: Another giraffe, which had been standing guard, wanders over to inspect the new calf as the mother starts licking her offspring clean . Speaking of the moment of birth, Mr Knausenberger, 32, from Germany, said: 'It was so special - I've never seen anything like this before.' What do we have here? Two other giraffes stand behind the mother as they crane their long necks to try and get a first look at the newborn calf . Baby steps: The calf stumbles and its short legs quiver as it tries to get to its feet for the first time, failing at several attempts to do so . Tour operator Andreas Knausenberger, 32, captured the miracle of birth after stumbling on it by accident during a safari in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. He spoke of the moment he and his tour group spotted the giraffe giving birth: 'It was so special - I've never seen anything like this before,' he said. 'When we approached the giraffes we noticed something dark hanging out of one of their backs and we immediately realized she was in labour. 'Not to disturb them, we waited a good distance away and it was really interesting to watch the others guard the one in labour as there were some hyenas sniffing around.' 'After about 30 minutes the baby came out bit by bit and finally fell about two metres on to its back,' Mr Knausenberger, from Extrakt Exclusiv Travel, said. 'Only 15 seconds later, the new-born lifted its head and the mother started cleaning it carefully. 'After another half an hour - and several failed attempts - the baby finally managed to get up on its long feet and started looking for milk.' Success: After just half an hour in the outside world, the calf eventually clambers to its feet and tries to take its first steps in the Kenyan safari . And we're off: The calf, which spent 15 months in its mothers womb, carefully plods along as its mother tries to keep up with and continue preening it .","Heart-warming pictures show the adorable moment a giraffe gives birth in the Masai Mara National Reserve, in Kenya .

"Compensation payouts for pothole damage to cars have soared by up to a quarter in the past year with flood-hit areas facing the highest bills, new figures show. According to a figures released today, councils worst hit by last winter’s floods saw a rise in claims of up to 26 percent as motorists put in compensation claims. In total, more than 26,000 compensation claims have been made in the past financial year - an increase of 13 per cent on the previous year. Common claims include potholes ruining wheel rims to punctured tyres and damaged suspension. Compensation payouts for pothole damage to cars have soared by up to a quarter in the past year with flood-hit areas facing the highest bills, new figures show . Councils have also had to pay out more than £5million in compensation to drivers in the past two years for pothole damage to cars, according to the statistics, disclosed by 143 highways authorities in response to a Freedom of Information request. Of the authorities to respond, Wiltshire has paid out the highest amount in compensation so far this year, spending £154,871.72 to settle 770 claims. Vale of Glamorgan Council has already paid out more than £152,000 in compensation, Surrey County Council has paid out £134,000 and Devon County Council has paid out £91,000. Data from councils show the A509 in Milton Keynes and Fir Tree Road in Banstead, Epsom Downs are some of the worst roads for potholes in the UK resulting in 123 and 116 compensation claims respectively since 2012. Soaked: Britain experienced some of the worst storms on record last winter with some areas getting nearly twice as much rainfall as usual, which caused flash flooding and left many roads under water . According to the report from LV= Road Rescue, there are now so many potholes on British roads that one in six drivers have been left with damage to their cars in the past 12 months as a result of poor road surfaces, paying out £118 for the average repair cost. The most common problems include tyre damage (49 percent), suspension problems (34 percent) and broken wheel rims (28 percent). Yet motorists have not only had to pay out to fix damage to their cars as a result of potholes, one in six (16 percent) drivers have swerved to avoid a pothole and nearly had an accident. 'Persistently heavy rain and flooding earlier in the year created the perfect storm for Britain’s pothole epidemic,' said Peter Horton, Managing Director of LV= Road Rescue said. 'Councils therefore face difficult choices in the roads they prioritise for repair this winter. Motorists should protect themselves by keeping an eye out for potholes and keeping speeds down - particularly in wet weather when potholes may be filled by rain.' Potholes, which can damage the suspension and wheels of a car, as well as burst tyres, develop when rain or floodwater collects in cracks on the road surface. Britain experienced some of the worst storms on record last winter with some areas getting nearly twice as much rainfall as usual, which caused flash flooding and left many roads under water. Washout: The Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, pictured under water earlier this year, was the hardest hit with a 26 percent rise in the number of compensation claims . Flooding hell: The number of claims made in Kent was up 23 percent. Tonbridge was flooded over Christmas, with people taking boats to get around the town . As a result, councils in the areas with some of the heaviest rainfall have seen their compensation claims soar. The Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames was the hardest hit with a 26 percent rise whilst Kent that saw a 23 percent increase and Wiltshire was up 21 percent. Despite greater investment in maintaining and fixing road surfaces and potholes, road maintenance in the UK is still severely under-funded, with around £63 spent per driver per year on maintaining and fixing roads. Short-term fixes are often chosen over longer-term solutions, with one in six (16 percent) councils saying they usually temporarily fix potholes rather than resurface the area, and according to the councils, the average British road is resurfaced just every 58 years. 1. Wiltshire Council .

RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: 'It is easy to see why we are in this situation. 'While recent harsh winters have exacerbated and highlighted the poor state of our roads, the seeds of our current problems were sown decades ago. 'Back in the mid 1980s local road surfaces were being repaired and replaced once every 12 years or so. Today the rate is once every 25 years.' He went on: 'Spending on roads has fallen by almost a quarter in real terms over the past five years. 'The future looks equally bleak. Road spending is not ring fenced and councils say more and more of their limited funds are being diverted to statutory obligations like providing environmental services and social care.' The figures have sparked a call by the Local Government Association for an extra £1 billion a year to be spent on roads. The LGA’s transport spokesman, Peter Box,  said the floods which ravaged Britain between October 2013 and February this year left many stretches of road “crumbling and warned that another cold wet winter could mark the “tipping point” for the local road network. '“Despite spiralling multi-million pound compensation costs and funding cuts, councils still fixed two million potholes last year,”' he said. “'But we need long-term funding to tackle the ever-growing £12 billion roads repair backlog facing the nation. '“Last year’s floods caused widespread destruction on our roads leaving motorists to drive on crumbling highways that are increasingly unfit for the 21st century. “'Our fear is that another harsh winter could be the tipping point for our roads. “'Tackling this crisis must be a national priority. That is why we are calling for the Government to inject a further £1 billion a year into roads maintenance by investing the equivalent of just two pence per litre of existing fuel duty.”' The Department for Transport said £168 million was made available in April this year for three million emergency pothole repairs in addition to £10 billion that councils will receive for local road maintenance between 2010 and 2012. A spokesman said: 'Potholes are a menace for all road users. This Government has taken action to improve road conditions by spending £1 billion more on local roads maintenance over this parliament than in 2005-10. 'Between 2010 and 2021 we have committed a total of £10 billion to making roads safer and easier to use, improvements that will make a real difference to people right across the country.'","More than 26,000 compensation claims made in the past financial year .

"It sounds like a horror film: giant prehistoric spiders that lurk in caves and spin huge webs to catch prey. But in reality Niall Doran's nature documentary, set to premier in Tasmania, about the dinner plate-sized Tasmanian cave spider is meant to tell an arachnid love story. Under the biologist's direction, a film crew has spent months in dark, musty caves in central northern Tasmania trying to capture, for the first time, the habits of the world's oldest species of spider. The dinner-plate sized Tasmanian cave spider (pictured). Filmmakers Joe Shemesh and Doug Thost have spent months in dark, wet Tasmanian caves recording the lives of the shy and light-sensitive spider . A short film showing the making of a documentary about a prehistoric spider which lives in Tasmanian caves is to make an international premiere . The result are set to be 'Sixteen Legs', a documentary which has already drawn international attention. On November 9 a short, 25 minute production - 'Sixteen Legs: Spider Love' - showing the making of the documentary, will concurrently premiere in Launceston and as a finalist in the Canadian Banff Mountain Film and Book Festival. For Doran, the productions are the result of a fascination which has lasted more than two decades. 'They are an intriguing creature with a leg-span of up to 18cm, which date back to the first age of the dinosaurs,' Doran told AAP. Unlike common garden spiders which have a life span of one or two years, the Tasmanian cave spider lives for decades and takes nine months to hatch from an egg. Describing the creatures, Doran said they're much larger than a classic huntsman, and similar in structure to a redback, but without the distinctive colour and many times bigger. 'They are very elegantly built with an arched back and slender legs,' he said of the creature which is found exclusively on the island state, but rarely if ever seen because of its sensitivity to light. Niall Doran's nature documentary is set to premier in Tasmania, about the dinner plate-sized Tasmanian cave spider is meant to tell an arachnid love story. The Tasmanian cave spider (pictured) is equipped with fangs and venom. The arachnid is part of a nature documentary set to make its international premiere . 'And yes, they bite.' The Tasmanian cave spider is equipped with fangs and venom. But while a bite would be painful for a human, based on the small number of recorded incidents, the venom doesn't seem to be problematic. The spider typically eats cave crickets and spins an intricate horizontal web stretching several metres to catch the prey as they fall from the rock ceiling. But life isn't all good for the male of the species. 'They have to perform this fascinating courtship dance to attract the female, who are often taken by such surprise that they lash out and eat their hopeful partner,' he said. All these habits and more will be captured by the documentary, for which Doran is in discussions over broadcast rights. Joe Shemesh, Doug Thost and Piers Johnson spent up to 19 hours a day filming in the caves, coming out only to sleep and recharge equipment. British science fiction author Neil Gaiman, who has worked on shows including Dr Who, is collaborating with the Tasmanian film makers who hope the documentary will be ready for release in 2015.

"Ronny Deila has warned Cardiff City it will take an inflated fee for them to have any chance of prising Anthony Stokes away from Celtic in January. Sportsmail revealed this week that the Championship club were weighing up a £1.5million offer for the Republic of Ireland forward. Deila, however, has made it clear he has no wish to part with Stokes, who has contributed seven goals this term despite operating mainly on the left flank. The Parkhead manager believes the 26-year-old can further improve his physical condition but insisted he has been impressed by his mentality – an aspect of his character the former Hibs player has faced criticism over in the past. Anthony Stokes' form for Celtic has drawn transfer interest from Championship side Cardiff . ‘We want to build the best team we can for Celtic and I think the January transfer window will see us strengthen rather than weaken,’ said Deila as he prepared for tonight’s Europa League tie against Dinamo Zagreb. ‘We will see what possibilities there are. We always look at the players and think of what is the best for the future for the club and the right way to go. ‘Nobody is for sale - but then everyone is for sale as well! If someone comes in with money where we can’t say no, then of course we must think about it. But they are all very expensive. ‘I think Anthony is happy and I’ve been talking to him a lot. I’m not afraid. He’s under contract and I’m in control of the situation.’ Stokes signed a new three-year deal in October of last year and Deila views his adaptability as an asset. The 26-year-old striker has scored seven goals so far this season for the Glasgow club . ‘Anthony has played well on the left but he is not there yet,’ he said. ‘He needs to improve physically so he can run even more and he can get even sharper. ‘He is an important player because he is scoring goals and he is a very intelligent player. He knows how to play and he can also link up well with the other players. ‘He needs to get his fitness up for the highest level but his attitude is very good.’ Stokes joined Celtic as a central striker in 2010 and has netted 75 times for the club. Deila isn’t ruling out a return to that preferred role in the future. ‘I think it is possible,’ said the Norwegian. ‘He has to show himself positively in the games and the training. ‘When he does play as a striker he goes out to the left all of the time. So I don’t think it is that different - and he enjoys playing on the left. He has also played some very good games there. ‘He has the talent but he has to keep working the way he has been and then he will get better every day.’ Stokes (centre) trains with Leigh Griffiths (left) ahead of Celtic's Europa League tie with Dinamo Zagreb . John Guidetti has been Celtic’s main goal threat this term but his ineligibility in Europe means £2m signing Stefan Scepovic could be given a chance to convince in Croatia this evening. Captain Scott Brown has been left at home as he is one booking away from a European ban. James Forrest is being rested following his recent return to action, while injured trio Jason Denayer, Charlie Mulgrew and Mikael Lustig also miss out. Celtic are guaranteed to finish second in Group D but there is approximately £160,000 up for grabs in prize money this evening. Victory would take their total Europa League earnings from UEFA to almost £2m. It would also bolster the club’s co-efficient, which impacts upon the seedings for next season’s Champions League qualifiers. ‘It is an important game ahead of the next round and also for getting seeded next year,’ insisted Deila. ‘These are all important things we have to think of. It is also important to use this game to make the team even better in European games away from home. We want to get a victory because we know that would be a very good achievement. ‘Some players have not travelled but when people get their chance it is up to them to take it. It is up to the players coming in to say: “Ronny, I want to play.” Celtic manager Ronny Deila speaks in Croatia ahead of his team's clash with Dinamo Zagreb . ‘There is also prize money from this game and this is good. It would be a positive even though we know it won’t be huge. ‘We will go to a training camp soon (in Gran Canaria next month) as we want to improve and all the money that comes in can help us improve as a unit.’ Dinamo Zagreb boss Zoran Mamic also dismissed talk of tonight’s clash being meaningless and insisted his players must leave everything on the field. Mamic is demanding maximum commitment from Dinamo after a disappointing European campaign that has yielded just three points from five Group D games. ‘I do not agree there is no imperative to win,’ he said. ‘We can’t qualify but all other motives are there. We should be prepared to die to win. ‘I will play my strongest possible team. We will look at the game and play to win. ‘It doesn’t matter if Celtic make changes. Players who are at Celtic certainly do not lack talent. Whoever comes in, it will not be easy. ‘We want to win this last European game. It improves our image and it carries prestige. It would also give us coefficient points and money.’","Anthony Stokes the subject of transfer interest from Cardiff .

"Members of Generation Y are still thought of as lazy by older executives and managers, with millennials placing more importance on finding meaning in their work rather than attempting to climb the corporate ladder. Generation expert Tamara Erickson said that industry executives often view Generation Y workers as not wanting to 'pay their dues.' One of Australia's top chefs, Luke Mangan, has echoed this, claiming apprentices have a lazy work ethic which hurt both the restaurant industry and their futures. One of Australia's top chefs, Luke Mangan, has echoed this, claiming apprentices have a lazy work ethic which hurt both the restaurant industry and their futures . When Mr Mangan, who now also creates menus for Virgin Australia, started his apprenticeship nearly 30 years ago, he was working between 70 and 80 hour weeks. The 44-year-old has been working in the industry for decades, and is set to open his 20th restaurant this year. When Mr Mangan, who now also creates menus for Virgin Australia, started his apprenticeship nearly 30 years ago, he was working between 70 and 80 hour weeks. He claims that apprentices now 'look at their watch at 38 hours', reported news.com.au. 'You do not learn a profession by taking short cuts or just doing the hours you have to do,' Mr Mangan said. 'You’ve got to put in hard work and commit to it and I think I’ve done that.' However, Ms Erickson, who was listed as one of the World’s Top 50 Business Thinkers in 2013, said that millennials are often seen as lazy or entitled as a result of world events which have shaped a belief that the world is unpredictable. Influenced by the September 11 attacks and other acts of terror has shaped Generation Y's view that life is best lived in the moment, to the fullest, as they cannot foresee what might happen. 'Frankly, [Gen Y] don’t want to do some grubby job for five years in the hope it pays off,' she told BRW. She encourages managers to encourage millennials to be innovative, and to be flexible enough to allow their younger employees to explore different avenues of their approach to work. Generation expert Tamara Erickson said that industry executives often view Generation Y workers as not wanting to 'pay their dues.' 'One way to make even menial tasks more challenging is to let them [Gen Ys] figure out how to do them,' she says. A recent study by Deloitte revealed that collaboration and teamwork were extremely important to Generation Y, with 59% reporting that they worked better in teams, as opposed to 33% of baby boomers. Global HR firm Randstad highlighted this trend in a survey they released which indicated that two thirds of Australians have reported that they spend far more time collaborating with colleagues than five years ago. Driven by technology developments which allow for employees to communicate, the study has shown that $46 billion was added to the Australian economy through collaboration. This serves to emphasize Ms Erickson's belief that encouraging Generation Y to explore new avenues for working may improve productivity. 'We’ve seen workplaces really change quite significantly over last 20 years or so,' Steve Shepherd, employment market analyst at Randstad, told news.com.au. 'We now have technology that enables us to share information in real-time, and gen Y is much stronger in that area. It’s also a product of how they’ve grown up,' he said. 'The education system now focuses much more on collaboration — working on group assignments, for example. It’s really become second nature for them.' 'One of the things that came through in the study is if you measure performance on outcomes that are individually driven, then you’re not necessarily encouraging collaborative behaviour,' he said. Work-life balance is also important to Generation Y, who are far more entrepreneurial, value life outside of work and want to travel. Millennials also desire an employer who is supportive, and understands a desire for flexible hours and is open to the option of working from home, reported Hays. For Mr Mangan, this may translate into self-entitlement in work ethic. 'People want to get somewhere too quick, they don’t want to put in the hard work,' he said. 'There are no shortcuts in this industry.'","Celebrity chef Luke Mangan has claimed that Generation Y apprentices have a lazy work ethic which hurt the restaurant industry .

"Tinder is planning to unveil a new ‘undo’ button that will give users a second chance to review potential matches that they have already swiped left and rejected. There is currently no way to contact a user on the dating app once you have chosen to dismiss their profile and swiped left to erase them from your profile forever – even if the rejection was accidental. But now users of the popular app will have the chance to reclaim lost loves thanks to the new feature, which is being released as part of a new premium upgrade called Tinder Plus. Giving love a second chance: Tinder is planning to unveil a new 'undo' button that will let users reconsider matches they may have accidentally rejected . The undo button is something users have been asking for since Tinder’s launch, according to Forbes. Indeed, a quick Google search brings up multiple Reddit conversations on the necessity of such a function. Another new perk of the premium plan is a travel feature that will let users 'jump across the country and globe, swiping through potential matches in Barcelona and Boston, Rio and Rome.' Tinder Places, a third premium feature that could roll out at a later time, would help users meet new people based on venues they frequent, such as bars, stadiums, museums and parks. The announcement was made by Tinder CEO Sean Rad, who just announced that he's stepping down from his post. The 28-year-old will remain on Tinder's board and serve as president when the new CEO is chosen by the app's majority owner, IAC. Changes: Sean Rad, who just revealed that he's stepping down from his post as Tinder's CEO, announced the plan for a premium service at the Forbes Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia . When explaining the company's decision to launch the premium plan, Mr Rad said: 'We are adding features users have been begging us for. They will offer so much value we think users are willing to pay for them.' He added: 'We had to get our product and growth right first. Revenue has always been on the road map.' The app, which has become popular around the globe, sees 1.2 billion profiles swiped and almost 14 million matches made every day. The upgrade will mean users can still use the free version, but a fee will give them access to additional features.","The new feature is part of Tinder Plus, a new premium service for paying customers that will roll out soon ."

"Fizzy drinks appear to speed up the rate at which cells in the body age, a study has found . Sugary soft drinks may accelerate ageing as much as smoking, new research shows. Experts found the damage fizzy drinks cause to health goes beyond making people fat - they also appear to speed up the rate at which cells age. The research showed that people who drank the equivalent of two cans of cola a day had DNA changes of cells 4.6 years older. Campaigners have blamed sugary drinks  for contributing to the rise in obesity and the number of people with type-2 diabetes, but this is the first piece to research to link soft drinks with premature ageing. Scientists analysed thousands of DNA samples to find that people who regularly reached for a fizzy drink had shorter telomeres, . These are tiny structures that protect DNA from damage and are an indicator of health. Found at the ends of chromosomes, they protect the DNA in them from damage, much like the caps on the ends of shoelaces prevent fraying. As we get older, our telomeres get shorter and shorter, leading to DNA becoming damaged and raising the odds of age-related illnesses such as Alzheimer's, diabetes and heart disease. Shorter than average telomeres are seen as a sign of ill health and premature death. Studying telomeres, the scientists found people who regularly drank sugar-sweetened fizzy drinks had ‘significantly' shorter telomeres than those who did not. Professor Elissa Epel, from the University of California at San Francisco, said: ‘Regular consumption of sugar-sweetened sodas might influence disease development, not only by straining the body's metabolic control of sugars, but also through accelerated cellular ageing of tissues. ‘This is the first demonstration that soda is associated with telomere shortness. ‘This finding held regardless of age, race, income and education level. 'Telomere shortening starts long before disease onset.’ While she only studied adults, Professor Epel warned  it is possible that drinking fizzy drinks is linked to telomere shortening in children, too. Scientists analysed thousands of DNA samples to find  people who regularly consumed fizzy drinks had shorter telomeres (illustrated). These are tiny structures that protect DNA from damage and are an indicator of health . However, she stressed  the study shows a link between soft drinks and ageing, but doesn't prove drinking fizzy drinks causes the ageing of cells. Working keeps you young, according to a study published last summer. The research linked unemployment with premature ageing. It is thought that the financial and emotional stress of being jobless makes its mark on the body's DNA. Men who had been out of work for at least two of the three years before their blood was taken were more than twice as likely to have short telomeres as those who had been in continuous employment. Researcher Jessica Buxton, of Imperial College London, said this suggests that the financial and emotional stress associated with being out of work was to blame. She said: 'Stressful life experiences in childhood and adulthood have previously been linked to accelerated telomere shortening.' In the study, the scientists measured telomeres in the white blood cells of 5,309 participants aged 20 to 65, with no history of diabetes or heart disease. They found  drinking two cans of cola a day – 20 fluid ounces – was linked to 4.6 years of ageing, based on telomere shortening and that one in five of the study’s participants fell into this category. Drinking a small soft drink daily, equivalent to eight fluid ounces, was associated with telomere shortening equivalent to 1.9 additional years of ageing. The effect on telomere length was similar to that of smoking, the researchers wrote in the American Journal of Public Health. Dr Cindy Leung, also of the university, said: ‘It is critical to understand both dietary factors that may shorten telomeres, as well as dietary factors that may lengthen telomeres. ‘Here it appeared that the only beverage consumption that had a measurable negative association with telomere length was consumption of sugared soda.’","Fizzy drinks appear to speed up the rate at which cells age .
People drinking two cans daily had DNA changes of cells 4.6 years older .
They measured telomeres -  caps found at the ends of chromosomes .
Shorter than average telomeres are seen as a sign of premature death .
This is the first study to link soft drinks to premature ageing ."
"When Jeannie Crutchfield learned that her 14-year-old daughter had ditched class, she decided to punish her in a way the girl would truly feel: by humiliating her on Facebook. With her cell phone recording, the angry mother turned up to her daughter Ricki's school in Casper, Wyoming last week to confront her about playing hooky and then following her to class. And once Ricki conceded that her mother was right, Crutchfield uploaded the video to Facebook - and Ricki and her siblings vowed never to defy their mother again. The video, which Crutchfield shared to her Facebook page, shows her approaching Ricki outside the school as she walks to class. Scroll down for video . Confrontation: Ricki Durrant, left, was stunned when her mother Jeannie Crutchfield, right, turned up at her school to tell her off about skipping school. Crutchfield uploaded a video of the confrontation to Facebook . 'When was I ditching, mom?' the teenager asks. 'Every day this week,' her mother responds. 'We're going to hold hands and we're going to go to class together. Isn't it great?' As Ricki refuses to respond to her and storms ahead to class, Crutchfield trails her. 'What's wrong?' she says. 'You don't want everyone to know why I'm here? You thought it was cute to dicth with your friends... Now let's see how cute you think is to hang out with mom during class.' Humiliating: Other students look on as Crutchfield follows her daughter through the school on the video . Accepting: Ricki eventually stops arguing with her mother and has been at every class since . Finally she corners the girl at a water fountain and Ricki insists she had only ever been out of class to see the nurse - which her mother says is not the truth. 'This is what happens when Ricki can't act right,' her mother said as the girl fell quiet. 'Her mom needs to come to the school and record her to get it through her head. I warned you didn't I?' After Crutchfield shared the video to Facebook, it has been viewed more than 32,000 times. But more importantly to the working single mom-of-three, her daughter's school attendance has been perfect, she told ABC News. 'As a single mom, I learned that I have to do double the work. I learned to improvise when it comes to my parenting,' she told ABC. Thankful: Ricki, pictured with her mother right, said she is grateful that her mother cares so much about her, while Crutchfield said that, as a single mother of three, sometimes she has to improvise . 'Her attitude has changed. She was asked [by a friend] if she wanted to ditch school yesterday, and she told the person no. The thought of mom following her again wasn’t appealing.' Even though some viewers called the treatment cruel, Ricki took it well. 'It just goes to show that my mom cares,' Ricki told KTWO. Crutchfield's other two children also found the video funny. 'As far as my youngest, she says she will never skip school ever,' Crutchfield said.","Jeannie Crutchfield learned that her daughter Ricki had skipped classes and went to her school in Casper, Wyoming to confront her .

"A charming video shows how one family's pet pygmy anteater makes sure an infant kangaroo stays off his turf. The clip shows the moment the anteater stands on two legs and spreads his like a scarecrow, sending the frightened joey hopping sharply away. It was filmed and uploaded by U.S.-based writer and conservationist Julia Heckathorn, who keeps the exotic animals to educate children. I am anteater, hear me roar: The pygmy anteater stands up on its hind legs in an intimidating pose . Mummy! This kangaroo joey knows its best to make a sharp exit when his anteater housemate comes by . The anteater's bizarre scarecrow pose is in fact the very same defensive position it would adopt if it felt threatened in the world. In their natural habitat of Central and South America, pygmy anteaters' main enemies are jaguars and pumas which hunt them in the grasslands, swampy areas, and forests where they live. When chased into a corner, the anteaters would rear up on their hind legs, roar loudly and slash desperately with the sharp claws on their front legs.

"A mysterious 'pyramid' has been spotted on the surface of a comet that scientists are hoping will unlock the secrets to how Earth formed. The strange structure was discovered by the Rosetta probe as it orbited comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko 297 million miles (478 million km) from Earth. At around 82ft-tall (25 metres), the structure is one of the larger boulders seen on the comet and could help scientists better understand its history. Scroll down for video . Boulder Cheops, taken by Rosetta’s OSIRIS camera on 19 September , from a distance of 17.7 miles (28.5km) The 'pyramid' stood out among a group of boulders on the lower side of 67P/C-G's larger lobe – an area that has reminded scientists of the famous pyramids at Giza near Cairo in Egypt. Esa has now named the structure Cheops, after the largest of those pyramids, the Great Pyramid, which was built as a tomb for the pharaoh Cheops around 2550 BC. Rosetta has spent 10 years chasing down comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and is now in orbit around the 'ice mountain', edging in closer to its surface each day. For a sense of scale, the comet is about three times the size of Ben Nevis and Rosetta is the size of a car with 105ft (32 metre) wings. The 'pyramid' stood out among a group of boulders on the lower side of 67P/C-G's larger lobe – an area that has reminded scientists of the famous pyramids at Giza near Cairo in Egypt . A patchwork of images of comet 67P from a distance of 10.5 miles (16.9km) from the centre of the comet . The Rosetta probe will launch its Philae robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles (10km) to Comet 67P. The 220lb (100kg) lander will reach the surface on 11 November. It will take around seven hours to descend. During the descent, images will be taken and other observations of the comet's environment will be made. Philae will make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace, using screws and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface. Once the lander touches down, it will make a 360° panoramic image of the landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has landed. The lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface, delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis. The interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards Rosetta. Cheops was seen for the first time in images obtained in early August upon Rosetta's arrival at the comet. But in the past few weeks, as Rosetta has navigated closer and closer to the comet, it imaged the unique structure again – but this time with a much higher resolution of 50 cm per pixel. The boulder-like structures that Rosetta has revealed in many places on the surface of 67P/C-G have been described as one of the comet's 'most striking and mysterious' features. Principal Investigator Holger Sierks, from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany, describes the surface of Cheops as 'very craggy and irregular.' Interspersed between the lighter lumps on the boulder's surface are intriguing small patches of darker material, similar in brightness and texture to the ground upon which the boulder lies. 'It almost looks as if loose dust covering the surface of the comet has settled in the boulder's cracks. But, of course, it is much too early to be sure,' says Dr Sierks. Apart from their size distribution, which is being measured through careful analysis of the images, almost all other properties of 67P/C-G's boulders are still a mystery to researchers. A close up of the surface of Cheops. The boulder-like structures that Rosetta has revealed in many places on the surface of 67P/C-G are one of the comet's most striking and mysterious features . Esa has now named the structure Cheops, after the largest of those pyramids, the Great Pyramid, which was built as a tomb for the pharaoh Cheops around 2550 BC . Rosetta took an incredible selfie of its 131ft (40 metre) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space last week. In the background is the duck-shaped comet, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with its distinct 'head' and 'body' clearly visible . As Rosetta continues to survey and monitor the comet's surface in the next months, the scientists will be looking for clues to better explain the formation of the comet. 'For example, if the boulders are exposed by cometary activity or are displaced following the comet's gravity field, we should be able to track this down in our images,' says Dr Sierks. Last month a 2.4 mile-wide (4km) region on the 'head' of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was revealed as the spot for the daring landing of Rosetta's Philae probe. The high-risk manoeuvre on November 11, if successful, will be the first time in history that a probe has been landed on a comet. Scientists at mission control in Germany hope the spider-like probe will send back data that could answer questions on the origin of Earth's water and perhaps even life. But they've warned that the landing should be seen as an 'exciting extra' on the Rosetta mission as the mission carries a 'high risk'. The reconstructed-colour image, taken about 10 days ago, indicates how dark the comet appears. On the average, the comet's surface reflects about four per cent of impinging visible light, making it as dark as coal .

"This South African daredevil duo showed off some serious stunts earlier this month. Thankfully, Leander, one of the country's leading base jumpers, and Sylvain, an experienced slackliner, were filmed by an onlooker - and willing participant - called James. After videographer James attempted the rope swing into a base jump trick, he decided to document Leander and Sylvain's impressive project. Scroll down for videos . Hold on! Professional base jumper Leander takes his position for a swing rope into base jump maneuver . Once he reaches the far side of the swing, Leander lets go and dispatches his parachute . 'They were very friendly and immediately told me that I had to do the swing as well, which I did,' James says. 'I can without a doubt say that it was the scariest thing I have ever done. 'I subsequently asked them if I could make a short movie of what they were doing for them and 'Let Go' is the result.' In the video, Leander explains just how much work goes into ensuring that a stunt of such stunning magnitude goes off without a hitch, before fastening the Go Pro camera to himself and plunging down toward the ocean below. Once safely on the ground, Leander flashes a peace sign to the Go Pro camera . An experienced rigger, Leander's fellow daredevil Sylvain also makes sure to take a turn on the swing rope . No fear here! Sylvain happily soars above the ocean, swinging back toward the cliffside . 'We did some test jumps to make sure it can hold on and everyone's held on, so it's all good. But the problem is, if you don't swing through the whole swing and let go at the bottom, you've above about 70 m of vertical, which is too low to base jump. 'You'd make it, but it would be very nasty. If you hold on all the way  to the end, you're like 150 m [above the ground], so that's safe. As long as you don't slip off, you're good.' After Leander demonstrates his skill, swinging out over the ocean, before parachuting the rest of the way down the cliffside, his friend Sylvain takes on a breathtaking slackline walk. Next up? Sylvain, a trained stunt professional and slackliner, will take a walk high in the sky . Though he shakes at times, Sylvain keeps calm and cool and maintains balance . While walking out over the ocean, Sylvain says that he keeps his eyes fixed on the horizon . Upon completing his tricky walk in the sky, Sylvain turns to his friends to proclaim: 'Project done!' Sylvain, a master rigger, does mostly stunt-orientated work for the movie industry, and also has a company that specialises in manufacturing climbing and slacklining gear. 'Generally, on a high line, you would walk toward a cliff face or slackline towards a tree,' Sylvain explains after completing his sky-high walk. 'But this, your fixed point is the horizon.' Although it took several days to set up and test the length and strength of the ropes and lines, both men told James that it was 'very unlikely that they would ever rig it back up again.'

"Prince Charles has ordered a mass cull of 'invading' grey squirrels on his estates . Prince Charles has ordered a mass cull of 'invading' grey squirrels on his estates to protect trees, endangered native birds and other wildlife. They have already been blamed for driving out Britain's native red squirrels but the Royal Forestry Society said the rodents have also learnt to strip the bark from native trees. The Prince of Wales, who is patron of the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, is privately described as 'detesting' greys, according to the Sunday Times. A spokesman  confirmed he had ordered 'the humane and lawful control of grey squirrels' on Duchy of Cornwall land and his other properties, including Birkhall in Scotland. He said: ""The red squirrel is a most cherished and iconic national species, and, as Patron of the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, The Prince of Wales keenly supports all efforts to conserve and promote their diminishing numbers. ""Where appropriate, this includes the humane and lawful control of grey squirrels as well as other measures to enhance the natural habitat of reds across the Duchy of Cornwall estate, in accordance with established estate management practices."" The rodents, now numbering two-and-a-half million, carry a pox virus that is deadly to reds, but they are also thought to be having a much wider impact. Andrew Woods from the Royal Forestry Society said: 'They have learnt to strip the bark from almost all our native broadleaf trees so that in many areas there are no longer any juvenile oaks. 'They reach the age of 10 to 15 years and then get attacked and die.'

'They reach the age of 10 to 15 years and then get attacked and die.' Grey squirrels threaten the government's pledge to increase woodland cover from 10 per cent to 12 per cent of England's land area by 2060. The Royal Forestry Society said grey squirrels have also learnt to strip the bark from native trees . Simon Lloyd, the RFS development director said: 'They see planting native trees such as oak as pointless because too many will fall prey to squirrels.' Lord Redesdale, a Liberal Democrat peer, exterminated 23,400 grey squirrels on his land in Northumberland. He said: 'My stroke of genius was to find a way of screwing a hazelnut to the pressure plate that actuates the trap.' There are 17 red squirrel strongholds in northern England with an estimated 140,000 red squirrels left in Britain, but there are thought to be more than 2.5 million greys, according to the Forestry Commission.

"Emergency inspections have been carried out at more private Islamic schools and a flagship Church of England state school in London amid fears of a new 'Trojan horse' plot. At least six schools examined after concerns about Islamic influences in curriculums were raised by the Department for Education, according to government sources. They include Al-Mizan primary and the London East Academy, private schools for Muslim boys run by the East London Mosque Trust. Scroll down for video . Inspectors have visited Al-Mizan primary school in Tower Hamlets, London, amid fears of a 'Trojan-horse' plot . The schools teach their pupils, who are predominantly from families of Bangladeshi origin, to memorise the Koran and charge fees of £3,000 a year. Both were rated as providing a 'good' quality of education and teaching during their last inspections in 2011 and 'outstanding' for students' spiritual, moral, social and cultural development. Ofsted teams also paid snap inspections to Jamiatual Ummah secondary and Sir John Cass and Red Coat Church of England Secondary School, a voluntary aided state school overseen by Tower Hamlets education authority. Two other schools inspected have not been named. Tower Hamlets said the inspection has not found any 'Trojan Horse-type issues' relating to the conduct of staff or governors at Sir John Cass and Red Coat Church of England Secondary School . Tower Hamlets said the inspection has not found any 'Trojan Horse-type issues relating to the conduct of staff or governors at Sir John Cass. A council spokesman said it was 'one of the best performing schools in the country, however, all schools can improve, and we look forward to supporting the school in implementing the recommendations of the Ofsted report when it is published'. He added: 'Local education authorities have no powers whatsoever over the educational conduct and performance of private schools. This remains the responsibility of Ofsted and other agencies. Ofsted teams also paid a snap inspection to Jamiatual Ummah secondary in recent weeks . 'Councils do have a safeguarding duty for all children within their boundaries, but this does not include the right to inspect and enter the premises of private educational establishments.' A government source told The Sunday Times: 'There were specific concerns about the curriculum being taught in some of the schools. Since these schools were being investigated, it was decided to look at six schools in the area.' Ofsted inspectors gave a clean bill of health to safeguarding arrangements for pupils at Marner Primary, a Tower Hamlets state school, after a visit in September. At the time, Tower Hamlets council strongly denied claims by a Whitehall source that the borough was 'expected to be the next Birmingham' with a 'Trojan Horse' problem of Islamic influence in schools. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the Ofsted chief, has made it clear that more inspections will be undertaken more frequently in the light of the scandal. It involved claims that several schools in Birmingham had been infiltrated by governors and teachers with a hard-line Islamic agenda. Sir Michael Wilshaw said the plot was 'planned and orchestrated' attempt to control school boards . The Trojan Horse plot first came to light earlier this year, when a letter emerged outlining an alleged a plot by Muslim hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools. The letter prompted Department for Education inspectors to go into Park View School in Birmingham along with its sister schools, Golden Hillock and Nansen. Whistleblowers at Park View claimed the school was in the hands of a group of extremists who had infiltrated its governing body. It is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and non-Muslim pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school. The letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted in to the school and several others in the area. Following inspections, Sir Michael Wilshaw told MPs in July that there had been a 'planned and orchestrated' plot to radicalise pupils in schools in the city. He told the Education Select Committee said: 'I spoke to eight or nine head teachers. They believed it was planned and orchestrated. 'They believed people got together and decided which schools to target. They believed there was a strategy to infiltrate governing bodies. 'They believed governing boards couldn't take place in the normal way. They believed all that was planned and orchestrated. This was all in Birmingham.' When asked by MPs if pupils had been radicalised in the schools, Sir Michael replied: 'We didn't see that. The issue of extremism was outside of our remit.' The Ofsted chief inspector told MPs: 'What we did see was the promotion of a culture, which if that promotion had continued would have exposed these children to extremism.'","Inspectors have visited six more schools amid concerns of Islamic influence .

"A VERY COURAGEOUS DECISION: THE INSIDE STORY OF YES MINISTER by Graham McCann (Aurum £20) Exhausted by all the horrors in the world, we begin instead possibly the most fascinating of all pub conversations: which is the greatest British sitcom there has ever been? You might argue for Porridge, or possibly Fawlty Towers. I’m willing to hear evidence on behalf of Dad’s Army, and Blackadder (second and third series). But, as in all such debates, each of us has already made up his mind before a word has been spoken. My vote, as always, goes to Yes Minister and Yes, Prime Minister. (Right to left) Paul Eddington, Nigel Hawthorne and Derek Fowlds in Yes Minister . It’s easy to forget just how different and ground-breaking Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn’s series was. In 1979, when the BBC commissioned it, the sitcom landscape was bleak. Terry And June ruled the airwaves. Are You Being Served? had bedded down and was in for the long-haul. If you wanted intelligent comedy, deftly written and skilfully acted, making jokes no one had made before, you might as well have looked out of the window, because there wasn’t anything like that. Paul Eddington’s Jim Hacker arrives at the Department of Administrative Affairs as its new minister, and something of an innocent . But, as the prolific comedy historian Graham McCann points out, there had been something of a tradition in British comedy of laughing at civil servants. On radio, The Men From The Ministry had worked this seam in the 1950s and 1960s, and I’m sure I’m not the only one to have fond memories of Richard Wattis and Eric Barker as harassed Department of Education officials in the original St Trinian’s films. What no one had done before was pit a civil servant and a politician against each other and use their battles to satirise the process of government. Derek Fowlds’ Bernard Woolley, principal private secretary, sits in the middle of most parliamentary affairs, acting as referee and chorus .

The dynamic between these three very different actors was perfect — but they were enjoying themselves as well: they had Jay and Lynn’s delicious scripts to work with. Jay and Lynn had met in the 1970s through the Video Arts company Jay ran with John Cleese, making videos for companies to show their workforces. Jay had the current affairs background (he worked on the BBC’s Tonight show in the early 1960s) and the establishment contacts. Lynn, a contemporary of the Pythons, had the comedy chops. Jay was tall and Right-wing, Lynn short and Left-wing. They got on famously. Their scripts benefited from remarkably thorough research, assisted by several well-placed moles at the heart of government. As Lynn told McCann: ‘We exaggerated a bit, sometimes, to enhance the comedy, but we told the truth . . . We found that when we invented things, they had usually happened, or happened subsequently. The dynamic between these three very different actors was perfect — but they were enjoying themselves as well because they had delicious scripts to work with . ‘Most gratifying and astonishing of all, our inventions of “Sir Humphrey” and “Yes, Minister” seem to have entered the language as shorthand for Civil Service obstruction and absurdity in government. No writer could hope for more.’ The story goes — and McCann confirms it — that Eddington thought the Sir Humphrey part was the better one, and wanted it for himself. Reasoning that Jim Hacker needed Eddington’s warmth and vulnerability, Jay and Lynn persuaded him that Hacker’s character would develop over time, while Sir Humphrey could never change; he had essentially emerged fully formed. But McCann puts to bed the notion that Eddington was jealous of Nigel Hawthorne’s success, even though the latter won four BAFTAs for best comedy performance to Eddington’s none. After all, what do awards committees know? “Sir Humphrey” and “Yes, Minister” seem to have entered the language as shorthand for Civil Service obstruction and absurdity in government . McCann talks about Eddington’s mastery of the character, ‘allowing [Hacker] to hide behind a carapace of authority but still showing, through those wide, spaniel-like eyes and that gaping mouth, the mounting panic that lurked inside. Eddington did not just show an idea entering into Hacker’s head: he also showed it bouncing about inside the skull.’ That seems, to me, a perfect description. Hawthorne, by contrast, ‘was as fascinating to watch for how he was doing something as he was for what he was doing.’ How he learned those long, tortuous Sir Humphrey speeches remains a mystery. After that, King Lear would be a doddle. My all-time favourite comes from the 1984 one-off episode Party Games, in which Sir Humphrey hears he is going to be made Cabinet Secretary. Nigel Hawthorne’s Sir Humphrey Appleby is Jim Hacker's permanent secretary, and runs rings around him from the start . Back in Hacker’s office, he breaks the news to the minister: ‘The relationship, which I might tentatively venture to aver has not been without some degree of reciprocal utility and perhaps even occasional gratification, is approaching a point of irreversible bifurcation, and, to be brief, is in the propinquity of its ultimate regrettable termination.’ Two things to note here. First, the ‘to be brief’ is a touch of genius all in itself. The other is that, as you’re watching this, you’re laughing not just because it’s brilliantly funny in itself, but because you’re looking forward to the expression of absolute befuddlement on Hacker’s face. Which is even funnier. I must have watched it 30 times. If a funnier hour’s TV has ever been made, I would be amazed. McCann has written books about Dad’s Army, Terry-Thomas, Fawlty Towers and Morecambe and Wise. He is also a lecturer on social and political theory at King’s College, Cambridge, so he knows both halves of this world. His book is exemplary, everything we could have wished for. As well as talking to everyone and doing the legwork, he offers a critical acuity rare to this sort of book. And his conclusions are powerful. Yes Minister and Yes, Prime Minister, he suggests, ‘did more to engage and educate the general public about politics, in 38 short episodes, than most of the so-called “serious” means of enlightenment had done since the age of the great reform acts’. Suddenly, voters could see how government and administrators interacted, how policies were developed and how decisions were made. But none of this would have happened if the show hadn’t also made us laugh . Suddenly, voters could see how government and administrators interacted, how responsibilities were divided and distributed, how policies were developed, how decisions were made and how successes and failures were defined, described and defended. But none of this would have happened if the show hadn’t also made us laugh. McCann doesn’t think Yes Minister changed politicians very much: they’re still talking in daft soundbites and refusing to answer questions in interviews. He suspects civil servants are much the same, too. What it did change, though, was us. We didn’t know before, but we do now, and as a result, we are much better briefed to fight back. It’s not the smallest of legacies.","Paul Eddington, Nigel Hawthorne and Derek Fowlds starred in Yes Minister .

"Earlier this month Nasa chief Charles Bolden said the first humans set to Mars in the 2030s should be brought back after they’ve completed their mission on the red planet. But in a talk this week former Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin disagreed - he says the first Martian explorers should be tasked with setting up a colony. For the cost of getting there, Dr Aldrin says it makes more sense to actually stay on Mars and only bring people back when the colony is settled. Scroll down for video . Buzz Aldrin (shown) says the first Mars crews should remain on the red planet. He says for the cost of going to Mars they should not come back at first. Instead they should set up a colony and people should only start returning when a colony of about 100 is settled . Dr Aldrin was speaking at MIT’s AeroAstro Centennial Symposium in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Wednesday. 'It [will] cost the world - and the US - billions and billions of dollars to put these people there, and you're going to bring them back?' Dr Aldrin said, reports space.com. Nasa has made no secret of its desire to land humans on Mars in the 2030s. But according to former Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, we should be looking to go back to the moon before making the giant leap to the red planet. He says we don't yet have the technology or capabilities to safely make the trip to the Mars and should instead aim to live on the moon for 'generations' before. ‘The next logical destination? It’s obviously the moon as its just three days away,' Hadfield told MailOnline this month. ‘If there’s a mistake we can turn around and come back. ‘There’s sort of a public appetite for going to Mars right now in a big hurry, but there’s no tech to make it safe enough and affordable.' ‘What are you going to do when you bring them back here that can possibly compare [to] the value that they would be if they stayed there and Mars wasn't empty? ‘And then, they helped to work with the next group and it builds up a cadre of people. ‘When we've got 100 - or whatever it is - then we start bringing people back.’ Dr Aldrin’s words will likely strike a chord with Nasa, who have been keen to distance themselves from ventures that intend to send people to Mars on one-way trips. One such venture is Mars One, an ambitious proposal to send a crew to Mars by 2025 with no prospect of bringing them back to Earth. The mission would see crews and supplies steadily sent over many years, setting up a colony on the red planet and televising the event to raise money. It has been widely condemned by critics, however, with many pointing out the Dutch company has none of the infrastructure required for such a mission, such as a suitable spacecraft or rockets. In addition, a recent study from MIT found that the Mars One plan was not feasible, and the first crewmember would die in 68 days owing to a lack of supplies. Mars One's mission to the red planet (artist's illustration shown) has been widely panned by experts, with many saying the Dutch company lacks the technology or skills to have any hope of landing people on Mars. The company wants to send people to Mars in the next decade . Should the first mission to Mars be a one-way trip or a return journey? Nasa is firmly in the camp of making it a return journey, with the agency already testing the Orion spacecraft (illustrated) that will ultimately bring the first Martian explorers back into Earth's atmosphere once they have returned from their mission . SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, meanwhile, has often said that he personally wants to ‘die on Mars - just not on impact.’ His quote has often been misconstrued, however - what he meant is that he wants to live out his days in a colony on Mars. Nasa, though, is adamant that its first mission to Mars will not be to set up a colony, but rather a scientific mission akin to the moon landings to land and return on the planet. ‘[Elon Musk] wants to die there,’ Nasa chief Charles Bolden said in a talk in London earlier this month. ‘He doesn’t talk about coming back. But he and I disagree on that. ‘If someone wants to come back, I want them to be able to come back.’ Some of Dr Aldrin’s fellow panellists also disagreed with the prospect of a one-way trip to Mars. ‘At the very least, I think that people need a fighting chance to return,’ said former astronaut Vance Brand, who flew on the Space Shuttle and also the first US-Soviet joint spaceflight in 1975. The MIT AeroAstro Centennial Symposium is continuing with a discussion by Elon Musk later today. Buzz Aldrin (right) is seen here with fellow Apollo 11 crewmembers Neil Armstrong (left) and Michael Collins.

"Suicide: Billy Slagle said he was taking his destiny into his own hands by killing himself on Death Row . An Ohio inmate who hanged himself just days before his execution wrote in a suicide note that he resented how Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro received a life sentence while he was given death. Billy Slagle, 44, hanged himself with a belt . and shoestring in his cell on death row . at Chillicothe Correctional Institution on August 4 - just three days before he was scheduled to die for stabbing his neighbor Mari Anne Pope to death during a robbery in 1987. His execution was scheduled despite a calls, surprisingly, from the prosecution not to execute him. His victim's family has also requested that he not be put to death. In his suicide note, he called his nearly three decades in prison torture and said he was taking his destiny into his own hands, according to the State Highway Patrol report. 'In this letter, Slagle . gives details of what to do with his body and his property, claims Ohio . had no mercy on him, talks about his charges, that he has to forfeit his . life but Ariel Castro avoids the death penalty,' the patrol's summary . of the suicide note said. It . continued: '... he states the death penalty is inconsistent and . arbitrary, and his final paragraph is an apology to his loved ones'. Slagle's final two phone calls, made the . evening before, appeared to be to family members and did not mention . suicide or the upcoming execution, the report said. Anger: In a suicide note, he expressed resentment that Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro, pictured, was only sentenced to life whereas he was given death. Castro also killed himself a month after Slagle . In an unusual move, Tim McGinty, the prosecutor, had pushed for Slagle to be spared, arguing that under current practice in Cuyahoga County the crime wouldn't have been prosecuted as a death penalty case. He added that life without parole was not an option when Slagle was tried. Pope's family had joined the request for clemency for Slagle. A friend of Pope, a woman whose two children were in Pope's house as she was killed, had opposed mercy for Slagle. Slagle also died not knowing his attorneys were planning a last-minute appeal based on newly discovered information that Slagle was never informed of a plea bargain offered at the time. In a further twist, Castro himself was found hanged in his cell a month after Slagle's suicide. A coroner has ruled Castro's death suicide, but a prisons report has suggested he might have died while trying to achieve a sexual thrill as he choked himself. Scene: Slagle hanged himself with his belt in his cell on death row at Chillicothe Correctional Institution . Slagle's attorneys said on Thursday they remain saddened by his death. 'His loss of hope is evident by what little information this report reflects of his suicide note,' federal public defenders Joe Wilhelm and Vicki Werneke said in an email. Two prison guards have been suspended while the state investigates allegations an electronic log documenting checks on Slagle the day he died was falsified. The patrol report said Slagle was last seen alive just after 4am, about an hour before he was discovered hanging in his cell.","Billy Slagle, 44, was found hanged in his death row cell on August 4 - just 3 days before he was to be put to death for stabbing his neighbor in 1987 .

"Four men charged in the fatal carjacking of a young lawyer outside an upscale New Jersey mall last year have pleaded not guilty to felony murder and other charges. The suspects entered their pleas Wednesday during brief hearings in state Superior Court in Essex County. Hanif Thompson, 30, of Irvington, and Newark residents Karif Ford, 32, Basim Henry, 33, and Kevin Roberts, 36, are accused in the December 15th carjacking and killing of Dustin Friedland outside The Mall at Short Hills. Plea: Karif Ford, 32, (left) and Basim Henry, 33, (right) pleaded not guilty in the car jacking and killing of a 30-year-old man . In court: Kevin Roberts, 36, (left) and Hanif Thompson, 30, (right) appeared in court in New Jersey . Authorities have said Friedland, a 30-year-old lawyer from Hoboken, was killed by a gunshot to his head while returning to his car in the mall parking garage with his wife, Jamie Schare Friedland. Two men approached him and his wife after an evening of Christmas shopping and demanded the keys to his 2012 silver Range Rover at gunpoint. The carjackers confronted the couple and Friedland was shot in the head, but his wife was unharmed. He died hours later at the Morristown Medical Center. Authorities have not said which defendant allegedly fired the fatal shots. Tragedy: Friedland and his wife Jamie, who married in 2011, had been looking forward to starting a family together in the near future . Terror: One of the attackers entered the vehicle and ordered Friedland's wife out of the car at gunpoint . Friedman's silver Range Rover was recovered in Newark the morning after the attack on December 15 . The assailants drove off in the couple's silver Range Rover, which was found the next morning in Newark, about 10 miles from Short Hills. Prosecutors have said the couple was targeted solely because of the make of their vehicle. Jamie Schare Friedland filed a wrongful death lawsuit earlier this year, seeking unspecified damages. The suit claims the mall owners reduced security to increase profits and first responders mishandled a call for help, allegations those parties deny. Millburn Police Chief Gregory Weber has said the ambulance actually arrived at the mall 18 minutes after the shooting, but the vehicle had trouble getting to the crime scene because it could not fit below a low ceiling at the entrance to the parking deck. Eventually, emergency crews wheeled a stretcher up the entrance ramp to the level of the parking deck where Friedland was shot, Weber said. Investigation: Police at the scene where Dustin Friedland was fatally shot in front of his wife as two men carjacked their Range Rover SUV in a parking garage . Grieving widow Jamie Schare Friedland buried her husband just days after he was fatally shot in front of her . At her husband's funeral three days after his shooting, his 27-year-old wife remembered Friedland as a man full of integrity and chivalry, who always insisted on carrying packages and heavy things for her. ‘Dustin was the most chivalrous person. He would run to make sure he opened for car door for me. There wasn’t a bag anyone ever carried that Dustin didn’t help with.’ ‘Dustin always did the right thing,’ she added. The last of six speakers during the service, Jamie told mourners that despite her loss, ‘I’m truly the luckiest person I know, and I still believe that because I married the best man in the entire world.’ ‘I was lucky enough to be with him in the time we had,’ she said. The couple, who married in 2011, had been hoping to start a family before the tragic incident. ‘There was not a better person, a better soul, in the entire world. He was my entire world and my happiness was the most important thing to him, always.’ ‘He was kind, generous, giving, smart, loving, loyal, just the best person you ever met,’ she added.","Hanif Thompson, 30, Karif Ford, 32, Basim Henry, 33, and Kevin Roberts, 36, 'shot Dustin Friedland last December and stole his Range Rover'

"Family Court Chief Justice Diana Bryant revealed that a surrogate mother gave birth to twins in India in 2012 but their Australian parents only took one home . The abandonment of another surrogate baby in Asia has sparked calls for a national inquiry into the practice. Family Court Chief Justice Diana Bryant says a surrogate mother gave birth to twins in India in 2012 but their Australian parents only took one home. The commissioning parents, who had gone through an agency, did not want to take both babies. 'They already had one sex and they didn't want the other child. I don't know whether it was a boy or a girl,' Chief Justice Bryant told the ABC. Consular staff at Australia's High Commission in New Delhi delayed giving the Australian parents a visa while they tried to convince them to take both children home, she said. 'In the meantime, they were getting pressure from Australia to grant the visa,' she said. The ABC says sources have told them there was concern a senior federal politician had been advocating on behalf of the Australian parents. However, Chief Justice Bryant says she does not know where the pressure came from. 'There definitely was some pressure being placed to expedite the process to ensure they could return to Australia. That's what I have been told,' she said. The abandoned child was passed to another family, however Chief Justice Bryant said there were concerns over the fact that 'money had changed hands', saying: 'that's basically trafficking children' Consular officials told her the abandoned child was passed to another family. 'But they expressed to me their great concern that in fact money had changed hands,' she said. 'If that's true, that's basically trafficking children.'

"The education watchdog was yesterday accused of risking children’s safety by ditching plans for routine snap inspections of schools. Sir Michael Wilshaw provoked fury among supporters of former Education Secretary Michael Gove after rejecting demands for Ofsted to stop giving schools notice of visits by its inspectors. This is the second occasion on which current Education Secretary Nicky Morgan’s administration appears to have backtracked on a policy of her predecessor. Sir Michael Wilshaw has been criticised by supporters of Michael Gove for abandoning no-notice inspections . Mr Gove and David Cameron publicly backed a move to unannounced visits for all schools following the ‘Trojan Horse’ revelations that Islamic extremists had tried to infiltrate governing bodies at a string of Birmingham schools. Some schools were said to have put on ‘hastily arranged shows of cultural inclusivity’ such as lessons on Christianity after receiving notice that inspectors were poised to visit. But Sir Michael, the chief inspector, insisted yesterday he did ‘not need’ to introduce routine no-notice inspections for all schools but that they would still be conducted in specific schools if Ofsted received reports of declining standards. Now Dominic Cummings, a former special adviser to Mr Gove, has accused Sir Michael of bowing to pressure from teaching unions which had bitterly resisted the move to routine snap inspections. ‘It’s bad news for parents that Ofsted and the Government have caved in to the unions,’ he told the Mail. ‘There are big problems with schools cheating inspections to hide bad behaviour and bad teaching. In other fields involving safety, it is basic that inspections should be no notice so that transparency catches mistakes. ‘Now, schools that get the best marks are often the ones who put on the best show – not ones that teach best. This surrender will mean lower standards and puts children at risk.’ Education secretary Nicky Morgan, left, has abandoned two of her predecessor Michael Gove's policies, right . The revelation that most schools will continue to receive notice of Ofsted visits came as part of a wider shake-up of the inspection system in England. Schools now face inspections every three years instead of every five as at present, even though, Sir Michael admitted, school performance can decline ‘very quickly’ in a matter of months. Sir Michael said he had considered calls for routine no-notice inspections, but ‘after much thought and deliberation’ had decided against them. Heads are currently told of an impending inspection about half a day in advance. Sir Michael insisted that one of the key criteria for triggering a no-notice inspection was concerns over safeguarding children. The chief inspector said 40 had already been mounted this term at schools where Ofsted had concerns over standards, and there were plans for more where ‘regional intelligence’ suggested that schools were failing to protect pupils from extremism. Denying that he was bowing to pressure from teaching unions, Sir Michael said: ‘I’m not caving in, because we are increasing the number of unannounced inspections. Is it something we might want to consider in the future? We will have a look at it.’ Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘It is good news that Ofsted has decided against a move to routine no-notice inspections.’ Since taking over as Education Secretary in July, Mrs Morgan has reversed Mr Gove’s plans to make misbehaving children go for a run as a form of punishment, and in stark contrast to Mr Gove’s bullish stance towards the teaching unions – which he termed ‘the blob’ – she has vowed to do ‘everything I can’ to reduce teachers’ workload.","Ofsted accused of risking child safety by abandoning snap inspections .

"Angela Merkel has warned European nations they must respect national deficit targets after France backed off promises to reduce overspending. Speaking in Berlin today, the German Chancellor said eurozone nations must commit to stability, adding that Europe's economy is 'still too fragile' for nations to fall back into heavy borrowing. Her comments come as a clear warning to socialist France, whose deficit actually rose in 2014, and whose budget for 2015 shreds promises to reduce the deficit below three per cent within two years. Anger: In a clear warning to France's socialist president Francois Hollande (pictured left in Berlin today), German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) said European nations must respect national deficit targets . The EU executive will decide over the coming weeks whether to force member countries to revise their budgets, and France risks an embarrassing 'fail' from Brussels. Patience among other EU countries that had to make budget cuts of their own is also wearing thin. Without naming France, Merkel noted in a speech to Parliament that EU leaders in June recommitted themselves to the EU's budget rules, known as the stability and growth pact. 'All, and I stress again all, member states must respect in full the rules of the strengthened stability and growth pact,' she said. 'These rules must be applied credibly to all member states - only then can the pact fulfill its function as a central anchor for stability and above all for confidence in the eurozone.' Europe's economic recovery 'is still too fragile for us simply to go back to business as usual,' she added. Address: German Chancellor Angela Merkel speaks in the lower house of Germany's parliament in Berlin today . A string of disappointing economic data from Germany, the eurozone's biggest economy, has deepened concerns over prospects for the 18-nation currency area's recovery. The eurozone economy failed to grow in the second quarter, dragged down by a 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter contraction in Germany. Despite calls from abroad for Berlin to pump money into the economy, Merkel is determined to stick to plans to get by without new borrowing next year. That, along with a pledge not to raise taxes, was a central feature of her election campaign last year. 'I think we can show in Germany that growth and investment can be strengthened without having to leave the (budget) consolidation course,' she said. 'It is business and companies that create jobs and innovation - so, if we want growth in Europe, this must above all be about mobilizing private capital.' Next Monday, the finance and economy ministers of Germany and France are to meet in Berlin to discuss ways of encouraging investment.","German chancellor warns EU nations they must respect deficit targets .

"Many of the current security procedures in place by banks are good, but they're not foolproof - anyone could theoretically access your account if they had your debit card, password and so on. But mimicking someone's voice is much more difficult, and it's for that reason many banks are now turning in that direction to provide added security. Known as voice biometrics, the technology means that only your voice can access your bank on the phone - and it's something that could soon make its way to the general public. An investigation found that banks are quietly rolling out voiceprinting. The biggest roll-out is in Turkey, while the US and UK are following suit. In this photo Benoit Fauve, a speech scientist with a voice recognition technology company ValidSoft, points to a screen displaying the voice biometric features of a telephone call . In an investigation by Raphael Satter for the Associated Press, it was revealed that businesses and even governments are increasingly turning to voiceprints. This is apparently being used by some when people pay pensions, collect taxes, track criminals, replace passwords and more. But the technology is not being well-communicated to customers, with the roll-out seemingly taking place behind closed doors. Vendors say the timbre of a person's voice is unique in a way similar to the patterns at the tips of someone's fingers. The shape of your vocal cavities and the way you move your mouth makes your voice unique - more so even than a fingerprint. A voiceprint system uses something known as a spectrogram to veryify the identity of your voice. By speaking a given phrase, a person's voice is mapped on a spectrogram. This measures the pitch of their voice with the time taken to speak. Different voices create different spectrograms, so a person's voice can be matched with a previously spoken phrase. Many modern systems can separate someone's voice from background noise, so being in a busy environment won't make identification impossible. And even if the speaker is ill or tired so their speech sounds different, most systems can still identify their voice and verify it with that stored in the database. Voiceprint technology measures the characteristics of a person's speech. Typical speaker recognition software compares those characteristics with data held on a server. If two voiceprints are similar enough, the system declares them a match. 'There's a misconception that the technology we have today is only in the domain of the intelligence services, or the domain of ""Star Trek,""' said Paul Burmester, of London-based ValidSoft, a voice biometric vendor. 'The technology is here today, well-proven and commonly available.' Dan Miller, an analyst with Opus Research in San Francisco, estimates that the industry's revenue will roughly double from just under £250 million ($400 million) last year to up to £560 million ($900 million) next year. Barclays PLC recently experimented with voiceprinting as an identification for its wealthiest clients. It was so successful that Barclays is rolling it out to the rest of its 12 million retail banking customers. 'The general feeling is that voice biometrics will be the de facto standard in the next two or three years,' said Iain Hanlon, a Barclays executive. An Associated Press investigation has found that two of America's biggest retail banks, Chase and Wells Fargo, are quietly taking some callers' voiceprints to fight fraud. Vendors say the timbre of a person's voice is unique in a way similar to the patterns at the tips of someone's fingers . The Vanguard Group Inc, a Pennsylvania-based mutual fund manager, is among the technology's many financial users. Tens of thousands of customers log in to their accounts by speaking the phrase: 'At Vanguard, my voice is my password' into the phone. 'We've done a lot of testing, and looked at siblings, even twins,' said executive John Buhl, whose voice was a bit hoarse during a telephone interview. 'Even people with colds, like I have today, we looked at that.' The single largest implementation identified by the AP is in Turkey, where mobile phone company Turkcell has taken the voice biometric data of some 10 million customers using technology provided by market leader Nuance Communications Inc. However many others are rolling out their own versions. Some speech recognition technology is already noticeable in modern society, such as Apple's Siri (stock image shown). However, speech recognition may become more ubiquitous as banks and companies prefer it to other mans of identification like a password . In the US, law enforcement officials use the technology to monitor inmates and track offenders who have been paroled. In New Zealand, the Internal Revenue Department celebrated its 1 millionth voiceprint, leading the revenue minister to boast that his country had 'the highest level of voice biometric enrollments per capita in the world.' In South Africa, roughly 7 million voiceprints have been collected by the country's Social Security Agency, in part to verify that those claiming pensions are still alive. Some activists worry that the popularity of voiceprinting has a downside, though. 'It's more mass surveillance,' said Sadhbh McCarthy, an Irish privacy researcher. 'The next thing you know, that will be given to border guards, and you'll need to speak into a microphone when you get back from vacation.' However it seems that for now voiceprinting will become ever more ubiquitous in the coming years.","Investigation found that banks are quietly rolling out voiceprinting .

"Josie Cunningham said she will sell her breast milk to new mothers and men with 'milk fetishes' Last week she sparked fury among mothers after saying breastfeeding was 'vile and borderline incest'. And now unemployed NHS scrounger Josie Cunnignham has revealed she will sell her breast milk in her latest cash-grabbing venture. The unemployed mother-of-three, who made headlines after smugly revealing she had received a £4,800 breast enlargement from the NHS, welcomed a daughter last month after flirting with the idea of selling tickets to her child's birth. When questioned by followers on Twitter last week whether or not she was breastfeeding baby Grace Nieve, the 24-year-old from Leeds said she found the act 'vile and borderline incest'. In a bid to make money, the would-be glamour model has now revealed she will sell her breast milk to new mothers and men with 'milk fetishes' instead. Defending her decision, she told the Sun: 'My breasts are for my partner, not my child.' Despite smoking and drinking throughout her pregnancy, she said she wanted to sell milk to new mothers for £2 an ounce - and £10 an ounce to men with 'milk fetishes'. 'I should be able to produce around 30ozs a day, that's up £300 a day or £2100 a week,' she added. Miss Cunningham's controversial pregnancy saw her offering tickets to strangers to watch her give birth, and announcing that she would quit smoking and drinking alcohol when she learned she was having a girl. Before going into labour, she revealed she had been 'fooled' into thinking the father was a Premier League footballer. Writing a lengthy post on Facebook, she said: 'I feel so dirty, ashamed and devastated. I've been completely manipulated by a man for 18 months pretending to be a Premiership footballer. 'I feel physically fooled by him and had sex with someone who claimed to be someone he wasn't. Would-be glamour model Josie Cunningham, 24, seen leaving hospital with her new baby daughter Grace earlier this month, left, said last week that she wasn't breastfeeding her because it was 'vile and borderline incest' 'I let a conman put his hands on me, kiss me with his lips and fill my head with lies.' The footballer she claimed to have been in a relationship with however lives with his girlfriend and, to the best of knowledge, has had no contact with Miss Cunningham. Her latest comment about breastfeeding sparked outrage among mothers who slammed her view as 'disgusting' and 'uneducated'. When asked whether she would breastfeed her daughter like new mother Kimberly Walsh, she wrote: 'No I'm not! I think the idea is vile and borderline incest!' 'People saying it's natural.... Maybe it was before powdered milk - in the same way it was 'natural' to walk around naked before clothes' And she concluded: 'But you would soon kick off if I started walking around naked. It's time to change.'","Josie Cunningham plans to sell breast milk for £2 an ounce to new mothers .

"A 11-year-old girl has missed four weeks of lessons after the school she had been offered a place at turned into a boys-only establishment without informing her mother. Maddison Selwood, of Birmingham, was set to start at Hunters Hill Technology College this September, according to her mother, Cheryl Broadway. But when the 40-year-old rang to inquire about term starting dates and school uniforms she was shocked to discover that the college would only be accepting boys. Maddison Selwood, pictured above with her mother, Cheryl Broadway, was supposed to be starting at a new school this September - only to discover that the college had become a boys-only establishment . Mrs Broadway said special needs pupil Maddison, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and needs one-to-one teaching, was initially offered a place  back in April. But by June the mother-of-four had not been contacted by the school. She said: 'I hadn't been told about induction days or what school uniform to buy, which I thought was really odd. 'So I called the school and they told me Maddison could no longer have a place there because it was about to be turned into a school for boys. The 11-year-old had been offered a place at Hunters Hill Technology College in April, according to her mother . 'I was absolutely furious that nobody had thought to tell us and we had no idea where Maddison would be going to school.' Maddison has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and requires one-to-one teaching . She said the 11-year-old was then offered a place at Spring Hill High School, in Erdington, in July - but could not start the new term this month as Birmingham City Council had failed to give the placement the rubber stamp of approval. Maddison is now due to start the school on Monday after weeks of wasting time at home. But the council's Special Educational Needs Assessment and Review Service has still not agreed to fund the transport to get her to and from the Erdington school. Mrs Broadway added: 'I am absolutely disgusted about this whole situation. 'The council has made one blunder after another and it is inexcusable that Maddison has missed virtually a month of school. 'Her condition means that she doesn't cope well with change and this has all been a lot of upheaval and uncertainty for her.' A council spokesman said work was being done in a bid to ensure Maddison can start school on Monday. 'Maddison was originally allocated a place at Hunters Hill, in line with parental preference,' he said. 'However, following a change in circumstance, we have found an alternative placement in consultation with parent wishes. 'Maddison is due to start her school place next week. We are currently working to resolve any issues relating to transport as quickly as possible.'","Maddison Selwood set to start Hunters Hill Technology College this term .

"When Chris Leadbetter took a photo of his grandfather in hospital, he hoped it would be an image he could treasure after the pensioner was told his bladder cancer was terminal. However when Mr Leadbetter examined the picture he noticed there was a chilling figure of a woman behind his grandfather, Bob Large. Stunned, he showed staff at the Countess of Chester Hospital the photograph who went on to describe the 'long haired blonde girl', who they claim, a lot of patients see lurking at the end of their beds. And the ghostly figure may have had an impact of Mr Large as he has since been released from hospital and sleeping better than before, despite the previous diagnosis. Scroll down for video . Chris Leadbetter noticed the  image of a woman, in a veil, behind his grandfather after he went to visit him in the Royal Countess of Chester Hospital where he was being treated for terminal cancer, and took a photo . Mr Leadbetter had gone to visit his grandfather at the hospital in Chester, which is on the site of the former County Lunatic Asylum, built in 1829. The pensioner had been told his bladder cancer and kidney failure was terminal. Mr Leadbetter arrived to find the local vicar at his grandfather's bedside, praying for his recovery, and decided to take the 'last' picture on his mobile phone. But it was not until he got home a week later and examined it that he saw a spectre-like figure of a woman, dressed in a veil, lurking in the back of the picture. The 20-year-old said: 'When I saw it the hairs just stood up on me. I was so freaked out. I saw the picture late at night so I went and woke the rest of my family up straight away. 'Everyone in the family was shocked. They couldn't believe it. The Countess of Chester Hospital was built on the site of the County Lunatic Asylum, which stood there in 1829 . 'My granddad is still alive now and has actually been released from hospital, despite what the doctors said. 'He finds the picture quite comforting. He thinks that someone is looking over him.' When he asked the manager of Ward 44, where his grandfather was a patient, about the image she said: 'Oh, her. Lots of patients see her at the end of their beds'. The manager, unprompted, then went on to describe the 'long haired blonde girl in a white gown'. He added: 'I took the picture the day before I went on holiday because we were told to expect the worst. The Cheshire County Lunatic Asylum opened in September 1829 on the site, under the 1808 County Asylum Act. It initially had 90 beds, with people sleeping on straw mats, according to the History of Upton-by-Chester website. The front section of the building included the kitchens, brewhouse, storehouse and laundry. However demand for beds rose as mental health care improved and by 1900 there was room for 900 patients at the site, and further building work took place. The site was turned into a fully functioning hospital in 1968 when other facilities were built there, alongside the mental health unit. It was known as West Cheshire Hospital. In 1984 the hospital was re-named the Countess of Chester Hospital, in honour of Princess Diana who reopened it. The Countess of Chester had been one of her titles. The City Hospital and Royal Infirmary sites, that were part of the foundation trust in Chester have since closed and all services are delivered at the Countess of Chester building. Chester lunatic asylum was built in 1829 . 'I didn't notice anything until about a week ago when I needed to go through my phone and delete some pictures. 'The strange thing is there is nothing between my granddad, who is sat on the corner of the bed, and the women in the picture - no glass, or windows or anything. 'A few people suggested it looked like a reflection but there is literally nothing for it to reflect off. ' Mr Leadbetter added: 'My gran told the ward manager she needed to speak to him about something and the second she said she had a picture of a ghost he described it perfectly. 'He says it'd not the first time the ghost had been seen. One patient was screaming in the night because it was at the end of her bed.' Mr Large said: 'The picture is of my guardian angel. I've been in that hospital, on the same ward so many times. 'The vicar always comes in and says prayers and then goes and I always feel much better. Every time I feel like there is a presence in the room. 'I've just got a feeling that whoever it is, is watching over me. This is the first time I've actually seen her but I've had the feeling she's been there a while. 'It's the strangest thing. I can't explain it. I'll be lying there feeling very ill. Then I'll get the feeling of the presence. Then I'll suddenly feel much better and I can sit up. 'The face looks very familiar to me, but I don't think it's anyone I know. I think I just recognise the presence. 'Gosh, how he caught it on camera I don't know. I can't understand it. It's amazing. 'She'll continue to watch over me - I'm sure of it.' Mr Large's wife Shelia, said: 'The picture is the talk of the town. Bob is telling everyone. 'After that picture was taken he slept for the whole night. The best he has slept in a long time. He thinks it was because of the angel. 'He's telling all the nurses and doctors who come to visit him that someone is looking out for him.'","Chris Leadbetter went to visit grandfather Bob Large in hospital in Chester .

"Travelling on a city's underground system is never expected to be an exciting experience - rather a convenient way of getting from A to B. But this could not be farther from the truth in the Swedish capital Stockholm, where artists have transformed the city's subway into a gigantic, kaleidoscopic art exhibition. Around 90 of the city's 100 subway stations have been given a dazzling makeover by over 150 artists, who have been let loose over the last 55 years. The results are spellbinding, transforming the subterranean transport system into a world of colour and visual stimulation, rather than somewhere to rest amongst the rats while waiting for your train to come. The makeover has also helped to make the subway system - widely regarded as the most beautiful in Europe - into the world's longest art exhibition, measuring 110 kilometres (68.3 miles). This series of breathtaking photographs captures the artistic beauty of the subway. Walking under a rainbow: People pass below one of the huge art pieces in Stockholm's subway . Underground art: The subway system in Stockholm is widely regarded as the longest art exhibition in the world, measuring 110 kilometres . The system features a range of different artistic styles drawn from the art scene in Sweden's largest city over the last 55 years. The first underground works in the Metro were kick-started by pioneering artists Vera Nilsson and Siri Derkert. Stockholm's first underground line opened in 1950 but the first art installation did not appear until 1957. Two motions on art in the subway were . submitted to Stockholm City Council in 1955, attracting cross-party approval and . allowing almost 60 years of work to begin. And it's not just static . painting and sculpture on offer at the subways - art films have been . shown at Skanstull metro station since 2004. Blood red: A landscape is painted below a red sky. Art installations in Stockholm's subway first started to appear in the 1950s and have been added to since . Into the fiery pits: The red paint on this station's bare rock walls creates an invigorating mood underground . Bus and train stations are also . decorated, although the city's transport operator SL says that the art . has 'heavy demands' place on it, as it must be 'washable, durable, . weather proof and sometimes even have a functional role'. And the benefits are not just to make . the daily commute a little more pleasant; the company believes it also . helps travellers find their way - and reduces crime. The SL  website states: 'The art . makes the stations perceived as more beautiful, safer and it helps to . make the trip into something more than just a transport between two . places.

It featured an alluring blonde with bright red lipstick, provoking fierce dispute over whether it was the right way to recruit women into the Army's dowdy Auxiliary Territorial Service. It was so contentious that Conservative MP Thelma Cazalet condemned it in Parliament. Because very few copies of it were made, it is among the most rare WWII posters to collect - and this one was sold for £1,200. The collection also features work by well-known artists like Kenneth Cyril Bird and Frank Wootton as well as posters by unknown designers.

It was sold by the family of Ernest Bendell-Bayly, a commercial artist who ran a design studio in London's Fleet Street producing posters for the war effort. Mr Bendell-Bayly was a partner of the Bayly-Souster Group and kept copies of many of the posters the studio produced, whether they made it into circulation or not. The posters were sold in 91 separate lots at Penzance Auction House in Cornwall. Experts had tipped the archive to fetch £10,000 but the final total was £18,995. Mimi Connell-Lay, from the auction house, said: 'These WWII recruiting posters belonged to Ernest Bendell-Bayly, owner of a London design studio that made the posters.

'Very few have survived so it is very rare, and the sale price reflects that. 'We can't find any evidence of the the Hitler, Goebbels and Goering designs ever being printed. 'It may be that they were too obscure and that at a time before television the British public didn't know what Goerring and Goebbels looked like. 'Perhaps the message was a bit too ambiguous, or perhaps they thought people might take an instruction to 'Take time off! too literally. 'On many levels the posters act as historical documents.

"It gives an unprecedented glimpse into the body, and could revolutionise medicine. A new 3D microscope can image cells in the body, watching as cancer spreads or an embryo develops, for instance. The technique, called lattice light-sheet microscopy, generates extraordinarily sharp, 3-D images and videos of live organisms at scales ranging from single molecules to early-stage embryos. Scroll down for videos . This animation reveals a model for what happens in metastasis, showing cancer cells (green) crawling through a primary tumor (orange spider web). Light sheet microscopy involves illuminating the specimen from the side, sweeping a thin pencil of light, termed a Bessel beam, across the imaging field. The images from that section are recorded, the specimen is moved a tiny fraction and the process repeated. The 2D sections can then be integrated into a 3D image. The process is fast enough to record dynamic events within the sample. To reduce the time taken to scan a section, Betzig had the idea of dividing the beam into seven parallel parts. Over the last decade, powerful new microscopes have dramatically sharpened biologists' focus on the molecules that animate and propel life. The imaging platform developed by Eric Betzig, who just weeks ago won a Nobel prize, and colleagues at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Research Campus offers another leap forward for light microscopy. Light sheet microscopy involves illuminating the specimen from the side, sweeping a thin pencil of light, termed a Bessel beam, across the imaging field. The images from that section are recorded, the specimen is moved a tiny fraction and the process repeated. The 2D sections can then be integrated into a 3D image. The process is fast enough to record dynamic events within the sample. To reduce the time taken to scan a section, Betzig had the idea of dividing the beam into seven parallel parts. The techniques have improved biologists' ability to visually track the movements of cells' tiniest structures – but there were always trade-offs. Imaging cells at high resolution in three dimensions usually meant sacrificing imaging speed, as well as subjecting cells to significant light-induced toxicity. 'What happens is you end up designing the questions you ask around the tools that are available,' Legant says. Infections in the body: T cell expressing a plasmid (orange) approaching a target cell expressing a plasma membrane marker fused to tagRFP (blue), as seen from the side (top) and from the viewpoint of the . APC (bottom). 'With the lattice light sheet, the Betzig team can now optimize their imaging technology for the questions that biologists want to answer. The new microscope evolved from one Betzig unveiled in 2011. To apply a super-resolution structured illumination technique developed at Janelia by the late Mats Gustafsson, Betzig's team moved the Bessel beam to produce a lattice-like pattern of light. 'With that we not only get rid of the side lobe stuff, we actually push the resolution a bit beyond the diffraction limit,' he says. To reduce the time required to move the Bessel beam each time a sample was imaged, the developers split the beam into seven parallel parts, so each traveled just one-seventh of the original distance. Suddenly, the cells they were imaging seemed healthier. 'What was shocking to us was that by spreading the energy out across seven beams instead of one, the phototoxicity went way down,' Betzig says. 'What I learned from that experience is that while the total dose of light you put on the cell is important, what's far more important is the instantaneous power that you put on the cell.' Volume renderings at eight consecutive time points of a single specimen of the protozoan T. thermophila taken from a 4D data set spanning 1250 time points. The new microscope operates in two modes. One uses the principles of structured illumination to create very high-resolution images. In this case, the final image is created by collecting and processing multiple images of every plane of the sample. Imaging can be sped up to capture faster processes, albeit at lower resolution, with an alternative 'dithered' mode. Light exposure, and thus damage to cells, is lower in the dithered mode; in many cases, tagged proteins are naturally replaced by cells before their signal fades appreciably. 'So there are many cells you could look at forever in 3D,' Betzig says. Thirty teams of biologists have come to Janelia over the past year to find out what the lattice light sheet microscope can reveal about the systems they study. Chen, Legant, and Wang have worked with the researchers to optimize the technology for a variety of experiments. Cells in prophase (left) and anaphase (right),  The graph shows the distribution of growth rates at . different stages of mitosis, averaged across nine to twelve cells. The microscope is also fast enough to track the rapid growth and retraction of cytoskeletal components in dividing cells, and gentle enough to monitor the molecular dynamics of developmental processes that unfold over many hours. 'We know what the microscope can offer in terms of the imaging, but I think there are a lot of applications we haven't even thought of yet,' Legant says. Betzig wants the lattice light sheet to be widely used, even as technology development continues in his own lab. His team has built a second microscope for Janelia's Advanced Imaging Center, where it will be available to visiting scientists free of charge, and deployed two more of the microscopes to labs at Harvard and the University of California, San Francisco. In fact, Betzig's team freely shares its designs, providing detailed instructions to scientists with the expertise to build their own version of the instrument. Zeiss has licensed the Bessel beam and lattice light sheet microscopy. 'It takes a huge amount of effort to move from a successful high-tech prototype to broader adoption of an imaging technology,' Betzig says. 'Ultimately, commercialization is the crucial last step to ensuring that these technologies can have broad impact in the research community.'","Called lattice light-sheet microscopy, technique generates  3-D images and videos .

"A large wave capsized a fishing boat off the coast of Northern California Saturday, leaving four of the five people aboard dead, authorities said. None of those aboard was  wearing the life vests that were aboard the craft when they went into the 59-degree water, said Sgt. Cecile Focha of the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department. One man survived by swimming to the shores of a rocky islet, where he was rescued by a helicopter crew. 'It's such a tragedy, such a loss,' Focha said. Four people on a crabbing boat died Saturday off the coast of Northern California, when a wave capsized their vessel, sending a total of five people into the rough and cold water . Only one managed to survive by swimming to shore and some nearby rocks, officials said Saturday. None of the passengers wore a life vest, which Sgt. Cecile Focha said were available on the boat . The lone survivor, Phillip Sanchez, 66, of Bodega Bay, told rescuers they were returning in the privately owned 32-foot boat, named The Frog, on the opening day of crabbing season . The vessel was part of a flotilla celebrating the start of the annual commercial and recreational crab fishing season, usually held on the first Saturday of November . A mariner reported the overturned boat near Bodega Bay, about 70 miles north of San Francisco, about 10 a.m. The lone survivor, Phillip Sanchez, 66, of Bodega Bay, told rescuers that they were returning in the privately owned 32-foot boat on the opening day of crabbing season. Sanchez said he managed to swim through the 9-foot swells to Bodega Rock. Using a 100-foot line, a Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office helicopter pulled Sanchez to safety. Wearing a T-shirt and jeans, Sanchez sustained minor scrapes from the rocks and was very cold from the 59-degree water, Focha said. A Coast Guard boat retrieved the bodies of the four victims, three men and one woman. Three of the victims were identified late Saturday as Jessie Daniel Langley, 79, Samuel Garcia, 86, and David Costa, 60. Langley and Garcia were described as colorful residents of Bodega Bay's tight-knit fishing community. 'It's just horrifying,' Kelly Martin, manager of a local grocery store, told the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat. 'We called Jessie Uncle Jessie. That's how well we knew him. He was old-school hillbilly. Sam was the cranky crab guy. Everybody loved Sammy.' A mariner reported the overturned boat near Bodega Bay, about 70 miles north of San Francisco . The Coast Guard dispatched a crew that was training nearby when another local mariner reported a boat had capsized. Four people were pulled from the water, but they were unconscious and unresponsive . The lone surivivor, Philip Sanchez says he managed to swim through the 9-foot swells and cling to sharp rocks until a California Highway Patrol helicopter rescued him. Using a 100-foot line the copter pulled him to safety . The boat ended up washed against the shoreline, floating upside down . 'This is not protected water,' U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Aaron Bretz said. 'The water temperature is very cold. This is where you need to have your life jacket on, and you need to understand what kind of weather you're getting into and be extremely careful.' The accident remains under investigation, he said.

"Women are half as likely as men to be in a job paying more than £50,000 a year, new figures show. One in 15 female full-time workers earns over £50,000 a year, compared to one in seven men, according to figures that show a widening gender pay gap. A separate survey claims the pay gap is such that women effectively work for free for 57 days a year. Women are half as likely as men to be in a job with an annual salary of more than £50,000, according to new figures (file picture) To mark Equal Pay Day today, The Trades Union Congress (TUC) released new analysis of data from the Office for National Statistics. It showed full-time female workers earn on average £28,000, compared to £33,000 for men, a difference of £5,000, or 16 per cent. This gap is even greater in some jobs, widening to 27 per cent in the financial sector and 26 per cent for sales jobs – meaning women routinely earn just three-quarters of men’s wages. Women working full-time as senior education professionals earn £13,000, or 22 per cent less, while full-time female solicitors earn £10,000, or 20 per cent, less. The TUC said it showed that the glass ceiling was ‘stronger than ever’. They said thousands of women were still being paid less money for the same job or being passed over for promotion. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Four decades on from the Equal Pay Act women are still losing out on pay and career opportunities. ‘It feels like the glass ceiling is getting stronger not weaker and we need a much tougher approach to stop future generations of women from suffering this pay penalty. Labour's shadow minister for women and equalities Gloria De Piero said the party would call on big companies to publish their gender pay gap . ‘Even when men and women are doing similar level jobs there is still a significant pay gap. ‘It seems that far too many women are also being passed over for promotion and are not receiving just reward for their hard work and talent.’ Separate data by The Fawcett Society found that the gender pay gap means women will effectively ‘work for free for the next 57 days of the year’. The campaigning group decides when to hold Equal Pay Day based on the point in the year at which women effectively stop earning because they are paid less than men. It said the day had to start three days earlier this year because the pay gap is growing. Last year, ONS data showed the pay gap was widening for the first time in years. The World Economic Forum (WEF) announced last month found Britain had dropped eight places in their worldwide gender equality table to 26th place - lagging behind Latvia, Burundi, South Africa, Rwanda and Nicaragua. Yesterday, Labour called on big companies with more than 250 staff to publish their average hourly pay gap each year to expose whether men and women are being paid differently for doing the same work, and whether too few women occupy senior positions. Gloria De Piero MP, Labour’s shadow minister for women and equalities said: ‘Women are working an extra three days for free this year because the pay gap is back on the rise. ‘Women shouldn’t have to wait another 50 years for Equal Pay which is why Labour will be calling a vote in Parliament to get big companies to publish their pay gap.’","Women are half as likely as men to have a job paying more than £50,000 .

"A supply teacher has resigned from a primary school after she allegedly put sticky tape over the mouth of a nine year-old child to 'keep her quiet'. The teacher, who has not been named, taught at Fowlmere Primary in the pretty village of Fowlmere, Cambridgeshire. The incident, which took place earlier this month, was apparently meant as a joke but concerned parents at the school have slammed it as 'worrying' and 'completely unacceptable'. Fowlmere Primary in Cambridgeshire (pictured) has apologised to the pupil's parents following the incident . The school, which is rated 'good' by school's inspectorate Ofsted, has apologised to the girl's parents and said the matter was investigated and the teacher has now resigned. A Cambridgeshire County Council spokesman said: 'A full investigation has taken place and the supply teacher spoken to. 'Although there was no ill intent or unkindness intended, it is clear this incident should not have happened and the member of staff has resigned from their post. 'We have spoken to the child's parents and apologised as this fell below the standards we expect.' But the incident has left parents concerned. One parent, who did not want to be named, said: 'It doesn't matter whether it was a joke or not. However tempting it is to do something like this it is completely unacceptable and very worrying.' Deborah Roberts, a former Fowlmere school governor and a district and parish councillor for the village, said she was satisfied with the response from the school. She said: 'I have every confidence that the people in charge at Fowlmere Primary, the headteacher and the governors, have done whatever was needed to be done and have handled this properly. 'The teacher has resigned and I would think there is really no further need for any parent to be concerned.' However, Chris McGovern, a former headmaster and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the supply teacher should be retrained. He said: 'You simply cannot do this with children, the incident would have been very damaging to the child. 'If you feel the need to tape a child's mouth up you should not be in the profession at all. A Cambridgeshire County Council (pictured) spokesman said: 'Although there was no ill intent or unkindness intended, it is clear this incident should not have happened' 'The only explanation is that the teacher must have lost control, they must have not been able to cope with the child. 'Saying it was a joke is a feeble excuse. You cannot inflict that sort of harm as a joke, it isn't a joke for the child. 'If you are resorting to those tactics you may as well pack it in and go home, and that seems to be what this teacher has done. 'This is completely inappropriate, it can't be allowed to happen. The teacher needs to be retrained.' Claude Knights, director of children's charity Kidscape,  said the act was a form of child abuse. She said: 'An affective and properly trained teacher would not use that action. Children should know there is a time for quiet and a time for speaking and there are ways and means to do that. 'But putting sticky tape on a child's mouth can never be seen as acceptable. It's child abuse really. The parents of that child should rightfully be up in arms. It makes them a laughing stock to their peers. 'It's a way of ridiculing the child, it's a hard-hitting form of bulling. It says to the rest of the class that it is acceptable for them to do that so it has a ricochet effect on how that child is treated by their peers. 'The imbalance of power makes it a very sinister development, it's a breach of trust that is severe for the child. Saying it's a joke is an immature excuse.' This is not the first incident of its kind. In March this year, an art teacher at a Somerset school was suspended following claims she lined up pupils, put sticky tape over their mouths and demanded they keep it on for the duration of the lesson.","Supply teacher  allegedly placed the sticky tape on the child's face 'as a joke'

"A picture may say a thousand words but a picture and a tune together - well, that says at least a thousand more. That's the premise behind the new British social network, hoping to overtake Instagram in the popularity stakes. Tunepics , invented by 33-year-old British marketeer Justin Cooke, allows users to feature a song with every image that they share, capturing the emotion behind a moment. The Tunepics concept is to capture the emotion behind every picture that users share to add emotion to the picture sharing experience . The British social network is growing at a rate of 100,000 new sign-ups a week and so far celebrity users include Jamie Oliver, Kate Bosworth, Adele, will.i.am, The Libertines, Natalie Imbruglia and Richard Branson. There are also accounts for Cara Delevingne with over 23,000 followers and Rihanna with almost 22,000 followers - although Tunepics couldn't officially confirm they're the real deal. At Tunepic Towers, they take celebrity verification very seriously and request passport information before placing a little note symbol next to the username (which means an account is verified as legit). Fashion brands like Asos, Hunter, Paul Smith and Chloe are also getting in on the act. In a perfect example of how music can bring a picture to life, this weekend Jamie Oliver posted an inspiring image of Malala Yousafzai, the youngest ever Nobel peace prize winner, with a stirring backing track of Ennio Morricone's The Mission. His previous post of an open fire pizza oven was amusingly accompanied by Burn Baby Burn by Ash. The 100,000 new users a week include Kate Bosworth (left), who posted this selfie along with Lana Del Rey's version of the American national anthem, and Jamie Oliver (right), who uploaded a picture of himself with rapper Example, along with one of the rapper's tracks . Kate Bosworth's weekend postings included an image of a lion chilling on its back along with Bob Marley's Turn Your Lights Down Low. Rather than the slew of selfies and 'I'm having more fun than you' snaps that dominate other social networks, Tunepics allows people to share a moment and a feeling. To add to the emotional Tunepics experience, when followers respond to posts, they don't just 'like' an image but use an 'emotion wheel' to show if they're 'inspired', 'happy' or 'dancing' to the post. Founder and CEO Justin  says it was his own picture-music-mash-up moment that inspired the idea. 'I was walking along the King’s Road in London, I took a photograph of some autumn leaves and then I went in my iTunes library and played Paolo Nutini’s Autumn. It was the most incredible feeling, I had goosebumps and I couldn’t stop looking at the photo,' he tells MailOnline. 'That was  about three years ago and I remember thinking, ""Wow, imagine if you could just capture a feeling in a moment"". It just felt like the most natural thing in the world,' says 33-year-old Justin. He was convinced that someone would come up with the idea - but they didn't, so he decided to create it himself. Who has the audacity to compete with giants like Facebook and Instagram for a slice of the social media action? Someone who was made vice president of Burberry aged 25 and then went onto head up Topshop marketing, perhaps. Left: Celebrities like will.i.am are amongst users; Right:  MTV posted this image of (left to right) Jessi J, Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande ahead of the VMAs . When Angela Ahrendts wanted to make Burberry young and fashionable again, Justin was her right hand tech man. He was part of the team that created fashion firsts such as live-stream catwalk shows and click-and-buy catwalk technology. Soon Sir Philip Green came knocking and poached him to head up marketing for Topshop. Inspired by his mentor Sir Philip, Justin decided to set up alone and turn his Tunepics idea into reality. To help get the idea off the ground he set up a marketing agency, innovate7, for a little extra cash flow, which now has Chelsea Football Club, Nike, Coca-Cola as clients, . 'I love the idea that we can redefine the way people share and discover moments of their lives. When you hear a song and you look at a picture you can remember how things smell it awakens all your senses. Its like redefining the photo album and the mixtape all in one,' he says. 'Social media allows you to travel through time in a way, as it takes you back to memories and moments – or even looking forward to something. 'Tunepics is a place where you can capture the magic of your life and share the emotion behind that moment. 'Music is probably the most powerful way to bring all of those feelings to the surface, but there are many layers of Tunepics – whether that’s touching the emotion wheel, or the memories that a tunepic triggers,' he adds. MTV posted these snaps of Afrojack (left) and Neon Jungle (right) performing, along with tracks from their concerts . So does he think his all singing all dancing version of Instagram could overtake its big brother? 'There are incredible social platforms out there, and I would never want to say that we’re better or that we’re doing something that they can’t do, there’s space for everyone. 'I think it would be arrogant for us to assume that we’re going to be as big as them – but it’s something that we absolutely dream of. I think every great idea has to start with a big ambition and a big dream. 'We think we are building a social network for tomorrows generation – it’s the future and it will take time but people seem to love it. Have you ever met anyone in your life who doesn’t like music? That’s a pretty great start point. 'I don’t think there’s a single moment in my life where music isn’t relevant, and this is really about allowing people to capture that. 'It’s fun, it’s simple and intuitive,' he adds. Tunepics users can search from over 35 million songs to feature with their images by using keywords and they can also add an array of filters to boost photos. An innovative weather filter helps heighten the mood of a moment by adding sunshine, rain, snow, raindrops or a rainbow to a snap. With over 500 million pictures uploaded to the Internet every day and over 100 million songs downloaded every week, Tunepics could be the perfect marrying of our two biggest online obsessions.","Invented by 33-year-old Brit Justin Cooke of Burberry and Topshop pedigree .

"The most bizarre twist in the Huhne saga came on a January night in 2013 when, by pure chance, a Mail on Sunday journalist learned for the first time of the extent of the police spying operation mounted against this newspaper. The paper’s News Editor David Dillon – who had met both Huhne’s ex-wife Vicky Pryce and her friend, judge Constance Briscoe – was having a snack in the Stick and Bowl Chinese restaurant just yards from our offices in Kensington, West London at around 9.30pm. He didn’t pay much attention when a well-dressed blonde woman in her 40s sat down next to him at one of the communal tables in the tiny diner. Scroll down for video . Chris Huhne's lawyer Jane Glass, who was rumbled in a Chinese restaurant by the Mail on Sunday News Editor . Having ordered food, she opened a file of papers which consisted of a series of spreadsheets. Dillon happened to glance across – and to his astonishment, saw his own name jumping out at him, alongside his mobile phone number. Then he noticed the names of Pryce, Briscoe and our original source, freelance journalist Andrew Alderson, who the MoS had mounted a £150,000 legal battle to keep anonymous. The spreadsheet was entitled: ‘Kent Police. Operation Solar Chronological telephone data.’ One column gave the duration of calls and other columns the numbers and the names. Mystified as to how the woman could have obtained confidential information, Dillon asked her if she was a journalist. The Stick and Bowl Chinese restaurant in Kensington, where the Mail on Sunday man saw his name on secret papers . The woman said she was not a journalist, nor a police officer. Dillon, 48, recalled: ‘She then asked me why I was asking and I told her that I had seen my name on the paperwork. 'She became very flustered and prepared to leave even though her meal had only just arrived. As she stood I asked her if she was a lawyer and she said, “I am Chris Huhne’s lawyer,” adding, “You must be David Dillon” then she hurried out. She seemed embarrassed.’ The diner was later identified as Jane Glass, a partner of law firm Burton Copeland.","News editor David Dillon was having a snack at a Chinese restaurant .

"The Deputy Prime Minister wrote the Lib Dems would push for a 'daddy month' if elected again for new fathers to enjoy time off . A ‘Daddy Month’ plan to boost new fathers’ rights to paternity leave was promised by Nick Clegg last night. The Deputy Prime Minister wants to increase statutory paid paternity leave from two weeks to four. The pledge came as Mr Clegg lashed out at ‘dinosaur’ critics who opposed his call last week to let fathers share mothers’ parental leave to look after a new child. In an article for the Mumsnet website last night, the Liberal Democrat leader confirmed that he wanted to double new fathers’ current entitlement of up to two weeks – worth about £138 a week from the state. Mr Clegg wrote: ‘In Government again, the Lib Dems would introduce a ""daddy month"" – a new, additional use-it-or-lose-it block of time for new dads to stay at home. ‘We know more men want to be more involved with their children at home.’ The vow comes after Mr Clegg came under fire last week for calling for private employers to copy a new Civil Service scheme which, from next year, will let fathers share the far more generous paid time off currently available for new mothers. Mr Clegg’s call sparked concern from business leaders who warned company bosses would not welcome new rules on paid paternity and maternity leave. But last night, the Deputy Prime Minister insisted he had never suggested saddling firms with more costs – stressing that as couples would share their parental leave entitlement, there would be no extra cost to employers. ‘For every day a man spends at home, a woman will be back at work – so what’s the problem?’ he asked. The Lib Dem leader said more men wanted to be involved with their children at home (image posed by models) Mr Clegg accused his critics of actually saying that while companies can afford to lose a woman for a few months, they could not put up with losing a man for that long. He added: ‘What utter rubbish – a sorry glimpse into the dated misogyny that still stalks part of the British Establishment. ‘It feels ridiculous for me even to write that women are as valuable to their employers as their male counterparts. ‘Of course they are. And yet it seems the flamingly obvious still needs to be said.’","Nick Clegg slammed 'dinosaur' critics who opposed fathers sharing leave .

"A woman who had lap band surgery six years ago is warning people against having the procedure, despite losing 32 kilograms in 12 months. Tracey Bruce, from Brisbane, thought she had finally found the solution to all her weight issues when she had the surgery in 2008. But now Ms Bruce wishes she never had the lap band done in the first place. Scroll down for video . Before (left in 2008) and after (right in 2009) shots of Tracey Bruce who says she would never had lapband surgery again . She withdrew $15,000 from her super to fund the procedure which would make it possible for her to have a knee surgery . Her story, which will air on SBS2's The Feed on Monday at 7.30pm, emerges as two Australian doctors call on weight loss surgeries to be made more accessible through the public health system. University of Western Sydney surgery professor Michael Edye and senior lecturer of surgery at St George Hospital Dr Michael Talbot penned an editorial in the Medical Journal of Australia arguing for the move. Professor Edye and Dr Talbot wrote there was 'solid evidence that the expense of surgery will be offset by reduced costs of managing comorbid conditions, yielding improved quality and length of life, as well as by reduced costs of medication and food'. The professor told ABC Radio on Monday morning there were people who were 'sick with obesity'. Ms Bruce (pictured with her husband, Peter, two months before her surgery in 2009, weighing about 118 kilograms . The now 49-year-old is pictured here in her belly dancing outfit in 2011, weighing about 90 kilograms . 'They're diabetic, they're suffering from kidney ailments, from eye disease, from nerve complaints related to their diabetes, and their lives will be shortened if they don't have something done.' he said. 'In these situations, surgery offers something that is truly life-prolonging.' But Tracey Bruce, 49, said it was 'really scary' to hear the surgeons were keen on the idea to introduce weight loss surgeries to the public health system. Ms Bruce said the surgery was having the desired effect for the first 12 months after she had it done. She withdrew $15,000 from her super to fund the procedure which would make it possible for her to have a knee surgery which her specialist would only do if she lost some weight. At the time, Ms Bruce was 121 kilograms. 'I've been a big girl since I was 16 and my knee basically said ""I'm not carting you around... anymore "" and they gave up,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I went to see a specialist and he said I needed a knee replacement. 'He told me I needed to lose 60 kilograms before he would do the surgery.' Ms Bruce and her husband on their wedding day in October 2009 when she weighed 81 kilograms . She said she would never have the surgery again because of the ongoing health issues she has had because of the procedure (pictured here in 2012) When she finally had the weight loss surgery, Ms Bruce was 116 kilograms and within a year she weighed 80 kilograms. But soon the Brisbane woman ran into trouble. When the time came to tighten the band around the top of her stomach for the first time, surgeons had trouble finding the port which helped filter the saline solution into the chord that restricts the portion of food being consumed. It was discovered the port had been placed in the wrong place and could not be reached without causing Ms Bruce extreme pain and discomfort. Later on, it also emerged the saline solution had been leaking into her body and causing her to get sick. 'I would get these purple and black bruises after fills which were probably eight to nine centimetres across and probably the same width. They were just horrid,' she said. Ms Bruce said she also had been in out of hospital with diverticulitis - a digestive illness that inflames the inside of the bowel walls - and suffered more regularly from migraines. 'You’re pretty much an open book to infections and my white cell count was down,' she said. 'I’d rather be fat and happy rather than go through that again.' Despite dropping the pounds quickly by August 2009 (right), Ms Bruce has since put the weight back on (left in 2013) Her warning against the surgery comes as two Australian doctors call for weight loss surgeries to be more accessible through the public health system . But it was not just the hospital trips that has put Ms Bruce off the idea of weight loss surgeries. She has to exercise extreme discipline when eating, making sure she takes small sips and bites or she risks the chance of throwing up her food. 'When you eat too much of it, you vomit. There's no warning whatsoever,' Ms Bruce said. 'To sit down with friends at a cafe, it would take 45 minutes for me to finish a cup of coffee whereas it would take my friends 10 minutes. 'It would be pretty embarrassing to throw it back up. 'It has cost me a lot in handbags, as my husband would say, because I would vomit up in handbags.' Ms Bruce said if she could go back in time she would not have opted for the surgery and she was not alone in her suffering. 'There are not many who have been having a good time with this thing [lap band surgery],' Ms Bruce said. 'The awareness of the failure rate of these things needs to be known. It's not the greatest thing ever to do. 'People will go into this and think it's a miracle cure but it's not.' Ms Bruce said supportive friends and family had really helped her through the difficult time. She is more hopeful for the future, having had a full replacement on October 14. 'Three weeks ago I wanted it removed. I can't cope with being sick all the time but I spoke to a really good surgeon and he said to me I would really like you to give it one more go,' Ms Bruce said. 'But if anything else happens, I'm getting it removed... I'm never having weight loss surgery again.'","Tracey Bruce weighed 116 kilograms when she had surgery in 2008 .

"A professional cage fighter has been jailed for 19 years for repeatedly stabbing his pregnant ex-girlfriend - in an attempt to kill her unborn child. Nicholas Leaning, 28, stabbed Lauren Oliver five times in the stomach when she was seven months pregnant in a bid to conceal that he was  the father. A jury took just 90 minutes to find Leaning guilty of attempted child destruction and wounding with intent, and was today jailed at Hull Crown Court with a judge describing him as a 'ticking time bomb'. Cage fighter Nicholas Leaning (left) has been jailed for 19 years for repeatedly stabbing his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Lauren Oliver (right) Leaning, from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, was cleared by the same jury of attempted murder. Members of his family shouted 'I love you', 'I will sort this son,' and 'no matter what happens we love you baby', as he was taken from the dock to begin his prison term. During a week-long trial, the court heard how the cage fighter carried out the brutal attack on his ex-girlfriend of two-years after she discovered he had resumed a relationship with a former partner. Simon Waley, prosecuting, said: 'He had been seeing both of these women for some time and they discovered this among themselves. 'Lauren had become pregnant. When the defendant learned of the pregnancy he had tried to  persuade her to have an abortion and when she said she didn't want to, he became angry and said he didn't want to have anything to do with the child. 'He began to indicate to others that the child wasn't his and he hadn't been sleeping with Lauren for some time. 'Lauren and Lindsay had been in touch with each other and had been on friendly terms and arranged a DNA test to determine who was the father. 'He said he would not participate in such a test so Lindsay said she would allow DNA from their child to be used.' The jury heard how Leaning attacked Miss Oliver at her home in Belton, Lincolnshire, as she returned from dropping her daughter at school on the morning of June 11. As she opened her front door, he plunged a knife into her stomach and pushed her on to the floor where he made four further stab wounds - threatening the life of her unborn baby. The jury was played evidence from Miss Oliver, who described what happened and said she knew 'what he was going for'. A jury found Leaning (pictured) guilty of attempted child destruction and wounding with intent . She said: 'I knew it was him and I knew what he was going for. He was trying to kill the baby. 'It was like he was enjoying it because he was smiling. I pleaded with him not to kill me and my baby. 'He stabbed me five times. I felt a massive gush of blood between my legs and I thought my baby was dead.' Miss Oliver said Leaning wore a cage fighting mask during the attack, which he wore for training, as well as a dark hoodie, blue jeans and a black and red baseball cap. She said: 'All I could see was his eyes staring at me. 'The first stab took me down. I bent forward and then he pushed me and he was standing over the top of me. 'He was trying to get the knife in as many times as he could. I was shouting ""someone help me please"", and ""Nick please stop it"". 'Eventually he got up and ran away. It's just sick.' Following the stabbing, Leaning fled from the scene and Miss Oliver was taken to hospital where her baby girl was born by emergency caesarean, just hours later. The court heard that the baby, now seven months old, is healthy despite the attack. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mr Waley said the attack had 'changed everything about her life'. He said: 'She's scared when she's at home. It's affected her ability to eat and sleep, she's attended counselling on a regular basis and suffers from anxiety.' Mr Waley also said Miss Oliver is now too afraid to go out alone and cannot feel able to allow her older daughter to play outside for fear of having the doors unlocked. The court was told that Miss Oliver still has visible scars from the stab wounds, which can be 'uncomfortable and unpleasant'. During the trial, the jury heard how Leaning and Miss Oliver had been in a 'great' relationship for around two years before she discovered he had rekindled a relationship with his ex-partner Lindsay Coombs. The pair split in November last year - but Miss Oliver then discovered she was pregnant with his child. She claims he made repeated instructions to her to abort the baby, but she refused. She said: 'I went to see Lindsay and she showed me pictures and messages and everything to prove they were together. 'We found out he had been with us both all along. 'I found out I was pregnant, and when I told him he told me to I had to go and get an abortion, but I didn't want to. 'He was nice at first saying ""it's not right"", but when I said I couldn't go through with it, he got mad. 'He said he would kick it out of me if he had to. He said I had to get rid of it but when I wouldn't, he said he didn't want anything to do with it.' It was then that Leaning's former partner Lindsay demanded a DNA test to confirm the paternity of the baby - something he refused to co-operate with. Leaning (pictured) wore a cage fighting mask during the attack, knifing Miss Oliver five times in the stomach while she was pregnant . 'She wanted a DNA test and I said they could have one,' said Miss Oliver. 'He was trying to tell everyone it wasn't his and he wasn't happy that the DNA test was going to be done because he knew it would prove it was his baby. 'Lindsay was messaging me and said I could use their daughter to do the test. She wanted to know if the baby was his.' The court heard that Leaning was arrested around an hour after the incident at his home address in Scunthorpe. Mr Waley said that he gave a number of conflicting accounts as to his whereabouts on the morning. During police questioning, Leaning finally admitted being at Lauren's property where he said she had shouted at him and 'came at him with a knife'. Mr Waley added: 'It's absurd that a 34-week pregnant Lauren launched an attack on her cage fighter ex-boyfriend and then went on to stab herself and her unborn baby five times in an act of spite against the defendant.' Judge Jeremy Richardson QC described Leaning as a 'ticking timebomb' and said: 'Something had to be done and it was.' Jailing him, Judge Richardson added: 'This is an exceptionally serious case of its kind. It calls for an exceptional sentence to reflect the malignancy of your violent behaviour where you brutally stabbed a pregnant woman five times in order to kill her unborn child. 'I repeat - you intended to kill that child and it is only good fortune that prevented the execution of that truly wicked objective. 'It is good fortune alone that has resulted in the child suffering no long term effects of that trauma. The same cannot be said for the mother. She is scared both physically and mentally by what you did. 'You have been found guilty by a jury upon clear evidence. That jury has seen through the entirely bogus account you presented in your trial. 'You intended really serious injury upon Lauren Oliver and you concurrently intended, by seriously wounding her, that the life of the baby, which was at seven months gestation in her womb, would be extinguished. 'You have not shown a shred of remorse for what you did. Indeed, you have made outrageous assertions that Lauren Oliver stabbed herself and attempted to kill her own baby as an act of revenge for you choosing your former partner over her. 'Let there be no mistake that this is a very serious example of a crime of this kind. This is not simply a case of a brutal and sustained attack upon a vulnerable woman who happened to be pregnant, but a vicious attack with a knife upon a pregnant woman intending to kill the unborn baby. 'You wanted to kill that unborn infant and you set about that task with calculated determination. It was a vile act.' Following the sentencing, Detective Inspector Alan Curtis from Humberside Police, said: 'Nineteen years is a long time for Nicholas Leaning to think about what he's done in prison and it reflects the grotesque nature of the attack and the fact that Lauren Oliver really was vital to his ultimate aim which was to kill the unborn baby. 'You don't come across pregnant ladies that are stabbed in broad daylight, on their doorsteps. It was pre-meditated, it was calculated, it was planned and it was a despicable act. It was only a pure miracle that they survived. 'They will still carry mental and physical scars for the rest of their lives but it could have been far worse.'","Nicholas Leaning knifed Lauren Oliver five times in the stomach, court told .

"A shocking video has allegedly revealed two well-known Mexican reporters being paid off by a notorious drug cartel king. The 25-minute video, which was published on Sunday by Mexican news site MVS, shows drug lord Servando Gomez Martinez doling out cash to TV correspondent Eliseo Caballero, who works for Televisa, Mexico’s largest network, and Jose Luis Diaz, who owns crime-focused news agency Esquema. Diaz provides news coverage and photos for networks including the Associated Press, CNN and Mundo Fox, He also works as a fixer in the volatile Michoacan region of Mexico for foreign journalists. Scroll down for video . The videotape was sent anonymously to Mexican news site MVS, which claims the identities of the men are drug lord Servando Gomez, TV correspondent Eliseo Caballero and crime journalist Jose Luis Diaz . Caballero works with Mexico's largest TV network while Jose Luis Diaz owns crime-focused news agency Esquema which works alongside international news companies . On the video tape, the three sit at a plastic table in a sparse, brightly-lit room and talk about a 'communications strategy', MVS reported, in order to improve the image of the cartel in the press. Money can be seen exchanging hands between the drug kingpin and the two reporters. The journalists also appear to ask the drug lord for equipment. Servando Gomez Martinez is also known as 'La Tuta' (the teacher) and El Profe (the professor)  - as he was once a teacher. He is head of the Knights Templar Cartel and was also a founding member of La Familia Michoacana drug cartel, a group which split from the Knights. Both journalists told MVS that they had accepted money from the drug lord. Jose Luis Diaz (pictured left) who has his own crime-focused news agency and TV correspondent Eliseo Caballero (right) said they cooperated with the cartel because they feared for their and their family's lives . However the two veteran reporters said that they were forced to attend the meeting and were in fear for their lives and the lives of their families. Drug kingpin Servando Gomez Martinez has reached out to the media in the past about his cartel - claiming they were not a cartel . Paul Colford, Director of Media Relations for The Associated Press, said in a statement to MailOnline today: 'The Associated Press has used Jose Luis Diaz Perez, director of the Michoacan news agency Esquema, on a freelance basis - primarily for video services and the use of its cameramen.' Televisa was not available for comment when contacted by MailOnline today but the company previously said that Caballero was fired after the video came to light. Agencia Esquema was similarly unreachable for comment today but was publishing news on its website. Calls to CNN and Mundo Fox were not returned on Tuesday at the time of publication. Servando Gomez Martinez sits at the top of an organization which is feared, like many of Mexico's most vicious cartels, for its beheadings and assassinations. However in 2012, Martinez gave an interview to Blog Del Narco, a highly-respected 'war on drugs' site, saying that his cartel wanted to join forces with others and bring down a leader of the feared Los Zetas cartel. He described his organization as a 'necessary evil' and saying that Knights Templar were not a cartel but a 'brotherhood'. Mexican journalists are often targeted and killed by drug cartels for reporting on their activities. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based advocacy group, reveals that 30 journalists have been murdered in Mexico since 1992.","A video, published by Mexican news site MVS, allegedly shows reporters Eliseo Caballero and Jose Luis Diaz, taking pay-offs from a drug lord .

"Police should face time limits on how long a person can languish on bail without being charged, the Home Secretary will say today. Theresa May is demanding action amid mounting anger that police forces are abusing their powers by keeping people in a legal limbo for ‘months or even years’ – only to be told they would not face any action. The issue has been highlighted by a number of high-profile cases, including celebrities and journalists, who have been left on bail for long periods – often with strict curbs to their freedom – without charges being pressed. Theresa May is demanding action amid mounting anger that police forces are abusing their powers by keeping people in a legal limbo for ‘months or even years’ Last week, the veteran disc jockey Paul Gambaccini, arrested in October last year by officers from Operation Yewtree, the inquiry launched in the wake of the late Sir Jimmy Savile being unmasked as a prolific paedophile, was informed he would not face sexual assault charges. The DJ, who was investigated over historic allegations of molesting two teenage boys, told of his ‘12 months of horror and trauma’ having his name dragged through the mud. The College of Policing, the professional body that sets police standards, has expressed concern over suspects being repeatedly re-bailed as it appears to be being used as a ‘quasi-judicial punishment’. Last week, veteran disc jockey Paul Gambaccini (left), arrested in October last year by officers from Operation Yewtree, the inquiry launched in the wake of the late Sir Jimmy Savile (right) being unmasked as a paedophile . The organisation has just concluded a review into how police and other law enforcement agencies use pre-charge bail in criminal investigations. But in a speech to the College’s annual conference in Coventry, Mrs May will order it to consult on introducing time limits on how long a person can spend on bail. Acknowledging it was a ‘sensitive area’, she said: ‘We must also look at statutory time limits on the use of pre-charge bail to prevent people spending months or even years on bail only for no charges to be brought.’ Mrs May declined to propose a possible time limit, but human rights group Liberty and the Law Society have suggested 28 days. Police are allowed 24 hours to keep a suspect for questioning after arrest before seeking a further period of detention from a judge. In practice, they often quiz a person then release them on pre-charge bail to return for further interview at a later date, giving officers time to build robust cases. But there are currently no restrictions on the length of time a person can spend on police bail which can force innocent people to put their lives on hold, pay thousands in legal fees and suffer the slow assassination of their characters. Conditions can also be placed on police bail, which can include curfews and restrictions on movement and financial transactions while an investigation continues. Comedian Jim Davidson (left) lashed out at the system after being kept on bail for eight months before being told he would not face any charges. Freddie Starr (right), another comedian, spent 19 months on bail after being arrested by officers investigating decades-old sex allegations made by 14 women . Comedian Jim Davidson lashed out at the system after being arrested under the Operation Yewtree and kept on bail for eight months before being told he would not face any charges. Freddie Starr, another comedian, spent 19 months on bail after being arrested by police investigating decades-old sex allegations made by 14 women. The case was dropped. Conservative MP Nigel Evans – who resigned as House of Commons deputy speaker before being cleared of sex assault charges in court in April – described the ‘indescribable torment, torture and stress’ of being left hanging on bail. He was eventually acquitted by a court of all charges of sexually assaulting Parliamentary researchers. Some 30 journalists are currently on bail – some for more than a year – while police investigate alleged crimes including phone hacking and paying public officials for stories. A Freedom of Information request in May last year found more than 57,000 people were on police bail at the time with more than 3,000 bailed for more than six months. Lord Macdonald, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, said recently: ‘There is sometimes a lack of urgency in police bail cases that is very worrying. Lives are put on hold and grave reputational damage goes unchecked, sometimes for years.’ Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, raised the issue during an evidence session with Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions. Referring to the 30 journalists on bail who do or did work for The Sun or now-defunct News of the World, he said: ‘They have been bailed and rebailed without being charged and have had their careers ruined because they have been suspended or lost their jobs. ‘It can’t be right that these people keep getting bailed and re-bailed.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Remarks in wake of celebrities and journalists being held 'in legal limbo'

"The crush is suffocating. All five of my senses are being bombarded, from the overpowering stench of a fellow commuter’s breath barely inches away (chicken balti was on the menu last night, I deduce) to the Tannoy announcements, played on a torturous endless loop, urging us repeatedly to ‘report unattended packages’ and ‘mind the gap’. Even the lighting is a visual assault. Suddenly there’s a sharp jab in my ribs: ‘Oi, mate,’ a man beside me says. ‘You’re invading my personal space.’ Personal space? If only there was such a luxury. I feel I am on more intimate terms with this man than I am with my own wife. I can smell we share the same brand of shaving gel. His hair, still shower damp, is brushing against my cheek with every jolt and lurch of the carriage. Scroll down for video . Michael Williams takes a ride on the most overcrowded train in Britain, the 7.32 from Woking to Waterloo . Welcome to the hell on wheels that is the 47-minute commute aboard Britain’s officially most overcrowded morning rush hour train, the 07.32 from Woking to London Waterloo. Last month this South West Trains service was named in a list of shame of the Top Ten overcrowded train services in Britain. According to the official Department for Transport figures, it’s overloaded by 154 per cent, meaning every morning there are 1,278 passengers playing a daily grim game of musical chairs for the 738 seats available. All this seems a terrible shame, since rail travel at its best can be one of the divine pleasures of life. As an author who spends much of his life writing about railways, no one loves trains more than me. That eminent railway traveller, Paul Theroux, once wrote: ‘I have seldom heard a train go by and not wished I was on it.’ Would he want to be on the 07.32 from Woking? I doubt it. The truth is that too much modern train travel has become like this, where we travel trapped in overpriced, garish, harshly lit, cacophonous, beeping plastic trains and squashed by a miserable mass of humanity. Fellow passenger Georgina Kelly, 27, from Woking, on her way to her job as a PA in the City is trying to stay cool, and ‘zoned out’ with her iPod earphones in her ears. ‘I rarely get a seat,’ she says. ‘And for that I have to pay £320 a month for my ticket.’ Our carriage sways and lurches — not helped by the fact the line is basically unchanged since Victorian times, with an antiquated ‘third rail’ power system — the train is powered by an electric track underneath as opposed to the more modern and efficient overhead electricity cables. The South West Trains service was named at the top of a list of shame recently, but bosses claim the antiquated railways are full, and that the company couldn't run more trains, even if it had them . They were introduced in the Twenties by the old Southern Railway and are now considered obsolete, yet no one has had the courage or resources to rip them out and start again. Maria Gines, 26, from Weybridge, on her way to a property management course, says: ‘What I hate is the crush and people with bad breath in your face. 'It’s so packed I once had someone fall asleep on my shoulder standing up. And people are often unkind to elderly people and young children in the crush.’ Pinstriped Andy Duncan, 45, on his way to his job in the City, is squashed in the corridor outside the First Class section, which is two-thirds empty, but — at around £5,000 for a season ticket, compared to £3,500 in standard class — prohibitively expensive. He says there are just too many excuses on the line. ‘They need to get their act together,’ he adds. ‘Last week, they cancelled this train. Can you imagine what hell it was on the one that followed?’ Hundreds of thousands across the UK suffer dire conditions like this on their daily scramble to work. A miserable one in five of the 545,000 passengers travelling into London on any morning has to stand, with trains serving Paddington, Euston and Victoria the worst. The chief of London’s biggest rail franchise, the Govia Thameslink, risked the wrath of passengers last week by saying he intended to tackle the problem of overcrowding by ‘making it easier to stand’. A euphemism for: ‘It’s getting worse, so take it or leave it.’ In the North, where many passengers have to stand for more than 20 minutes around Sheffield, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool, the trains are often even worse — with elderly carriages made of bus parts, running on four, harsh-riding wheels in the style of the vehicles pulled by Stephenson’s Rocket. Commuting wasn’t always as bad as this. Until the Eighties many commuter trains around the south of England had a buffet car, where you might treat yourself to a noggin or two to ease the pain on the way back from the office — and join your mates in the card schools which were features of such trains. London Waterloo is at capacity at both morning and evening peak, but infrastructure to alleviate this will cost billions, and Treasury funding is unlikely any time soon . Brighton line commuters could relax in armchairs in Art Deco luxury on the Brighton Belle, breakfasting on freshly grilled kippers with a cheering Bucks Fizz. Meanwhile, Edwardian era commuters on the Metropolitan Line into Baker Street could reserve seats in a Pullman car, where waiters in crisp uniforms would serve a full English breakfast amid the elegant mahogany marquetry, green damask blinds and thick carpets. No chance of this today, where not a single train south of the Thames any longer has a buffet car, and on my 07.32, even if one of the elusive snack trolleys could be squeezed aboard, it would be crushed out of shape. As if to confirm this, Barbara the guard announces as we reach Surbiton: ‘Due to sheer numbers of people on board, I can no longer walk down the train.’ No wonder, by the time we get to Waterloo, Britain’s busiest station, I’m limp and dizzy. In a mere 47-minute journey, I’ve morphed into ‘Mr Angry Commuter of Woking’ and I’m looking for someone to blame. In the old days I might have marched up to the stationmaster’s office and had a stiff word. But in the fragmented and Kafkaesque world of Britain’s railway system today, no one takes full responsibility any more. Ministers blame the train companies and the train firms blame Department for Transport bureaucrats. In this bizarre Alice In Wonderland structure, although the railways are privatised, no new trains can be built without the say-so of the Government. It’s a miserable fact that since privatisation 20 years ago, only around 6,000 new carriages have been built, and more than half our trains date from the old days of British Railways. To keep up, industry experts say we should increase this number eightfold, but the main problem is the ancient infrastructure built on the Woking line by the London and Southampton Railway in 1840. ‘Our railway is full, and even if we had more trains we couldn’t run them,’ Tim Shoveller, boss of South West Trains, tells me. ‘Waterloo is at capacity in the morning and evening peak.’ State-of-the-art infrastructure would cost a fortune — and the Treasury is unlikely to stump up any time soon. Ministers boast about London’s new £14.8 billion Crossrail commuter line, due to open in 2018. Yet the track record on improvements for London commuters is poor. The new Thameslink commuter line is expected to finally open in four years’ time — 18 years behind schedule at a cost of £6 billion. At the same time, ever more people are using the railways — with 1.6 billion annual passenger journeys, the highest ever, and rising. But this isn’t because we’re all hooked on the joy of the train. Many are motorists put off by road congestion, or young people who can no longer afford a car. Rail travel used to be more pleasant. Travellers on the the Brighton Belle could breakfast on kippers and Bucks Fizz on the way to work (pictured, Laurence Olivier and Joan Plowright on board) But most are the poor bloody commuters — driven into the outer suburbs by sky-high London property prices. The number of commuters travelling into the capital has risen by a third in the past four years alone. Which means that Georgina, Maria and Andy on the Woking line — and others like them — are condemned to the hell of their daily commute, trapped in a ratchet of ever-higher season ticket costs. Season tickets will rise by 2.5 per cent in the New Year, hiking yet again the most expensive fares in Europe. Ministers pledge the rise will fund future rail improvements. Scant comfort for many of us who will never see it in our lifetimes. Mariko Fryatt, 30, from Esher, a City banker, spends £2,000 a year on her commute, most of which is spent in the aisle, yet confesses: ‘This is nothing compared to my home city of Tokyo, where they employ pushers to squash people on to the crammed trains.’ Please Mariko, I beg. Keep that suggestion to yourself. Michael Williams’s latest book The Trains Now Departed is to be published by Penguin Random House in spring 2015.","The 07.32 from Woking to London Waterloo is most crowded train in UK .

"Apprentice contestant James Hill, 27, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, was convicted of assaulting two men . A contestant on Lord Sugar's Apprentice show who claimed 'I'm very, very aggressive' is a convicted thug who assaulted two men, biting one's ear, it emerged today. James Hill, 27, beat up a bus driver who was talking to his girlfriend, hitting him with 'punch after punch' in an unprovoked attack that left the victim scarred for life.  Months later, he was involved in another brawl in which he bit a man's ear. Today the would-be star from Chesterfield, who hopes to win the £250,000 top prize in the Apprentice, said he 'very much regrets' the two assaults, for which he was given an 18-month suspended jail sentence after admitting them at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court. Hill apologised after his first victim, who asked not to be named, told how Hill attacked him after he chatted to his girlfriend in a bar owned by the entrepreneur's father. The victim, who said he knew the young woman as she worked at a local soft play centre, told the Sun: 'Hill stormed over and began throwing his fists - he threw punch after punch.' He said he fell to the floor and looked up, only to see a boot coming towards his face. Hill was dragged off by bouncers who told the victim he should call the police. He said: 'He was always starting fights and they wanted someone to teach him a lesson.' As Hill waited for his court case, he got into trouble again, this time biting a man's ear on Christmas Eve 2008. After the second attack, Hill was arrested and appeared at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court on March 2 2009, where he was charged under his full name of Anthony James Hill and admitted two counts of assault. In July that year he was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended, ordered to pay his victims £300 and £200 respectively, and told to pay £755 costs. Now Hill, who started out in business washing cars, now runs several businesses including selling vending machines and running his own bar and restaurant. He describes himself as enthusiastic and energetic, and said: 'Me and Lord Sugar could build an empire together. I think I am him when he was my age.' A new series of the reality business show launched this week, with 6.6million viewers watching Hill battle it out against 19 other would-be high-fliers to win £250,000 investment from Lord Sugar. However the victims of his attacks are said to be aghast at the prospect of Hill becoming a highly-paid celebrity. The boys' team: Hill, seen second from left in the back row, hopes to win the reality entrepreneur show . Hill, fifth from right in red tie, is one of the hopefuls to be judged by Karren Brady, Lord Sugar, and Nick Hewer . Contestant Hill, seen in the centre pitching his product, believes his is 'Lord Sugar when he was my age' The bus driver he assaulted said he was surprised the BBC had left Hill take part, while the victim of the second attack didn't want to comment on it but his father said he thought Hill's criminal past might make him a less attractive winner from Lord Sugar's point of view. A spokesman for The Apprentice told MailOnline: 'It is a spent conviction under the provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and therefore James was eligible to apply for the programme.' A spokesman for Hill said:  'James is not proud of what happened.  He was young and irresponsible and very much regrets - and has learned from - his actions.'","James Hill, 27, from Chesterfield, is hoping to win Lord Sugar's show .

"They may dance for tips, but strippers in Las Vegas will now get a minimum wage after a court ruling that may saddle gentlemen’s clubs in Sin City with back pay dues of up to $40m dollars. In a legal decision for strip clubs in the top tourist destination, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled yesterday that dancers at one Las Vegas club are employees, not independent contractors, and are entitled to be paid a minimum wage. For decades dancers have worked for tips and even paid 'house fees' for the right to entertain. The ruling will affect up to 6,500 current and former performers in the desert destination, according to an attorney who took the class-action lawsuit on behalf of six dancers at Sapphire Gentlemen's Club. Strippers will be paid the Nevada state minimum wage of $8.25 per hour, but less if they receive tips (file photo) The High Court said: 'Given that Sapphire bills itself as the 'World's Largest Strip Club,' and not, say, a sports bar or nightclub, we are confident that the women strip-dancing there are useful and indeed necessary to its operation.' Mick Rusing, the Tucson, Arizona, attorney who represented plaintiff Zuri-Kinshasa Maria Terry and five other dancers in the initial case, said the ruling might directly effect more than 6,500 current and former members of the affected class, dating to about 2006. Rusing said they could be entitled to a combined $40 million in back wages, plus the return of house fees. 'And it keeps going up every month,' Rusing said. 'As employees, you get a lot of rights. The girls are entitled to be paid. At very least, minimum wage.' Sapphire officials and the attorneys who represented the company before the Supreme Court didn't immediately respond to messages. The Supreme Court ruling, written by Justice Kristina Pickering, declared clubs are not exempt from provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. Sapphire Gentlemen's Club in  Las Vegas party town in Nevada bills itself as the 'World's Largest Strip Club' That includes worker compensation and sexual harassment rules, Rusing said. 'Sapphire argues that the performers had no 'contract of hire' and alternatively that the performers were not 'in the service of' Sapphire,' the ruling said. It declares signed entertainment agreements detailing terms under which Sapphire permitted performers to dance 'an express contract of hire,' and dismisses Sapphire's assertions that the performers 'never intended to be employees.' The high court sent the case back to Clark County District Court for hearings to determine how much the plaintiffs are owed. The Nevada state minimum wage is $8.25 per hour, although some service employees are paid less if they also receive tips. Ryan Anderson, a Las Vegas attorney who once was involved in the lawsuit, said the ruling will change forever the relationship between companies that enlist dancers to entice customers into their clubs and dancers whose income has been paid by patrons. Anderson in recent years has been recruiting dancers as potential clients for independent cases to recover back wages and benefits at other clubs. He guessed there are about two dozen topless, strip and nude clubs in Las Vegas, and he noted the ruling covers the entire state. He said he didn't think the ruling would cripple the clubs. Rusing noted that other courts in other states have issued similar rulings, and that strip clubs have adopted rules to comply. 'They're going to have to do business differently,' Anderson said. 'They're going to have to sit down with an employment attorney and determine what they're going to have to have when they hire a dancer.'

"Alton Nolen, the Muslim convert accused of beheading a female colleague in Oklahoma last week, has been charged with first-degree murder in the gruesome killing. Nolen, 30, was also charged with assault and battery with a deadly weapon for the grisly attack at Vaughan Foods in Moore last Thursday, Cleveland County prosecutor Greg Mashburn said. The DA added that officials will likely pursue the death penalty in the case. Nolen was fired from his job on Thursday after Traci Johnson - a co-worker he later attacked - said she had had an altercation with Nolen 'about him not liking white people', Mashburn said. Nolen then allegedly returned home and fetched a knife and 'returned to get revenge', the prosecutor said. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Charged: Alton Nolen, 30, (pictured left in an earlier mug shot and right) has been charged with first-degree murder in the beheading of a Vaughan Foods plant worker Colleen Hufford . The criminal complaint released today states that Nolen drove to his home 'for the sole reason to retrieve a large bladed knife'. He then went back to work 'with the large knife in his shoe, in order to assault an employee of the business with the knife.' He walked into the plant's administrative office and came across 54-year-old Colleen Hufford, whom he attacked from behind, severing her head. He then turned his attention to Johnson, 43, whom he cut across the left side of the face and also tried to behead. She survived. Nolen was eventually shot by the company's CEO Mark Vaughan but survived his wounds. The affidavit adds that he 'openly admitted to ""beheading"" the first victim with a knife and cutting and attempting to ""behead"" the second victim with the knife'. He faces two assault charges in relation to Johnson and Vaughan. Mashburn said it was 'highly likely' that he would seek the death penalty against Nolen, but would confer first with Hufford's family. While the FBI is investigating his links to Islam, and while he believed Nolen was using Arabic terms during the attack, Mashburn said the attack seemed to be tied more to the complaints against him. 'It had more to do with race rather than trying to convert people,' Mashburn said. He said there was a 'back and forth with Ms. Johnson and that led her to make a complaint to the HR department.' 'There was some sort of infatuation with beheadings. It seemed to be related to his interest in killing someone that way,' the prosecutor said. 'Other than that, it seemed to be related to his being suspended earlier in the day.' On Nolen's Facebook page, listed under the name Jah'Keem Yisrael, he posted photos of Osama bin Laden and Taliban fighters, along with posts condemning a variety of aspects of American life. Posts ranged from religious iconography to stock photography to even photos of supposed UFO activity. It also included a graphic photo of a beheading. Victims: Colleen Hufford, left, was killed in the attack, while Traci Johnson, right, was repeatedly stabbed . Convert: Nolen, who had recently converted to Islam, was 'infatuated' with beheadings, prosecutors said . Today the MailOnline visited the apartment where Nolen has been living alone for the past year. The rundown block called The Colonial Apartments is on the north side of Moore just a few miles from the Vaughan Foods factory. Neighbors said Nolen was ‘extremely quiet’ and rarely conversed with others in the low income neighborhood. Retired mechanic Fred Fletcher, 61, who lives underneath Nolen’s $450 a month rented unit, said the suspected killer ‘blanked’ him every time he said hello. ‘I tried to be friendly and said hi on at least three occasions, he didn’t even turn his head, he looked straight through me. ‘He moved in less than a year ago, but you never heard much from him, he went to work in his SUV and came home, he never had any visitors, he was a loner. A maintenance man at the block said Nolen behaved ‘oddly’ after he tried to enter his apartment to fix a broken air-conditioning unit. The man, who would only give his name as Dwayne, said Nolen refused to let him in unaccompanied as if he were 'hiding something'. Dwayne said: 'His air-con needed unclogging and he wouldn't let me have access, it felt like he was trying to hide something. He wouldn’t let me in without him being there. 'He wrote in the book in the manager’s office that it was because of ""religious reasons"", because he's a Muslim. 'I thought it was odd as I've done work in a lot of Muslim people’s homes and they have never had a problem. I got the impression he wanted his privacy.’ Dwayne said Nolen generally lived a solitary life and spent his time surfing the web on his laptop. Scene: The attack unfolded on Thursday at Vaughan Foods in Moore, from where Nolen had just been fired . He said Nolen’s apartment was ‘spotless’ when he was finally allowed access to do repairs. ‘He kept it very clean and tidy with everything in its place,’ said Dwayne. ‘The floors were clean, all the kitchen counter tops were clean, extremely neat, and he had cleaning products on top of the refrigerator. He asked you to take your shoes off before you entered. 'Alton didn’t own a TV, instead he had a mat on the floor where he would sit on his laptop. 'I didn’t see any Islamic pictures or material as you might expect, his walls were covered in peaceful photos of scenery, nothing radical. 'He even had flowers in a vase on the coffee table, it was a nice place.' Another neighbor Mildred Adair, 68, said Nolen was extremely friendly with her even helping her lift a heavy shopping cart up some steps and into her apartment. 'He was nice to me, he helped me with my shopping and on a few occasions,' the retiree said. 'I saw him at the laundry-mat and we spoke. He seemed nice, not someone capable of killing.' Nolen's family members have said that they were surprised to learn of his conversion and never spoke about Islam explicitly with them. 'I spoke to him once he was released, and when we spoke, there was nothing of the sort,' said Nolen's cousin, James Fulsom, from Fort Worth, Texas. 'I don't believe he was converted (to Islam) in prison.' As recently as February, Fulsom said that when he talked to Nolen there was no mention of his conversion. 'He was just talking about what he was going to start doing, how he was going to get his life on track, and was ready to be focused on his future,' Fulsom told the Associated Press. A spokesman for an Oklahoma City Islamic group said Nolen had attended services at a mosque where sermons were delivered condemning such attacks. 'In no way, shape or form did he represent Islam in this foolish act,' said Saad Mohammad, director of information for the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City. Good neighbor: While some residents living in the same apartment block as Nolen said he was 'odd', others said he was quiet, tidy and helpful . Heroic: Nolen's gruesome attack was stopped by CEO Mark Vaughan, pictured, who shot him with a rifle . He added that he remembers the suspect was 'a little weird'. 'He acted a little odd,' Mohammed said, though he added that Nolen's behavior never raised any 'red flags' since he began worshiping at one of the group's centers in May. Nolen's mother and sister posted a video message on Facebook over the weekend saying they were shocked and saddened by the allegations against him. 'My son was raised up in a loving home. My son was raised up believing in God,' his mother, Joyce Nolen, said in the video. 'Our hearts bleed right now because of what they're saying Alton has done.' Oklahoma prison records show Nolen was released from prison in March 2013 after serving two years of a six-year sentence on charges that included assaulting a police officer and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Nolen received no misconduct reports during his incarceration at five separate facilities, Department of Corrections spokesman Jerry Massie said. Nolen completed his probation in March of this year.","Alton Nolen, 30, was charged with the murder of Colleen Hufford on Tuesday and officials will likely pursue the death penalty, the District Attorney said .

It may be only be a public holiday in Victoria's capital city, but the entire country will be glued to a TV screen for three minutes at 3pm today to watch the spectacle that is the Melbourne Cup . 'The race that stops the nation' runs over a distance of 3,200 metres at Flemington race course and is the richest and most prestigious ‘two-mile’ handicap in the world . Set for a cracking Spring day of 29 degrees, Melbourne will come alive with excited racegoers putting on their best trackside outfits to soak in the atmosphere . But it's not just all about the first Tuesday in November - the city develops a festival fever from the Friday night before and people arrive from all over the country to transcend into Cup craziness. No time for people to put their feet up - Derby Day is on the Saturday before, when 90,000-odd people don their Saturday best and make the trek to Flemington racecourse. Sunday might not have a race on, but turn on a TV or radio or pick up a paper and it's wall-to-wall Cup coverage. And Monday, with just 24 hours to go, tens of thousands of people lined Swanston St for the annual Melbourne Cup parade. Melbourne was in a Cup frenzy on Monday for the parade before the race that stops the nation kicks off today . Race fans - and trainer Gai  Waterhouse (right) - enjoy the spectacle of the Melbourne Cup . The event becomes a real who's who of the celebrity world as the rich and famous quaff expensive champagne and dine on fresh caviar, trendy burgers and bespoke desserts in the famous birdcage at Flemington. Whispers have started that controversial couple, The Bachelor's Blake Garvey and Louise Pillidge, might make their first public appearance in the flesh. Celebrities will be on Rolling Stones alert at Lavazza, which is confirmed to be hosting Tyrone Woods, son of Ronnie Woods. The Stones might drop by, given they are scheduled to perform at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne the following day. There is talk Lara Bingle, rumoured to be pregnant to partner Sam Worthington, may swan into the birdcage to catch up with friend, fellow model Bambi Northwood-Blyth? Last Melbourne Cup Carnival, she broke the Victoria Racing Club dress code by flashing her midriff as she partied at the Lavazza marquee. Controversial businessman Geoffrey Edelsten, 71, is a regular Cup Day attendee, with his former wife Brynne Gordon always turning heads with her flamboyant racewear ensembles. This year, Edelsten will take new fiancee, 25-year-old American DJ Gabi Grecko, to the Emirates marquee. Sunrise co-host Samantha Armytage will also join the party at Emirates, as well as the woman she replaced on the Seven Network's breakfast program, Melissa Doyle. Rebecca Judd is also expected at Emirates with husband Chris Judd. Model and new mum Megan Gale will join Ashley Hart in the Swisse marquee, where Lleyton Hewitt and his wife Bec are also on the guest list. A conservative found the Melbourne Cup costs employers  $1.2 billion in lost productivity. Pictured are revellers at the end of Derby Day at Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne on Saturday . Crowds build up during race 6 at the Melbourne Cup at Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne in 2013 . Meanwhile, research by HR firm Randstad found that 77 percent of working Australians spend three and a half hours or more celebrating the Melbourne Cup. The survey found that 15 percent watch the race and participate in office sweepstakes before getting back to work, and just 8 percent are too busy to watch the race at all. The survey, taken in 2010 but adjusted to account for the Australian Bureau of Statistics' current size of the workforce and average hourly wage, found that a conservative estimate of the Melbourne Cups' cost to productivity  is $1.2 billion. Taking into account costs associated with employees taking Monday off, particularly in Victoria where Melbourne Cup Tuesday is a public holiday, and the loss of productivity over much of  Wednesday, the number would be much higher, Randstad's Mike Roddy said. Paul Dundon, managing director of workplace absence management firm Direct Health Solutions, said figures show the number of full-time employees who call in sick on the Wednesday following Melbourne Cup day jumps by 25 percent. With just over 8 million full-time workers in Australia, for employers that means an extra 80,000 people don't go to work at a cost of $24 million, Mr Dundon said. Randstad found 77 percent of working Australians spend three and a half hours or more celebrating the  Cup . This is based on the absenteeism rate jumping from the daily average of 4 percent to 5 percent, and the cost of a sick day costing employers $300. Mr Roddy said the majority of Australian workers expect to engage in Melbourne Cup festivities at work. 'From lunchtime onwards tomorrow you only have to look in any foyer of any workplace and fascinators will be filling the room with people going to lunches or getting on the bus to go to the races,' Mr Roddy said. 'There are various lunches and functions in the office and it's almost like a graveyard shift between two and five o'clock.' But Mr Roddy said bosses should take advantage of the benefits of organising a Melbourne Cup event, as it could motivate employees to work longer or harder later down the track. Father and son jockey Glyn (right) and Chad Schofield at the parade before the Tuesday's big race . Race fans young and old get into the Cup spirit during the official parade on Monday . Almost 14 million Australians will spend $400 million betting on the Melbourne Cup tomorrow . 'If you weren't to allow people to celebrate you could be perceived as draconian,' he said. 'It's an opportunity to use this as a tool for having bit of fun and connecting with your people.' The race also puts a drain on Australians' purse strings thanks to increase in people gambling, buying new outfits for Melbourne Cup functions and the jump in spending at pubs, clubs and restaurants around the country. But this spike in spending injects millions into the retail, hospitality and tourism sectors of the economy, particularly in Victoria. Almost 14 million Australians will spend $400 million betting on the Melbourne Cup tomorrow, or an average of $29 each, according to insurance firm Asteron Life. Last year the Melbourne Cup Carnival injected $177.5 million into Victoria's gross state product . Last year IBISWorld estimated that Melbourne Cup boosts spending on food and alcohol by $167.9 million thanks to the number of events at workplaces, bars, clubs, restaurants and private homes. And a study undertaken on behalf of Victoria Racing Club found that last year the Melbourne Cup Carnival injected $177.5 million into Victoria's gross state product. More than 48,000 visitors travelled to Victoria specifically for Melbourne Cup, spending $25.6 million on accommodation. Retail spending for the Cup hit $53.1 million in Victoria alone, with race enthusiasts buying more than 62,000 hats and fascinators, 60,000 pairs of shoes, 50,000 dresses, 30,000 items of jewellery, 27,000 ties, 21,000 handbags, 18,000 suits, 17,000 items of underwear, 14,000 shirts, 11,000 pairs of sunglasses and 13,000 pairs of socks and pantihose.

"Most drinkers call it a night when they've run out of cigarettes. But not wine connoisseurs, who carry on drinking regardless, it seems. A new study has found that making cigarettes more expensive and banning smoking indoors means people drink less beer and spirits – but not wine. Smoking laws which made cigarettes more expensive and banned smoking in public places meant people drank less beer and spirits - but not wine . Researchers found that when the price of tobacco rose by 20 per cent - and smoking was forbidden in public places - the amount of beer and spirits consumed fell. But banning smoking had no effect on the amount of wine people knocked back. As part of the new study, researchers analysed the price of cigarettes from 1980 to 2009 in each state in the U.S. and the 'smoke free air' policies which might have banned smoking indoors. They also looked at how much beer, wine and spirits were drunk per person in each U.S. state. The figures showed beer consumption fell by four per cent and spirit drinking by 11 per cent when these two measures to try and prevent people from smoking so much were introduced. Study co-author, Melissa Krauss, of Washington University School of Medicine, said: 'In situations when smokers are drinking alcohol, it tends to trigger cravings for a cigarette. 'Some people even tend to smoke only when they drink, but not at any other time.' She added that these results were across the whole population, whereas if they looked just at smokers then it is likely they would see even more of a reduction in the amount of beer and spirits people drank. In the short term, those who want to cut down on their drinking could achieve this by smoking less,  she said. The reason why there was no noticeable decrease among wine drinkers may be because they are more educated, more likely to have other healthier lifestyle habits - and are less likely to smoke, the researchers explained. Richard A. Grucza, associate professor of psychiatry at the university, said raising taxes on cigarettes could be explored as a way of reducing the amount of alcohol drunk. 'Excluding tobacco, alcohol is by far the deadliest drug in the U.S.,' he added. People prefer wine are more educated, more likely to have other healthier lifestyle habits - and are less likely to smoke, researchers claim . 'Raising taxes on alcohol would go a long way toward reducing excessive alcohol consumption, but there has been a lot of resistance to doing this. 'Our study shows that strengthening tobacco-control policies might be another way to accomplish this. 'By raising cigarette taxes and strengthening clean indoor air laws, states may not only reduce health detriments related to smoking, but also those related to drinking.' The researchers say the findings could spark further studies on whether restrictions on cigarettes could reduce alcohol-related violence, drunk driving, and health problems and even deaths related to alcohol. The study was published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research. It follows research which found that fewer people smoked in states with tighter smoking regulations.","U.S. laws introduced higher taxes on cigarettes and banned indoor smoking .

"A brutal murderer sent smirking selfies from his prison cell to several woman just weeks after marrying his childhood sweetheart. Jamie Bain, 30, was sentenced to life with a minimum of 22 years after he gunned down former boxing champion Alex McKinnon at the Marmion pub in Edinburgh in 2006. The killer sent pictures of himself next to a rack of expensive trainers while enjoying home comforts like television and a music system inside his cell at Shotts prison in Lanarkshire. Jamie Bain, 30, took the selfies inside Shotts prison in Lanarkshire where he is serving time for the murder of former boxing champion Alex McKinnon who he gunned down at the Marmion pub in Edinburgh in 2006 . One woman, who received the pictures and asked not to be named, said she was surprised to see how 'happy and relaxed' Bain looked. She said: 'He doesn't seem that bothered about his jail term. He looks like he's done his cell up with posters and flags so it all looks nice and home-like. I don't think it's fair on the victim's family to see him like that.' Bain, known as the 'baby-faced assassin', is pictured lounging on a chair, wearing a Celtic top in one of the images. In another, he sits cross-legged, smirking in a pair of blue shorts and flip-flops. He and long-time fiancee Dionne Hendry married in a jail service conducted by Christopher Taylor, a priest at St Andrew's Church, Airdrie, in July. But tying the knot has not stopped the shotgun killer from contacting other women from behind bars, it has been claimed. Bain married his long-term fiancee in prison in July but continued to send the photographs - where he poses beside expensive trainers, a television and a music system - to a string of different women . One source said: 'I think he talks to loads of girls even though he's just got married. He has a phone and goes on Facebook, he uses loads of different names so they don't know it's him but his friends know who he is. 'They seem to always get phones in there - every time they're caught with one, they seem to get another.' Bain was sent to jail in 2006 after he burst into the Edinburgh pub and produced a double-barrelled sawn-off shotgun concealed down his trouser leg. He was wearing an ice hockey mask when he shot Mr McKinnon's brother-in-law James Hendry before firing at the 32-year-old former boxer as he turned to flee. Bain, who was 22 at the time of the murder - has reportedly been in trouble with the authorities for his mobile phone use in prison. Officers stand outside Shotts prison in Lanarkshire where Bain is currently held behind bars. Despite being inside the maximum security prison he still appears to have been able to smug a mobile phone into his cell . Last year The Daily Record revealed he had been caught with a £200 Blackberry smartphone when guards at Saughton jail in Edinburgh opened his cell door and found him in the middle of a call. Two years before that it emerged that along with his accomplices, Richard Cosgrove and Ben Young, they had been updating their Facebook pages while inside three different prisons. A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said he could not comment on individual prisoners. He added: 'Possession of a mobile phone in prison is a criminal offence and we have measures in place to tackle this problem.' According to the Prisons (Interference with Wireless Telegraphy) Act 2012 it is a disciplinary offence to possess a mobile phone within a prison and smuggling a phone inside can carry a sentence of up to two years in prison and an unlimited fine.","Jamie Bain, 30, sent pictures from his cell in Shotts prison in Lanarkshire .

"The European Commission may make the unprecedented move of rejecting France's 2015 budget and make it draw up a new one that better addresses the country's deficit problems. It would be the first time the EU executive exercises its power to demand changes to a national budget draft under new prerogatives that EU countries granted the Commission in 2013. The Commission is also likely to step up the disciplinary procedure against France to the final stage before fines while at the same time granting Paris the extra two years it wants to bring down its budget shortfall within EU limits. In the driving seat?Socialist President Francois Hollande's approval rating is at an all-time low of 13 percent in some opinion polls due to public anger over unemployment, economic stagnation, public spending curbs and resistance to structural reforms . However, the French government today said it was confident its budget bill would go through and that to speculate over whether it would be accepted would be premature. 'We are not working on that basis,' an official of president Francois Hollande's office told Reuters. The decisions, some of which will be taken by the outgoing Commission before a new team led by Jean-Claude Juncker takes office in November, would give France more time while upholding the credibility of the recently toughened EU budget rules, one euro zone official with insight into the process said. Such a solution would also help the designated Commissioner in charge of policing budgets, France's Pierre Moscovici, to prove he will not give preferential treatment to his country, as many centre-right members of the European Parliament suspect. Moscovici was ordered to submit written replies by Tuesday to detailed questions on how much flexibility he would give to countries that repeatedly breach EU fiscal rules after lawmakers found his answers at a hearing last week evasive. First time: It would be the first time the EU executive exercises its power to demand changes to a national budget draft under new prerogatives that EU countries granted the Commission in 2013 . 'It would save face for everybody,' the official said of the proposed Commission action. 'Even if it would be a bit humiliating for France, they probably know they cannot get away without anything. 'And it would also save face for Germany and the others, who are concerned about the longer-term effects, about not watering down the rules, but who also want to give France and its unpopular president a fighting chance,' the official said. Socialist President Francois Hollande's approval rating is at an all-time low of 13 percent in some opinion polls due to public anger over unemployment, economic stagnation, public spending curbs and resistance to structural reforms. Trouble: France was supposed to have brought its budget deficit below the EU ceiling of 3 percent of GDP last year, but in June 2013 EU finance ministers gave it a two-year extension, until 2015, because of a recession in the euro zone . Germany, one of the strongest advocates of budget discipline in the euro zone, has been reticent in criticising France since the announcement that Paris would not honour its commitmets. 'Its about the big political picture in France, in the end. That's why Germnay is so reticent. In Berlin they already have a strong picture where Marine Le Pen is the next French presient,' the euro zone official said, referring to the leader of the extreme-right National Front, who leads the field in some polls ahead of the 2017 presidential election. 'You don't kick someone who is already down,' the official said, adding the position would have been different had Hollande's ratings been high. France was supposed to have brought its budget deficit below the EU ceiling of 3 percent of GDP last year, but in June 2013 EU finance ministers gave it a two-year extension, until 2015, because of a recession in the euro zone. On Sept. 10, Paris announced it would not meet the 2015 deadline either and the deficit would only fall below 3 percent in 2017. Last Wednesday it published a 2015 budget draft that falls well short of the consolidation efforts sought by EU finance ministers in 2013. While France blames weak economic growth, EU officials point out that it has not even met the goals to reduce its structural deficit -- stripped of the effects of the business cycle -- and so has not taken effective action to meet its obligations. France will officially submit that budget draft to the Commission for scrutiny on Oct. 15 and the EU executive has two weeks to send it back for changes if it determines that the plan breaches earlier agreements. 'If the Commission finds that France, miraculously, did what was required in structural terms, then there will be an extension of the deadline,' a second euro zone official said. 'If the structural adjustment is not there, the procedure will have to be stepped up,' the official said. France was to cut its structural deficit by 0.8 percent of GDP in 2014 and the same in 2015. The budget draft however, foresees an improvement in the structural deficit of only 0.1 and 0.2 percent respectively.","Would be 1st time EU demands changes to a national budget draft .

"A 31-year-old Texas woman has been arrested for allegedly breaking into the home of a male friend of her husbands, before climbing into his bed and sexually assaulting him. Megan Davis Hoelting has been charged with burglarizing following the alleged incident on Monday night. It is the fourth time she has been arrested this month. According to a court record obtained by The Smoking Gun, she entered the victim's house in Williamson County, north of Austin, through an unlocked gate. Hoelting is said to have been wearing her nightgown at the time, but took it off once inside.

"An army of green-fanged cannibal spiders is invading Britain - gobbling up smaller arachnids as they set up nests in homes across the country. The eight-legged creatures are believed to be tube spiders - one of the largest types in the UK - and their bite is like a bee sting. Their thick black bodies range from between 1.5cm to 2.2cm wide, their fangs shine menacingly green, and they are known to eat their own mothers. Blink, and you'd miss it - but this hungry tube web spider makes light work of wolfing down its prey as it leaps from its lair and devours another arachnid in Wales. Mike Rance first spotted the eight-legged beast when he was outside his friend's house in Newport, South Wales, and neighbours pointed out clusters all down the street. Scroll down for video . An army of green-fanged cannibal spiders is invading Britain - gobbling up smaller arachnids as they set up nests in homes across the country.  The eight-legged creatures are believed to be tube spiders . He decided to capture the moment the spider popped out for lunch on camera after first testing out the arachnid's appetite. To his surprise, he found that the creature was a particularly fussy eater. Mr Rance, 41 from Cwmbran, said: 'I spotted this one on the wall and shined a light on to it and could see its fangs. 'It was devouring another smaller spider – they're proper little cannibals. 'We tried to feed it a woodlouse but it wasn't interested. 'We then tried a normal sized spider but it didn't want to know. 'They only seemed to want to eat smaller ones, I guess they must be easier prey.' After capturing one spider, he passed it on to a vet friend with a special interest in spiders as she owns 32 tarantulas herself. She confirmed that they are in fact tube spiders, whose painful bites can last for up to six hours. He said: 'There were about seven on the back of my mate's house when we first looked. 'One of the neighbours came out and asked if we were looking at the spiders and showed us a cluster of about 30 or 40 in his back garden then showed us one of a similar size in the front yard.' 'He then pointed out houses all over the street that said they had them – they're all over the place. Dozens of cannibalistic fanged spiders have invaded a street in South Wales. The eight-legged insects are believed to be tube spiders - one of the largest types in the UK - and their bite is like a bee sting . Their thick black bodies range from between 1.5cm to 2.2cm wide and their fangs shine menacingly green . 'They're quite amazing to watch.' Both sexes of tube spiders look similar and live on walls, fences, and the bark of trees. Originally from southern Europe, adults can be found from June to November and create a tube-shaped web with trip-lines radiating out. Tube-web spiders are one of the largest spiders in Europe and are nocturnal hunters that prey on cockroaches, moths, bees and wasps. They sow distinctive tube-shaped webs in cracks and holes and wait by the entrance for prey to touch the strands. They first entered the UK 150 years ago from continental Europe, arriving on ships docking in ports. The females tend to be larger than males and can reach a body length of up to 22mm. One of the tube web spiders that have invaded the outside walls and garden of Mr Jackson's home . Segestria florentina is the largest European spider found and the bodies of females can reach lengths of 22mm. Originally from the Mediterranean, they can be found as far east as Georgia but are also commonly spotted in Britain - particularly in the later half of the year. They have a black or dark brown body, often with a green shine on their fangs. While their bite has no long lasting effects, it is described as feeling similar to a bee sting or injection and the pain can last for several hours. They are also known as a tube web spider or cellar spider because they create a web in a crack or gap and wait for prey to step into it. Sightings of the spider in Britain have in the past been confused with the deadly Australian funnel web spider as the two species use a similar hunting technique.","Hungry tube web spider makes light work of gobbling up much smaller prey .

"An exhilarating stunt video has now become a tribute to a renowned international pilot . Daring dirt bike rider Nick De Wit performs an outrageous and perfectly judged backflip over an aircraft in a memorable stunt. Under Over was a stunt which was completed by biker Nick De Wit and pilot Glen Dell from a remote airstrip in the North West bushveld of South Africa. Flying low: Pilot Glen takes off in preparation for the memorable stunt . The memorable stunt after was the culmination of two years of detailed planning when it was filmed in September 2013. Mr De Wit and Mr Dell are seen in the video discussing the various elements of the stunt as they prepare to attempt the dangerous trick. Timing: Mr Dell had to perfectly judge his timing as he prepared to fly under the ramp . Airborne: Bike rider Nick De Wit takes flight after he builds up speed on the bike ramp . The biker speeds up a ramp while the aircraft is being flown at a low height and then he flips backwards with incredible speed and precision to lift himself over the plane. Moments later the South African duo are seen happily congratulating each other and giving each other a high-five after they successfully complete the manoeuvre. Sadly Mr Dell, who won eight South African titles and claimed the Advanced World Aerobatic Champion in 2004, died tragically five weeks later on October 12, 2013. The experienced pilot had an aviation legacy that spanned 30 years with 25,000 hours of flying experience in over 250 types of aircraft when he was fatally injured at a Secunda airshow.

"A father-of-five is accusing officials of negligence after he suffered serious burn injuries when a stray firework exploded on his leg and scorched holes in his tracksuits bottoms. Jason Deeley-Brewer, 43, had his three-year-old daughter on his shoulders when the rocket hit him at a council display on Wednesday. He was one of four people injured when the rocket shot through safety barriers at Brunswick Park, in Wednesbury, West Midlands. Mr Deeley-Brewer, who managed to stay on his feet but was later taken to hospital for treatment, has said he will now take action against Sandwell Council, who held the event, for failing to protect the public. Jason Deeley-Brewer holding his tracksuit bottoms which were scorched by a stray firework on Bonfire Night . He said: 'We stopped at the Brunswick Park main gates and I saw a big group of people ahead at the skate park, so I picked up my daughter and put her on my shoulders. 'As I did, a stray firework came over the top of us and exploded on empty land nearby, then another firework hit my leg, exploding and burning through my trousers. 'There was a huge bang and a flash of green light - I managed to stay on my feet with my child on my shoulders, but saw a lad nearby fall to the ground and pass out. Shockingly, a St John's Ambulance employee said he did not need to go to hospital when he looked at his swollen leg and instead told him to go home with his daughter Lilly-Rose and partner Angela Walters. Mr Deeley-Brewer added: 'But when I got home my partner looked at it and said my leg was burnt with cuts and bruising. 'I went to hospital and they treated the burns before wrapping the leg up in dressing. 'I was lucky I picked up my daughter when I did, or she might have been hurt. Mr Deeley-Brewer said he is to receive treatment for his burns, cuts and bruises to both his legs for the foreseeable future . Mr Deeley-Brewer's daughter was on his shoulders when the stray rocket his. Pictured, his tracksuit bottoms . 'The whole thing has made me reluctant to attend another firework display unless I'm absolutely sure my family and I are safe. 'The scary part for me was that I was with my daughter, and she could have been hurt, not me. 'We had planned to buy some fireworks for ourselves, but this has all put me off. I'd rather stay safe with my family.' Mr Deeley-Brewer, who works as a driver, said he is to receive treatment for his burns, cuts and bruises to both his legs for the foreseeable future. 'The firework hit me on the back of both my legs. It exploded through my tracksuit bottoms. 'There are severe burns to my legs, my left leg in particular. 'I have been for treatment three times at hospital since already. I have got to carrying on going back. 'I am not sure how long exactly my treatment will need to last but it will be for some time yet.' Labour councillor Elaine Costigan, of Sandwell Council, said: 'Lessons will be learnt.' But Mr Deeley-Brewer, who is still receiving treatment for his burns from a doctor, has already contacted solicitors to begin the process of a claim against the local authority. He claims the event was poorly organised and failed to protect the crowd of about 12,000 people. The event, organised by Sandwell Council, was held in Brunswick Park and attracted a crowd of thousands . A 23-year-old man suffered an ear injury and a seven-year-old girl and a 47-year-old man suffered minor leg injuries as a result of the stray firework. In a statement on its Twitter feed, Sandwell Council said four people were thought to have been treated by medical staff after the incident. The local authority said: 'This is the first incident of its kind we have had in many years of putting on community fireworks displays. 'Our thoughts are with the people injured and their families. We will be conducting a thorough investigation into what happened.'","Jason Deeley-Brewer, 43, had daughter on his shoulders when the rocket hit .

"Contents of a getaway car driven by the man suspected of kidnapping college student Hannah Graham have been revealed as police faced criticism this week over their handling of the case. Jesse Matthew has been charged with abduction with intent to defile following Miss Graham's disappearance on September 13 from the Downtown Mall in Charlottesville, Virginia. Matthew fled to Texas while he was a 'person of interest' last month but was later found by police camping on a Galveston beach and arrested. The contents of the fugitive's Nissan Sentra were revealed by police on Tuesday and included an ashtray overflowing with cigarette butts, a Charlottesville detective's business card, a cassette tape with Jesus written on the front and an envelope containing a cross. Scroll down for video . Jesse Matthew took his sister's Nissan Sentra (pictured) and fled to Texas last month after he was named a person of interest in the abduction of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham . The contents of Jesse Matthew's getaway car were revealed by police this week. Photos showed an overflowing ashtray . Police also discovered an envelope in the kidnapping suspect's car which contained a cross and the words: 'Open this envelope first before you read my letter. Enclosed: 3 Powerful Faith tools to release God's power' Jesse Mattew's car revealed details about his journey from Virginia to Texas and included a cassette tape with the word Jesus on the front and a Charlottesville detective's card . The yellow envelope had the words: 'Open this envelope first before you read my letter. Enclosed: 3 Powerful Faith tools to release God's power.' No evidence of Miss Graham was found in the vehicle, police said. Matthew is now in custody in Virginia. Matthew was scheduled to appear in court this Thursday on the abduction charge and reckless driving charges. The cases were postponed until December. Matthew took the car from his sister and fled Virginia on September 21 after walking into the Charlottesville police station with family members and asking to speak to a detective. Police were still trying to fill in gaps in the timeline from the night that Jesse Matthew was last seen on surveillance footage with University of Virginia student Hannah Graham at 1.40am in the downtown area. At a briefing earlier on Monday, investigators asked people who knew Matthew, a former college football lineman and sometime cab driver, to come forward with information so that they can develop a better profile of him. This week, dozens of people continued to scour hundreds of square miles in Albemarle County, through woodland and heavy brush, for the missing 18-year-old sophomore. For the first time ever in Virginia, an aerial drone was being used to search for the missing teen. Hannah Graham, 18, (left) disappeared on September 13 after being last seen in downtown Charlottesville with nurse's assistant Jesse Matthew (right). Rescuers continue to search for the student . Charlottesville's police chief said on Monday that it's important not to rush the case against Matthew, despite coming under fire for some of his decisions. Chief Timothy Longo said on Monday that new information meant investigators believe Graham is in Virginia which has stopped them widening their search beyond state lines. Asked whether he expects to find Miss Graham alive, Chief Longo said: 'Every day that passes is not a good sign. Every day that passes translates more to recovery than rescue. But at the end of the day, we still have to find Hannah Graham.' He added that he thinks about the case constantly. 'I lay in bed at night going over what have we done differently, what could we do differently?' he said. Matthew was arrested last month after fleeing the state of Virginia. He was found camping on a beach in Galveston, Texas. Pictured above on September 26, being escorted by FBI off a plane back in Virginia . Charlottesville police chief Timothy Longo, pictured at a press conference last month, has come under fire for his handling of the investigation into missing student Hannah Graham . The Charlottesville police department has come under fire for allowing Matthew to flee the station after he arrived last month to talk to detectives and asked for a lawyer. Matthew's apartment had just been searched and while not a suspect at the time, he was considered a 'person of interest.' He left the police without being charged and sped away, prompting police to issue an arrest warrant for reckless driving, authorities said. While Matthew was a fugitive, Virginia police added a charge of abduction with intent to defile in Miss Graham's disappearance, and he was arrested several days later on a Texas beach. 'We caught some criticism when Mr. Matthew walked out that door on that Saturday afternoon. People couldn't understand: ""How do you just let the guy walk out the door?''' Chief  Longo said on Monday. 'We made a commitment to honor certain constitutional protections that people have in our criminal justice system, and as frustrating as it is, we want to be very careful to get it right, not to rush to judgment.' Chief Longo said the goal of asking for more information about Matthew was to try to figure out areas he may have been familiar with as they assess where to focus their search. 'What are the places where he's most comfortable? ... If you were to take someone against their will, you're going to take them to someplace likely where you're comfortable. You're not going to go out in the dark and hope for the best,' the chief said. Authorities said that forensic evidence connects Matthew to the 2009 slaying of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student. Chief Longo declined to discuss the evidence against Matthew or whether he might be charged in the Harrington case.","Jesse Matthew was charged with abduction  following Miss Graham's disappearance on September 13  in Charlottesville, Virginia .

"Parents were left in a flap when they spotted this bizarre coloured chicken on the loose outside a school. The feathered bird, which has a distinctive pink hue, was pictured running around in Nottingham earlier this month. The picture was posted on the Bramcote Animal Rescue Facebook page, in a bid to find out more information about the brightly coloured bird. The pink-coloured bird was spotted on the loose in Nottingham, leading to numerous theories on Facebook . More than 20 people commented, speculating where the chicken may have come from. Lotus Shephard wrote: '[Is it a] chicken wearing make-up?' But Susanna Zabulis thought it looked more like 'a small bald turkey'. Julia Street added: 'I'd guess someone did a spray job on it.' Claire Everard suggested someone may have sprayed the bird with an anti-pecking spray. Another added: 'It looks like it's had a tandoori marinade already but must have jumped out the pot.' But Glenn Mills, who says he is a farmer, identified it as a 'dishevelled' Rhode Island Red hen - an American breed of chicken.

An RSPCA spokesman said: 'It isn't clear what type of chicken it is, despite the markings on the feathers. 'It is difficult to say from the photograph, which is taken at some distance. If it is dyed then this is potentially a cruel and unnecessary thing to do to an animal. 'Dyeing or painting a bird could cause allergic reactions and compromise the animals’ ability to communicate with other animals of their own and other species and make them more vulnerable to predators.'","Feathered bird with a distinctive pink hue was spotted in Nottingham .

"Jailed: Gary Gilleney, of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, first abused a little girl in London in 1985 before going on to molest two more girls in the 1990s . A former soldier let off with just a £100 fine after sexually abusing a child in the 1980s has been jailed for preying on other 'highly vulnerable' children in the 1990s. Gary Gilleney, of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, first abused a little girl in London in 1985. But under a sentencing regime dating back to the 1950s, he was only convicted of indecent assault and gross indecency and ordered to pay just £100. The ex-serviceman was dishonourably discharged from the Army as a result of the conviction and went on to abuse two more 'highly vulnerable' children when he was living in council estates in Manchester the 1990s. Now Gilleney has been jailed for six years after admitting six sexual assaults against the two later victims, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. He was arrested after the offences came to light last year. One of the newly-discovered victims was just seven when she was abused by Gilleney, Manchester Crown Court heard. In a statement, she told the court that the ordeal made her feel like she 'never had a proper childhood'. She added: 'He used to threaten me that if I ever reported the abuse and he went down, he would come and get me after he was released. 'As a child I believed it and I was frightened. I couldn't sleep at nights. I have no self-esteem. 'It's affected my relationships since becoming an adult. I'm shy of my own body and suffer from flashbacks.' The other victim, who came forward last year, was 13 when he plied her with cannabis and sexually abused her. One of Gilleney's abuse victims told Manchester Crown Court (above) that she 'doesn't trust anyone any more' and has been 'depressed for years' In a statement she said she 'doesn't trust anyone any more' and has been 'depressed for years'. Both women described crying themselves to sleep in the aftermath of their traumatic experiences with Gilleney. Gilleney's defence barrister said he had been 'damaged' by his own childhood. He told the court: 'He is genuinely confused and remorseful about what he has done. 'It's not a remorse that comes in floods of tears, but there will follow, one hopes, a period of reflection and introspection. 'This is an unsophisticated person, prone to urges he neither understands nor can control. 'It may be easy to suggest he is simply an evil man and it may be there's some truth in that, but it's more complex than that.' Judge Martin Rudland, sentencing, told Gilleney: 'You corrupted your victims' formative years.'","Gary Gilleney, of Rochdale, first molested a young girl in 1985 .

"The Bard: Myths and doubts surround William Shakespeare . Dame Janet Suzman has hit out at two acclaimed Shakespearean actors who believe the Bard was not the true author of the plays. The actress said it was 'strange' that Sir Derek Jacobi and Mark Rylance took the 'haughty' view that they were penned by an English aristocrat. She said it was 'snobbish' to believe that the writer could not have been a playwright from Stratford Upon Avon. Jacobi claimed the dramas were written by Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, who hid behind William Shakespeare because, he said, a nobleman could not be seen as a common playwright. While Rylance, currently performing in Richard III at the Globe, has pointed out that details about Italy in the plays are 'exact' and the Earl had widely toured the country. Suzman, who has starred and directed in many Shakespeare dramas, said she got 'mad as a snake' over the myths and doubts about the man regarded as the world's greatest poet and playwright. She told the Observer: 'It annoyed me… I suddenly felt like Joan of Arc riding into battle.' She described last year's film Anonymous, which portrayed . Shakespeare as a drunken fool and the Earl as a literary genius, as 'far-fetched' and a waste of money. In her new book, Not Hamlet, Suzman devotes a chapter to 'conspiracy theories' surrounding Shakespeare who died at the age of 52 in 1616 after writing 37 plays, 154 sonnets and poems. She wrote: 'You have to be a . conspiracy theorist to imagine the earl secretly wrote 37 plays, . performed and printed over a quarter of a century, without being found . out. Bard defender: Janet Suzman claims Jacobi and Rylance had a 'haughty' view of the playwright . Acclaimed: Mark Rylance in Shakespeare's  drama Measure For Measure and award-winning Derek Jacobi . 'And you have to be a . snob if you just hate it that the greatest poet the world has produced . was born into the humble aldermanic classes of a provincial town.' She . added: 'How strange it is that Jacobi and Rylance, hundreds of years . later, with their outstanding acting instincts, should embrace such a . haughty view of the man who has made them as big as they are. 'We have seen a dozen times how thrillingly they themselves can conjure up fantastical character studies of fictional persons – without ever having been crowned king or murdered a rival in real life. 'It's what actors do for heaven's sakes, and Shakespeare was one too. It's called imagination.' Star: Jacobi in BBC's Shakespeare's  Richard II with Janet Maw as his queen . Doubts have surrounded Shakespeare's authorship for 150 years, with Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe and Edward de Vere  named as the likely writers of his sonnets and plays. Last June, Jacobi said that Shakespeare was just a 'frontman' for the Earl of Oxford. He said: 'The simple fact is the earl could not be seen as a common playwright. He was living in a Stasi-type London.' Rylance, said the 'big thing' in the Earl's favour was his wide knowledge of Italy where 14 of of bard's plays are set. He said: 'You would expect a playwright who set 14 of 37 plays in Italy to have been there, and the knowledge is exact.' A spokesman for Rylance said he did not only promote the “Oxfordian” theory while Jacobi was unavailable for comment.","'I got mad as a snake about the conspiracy theorists,' she says .

"BP wanted its money back - hundreds of millions of dollars of it - but a federal judge said Wednesday that the oil giant must stick by its agreement with the companies it compensated for business losses due to the 2010 Gulf oil spill. BP argued that a flawed funding formula in their settlement with alleged victims of the spill enabled many businesses to collect on questionable claims, and that they should be forced to return the money. Fraudulent? BP argued that a flawed funding formula enabled many to collect on questionable claims -- and that they should be forced to return the money . U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier agreed several weeks ago to change the formula for any future payments, but he ruled Wednesday that a deal is a deal when it comes to the money BP has already paid out. Under that deal, claimants agreed not to sue the oil company, and BP company agreed that no future court action could change their payments. The ruling thwarts BP's latest attempt to control its soaring liability from the spill, which may be nearing $50 billion. Barbier said he would rule later on the issue of compensation for cleanup workers whose chronic medical problems weren't diagnosed until after the deal's cutoff date of April 16, 2012. The settlement entitled cleanup workers with chronic conditions including rashes and breathing problems to receive up to $60,700 if the problems first surfaced within days of their cleanup work. Messy: A judge ruled that businesses do not have to pay back BP the money. The ruling thwarts the company's latest attempt to control its soaring liability from the 2010 spill (file photo) Barbier ruled in July that, as BP contends, those payments can only go to people diagnosed before that date, and any plaintiffs diagnosed later must prove in court that their illness was linked to their spill work. Plaintiffs' attorneys asked him to change his mind, arguing that the cutoff date would keep most of the affected workers from collecting. Many of these workers couldn't afford to pay doctors right away, and neither patients nor doctors knew what medical tests were required before the settlement was signed, they argued. The plaintiffs' attorneys said the cutoff date was meant for people with 'diseases, like cancers, that would likely take years to manifest.' BP is still facing a financial nightmare from the nation's worst oil disaster, which began with an explosion that tore open the oil company's Macondo well on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico, destroying the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and killing 11 workers. Just as the company struggled to contain the spill over the following weeks and months, it's now trying to contain its estimated liability. The London-based company told shareholders at one point that its total exposure would be $40 billion, and markets responded accordingly. The estimate is now close to $50 billion, including more than $27 billion that BP says it has already paid to settle damage claims, and the company's stock price has suffered. The Macondo explosion fouled fruitful seafood grounds, sensitive coastal marshes and tourist-friendly beaches. The claims settlement reached with a committee of attorneys for various plaintiffs in 2012 had no cap, and its cost continues to rise.

"A number of online anarchist groups have emerged, threatening to hold violent protests before and during next month's G20 summit in Brisbane.

A shattered glass-plate window cascades down as violent anti G20 protesters loot stores in Toronto. Police have planned a 24 hour special court in Brisbane to handle potential mass arrests from the protests . The court, which will open on November 10, mirrors the approach of Toronto police during the 2010 summit, when 1100 people were arrested and dealt with in a specialised court. One group, calling itself Plan B, says it opposes the G20 group of nations, who will meet on November 15-16 at Brisbane's Convention and Exhibition Centre. Anonymous anarchists have posted on their website: 'We are encouraging individuals and groups to take action which they see as effective and necessary given their circumstances. We do not see property destruction as an inherently violent act.' In a separate post, they wrote: 'While the p**s are helplessly patrolling the streets of Brisbane's CBD in their ridiculous armour with their intimidating vehicles, decentralised waves of creation and destruction will ebb and flow right across the country.' Other groups such as the Autonomous Action Radio, which broadcasts a weekly community radio show, has created posters which are on display across Brisbane depicting balaclava-clad protesters throwing objects and toppling over bins.

In addition to local factions, there are concerns that notorious international groups such as Black Bloc, thought to be responsible for the riot in the 2010 G20 summit in Toronto, are attempting to mobilise in Brisbane. Associate Professor Janet Ransley, who heads Griffith University's School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, told Brisbane Times  'I think it would be naive to think that Black Bloc and some of those groups are not mobilising. 'I know there has been some chatter on social media about them trying to get a presence in Brisbane.' Ms Ransley said. Assistant Commissioner Katarina Carroll, who is responsible for the Queensland police's response to the G20 protests, says they will keep a close eye on all the groups involved. 'Our top priority at all times is to ensure that members of the Queensland community are safe.

"A Silicon Valley technology firm flew eight workers 9,000 miles from Bangalore, India to California to install some computers and continued to pay them in rupees. The eight workers were employed to move computers for Electronics for Imaging Inc from their old headquarters in Foster City to their new building in California. During the three-month contract, the workers were paid the equivalent of $1.21-an-hour for a 120-hour week. Electronics for Imaging flew eight Indian workers almost 9,000 miles from Bangalore and paid them in rupees while working on a project to install computers in the company's new headquarters in Freemont, California . US department of Labor assistant district director Michael Eastwood described the situation in Electronics for Imaging, pictured,  as 'worse than anything that I ever saw in any of those Los Angeles sweatshops' The US Department of Labor found that the men worked a maximum of 122 hours in a week without receiving any overtime. The firm was ordered to pay more than $43,000 in back wages and penalties after the investigation. Electronics for Imaging is a printing technology specialist which had a turnover of $728 million last year. According to the Department of Labor, the company was paying its workers far below the $8 per hour minimum wage applicable in California at the time. The company said it 'unintentionally overlooked' US laws requiring foreign workers to be paid at least the minimum wage and overtime if they worked in excess of 40 hours in a week. Instead, the company gave the Indians unspecified bonuses while paying the transferred workers the same wages they normally received in their normal jobs in Bangalore, India. The workers were even paid in rupees while in the US . Michael Eastwood, a Department of Labor assistant district director, said the abuses at Electronics for Imaging were among the most outrageous he had ever seen - even worse than problems he had seen at garment factories in southern California. He said: 'This is worse than anything that I ever saw in any of those Los Angeles sweatshops.' Although it is not among Silicon Valley's high-profile companies, Electronics for Imaging is successful. The company earned $109 million last year and awarded CEO Guy Gecht with a pay package valued at nearly $6 million, including more than $1.2 million in salary and bonuses.

"Aaron Hernandez smiled and laughed with his attorneys in court this afternoon just feet away from the crying mother of the victim as a judge ruled the trial will ignore bullets found in his apartment. The former New England Patriot has denied shooting to death semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of his fiancee. And today his defense team was awarded a small success as a judge agreed to ignore the bullets found in Hernandez's rented apartment, which police claimed was the same caliber as the gun that killed Lloyd, because they had not provided a reason for a search warrant. Waiting for the news, the 24-year-old did not seem worried as his team persisted with their arguments, and Mr Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, sat in the public gallery weeping. Relaxed: Aaron Hernandez smiled on the third day of his evidentiary hearing at Bristol County Superior Court . Yesterday, Hernandez's defense appeared to take a blow after they claimed he was forcibly searched by police - but footage shown at Bristol County Superior Court showed the former football player relaxing on his couch. The defense said the search amounted to unlawful questioning, and today a judge agreed that the police failed to provide a probable reason for the warrant. They maintain he wasn't free to leave. He has said he felt 'helpless' and worried about his family. Hernandez had earlier referred questions to his attorney. A trooper testified on Wednesday that Hernandez didn't seem frightened or raise concerns during the searches and said he could have left. Upset: She clutched her face as the judge decided bullets and a magazine found by police would be ignored . Hernandez's defense argued he was unlawfully questioned when police searched an apartment he was renting . Still smiling: His defense took a blow yesterday but the football player seemed laid back as his team spoke . Some testimony today focused on whether Hernandez was asked where his phone was. Now, Hernandez's attorneys are asking that some of that evidence obtained by officers be tossed out in court. A cell phone turned over by Hernandez that shows he had been in contact with Lloyd, and made plans to hang out with him close to the time he died, was obtained by the prosecution under a 'false claim of legal authority' the defense is arguing. Prosecutors have alleged that Hernandez and Lloyd exchanged text messages arranging a meeting on the night that Hernandez and two accomplices picked up Lloyd in Boston before driving him to North Attleboro and killing him. According to CBS Boston, the defense claims they did not have the proper warrant to obtain the phone. Pleaded: He has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and is calling on prosecutors to scrap some evidence . Claims: The 24-year-old insists he was left 'helpless' and worried when police searched his home . But yesterday prosecution released a video of the football player relaxed on his couch as police searched . Changes? His team want the trial moved out of Boston, where polls show most already think he is guilty . Judge Susan Garsh said earlier today she would not yet rule on the motion to suppress the cell phone evidence. The defense is also asking the judge for a change of venue, hoping to move the trial from Fall River, Massachusetts, to somewhere outside the Boston area. Their reasoning includes a poll finding that most people in Bristol County already think their client is guilty of first-degree murder. Hernandez was again in court today and, just like yesterday, seen smiling and laughing. He is also facing murder charges in Suffolk County for the July 2012 drive-by shootings of two men outside a Boston club.","Former New England Patriot laughed and joked with legal team in court .

"The body of missing Hollywood movie executive Gavin Smith has been found more than two and a half years after he disappeared and was presumed murdered, police said. The Los Angeles Country Coroner's Office confirmed a body found in a rural area of surburban Palmdale on October 26 was that of Smith, a 20th Century Fox executive who was last seen on May 1, 2012. A year into their investigation, police said they were treating the case as a homicide. Scroll down for video . Missing: 20 Century Fox executive Gavin Smith was last seen on May 1, 2012. After a year investigating his disappearance, police declared Smith dead and said it was a homicide case . Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Nicole Nishida said hikers stumbled across the body in the area, which includes the Angeles National Forest, on October 26, KTLA5 reported. They were later identified as the 57-year-old husband and father of three sons. A cause of death has not yet been determined, as autopsy results were not finalised, Nishida said. Smith was last seen in May in Ventura County in Los Angeles after leaving a friend's home. His wife, Lisa, reported him missing the following day when he failed to pick up their eldest son, Evan, to take him to school, as he had promised to do.

Found: Police today confirmed the identity of a body found on October 26 as that of Smith (pictured with wife Lisa) Happier times: Gavin Smith (left) and wife Lisa with their three sons Dylan, Evan and Austin . At the time he disappeared, Smith was reportedly having an affair with John Creech's wife, Chandrika Creech, whom he met in drug rehab. John Creech is currently in prison on unrelated drug charges. Frustrated police said that while they had a number of leads in the investigation, they did not have enough evidence to lay charges and the absence of a body was a significant hole in the case.

She also discovered he had a second mistress, named Melanie, in addition to Mrs Creech, and he was apparently setting up a home for her and her family. It was then - two weeks before he disappeared - that Lisa Smith threw her husband out of the house. Mrs Smith, in the MailOnline interview, said her husband appeared to be in the grip of a mid-life crisis in the time leading up to his disappearance, talking about buying new cars for his sons and dressing to impress woman. 'In hindsight, all the signs were there. He was dressing like a 20-year-old to go to drug rehab meetings and working out like mad,' she said. She said Fox stopped paying her husband's salary two months after he disappeared and cleared out his office. Staff left several cardboard boxes of personal items, including framed family photos and golf trophies, on Lisa’s front porch.

"As the man who claimed the first British men's singles title for 77 years at Wimbledon, you'd think Andy Murray had won enough honours this year. But the tennis ace triumphed over another net altogether: beating football, computer games and the Royal baby to become 2013's most-discussed event on Facebook. Murray mania clocked in at number one in Britain, followed by Baroness Thatcher's death at number two and the UEFA Champions' League final at number three. National pride: Andy Murray's win was the high point of a hot summer - and users took to Facebook to say so . Baroness Thatcher's death and funeral in St Paul's Cathedral, pictured, clocked in at number two, though not all comment was complimentary. While some praised the former PM's legacy online, others attacked it . Sport: Perhaps surprisingly considering both teams were German, the UEFA Champions' League final at Wembley stadium beat the birth of Prince George to third place. Pictured: Bonfim Dante fouls Marco Reus . The list sheds an interesting light on the topics that dominate British life, with some unexpected results. Two of the top ten were blockbuster computer games, Call of Duty: Ghosts and Grand Theft Auto 5, while live politics featured only once, with the introduction of the so-called 'bedroom tax'. Sport meanwhile dominated the list, taking four of the top ten spots including Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement from Manchester United and England's success in cricket at the Ashes. Television featured only once, with The X Factor clocking in at number eight. All the events could soon be challenged by the death of Nelson Mandela on Thursday, which drew interactions by more than 55 million people in the first day after it was announced. Baby mania: The birth of Prince George ranked higher globally, at number three, than it did in Britain . National pastime: Sport dominated the top ten, with Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement at number five . Perhaps understandably with about 1.2 billion Roman Catholics in the world, the election of Pope Francis was the top event globally, followed by 'election' - referring to many different countries - 'Royal baby'. Curiously enough, the news of Prince George of Cambridge coming into the world ranked higher globally, at number three, than it did in Britain, at number four. The social network also released lists of the places where people 'check in' the most. Unsurprisingly, the top ten in Britain was dominated by big sporting and music venues including The O2 arena in London, Wembley Stadium, the Westfield shopping centres and the theme parks Thorpe Park and Alton Towers. But it was the most fundamental part of human nature which won the day. The most-added 'life event' to users' timelines was a new relationship, engagement or marriage, a Facebook spokesman said.

"Samantha Cameron has arrived in Birmingham in time to hear the Prime Minister rehearse his speech before he stands up in front of the Tory conference tomorrow. The Conservative leader's wife beamed as she made her way inside the Hyatt Hotel in Birmingham, before posing up for photographs with her husband. David Cameron is due to give his keynote speech to the conference tomorrow, and was pictured earlier today preparing his notes. Scroll down for video . Arrival: Samantha Cameron arrives at the Birmingham Hyatt Hotel for the Conservative party conference . No doubt Mrs Cameron was due to be treated to an early rendition of Mr Cameron's speech, in which he is expected to set out his personal plan for Britain. Mrs Cameron, who is an ambassador to the British Fashion Council and a consultant for luxury firm Smythson, had ditched the tight cord trousers she wore earlier in the conference for a knee-length black skirt, paired with a khaki silk blouse and black heels. The warm September sunshine enabled her to go bare-legged and without a coat, although she held a black scarf in her hand as she made her way into the hotel. Couple: The Camerons pose up inside the conference venue ahead of tomorrow's final speeches . Style: Mrs Cameron had ditched the tight cord trousers she wore earlier in the conference for a knee-length black skirt, paired with a khaki silk blouse and black heels . Mr Cameron said that, unlike Labour leader Ed Miliband, he would be using a script while making his speech, and was pictured jotting down ideas in his hotel room prior to his wife's arrival. Last week Mr Miliband was ridiculed after forgetting to mention the deficit during his 69-minute address, claiming he did not want to read a script because he wanted to do politics differently. However, Mr Cameron said a script would help him to 'lay out my plan for Britain'. He told the BBC: 'I've been leader of my party for eight years and prime minister for four and I think people have a clear idea. I don't see a contradiction: if people are worried, is this country going to deliver for me? Is there a good job for my child? 'Is there a good school place and is there going to be a clean and safe environment? Are we going to be a country that keeps our promises to the poorest in the world because Britain means something in the world? 'I think all those things are connected and I think a modern compassionate Conservative can appeal to all of those and it actually all first together.' Making notes: Mr Cameron said that, unlike Labour leader Ed Miliband, he would be using notes while making his speech, and was pictured jotting down ideas in his hotel room prior to his wife's arrival . Announcement: Mr Cameron has promised 'many more' family doctors after the general election in order to deliver a pledge of extended-hours access to a GP seven days a week for every NHS patient in England . Today Mr Cameron has promised 'many more' family doctors after the general election in order to deliver a pledge of extended-hours access to a GP seven days a week for every NHS patient in England. Doctors' leaders warned that there would need to be significant additional funds and staffing to implement the pledge, announced by the Prime Minister at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. But Mr Cameron insisted that 8am-8pm opening, weekdays and weekends, was already in place for seven million patients after the launch last year of a £50 million fund in selected surgeries. He announced a further £100 million to ensure that at least 10 million are covered in 2015, and a further £400 million is earmarked to make the extended service nationwide over the five years following next May's election. The Prime Minister took part in a number of television and radio interviews today, in which he hailed Boris Johnson as a 'star player' and revealed he has still not apologised to the Queen for revealing she 'purred' down the phone when Scotland voted against independence. Double vision: Mr Cameron makes notes for his speech, while an interview he recorded earlier is played on TV . Mr Cameron has been hoping to use a round of media appearances to get a grip on the coverage of his party conference in Birmingham. It follows the shock defections of two MPs to UKIP, growing rows over Europe and the resignation of charities minister Brooks Newmark who sent an explicit picture of himself to an undercover journalist. Appearing on BBC2's Newsnight last night, Mr Cameron was asked a series of questions to shed light on his own character. Four decades since metres and litres replaced yards and pints on the curriculum, the Prime Minister suggested he would prefer to see a return to the old system. 'I think I'd still go for pounds and ounces, yes I do,' Mr Cameron told BBC2's Newsnight when asked which should be taught predominantly.","Conservative leader's wife pictured arriving at party conference venue .

'If he does that he’ll become the best sporting director in the world. He’s got a big personality and everybody respects him. 'I appreciate the professional that is Zlatan, the man that is Zlatan. He’s very, very funny. I want to keep some former players when they stop, for example Zoumana Camara is somebody I would like to keep with us.' Ibrahimovic remaining at the Parc des Princes would represent a major coup for Laurent Blanc's side, who have favoured former players taking up senior roles. Only this week Blanc himself has been talking about the potential return of Leonardo - who left the club in August.

"Beware the hotel front desk. Not only do they hold the key to your room, they also hold the key to the difference between an average or a premier stay. Knowing  how to ask staff for things, how much to tip, how to book, when to push your cause and when definitely not to can transform the service you receive. Doyen of the hotel industry Jacob Tomsky and author of Heads In Beds: A Reckless Memoir Of Hotels, Hustles, And So-Called Hospitality started life as a valet in New Orleans more than a decade ago and rose through the ranks to land a front desk job in New York. Scroll down for video . Jacob Tomsky says never book through discount websites such as Expedia or you'll get the worst rooms . As a result, he knows some of the best and worst secrets of the industry and shared some  with Metal Floss. Here, we run through some of his best revelations. 1.) Hotels make a packet on room rates . According to Jacob, the average cost to turn over a room and keep it sleep-worthy is just £25 ($40). That covers everything from washing sheets to electricity, hourly wages for housekeepers, minibar attendants, front desk agents and cleaning supplies. In other words, the whole shebang. 'The fact that a hotel could fail to be profitable astounds me,' says Jacob. Given that the average price of a four star hotel in London is about £140, they should be raking it in. Stay somewhere that costs much less than £25 a night and you'll know some serious corners are being cut. The average cost to keep a room operational is £25 ($40) so anything that costs less than that you should avoid . 2.) Never pay for the mini bar . Mini bars sit in every hotel room begging you to spend money. Amazingly, Jacob says you can almost always wriggle out of paying for them. According to him, the process for applying a mini bar bill is always horribly inexact and anything from keystroke errors, delays in restocking, double stocking and many other mishaps can cause miscalculations. People at the front desks don't want an argument. Jacob says, 'Even before guests can manage to get through half of the 'I never had those items' sentence, I have already removed the charges and am now simply waiting for them to wrap up the overly zealous denial so we can both move on with our lives.' Happy hour: Employees hate haggling with guests over the bar bill as all too often processing issues can occur . 3.) Phrase it right . Getting the front desk to take your latest gripe seriously can  be tricky. Jacob has some tips. 'Though most complaints should be delivered to the front desk directly, in person or on the phone, keep in mind that most issues will not have been caused by the front desk at all. So briefly outline your problem, offer a solution if you have one, and then ask whom you should speak with to have the problem solved. 'Should I speak to a manager about this?' 'Should I speak to housekeeping about this?' Those are wonderful and beautiful questions to ask.' Make it personal: Asking for the person's name who is dealing with your complaint will get it fixed faster . Best  of all? Ask for the employees name as nothing concentrates the mind better than knowing you can identify them later if everything is not resolved. 4.) Don't book on discount sites and expect the world . It's obvious but if you want the best room you have to fork out for it. Hotels  give those who book through last minute discounts sites such as Expedia the worst, smallest dingiest rooms. They know you've come to them because of a one-off deal - rather than through their own website - and most likely won't be a repeat visitor. It's obvious, but if you want the best room you have to fork out for it. Discount sites get given smallest rooms . James explains, 'First of all, we earn the slimmest profit from these reservations...[Secondly] since we have no reason to assume Internet guests will ever book with us again, unless our discount is presented to them, it truly makes business sense to save our best rooms for guests who book of their own volition.' 5.) Tip like your life depends on it . Every front desk wields a certain amount of power when it comes to awarding a guest a better time, and they're almost always authorised to upgrade for special occasions. Money talks: According to Jacob, all you need is £12 ($20) tip to ensure the front desk is in your pocket . Birthday or anniversary? Almost every front desk employee has the ability to upgrade for special occasions . There's always a room with a bigger TV screen, a room that, according to the building's layout, has a larger bath and two sinks or a room that although listed as standard has a great view. All it takes? A decent tip. 'When I feel that $20 (£12) you slipped me burning in my pocket, I will find [that upgrade] for you. And if there is nothing to be done room-wise, I have a slew of other options: late checkout, free movies, free minibar, room service amenities, and more. I will do whatever it takes to deserve the tip and then a little bit more in the hope that you’ll hit me again.' Play nice: To ensure you're not first on the list to get pushed from an overbooked hotel don't be rude to staff . 6.) Don't be shafted . Like  airlines,  hotels overbook rooms to compensate when people don't show up. Most guests still have to pay at least a 10 per cent charge for a no-show, so if the hotel fills the room on top of that they're laughing. If you're unlucky and everyone shows up the front desk will have to send some people packing or put them up for a night elsewhere. To ensure it's not you Jacob suggests (if you can) not using a discount site when booking, being a repeat customer, booking in for more than one night and not being rude or obnoxious to staff.","Front desk employee Jacob Tomsky spills beans on industry .
Average hotel room costs just £25 a day to stay operational .

"Takeaway curries might be tempting, but they may not contains the perfect ratio of ingredients. A physicist has revealed a complicated formula for the most satisfying curry by examining the key ingredients in all types of the popular dish. Dr Mark Hadley said the ideal curry must pass the 'fork test' so that every forkful and mouthful contains all the key ingredients in equal measure. Dr Hadley said that based on a 27cm plate size, the perfect meal requires a 23cm diameter bed of rice just 5mm thick, which supports a low dome of curry that is 14cm in diameter and is 2.4cm high at the tallest point . Dr Hadley, from the Department of Physics at the University of . Warwick said every forkful of curry should include meat or vegetable, sauce and rice in a ratio of 1:1:1. The golden ratio, which dates back to Ancient Greece, is said to be the most aesthetically pleasing, while satisfying taste and texture when it comes to certain foods. According to Dr Hadley, for the formula to work, the circle of rice bedded on the plate needs to be 61 per cent wider than the spherical cap of curry sat on top. That way the formula, which was commissioned by Tilda rice, can be applied to any size meal. For example, using a 27cm plate size, the perfect meal requires a 23cm diameter bed of rice just 5mm thick. This supports a low dome of curry which is 14cm in diameter and is 2.4cm high at the tallest point. Dr Hadley said, with a recommended portion size of 100g of cooked rice per person, the perfect meal requires 200g of curry to balance it visually. The plate should also contain 100g of meat or vegetables . Statistics from Tilda . Dr Hadley, who spent 40 hours devising the formula, said: 'We assume that, with a 27cm standard dinner plate, we want a 2cm clear band of clean plate around the outside of the rice. 'This is for aesthetic purposes and to allow room on the plate for ""breakage"" of the circle of rice when eating.' With a recommended portion size of 100g of cooked rice per person, or 60g uncooked, the perfect meal requires 200g of curry to balance it visually. The plate should also contain 100g of meat or vegetables. 'The fluffiness of the rice is key to the formula as, with the separate grains, there is as much air as rice when laid out on the plate,' Dr Hadley said. 'This affects the look of the rice and how it feels in the mouth. This changes the effective density of the rice and results in equal volumes of rice and curry having different weights,' he added. Curry is one of Britain’s most popular . dishes and the nation eats an estimated 3.5 million curries a week, with . and one in seven being tikka masalas. Anna Beheshi, senior brand manager at Tilda rice, said: 'The perfect curry really is about balancing each of the elements to ensure the best culinary experience possible. 'It is also important that the meal is visually appealing too, so the ""hill"" of curry sits perfectly on the wider base of rice.'","A University of .

"Nine rookie police officers have lost their jobs because of a drunken graduation party in northern New Jersey. It all happened when members of the academy’s 113th graduating class gathered at Texas Arizona in Hoboken, New Jersey, to celebrate their big day. A source says that the officers 'were drunk and out of control, and identified themselves as police officers when resisting bar bouncers who tried to quiet them.'

Now, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey says it's re-examining the entire candidate selection and training process. In a statement, executive director Pat Foye calls it 'a sad day' for the department. Foye says he was disappointed by their conduct and appalled by the 'poor judgment' of the police academy's staff who attended. Damning: It has been reported that the Internal Affairs Bureau got hold of 'devastating' video evidence from inside the bar which lead to the officers' dismissal . Three other new officers are suspended without pay for 30 days and will have their probationary status extended for a year. Three supervisors and two other officers will face disciplinary proceedings. No names were released. Video footage, along with eyewitness reports, led to the dismissals.

"Ted Bishop has been removed from his post as the president of PGA of America for the 'insensitive gender-based statements' he made about English golfer Ian Poulter on social media, the golf governing body announced after a vote on Friday. Bishop called Poulter a 'Lil Girl' in a series of outbursts on his personal Twitter on Thursday in a post that have since been deleted. He also elaborated on the comments on Facebook, describing Poulter as like a 'little girl screaming during recess'. Bishop, the 38th PGA president, was reacting to the English Ryder Cup star making critical remarks in his recently-released autobiography about Tom Watson and Nick Faldo's methods as captains in the Europe vs United States format. Ousted: Ted Bishop aimed an assault at Ian Poulter, who had criticized Nick Faldo's captaincy at the 2008 Ryder Cup. The PGA of America board voted to remove him from his position on Friday as a result . Offensive: This is the Tweet - which was deleted - from Ted Bishop that called Poulter a 'Lil Girl'. Those two words got the PGA chief sacked . 'Lil Girl': Poulter said the comments made by Bishop were 'disappointing for the leader of the PGA of America' Statement: Bishop apologized for his comments after he was removed from his position as PGA chief . Poulter hit back at the 38th PGA president, labelling the comments 'pretty shocking and disappointing', and on Friday the PGA of America announced it had voted to relieve Bishop of his duties. A statement read: 'The PGA of America board of directors voted today to remove Ted Bishop from office for insensitive gender-based statements posted yesterday on social media. The board deemed the remarks to be inconsistent with the policies of the PGA.' PGA chief executive Pete Bevacqu said: 'The PGA of America understands the enormous responsibility it has to lead this great game and to enrich lives in our society through golf. 'We must demand of ourselves that we make golf both welcoming and inclusive to all who want to experience it, and everyone at the PGA of America must lead by example.' Vice-president Derek Sprague has been appointed interim president until November 22, when there will be an election. Sprague said: 'We apologize to any individual or group that felt diminished, in any way, by this unacceptable incident.' The PGA of America acted following Bishop's comments about Poulter. Firing line: Poulter said English golfer Sir Nick Faldo (pictured) has lost a lot of respect from players because of his comments about Sergio Garcia. Bishop was responding to those claims . The Englishman also hit out at US golfer Tom Watson (pictured) for dropping Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley at the Ryder Cup . Bishop first wrote on Twitter: '@IanJamesPoulter -Faldo's record stands by itself. Six majors and all-time RC points. Yours vs. His? Lil Girl. @NickFaldo006 @pgaofamerica.' Bishop then expanded his point on Facebook, saying: 'Used to be athletes who had lesser records or accomplishments in a sport never criticized the icons. 'Tom Watson (8 majors and a 10-3-1 Ryder Cup record) and Nick Faldo (6 majors and all-time Ryder Cup points leader) get bashed by Ian James Poulter. Really? Sounds like a little school girl squealing during recess. C'MON MAN!' Poulter, himself yet to triumph in a major, was taken aback by the remark. 'Is being called a 'lil girl' meant to be derogatory or a put down?' Poulter told Golf Channel. 'That's pretty shocking and disappointing, especially coming from the leader of the PGA of America. No further comment.' The 38-year-old questioned Watson in his book, saying his captaincy at the recent Ryder Cup - which Europe won 16 1/2-11 1/2 - was 'utterly bizarre' and handed the initiative to Europe. Faldo, Europe's all-time leading points scorer, also came in for criticism from Poulter for saying Sergio Garcia was 'useless' in 2008 in television commentary. 'Faldo has lost a lot of respect from players because of what he said,' Poulter wrote in 'No Limits'. '[2008] is the only Ryder Cup we've lost in the last 15 years. And he was captain. Winners: Poulter and Garcia (right) celebrate with the trophy after Europe's Ryder Cup victory earlier this year . 'So who's useless? I think Faldo might need to have a little look in the mirror.' Bishop has since apologized for his comments. However he tried to fight his impeachment, refusing to step down as president until he could personally speak with the PGA board. After the meeting, the board voted and removed him . 'The board heard me out and then voted to impeach me,' Bishop said in a statement. That is the due process and I respect that, as painful as it might be.' In removing Bishop as president, he will be removed from the association's list of past presidents. Bishop went on: 'I want to apologize to Ian Poulter and anyone else that I might have offended with my remarks on social media that appeared on October 23, 2014. 'Particularly, I have great remorse that my comments contained the words 'little girl' because I have always been a great advocate for girls and women in golf. 'My two children, both girls, have made their careers in golf. I have a 4-year old granddaughter who I hope will someday play the game. In my 37-year career in golf, I have worked with many women to grow the sport and I have been a champion for inclusion and equal rights for women in golf. 'However, this is a classic example of poor use of social media on my part and if I had the chance to hit the delete button on the things that I sent out yesterday, I would without hesitation. 'The PGA of America asked me to avoid any interaction with the media in the past 24 hours and that is why I did not issue a formal and public apology, which I have wanted to do since early this morning.'","Ted Bishop called Ian Poulter 'a little school girl screaming during recess' on Twitter and Facebook for his criticism of Sir Nick Faldo and Tom Watson .

"Mary Kidson, 55, is accused of trying to harm her child by giving her medication that she did not need . A mother poisoned her daughter with a cocktail of drugs for medical conditions which didn't exist, a jury has been told. Mary Kidson, who runs an online tutoring service for children with special needs, is accused of trying to harm her child by giving her medication that she did not need after becoming convinced that she was ill. The mother-of-two gave her daughter the drugs in potentially harmful doses between December 2010 and March 2013, the court heard. The 55-year-old was arrested in March last year after police searched her £475,000 home in Ledbury, Herefordshire, and found 'a very large amount' of medication. Her daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given thyroid extract and oestrogen tablets. Prosecutor John Causer told Worcester Crown Court that Kidson had then gone from 'doctor to doctor' until she found one who 'told her what she wanted to hear'. Her daughter was also given hydrocortisone tablets after a doctor finally diagnosed deficiency of the adrenal glands. Ms Kidson continued to administer the tablets even after her daughter had recovered from the condition, Mr Causer said. He added that being 'shopped around and saddled with treatment' had harmed her daughter's health and emotional well-being. Ms Kidson is accused of three counts of unlawfully and maliciously administering a poison or noxious substance to her daughter, endangering life or inflicting grievous bodily harm. All the offences are alleged to have taken place between 2010 and March 2013. She has denied all charges against her. Opening the trial on Monday, Mr Causer said: 'Mrs Kidson is a mother and she is alleged to have attained and administered medication for a condition her daughter no longer had. 'Whether something is noxious depends on circumstances, and evidence in this case comes from medical experts. 'We will hear evidence tomorrow from a doctor who concludes that the defendant went to more and more doctors until eventually she got the answer she was looking for with treatment and medication. 'He says Mrs Kidson was trying to find a doctor who would give the treatment. 'He will say that the evidence doesn't support that the daughter had deficiency of the adrenal glands. 'Also, thyroid tests for the daughter were normal, and Mrs Kidson appears not to have understood that. Prosecutor John Causer told Worcester Crown Court, pictured, that Kidson had then gone from 'doctor to doctor' until she found one who 'told her what she wanted to hear' 'The daughter's health and emotional well-being we're harmed by being shopped around and saddled with treatment which was harmful to her. 'Mrs Kidson has taken her daughter from doctor to doctor until she found one who told her what she wanted to hear.' He said that other evidence will be given, noting that computer evidence and 'a very large amount' of medication was seized in a house search by police in March last year. Speaking of the risks posed by the medication, Mr Causer said that in the case of the hydrocortisone, Ms Kidson's daughter was given three times the recommended daily dose and that the effects of suddenly stopping taking the drug were 'extremely dangerous'. He said that the taking of oestrogen could 'result in various undesirable physical developments in the patient', while taking thyroid extract was 'undoubtedly harmful' and could lead to increased bone fractures and heart disease. Mr Causer said it had taken weeks for the victim's thyroid gland 'to recover from taking thyroid extract she did not need'. He also told the jury the matter was 'not an easy case - it's highly emotional', but he urged them to put that to one side as they heard the subsequent days of evidence. He said: 'We're not saying that Mary Kidson set out to harm her daughter or that she is not a loving mother but the consequences of these actions - even of a loving mother - can be very harmful,' The trial, which is expected to last between two and three weeks, continues.

"Starbucks has announced that it will offer a delivery option on its mobile app in select areas of the U.S starting next year. The Seattle-based company declined to provide more details, but has been pushing to get people to use its app as a way to build customer loyalty. It also previously said it plans to let customers across the country place orders ahead of time on their smartphone by next year, an option intended to get people in and out of stores quicker. 'We are playing offense,' CEO Howard Schultz said in explaining the various steps the company is taking to adapt to changing customer habits, including their move toward online shopping and away from brick-and-mortar stores. An even easier caffeine fix: Starbucks has announced that it will offer a delivery option on its mobile app in select areas of the U.S starting next year . The delivery plans for the second half of 2015 were announced by Schultz during a conference call Thursday discussing the company's fiscal fourth quarter results. For the period ended September 28, Starbucks reported sales that rose but fell short of Wall Street expectations. Global sales at established locations rose 5per cent, including in the Americas and Asia. Starbucks Corp. is pushing aggressively into different areas as it faces more competition from fast-food chains serving specialty coffees. To boost sales of food in the afternoon, for instance, it has been revamping its sandwiches and adding new offerings like a grilled cheese sandwich that's warmed up in an oven. This summer, Starbucks also launched its Fizzio soda drinks in the Sunbelt. But Wells Fargo analysts said in a note this week that their checks at a dozen stores in six states suggested the drinks aren't performing up to expectations so far. In a phone interview, Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead said the soda drinks are doing 'exactly what we expected it to do,' but that a national launch isn't planned for 2015. In a previous interview, Alstead had said he expected the drinks to be in much of the U.S. by the upcoming summer. Playing offense: Starbucks Corp. is pushing aggressively into different areas as it faces more competition from fast-food chains serving specialty coffees . Alstead said Starbucks is instead focusing on growing its tea business. He said tea accounted for a 'high single digit' percentage of sales last year, and that the company expects it to reach 'well into the teens' over time. For the quarter, Starbucks earned $587.9 million, or 77 cents per share. Not including one-time item, it earned 74 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations, according to FactSet. Revenue came in at $4.18 billion, short of the $4.24 billion analysts expected. For the current quarter ending in December, Starbucks expects its per-share earnings to range from 79 cents to 81 cents. Analysts expected 83 cents per share. The company expects full-year earnings in the range of $3.08 to $3.13 per share. Shares of Starbucks were down 4per cent at $74.04.",Starbucks is 'playing offense' after reporting disappointing quarterly sales on Thursday .
"Donna Air has revealed that her grandfather is suffering from dementia and is being cared for in a hospice. In a rare interview, Miss Air, 35, who is in a relationship with the Duchess of Cambridge’s brother James Middleton, spoke about the impact 'Grandpa Joe's' diagnosis has had on her family.. Miss Air, who rose to fame on teenage drama Byker Grove, said the illness has left him unable to recall her name at times but says she tries to 'make light of the sad times'. Upsetting: Donna Air has revealed that her grandfather is suffering from dementia in a rare interview . 'My grandfather has dementia,' she said. 'But it is life, and the family, in the northern style that we are, we find the nice parts and the humour and all that kind of thing. 'Sometimes you have to make light of the sad times. It is awful and I’m sure, if it happens to me my grandchildren, they have permission to make fun of Granny Donna. ‘I think you just have to do what you need to do in those situations. And all my family up north, it’s lucky, my grandfather has a really big Catholic family, so there’s lots of offspring who will take their part in looking after him.' Tragically however, the family has had to come to terms with the fact that he often struggles to recall the names of his children and grandchildren. c . Miss Air said they use humour to help themselves cope. 'One of the jokes actually, sometimes when I go home to visit he goes “hello pet, hello Donna.” Tragedy: Miss Air, pictured here with boyfriend James Middleton, says she looks for 'light in sad times' 'And they all go “oh, we might have known he’d remember you, the favourite one” lots of jokes like that. 'Whoever he remembers we make a joke “oh, might have known you’d be the one he’d remember”. So I always tease my relatives, “he’ll definitely remember me” as a joke. And it’s just pot luck.’ An unusually candid Miss Air also admitted to being unsure exactly how old her grandfather is – ‘grandparents just seem to have a generic age,’ she said. But she expressed joy at the fact her 11-year-old daughter Freya, whose father is her ex-partner Damian Aspinall, has known her great grandparents. 'It’s incredible, it’s amazing,' she enthused. 'I don’t remember meeting my great grandparents. So she’s very lucky.’ Miss Air is one of a number of celebrities to speak about dementia in recent months, including Mariella Frostrup, 51, Fiona Phillips, 53, Sir Michael Parkinson, 79, Arlene Phillips, 71, and Angela Rippon, 69, all of whom have lost parents to the disease. The former actress, a long-standing philanthropist, made her comments during Hospice Care Week, as she helped launch a new charity website. Current squeeze: Miss Air, 35, is currently dating the Duchess of Cambridge's brother, James Middleton, 27 . Connections: Miss Air, who has a 10-year-old daughter Freya, is now part of the Middleton family . Care2save.co.uk, which stocks six million products from more than 2,000 retailers including Topshop, Travelodge and mobile phone company O2, donates the commission it makes on sales, with a portion of the money going to the care industry. And Miss Air, who has in the past supported a range of other health charities including Macmillan Cancer Support and Jeans for Genes, said it was her grandfather’s illness her sparked her interest in the cause. ‘My grandfather is in a home, in a hospice,' she said. 'So I think any care that you can give and you know what, it’s not just people in hospices as well. 'They actually put the funds into people who need care at home too. So it’s just one of those things I feel a responsibility for.' Excitement: Like James, she is eagerly awaiting the birth of the Duchess of Cambridge's second child . Dementia, which can cause severe memory loss and confusion, is most prevalent among older people and affects one in six people over the age of 80, takes on many different forms, the most common being Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. A spokesperson for the Alzheimer’s Society, which is the largest dementia charity, said: 'A diagnosis of dementia can be very emotional both for the individual and their families. 'However, it is possible to live well with dementia and go on enjoying life with the right care and support. 'Timely diagnosis is vital and equally important is the need for greater investment in services for people with the condition. 'We would urge anyone who is concerned about dementia to speak to their GP today or contact Alzheimer's Society’s helpline for advice.'","Donna Air, 35, has revealed that her grandfather has dementia .

"Inspired by a fairground ride, this one of a kind pod brings together futuristic exteriors and cozy decor, for a product that's reminiscent of a mountain chalet. It may seem like an odd combination, but the result is nothing short of breathtaking. The Refuge Tonneau, originally designed by Charlotte Perriand and Pierre Jeanneret in 1938, has now been brought to life - thanks to Italian design firm, Cassina. The ingenious pod combines a futuristic aesthetic with a cosy mountain cabin-inspired wood interior . Dreamt up in 1938, the cabin has been brought to life seventy years later by Italian design firm, Cassina . The futuristic space shuttle-meets-mountain cabin is made up of lightweight aluminum panels on the outside, but full of homey wood accents on the inside. It was originally developed by Charlotte Perriand as a mobile mountain refuge that could battle even the most extreme weather conditions. And the dodecahedron's reconstruction has stayed true to their design. Lightweight aluminum panelling allows for the pod to be pitched anywhere and its wind resistant shell offers increased stability. The legs are even adjustable to adapt to uneven terrain. The pod has two floors and can accommodate up to eight guests - including four on the upper level (pictured) Exterior: The mobile mountain refuge is made of  wind-resistant aluminum, allowing it to be parked anywhere . Downstairs, foldable single beds come out of the wall, thanks to a system of leather belts. On the right, Charlotte Perriand's daughter Pernette Perriand examines the design plans . The entire pod is two floors and can accommodate up to eight guests. It also boasts a wood stove, foldable single beds - thanks to a system of leather belts - and a mezzanine with two doubles, as well as a wash basin to melt snow. Extremely functional, the Refuge Tonneau allows adventure-seekers to embrace nature in a very intense way, while also providing a beautiful minimalist space for rest and relaxation. Speaking about the project, Barbara Lehmann, Head of the Cassina Historical Archives, told MailOnline: 'The reconstruction was a very important research project carried out by Cassina in close collaboration with the daughter of Charlotte Perriand. 'It was essential to respect the original drawings, but also to discover further details, particularly for the interiors, by looking at other projects designed by Perriand and Jeanneret. 'The relationship between the human body and the way it interacts with the living space was fundamental in the design of Charlotte Perriand's furniture, as was the use of natural materials available to the architects at the time.' Seventy years in the making, the general public got a first glimpse at the architectural marvel  during the Salone de Mobile at the Milan Design Village in 2012.","The Refuge Tonneau is a mobile mountain pod with an aluminum exterior .

"Space race: Sandra Bullock in Gravity as Dr Ryan Stone, a medical engineer on her first space mission . You could call it the final frontier in gender equality. Though 12 men have set foot on the moon, no woman has yet taken that giant leap. But under extraordinary plans set out today, the world’s superpowers will come together to make it happen. And not content to stop there, they will also build a permanent base on its surface and then travel to Mars. Science minister David Willetts claims Britain can help bring the US, Europe and China together to take space travel into its next phase. Mr Willetts said Stevenage – the home of Space City, which makes a quarter of the world’s satellites – would be ‘at the heart of the global space effort’. Last year, republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich promised that if he won, America would have a permanent base on the moon by the end of his second term. The 12 men who have set foot on the moon have all been American, but the last one was 41 years ago. Mr Willetts predicted that it will actually be the Chinese who next return humans to the moon. China, Russia and the US are the only countries to have independently sent humans into space. Just days ago, Beijing also launched a rocket to the moon, carrying a small robotic device that will touch down on the lunar surface this weekend – the first controlled landing since 1976 on the Earth’s only natural satellite. China has stepped up its space efforts since US president Barack Obama cancelled Nasa’s Constellation programme, which had been designed to build a new generation of rockets that could send people to the moon and beyond. Advances: Last week, China released a computer graphic of the first ever moon rover Jade Rabbit . Chinese astronauts are expected to land on lunar soil between 2025 and 2030. ‘They are going to go first to the moon. They are landing an explorer vehicle this time,’ Mr Willetts said. ‘What they will subsequently do  is land and retrieve robotic  equipment. Then they will put a man – or I suspect a woman on the moon if they’re being smart – and then go on to Mars. ‘It’s a long term plan and we are up for co-operation with them. ‘Our hunger for discovery isn’t over. And one of the advantages of the challenge of getting a manned mission to Mars is that it such a big project that it probably requires global co-operation. 'I think if you got the major powers – the Europeans, the Americans and the Chinese – working together that is possible. It would be very exciting. In the old days it was Cape Canaveral. In the future it will be Stevenage at the heart of the global space effort,’ he said. As China launch their lunar probe, Science Minister David Willetts says the UK will be on board with new plans . ‘Stevenage is where we do our work on robotic systems. A lot of the technology for the Mars Rover vehicle, which the European Space Agency will launch in a couple of years’ time, was developed in Stevenage. We are in a very good position. We have got a very nimble and effective space industry. ‘We are trusted partners of America. We are active players in the European Space Agency and we are now opening up a new relationship with China.’ Mr Willetts said there was enormous potential for Britain to provide technology to ‘help with Chinese lunar exploration’ and missions deeper into space. He admitted there was ‘no agreed plan for getting to Mars’. But he added: ‘In the future I think there will be humans going to Mars. I suspect it will be a global endeavour. I think it is possible within 30 years.’","Plans outlined today show UK, US and China plan to establish moon base .

"At least 16 people were killed in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo when government troops bombed a building in a rebel-held neighbourhood, activists have said. The Britain-based activist group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which opposes the regime, said government troops bombarded a building in Aleppo's rebel-held neighborhood of Ansari and killed at least 16 people, including ten children and youths. Turkey, meanwhile, today pledged its . continued support for the Syrian opposition, saying its leaders should . not be pressured into talks with the regime as civil war rages. The Aleppo Media Center, a network of anti-regime activists in the city, said 20 people were killed in the shelling of Eastern Ansari. An amateur video released by the group showed a building reduced to a pile of debris with dozens of people digging through the rubble in search for survivors. Bombing: Activists have said at least 16 people were killed in the airstrike today on a rebel-held neighbourhood in Aleppo . Devastation: People try to recover victims following the blast, which the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said killed ten children and young people . Rescue operation: A man holds a child in his arms in Aleppo as people hunt for survivors following today's bombing . Rubble: An amateur video released by the Aleppo Media Center showed a building reduced to debris with people digging through the rubble looking for survivors . 'The family of the man over there is still under the rubble,' a man could be heard saying, referring to another, standing in the area. In southern Syria, the Observatory said troops shelled the city of Daraa, the birthplace of the uprising, and killed at least one rebel. The group added that troops shelled the nearby towns of Kahil, Saida and Tel Shehab wounding a number of people. In other violence in the city, the official SANA news agency said a former parliament member, his wife and two daughters were killed near the Aleppo airport. The report said 'terrorists,' the term the Syrian government uses for rebels, fired at Ibrahim Azzouz's car in Sheik Said neighborhood, killing the family. Rebels captured the strategic Sheik Said neighborhood south-east of Aleppo on Saturday. It was a significant blow to regime forces because the area includes the road the army has used to supply troops. Troops loyal to Assad and rebels have been locked in a deadly stalemate in Aleppo, Syria's largest urban center and main commercial hub, since an opposition assault last summer. Seven months later, the rebels hold large parts of the city and its outskirts, including several army bases. But they have been unable to overcome the regime's far superior firepower. Airstrike: A building was reduced to a pile of rubble in the attack, which left residents digging through the remnants searching for survivors . Turkey has pledged to continue to support the Syrian opposition. Speaking at a security conference in Germany, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said his country supported efforts to end the bloodshed in Syria, but he understood the opposition's refusal to talk to President Bashar Assad after so many Syrian deaths in the fight to topple him. 'It is easy to say now, (the) opposition should accept to sit with the regime, after 60,000 people have been killed,' Davutoglu said at the gathering of top diplomats and security officials in Munich. 'Assuming that tomorrow there is a new election in (Assad's) presence, who will guarantee the safety of the opposition leaders?' Davutoglu said. Opposition leaders categorically refused any talks with Damascus until Assad steps down. In a sharp departure from their resolve, the coalition's president, Moaz al-Khatib, said Wednesday he is willing to talk to the regime if that would help end bloodshed. Like the United States and its Western allies, Turkey has repeatedly called on Assad to step down. Assad brushed the calls aside, outlining a peace proposal last month that would put him in charge of national reconciliation talks. Russia, Assad's most important international ally, said the insistence on his ouster before political talks can begin was counterproductive. Another staunch supporter of Damascus, Iran, said Tehran would welcome the opposition leaders to talks. 'Iran has talked to the opposition,' Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said in Munich. 'We are ready to be part of the solution,' he insisted. 'The sooner that we resolve the issue, the better it is.' Syrian television broadcast images of what it said was the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike on a research facility near Damascus earlier this week, showing destroyed vehicles and moderate damage to a building. Israel has not publicly acknowledged Wednesday's airstrike that US officials said had hit a convoy of anti-aircraft weapons inside Syria bound for the militant Lebanese Hezbollah group. The Syrian military said the target of the Israeli jets was a scientific research centre in the area of Jamraya, north-west of Damascus. The strike raised tensions between Israel and its neighbour Syria, which is engulfed by the raging civil war. The first purported images of the targeted site, aired by Al-Ikhbariya TV on Saturday, show the twisted and battered remnants of cars, trucks and military vehicles. Destruction: Today's airstrike, in the Aleppo neighbourhood of Ansari, destroyed a building and killed at least 16 people . Search: People try to recover victims from among the rubble following the devastating blast . Neighbourhood: The full devastating effects of the bomb can be seen as people stand among the rubble and the dust . Victim: A man is taken away on a stretcher as residents continue to hunt for survivors . A building has broken widows and damaged interiors, but no major structural damage. The caption says, 'Consequences of the Israeli aggression on the Jamraya centre'. State TV also ran footage of the damage. Syria's regime vowed revenge for the airstrike while the rebels battling president Bashar Assad criticised him for not responding to what they termed Israeli aggression. According to a US official, the strike targeted trucks containing SA-17 anti-aircraft missiles. The trucks were next to the research centre the Syrians identified and the strikes hit both the trucks and the facility. Advanced anti-aircraft missiles like the SA-17 in the hands of Hezbollah could change the strategic equation, which so far has allowed Israel to send warplanes over Lebanon practically unopposed. Desperate: In an amateur video released during the aftermath of the bombing, one man can be heard saying: 'The family of the man over there is still under the rubble' The Syrian military denied that the target of the attack was a weapons convoy. It said low-flying Israeli jets crossed into the country over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights to target the Jamraya centre. Until Wednesday, Israel has been reluctant to do anything that would seem an intervention into Syrian civil war. The airstrike adds another layer to the complexity of the Syrian conflict that has left the international community at a loss for ways to end bloodshed. The uprising against president Assad began in March 2011 with largely peaceful pro-reform protests and developed into a civil war which the United Nations says has killed more than 60,000 people. The Syrian government maintains that there is no uprising in Syria but a conspiracy against the country because of its support for anti-Israeli groups.

"The University of Texas will pay its student football and basketball players $10,000 a year to fund expenses not covered by a full scholarship and to compensate for the University's use of students' images. The school has not yet set a date for when they'll be cutting their students paychecks. University of Texas Athletic director Steve Patterson said on Tuesday that the $6 million annual budget for student compensation isn't going to burn a hole in their pocket but that even rich programs like UT's will need to set aside funds for the future if they continue to treat their athletes like employees or semi-pros, reports the Dallas News. Payday: Scholarship athletes on the Texas Longhorns team will be $10,000 richer sometime in the near future after a federal ruling ordered colleges to be more generous towards their athletes . Outspoken: University of Texas Athletic director Steve Patterson said on Tuesday that the school will need to set aside funds for the future if they continue to treat their athletes like employees or semi-pros . Patterson addressed an audience of athletic professionals in a forum on the ever-changing business of college sports. Football Scoop reports that the $10,000 per student will be split evenly between the cost-of-attendance and payment for use of the athletes name and image. The $10,000 figure is the one U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken set in her Ed O'Bannon trial ruling in August. UCLA basketball star Ed O'Bannon and 19 others successfully sued the NCAA for violating antitrust laws by blocking athletes from getting a share of the revenues generated from the use of their images in broadcast and video games, reports ESPN. 'The Court finds that the challenged NCAA rules unreasonably restrain trade in the market for certain educational and athletic opportunities offered by NCAA Division I schools,' Wilken wrote. Football Scoop reports that the $10,000 figure is bound to fluctuate. 'If we begin to [further] remunerate the participants (over and above this figure), that’s going to break that model,' Texas women’s athletics director Chris Plonsky said. Athletic forum: Steve Patterson and other school athletic professionals convened on Tuesday to talk about the future of college sports and how they will need to adjust their budget to account for the future . Chis Plonksy explained that the school already employs 350 workers to coach and care for the students who play in Austin. She added that the money for all of that jobs come from just two sports, football and men's basketball. Participants of the athletic forum concluded that colleges will be asked to do even more and that they will need yon adjust their business models to make way for the change. Other panellists expressed their desire for a stronger governing rule in college sports. 'We’re in for a period of dynamic change, ‘said McMillen, a basketball player for the University of Maryland who also played for the United States in the 1972 Olympics in Munich. 'The system has to change. The money needs to be handled differently.' 'Everybody is in charge and nobody is,' said former Athletic Director at Arizona State, Lisa Love. 'What I’m looking for is a benevolent dictator for college sports,' said McMillen. USA Today Sports writer Steve Berkowitz said that he worries that schools will spend too much money in order to keep their teams in the running for the championship. Chris Del Conte who serves as Athletic Director at Christian University (TCU) said that schools who choose to spend money in top athletics should be rewarded for their investments. TCU said they made the investments neccesary to compete at a national level and were able to joing a major athletics conference. 'We invested, even back when we didn’t know the future of that investment,' he said. 'We decided, and our alumni had decided, that we were going to compete.' TCU was able to raise $15 million to rebovate a 45,000 seat stadium. After renovations the applicant pool grew much, much larger. They saw 20,000 applications a year for 1,600 spots.

"George Osborne's 10-year-old daughter marched around the Downing Street family home wearing a suffragette outfit to demand a woman was depicted on a banknote, the Chancellor revealed. He said Liberty was furious and forced him to intervene to ensure that Jane Austen would appear on the new £10 note. The Chancellor also revealed his 13-year-old son Luke inspired his support for an American football team based in London. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne with his two children Luke, 13, and Liberty, 11, who both attend St Paul's . Mr Osborne said he faced a 'difficult conversation' with Liberty over the banknote and tried to explain that the decision was not just his to make. 'My first attempt was a politician's answer: 'You've got to understand that although daddy is chancellor he doesn't get to design the banknotes,' he said. 'But she saw right through that! And now we'll have Jane Austen on the £10 note.' The Pride and Prejudice writer was revealed as the face of the new £10 note in July after an online campaign by Caroline Criado-Perez. Jane Austen  was revealed as the face of the new £10 note in July after an online campaign supported by (l-r) Mary Macleod, Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, Stella Creasy and Caroline Criado-Perez . The Chancellor said he entered into politics to fix public finances and deal with the fact that Britain is spending beyond its means . This came after the Bank faced criticism over a plan for Winston Churchill to feature on the new fiver, meaning there would not be a woman on any English note. Unlike David Cameron and Michael Gove, Mr Osborne does not send send his children to state schools. They both attend prestigious St Paul's and the Chancellor brushes aside any criticism about this decision. He told The Times Magazine: 'I've never used my family as a political gesture. And surely that would be more inauthentic if you were choosing your children's schools on the basis of what you think people thought of you?' The Chancellor said his  support for the plan to get an NFL American football team to be based at Wembley stems from his son's love of the game. Mr Osborne, who studied in the US, admires the numbered plays, the chess-like tactics and the physical toll that can destroy the most promising player. The NFL has staged a series of games at Wembley since 2007, attracting near-capacity crowds. The Chancellor said he entered into politics to fix public finances and deal with the fact that Britain is spending beyond its means. He said: 'You know what makes me angry is when people say, 'it's the poor who are suffering the most'. And I say: 'It's the poor who suffer the most when the economy fails. 'I want people to know that I care, because I do care. You know, there's never a day that I've done this job when I've been flip about it.' George Osborne has defended the deal that will leave Britain paying an extra £850 million towards the European Union budget, . He insisted it was a 'real win' despite accusations he has resorted to 'smoke and mirrors'. Critics claimed the reduction in the £1.7 billion bill had been achieved by bringing forward a rebate to which the UK would have been entitled anyway. But the the Chancellor insisted there had been 'real doubt' over whether that clawback would apply to the surcharge. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The truth is, as always, we have achieved a real win for British taxpayers and having achieved it everyone says 'oh, of course you were always going to achieve that'. 'But it took a lot of hard discussion, a lot of hard negotiation and it shows that when this government sets out a goal in Europe it goes and achieves it.' Mr Osborne said it was 'not clear' that the rebate was going to apply to the surcharge, which was demanded after a recalculation of Britain's gross national income (GNI) relative to the other 27 member states, until the deal was struck in a summit with fellow EU finance ministers in Brussels. 'It was a real doubt about whether the rebate would apply, apply to the extent it has applied. We have got this bill halved.'","Osborne's daughter marched around Downing Street in a suffragette outfit .
