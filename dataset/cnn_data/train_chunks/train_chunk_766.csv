The sequence of images follows the bird from being perched on a post to taking flight after spotting a helpless mouse with its piercing yellow eyes. In one of the shots, the bird flashes an glance to the camera as if to say 'watch this', before swooping on the unsuspecting creature.

A small explosion of powder shoots off the turf as the owl's claws grab the rodent as it swoops down, wings outspread, to grab its dinner. And seconds after spotting dinner, it soars off into the sky before gobbling down the feast. Photographer Peter Stahl, who took the images in Alberta, Canada, said he was so focused on capturing the shot he wasn't able to enjoy the incredible moment until afterwards.

Manchester City fans might have thought that the trip to Barcelona couldn’t get much worse after watching their side lose 4-1 on aggregate to the Spanish champions at the Nou Camp. Manchester City fans were wrong. Hundreds of Blues supporters were forced to fly to Newcastle instead of Manchester in the early hours of Thursday morning because of a blanket of thick fog over the runway at the city’s airport. Two Jet2 planes from Barcelona were diverted to the North East from Barcelona following City’s 2-1 defeat. More woe: Manchester City fans file through Newcastle airport after their flight was diverted . Oh dear: Manchester Evening News reporter Mike Keegan was on the flight and posted this picture . No way: So bad was the visibility that the planes (not pictured) were forced to fly further north . Agonisingly for the Blues fans on board, who had already endured watching another Champions League disappointment in Catalonia, the plane was preparing to land at Manchester before picking up speed and heading further north. Manchester Evening News reporter Mike Keegan was on one of the services, and told the paper: ‘The wheels were down and it looked like we were moments away from landing when it picked up speed and lifted.’ The flight circled above Bolton for half-an-hour before heading to Newcastle airport to finally land. The planes were due to touch down in Manchester at around 2am, but coaches arrived in Newcastle to take the passengers home at 5am.

Pablo Zabaleta was also sent off for dissent when the Blues were denied a penalty by French referee Stephane Lannoy in the second half. Another fan, Ian Martin, 61, was on the other flight and quipped:  ‘We had two goes at landing. We thought the ref might have had a word with the pilot!’ Keegan, who was on the coach with the supporters, tweeted at around 8.15am: ‘Almost there!’ At least the City fans won’t forget this Champions League trip in a hurry.","Two planes due to land at Manchester Airport at 2am .

The charity has blamed the wood company TimberSIL for providing the lumber, which is a non-burning glass-and-wood blend and had been guaranteed for 40 years. ‘It was unable to withstand moisture, which is obviously a big problem in New Orleans,’ Make It Right representative, Taylor Royle, told the New Orleans Advocate, according to Radar.

"By . Sam Creighton . PUBLISHED: . 07:24 EST, 14 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:43 EST, 14 March 2014 . Controversial Jeopardy! champion Arthur Chu has revealed his favourite part of his 12-show run was not walking away with a whopping $300,000 in prize money but overhearing the show's camera men exclaiming 'this kid is too damn good.' The 30-year-old insurance analyst bared all to Reddit users yesterday, taking part in one of the social-networking website's 'Ask Me Anything' events, where a celebrity fields questions from the site's users. When asked to describe the atmosphere behind the scenes of the television show, which was first broadcast in America 50 years ago, Mr Chu, from Broadview Heights, Ohio, said: 'I never saw Alex [Trebeck, the presenter] at all backstage, though he was very nice to everyone during the little chats during the credits. Scroll down for video . Arthur Chu was surprised by how much of a backlash there was against him but doesn't let it faze him . 'The crew were also great to me - though I confess the best part was overhearing snatches of conversation behind my back with two camera guys going ""This kid is too damn good!""' Mr Chu finished third on Wednesday's edition of Jeopardy!, ending a winning streak that has garnered a lot of media attention for his unorthodox approach. His strategy involved ditching . the usual style of finishing each category's questions before moving on. Instead, he switched-up his category choices, seemingly at random, to keep his opponents guessing. After spending weeks studying the game before his appearances, he concluded that the bottom rows of the game board are most likely . to contain the hidden Daily Doubles - where contestants have a chance to double their winnings - and he played specifically to seek them out. Chu's run makes him the third most successful contestant ever to appear on Jeopardy! - outside of special competitions - but he was still a way behind reigning champion Ken Jennings, who walked away with $2.5million after 74 consecutive victories in 2004. Chu's aggressive . strategy earned a lot of flak from fans of the show, particularly on social media, as they felt it showed a lack of respect of the game's conventions. Jeopardy! champ Arthur Chu plans to take his wife Eliza Blair on a vacation to China . Chu told Reddit that while he expected some backlash, he was shocked at how vehement his critics became. He said: 'I wasn't surprised that there was a negative reaction - in researching past contestants like Roger Craig and Dave Madden who've had a similar playstyle I saw a ton of hate for them from Internet Mean Girls. 'I was still surprised to get as much hate as quickly as I did -- I thought people might get mad at me after I'd been on the show for a while, but I kind of got freaked out at how many negative tweets there were after just my first night.' He singled out some of the abuse as particularly spiteful. He said: 'The most mind-blowing one was the one that literally said ""I hope your wife dies"". That's beyond even clever trolling to just straight-up mental problems.' Despite all this hate, Chu told Reddit users he did not let it get to him. 'I don't really get mad on a personal . level with haters because, well, how can I take it personally when they . don't know me as a person?' he said. 'It's such a clichéd lesson to say you've . learned but having been on the ""celebrity"" side of the fence I kind of . see how messed up it is, people making judgments about you based on one . thing you said or one face you made in front of a camera.' Chu hopes his experience of dealing with the social media controversy could help him cash in even further and he is considering writing a book on the subject. Arthur Chu, 30, pictured with Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek, won a whopping $297,000 using game theory . He said: 'If I ever do write something it'll probably be more addressed at the social-media backlash and the backlash-to-the-backlash and the whole weird phenomenon of being a media ""villain"", which to me is the much more unique part of the story.' While previous AMAs with high-profile figures such as Barack Obama and Bill Gates attracted nearly 30,000 comments, Mr Chu's saw 1,500 messages posted onto his thread. However, despite the lower turnout, his jokey tone during the conversations was in stark contrast to the dour - at times even arrogant - persona he adopted while on television. Arrgh: Arthur's game-play tactics appear to delight and frustrate viewers in equal measure . The change of tack even allowed him to win over some former critics, with one user posting: 'Arthur, the first night you were on jeopardy, I tweeted you (""Please, Arthur, do not win #jeopardy. I will not watch another episode with you on it"" @amyedwardst). You tweeted back and I felt really bad/guilty. Did I hurt your feelings? I really am very sorry. Congratulations on your winnings! I miss you being on the show.' According to Chu, his cold persona was never meant to come across as brash and thinks that letting it slip was the reason for his downfall. He said: 'It wasn't really a conscious strategy to intimidate people. I think when I said that the game is ""about intimidation"" a lot of my critics took that to mean I was a dick, like I walked into the green room, folded my arms and spat ""Buncha lousy maggots"" at all y'all. Champion Chu: Arthur, who took home close to $300,000 in prize money before finally being kicked off Jeopardy! on Wednesday night, told GMA he planned to spend the money wisely . 'In reality the main thing was that I knew that lots of Jeopardy contestants are smart but it's their emotions that make them lose. And I was really really intent on not letting my emotions get to me -- in the end I was unsuccessful and went ""on tilt"" once I started having a bad day, leading to my loss, but it was being a ""robot"" onstage that kept me from freaking out and kept me focused enough to still pull out victories even after taking big losses.' Chu has a number of ideas of how to best use his financial windfall. Firstly, he plans take his wife, Eliza, on holiday to China but then intends to split the rest of the $297,200 jackpot between investments and charitable donations. When pushed on which charities he might choose, Chu gave the controversial answer of WikiLeaks, an organisation that has been in the news as much for its founder Julian Assange's alleged crimes as it has for its work supporting whistleblowers. He said: 'I'm super troubled about the things we continue to learn about the US government's surveillance of the Internet, the way our wars are being conducted overseas without a proper sense of law or accountability, etc. 'I have a lot of differences with Wikileaks as an organization and Julian Assange in particular as a person, but it's the only organization big enough and loud enough to be making a major difference with those issues right now and I cannot believe how incredibly f***** up it was that the whole banking industry basically colluded to make it impossible to donate money to them and most people did not apparently see anything wrong with this.' Chu, who works as a voice over artist on the side, said his only regret about his appearance on the show was allowing producers who convince him to demonstrate his voice skills on national television as he thinks, looking back, it was far from his best work. However, overall he said he had 'a blast' and said 'it's never a bad thing to come home to your wife and tell her you just made $100,000 for one day of work.' He said: 'So much ridiculously good stuff has happened -- not just the money but the insane 15 minutes of fame I've gotten, the Twitter fan following, the crazy experiences like being flown out to NYC on ABC's dime to be on national TV -- that I'd be an ass to say I regretted any of it. 'Like I said I even have to be grateful to the haters because I'd never have attained the status of ""supervillain"" if not for their outsized negative response to me.' However, he did admit that it didn't feel that way at the time. 'Yes, in retrospect I had a blast. It was an amazing experience -- but at the time it wasn't fun, it was pure pain and sacrifice. It's the kind of ""fun"" that's fun in your memory because you worked your ass off at something incredibly hard and against all odds you got good at it and it paid off -- but at the time you're suffering,' he said. Mr Chu was finally unseated by Diana Peloquin of Ann Arbor, Michigan, who led Wednesday's show with $15,700. Chu, who described Peloquin on Reddit as a 'worthy successor', struggled for much of the show when, in Final Jeopardy, he risked, . and lost, his entire day's bankroll - $6,400 - on the question: 'He was . the last male monarch who had not previously been Prince of Wales.' Only Peloquin had the correct response: George VI.","Arthur Chu, a 30-year-old from Ohio, took to the social networking site to answer questions from users .

Gary Neville has hit out at Arsene Wenger for failing to give Arsenal star Mesut Ozil a rest during the Premier League Christmas period whilst revealing Cristiano Ronaldo would often be given a festive rest by Sir Alex Ferguson during his time at United. Ozil is set for at least a 'few weeks' on the sidelines after suffering a hamstring injury during the Gunners' Champions League exit at the hands of Bayern Munich on Tuesday night. The Germany midfielder had looked refreshed after playing a key role in Arsenal's 4-1 FA Cup quarter-final win over Everton on Saturday, but has often been accused of a lack of effort in big matches since the turn of the year. Out: Mesut Ozil (right) is set for a spell on the sidelines after injuring a hamstring against Bayern Munich . Injury: Ozil (second right) was replaced by Tomas Rosicky at half-time in Germany . Neville took to Twitter to shares his view on Wenger's decision to keep playing Ozil throughout a difficult Christmas spell. He tweeted: 'Ozil getting a hard time. He's obviously dipped this last couple of months and first season in a new league (Xmas football) can take some getting used to even with the price tag.Some players can carry lack of form better than others. 'His body language suggests he struggles and at the moment looks like he's finding it difficult mentally. However arsenal are better for having him and he will return strong! Tired? £42.5m Ozil (left) struggled in Munich before being taken off at half-time . 'And finally he will improve more when he has a Striker that runs beyond and provides movement for his strengths. 'Some rightly pointing out others who have been up and down in the first season but then improved second and third. 'Every good num 10 needs 2 to 3 players that make runs behind and sacrifice themselves! Modern game problem - Too many want to be a num 10! 'On Xmas break - no excuse really for an experienced manager. He could have given him one first two weeks in Jan- Ronaldo used to get one!'

Killer blow: Bastian Schweinsteiger fires home to make it 1-0 to Bayern Munich on Tuesday . Mistake: Gary Neville believes Arsene Wenger should have rested Ozil earlier in the season . Opener: Ozil scored the first of Arsenal's four goals against Everton in the FA Cup on Saturday . Wenger said: 'We have to make a scan tomorrow (Wednesday) to see how bad it is but he's out for at least a few weeks. I hope it's not too bad.' Ozil's new injury means the £42.5million summer signing will be out for Arsenal's north London grudge match against Tottenham on Sunday as the Gunners' title charge begins to hit a wall. The Gunners faced the difficult task of having to overcome a 2-0 deficit from the first leg of their last-16 clash in London last month and bowed out of the Champions League despite a spirited 1-1 draw against the Champions League holders at the Allianz Arena. Well rested: Neville revealed Sir Alex Ferguson would give Cristiano Ronaldo (above) a Christmas break . Wenger felt his side could have pulled off another shock result as they did last season, when winning 2-0 here, but bowing out on away goals. 'Our defending, our spirit was good. The frustration we had was the last 20 minutes I felt that Bayern was very vulnerable defensively and that we didn't take advantage of that,' he said. 'We always missed the first pass, but I felt the situations were there where we could have made more of it. 'At the end of the day we never got them really under pressure.'

A grand jury will now decide whether any charges will be filed against a Texas father who fired one fatal shot at a 17-year-old boy he found in his teenage daughter's bedroom early Thursday morning. As photos of victim Johran McCormick emerged on Friday, his heartbroken family said the least they expect is an apology from the gun-wielding dad, who constables say was on 'several medications' at the time of the incident. 'I would like my baby back, but I know that's not possible,' the victim's mother, Zakia McCormick, told KHOU 11 News. 'I have never ever felt a pain like this. Ever. '(I want) a call, you know.

Daddy got his gun: An unidentified father (pictured above on a stretcher) shot dead a 17-year-old boy after finding the teen in bed with his 16-year-old daughter this morning in Spring ,Texas . Authorities have confirmed Johran McCormick, a 17-year-old Klein Collins High School student, was not armed when he was shot . Investigators said the suspect's 16-year-old daughter let the boy into the house. The father told police that he was woken up by one of his four children who said someone was in the house, which is located on the 22300 block of Bridgestone Ridge Dr in Spring. At first, the daughter denied knowing the boy and an argument ensued between the stranger and the father when he wouldn't listen to the father's commands. When the teen reached for something, the father shot and killed the boy. Authorities say the teen was unarmed. The 16-year-old daughter later admitted to knowing the boy and letting him into the house. The father was seen being brought out of the house on a stretcher. He was transported to hospital with symptoms of a panic attack, according to reports. The 55-year-old father was taken to the hospital after complaining of a panic attack . The 17-year-old boy was pronounced dead on the scene . 'He didn't deserve to die like that': The family of Johran McCormick are heartbroken over the teen's shooting death . A news release from the Harris County Sheriff's Office said officers are preparing a case that will be presented to the grand jury. It is not uncommon in Harris County for grand jurors to decide if a crime was committed in fatal shootings that may have self-defense claims or other legal issues, according to the Houston Chronicle. In 2008, a grand jury declined to indict Pasadena retiree Joe Horn after he fatally shot two burglars in the back as they ran across his front yard. Horn made national headlines because he was on the phone with a 911 operator who was telling him to stay inside and out of harm's way. The Nov. 14, 2007, call ended with the sound of Horn racking a shell into his 12-gauge shotgun's chamber, followed by three gunshots that killed Colombians Diego Ortiz, 30, and Hernando Riascos Torres, 38. Police showed up at the house shortly after 2:30am when they received a 911 call from one of the father's other daughters . Lied: When first asked, the father's 16-year-old daughter said she didn't know the boy she was in bed with, but later took it back . Grand jurors in that case decided the act was a justifiable use of deadly force and did not constitute murder. The men had taken about $2,000 from the home next door to Horn's. Horn's defense hinged on his assertion that he had fired out of fear for his life, making the shooting justifiable under Texas law.","Unidentified father, 55, was woken up by one of his other children sometime before 2:30am Thursday about a stranger in the house .

A Washington father is battling his city council to be allowed to keep a tree house that he built for his sons in the front yard of his home. Zeb Postelwait had always wanted to build a tree house for his sons. He got the chance last summer after moving into a Wenatchee home with a big tree in the front yard. Two months later, he received his first notice from the city to tear it down because it is a threat to public safety and overhangs a public sidewalk. Alternatively, city officials said, the tree house can remain, but only if Postelwait takes out a $1 million insurance policy.

The Wenatchee World reports officials say the treehouse overhangs the sidewalk, threatening public safety. Postelwait disagrees. 'If something happens, the city is liable for the damages,' Mayor Frank Kuntz told the Bellingham Herald. 'The council was unanimous in directing me to do what we're doing. It has to come down.' Postelwait says he's being 'harassed' by the city, and that he is not in violation of any codes. From on high: The city council has asked Postelwait to take down the structure, but he refuses . Branching out: Postelwait built the tree house himself, and says he spoke to an engineer before he began construction .

City codes forbid obstructing . sidewalks, but Postelwait says there's nothing in the rulebook about . obstructing the air 30 feet above the sidewalk. City . officials say Postelwait could keep the tree house if he takes out a $1 . million insurance policy, an idea Postelwait says is preposterous. 'A million dollars? For a tree house?' he told the Bellingham Herald. 'Come on!' In response to Postelwait's refusal to . take down the tree house, the city is planning to have an engineer . evaluate the integrity of the structure and then obtain a court order to . have the tree house taken down.

'We've sent him lots of warning letters. If he'd just take it down, we could avoid all that.' Postelwait says the treehouse is perfectly safe and that he conferred with an engineer before building it. There are about 10 bolts anchoring the house to the tree and a cable system rated to 800lb supporting it. 'How can they take me to court over an obstruction that doesn't exist?' he asked.

A Long Island man with no patience for traffic jams has won $5 million after stopping to buy some lottery tickets on his way home from work to pass the time until a bumper-to-bumper back-up cleared. Thomas Mainella, 62, an electrician from Melville, pulled over after hitting a road detour in Plainview and bought six Set for Life scratch-off tickets from Sunny's Cards and Gifts. He decided to scratch all six at the store but never made it past the fifth. 'I'm a winner!': Thomas Mainella (center) with his girlfriend Donna (right) 'I scratched that and it said ""life"" and I just went ""I'm a freaking winner!' Mainella told Fox and Friends. Mainella is a longtime lottery player and always imagined his numbers would come up. 'I've always told people I'm going to win big on this game. They all thought I was crazy,' he told the New York State Lottery. Mainella said he's always fantasized that if he won, he'd rent a limo to drive to his girlfriend Donna, pick her up and tell her he'd won the lottery. Unfortunately, he was unable to rent a limo at such short notice, so he drove himself home - presumably not even annoyed at the traffic jam. Big plans: Mainella and his girlfriend are planning to have a much more elaborate wedding than they could have afforded before the win . 'I called six different companies that day and no one could send a limo on such short notice so I called her at work and told her to come home right away.' Mainella greeted Donna at the front door and asked, 'Do you believe in me?' When Donna said that she did, he told her 'You're gonna be happy for the rest of your life.' Mainella has elected to take his $5 million in 20 installments of $172,000 per year. The father of three intends to use the money on a wedding for himself and Donna and to fund his retirement.

Familiar faces: Joan Rivers posted this photo on Thursday and considering how she tried to be stealth while taking the photo, it seems unlikely that she went on to chat with the disgraced governor afterwards . Rivers' spokeswoman Judy Katz confirmed to MailOnline that the run-in took place at JFK on Friday morning. It seems unlikely that they chatted given the stealth nature of her photo. Rivers, who most recently identified as a Republican during a January interview, is known for her barbed critiques of fashion so it comes as no surprise that she used his clothing as a way into an insult. Spitzer has been seen on a regular basis in recent months after his relationship with his former campaign manager Lis Smith was revealed, leading to his formal split from his wife Silda. Spitzer, 54, and Smith, 31, were photographed sneaking into her SoHo apartment before he filed for divorce and then were later seen visiting her mother on Christmas. More interested in each other: Eliot Spitzer and his girlfriend Lis Smith attended their third Knicks game in as many months on Monday (pictured) as they watched the home team play the Philadelphia 76ers . They have since put their relationship on even more public display by attending a number of Knicks games at Madison Square Garden over the past two months. For her part, Rivers isn't above using a photo stunt to help generate some publicity. She mysteriously stormed out of a QVC pre-Oscars party with her face covered in cake. It was revealed later that Miss Piggy, the Muppet, was behind the gag as the two got into a staged fight over their competing lines that landed the 80-year-old comedienne in a strategically placed wedding cake. Stunt: Rivers, 80, ran out of this QVC pre-Oscars party on February 28 minutes after arriving because Miss Piggy pushed her into a wedding cake . Rivers has carried the feud over to Twitter. Christie's auction house just announced that they will be selling a lot of furniture, fine art and decorative objects from Rivers' country home in Connecticut. She sold the 760-acre estate for $4.4million last year and now she is unloading more than 150 items that once filled the house. An unspecified portion of the sale, which will take place on April 1 and 2nd, will be donated to God's Love We Deliver, a charity that provides meals for homebound and ill New Yorkers.","Comedienne ran into the disgraced former Governor at New York's JFK airport on Friday .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 12:33 EST, 14 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:02 EST, 14 March 2014 . An extraordinary collection of aerial photographs of World War One trenches has come to light nearly a century after the conflict. The images were collected by Sergeant Alex Statters, who served in France and helped to draw up maps of the battlefield on behalf of the Allied forces. They show how the trenches snaked across the countryside, which was pock-marked with hundreds of shell craters from the bombardment of the two sides. The photographs form part of a scrapbook compiled by Sgt Statters during the war, which also includes the telegram announcing the end of the conflict and a signed portrait of Winston Churchill. The book does not provide details of where and when the pictures were taken or of Sgt Statters service. He appears to have been a Royal Engineer (RE). Sapper were responsible for using balloons and aeroplanes to carry out reconnaissance missions above the trenches - the planes being flown by pilots from Army air units, and when it was formed, the Royal Air Force. The missions were fraught with danger and technical difficulty. As well as being targets for the Germans who would fire from the ground and attack from the air, taking pictures involved holding the camera firmly and hoping that the exposure was quick enough not to be shaken. Photographs had to have sufficient resolution to be of use to Royal Artillery gunnery crews on the ground, meaning that plate glass film was initially used. As technology advanced, lighter cameras were brought in, but compared to modern technology, they were still large, heavy and difficult to use. One of the documents on auction along with Sgt Statters' collection of pictures names a 'topo' - 'topography' unit, suggesting that he was part of one. These units were responsible for plotting where British batteries would be sited, and were part of the RE's Field Survey Companies, which produced reports which allowed Royal Artillery intelligence officers to plot both where to site their batteries, and where enemy guns were positioned. As the war progressed, more and more men were involved technology advanced, and the scale of the RE's operation expanded, so that by July 1918, the companies were upgraded to battalions. Artillery had become the deadliest killer in the trenches rapidly and dominated the war, meaning that assessing the impact of shells on the enemy, the accuracy of aim, and the location of enemy positions was crucial. It is unclear if Sgt Statters flew himself or acquired the pictures in the course of his work. The book is going up for auction next month and is expected to fetch around £2,500. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Aerial view: the location and timing of this view is unknown but it shows something of the scale of trench systems which were used by both the Allies and the Germans. There is very little evidence of shell damage, suggesting that these are newly entrenched areas - which could either by the start of the war, or more likely towards the very end when movement had resumed. They could also be training trenches, although their scale makes that unlikely. On the left of the picture, the trenches have a regular pattern but angular sections jutting out. This was intended to allow for sniper fire to protect against an incursion from no man's land. Across the top of the picture is a lengthy communications trench, which zig-zags to make sniper fire more difficult, and also to make it more difficult for artillery fire to rake it. It connects to other what are more likely to be front line trenches, which are in two rows running from top to bottom of the picture. The trenches are dug in a pattern lik . Damage: This photograph shows how the countryside was covered in shell craters from the aerial bombardment campaign carried out by both sides. The picture is one of the few which has information on it, dated 24 June 1917 top right corner. The date is shortly after the Battle of Messines had been launched. it is not known if this is in that area, but the scale of damage suggests a heavy bombardments.The remains of the roads which covered the area can still be seen. Close-up: It is hard to grasp the scale of trench warfare, but each section of the zig zag would have been between five and ten feet long. Zig zags were protective: if an enemy party managed to enter the trench, they could not fire down its length, and a soldier could defend the corner as long as ammunition - or more primitive weapons - held out. But the number of shell hols shows the constant danger soldiers were under. it also suggests the area is the very front line - the commucations trenches curve back from it towards the left of the photograph, but do not appear to project much further. Some short trenches extend beyond the apparent front line, which seems to run from top to bottom. They may be the remains of older workings. Intricate: This photograph is dated 18 March 1918. At the time both sides were experiencing something of a calm period - but only for a few more days. On 21 March, the Germans launched their Spring Offensive. Fortified in numbers thanks to Russia being out of the war, and using newly developed tactics of stormtroopers moving rapidly, they broke through the Allies positions, overran the trenches, and opened a war of movement. In the end, however, the Spring Offensive was seen by many historians as the Germans' undoing as the country did not have the resources to support the newly mobile armies, and their supply chains suffered. This photograph shows how trneches were built with forward-projecting sections like the tops of medieval battlements, and also built in rows. The presence of the corner at the top centre of the picture suggests some form of change of direction in the trenches, possibly due to change in the topography - the section here is built on flat ground. This picture is one of the few with specific geographical details. It appears to be taken in the air above German positions near Cambrai, in the Somme, and Arras, in the Nord Pas de Calais. At the top left is an arrow pointing towards the Bois de Bourlon, which is around three miles south-west of Arras. To the right is the village of Anneux, which is just outside Cambrai. In the front is the Hindeburg Line, a German defensive system which ran south from Arras. It was built in the winter of 1916 and 1917 and designed to hold off an expected offensive which the Germans believed would happen in the summer of 1917. The Hindenburg Line in fact largely held and although the Germans lost land in front of it (in this picture the fields in the foreground) it appeared to prevent a larger breakthrough by the Allies. The photograph is date 17 August 1917, by which time British offensives in the area had largely ended following the Second battle of Bullecourt. However there were further offensives after this photograph and in November 1917 Anneux was taken  by the 62nd (West Riding) Division on 20 and 21 November 1917. Anneux remained in Allied hands until the following 6 December. It was recaptured on 27 September 1918, by the 57th (West Lancashire) and 63rd (Royal Naval) Divisions, acting with the 52nd (Lowland) and the 1st and 4th Canadian Divisions. It is today home to a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery, with the majority of soldier buried there from the Canadian army. This photograph has no geography or date, and shows both trenches and what appear to be heavy gun emplacements (top centre). The lack of shell damage and the small number of trenches suggests this is behind the front lines, where heavy guns would be emplaced. it is impossible to tell if it was a photograph taken to show German positions or British ones. The Royal Engineers photographed both to allow Royal Artillery intelligence officers to have a complete picture of the battlefield - meaning risky aerial missions with cumbersome cameras. Another undated image suggests positions behind the front lines, as the heaviest shell damage is concentrated at the bottom left. Lengthy communication trenches were needed to bring forward supplies, and although World War One was not a war of movement, the shifting positions of the fronts meant that not all were used all the time. Roads remained crucial - the white chalk road is typical of the north of France or Belgium, while the fields seem unused. It is unclear what the dark sections along the centre represent - it could be something printed on to the pictures to show planned fortifications, or the beginnings of works on the ground. The sheer scale of bombardment, together with the trenches on the right, suggests that this is a section which has recently been the subject of action. The trenches on the right are a front line, although the lack of clear information means whose - and where - is not known. The pictures are marked (top left) with coding which would allow the Royal Engineers and Royal Artillery to assemble an overview of the battlefield. The pictures also show how roads - and in this case what may be the canal of the Somme, running from centre left to bottom right - survived bombardment, At the top of the photograph, however, the intense bombardment means the chalk underneath the topsoil is all that can be seen. Artillery units wanted to rain shells down on trenches, not elsewhere, but accuracy was limited. Shellfire became the main weapon of the war and each side became evenly matched in their ability to produce weapons and ammunition. Historic: Another object in the scrapbook is the telegram announcing the Armistice and the end of the First World War. The underlining of 'Topo' suggests that it was sent to the topographic section of a Royal Engineers Field Survey Battallion, which appears to be where Sgt Statters served. The signal was sent from the headquarters of the British Third Army, which in November 1918 was under the command of General Sir Julian (later Lord) Byng.

Washington has lifted its ban on British oil company BP bidding for federal government contracts in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico disaster in 2010, the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history. BP said it had reached agreement with America's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which will also see it withdraw a lawsuit challenging the suspension and open the way for it to enter into new leases in the Gulf. Britain backed efforts to lift the ban and in December filed a statement to a U.S. court considering the case that it 'may have been excessive'. Fatal disaster: The 2011 Deepwater Horizon accident killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico . BP had been suspended from performing any new government work in America since November 2012, after it agreed to plead guilty and pay a $4.5 billion (£2.8 billion) fine for criminal charges over the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The oil rig accident killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.BP has been banned for 16 months from leasing more offshore oil and gas properties and renewing fuel contracts with the U.S. military. But under the new agreement, 25 BP . entities and its Houston-based oil production and exploration arm have . been cleared to secure new government contracts. For five years, BP will have to abide by a . series of ethics, safety and other requirements. An independent auditor . will also verify its compliance with the deal. It comes just before the . U.S. Department of Interior will offer more than 40 million acres for oil and . gas exploration and development in the Gulf of Mexico in March lease . sales. The company said the lifting of the embargo cleared it to enter into new deepwater leases in the Gulf of Mexico. The deal also means that, for five years, the company will have to abide by a series of ethics, safety and other requirements, while an independent auditor will also verify its compliance with the deal. The company's prospects are seen as important to UK jobs and pension funds. John Minge, chairman and president of BP . America, said: 'After a lengthy negotiation, BP is pleased to have . reached this resolution, which we believe to be fair and reasonable. 'Today's agreement will allow America's largest energy investor to again compete for federal contracts and leases.' Dark clouds of smoke and fire emerge as oil burns during a controlled fire in the Gulf of Mexico, May 6, 2010 . A fire aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig raged for days before sinking . A team of federal regulators concluded that BP has to bear the ultimate responsibility for the spill . Senate Energy Committee chair Sen. Mary Landrieu, praised the agreement. She said: 'BP . has rightly been held responsible in a court of law and should continue . to make whole the individuals and businesses that were impacted by the . oil spill, but barring them from entering new contracts on top of that . amounted to double jeopardy and set a terrible precedent that I hope . will not be repeated. 'The . good news is that BP will now be able to participate in next week's . lease sale that will bring much-needed revenue to Louisiana and other . oil-producing states along the Gulf Coast."" Upsetting: A brown Pelican covered in oil sits on the beach at East Grand Terre Island along the Louisiana coast six months after the explosion . Disaster: Thick crude oil from the spill being collected near Port Sulphur, Louisiana in 2010 . However Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen's Energy Program, criticized the move for letting BP 'off the hook.' He said the company 'has failed to prove that it is a responsible contractor deserving of lucrative taxpayer deals'. BP continues to grapple with the costs of the spill, with annual results last month showing the total charge recognised to date stood at $42.7 billion (£26.2 billion). It is appealing against a court ruling over bogus claims on its compensation scheme and is asking for an injunction 'to prevent awards to claimants whose losses are not traceable to the spill'. Stock watch: BP shares have not recovered since the Deepwater disaster in April 2010 . Shares rose around 0.5 per cent on a day when the wider FTSE 100 Index headed downwards in the wake of overnight gloom on world markets. The April 2010 spill occurred after .

Its Invelox turbine, pictured, directs winds into a funnel and through a tube to the turbine's generator on the ground. Sheerwind claim it produces 600% more energy than the traditional designs . Conventional wind turbines use turbine generator systems mounted on top of a tower. Invelox, instead, funnels wind energy to ground-based generators. Instead . of catching energy from the wind as it passes through the . blades of a rotor, Invelox captures wind through a funnel. This wind is directed through a . tapering passageway that naturally accelerates its flow. The stream of kinetic energy that is created then drives a generator. By channelling this wind through a passage that narrows at the end it creates a ‘jet effect’, which increases the wind’s velocity, but lowers the pressure. This technique creates kinetic energy and is called the Venturi Effect. This kinetic energy turns the generator. Sheerwind claims that due to this unique Venturi-based system, the turbine works with wind speeds as low as 2mph. It can also produce 600 per cent more electrical energy (kWh) than blade systems by expanding the range of speeds at which it can operate.

Supporters of the British driver will argue that the comment should not be taken out of context and that Hamilton was expressing his confidence that Schumacher will wake up and make a full recovery. Hamilton, 29, said: 'As a young driver who watched Michael through his early days, and championship wins, we - as Formula One - will carry him through the whole of the season. 'I am in touch with his people, so I am fortunate to get first-hand news of what is happening and we are all waiting for him to wake up and show those positive signs. 'He's a legend in the sport, you know, who has achieved so much, a very motivated individual. 'So I feel like all things happen for a reason, I think that this is an experience that will really show his character and depth and even more so than any other experiences he's had.'

Reflective: Lewis Hamilton insists his thoughts will be with Michael Schumacher throughout the F1 campaign . Defence: Some Twitter users defended Hamilton, saying his comments were read out of context . A matter of interpretation: Another Twitter user said the argument among fans was a storm in a teacup . Hamilton's comments are in contrast to the actions of some his fellow racers. Reigning F1 champion Sebastian Vettel is paying tribute to Schumacher by driving in this weekend's season opener wearing a helmet with the legend's signature just below the visor. Drivers Felipe Massa and Jules Bianchi have also said they will follow suit by wearing helmets emblazoned with the initials MS. Schumacher was placed in an induced . coma after undergoing two operations to remove blood clots from his . brain in the wake of his skiing accident on December 29. He remains in a waking-up process at the University of Grenoble hospital in France. In a statement issued on behalf of the 45-year-old's family, the F1 star's agent said: 'We are, and remain confident, Michael will pull through and will wake up.' 'There sometimes are small, encouraging signs, but we also know this is the time to be very patient. 'Michael . has suffered severe injuries. It is very hard to comprehend for all of . us that Michael, who had overcome a lot of precarious situations in the . past, has been hurt so terribly in such a banal situation.

A High Court judge has asked government officials in three countries for help re-uniting two sisters, Selina Ali (left), three, and her sister Hana (right), who is nearly two, with their mother . Lawyers representing Ms Wawrzak, a hotel housekeeper from Sosnowiec, Poland, said Mr Ali, a mechanic, had returned to England alone. They said the girls were thought to be living with members of his family in Algiers - and said it was hoped that a relative might bring them back to England. But lawyers said the girls might have problems obtaining travel documentation which would allow them to re-enter the UK because of the nationalities of the parents. Mrs Justice Hogg asked British officials at the UK Border Agency and the Foreign Office plus officials in the Polish and Algerian embassies in London to do what they could to help. She also ruled that the youngsters’ plight could be reported - in the hope that publicity would help get them home. ‘I will give leave for publicity,’ said Mrs Justice Hogg. ‘I am very concerned about these little girls.’ Mrs Justice Hogg was told at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court (pictured) that the situation is in breach of court orders that they should live with their Polish mother, Edyta Wawrzak, 30 .

'I think we basically got a massive foundation in FP2 and I can build on that in FP3 and then see where we end up in qualifying,' said Hamilton. 'It would have been great to have had FP1 but I got enough running thankfully in FP2 so I feel quite comfortable with the car. 'I felt I was really on the back foot already.

Pauline Harrison a Merseyside PCSO, tripped over a fence on a 999 call and received a £4,000 payout while her lawyers took more than £57,500 . Lawyers who won £4,000 compensation for a PCSO who hurt her knee while investigating a burglary also pocketed £57,000 in legal fees, it emerged yesterday. Pauline Harrison, 53, was responding to a 999 call of a break-in at a derelict school when she fell over a 3ft wooden fence. Her ‘no win, no fee’ lawyers, Lucas Law, settled the controversial case out of court in December, but last night it emerged that the Macclesfield-based firm has claimed £57,589 for costs – a staggering 14 times the amount of Mrs Harrison’s payout. Campaigners last night condemned the fees, which will be paid by insurers of the owners of the former school where Mrs Harrison was injured. They said the fees were a ‘sad’ reflection of the burgeoning compensation culture in the UK, which is having  a knock-on effect for the general  public in rising insurance premiums. Dia Chakravarty, the political director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is a sad truth of our absurd compensation culture that the only real winners are ambulance-chasing lawyers.’ A source close to the case added: ‘The amount of costs these lawyers have put in for is absolutely outrageous. The British public is paying the price for these ridiculous bills in higher insurance premiums, which are going up and up and up.’ The incident happened in 2009 when the police community support officer, who serves with Merseyside Police, responded to reports of youths on the roof of four-storey Sunshine House, a former school for the blind owned by property development firm Lightflask. Previously, yobs had lit fires in the grounds, so the firm had secured its perimeter with a 6ft iron fence, except for a small wooden fence closing off a gateway at the front of the site. Miss Harrison said she suffered ‘soft tissue damage’ to her right knee as she tried to leave the property in Birkdale, near Southport. Derelict: Merseyside PCSO Pauline Harrison, 53, injured her knee tripping over a 3ft high wooden fence while responding to reports of a break-in at this former school in Birkdale, in 2009 . In court papers, Miss Harrison said Lightflask was negligent because it had allowed the wooden fence to become a ‘danger and a trap to persons lawfully entering and exiting the premises’. The former dog trainer also said the company had failed to properly warn her about the fencing or erect warning signs. Her decision to sue was condemned by her own police force when it was revealed in November. A spokesman for Lightflask said that they could not discuss details of the case because of confidentiality issues, but previously said it was ‘crazy’ that members of the public could be sued by police going about their duties. ‘Risks cannot be removed from every situation,’ the spokesman said. ‘It’s crazy that claims can be made by police officers in their line of work. The nature of their job is risky. ‘Generally speaking, the problem is not necessarily with claimants but with the law firms chasing these cases. Often they are making more than the claimants are receiving in damages.’ Miss Harrison’s solicitor, Jared  Bailey, yesterday declined to comment. Last year Home Secretary Theresa May criticised ‘frivolous’ claims being made by officers which she said were ‘not the sort of attitude’ they should exhibit. Her comments came after WPC Kelly Jones, 33, threatened to sue a garage owner in Thetford, Norfolk, after she tripped over a kerb while investigating a burglary. She later dropped her claim.","Pauline Harrison, 53, fell over a 3ft wooden fence responding to a 999 call about a break-in at derelict school in Birkdale, Merseyside .

A man who had his penis chopped off by a gipsy gang has been named locally as Kelvin 'Kelly' Hewitt. The 40-year-old was mutilated in a horrific attack in the early hours of Thursday morning in Middlesbrough. He was rushed to hospital and put into an induced coma, but is now conscious and in a stable condition, police confirmed. Attack: It's believed that Kelvin 'Kelly' Hewitt (pictured) is the man who had his penis cut off and subsequently placed in an induced coma . Affection: Mr Hewitt's Facebook profile picture shows him kissing a blonde woman . Possible connection: The man was attacked near a gipsy campsite on John Boyle Road on Teesside . Motive: It's thought that the gipsy gang (not necessarily connected to the picture) cut off the man's penis for sleeping with one of their girlfriends . Standstill: Police closed a busy dual carriageway to hunt for a man's penis after he was discovered severely injured at the side of the road . Distressed: The 40-year-old was discovered in a distressed state on the side of the A66 dual carriageway in Middlesbrough on Thursday morning, Cleveland Police have confirmed . Probe: A 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault in relation to the incident and was released on bail . Police brought a busy dual carriageway . to a standstill to hunt for Mr Hewitt's penis after he was discovered . severely injured at the side of an A-road. Mr Hewitt is thought to be a father-of-five although it's not clear who the mother is. On social networking sites Leanne Trewhitt, appeared to identify herself as one of his children. She wrote on Facebook: 'Think I've felt every emotion there possibly is today, thanks for all your kind messages my phone hasn't stopped. My dad's stable now just hoping for a speedy recovery.' Her friends flooded her page with get-well messages after she posted the above note. Mr Hewitt indicated he had a previous relationship with a lady named on social networking sites as Carla Hill. However, it is unclear if she is the mother of his children or if they are still a couple. Cleveland police said: 'The victim remains in hospital and is now conscious. Officers visited him today but were unable to carry out a detailed interview. They hope to speak to him today or tomorrow to establish exactly how his injuries were sustained. Inquiries are on-going.' Mr Hewitt was discovered in a distressed state on the side of the A66 . dual carriageway. He often stays at gipsy campsites in Middlesbrough, including Haven Travellers Site, according to his Facebook page, and recently commented on a meal he ate at a McDonald's on the A66. Facebook comment: Mr Hewitt recently posted a message about a meal he had at McDonald's on the A66, close to where he was attacked . He joked on March 3 about dreading going to work. Dr Raj Persad, a consultant urologist, told MailOnline that a new penis could be constructed even if the original tissue is lost. He said: 'The best hope is that doctors have kept the tissue in a viable way so the penis can be reconnected. If the tissue is no longer viable, the options are limited. 'It may be possible to make a phallus – rather like that created in gender reassignment surgery. Here, tissue expanders can be used to create a flap of tissue that can be rolled into a phallus. The urethra would also have to be reconstructed.' A . member of staff at Asda close to where the incident happened said he . heard that a man had suffered the horrendous injury to his groin. He added: 'A few of the Asda staff have been talking and apparently it was some gipsy men doing it to another guy after they found out he had slept with one of their girlfriends. 'I don't know his name but that seems to be what I have heard.' Although police at the time would only say that the . man had suffered serious injuries and wounds to his groin area, around eight officers were seen combing a grass verge at the side of the road, while tape was used to seal off a section of the carriageway. It's believed that they were searching for the missing body part. Officers search the verge of the dual carriageway for the man's organ and other forensic evidence . A member of staff at Asda close to where the incident happened said he heard the victim had suffered a horrendous injury to his groin . Road block: This stretch of the A66 was sealed off by police investigating the incident . The road closed some time between 4.20am . and 9am and was open again by midday. The police closed east bound . carriageway first while they searched, then west bound. A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault in relation to the incident was held in police custody on Thursday. He was bailed pending further enquiries. Mr Hewitt was found at 4.50am and was taken to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. Ambulance: Mr Hewitt was found at 4.50am with serious injuries and was taken to hospital . Investigation: Officers were said to be 'keeping an open mind' as to how the man was injured . 'The road closures were required as part of the investigation into how the man received his injuries,' said a police spokesman. 'This . is necessary so that officers can look for anything which may shed . light on how he became injured or his direction of travel.' The police had taped off a Vauxhall Zafira on a nearby gipsy site. He added: 'If the road was not closed any evidence could be lost or destroyed.' 'Investigations are at a very early stage.' Missing: It is understood that his penis had been cut off and was missing, prompting officers to close sections of the route in order to search for it . The spokesman added: 'Officers are keeping an open mind as to how he received his injuries and key to this will be speaking to the man himself when they are able to do so.' A second man who did not wish to be named said: 'I work on an industrial site close to where it happened. 'When I came into work this morning it was bedlam because the whole place was at a standstill. 'Nobody has told us what has happened, we heard there had been a body found and that there had been a stabbing but these could just be rumours.' Mr Nim Christopher, a leading expert in penile reconstruction at University College London Hospitals, told MailOnline: ‘For a complete penile reconstruction, a procedure called a free flap phalloplasty is performed. This involves taking a chunk of tissue still intact (in terms of nerves, veins, arteries) from another part of the body. This is then rolled into a tube like a sausage roll with a pipe inside it for the urethra.’ Parts of the body where skin may be taken from are the arm or the thigh. The tissue is then transplanted onto the groin area and the nerves, arteries and veins are connected. Cosmetic surgery is then performed to give the transplanted penis the appearance of one that has been circumcised. The whole procedure usually takes three operations and sensation – if it returns at all – can take a long time while the nerves heal. If a man wishes to be sexually active, he can undergo surgery to have a ‘penis pump’ device implanted. Here, two cylinders are placed either side in the tissue and these are connected to a pump in the scrotum. Squeezing the pump fills the cylinders with fluid kept in a reservoir in the abdomen. This type of surgery can be very successful and save sexual relations when all else has failed. But there are some risks attached to the operation, though, including infection and damage to the penis. A man who had been walking his dog through the area when police started closing the roads said: 'From what I could gather there had been some sort of stabbing. 'I asked an officer what was going on and he said there was no risk to the public but someone had been seriously injured, they said it was just an individual incident though.' A man working in nearby ScS Sofas said: 'There has been a heavy police presence in the area all day, they have been walking around the area and generally chatting to public. 'Lots of people have said there had been a stabbing but that they had heard it from someone else so it was probably just rumours. 'Whatever it was it must have been pretty serious for them to have closed the roads for so long, it was a nightmare getting into work this morning. 'People have been coming in and asking if we knew what had happened but we had no idea either. 'I instantly thought it must have been a road accident seeing as they closed the roads.' A lady taking her shopping from Asda said: 'I know there has been a man hurt but there hasn't been much else said on the matter. 'There . is a lot of gossip about a stabbing but it could just be rumours with a . lot of people speculating over what it could be and coming to their own . conclusions.' Two community support officers who were patrolling said a man had been seriously injured earlier today. They said 'no comment' when asked if a man's penis had been chopped off. All road closures have now been lifted.","40-year-old found in distressed state at the side of the A66 in Middlesbrough .

Mr Jeal, who lived alone and was not reported missing, took the number . 594 bus from Wadebridge to Truro, arriving in the bus station at 6.14pm. He was seen walking towards the public toilets at The Leats and was last seen at 6.36pm in Boscawen Street, Truro. Officers are now trying to establish where Mr Jeal, from Wadebridge, went after that and how he travelled to Perranporth. Mr . Thorne added: 'We are keen to speak to anyone who saw Alan on Monday 24 . February, whether walking, on public transport or in a car. 'We . have traced his movements up until 6.36pm in Truro city centre but we . need the public's help in establishing where he went after that.'

In his new book, Spanish historian Fernando García Sanz tells how Bedlington turned traitor after being recruited by her Austro-Hungarian husband Gunter Hopf. Traitor: British ballerina Elizabeth Bedlington, who performed in Spain under the name La Titanesca during World War One, was a spy working for the Germans, according to a new book . Bedlington was later identified as a 'mule' by allied forces, but managed to escape arrest, and remained in Spain until her death, according to a report in the Times newspaper. According to the book, the Italian secret service identified her as a 'mule', and she was barred from travelling to the country. Originally from London, Bedlington is described as a Mata Hari-type figure, referring to the Dutch courtesan who was executed by French troops for feeding information to the Germans.

Twenty British soldiers killed during the First World War were today laid to rest near the battlefield where they died nearly 100 years ago. The bodies were discovered in 2010 near during clearance work for new buildings near Vendin-le-Vieil, north of Arras in France. All of the men died at the Battle of Loos in 1915, and they were buried at the Dud's Corner, a cemetery run by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission located in the town of Loos-en-Gohelle. Ceremony: Private William McAleer and 19 other soldiers were today laid to rest in France a century after they died in the Battle of Loos . Atmospheric: The ceremony at the Loos British Cemetery took place in thick fog . Duty: The soldiers wore kilts as they carried the coffin of Pte McAleer, who was born in Fife . Pallbearers: The private's coffin was carried by a group of soldiers from The 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland . The only one to have been identified by name is Private William McAleer, 22, from the 7th Battalion the Royal Scottish Fusiliers, whose step-great-nephew Stephen McLeod was present at the ceremony. Among the other soldiers who died during the fierce battle were a Northumberland Fusilier, another six Royal Scottish Fusiliers and a member of the York and Lancaster Regiment. The 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland accorded military honours to the men as they were buried, with the unidentified soldiers commemorated as 'Known unto God'. Pte McAleer's coffin was given his own burial plot, with his headstone reading '13766, Private W. McAleer Royal Scots Fusiliers, 26th September 1915, age 22'. The remainder were buried in six other plots side by side. Sombre: A large crowd turned out to pay their respects to Pte McAleer and his unidentified comrades . Laid to rest: The soldiers' bodies were found in 2010 during construction work after lying in an unmarked plot for 95 years . In thick fog, a piper led six bearers as they carried Pte McAleer's Union flag-draped coffin topped with a wreath, belt and cap past the crowds and the burial plots of hundreds of other fallen soldiers. A military firing party fired a salute during the service and the Last Post was played. Mr McLeod, a former Black Watch soldier from Cowdenbeath, wore a Tam o' Shanter hat and a Northern Ireland medal to the service. He said his grandmother had talked about Pte McAleer, but added that he did not previously know how his ancestor had died. 'I knew about his existence and knew he died in the First World War, but I didn't know his body wasn't found,' the father of two said. Moving: The burial was arranged by the Ministry of Defence and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission . Wreath: A mourner dressed in black carries dozens of poppies in tribute to the fallen soldiers . 'That was news to myself when the military put out an appeal for his descendants to come forward. It was my cousin who heard the appeal, who in turn contacted my brother. 'To come to the Commonwealth and show my respect, especially as a former soldier, to those who have fallen, is a great honour. 'But to be able to come here in the centenary year and show respect to kith and kin is unique. It's unfortunate that we have the other 19 soldiers unidentified. 'It would have been nice if their descendants were able to show their respects.' Family: Stephen McLeod, the step-great-nephew of Pte McAleer, was present to watch his ancestor buried . Contemplation: Mr McLeod, a former soldier with the Black Watch, said he had not known how Pte McAleer died . Respect: Mr McLeod was handed the personal effects of Pte McAleer during the burial ceremony . The Battle of Loos featured . the first British use of poison gas, and followed a four-day artillery . bombardment along a six-and-a-half-mile front. The . attack led by Sir Douglas Haig happened simultaneously as the French . attacked the German lines at Champagne and at Vimy Ridge in Arras. But . the Germans were able to successfully hold their position on both . fronts, helped by a second line of trenches built six miles behind the . front lines. On September 25 1915, Pte McAleer's battalion had reached Hill 70 to the east of Loos and dug in behind the crest line. They fought off a German counter-attack during the night before being ordered to attack a German redoubt the following morning. Although . they entered the German trenches, after fierce hand-to-hand fighting . they were forced to retreat to their start positions. They were then subjected to heavy . artillery bombardment which led to their withdrawal later after two . unsuccessful bids by 21 Division to join up had failed. Piper: A musician from the battalion plays a lament for the dead during the service . Sacred ground: The Dud's Corner graveyard in Loos-en-Gohelle, near the site of the battle . Resting place: The names of many of those buried in the cemetery are unknown, and they are marked as 'Known unto God' Records . of the 7th Battalion the Royal Scots Fusiliers showed that in just two . days of battle, 69 died, 258 were wounded and 181 were missing. Peter . Francis, of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, told MailOnline: . ‘These casualties were discovered at a construction site of a new prison . being built. ‘During . work preparing the ground for that, they found what appeared to be a . battleground grave, which also contained some 30 German casualties. From . the location and regiments involved, initial indications were that . these were from the Battle of Loos in September 1915. ‘The remains were recovered by the . Commission and kept safe in our mortuary, near Arras. Then the Ministry . of Defence got involved. ‘They . have a unit called the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre – they . deal with present-day military casualties but also historical cases as . well. They began the lengthy task of looking at whether or not they can identify these individuals.’ Memorial: A card of remembrance for the private issued by his mother after his death in September 1915 . Identification: Pte McAleer was identified thanks to the metal tag he was buried with . Pte McAleer - born in Leven, Fife, as . the son of a miner - was identified thanks to a metal identification . tag which he happened to be carrying at the time of his death. 'This . is slightly unusual because British soldiers didn’t have metal ID tags . during the First World War, so this was something he'd got himself,' Mr . Francis said. ‘In 1916 . they brought in the two tags, but they were made of a compressed . cardboard, not metal - but soldiers often brought their own metal ones.’ The Loos Memorial near where the soldiers went into action carries the names of more than 20,000 missing from the battle. More . than 950,000 British and Commonwealth military personnel died in the . First World War, with a further 2.2 million armed forces members wounded . in action. Ruins of Loos: The battle featured the first British use of poison gas, and followed a four-day artillery bombardment along a six-and-a-half-mile front . Devastation: The attack in Loos happened simultaneously as the French attacked the German lines at Champagne and at Vimy Ridge in Arras . Of those killed, some 600,000 have a marked grave but there remain more than 300,000 British and Commonwealth personnel with no known grave. This year, the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre will conduct more ceremonies for the remains of a further 43 British soldiers killed in the First World War across mainland Europe. The events will be attended by serving members of the fallen's regiment, or its successor, and the regimental association, senior military officers and, where possible, relatives of the soldier. In October, 15 soldiers from the Yorks and Lancashire Regiment who are believed to have died in battle around Beauchamp Ligny, France, will be buried. And six soldiers, believed to have been serving with the Lancashire Fusiliers and Kings Own Regiments, are to be buried in early September at Prowse Point Cemetery in Belgium. In addition, a soldier from the Welsh Guards and an officer from the Oxford and Buckinghamshire Regiment will be buried in separate events on dates to be decided later this year.","The 20 soldiers were killed in the Battle of Loos in September 1915 and their graves were lost for a century .

There will be ‘no going back’ if Scotland votes for indepdenence, David Cameron warned today. The Prime Minister said the country faces a ‘monumental battle to keep our United Kingdom together’ ahead of September’s referendum. And he insisted it was a ‘myth’ that warnings about the impact on business, the currency and the EU were empty ‘scaremongering’. Prime Minister David Cameron warned voters there is 'no going back' if they vote for independence . Mr Cameron said a Yes vote would mean 'total separation' with no 'second chances' Mr Cameron hinted at more devolved powers for Scotland if voters reject independent on September 18 . In a speech to the Scottish Conservative party spring conference in Edinburgh, Mr Cameron hinted that the Scottish Parliament could gain more power over tax if voters reject independence. He insisted that a No vote on September 18 is ‘not the end of line’ for devolution but stopped short of spelling out any detail on what those powers could be. In his 20-minute speech, the Prime Minister insisted there will be ‘no going back’ if voters say Yes to independence. He praised the ‘spirit’ of the party in Scotland, which has just one MP at Westminster. And he drew on recent interventions from major businesses, such as BP and Shell, in the referendum debate. He also vowed to tackle accusations of ‘scaremongering’ over the country's future, saying he wants to ‘take that myth apart’. Mr Cameron warned that a Yes vote would tear apart the UK family of nations . Dire warnings of the impact on jobs and the economy could not be dismissed as scaremongering by the Yes campaign, Mr Cameron insisted . ‘Six months from now the day will dawn, the polling booths will open, the voters will come out and the people of Scotland will decide - stay or go, stick with the UK or walk away,’ he said. ‘If the Scottish people vote Yes in September, then Scotland will become an independent country, there will be no going back, no second chances.’ He added: ‘We face a monumental battle to keep our United Kingdom together.’ An opinion poll this week put support for independence at its highest level for more than six months. The Survation poll suggests 39.3 per cent will vote for independence, compared with 47.6 per cent who said they want Scotland to remain part of the UK. Mr Cameron, who praised Tory leader in Scotland Ruth Davidson, added: ‘Let me be absolutely clear: a vote for “no” is not a vote for “no change”. We are committed to making devolution work better still. Earlier Mr Cameron had lunch with staff at Scottish Widows in Edinburgh, . The Prime Minister queued up in the canteen for his lunch before discussing independence with employees . ‘Not because we want to give Alex Salmond a consolation prize if Scotland votes No, but because it's the right thing to do. ‘Giving the Scottish Parliament greater responsibility for raising more of the money it spends - that's what Ruth believes, and I believe it too. ‘So here's the re-cap: vote yes, that is total separation. ‘Vote no, that can mean further devolution - more power to the Scottish people and their parliament, but with the crucial insurance policy that comes with being part of the UK.’ But the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign group said the promise is a sham. Chief executive Blair Jenkins said: ‘The trouble is that we have heard it all before and it is clear from what the Prime Minister said today in his speech that he cannot and will not guarantee more powers for the Scottish Parliament. ‘With Labour also hopelessly split on more powers, the message to take from all of this is very clear: that the only way the people of Scotland can be guaranteed to get the powers they want and the country needs is to vote Yes on September 18.’","Prime Minister insists warnings from business about risks are very real .

Hollywood legend Oliver Reed ‘liked young girls’, the Max Clifford trial sensationally heard today. The millionaire PR guru claimed to represent the Oliver Twist star to a teenage recruitment consultant - and said he had to cover up the actor’s controversial sexual preferences, jurors heard. The consultant, just 19 at the time, said Clifford made the shock revelations during a meeting about a PA job at his Bond Street offices. She said: ‘He said it was working as his PA and as part of that it would be looking after his list of celebrities, taking care of their needs. ‘He named a lot of celebrities, and one that I remember is Oliver Reed. ‘I was very young and didn’t really know who the other ones were very much. I remember clearly Oliver Reed. ‘He said that some of his clients, and specifically named Oliver Reed, had sexual preferences and he explained that Oliver Reed liked young girls. ‘And that as a publicist, this was problematic for him and it would be part of the role I was there for, to protect the clients. ‘He just said they had different sexual preferences and I remember him specifically saying about Oliver Reed, that he liked young girls.’ She said that very quickly Clifford began interviewing her for the job and quizzing her about how she could help ‘protect Oliver Reed’. Oliver Reed, who starred in Oliver Twist died from a sudden heart attack during a break from filming Gladiator in Valletta, Malta in 1999 when he was 61 years old . The woman said: ‘I do remember thinking it was a very glamorous job and it all sounded very exciting being involved in celebrities and celebrities’ affairs. ‘I remember thinking it was something about helping them not to get into trouble. ‘I offered up an idea of how that might be done as part of my interview. What I suggested was we could find girls for him that looked young but weren’t young, and were of legal age. ‘It was only afterwards that I realised exactly what I was suggesting - that somehow I might have been suggesting that we could procure girls for people. ‘I meant just surround him with available people that looked younger.’ After the meeting, said to have taken place in 1978 and lasting a mammoth five hours, the pair caught a taxi. Allegations: Clifford, 70, from Hersham in Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls . But Clifford is said to have ‘launched himself’ at the teenager, groped her and tried to ‘passionately’ kiss her. Choosing not to give evidence behind a white curtain to protect her anonymity, she said: ‘He started trying to kiss me. ‘He kind of launched himself at me actually, and started trying to kiss me on the mouth. I tried to push him off and hold him off. ‘I put my hand up to hold him off and hold his body off because he was pushing his body onto me. He was trying to give me a passionate kiss.’ Asked by Rosina Cottage QC, prosecuting, ‘did you want it?’, she laughed and replied ‘no’. ‘Apart from anything he was much, much, much, much older than me. ‘Particularly at that age, he wasn’t a young attractive man - he was an old guy. ‘He was trying to kiss me, he started trying to grab at me. Grabbing my breasts.’ She managed to fight him off and dust herself down. But Clifford unleashed a foul-mouthed attack branding her a ‘p***k tease’ and telling her to ‘f*** off’ before storming out of the cab without paying the fare, jurors heard. She said when she returned to her office ‘I told them I didn’t believe there was a job and I didn’t believe it was safe to send young girls over to Mr Clifford’s office anyway.’ Clifford chuckled to himself and shrugged his shoulders while she spoke. Earlier in the trial the court heard that Clifford told one of his alleged victims that actress Julie Christie said he should take the girl’s virginity so she would fall in love with him. He is accused of repeatedly abusing her in his car in 1977 when she was 15. The woman told jurors that Clifford also suggested he had had a sexual relationship with Hollywood star Christie. She said: ‘He asked me which actors I liked. I said Julie Christie. ‘He said that he was her agent and he said he talked regularly to her and mentioned her on several occasions. ‘I remember him saying to me he had spoken to Julie Christie and - because this had happened to her as well, by that presumably he meant the abuse that he was doing to me - she said he should take my virginity because it would be my first and then I would fall in love with him and be 100 per cent loyal to him.’ The woman broke down in tears in the witness box as she was accused of being ‘obsessed’ about Clifford. Richard Horwell QC, defending, questioned her about research she had carried out on the internet. He asked: ‘During the period in which you were having counselling, did you become almost obsessed with Mr Clifford?’ She replied: ‘I was very frightened and I was worried he would find out about me.’ WOMAN ONE: One indecent assault in January 1966 . WOMAN TWO: One indecent assault in 1975 . WOMAN THREE: One indecent assault between July 1977 and August 1978 and on three occasions outside that period . WOMAN FOUR: One indecent assault in 1978 . WOMAN FIVE: One indecent assault in 1982 . WOMAN SIX: One indecent assault between January 1982 and December 1984, and another outside that period . WOMAN SEVEN: One indecent assault between January 1983 and December 1984 . The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told how reporting Clifford to the police in 2012 was the most difficult thing she had ever done. She said: 'It has been the worst thing of my life that has happened. 'I didn’t want to, I felt that if I didn’t go I would always be a coward and always be ashamed that I hadn’t done anything. I felt I had to do it.' The alleged victim went to the police after she saw the PR guru talking on TV about murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, the court heard. She summoned the courage to come forward after growing 'frustrated' by Clifford’s 'hypocrisy', a friend told jurors. She said: 'He was in the media a lot about the Milly Dowler case and she was getting increasingly frustrated because of the hypocrisy of the things he was saying in the media. 'Things like, how could a paedophile do that to a 13 year-old girl?' A psychotherapist told the court that she treated the alleged victim in 2011. ‘She said she was sexually abused,’ the court heard. ‘She didn’t give precise details of the abuse but it was too horrific for her.’ The counsellor said her client looked like ‘she might vomit’ before naming Clifford as her abuser. Clifford, wearing a grey suit, white shirt and grey tie, listened to her evidence using a hearing loop in the dock - and angrily huffed, tutted and shook his head as the alleged victim spoke. The woman said she met Clifford in 1977 while on holiday with her family in Torremolinos, Spain. She claims he impressed her parents and told them he could find her modelling work. Earlier the jury was read a letter from the alleged victim to Clifford claiming that he had 'raped and blackmailed her'. Clifford, 70, from Hersham in Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls. He denies all the charges and the trial continues.

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 04:29 EST, 14 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:33 EST, 14 March 2014 . Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said he would scrap the married tax allowance after the election . Labour will scrap the Conservatives’ ‘perverse and unfair’ new £1,000 transferable tax allowance for married couples, Ed Balls announced last night. The shadow Chancellor said a Labour government would reverse the Government’s proposal to restore recognition for the institution in the tax system, and spend the money to help fund a reintroduction of the 10p tax rate. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, the staunchest champion of marriage in the Cabinet, condemned the announcement. ‘Labour scrapped support for marriage when they were last in government - penalising stable families,’ Mr Duncan Smith told the Daily Mail. ‘And here they go again - same old Labour - with yet another example of making decent people pay more in taxes. ‘Conservatives support marriage because it is a vital institution which underpins stable families. We support strong relationships, which we know offer children the best start in life.’ Married couples where one person earns under the £10,000 income tax threshold will be allowed to transfer £1,000 of their allowance to their spouse – reducing their annual tax bill by £200 from April 2015. Only the 24 million basic rate taxpayers will benefit, though David Cameron has signalled he wants to go further if re-elected with a Conservative majority. Polls show overwhelming support for the new allowance, though it is opposed by both Labour and the Liberal Democrats. A recent YouGov poll found that 62 per cent of people back the idea, with just 20 per cent against. Mr Balls told the BBC last night that the tax break would only benefit a third of married couples, and one in six families with children, and declared he would scrap it if he is chancellor after the 2015 election. Assessing Mr Osborne's tax policies ahead of next week's Budget he said: ‘Personally, I think that first of all, George Osborne should first of all admit the 50p tax cut at the top was a big mistake. ‘But I also think, any tax cut for families on middle and low incomes is better than none. 'What did he actually announce last year, he said that he would introduce a married couples allowance which, when you look at the detail, only goes to a third of married couples, and one in six families with children, it goes mainly to men.' Mr Balls, pictured dancing with wife Yvette Cooper, said the tax break would only benefit a third of married couples . Downing Street was under mounting pressure last night to ease the 40p tax burden on the middle classes. The . Chancellor is expected to reject calls for a significant increase to . the threshold in next week’s Budget, after figures showed millions more . are being sucked into the higher rate tax. But they are facing growing demands . to help the 1.4million workers who have been sucked into the 40p band . since 2010, with MPs arguing many of these people are on middling . incomes. Official figures show that the top 25 . per cent of earners – anyone on £33,717 or more – will pay 75 per cent . of the country’s total £167billion of income tax this year. By contrast, the bottom half will pay less than 10 per cent. When the Coalition came to power in May 2010 the starting salary for higher rate tax stood at just £43,875. If . George Osborne had allowed the 40p tax band to rise in line with . inflation it would now not kick in until a worker reached a salary of . £50,000, according to calculations by accountants Grant Thornton. Mr Balls went on: ‘We think what we should actually do is scrap the married couples allowance which is perverse and unfair, and use that money to give a tax cut for all middle and lower income families. ‘We propose a new 10p starting rate of income tax. It's better than the personal allowance, because it's better for work incentives, it would help two-thirds of married couples, it would help women as well as men, families with children. ‘Let's cut taxes for working families, and let's ease this cost-of-living crisis rather than carrying on pandering to Tory backbenchers with tax cuts that are unfair and don't make sense.’ The shadow chancellor also admitted being ‘daunted’ by the prospect of being in Number 11 after the election with further efforts to cut the deficit necessary. Asked how he would respond to the Tory charge that voters should not ‘give the keys back to the guy who crashed the car’, Mr Balls added: ‘All of us in our lives get things right, but all of us make some mistakes, and the last Labour government didn't regulate the financial services in a tough enough way. ‘But we've learnt from that and we'll come in not just with experience, not just some wisdom which comes from that experience, but with utter determination to make this country fairer and stronger for the future.’ A Government source said scrapping the marriage tax allowance would save under £500 million a year, a fraction of the £2 billion a year cost of introducing a new 10p tax band covering the first £1,000 of earnings. ‘Once again Ed Balls’ sums simply don’t add up. His latest gimmick would mean £1.5 billion more spending, more borrowing and more taxes to pay for it,’ the source said. ‘Nothing changes – it’s the same old Labour with no long-term economic plan to secure a better future for Britain.’ Labour has previously suggested it would also use the proceeds of a new mansion tax on properties worth £2 million or more to fund a 10p rate. Gordon Brown scrapped the 10p rate in his last Budget, and all those who used to pay it now pay no tax at all because of the coalition’s new £10,000 tax threshold.","Shadow chancellor vows to tear up recognition of marriage in tax system .

Cold Feet and Spooks star Hermione Norris says that she shops from Asda's Smart Price range because British television drama roles don't pay much . A star of hit drama Cold Feet has claimed that British television pays so poorly that she has been forced to shop for groceries from Asda's Smart Price range. Hermione Norris, 46, says that times have got tough for TV actresses since she starred as stressed middle-class mother Karen Marsden in the ITV series. Despite earning a reported £75,000 per episode for the final series of the popular programme in 2003, she now says been reduced to Asda's cheapest produce. 'It's quite a different industry now and the money has gone down hugely. So there's still quite a bit of Asda Smart Price going on in my life,' she says in an interview with Reader's Digest, seen by the Daily Telegraph. 'I think perhaps if you work in America, the fees are still very good. But my life is here and I love British drama. And, you know, there is a part of me that would rather eat beans than find myself working in something that I didn't believe in.' Her stance is quite a turnaround from comments made the year before last, when she told the Daily Mail in an interview that one temptation she couldn't resist was 'buying for a family of ten in Waitrose'. 'I'll happily spend an hour there and rack up a bill of £300,' she said at the time. In that same interview she revealed that her 'prized possession' she values 'above all others' was the Aga at her second home in Dorset. 'It cost £10,000 to put in ten years ago, but was worth every penny. It’s the heart of the home – it makes amazing roasts, dries clothes and I even sit the kids on it to warm them up!' Norris and her producer husband Simon Wheeler spend most of their time at their spacious city home in West London, where they live with their children, Wilf, nine, and Hero, six. She first came to prominence in ITV comedy drama Cold Feet in 1997, a show that may well have been Hermione's final chance to make it as an actress. Norris as posh alcoholic Karen Marsden in Cold Feet, a role that earned her a phenomenal £70,000 per episode.

Work had been sporadic before she was offered the role of posh alcoholic Karen Marsden, and Norris – whose parents split when she was four, leaving her mother, Helen, to bring up four children – had seriously considered ditching acting for a career as a lawyer. But since her star turn in the hit series she has worked pretty much constantly, with roles in wire In The Blood, Kingdom and Spooks. Action woman: Norris brandishes a pistol in Spooks. She is set to appear in two new dramas on BBC One . She has said of her action packed role in the spy series: 'It was bizarre, sometimes, to go home and bathe the children after being blown up in Spooks, or having been in bed with another actor. 'But I always try not to let work invade my time with my children. I try to find the right balance between work and home life. 'I think it's a myth that women can have it all. They can't! It's always a juggling act.' Now Norris is set to appear in two new prime-time series on BBC One: Crimson Field, a drama set in a field hospital during the First World War; and In The Club, which follows the lives of a group of mothers-to-be.","Hermione Norris says earnings for TV stars have fallen since Cold Feet .

Sex attacker Robert Gwyn Lewis wrote a song about his victim which included the lyrics 'I hope you die' A sex attacker wrote a song about his victim which included the lyrics ‘I hope you die’ and posted it on Facebook to try and intimidate her. Robert Gwyn Lewis, 31, of Deeside, in Flintshire, North Wales, also threatened kill the woman in person to prevent her from giving evidence against him. Lewis was jailed for nine years after he admitted sexual assault by penetration and physical assault on the woman at Mold Crown Court. He also admitted to perverting the course of justice. Elen Owen, prosecuting, said the victim found the song particularly upsetting and felt sick when she saw it. In the song, he repeated the chorus ‘I hope you die’ – and described her as ‘a scumbag and a liar’. The song also included the words ‘I hope you get AIDS’, and Lewis threatened to ‘poke out both your eyes.’ Later, when the two came face to face, he shouted at her, telling the woman he would kill her if she testified in court. He told her: ‘I can destroy your whole world.’ The earlier sex attacks had occurred when the defendant visited the victim’s home. The crimes included an incident in which he gripped her around the throat and the woman thought she was going to die. Judge Phillip Hughes said that the sexual offences were the most serious and jailed him for eight years. He received concurrent 12 month sentences for the physical assaults on her. The judge also imposed an additional 12 month consecutive sentence for perverting the course of justice by trying to intimidate the victim out of giving evidence. The judge described the song he performed on Facebook about her as ‘threatening, abusive, nasty [and] ugly’. He said it was intended to cause as much upset as he could. Lewis was jailed for nine years after he admitted sexual assault by penetration and physical assault on the woman at Mold Crown Court (pictured) Kim Halsall, defending, said that the defendant, who had no previous convictions, was full of shame and remorse at what he had done. He had admitted the offences which had prevented the victim from reliving her ordeal in court. The judge ordered Lewis - who closed his eyes when the nine year sentence was announced - to register with the police as a sex offender for life. He also made a restraining order not to approach his victim in any way - including by social media.","Robert Gwyn Lewis, 31, tried to intimidate his victim out of giving evidence .

MPs are in line for an extra week off, adding to mounting evidence the Coalition is running out of things to do. Government sources last night confirmed they are considering giving MPs an additional week’s holiday, fuelling criticism that with so few laws to debate, and more than a year to go before the next election, the Commons and Lords are turning into a ‘Zombie Parliament’ of part-time politicians. It follows an announcement last week in the Lords, that peers are to get an extra five days off at Easter. Zombie Parliament: One analysis shows that MPs are doing less work on government business than at any time in the past decade, with a third less time spent on legislation than during last Labour government . Last night Labour seized on the news as proof the Coalition is ‘becalmed’. It means MPs may get 24 weeks off this year. The Mail on Sunday revealed in January that the Queen’s Speech is to be delayed from its planned date of May 7 because the Government is short of ‘exciting’ policies to put in the legislative programme. It will now take place on June 3. There have also been repeated claims that with so little to occupy them, many MPs are going home after the weekly Prime Minister’s Questions. One insider said: ‘Some MPs come down on Monday afternoon and leave by Wednesday afternoon. ‘Everyone keeps quiet about it because they know voters would be horrified.’ One analysis shows that MPs are doing less work on government business than at any time in the past decade, with a third less time spent on legislation than during last Labour government.

John Downey, who walked free from court after the Hyde Park bomb trial collapsed, has defended joining the IRA . Suspected Hyde Park bomber John Downing has defended joining the IRA, insisting he had to ‘fight fire with fire’. The case against the 62-year-old collapsed last month after appalling blunders by police and prosecutors. It meant he walked free from court less than a year after being arrested for one of the IRA’s most notorious mainland atrocities. His remarks about joining the IRA will cause further upset for victims' families. On July 20, 1982, a car bomb left on South Carriage Drive killed the soldiers as they rode through Hyde Park in Central London to the changing of the guard. In May last year Mr Downey was arrested at Gatwick Airport and charged with killing Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young. Seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to Buckingham Palace. The case against Mr Downey collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the UK. In his first full-length interview since the Old Bailey case against him collapsed, Mr Downey said he was given his so-called ‘comfort letter’ just days after the Northern Ireland Assembly was set up. ‘As far as the Unionists saying that they didn’t know about the letters, of course they knew,’ he said. ‘I got the letter in 2007, having applied through Sinn Fein in 2003, four years later the application was granted as part of an ongoing process.’ But he went on the defend joining the IRA after watching news reports as a teenager on the unfolding turmoil in Northern Ireland . ‘I felt that I could not ignore the situation in the north and pretend that my fellow Irish men and women had nothing to do with me,’ he said told his local newspaper, the Donegal Democrat. ‘I could see, at that time, that nothing was going to be accomplished by peaceful means and we had to fight fire with fire.’ More than 30 years after the 1982 IRA Hyde Park Bombing John Anthony Downey was charged with the murder of four soldiers. The case against him has collapsed last month . He was jailed for IRA membership in 1974. But he says he later became dedicated to the peace process and worked to persuade others to give up violence. ‘As far as the letter is concerned this was an arrangement between the British and Irish Government and my arrest was a breach of the agreement reached between the British and Irish government,’ he said. Travelling to Canada in 2008, he claims the authorities there were assured by British authorities that they had no issue with him. ‘I am told that the reason for my arrest was that I had come up on the police national computer (PNC),’ he said. ‘I had been in and out of Birmingham airport on numerous occasions. I’d also been in Stansted and then on that last day they decided to arrest me. ‘I refuse to believe that if I was on the PNC that I would have gone through all those airports including Derry and Belfast, because that is within their jurisdiction, without being picked up,’ he said.

A van driver who tried to wriggle out of a small fine for using his mobile phone at the wheel ended up with a five-year jail sentence - after information stored on the device led police to his £365,000 cocaine stash. Andrew Botto, 26, was stopped by traffic officers on road in Swansea after they noticed him using his phone while driving. However, rather than accept an on-the-spot fine, Botto tried to convince the officers that they must have been imagining things – telling them that his mobile phone was actually at home. But the police found the mobile on the back seat – and £3,000 cash in the glovebox, a court heard. Becoming ever more suspicious, they searched through data on the mobile and found information that led them to a container positioned on a building site in Swansea where a kilogram of the class A drug - the size of a bag of flour - was found. Prosecutor Geraint Walters said: ‘Botto was seen driving while on the phone and when he denied it the police smelled a rat. ‘Officers searched a number of properties linked to Botto, including a freight container on land he rented. Lock-up: Police found Botto's £365,000 cocaine haul in this container at a Swansea building site . ‘They used his keys to open the container where they found the drugs which weighed just less than 1kg.’ Swansea Crown Court heard the drugs were 66 per cent purity and could have earned the dealer £365,000. Botto, who runs a small supermarket in Swansea, admitted possession of the Class A drug with intent to supply. The court heard he had been asked to store the drugs and would have been paid when they were collected. Judge Paul Thomas told him he had provided a ‘valuable service’ to the drug dealers and jailed him for five years.","Swansea motorist Andrew Botto was stopped for using his mobile phone .

Holiday nightmare: Heidi-Ray Noble Steeples suffered life-changing injuries when she fell from the top of a play area slide in Turkey . An eight-year-old girl lost a kidney after she went down a slide at a Thomas Cook resort and fell on a picket fence at the bottom. Now her family are suing the holiday giant over the ‘life-changing injury’ she suffered, which has left her unable to participate in her favourite hobby of horse-riding . Heidi-Ray Noble Steeples landed on a ‘poorly positioned’ fence in the play area of a resort in Oludeniz, Turkey. Heidi-Ray was rushed from the hotel to a local hospital where her kidney was removed during two weeks of treatment in August 2012. She also developed pneumonia and suffered a bad reaction to plasters used on her wounds causing her further pain. After returning to UK the youngster also faced a number of outpatient appointments with a renal specialist before being given the all-clear to return to school. Her family, of Tingley, West Yorkshire, say Thomas Cook should take responsibility for her injuries, which have left her unable to take part in her beloved hobby of horse riding. They have instructed specialist lawyers at legal firm Irwin Mitchell to secure a settlement on her behalf. Mother Sarah Noble Steeples said: ‘Falling from that slide has changed her life forever. ‘It could all so easily have been prevented if the resort had taken more care with the layout of its play area. ‘It was heartbreaking to see Heidi in such pain on what should have been a really enjoyable holiday and it was an incredibly difficult time for the family. Legal action: Heidi-Ray's family is suing Thomas Cook over the injuries . Lengthy treatment: After Heidi-Ray injured herself at Oludeniz (pictured), she required a two-week stay in hospital . ‘Whilst Heidi has made a good recovery, it is such a shame that she is no longer able to take part in the same activities that she did before the accident. ‘It was very upsetting for Heidi to be told that she could not go back to horse riding.’ She added: ‘We want to make sure somebody takes responsibility for Heidi’s fall. ‘There’s no excuse for an eight-year-old having to go through this and having to adjust to life after the incident without being able to return to all of the things she used to love doing.’ Demetrius Danas, an international personal injury law specialist at Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘Heidi’s life has been changed greatly because of the fall. ‘Losing a kidney is a very serious, life-changing event and a hugely stressful situation for anybody, let alone an eight-year-old girl. ‘We have started legal action against Thomas Cook following the incident and have invited them to admit responsibility for what happened to Heidi. ‘We hope that Thomas Cook will now work with us constructively to provide Heidi with a full and fair financial settlement for the injuries she has sustained and the treatment, care and support she has needed to date as well as any that she may require in the future.’ Thomas Cook said: ‘We were naturally very concerned to hear about Miss Noble Steeples’ accident while on holiday with us. ‘As we are in the process of liaising directly with the family’s legal representative in relation to this, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time.’ The hotel removed the fence following the accident and put up a sign saying children should be supervised in the play area.","Heidi-Ray Noble Steeples landed on a 'poorly positioned' fence in Turkey .

The Queen Mary 2 is the largest ocean liner in the world and on Sunday her captain got a fresh view of her size and majesty. Captain Kevin Oprey stood on the ship’s bulbous bow, which protrudes from the front of the 151,200 tonne liner, to pose for a portrait with his ship. The photographs, taken to mark the tenth anniversary of the liner in May this year, were shot while she was docked at a port off the coast of Bali. Scroll down for video . Captain Kevin Oprey stands on the bulbous bow of the Queen Mary 2 . off the coast of Bali in photographs taken to mark the ocean liner's tenth anniversary in May . It took months of strategic and safety planning to work out how to get Captain Oprey onto the bulbous bow, which helps to stabilise the ship and streamline movement, and dips in and out of the water depending on currents and swell. But it was an idea too good to pass up. ‘When I suggested we photograph the captain standing on the bulbous bow, they all looked at me like I was a tiny bit mad, but the fact it hadn’t been done was why we had to do it,’ photographer James Morgan told MailOnline. Mr Morgan was in Sydney last week when he got a call that the conditions in Bali were perfect for the shoot and so he hurried to the Indonesian island to capture the images. However, by the time he arrived the conditions had worsened and he spent a ‘nervous five or six hours on the bridge’, before the weather calmed and they were able to get the captain safely onto the bulbous bow. Mr Morgan said ‘safety was paramount’ and they used two safety boats to transport Captain Oprey to the bow. He took the shot from a small boat floating in front of the Queen Mary 2. Vulnerable vantage point: Captain Kevin Oprey was dwarfed by his ship in the photographs, standing in front of the 151,200 tonne ship . Mr Morgan, who has been taking photos for Cunard, who own the Queen Mary 2, for ten years, says he wanted to take photographs for the anniversary of the liner that would showcase her beauty. ‘For me, the lines, the shapes, the curves of the Queen Mary 2, make her the most amazing ocean liner in the world, she really is,’ he said. The Queen Mary 2 accommodates 2,620 passengers and 1,253 crew.  In her first 10 years of operation, the ocean liner has undertaken more than 420 voyages including 200 transatlantic crossings. She is currently completing a round-the-world journey to celebrate the tenth anniversary, culminating with a large celebration in Southampton in May. In order to capture the size of the liner, the Sydney-based photographer used a very wide angle lens on his Nikon camera. For Captain Oprey it was an experience he will never forget. ‘The captain was very, very, very excited to be part of it. It’s somewhere he’s never been; he’s always 12 storeys above conducting his team from the bridge,’ said Mr Morgan. 'I talked to him afterwards and he did tell me he felt very alone and very isolated being where he was.' The captain said he felt 'excited' but also 'isolated' standing underneath the ship's soaring hull .

Aleksander Owens-Thurston, 23, was skiing at the Austrian resort of Kaprun when the accident happened on the managed slope. The metal frame was not covered in protective padding and his family believe the tragedy could have been prevented if safety standards were better. His father Phillip Owens-Thurston, an IT expert  has condemned safety measures at the resort. 'When they installed it they should have taken a look and said, ‘What could happen here, can someone get thrown onto it?,' he said. 'If they had put padding in I think he would not be dead now. 'I think he would be hospital with us writing sarcy comments on his plaster. 'It would not be good, but he would be alive. This was supposed to be a managed piste. 'You don’t stick a huge chunk of steel out where people can fall into it at 30 or 40 miles an hour - and that is what is going to happen.

'Where he hit . his head would not have really been covered by a helmet anyway. The one . thing that might have saved him is the padding. 'If what’s happened to Aleks can save even one life, then we can take something away from it. At the moment we have nothing. 'He . lived life to the full and it’s a tragedy that he’s been taken from us. I don’t begrudge a second of the time we had with him, but I begrudge . the moments we’ll now never have. 'He was such a wonderful young man and will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him.' Police . spokesman Markus Maier said: 'He was not wearing a crash helmet and was . on piste number 25 which is categorised as a black run and therefore . difficult. 'He was at a height of roughly 1,700m when he lost control and ended up sliding 130ft down the slope before shooting into the air at the side of the ski run. 'He went about 43ft through the air and hit his head against the arm of an artificial snow cannon at full speed. The family, who go skiing every year, were enjoying a holiday in the Austrian resort of Kaprun (pictured) when Aleksander lost control on an advanced black run . 'By chance there was a group of three skiers behind and one of these was a doctor who was able to give emergency CPR to the young man and called for an emergency helicopter. 'But the emergency doctor could only certify that the young man was dead.' Mr r Owens-Thurston's father's calls for safety improvements were echoed by a coroner. West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose spoke out as he opened and adjourned the inquest and urged Britons heading off on skiing holidays during the forthcoming Easter break to wear a helmet. The coroner said the IT worker suffered fractures to his skull 'due to a ski accident where he fell and collided into a snow machine' on February 24 while skiing on a black run. 'After a fall while skiing he possibly fell head on into a snow machine. I have given authorisation for the funeral,' Mr Rose said. 'The deceased was not wearing a helmet. We are coming up soon to the Easter holidays and I would urge anyone to wear a helmet. 'I would urge the Austrian authorities to put padding on the snow machines.' Mr Owens-Thurston's family were not present during the brief hearing in Taunton today and his funeral is due to take place in the Somerset town tomorrow.","Aleksander Owens-Thurston, 23, died at Austrian resort of Kaprun .

Tragic: Audrey Wakefield was 82 when she fell backwards off a chair weeks after a stroke and broke her back - but it went undiagnosed by medics at Mid Staffordshire hospital . Doctors at scandal-hit Mid Staffordshire Hospital failed to notice an 82-year-old grandmother had broken her back - and discharged her before she died. Audrey Wakefield was admitted after falling backwards off a chair onto a beside table in her nursing home on February 20 last year. The grandmother-of-two was left with severe head injuries, bleeding on the brain, and a broken back. But she was merely given stitches before being discharged and returned to Manor House nursing home in Stone, Staffordshire. Two days later, Mrs Wakefield became erratic and was rushed to nearby University Hospital of North Staffordshire (UHNS). There, doctors discovered she was bleeding into her brain and had broken her vertebrae. She was immediately sent to Douglas McMillan Hospice in Stoke-on-Trent where she died on April 11. Today, South Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh heard that doctors could not explain why the broken back was not spotted. Dr Indira Natarajan, a consultant physician at UHNS, told the inquest: 'On February 24, she was admitted with confusion and spent time on another ward before being referred to the stroke ward. 'A scan showed that she had damage to the spine and a bleed into her brain. She also had thrombosis in her bladder. 'I cannot say why another unit did not carry out the scan, it is hard to say, I think I would have carried out the scan, but I cannot know the circumstances. 'After some time it was decided that our care was doing more harm than good and she was very distressed. After consulting with the family we moved her to palliative care.' The inquest heard that Mrs Wakefield had suffered as stroke in January and was cared for at UHNS before being sent home with difficulty speaking. Mrs Wakefield was sent back to her nursing home with a broken back by staff at the scandal-hit hospital . Mrs Wakefield's daughter Anne Dicks told the court the stroke team had never visited her mother. She said: 'I know that no one visited her. The home had no central heating, she was sent to the care home because she was an ice block and there were snow drifts outside. 'I was the next of kin and no one asked me before she was discharged the first time. My father was suffering from shock.' Lesley Powell, who is manager of Manor House home, said: 'She suffered the fall apparently when she attempted to get out of the chair she was in unaided and toppled backwards onto a unit. A consultant physician at UHNS told the inquest she could not see why another unit did not carry out scans . 'Staff called an ambulance at 16.35 and she was taken to hospital at 21.05. She wasn't seen as an emergency.' Dr Terence Hollingworth, a pathologist who carried out Mrs Wakefield's post mortem told the coroner that she had died of bronchial pneumonia and a closed head injury. He said: 'The broken back was significant in that it showed that she had fallen backwards and that was how the head injury came about.' The inquest was adjourned to continue at a later date.","Audrey Wakefield admitted after falling backwards off chair in nursing home .

Former US Congressman Mel Reynolds says he is in hiding in South Africa following his deportation from Zimbabwe because he believes his life is in danger. He told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he believes he is being pursued by a secret Zimbabwean death squad because of information he has on American businessmen, especially from Chicago, who are doing business illegally with Zimbabwe. He accused the regime of President Robert Mugabe of 'trumping up' pornography charges against him two weeks ago to discredit him. Former US Congressman Mel Reynolds, center left, was arrested last month in Zimbabwe after overstaying his visa. He was later deported to South Africa . He was arrested February 16 and after spending a few days in a Zimbabwean jail, the pornography charges were dropped on a technicality while he pleaded guilty to violating Zimbabwe's immigration laws. Authorities say they found 100 videos and 2,000 images of naked women on his phone and laptop - including some depicting sex acts. 'There were no pornographic images on the phone that would be considered pornographic in any place other than Zimbabwe,' he told WLS-TV. 'That in and of itself is a ruse. If a picture of woman topless is pornography, then I plead the Fifth.' After his arrest, he spent six days in a Zimbabwean jail under horrific conditions. Reynolds was forced to resign in 1995 after he was convicted of statutory rape for his sexual relationship with a 16-year-old campaign volunteer . 'Fifty people dressed in rags slept on concrete floors with no running water. Only one toilet that hadn't worked in four or five years. The stench was beyond your imagination,' he told the Chicago TV station. He was released after paying a $100 fine and deported to South Africa on February 23.

He was forced to resign after being convicted of child pornography and statutory rape for an illicit affair with a 16-year-old campaign volunteer. He had initially claimed that the charges were racially motivated.

BlackBerry is rumoured to be working on a 5-inch touchscreen handset called the A10, or 'Aristo.' Speculation has been mounting since last week when images of the device surfaced online and now a leaked video and presentation slide, believed to show the phone's full specifications, add weight to these rumours. The YouTube video has since been removed but screengrabs taken by Crackberry - the BlackBerry fan forum - suggest that the A10 will have a 5-inch touchscreen, an 8MP camera, a dual-core processor with a quad-core GPU and will run the next version of the BlackBerry operating system, BB 10.2. A video believed to showcase some of the specifications of BlackBerry's rumoured A10 handset, pictured, has leaked online. It was posted by Vietnam-based phone accessory maker Vivix and shows the phone as having a 5-inch touchscreen and 8MP camera . Processor: Dual Core 1.7GHz Qualcomm MSM8960 Pro, Quad Core GPU . Radio: LTE/CDMA/HSPA+, LTE/HSPA+ . Display: 5"" OLED, HD/WXGA, 1280x720, 24-bit color, S-Stripe Pixel Arrangement, 295ppi . Dimensions: 140.7 x 72 x 9.4mm (9.7 Verizon) OS: BlackBerry OS 10.2 . Camera: 8.0MP Rear Camera with flash, IS 5X / 2.0MP Front Camera IS 5X . Memory: 16GB + 2GB(RAM) + 64GB USB . Connectors: Micro USB, Micro HDMI out . Sensors: Ambient Light, Proximity, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer, Altimeter . WiFi: 802.11 a/b/g/n (4G Mobile Hotspot) Battery: 2800 mAh Integrated . Other: NFC, DLNA, Micro SIM . If the rumours and leaked specifications are true, the A10 will directly compete with Samsung's 5-inch Galaxy S4 handset. The presentation slide showing the A10's specifictions appeared on the Crackberry forum at the weekend. It appears to come directly from BlackBerry because it has BlackBerry branding in the top left-hand corner as well as a 'BlackBerry confidential - shared under NDA'. BlackBerry told MailOnline it did not comment on rumours. The full list of specifications show that the A10 is expected to have a dual-core 1.7Ghz Qualcommon processor with a quad-core CPU. It is also shown as potentially having 2GB RAM. This quad-core would make the device faster at playing games, for example, and could improve the phone's battery life, which is listed as a 2800 mAh. If this battery specification is accurate, it would make the A10 more powerful than the current batteries in the Samsung and Apple flagship models. The BlackBerry fan forum, Crackberry.com, discovered a leaked presentation slide, pictured, believed to show the A10's official specifications. In addition to what was shown in the video, the A10 is listed here as having a 16GB internal storage, 2GB of RAM and a high-power battery . It will have a 5-inch OLED screen with a 1280x270 resolution and a pixel density of 295 PPI. Although this is the same size as Samsung's Galaxy S4 screen, the Korean handset has a higher resolution - 1080x1920 pixels - and a higher PPI at 441. These elements make the screen images sharper and clearer. The A10 is shown as being 9.4mm thick, which is much thicker than Samsung's 7.9mm handset and Apple's 7.6mm iPhone 5. Elsewhere on the slide, the A10 is shown as having an 8MP rear-facing camera and a 2.5MP on the front of the device. This video grab shows what is believed to be the back of the BlackBerry A10 handset. The phone, which is expected to be launched later this year, is shown as being around 9.7mm thick - almost 2mm thicker than Samsung and Apple flagship models . It is rumoured to launch with 16GB of internal storage, micro USB and HDMI and NFC built-in. BlackBerry launched its BB 10 operating system with its Z10 and Q10 handsets last year and it is said to be working on the next version, BB 10.2. It is likely that the A10 will launch either around the same time, or be the first handset to launch with the updated system. The video, leaked earlier this week on YouTube, was posted by accessory maker Vivix. In the video an unknown person gives a brief look at what's rumoured to be the A10 'Aristo' and is shown apparently showing off a first version of the handset. The video has since been removed. The BlackBerry A10 would be larger and more powerful than the Apple iPhone 5's 4-inch screen. However, Apple is rumoured to be working on a follow-up handset, dubbed the iPhone 5S, due to be released in September.","BlackBerry rumoured to be working on a 5-inch phone called A10 .

Sandy Jenkins, who earned $50,000 a year, allegedly used 888 company checks to pay his creditors for luxury goods, and then tampered with the accounts to try to cover his tracks, Corsicana Daily Sun reported. He and his wife, Kay, were this week charged with money laundering over the alleged scam, which continued for eight years. They are accused of spending up to $250,000 a month but the disparity between Mr Jenkins' lifestyle and salary went unnoticed for years. Scroll down for video . Lavish lifestyle: Kay and Sandy Jenkins, pictured on what is believed to be a private jet, are accused of embezzling $16 million . Investigation: Sandy Jenkins, center, talks to two FBI agents outside his neighbor's house, while his own property is searched in Corsicana in August last year . Target: Jenkins is accused of stealing from the 117-year-old Collin Street Bakery where he was controller . Jenkins, the 65-year-old corporate . controller for Collin Street Bakery in Corsicana, was arrested in August . last year, and charged with ten counts of mail fraud. He was earning $50,000 a year but the FBI claims the couple were actually spending nearer to $250,000 a month. The FBI has seized luxury goods from Sandy and Kay Jenkins, who are accused of taking $16 million from the Collin Street Bakery: . The couple's mansion in Corsicana, Texas, and $784,000 villa in Santa Fe, New Mexico. 596-bottle wine collection. $2,500 Waterford Crystal 12 Days of Christmas ice bucket. $10,000 Sex in the City 2 ring with a five carat black diamond. Louis Vuitton luggage, Hermes handbag and other designer purses. $60,000 Steinway piano. Four fur coats including a $15,000 mink fur coat and a reversible mink and leather bomber jacket. Luxury cars including a BMW X53, a Lexus, a Mercedes-Benz CL500 and a GMS Yukon XL Denali. 108 watches, including a men’s Patek Philippe 18 carat rose gold 40mm Aquanaut watch. A collection of  Van Cleef & Arpels jewelry, more than 80 bracelets and necklaces, and 53 rings. On Wednesday, his 63-year-old wife was indicted, and the couple will now face charges on 22 further counts, including money laundering and making false statements to a financial institution. Jenkins is said to have claimed they were paying for their extravagant lifestyle through an inheritance. The couple are accused of funding a lavish lifestyle from December 2004 to August 2012. During that time they spent $3.2 million on private jets to fly them to Aspen, Napa, Martha's Vineyard, and the Turks and Caicos islands. They 'conspired together to maintain an extensive and lavish lifestyle through expenditures of the money embezzled from the Bakery,' the U.S. Attorney's Office told Dallas News. Investigators claim the couple used the funds to buy a vacation home in Santa Fe; several vehicles including a Mercedes and a Lexus; a Steinway piano, six firearms, furs, jewelry, art work and an extensive wine collection. Jenkins and his wife are also accused of running up $11 million in charges on their American Express cards. Hayden Crawford, a partner at the 117-year-old bakery, said the company was shocked to learn of the fraud. 'When this was going down, our suspicions fell on everything except our own people. We are obviously far better at making a quality fruitcake than spotting a thief,' he said. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his wife is expected to self-surrender when she makes her first court appearance on March 18. The indictment has a forfeiture allegation that would require the couple to give up the full $16,649786 taken as well as surrender two homes, four cars, $440,000 in currency seized, furs, a piano, watches, handbags, luggage and artwork. The couple's luxury Corsicana house was handed over to the FBI and put on the market last month . A silver Mercedes-Benz CL500, similar to the one pictured, was handed over to the FBI by Jenkins . A GMC Yukon, similar to the one above, and BMW X53, like the one below, were among the cars taken from Jenkins . Their Corsicana home went on the market last month for $199,500, and the proceeds will be handed over to the bakery. The fraud went undetected for so long because of the trusting nature of the bakery's owners and what has been described as an almost-foolproof scheme. Tristed: Sandy Jenkins had worked at the bakery from 1998 . The bakery spent a huge sum on nuts for its cakes, and postage for promotional material. Large checks were allegedly written to the nut or postal companies, and then entered into the books without an invoice number. The checks were then canceled and the accounts' entries unchanged, before fresh checks with an electronic signature were allegedly sent to Jenkins' account. The chief executive of the bakery also never reviewed his checks. FBI Special Agent Christine Edson said in an affidavit that the bakery's books had not been audited since Jenkins started with the company in 1998. Hayden Crawford, a partner at the baker, told the Star Telegram: 'We have a family-owned, family-run business where trust is foundational.' The amount taken was just enough to not damage profits at the bakery, so although senior management were aware money was going awry, they believed it was due to mismanagement or inventory theft. It wasn't until former bank teller Semetric Williams joined the accounts department that the fraud was revealed. Lavish: A Steinway piano, similar to the one pictured, was also taken from the couple . Extravagant: A stack of Louis Vuitton luggage and collection of watches including a Patek Philippe rose-gold time piece were also listed in the FBI report . In June she questioned Jenkins about . some questionable entries, but when he brushed it off she went to senior . management telling them she had uncovered a major embezzlement and . feared for her life. The unusual entry she had noted was a $20,000 check that appeared to have been written for a $10,000 postal bill. After he was fired on June 21, Jenkins allegedly filled two Whole Foods grocery bags with jewelry, watches and $62,500 in cash. The FBI says he tried to get his daughter to look after the bags, but when she refused they mysteriously disappeared. A police officer later found 40lb of watches in jewelery in a Texas lake. Appraisers for the FBI said it would cost $4.4 million to replace the couple's collection of jewelery, watches and designer goods. If Jenkins is found guilty he could face up to 200 years in prison. He and his wife would also have to reimburse the bakery.

Blighted: The normally verdant countryside could become brown if expert fears for a fungal disease is realised . Last year’s wet weather had already caused record levels of the blight, according to the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS). A thing of the past? Blight could devastate the countryside because of the wettest winter on record . And the problem is set to get worse, with the two forms of the disease, Cylindrocladium buxi and Volutella buxi, flourishing. Dr John David, the RHS’s chief scientist, said it had seen more inquiries about box blight so far in 2014 than in the same period last year. He added: ‘We believe this is mostly due to problems left over from mild, wet conditions we experienced in 2013. 'Although the extent of any problem won’t become clear until after April, when the weather heats up . . . the RHS believes the likelihood is that box blight will continue to be a common problem in 2014.’ The RHS list of the most common garden diseases for 2013, to be published on Monday, reveals inquiries about box blight were at their highest since the society began keeping records in 1996. The two forms of blight were fourth and fifth on the list, up from sixth and eighth in 2012. For the 18th year, honey fungus, which attacks the roots of perennial plants, was the top disease. Leaf spots, mildews and root rots were also common. Box blight was found in 1994 at a Hampshire nursery and has spread across the home counties. Recently, the National Trust had to remove all the box at Buckland Abbey, in Devon, and replant with Japanese holly. Alternatives to box are hebe, box-leaved holly and boxleaf honeysuckle.","Affected hedges will have to be destroyed say experts .

Chu's Jeopardy! strategy involved ditching . the time-honored practice of polishing off each category's questions one . by one. Instead, he took a hopscotch approach to his category choices, . which tended to keep his opponents off-kilter. He . also concluded that the bottom rows of the game board are most likely . to contain the hidden Daily Doubles and he played accordingly. Chu's . strategy fueled indignation from Jeopardy! traditionalists, who . contended that such an aggressive style was somehow unsportsmanlike and . exhibited a lack of respect for the game. Mr Chu told GMA . on Thursday: 'I spent a lot of time preparing. There's a huge online . community talking about this stuff, discussing the games. If you immerse . yourself in the culture, you can find out about this stuff.' He said that his wife was really happy with his huge win along with his mom who watched Chu from the studio audience. Jeopardy! champ Arthur Chu plans to take his wife Eliza Blair on a vacation to China . When asked how he would spend his prize money of $297,200, he said: 'I don't want to do anything crazy or stupid.' He plans to take his wife to China on vacation because she has never been and he wants to visit relatives he hasn't seen in a long time. Mr Chu also said he planned to buy a house in the future. Mr Chu was unseated by Diana Peloquin of Ann Arbor, Michigan, who led for the day with $15,700. The reigning champ had struggled for much of the show when, in Final Jeopardy, he risked, . and lost, his entire day's bankroll - $6,400 - on the question: 'He was . the last male monarch who had not previously been Prince of Wales.' Only Peloquin had the correct response: George VI. The . 30-year-old Chu described . himself on Twitter as 'mad genius, comedian, actor and freelance . voiceover artist'. He . applied a 'mad genius' approach to Jeopardy! brinkmanship. Chu . 'rejected the unwritten rule that the guy or gal with the most facts . wins,' said On the Media host Brooke Gladstone on an episode of the . public radio show last month, 'and replaced it with the appalling idea . that you can outwit your opponent with the wily application of game . theory'. It was a style . much different from that of legendary know-it-all Ken Jennings, who a . decade ago set a Jeopardy! record with 74 consecutive victories while . winning $2.5 million. Arthur Chu, 30, pictured with Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek, won a whopping $297,000 using game theory . Chu, an insurance . compliance analyst, who does freelance voiceovers, spent a month . studying the quiz where people guess the questions to answers that pop . up on the screen. When . he first appeared on the show earlier this year, he baffled opponents . by picking squares at random and betting strange amounts on his answers, . rather than moving down the board in a straight line. Arthur . calls the strategy, which aims to disarm his opponents, Forrest Bounce, . after successful 1980s player Chuck Forrest who also 'bounced' around . the board. His controversial strategy helped him win 12 times in a row. The strategy sparked outrage across social media, as viewers accused Mr Chu of 'unsportsmanship'. But Mr Chu dismissed the furor, telling Fox News: 'Like any game, strategy plays a big role.' He . added: 'I can't change your impression of me but, again, we're playing . for money. Between $10,000 and getting haters on Twitter, $10,000 is . more important to me.'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Arrgh: Arthur's game-play tactics appear to delight and frustrate viewers in equal measure . The . so-called 'evil genius', as dubbed by angry Twitter users, has also . received support from the show's host Megyn Kelly, who said Arthur . 'seems to get' the concept of winning. In the game, three contestants stand behind lecterns with a buzzer, a screen and a light pen. They . are presented with answers to questions on a range of topics - history, . science, arts, popular culture, literature, and languages - and must . guess what was asked to reach them. Each . category has five clues, ranked in order of difficulty. For every . correct answer, the player wins the value of the square - the easiest is . $200, the hardest is $1,000. There . are also 'Daily Doubles', where a contestant can stake as much money as . they want on a pot luck question in the hope of doubling it. Arthur is quick and confident with his answers, darting from a $1,000 question to $200 for seemingly no reason. But he has received a mixed reception from viewers with some sites such as Philly.com are calling him a 'hero', whilst others blogs like BarStool describe him as a 'mad genius'. Before appearing on the show, Arthur claims he studied the mechanics of the gameshow that has been running for 30 years. 'I . decided pretty early on, you know, I'm not going to be able to learn . all the things I don't know in terms of actual knowledge,' he says. 'You . only get a month between when they call you and when you have to go out . for the show. So I said, 'What's the strategy that'll serve me best on . the show?' It seems that people don't actually think about the strategy . of the game itself as much as they do about the knowledge.' 'I . quickly found stories about former champions like Roger Craig and David . Madden and Chuck Forrest who've bucked the tradition of starting at the . top of each category and slowly going down and achieved great success . in the game.' 'There's no . logical reason to do that -- if you are able to take your opponents by . surprise and keep them guessing and on their toes about what the next . clue is going to be, you gain a major advantage over them. One of the . few parts of the game you actually have any control over is your power . to select the next question after answering a question correctly,' he . told MailOnline. Arthur has been tweeting his performance each night on his Twitter account @arthur_effect and through Facebook.","Arthur Chu, a 30-year-old from Ohio, angered Jeopardy! purists with his unconventional style of play .

A four-year-old girl who was allegedly murdered by her mother's boyfriend was strangled with a power cord, beaten with a wooden rod, bitten and sexually abused, a court heard this week. Teghan Skiba died in July 2010 from blunt force trauma to the head at hospital in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Her body was covered bite marks that tore off flesh and bruising, the court was told on Wednesday. Jonathan Douglas Richardson, 25, her mother's boyfriend of six months, faces the death penalty over the child's brutal death. He faces additional charges of felony child abuse, kidnapping and sexual offense. Scroll down for video . Teghan Skiba, aged four, was allegedly murdered in 2010 by her mother's boyfriend who is accused of torturing and sexually abusing her . Jonathan Douglas Richardson, 25, (left) is facing the death penalty over the torture, sexual abuse and murder of his girlfriend Helen Reye's (right) four-year-old daughter . Prosecutors said that Richardson tortured the four-year-old for ten days while her mother Helen Reyes was out of the state for Army Reserves' training. The 25-year-old took the child to hospital on June 16, 2010, where he claimed that she had hit her head while jumping on furniture. Doctors and nurses at the University of North Carolina hospital battled to save the child's life but she died days later from her horrific injuries. According to wral.com, Dr Jonathan Privette, assistant . chief medical examiner in Greenville, said he observed injuries to . Teghan's neck that were consistent with markings of a power cord. The doctor told the court: 'When she came to us, the brain has been damaged so severely that, and swelling was so much the brain matter was starting to come out.' The child also had 66 bite marks, bruises, whip marks and lesions covering her body. DNA from Teghan's blood was found on a wooden rod. The state expert testified that more than 30 items had evidence of the little girl's blood including underwear, pants, a sleeping bag and a pillow case. A dentist told the court that bite marks on the child's body matched Richardson's teeth. Some were so severe that the flesh was torn off, the dentist said. Helen Reyes took the stand on Thursday. She is charged with felony negligent child abuse causing serious bodily harm in connection with her daughter's death, according to ABC. She is free on bond and is yet to stand trial. She told the court on Thursday: 'I am here for Teghan, for my daughter ... to get justice for her, because that man murdered my baby.' Four-year-old Teghan died in hospital of blunt force trauma after being tortured for ten days, prosecutors said . The little girl was in the care of her mother's boyfriend when she died in July 2010 of horrific injuries . Jurors at the court in Smithfield appeared visibly upset when shown autopsy photos this week. The images caused the child's paternal grandfather to walk out of the court and her grandmother broke down in sobs. Richardson's lawyer said his client was abused as a child and has mental health problems. The accused, who has smiled often during the trial, never sexually abused the child, his lawyer claimed. The attorney described the four-year-old's death as an 'unbelievable tragedy' which the accused did not mean to happen. According to wral.com, Police Deputy Matt DeSilva wept last week as he told the court that Teghan's injuries were 'the most horrifying thing I've ever seen done to a human being - especially a child'. On the witness stand on Tuesday, Helen Reyes' sister Maira said her family didn't approve of Richardson so her sister moved out with Teghan. Authorities said the little girl was living with her mom and her boyfriend in a makeshift structure with no running water and no bathroom behind Richardson's grandparents' home. The trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:55 EST, 12 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:13 EST, 13 March 2014 . A New Jersey cheerleader who sued her parents for child support after she moved out was today pictured leaving her family's home with her mother after returning to the house this week. In an apparent sign that the family were attempting to return to normality after their embarrassment, Rachel Canning, 18, climbed into her car to head to school on Thursday while her mother Elizabeth climbed into a separate vehicle. They were followed by her father Sean and a younger sibling. Rachel returned to the . Morris County home with her tail between her legs on Tuesday night after a judge took a very dim view of her lawsuit demanding her parents pay child support, college tuition and other expenses last week. Her parents had claimed that their daughter ran off . in October to stay with friends because she refused to abide by . rules they had put in place, including to stop dating her boyfriend. Scroll down for video . Together: Rachel Canning, the teenager who sued her parents for child support, is pictured with her mother Elizabeth outside their New Jersey home on Thursday after returning home . Back to normal? A judge denied an emergency order to require the parents to pay child support . Though Canning went to court hoping to shame her parents into paying her child support after kicking her out for failing to abide by their rules, she was the one who took the brunt of criticism - both from her parent's lawyers and the judge himself. Last week, the judge said Rachel had given her mom and dad, Sean: ‘The proverbial f you’. 'Have you ever in your experience seen such gross disrespect for a parent? I don’t see it in my house,' Family Division Judge Peter Bogaard said. He also warned he must consider the 'slippery slope' where 'we open the gates for a 12-year-old to sue for an Xbox, a 13-year-old to sue for an iPhone… what about a 15-year-old asking for a 60 inch TV?' 'Happy families': The Canning family headed out for the school run on Thursday morning . School run: Rachel's father, Sean, and sister headed out from the home separately on Thursday morning . Stress: The judge who dismissed the case said the ordeal had affected her younger siblings . Back to the books: Rachel also requested a legal guardian following the case - but it was denied . Despite the mother and daughter's attempt at playing happy families on Thursday, Rachel's attorney had requested a court-appointed legal guardian for the girl - which was promptly denied. 'Just a few days ago, Rachel Canning . indicated she could not go back home with her parents and she required a . promise of some financial assistance going forward,' attorney Tanya Helfand wrote. 'Now, after speaking with her mother yesterday, she said she is waiving . her complaint and is receiving no promises or consideration in return.' But she said Elizabeth and Sean Canning should now be responsible for paying for a legal guardian for their daughter, who had branded her parents abusive, the New Jersey Star-Ledger reported. 'A psychologist certified that the parents are abusive. School faculty certified that the parents abuse the child,' Helfand wrote. Reconciliation: Rachel Canning has apparently . come to her senses and returned to her parents' home after their very . public falling out after she took them to court to pay for her when she . ran away . Back home: Rachel's parents have welcomed her back to their Lincoln Park, New Jersey home (pictured last week) But Family Division Judge Peter Bogaard - last week refused an emergency order to require the couple to pay - denied the application. On . Wednesday afternoon, the lawyer representing Rachel's parents held a . press conference confirming that the family was reunited on Tuesday . evening, but would not say what had sparked it. 'My . clients will be known for this for quite some time... As far as my . clients are concerned it's over, it's done,' attorney Angelo Sarno said. 'Rachel's back home.' 'This is a long process, it's only the beginning,' he said according to the Daily Record. 'This . is a private matter. It should have never been brought to the court's . attention. It should have never been brought to the public.' Mr . Sarno added that the family wishes for the matter to remain private . from now on, but felt the pressure to address their reunion in case it . came out later. Speaking out: Angelo Sarno, the attorney who represented Mr and Mrs Canning in the ordeal, spoke about the reunion Wednesday at a press conference . Welcoming her back: Elizabeth and Sean Canning, seen during the court hearing, have apparently reached a settlement with their daughter but her lawyer said that no financial incentive was given . 'Her . return home is not contingent on any financial and/or other . considerations,' Mr Sarno said in an earlier statement released . Wednesday. 'They're not athletes, they're not actors. They didn't ask for this attention... Please respect the Canning's privacy.  It's ancient history, it's done... This is a happy situation.' He said that while they are happy that it is now resolved, their two other children have been affected. 'Nothing good can come from this,' Mr Sarno said. The . ordeal is not entirely over, however, as the judge scheduled an April . court date to consider the over-arching question of whether the Cannings . are obligated to financially support their adult daughter. Judge . Peter Bogaard read an expletive-laden and vicious voice message left by . Rachel to her mother, in which she said: 'I wanna s*** all over your . face'. 'Spoiled': The judge in her case was one of Rachel's most vocal critics asking how it had come to this . Emotional: Both Sean and Elizabeth Canning began crying in the courtroom  as their lawyers defended their actions, explaining that they had to enforce their rules with their often rebellious child . In shocking legal documents submitted to the court, the honor-roll student said her parents’ behavior contributed to her developing an eating disorder at a young age and saw her weight plummet down to 92 pounds. She also said that her father had an 'inappropriate affection' for her. A Department of Children and Families . investigation cleared Mr Canning of any claims of abuse, with Rachel's . parents claiming an official assigned to the case came to the conclusion . she was just 'spoiled'. But she argued that since her parents have a combined yearly income of between $250,000 and $300,000 and she is entitled to $654-a-week in child support. Her parents have also refused to pay $6,000 owed in school fees for her Catholic High School. Her parents claim their daughter ran off . to stay with friends when she turned 18 because she refused to abide by . rules they had set down, including to stop dating her boyfriend. Friend in some kind of need: Rachel was seen with her friend Jaime Inglesino, whose family took her in and paid for her legal fees . Starring each other down: Sean Canning and Rachel exchange tense glances during their day in court . But the judge clearly took a dim view of the lawsuit. He said: 'What kind of parents would the Cannings be if they didn’t try to set down some strict rules? 'I'm not going to put myself in anyone's shoes, he's (father Sean) trying to raise a child. It's clear to me all the positive qualities Rachel obviously has, in terms of sports and academics, but I’m not going to step on a father for how he tries to get his child on the right tracks when she has obviously come off the tracks, to put it mildly.' When summing up later he denied all immediate financial claims, including monthly maintenance, private school payments and legal fees. Through the hearings, it was revealed that she previously threatened to sue a teacher for kicking her out of the Homecoming dance because he thought she was drunk. Trying to excuse the suit: The 18-year-old has offers to attend several colleges and is an . accomplished cheerleader and lacrosse player who hopes to one day be a . biomedical engineer . Princess: Rachel even accused her mother of being the cause of her bulimia, claiming that Mrs Canning had called her 'porky' and 'fat'. Mrs Canning because she tried to help, Rachel developed a 'hatred' towards her . Bragging: Rachel was heard bragging by teachers that she had a bottle of Everclear. They searched her car, didn't find any and the teacher who hauled her into an office was convinced she was drunk . Senior tutor William Schilling spotted Rachel out in the parking lot with a group of boys – including her boyfriend Lucas Kitzmiller – and thought they were acting suspiciously. Earlier in the evening Rachel, now 18, had apparently been heard loudly boasting that she had Everclear, a brand of vodka. Her pleas for immediate financial assistance were denied in a hearing at Morris County Court on Tuesday, but Judge Peter Bogaard set a trial date for April 22. Rachel’s controversial legal battle is being funded by the father of her best friend, millionaire lawyer Jon Inglesino. The Cannings believe he is enabling their daughter's behavior and encouraging her to take the matter to court. Throughout the trial, she was living in her friend's large mansion in Rockaway Township, New Jersey.","Rachel Canning returned home on Tuesday night following a conversation with her mother, just days after judge took dim view of her lawsuit .

The mother of astronaut Sally Ride has revealed her ten-year battle to free a friend from prison following a staggering case of injustice which saw an innocent woman locked up for 17 years. Gloria Killian was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 32 years to life in 1985 for a murder she first heard about on the evening news. An elderly couple, Ed and Grace Davies were shot in 1981 during a robbery of six cases of silver at their home in Sacramento, California. Mr Davies died while Mrs Davies, who had been shot in the head, managed to crawl from her home and survived. Scroll down for video . Joyce Ride (pictured left), the mother of astronaut Sally Ride, spent $100,000 to help free Gloria Killian (right) who was locked up for 17 years for a murder she did not commit . The murders were committed by Stephen DeSantis and his cousin Gary Masse. An anonymous tip-off named DeSantis and Masse, sparking a huge police hunt. When officers tracked down Masse's wife Joanne, she told them that a woman named Gloria had orchestrated the robbery. Mr Davies was a customer at the coin shop where Gloria Killian, then a 35-year-old law student, worked. None of this information was known to Ms Killian when police asked her to the station to answer questions about the murders. Within hours, she found herself arrested and charged with capital murder. However after almost five months in jail, the case against the 35-year-old was dismissed on lack of evidence. Meanwhile, Masse had been convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole. On . the day he began that sentence, he called the district attorney and . said that he would testify against Killian in exchange for 25 years . inside. Gloria Killian, from California, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 32 years to life in 1985 for a murder she first heard about on the evening news. Killian, who had no criminal past and protested her innocence, was tried, convicted and sentenced to 32 years to life - despite the fact DeSantis said at his trial that the woman had nothing to do with the murder and robbery. Each appeal Ms Killian lodged was lost. For a time, she faced the possibility of the death penalty until a change in the law in 1983 saw the option vetoed for murder accomplices. In an interview with the American Public Media last year, she said: 'The worst was about seven years in. It . happens to lifers between five and seven years. 'I guess reality hits you . in the face. You lose all hope. You lose everything.' Killian spent the years using her own legal education to help others fight their cases at the California Institution for Women prison at Chino. It was here, in the early 1990s, that she met Joyce Ride, the mother of the first woman in space Sally Ride. Mrs Ride had dedicated her life to helping women behind bars and visited Chino through organization Friends Outside. Mrs Ride, a Californian housewife, said that, at first, her daughter Sally could not understand why she was visiting prisons. Mrs Ride, who is now 90, met Ms Killian when she worked with her on ways to help victims of domestic abuse in prison. After a year of conversations, Mrs Ride finally asked what had put Ms Killian in jail. On hearing the story, the housewife said that she felt profoundly that Killian was innocent. She told CNN: 'I'm annoyed by injustice. Profoundly annoyed. This was clearly an injustice.' Despite protests from the prisoner, Mrs Ride started financing a private investigation and legal battle. In total, it cost Mrs Ride $100,000 of her own money, with the elderly widow selling stocks to pay lawyers. The investigation was triumphant - a letter emerged which exposed Masse's testimony as bogus in order to further his own leniency deal. Killian's prosecutor did not share this letter with the defense at the original trial. The prosecutor against Ms Killian, . Christopher Cleland, was 'admonished' for failing to disclose the . vital evidence - an unclear punishment at best. Another letter came to light - where Masse admitted 'he lied [his] ass off on the stand'. Without Masse's sworn testimony, the case was baseless and the murder conviction against Killian was overturned. Ms Killian was released from prison in 2002 and Mrs Ride, then in her 70s, was waiting to pick her up at the gate. Ms Ride told CNN: 'Seeing her walk out was a really great joy. It was like a load was lifted off my shoulders.' A decade on, the women share a home in Claremont, California along with a third woman that Ms Killian made friends with in prison. Since her release, Ms Killian has founded the Action Committee for Women in Prison and shares her painful life story. At 90 years old, Mrs Ride still makes trips behind the walls of prisons to help female prisoners.","Gloria Killian was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in 1985 for the murder of Ed Davies .

Jeopardy! champ Arthur Chu, who won big money while taking heat for his renegade style, has been defeated. Chu . finished in third place with zero dollars on Wednesday's edition of the . syndicated quiz show. He had reigned for 12 days. His total winnings . were $297,200. 'A great run,' summed up host Alex Trebek. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Evil genius: Arthur Chu's reign over Jeopardy has come to an end after 11 straight victories on the long-running quiz show . Champ: Diana Peloquin the woman who unseated Chu, who angered Jeopardy purists with his unconventional game strategy . Chu was unseated by Diana Peloquin of Ann Arbor, Mich., who led for the day with $15,700. Chu . had struggled for much of the show when, in Final Jeopardy, he risked, . and lost, his entire day's bankroll - $6,400 - on the question: 'He was . the last male monarch who had not previously been Prince of Wales.' Only Peloquin had the correct response: George VI. The . 30-year-old Chu, a resident of Broadview Heights, Ohio, has described . himself on Twitter as 'mad genius, comedian, actor and freelance . voiceover artist.' He . applied a 'mad genius' approach to Jeopardy! brinkmanship. He ditched . the time-honored practice of polishing off each category's questions one . by one. Instead, he took a hopscotch approach to his category choices, . which tended to keep his opponents off-kilter. Defence: Mr Chu spoke out against outraged Twitter users, admitting he values $10,000 more anyway . A little bit different: Arthur Chu, 30, (right) Jeopardy's latest and greatest star, has used Jeopardy game theory to become nightly must-see TV. But his unorthodox methods have made him a polarizing figure . Nice gift: Arthur Chu celebrated turning 30 with the announcement of his third Jeopardy win his accumulated winnings going up to $80,000 . He . also concluded that the bottom rows of the game board are most likely . to contain the hidden Daily Doubles, and he played accordingly. Chu's . strategy fueled indignation from Jeopardy! traditionalists, who . contended that such an aggressive style was somehow unsportsmanlike and . exhibited a lack of respect for the game. Chu . 'rejected the unwritten rule that the guy or gal with the most facts . wins,' said On the Media host Brooke Gladstone on an episode of the . public radio show last month, 'and replaced it with the appalling idea . that you can outwit your opponent with the wily application of game . theory.' It was a style . much different from that of legendary know-it-all Ken Jennings, who a . decade ago set a Jeopardy! record with 74 consecutive victories while . winning $2.5 million. Knowing his weakness: In his second game, Arthur Chu he immediately admitted that he knew very little about sports, and wagered only $5 . Chu, a 30-year-old Ohio insurance . compliance analyst, who does freelance voiceovers, spent a month . studying the quiz where people guess the questions to answers that pop . up on the screen. When . he first appeared on the show earlier this year, he baffled opponents . by picking squares at random and betting strange amounts on his answers, . rather than moving down the board in a straight line. Arthur . calls the strategy, which aims to disarm his opponents, Forrest Bounce, . after successful 1980s player Chuck Forrest who also 'bounced' around . the board. His controversial strategy helped him win 12 times in a row. The strategy sparked outrage across social media, as viewers accused Mr Chu of 'unsportsmanship'. But Mr Chu dismissed the furor, telling Fox News: 'Like any game, strategy plays a big role.' Arrgh: Arthur's game-play tactics appear to delight and frustrate viewers in equal measure . Tactics: Part of Chu's strategy is to pick the highest value questions first where more of the Daily Double questions are hidden . He . added: 'I can't change your impression of me but, again, we're playing . for money. Between $10,000 and getting haters on Twitter, $10,000 is . more important to me.' The . so-called 'evil genius', as dubbed by angry Twitter users, has also . received support from the show's host Megyn Kelly, who said Arthur . 'seems to get' the concept of winning. In the game, three contestants stand behind lecterns with a buzzer, a screen and a light pen. They . are presented with answers to questions on a range of topics - history, . science, arts, popular culture, literature, and languages - and must . guess what was asked to reach them. Each . category has five clues, ranked in order of difficulty. For every . correct answer, the player wins the value of the square - the easiest is . $200, the hardest is $1,000. Playing to win: Chu went out of his way and jumped around the board to find as many Daily Doubles as possible . There . are also 'Daily Doubles', where a contestant can stake as much money as . they want on a pot luck question in the hope of doubling it. Arthur is quick and confident with his answers, darting from a $1,000 question to $200 for seemingly no reason. But he has received a mixed reception from viewers with some sites such as Philly.com are calling him a 'hero', whilst others blogs like BarStool describe him as a 'mad genius'. Before appearing on the show, Arthur claims he studied the mechanics of the gameshow that has been running for 30 years. Love him or hate him? Some of the shows' fans admire Arthur Chu¿s game strategy . 'I . decided pretty early on, you know, I'm not going to be able to learn . all the things I don't know in terms of actual knowledge,' he says. 'You . only get a month between when they call you and when you have to go out . for the show. So I said, 'What's the strategy that'll serve me best on . the show?' It seems that people don't actually think about the strategy . of the game itself as much as they do about the knowledge.' 'I . quickly found stories about former champions like Roger Craig and David . Madden and Chuck Forrest who've bucked the tradition of starting at the . top of each category and slowly going down and achieved great success . in the game.' 'There's no . logical reason to do that -- if you are able to take your opponents by . surprise and keep them guessing and on their toes about what the next . clue is going to be, you gain a major advantage over them. One of the . few parts of the game you actually have any control over is your power . to select the next question after answering a question correctly,' he . told MailOnline. Arthur has been tweeting his performance each night on his Twitter account @arthur_effect and through Facebook. Interesting play: Wednesday's game was a wild one, where Arthur Chu went down to zero during Double Jeopardy after missing a Daily Double, only to surge back into the lead before the ultimate wager . Generous: Chu's most interesting move so far was on Wednesday's show, when he entered Final Jeopardy in the lead and intentionally wagered so that he might tie with another player, Carolyn Collins .","Arthur Chu angered Jeopardy! purists with his unconventional style of play .

If you’ve ever wondered what happens to your bag when you bid it farewell at an airport check-in desk, then here’s your chance to go behind the scenes. MailOnline has been granted exclusive access at Terminal 5 of London Heathrow Airport to Europe’s biggest single-terminal baggage handling system. There are 30 miles of conveyors at Heathrow - with 2.8 miles of tunnels, 44 baggage reclaim belts and around 53million bags processed every year. Scroll down for videos . On the move: Bags that arrive more than three hours before their flight are destined for the Heathrow T5 bag store, which can hold almost 4,000 at any one time . In storage: Once the flight time nears at London Heathrow Airport, the bags are put back in to the system to make their journey to the aircraft . Complex: The baggage system at T5 of the airport in South-West London can manage up to 12,000 bags a day . Baggage: The structure at T5 of London Heathrow is made up of a large conveyor belt-based handling system overlaid with a fast-track network . Behind the scenes: MailOnline has been granted exclusive access at Heathrow Airport T5 to Europe's biggest single-terminal baggage handling system . Huge: There are 30 miles of conveyors at Heathrow - with 2.8 miles of tunnels, 44 baggage reclaim belts and around 53million bags processed every year . Improvements: Almost six years ago in March 2008, around 70 flights were cancelled on the first day of BA's move to the £4.3billion terminal . The structure at T5 in South-West London is made up of a large conveyor belt-based handling system overlaid with a fast-track network. Bags are entered into the system by airline staff at check-in desks, which feed a pair of tilt-tray sorters that deliver bags to the baggage hall. Luggage is then transferred to containers by airline baggage staff at Heathrow and driven to the aircraft for manual loading. A fast-track underground system can deliver time-critical bags to individual heads of stands, and Terminal 5 also has an early bag store. Up to 4,000 bags checked in three hours prior to a departure can be stored in this facility in the basement and held until called out for a flight. Airline agents at check-in attach a luggage tag to the bag, with a unique barcode and ten-digit number which has the bag’s destination and route. On the move: Bags travel on the conveyer belt in little carts in Heathrow's Western Interface Building, which connects T5 to T3 . Big distance: The tunnel which connects T5 to T3 in the Western Interface Building is the longest inter-terminal transfer tunnel in Europe . Project: Heathrow is in the process of developing a new T3 baggage system, which when complete will be the most advanced integrated baggage facility in Europe . Along they go: The new T3 baggage system will increase the terminal's baggage handling capacity from 5,200 to 7,200 bags per hour . Technical: Bags coming in to the new T3 baggage system will be sorted automatically by size, weight and flight number. They are then taken to be loaded onto containers . Movements: The photographs give an insight to those who have ever wondered what happens to your bag when you bid it farewell at an airport check-in desk . Piled up: State-of-the-art devices load the flight containers by scanning each bag to make sure they are positioned to make the best possible use of space . The bag is then read by a barcode . scanner and routed through the network of conveyors to a collection . chute for processing by baggage handling staff. It passes through X-ray machines and other security devices, before a . baggage handler scans the bag’s barcode tag at the collection chute. This . links each item of luggage to the passenger list. The handler then . loads bags onto carts, which are driven out to the aircraft for loading . in the hold. When it comes . to transfer bags, these are unloaded and placed in the baggage system, . where they are scanned, screened and sorted for reloading. Bags . coming in from other terminals which need to go onto T5 - or vice-versa . - are automatically funnelled through the new Western Interface Building. On the ground: A British Airways truck with containers full of baggage  - which have been on a long journey since they were checked in - prepares to load a plane . Nearing the end of its airport journey: Ground staff wearing fluorescent jackets prepare to load a British Airways plane with a container . Arrivals: After flight the bags make the return journey through the baggage system at Heathrow and are ready to be picked up by passengers . Collections: A £26million tunnel was built to try to ensure every passenger at the airport was reunited with their baggage regardless of which terminal they fly to . Getting ready to fly: British Airways Boeing 747 aircraft are prepared prior to take off from Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 in South-West London . The terminal became synonymous with lost luggage when it first opened, with British Airways losing 270,106 bags in the first three months of 2008. But the £26million tunnel was built to try to ensure every passenger at the airport was reunited with their baggage regardless of which terminal they fly to. The 1.1-mile link runs under the Terminal 5 airfield and links up with Terminal 1 and 3. Terminal 1 and 4 are already linked by a tunnel, built in 1997. Almost six years ago in March 2008, around 70 flights were cancelled on the  first day of BA's move to the £4.3billion terminal. Then about 28,000 items of luggage went missing over the next few weeks. The disruption was caused by glitches in the baggage handling system.","MailOnline granted exclusive access in London to Europe's biggest single-terminal baggage handling system .

Denies murder: Ammaz Qureshi, 35, is on trial charged with the killing of a one-year-old in Norway . A British accountant has claimed he tried to stop the abuse that led to his lover killing her child live on Skype 1,100 miles away. Ammaz Qureshi told a court in Norway that he had been 'shocked' when he heard the mother Yasmin Chaudhry, 28, filled the mouth of her 22-month-old daughter Huaina with chilli. The 35-year-old is accused of telling the baby's mother, 28-year-old Yasmin Chaudhry, to submerge the child in a bucket of water after the child interrupted their online chat. But the arried accountant, of Pinner, north London, has denied that he had instructed her to discipline the girl. The pair both went on trial in Oslo charged with premeditated murder and assault. 'I thought it was hideous,' he said. 'It was not a punishment, but because it was funny. The baby made a face and its eyes filled with tears.' Qureshi allegedly instructed her to hold the baby by the ankles and dunk her head into a bucket of water. After the girl was submerged the second time, she lost consciousness, after which Chaudhry called an ambulance. She died the next day in hospital. Qureshi claimed that rather than encourage Chaudhry to do this, he had been appalled when it happened. 'I was stunned,' he told the court. '""This must never do again, it is completely wrong,"" I said. ""She's just a baby.""' He has denied all the charges as 'completely erroneous', TheLocal.no reported. 'The picture is drawn of me so far in this trial is entirely false, and I will try to show this as best I can,' he told the court on Wednesday. The pair, whose calls were monitored by the authorities, also stand accused of gagging the infant with adhesive tape, giving it cold showers and slapping it around the face. Qureshi was introduced to Chaudhry by her brother in London in February 2010. Accusations: District Attorney Cecilie Schløsser Møller says Qureshi 'anticipated' the little girl's death . Control: Qureshi is accused of masterminding months of abuse against the child before her death in October 2010, as he stayed in touch with his mistress via online chats and texts . Qureshi, 35, is said to have told the baby's mother, 28-year-old Yasmin Chaudhry, to submerge her one-year-old daughter in a bucket of water after the child interrupted their Skype chat . After she returned to Oslo two months later, they continued their relationship by text and over the Internet. Oslo District Attorney . Cecilie Schlosser Moller told Norway's TV2 before the trial: 'She was . subjected to physical violence during disciplining. 'In the end, it went too far and she died. 'By . submerging the girl in the bucket, they would have anticipated her . death. She was a small, defenceless girl who was subjected to extensive . abuse.' Qureshi has been in . custody in Oslo for more than a year, following his extradition to . Norway. He and Chaudhry both deny murder, but the mother has pleaded . guilty to abusing her child. She blames Qureshi - who is not the child's father - for the child's death by telling her to submerge her daughter in water. Qureshi's lawyer Vibeke Hein Baera told the court: 'He denies the accusations of premeditated murder and assault. 'My . client is baffled that he is accused of a crime committed in a country . which he - at that point in time - had never set foot in.' The trial at the Oslo District Court continues.

Jeopardy anti-hero: Though unpopular, Arthur Chu's (left) tactics again won him the game on Monday despite getting the Final Jeopardy question wrong . According to Jeopardy College champ Keith Williams, however, Chu's streak could come to an end quickly and with no warning. 'He . could easily reel off five wins this week, or get tripped up by a . tricky Daily Double or Final Jeopardy! clue,' Williams told ABC News. 'That's the beauty of Jeopardy! -- it's so unpredictable.' But Williams admits that Chu's risk averse style eliminates as much of the luck factor as possible. In . Monday's game, Chu's hardest-questions-first strategy left him with . more than four times the winnings of the second place opponent by the . game's final question. Chu lost $10,000 when he incorrectly . answered a question about a famous abolitionist of the 19th century . admired by Frederick Douglass. However, after both his opponents also failed to correctly answer John Brown, Chu and his tactics won the day. He'll be back on Tuesday's pre-taped episode to battle to maintain his status as the game's most loathed returning champion. Arthur calls the strategy, which aims . to disarm his opponents, Forrest Bounce, after successful 1980s player . Chuck Forrest who also 'bounced' around the board. The strategy sparked outrage across social media last week as viewers accused Chu of 'unsportsmanship'. No sweat: Chu missed the question about abolitionist John Brown but he'd already entered the final round with four times the winning of his nearest opponent and easily won the day . A little bit different: Arthur Chu, 30, (right) Jeopardy's latest and greatest star, has used Jeopardy game theory to become nightly must-see TV.

Typically, . contestants choose a single category and progressively move from the . lowest amount up to the highest, giving viewers an easy-to-understand . escalation of difficulty. However, . because Arthur is finding the hidden Daily Doubles, which are normally . located within the three highest-paying rungs in the categories, it . means rather than building up in difficulty, he ends up starting with . the most difficult questions. After a couple of the most difficult high-stakes questions have been answered, he moves over to another category. It can be a frustrating watch because it doesn't allow the viewer to get into each subject matter and viewers aren't given enough to time to get in a rhythm or fully comprehend the new subject area but Arthur defends accusations that he is being 'unsportmanlike.' Contestants often avoid topics they . unsure on, Arthur was playing tactically: if he lost, the most it would . cost him was $5, and either way, it would take the Daily Double out of . play for everyone else in the game. Host Alex Trebek and the audience giggled when the question came, Arthur immediately blurted out 'I don't know.' It . wasn't a waste of a Daily Double, as he kept that question out of the . hands of the other contestants. Winning in Jeopardy just means beating . the other two, and his strategy made that possible. Other haters online dislike Arthur for his incessant buzzer-clicking but Arthur defends his gameplay. 'There's . no logical reason for most people to play the game the way they do it - . start at the top of one category and then go all the way down until you . finish it,' Arthur says. 'The only control you have in the game is . the ability to pick where the next question is gonna be.

"By . Jack Doyle . and Chris Greenwood . PUBLISHED: . 06:14 EST, 21 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:07 EST, 21 October 2013 . Senior judge: Nigel Sweeney QC said it was 'not appropriate' to hand out a whole life sentence . A senior judge who refused to sentence a triple killer to die in prison because of his human rights found himself on a collision course with the Government last night. Ian McLoughlin, 55, butchered Good Samaritan Graham Buck, 66, while on day release in July from an earlier jail term for murder. But Mr Justice Sweeney yesterday said it was ‘not appropriate’ to hand out a whole life sentence because of a European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) decision earlier this year. The judge also indicated that a second . killer in an unrelated case, Ukrainian extremist Pavlo Lapshyn, who . yesterday admitted murdering an elderly Muslim man, would not be given a . whole life term when he is sentenced on Friday. His . comments ignited a row over who decides sentencing policy, and sparked a . rebuke from Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, who said the public . expected whole life tariffs for  the most serious offenders. Mr . Grayling, who is also Lord Chancellor, said: ‘The domestic law on this . has not changed. We are considering the Government’s response to the . ECHR’s recent ruling, but this in no way alters that fact and courts . should continue to impose whole life tariffs where they wish to do so.’ Whitehall . sources suggested the judge had ‘got it wrong’ by following the letter . of the Strasbourg ruling before it had been considered by ministers and . Parliament. In July, the Strasbourg court said ‘life means life’ sentences were a breach of Article 3, the protection against inhuman and . degrading treatment. Terrible crime: Double murderer Ian John McLoughlin, above left, has admitted killing Graham Buck, 66 who had gone to help his neighbour . Victim: Convicted paedophile Frances Cory-Wright's screams for help were heard by Mr Buck, who then lost his life intervening in a robbery . At the time, Mr Grayling said the  ruling was a ‘terrible day for British justice’. Following the judgment, ministers were given six months to decide how they will respond. Last . night Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘A toxic mix of Strasbourg case-law . and the Human Rights Act is infecting our court system, with the result . that dangerous murderers are being given the chance of release, when we . should be locking them up and throwing away the key.’ McLoughlin . killed Mr Buck on the first day he was eligible for day release during a . 25-year sentence for murder. Mr Buck intervened to stop him robbing his . vulnerable elderly neighbour in their Hertfordshire village. McLoughlin . had already served a long sentence for manslaughter after a hammer . attack on a gay man almost 30 years ago. Sentencing him at the Old . Bailey to life in prison, with a recommendation that he serve a minimum . of 40 years, the judge said: ‘It is incumbent on me to pass a sentence . that is compliant with the Convention  [on human rights] if I can and it . is not appropriate to impose a whole life term.’ Family man: Graham Buck, 66, who died in the latest killing, is circled in a family photo . Heartbroken: Karen Buck, pictured reading a statement outside the Old Bailey, said her life had been 'turned upside down' by her husband's murder . The European Court of Human Rights ruled in July that life sentences with no possibility of review are inhumane and degrading. The whole-life tariff applied in the UK to just 48 men and one woman – Rose West – whose crimes courts regard as so heinous they must never be let out. But three of them – Jeremy Bamber, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore – appealed to Europe, saying their sentences ‘undermined human dignity and destroyed the human spirit’. And the highest body of the European Court of Human Rights, the Grand Chamber, agreed with them. It said refusing the 49 any prospect of release amounted to a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture, and 'inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'. All the killers must now be allowed a review – with the prospect of release if they have been ‘rehabilitated’ and are deemed harmless. And today the full impact of this ruling was felt as Mr Justice Sweeney said that he was barred from passing a whole life term on triple murderer Ian McLoughlin because of it. The judge instead ordered that McLouglin serve a minimum of 40 years in prison. It . is believed to be the first time that a multiple killer has escaped a . whole life term because of the European ruling. The horror attack took . place within hours of McLoughlin hitching a lift from Springhill Prison, . near Aylesbury, on  Saturday, July 13, while on unsupervised day . release from a 25-year sentence for stabbing his landlord to death. He . went straight to the house of Francis Cory-Wright, 87, an Old Etonian . he met in prison two years earlier while Cory-Wright was serving a . 30-month sentence for indecently assaulting a ten-year-old boy. As . McLoughlin filled a pillowcase with family heirlooms and cash, his . victim shouted for help from a window. Mr Buck came over to investigate . and was confronted by McLoughlin, who dragged him inside the house and . slashed his throat. Mr . Buck’s wife Karen, 55, a nurse, said: ‘To kill him was the most . senseless, vicious act of violence and cowardice possible. His family . and friends will never be able to make sense of what happened.’ In . 1984, McLoughlin was jailed for ten years for manslaughter after he . killed Len Delgatty, 49. In 1992, he was jailed for life, with the . recommendation that he served 25 years, after stabbing Peter Halls to . death. This was later reduced to a 14-year minimum term. Last . night the Attorney General’s office said the sentence handed to . McLoughlin had been referred for review on the grounds it was ‘unduly . lenient’.

Cometh the New Year, cometh the rankings which lay the foundation for the first tranche of big fights in 2013. The principal corner-stone is the pound-for-pound rating of the best boxers in the world. Rarely has a year turned around so many diverse opinions as to who are the ten finest of them all. The most intense argument centres upon Manny Pacquiao and his rightful place in that listing. Still got it: Manny Pacquiao returned to winning ways with a comprehensive win over Brandon Rios . The Americans were quickest to write off the PacMan, who would also be president of the Philippines, when his robbery by Tim Bradley was followed by his carelessness in getting knocked cold by Juan Manuel Marquez. Yet even in the US they admit, however reluctantly, that Pacquiao remains the only authentic challenger to Floyd Mayweather as the master of his generation. Pacquiao reminded them of that by overwhelming tough young gun Brandon Rios in his comeback. Yet still The Ring magazine, the bible of boxing in America, and Boxing News, the gospel of the game in this country, relegate the PacMan to the bottom half of their top ten. Not this column. There is confusion, also, as to how best to acknowledge the talents of two other outstanding boxers. Wladimir Klitschko’s long reign as the multiple heavyweight champion has taken the edge off boxing’s marquee division. Guillermo Rigondeaux, arguably the most gifted amateur of all time, has turned pro late after leaving his native Cuba. Thus he has continued in the classical style which he does best and has quickly become the dominant figure at super-bantamweight. Even so he is criticised for failing to excite the crowds – and more importantly the TV moguls – by descending into brawls against technically inferior opponents. Just as it is no fault of Klitschko’s that they can find no-one to beat him, so Rigondeaux deserves admiration for his mastery of the noble art of self-defence. Yet he is begrudged recognition for skills similar to those of Floyd Mayweather, who is everyone’s No 1. Andre Ward is also more esoteric than exciting but he, like Mr Money, is up there in all the rankings. But then he too is American. Skills: Guillermo Rigondeaux is technically an excellent boxer - like heavyweight king Wladimir Klitschko (R) Untouchable: Floyd Mayweather cemented his position as the best in the world against Saul Alvarez . The lower ratings are complicated by the inactivity of the brilliant Sergio Martinez because of injury and the ease with which Marquez was outpointed by Bradley. And what do you do with Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez after his whipping by Mayweather? In my view he is edged out by Adonis Stevenson, the Haitian-Canadian Superman who has knocked out Chad Dawson, Tavoris Cloud, our own Tony Bellew and Darnell Boone – all  four in the space of the calendar year just ending. Boxing News deserve plaudits for doffing the cap of tenth place to the prize-ring’s mini maestro. Nicaraguan . Roman Gonzalez, the world light-flyweight champion, has beaten all his . 37 professional opponents, stopping 31 of them with a dynamite left, yet . is still only 26.

However, in common with The Ring, I reserve that tenth position for Britain’s only entrant in the pound-for-pound hierarchy. Carl Froch -  still love him or not after the controversy of his ninth round stoppage of George Groves -  remains the standard bearer for boxing in this country and a world champion who has taken on all the top super-middleweights on the planet. But what price Amir Khan if he were to pull off the mother and father of all upsets against the imperial Floyd? For comparison, here are The Ring and Boxing News rankings: . Ring: 1) Mayweather; 2 Ward; 3) Bradley; 4) W Klitschko; 5) Martinez; 6) Marquez; 7) Pacquiao; 8} Rigondeauz; 9) Alvarez; 10) Froch. Boxing News: 1) Mayweather; 2) Ward; 3) Bradley; 4) Marquez; 5) Martinez; 6) Pacquiao; 7) Rigondeaux; 8) Nonito Donaire, 9) W Klitschko; 10) Gonzalez.**Next week – the British top ten. (Both lists will then be updated at least monthly). Premature? Carl Froch stopped George Groves in their world title fight despite the challenger's protests . There is much sympathy for Britain’s Martin Murray who, after all, will not be making his third bid for a version of the world middleweight title in Monte Carlo on February 1. Yet in truth the time has come for the brake to be applied to the WBA’s nonsense of elevating their champions to ‘Super’ status, thereby allowing other contenders  to dispute so-called ‘regular’ world titles. This has been a cynical device for the WBA  to collect more sanctioning fees. It devalues the status of world champion, which is already diluted by the existence of so many alphabet bodies. Chance gone: Martin Murray (right) will not now challenge for the WBA world middleweight title in Monte Carelo . After widespread criticism, not least from this quarter, the WBA have backed away from awarding such spurious celebrity promotion to Gennady Golovkin, whose fight on that bill in the south of France against Osumanu Adama will now be a defence of his straightforward world title. Murray will still feature on the undercard, defending his ‘interim’ belt against Australia’s lightly-rated Jarrod Fletcher. Murray does deserve another title shot, after pushing both Felix Sturm and Sergio Martinez desperately close in his two previous challenges. Hopefully that will come. But for the moment he finds himself back down a lengthening middleweight queue with, at its head,  Golovkin the Kazakh knock-out merchant who stopped Murray’s fellow British contender, Matthew Macklin, in the old year. Not so Super: Gennady Golovkin will now defend his regular WBA middleweight title in February . The boxing community will be deeply sensitive to the head injuries sustained by seven-time world champion racing driver Michael Schumacher. The hard old game drastically modernised its medical procedures after Michael Watson suffered severe brain trauma at the climax of his world title fight with Chris Eubank in 1991. A failure to supply oxygen in the ring, as soon as he collapsed, became the focal point of Watson’s subsequent claim for compensation. However, the speed with which Watson was transferred to hospital enabled renowned neuro-surgeon Peter Hamlyn to operate only 28 minutes after the event. Catalyst for change: Michael Watson suffered severe brain trauma after his fight with Chris Eubank in 1991 . Warning: Boxing has since overhauled its medical procedures after Watson was not given oxygen immediatley . That alerted boxing to what Hamlyn labelled ‘the golden hour.’  He stressed that surgery within those precious 60 minutes saved Watson’s life and made possible his long, painful but eventually miraculous recovery from total  blindness, paralysis and deafness, to the point where he was able to slowly complete a London marathon. Worryingly,  it took significantly longer than that before Schumacher underwent the procedure to remove blood clots and reduce the potentially fatal swelling and pressure of the brain within the confines of the skull. Although a helicopter reached Schumacher on an Alpine ski slope only eight minutes after he fell and crashed his head against a rock, it flew him initially to a small clinic nearby, . He was conscious at first but reports that he was in an ‘agitated state’ suggest it may have been a mistake not to take him directly to the main hospital in Grenoble. On the slopes: Michael Schumacher - pictured in 2005 - is fighting for his life after hitting his head . That did not happen until more than an hour-and-a-half after the accident, subsequent to him losing consciousness.  Further time must have elapsed as the surgeons there prepared to operate, even if they did not wait for the arrival of his personal specialist from Paris. Ironically, as Schumacher lies in an induced coma, only time will tell if those time lapses were critical. The wide world of sport, boxing very much included, will be praying they were not.","Floyd Mayweather remains peerless at the top of any pound-for-pound list .

Half a century after Karl Lagerfeld first drew her in a blue tunic and a plaid, buckled coat, the woman in a fashion sketch for the House of Tiziani still seems ready to saunter off the page and into the street. Other women in sketches along the same wall at Palm Beach Modern Auctions are drawn in outfits just as chic, but the one by Lagerfeld stands out in a crowd — much as the meticulously groomed head designer and creative director for Chanel does himself. 'There's attitude in her,' said Rico Baca, auctioneer and co-owner of the West Palm Beach auction house. Autographed: One of Karl Lagerfeld's few signed drawings from his time at Tiziani in the 60s hangs at the Modern Auction house in West Palm Beach. Most in-house designers are not allowed to sign their work . Baca hopes that attitude and the Lagerfeld signature attracts buyers to a Jan. 11 auction of an archive of sketches for Tiziani designs. Fashion legend: Lagerfeld, 80, pictured in Berlin in November, has been the creative head of Chanel since 1983 . In the 1960s, the Rome-based Tiziani . designed movie costumes and clothing for Elizabeth Taylor and other . celebrities. It also was one of the European fashion houses where . Lagerfeld freelanced, early in his career as a designer. Lagerfeld built his fashion legend through tenures at Chloe, Fendi, Chanel and his own eponymous brands. And the German-born designer is recognized worldwide for his white ponytail, black sunglasses and black-and-white attire that includes high, starched collars. He also has branched out into photography and film directing and has published a unique diet book after shedding more than 90 pounds to fit into clothes cut for younger, slimmer male models. At Tiziani, though, he was a hired . hand, a young ready-to-wear designer among dozens of others doing . similar work for bigger houses. The . details Lagerfeld added to sketches for Taylor and other models — . earrings, a flowing hem, a jacket's trim or a specific shade of eye . shadow — show the creativity of a young designer making his mark. 'He finished off the fit,' Baca said. The sketches more than illustrate a designer's vision for an outfit. They're really blueprints used to . communicate specific information to the team that produces each outfit — . from the designer to the patternmaker, fabric buyers, salespeople and . other staff. Sixties styles: Several of the Karl Lagerfeld drawings for Tiziani that will be auctioned on January 11 . A-list clients: A glimpse of the drawings that Lagerfeld did for Elizabeth Taylor . The Tiziani archive, which includes more than 300 drawings, . highlights the shift in fashion from haute couture worn only by wealthy . women to ready-to-wear designs that could be produced in large . quantities at lower prices. Tiziani's . founder, Evan Richards, kept Lagerfeld's designs and sketchbooks . together with other work produced for the fashion house in the 1960s, . and the archive was maintained by subsequent owners. Along with . memorabilia between Richards and Taylor, Lagerfeld's work is the . highlight of the auction. The sketch... and the finished gown: How Lagerfeld's drawings were realized by Tiziani's studio .

Much . in the way Lagerfeld has kept Chanel current by updating recognizable . elements of the historic French label — patent leather, quilting, its . signature chain — he put his own twist on the over--the-top looks . favored at Tiziani, Hamilton said. 'His . sketches are much younger-looking than whoever else was sketching at . the time, much freer,' said Hamilton, who has reviewed the Tiziani . archive.

'Hoarder' Philipe Brough, 54, who hid his dead mother's body in a freezer for six months as he was afraid he would be evicted from her flat, was spat on as he arrived at Portsmouth Crown Court today . A 'hoarder' hid his dead mother's body in the freezer for six months because he was afraid he would be evicted from her flat, a court heard today. Philipe Brough, 54, concealed the body of 90-year-old Louise Brough in the freezer at her home in Portsmouth, Hampshire, after she died of natural causes in February last year. He then kept it there for half a year so he could continue receiving her benefits - including her pension, income support and carer's allowance. Mrs Brough's frozen body - still dressed in nightclothes and wrapped in a sheet - was discovered by authorities in August, Portsmouth Crown Court heard. Now, Brough, who was spat on by a member of the public as he arrived at court today, has been handed an eight-month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months, after pleading guilty to preventing a lawful and decent burial of his mother. Wearing a beige suit, white shirt, and blue tie, he also confessed to failing to disclose her death to the Department for Work and Pensions in a bid to continue claiming the benefits, including £5,390 of her pension. Martyn Booth, prosecuting, said Mrs Brough, who was born in France, had moved to the flat in Tyseley Road with her son, then aged 11, in the 1970s following the death of her husband. He said that, in recent years, . Brough had given up his job and acted as a full-time carer for his mother, who had become bed-bound and was only occasionally seen out of the . flat. Concerns about the pensioner's whereabouts were raised . when Portsmouth City Council asked her and her son to temporarily move out of the property as work needed to be carried out, the court heard. Residents later told council staff that . they had not seen Mrs Brough - who suffered from a number of medical . problems, including dementia - for some time. Mr Booth said that Brough had appeared . 'evasive' when asked about his mother, before refusing council staff . access to the property - prompting them to call the police. Guilty: Brough (pictured, left and right, arriving at court today) concealed the body of 90-year-old Louise Brough in the freezer at her home in Portsmouth after she died of natural causes in February last year, the court heard . Earlier appearance: He then kept it there for half a year so he could continue receiving her benefits - including her pension, income support and carer's allowance. Above, Brough is pictured at an earlier court appearance . 'Brough was described [by police] as acting very much erratically and obstructively when the police were in the flat,' he said. 'He told the officers that his mother, who they plainly wanted to see, was at his aunt’s property in London. 'They . described him as seeming one moment as very calm and the next getting . irate for no reason, claiming the police were invading his mother’s . privacy by asking about her whereabouts.' Officers arrested Brough on suspicion of . murder at around 5.35pm on August 13 after discovering his mother's body . in the freezer, the court heard. Secret: Mrs Brough's frozen body - wrapped in a sheet - was discovered by police in August, the court heard . However, a post-mortem examination later revealed the elderly woman had died of natural causes. Mr Booth said police had found the . flat in Tyseley Road to be in 'a state of disarray' - adding that it was the type of place 'one would have associated with as a hoarder'. 'The flat contained a large amount of property cluttering up most of the space in . it,' he said. 'It was described as typical of the type of person one would have associated with as a hoarder.' Sentence: Brough has been handed an eight-month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months, after pleading guilty to preventing a lawful and decent burial of his mother, as well as fraud . He added: 'As they [the police] cleared items out of it, they found in the corner . of a room, hidden behind a mattress, an upright freezer which had been . covered by a large cardboard box. 'The freezer was described as being . in working order. They found it was plugged in, with the power lead concealed behind various pieces of wood on the floor. 'Industrial tape was placed across the door seals, all designed to prevent the door opening accidentally. 'When . the freezer was opened, it revealed the dead body of an elderly white . female dressed in her nightclothes. The body was described as frozen . solid and was wrapped in a duvet or sheet.' Mr Booth said Brough - who had full access to his mother's bank accounts - had found the elderly woman dead in her bed at around the end of February or beginning of March. Since then, he said the defendant had falsely claimed about £5,390 in benefits - although he had since managed to repay £2,000 of this. Matthew . Jewell, defending, said Brough had a history of depression and had . panicked when his mother had died. He said his client's primary concern was a . fear that he would lose his home following his mother’s death and he . had not set out to commit fraud. 'This is not a wicked or evil offence, it’s an offence borne of distress, depression of an emotional breakdown,' he said. Sentencing . Brough, Judge Roger Hetherington told him he believed he had acted out of an 'emotional inability to cope' with his mother's death. 'It seems that you were quite unable to cope with that and in your own terms ""panicked"",' he said. 'Part . of that panic you believe was a realisation that as a result you might . have nowhere to live, certainly in the immediate future. Mrs Brough's frozen body - still dressed in nightclothes and wrapped in a sheet - was discovered by authorities in August, Portsmouth Crown Court (pictured) heard . 'What you then did was quite extraordinary and really inexcusable. You . bundled her body, wrapped in some sort of duvet cover, into a freezer . which you then taped up with industrial tape, concealed within a . cardboard box and then blocked up with a mattress within the living area . of that flat that you and she had occupied. 'You told no one about . it and went on claiming the benefits that she would have been entitled . to and you would have been entitled to had she continued to live.' Judge Heatherington added that Brough's deception over his mother's whereabouts had been an 'aggravating' feature in the sentence. 'I cannot overlook the fact that the vast majority of people . who suffer a bereavement find themselves in a position of emotional . turmoil. 'They find it difficult to come to terms with what has happened too and do not know how best to deal with it. But a person's death has to be properly and respectfully dealt with. 'Despite the mitigation in your case, the consequence must be that the public expectation is of a prison sentence.' Brough has been handed a 12-month supervision order, ordered to pay £750 costs and enrolled on an employment training programme. He has also started to pay back the benefits he falsley claimed.","Philipe Brough hid 90-year-old mother's body in freezer in February 2013 .

A new pest-resistant maize will be approved for commercial planting by the European Commission in the coming months (stock image) Eurocrats are due to rubber-stamp the cultivation of the first genetically modified crop in nearly two decades, despite the opposition of 19 countries. A new pest-resistant maize will be approved for commercial planting by the European Commission in the coming months. It will be the first GM crop to be given the go-ahead since 1998, and only the second to be commercially grown in Europe. Critics say that tampering with the genes in crops to create ‘Frankenstein foods’ could damage natural ecosystems or even affect human health. Yesterday the representatives of 19 governments tried to block the development in the EU General Affairs Council. But because of complex voting rules, it was not enough to stop the approval. Now the application for commercial planting will go to the unelected European Commission, which is legally obliged to approve it. David Lidington, Britain’s Europe Minister, voted in favour of the application - one of just five country representatives to do so. Four abstained. Under EU rules each nation is given voting points depending on their population sizes. To block the application the representatives of roughly 75 per cent of European population needed to vote against - but only 52 per cent did so. The British Government is fiercely in favour of GM food, despite strong consumer concerns. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said last month that Europe risked ‘becoming the museum of world farming’ if it continued to oppose GM technology. Critics say that tampering with the genes in crops to create ¿Frankenstein foods¿ could damage natural ecosystems or even affect human health. Here, activists against GM crops tear up plants at a test site in Oxfordshire . Of the maize proposal, he said: ‘If approval is granted, as it should be based on the scientific evidence, then it will be the first GM food crop authorised for planting by the EU for 15 years. ‘Delays and blockages have been politically-motivated rather than based on evidence.’ The new crop - called Pioneer 1507 and developed by DuPont and Dow Chemical - is unlikely to be grown in Britain because the insects it has been bred to resist do not live in the country. European Health Commissioner Tonio Borg said extensive research had shown the crop, whose developers first applied for authorisation in 2001, was safe. DuPont Pioneer said in a statement that the EU had ‘a legal obligation to itself, to its farmers and scientists and to its trade partners’ to support the approval of safe new agricultural products. EU authorities have only ever approved two other GM crops for commercial cultivation - a different maize and a potato. The potato was later blocked by a court. Campaigners last night said the European Commission should not approve the development - despite rules which oblige it to do so because not enough countries had voted to block it. Eurocrats are due to rubber-stamp the cultivation of the first genetically modified crop - maize called Pioneer 1507 - in nearly two decades, despite the opposition of 19 countries. The new crop was developed by DuPont and Dow Chemical but is unlikely to be grown in Britain. A stock image of non-GM corn is pictured . Greenpeace agriculture policy director Marco Contiero said: ‘The Commission cannot ignore the scientific, political and legal concerns voiced by a large majority of countries, by two thirds of the European Parliament and supported by most EU citizens. ‘The European Court of Justice would very likely overturn an authorisation of this GM maize in a legal challenge, as it did with the latest Commission approval of the Amflora GM potato. ‘The Commission must learn from its mistakes and stop breaching the rules that help ensure the safety of what is grown in Europe.’ Emma Hockridge, head of policy at organic campaign group the Soil Association, said: ‘Recent research by the EU’s own safety authority has shown that the GM maize poses a risk to certain species of butterflies and moths. ‘GM crops do not benefit farmers, consumers or the environment; only a handful of seed and chemical companies.’ Liz O’Neill, director of GM Freeze, said: ‘Pioneer 1507 maize is unnecessary and unwelcome. Despite 13 years in the application process, there are still too many unanswered questions about its impact on the natural environment and potential harm to human health. ‘Now that 19 European nations have given a clear signal that they do not want Pioneer 1507 grown on their doorstep, we sincerely hope that the European Commission upholds that view by rejecting DuPont’s application.’","If approval granted the maize will be the first GM food crop authorised for planting by the EU for 15 years and only the second to be grown in Europe .

Doing an about-turn on his own pet policy London mayor Boris Johnson is now not so keen on the idea of the 'Boris Island' airport. The new transport hub was going to be built in the Thames estuary on an artificial island. Now Mr Johnson is more strongly backing a giant airport on the Isle of Grain in Kent, partly built on reclaimed land. New favourite idea: Boris has backed the four-runway 'Foster Island' (pictured) in the Thames Estuary airport, which would be capable of handling up to 180million passengers a year on the Isle of Grain in Kent . Elaborate plan: The Isle of Grain's  proposed international railway station, which would include a service to Waterloo in 26 minutes . Mr Johnson told The Sunday Times in an interview that it would 'knock the spots off' rival European airports as it would eventually serve 180 million passengers a year. The entire project would cost about £65 billion, including a new train line taking passengers to Waterloo in 26 minutes. The Boris Island plan, designed by Global firm Gensler, will remain one of three options that Mr Johnson will present to a government-backed commission this week. The proposed location for Boris Island, artificially created from landfill, would be two miles north of the Isle of Sheppey. Ferries would link the site to Kent and Essex while a railway bridge could connect it to the mainland. The third possible idea would be expanding Stansted. Crunch time: Mayor of London Boris Johnson is submitting the Isle of Grain plan to a government-backed commission today . However, Mr Johnson now says that the Isle of Grain plan has the 'greatest single potential for regeneration'. The blueprint involves an opening scheduled for 2029, requiring infrastructure improvements such as extending Crossrail and widening the M25 an extra lane in each direction for 36 miles. Mr Johnson insisted that Prime Minister David Cameron is 'open to the idea' of an estuary airport. On top of those three suggestions, Heathrow will be revealing its own plans to expand with a thrid and maybe even fourth runway. Ongoing fight: A longstanding campaign has been fought to prevent a third Heathrow runway, but if airports move to the east of the London, tens of thousands will lose their jobs . The plans to replace Heathrow have . angered many west Londoners who fear it would harm the local economy and . result in huge job loses as around 76,600 people currently work there. The committee listening to the various ideas, chaired by former Financial Services Authority chairman Sir Howard Davies, will not publish its final report until the summer of 2015. In April, Mr Johnson said that he would also like to see any future airport named after the late Baroness Thatcher.","Mayor Boris Johnson does a u-turn on his own plan for 'Boris Island' airport .

Donald Trump says he's the Republican Party's top choice to run for governor of New York, telling NBC's TODAY show on Thursday that 'Republican leaders want me to run so badly.' Trump is not running – at least not yet – but that hasn't stopped him from using the possibility as a launching pad to promote his business ventures and vent his political spleen. 'I think it can be won,' he said of the race to oust Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. But 'the Republican Party in New York is a mess,' Trump claims, giving him an easy out if the whole idea is a giant tease. Meanwhile, the multi-billionaire real estate tycoon has also left the door open for a presidential run, which some GOP insiders say would be a more logical salve for his ever-expanding ego. Scroll Down for Video . Donald Trump appeared on the TODAY show to promote his Miss USA pageant, but steered the conversation toward his political aspirations . 'There's no way ""The Donald"" would be satisfied with running just one state,' laughed a Republican operative in New Hampshire who declined to be named. 'And besides, can you imaging the great and all-powerful Trump living in Albany and giving up his Apprentice series? The mind boggles.' But Monroe County, N.Y. Republican chairman Bill Reilich told Capital New York on Thursday that Trump had 'spoken to me directly and told me that when he announces his candidacy [for governor], he's prepared to put $50 million in a bank account.' That amount would trump – pun intended – Cuomo's $33 million war chest. 'It takes some effort to amass this. That's occurring, as I understand it, now,' Reilich said. 'As soon as the filming of [The Apprentice] is complete, he's then going to focus toward the May convention.' Trump may have his sights set even higher. Clipping a microphone to his lapel has been a reliable prescription lately for an attack on the Obama White House, and few long-shot presidential candidates can command such a large stage to level his charges. '[Vladimir] Putin has eaten Obama's lunch, and therefore our lunch for a long time,' he said Thursday, complaining about a weak-willed White House that has let Russia run roughshod over parts of the old Soviet Empire. Trump is scheduled to appear at the April 12 New Hampshire Freedom Summit, . an event in the first-in-the-nation primary state that will showcase . more than a half-dozen potential GOP presidential candidates. Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah will . speak, along with former Arkansas governor and Fox News host Mike . Huckabee, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Tennessee Rep. Marsha . Blackburn. His first formal appearance on the . pre-2016 Republican speaking circuit came a week ago at the Conservative . Political Action Conference. But . his message about unemployment and U.S. weakness abroad sputtered . beneath the weight of a headline-inducing gaffe in which he referred to . the 39th U.S. president as 'the late, great Jimmy Carter.' Carter is very much alive. Trump said Thursday on NBC that Republican leaders want him to run against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo 'badly' Trump was on the TODAY show to announce that the June 2014 Miss USA event, which will air on NBC, will be held in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Trump owns the Miss Universe Organization. Miss USA is America's qualifying pageant for that global competition. He called the Pelican State's capital 'a place that really wanted us.' 'We had about 12 places that were fighting for the rights, and we just decided that's sort of the home of pageantry, it's sort of the home of the whole beauty thing. They're terrific people, and they're going to put on a great show.' 'Usually we go to Las Vegas. We never fail in Las Vegas,' he said. 'It's great, but we thought we'd move it.' Trump appeared alongside Miss USA 2013 Erin Brady, who announced that she intended to enter the entertainment industry after her reign is over. He has said he plans to decide whether or not to run for governor by the end of the week.","Trump could face a crowded Republican primary field but would have a huge advantage in name-recognition .

Most of us will be somewhat guilty of indulging in a few - OK, quite a few - celebratory cocktails while ringing in 2014 this week. But who knew how the order you place at a bar could speak volumes of your potential political leanings? According to two years of consumer data gathered from GFK MRI and analyzed by the right-leaning National Media Research Planning and Placement, voting habits can be realized according to drink choices. While the results were varied, the summary findings concluded that Democrats go for clear liquors, such as vodka and gin, while Republicans are more likely to opt for something darker, such as whiskey. What your favorite drink says about your politics: Democratic drinkers are more likely to sip Absolut and Grey Goose vodkas, while Republican tipplers are more likely to savor Jim Beam, Canadian Club and Crown Royal, according to consumer data supplied by GFK MRI . You must be a Democrat! A new survey shows that people who are more likely to be opt for clear liquor, such as vodka, would vote Democratically . And so you're a Republican? People who choose darker spirits, such as whiskey, are more likely to vote Republican, a new consumer data survey says . There were also a variety of bipartisan beverages, including Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, Malibu Coconut, Johnnie Walker Black and Segram's 7 Crown. Democrats, according to the analysis, drink more champagne and sparkling wine, the traditional drink to ring in the New Year. Researchers also looked at what likely and unlikely voters drank. According to the data, someone who chose Kendall-Jackson or Robert Mondavi wines is highly likely to vote, and they’re likely to vote Republican. Whereas someone who savors a Chateau Ste. Michelle Merlot, one of Washington State’s top producers, or Smoking Loon, are likely to cast ballots for Democrats. By comparison, the least likely voters were drinking harder stuff: Don Julio tequila, Jagermeister, Smirnoff Twist and Belvedere. The analysis tracks with both stereotypes and electoral data. The most fervent Democratic partisans drink expensive champagne and brandy, while the GOP¿s base voters drink modestly priced wine, says a new media survey by National Media, a firm that tracks demographic and consumer data . For example, older people – those who stereotypically like to enjoy a nice glass of wine – vote far more frequently than their young counterparts, those who may be mixing Jagermeister with Red Bull. Will Feltus and a team of researchers at the Republican firm used nearly 50,000 interviews from 2012 to 2013 to complete the analysis. To Feltus, the data shows that while Democrats appear to drink a wider variety of booze, Republicans are drinking stronger liquor. 'We added up the size of the bubbles (on the graph) – the blue bubbles are almost twice as large as the red bubbles,' Feltus said. However history doesn't seem to match up with the analysis. Democrats who are least likely to turn out on election day also spend heavily on high-priced booze, including Grey Goose and Absolut vodkas, and Patron tequila, according to the graph . Democratic President Harry Truman reportedly enjoyed drinking bourbon, which is supposedly a Republican beverage. The same can be said Democratic former President Lyndon Johnson, who enjoyed drinking a Cutty Sark scotch and soda on his ranch in Texas. Republican former presidents, too, didn't totally stick with the analysis. Former President Gerald Ford enjoyed a gin and tonic, while former President George H.W. Bush drank vodka martinis – both drinks on the Democratic side of the spectrum.","Consumer data gathered over two years from over 50,000 interviews has attempted to realize voting choices according to drink choices .

Murdered fusilier Lee Rigby sent a heartfelt text to his fiancée trying to cheer her up just 20 minutes before he was slain in the street. The soldier, 25, tried to cheer up his fiancée Aimee West, who was homesick in Afghanistan, telling her 'Princess, keep smiling for me.' The military policewoman said the text continued: 'I know it is hard and you really want to come home but just remember I am always there for you and I will always love you no matter what. We are on the home stretch... you will always come first in my life xxxx'. Miss West said she would always treasure that text message, and spoke of how she and Fusilier Rigby, from Middleton, had planned to get married in 2016, The Sun reported. She spoke out after Michael Adebolajo, 29, received a rare whole-life term, while Michael Adebowale, 22, was jailed for life with a minimum of 45 years at the Old Bailey. The 23-year-old said she was relieved the soldier's killers will have to suffer the 'torture' of life in prison and not the death penalty. Miss West admitted she was 'frightened' when these 'monsters' started attacking prison guards and yelling abuse at the judge, but Miss West said today it was a sign the killers had been beaten. 'It wouldn’t be torture for them to be killed, which is what they wanted. I want them to suffer and that’s what’s going to happen now,' she said.

Woolwich Barracks in south-east London on May 22 last year. They both claimed that they were ‘soldiers of Allah’ and were motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing, which they called an 'act of war'. As he was about to be jailed for life without parole Adebolajo shouted Allahu Akbhar, and Adebowale called out ‘that's a lie’ and ‘it's not a betrayal of Islam’ as the judge told them they had been radicalised. Miss West said she would always treasure the text that the fusilier sent, promising to 'always love her' Sentencing: Murderers Michael Adebolajo, who described himself as a 'soldier of Allah', attempted to decapitate Drummer Rigby while Michael Adebowale hacked at his body in the most appalling crime . Adebowale then screamed 'You (Britain) and America will never be safe'. The prisoners were dragged down to the cells - one head first – and could be heard banging on the ceilings below after being taken down as the judge condemned their 'barbaric' murder. Outside the court right-wing protesters set up gallows and demanded the return of the death penalty, which was abolished completely in 1969. Speaking about their relationship, she revealed they fell in love in August 2012 when they met at an Army Cadets training event in Wales. She said Lee would 'follow me around like a little sheep' and after they returned home he asked her out. The 25-year-old father-of-one was then estranged from his wife Rebecca, who he had his son Jack with, and was getting a divorce. The following year, before the military police woman flew away for a tour of Afghanistan, he proposed and she accepted. She told The Sun: 'He's really soppy and I'm not. He got down on one knee. I just said ""Yes"" straight away. He had asked my mum's permission before going down on his knee.' But it was while she was there that he was cruelly taken from her. Miss West is now running the Paris Marathon to raise money for the Lee Rigby Fund, which she supports and which helps military families.","Soldier tried to cheer up fiancée Aimee West who was homesick in Afghanistan with a text telling her to 'smile'

This is the bizarre moment a carer tried to disguise herself as an 81-year-old Alzheimer’s sufferer in a bid to steal £22,000 from a pensioner’s bank account. Linda Cramphorn, 47, of Whetstone, Leicestershire, wore a curly brown wig, glasses and a green hat and jacket as she walked into a Halifax branch. She managed to withdraw £400 last June while pretending to be her elderly victim - but aroused suspicions in the staff when she asked for a £22,000 banker’s draft. Scroll down for video .

It . happened right under Batman’s nose: Cramphorn (right) disguised as the . old lady, at the cashier, with a bank worker dressed up for charity . (centre) as the comic book hero, in the foreground . They alerted police who apprehended Cramphorn and her partner Sanjay Patel, 43, who maintained he was waiting for an elderly woman and that she was the OAP. Both defendants were jailed for 16 months, after admitting fraud by false representation at Leicester Crown Court yesterday. Judge Michael Pert QC described Cramphorn as a ‘conwoman’ and said: ‘This was cynical exploitation of the elderly.’ ‘You obtained work as a carer and were caring for an elderly, vulnerable lady and you took the opportunity to help yourself to various documents of hers to prove her identity and gain access to her finances. ‘You set out to bleed her account dry. Having obtained £400, Cramphorn, disguised as an old woman, attempted to obtain £22,000.’ Fraud: Linda Cramphorn, 47, walking into  Leicester Crown Court with her boyfriend Sanjay Patel, 43 . Cramphorn, who along with Patel comes from Whetstone, also carried a shopping bag and walking stick in an attempt to steal the money. She had been employed as a carer through Quorndon Care and admitted to stealing the victim’s personal documents and cheque book between February and June last year. Alan Murphy, prosecuting, confirmed his client had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2012 and needed help carrying out routine chores as her condition deteriorated. Her finances were being attended to by a relative with a power of attorney, who lives in Australia. Mr Murphy said: ‘Cramphorn went to the bank disguised as the complainant and someone who would pass as being 81. ‘The cashier thought the woman who presented as the account holder looked a bit odd. All of it was caught on the bank’s CCTV.’ The carer told bank staff she needed the money for a wedding and produced a utility bill she had taken from the pensioner. ‘The cashier was concerned as it seemed she wasn’t 81, as she was pretending to be,’ said Mr Murphy. When staff said that was insufficient identification, Cramphorn asked to withdraw £2,100 and supplied a false signature. Jailed: . Cramphorn, who managed to withdraw £400 last June while pretending to . be her elderly victim, admitted fraud by false representation at court . As she was unable to answer further security questions the money was not handed over, and she beat a hasty retreat, claiming to be unwell. Having left the pensioners saving’s account book in the bank she had to return and was subsequently arrested. On her person she had the pensioner’s cheque book, Nectar card and utility bills and a piece of paper with practice signatures of the victim’s name. The court was told Cramphorn had a criminal record but her last offence was committed as a juvenile. Patel, a warehouse worker, had previous convictions, which included obtaining and attempting to obtain services by deception, but had been out of trouble since 2000. In mitigation Olwen Davies, acting for both defendants, said: ‘It’s not disputed it involves breach of trust. There was ultimately no loss and they pleaded guilty early.’ She said Cramphorn was ‘well thought of’ at work, but said: ‘It’s surprising she got this job, given her record. ‘She suffers from mental instability and has been sectioned in the past and accepts custody is a likely outcome.’","Linda Cramphorn wears curly brown wig, glasses and green hat and jacket .

A farmer’s daughter who claims she had to stay at home and tend the cows while her teenage siblings went dancing is suing her elderly parents for a share of their £7million estate. Eirian Davies, 45, insists she was repeatedly assured by her mother and father that she would take over the family’s thriving farm and its herd of pedigree Holstein cows. She says she is owed a substantial stake in 200-acre Caeremlyn Farm for her years of toil. But Tegwyn and Mary Davies, now in their 70s, are fighting her claim at the Court of Appeal. Family at war: Eirian Davies, 45, left, says she is entitled to a stake the dairy business in Helland, Dyfed, owned by her parents Tegwyn and Mary, right, after spending more than 25 years working long hours for them . Miss Davies told an earlier court . hearing that she missed out on going to Young Farmers’ Club dances with . her two sisters as a teenager because she had to stay at home in . Whitland, Dyfed, and complete her farming chores. Her parents said her patience would one day be rewarded, she claimed. ‘They . always told me that the farm would be left to me,’ she told Judge . Milwyn Jarman QC. ‘Even on my birthday … they would say, “You will have . the damn lot one day, it will all be yours”.’ The . judge found Miss Davies had ‘established an entitlement to a beneficial . interest in the farm or farming business’ but her parents are . challenging the ruling. Timothy . Fancourt QC, representing Mr Davies, 75, and his 76-year-old wife, . argued their daughter had earned a fair income working on the farm and . was provided with ‘bed and board’. The . couple put Miss Davies through agricultural college, he said, adding: . ‘She said in terms that agriculture was her love and she wanted to be on . the farm.’ 'Not fair': Miss Davies says she worked 'extremely long hours' tending cows while her sisters went to Young Farmers' Club dances . The court heard . that even when Miss Davies worked elsewhere she failed to boost her . earnings Mr Fancourt pointed out that she only earned £5,000 as a . consultant for Slimming World in 2006. ‘So when the opportunity is there to do something else, she does worse,’ the barrister told the court. He . said there was no evidence she would have been better off had she not . worked on the farm and insisted she had suffered no ‘substantial . detriment’ by relying on anything her parents had said or done. But Leslie Blohm QC, for Miss Davies, said promises were made by the couple from 1985, when their daughter was 17. The court heard she worked ‘extremely long hours’ with the cows, sometimes unpaid. If . she complained to her parents about meagre wages, she was told the farm . would ultimately belong to her – and ‘not to kill the goose that laid . the golden egg’, Mr Blohm added. 'Golden egg': Miss Davies argues that her parents told her 'You'll have the whole damn lot one day' Although . the earlier hearing found Miss Davies had ‘walked away from the farm’ for periods between 1989 and 2008, she moved back home following a . reconciliation with her parents. Mr . Davies made a ‘representation’ that she could live rent-free for life . in a farmhouse on the estate, Mr Blohm said, and in 2009, a pledge that . she would inherit the farm was made in a draft will. But . after a final family ‘rupture’ in late 2012, her parents gave her . notice to leave the farmhouse. Possession proceedings followed, but Miss . Davies insisted she was entitled to a stake. Mr . Blohm added: ‘It is plain from the evidence that a talented, . hard-working and capable lady has spent a substantial part of her adult . life – over a period of 25 years – carrying out difficult physical work . for the benefit of her parents … on the strength of their repeated . representations that she would eventually take over the farm and . business.’ Lords Justice Richards, Underhill and Floyd will give their decision at a later date.","Parents Tegwyn, 75, and Mary, 76, always promised her farm, she claims .

The sentencing of Lee Rigby’s murderers was delayed until today after Strasbourg judges had said that whole-life tariffs with no right of review were unlawful. But last week, senior British judges defied the European Court of Human Rights ruling - leaving the judge free to decide whether Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowlale should die behind bars. Having been found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey last December, Mr Justice Sweeney gave Adebolajo, 29, a whole-life term while Adebowale, 22, was jailed for life with a minimum of 45 years. Scroll down for family statement after sentencing . Sentencing: Having been found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey last December, Mr Justice Sweeney gave Adebolajo, 29, a whole-life term while Adebowale, 22, was jailed for life with a minimum of 45 years . Leading British judges ruled last week at a specially-constituted court that murderers who commit the most ‘heinous’ of crimes can be sent to prison for the rest of their lives by sentencing judges. Backing the use of ‘life-means-life’ orders, a panel of five judges at the Court of Appeal increased the ‘unduly lenient’ 40-year minimum being served by killer Ian McLoughlin, who murdered a man while on day release, to a whole-life term. And they dismissed a challenge by Lee Newell, who murdered a child killer while in prison, against an order imposed in his case that he can never be released. The guidance from the appeal judges in London came in the wake of a decision by the European Court of Human Rights last year in an appeal by three murderers. Choice: Last week, senior British judges defied a European Court of Human Rights ruling - leaving the judge free to decide whether Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowlale (right) should die behind bars . Giving the panel's ruling, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said the court had held that the statutory scheme enacted by Parliament which enabled judges to pass whole-life orders was ‘entirely compatible’ with the European Convention on Human Rights. The ruling has confirmed the possibility of a serial killer being given a whole-life prison term when she is sentenced tomorrow. Joanna Dennehy (right), of Peterborough, pleaded guilty in November to murdering Lukasz Slaboszewski, John Chapman and Kevin Lee. She stabbed the men before dumping their bodies in March and April last year. She also admitted two attempted murders in Hereford. The 31-year-old woman is currently in custody awaiting sentence at the Old Bailey tomorrow, along with her accomplices Gary Stretch, 47, and Leslie Layton, 36, as well as a third man, 55-year-old Robert Moore. ‘Judges should therefore continue as they have done to impose whole-life orders in those rare and exceptional cases which fall within the statutory scheme. ‘Under the statutory scheme as enacted by Parliament, the Secretary of State has power to release a prisoner on licence if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner's release on compassionate grounds.’ Sentencing in a number of high-profile criminal cases had been put on hold - including the terms to be handed out to Adebolajo and Adebowale - pending the Court of Appeal's findings. The British-born extremists mowed Fusilier Rigby down in a car before hacking him to death in the street in front of horrified onlookers near Woolwich Barracks in south east London in May last year. With Adebolajo's sentencing, there are now 54 prisoners serving whole-life terms in Britain. The ruling by Lord Thomas, Sir Brian Leveson, Lady Justice Hallett, Lord Justice Treacy and Mr Justice Burnett followed a successful appeal last July to the European Court of Human Rights by murderers Jeremy Bamber, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore. Murder: Lee Rigby was mowed down in a car before being hacked to death in the street in front of horrified onlookers near Woolwich Barracks in south-east London in May last year . A Council of Europe spokesman said: ‘In Vinter and others v the UK, the ECHR did not say that whole-life sentences were incompatible with the convention, but there had to be the possibility of a review at some stage and current laws allowing for release in exceptional circumstances were unclear. ‘In (last week’s) judgment, the UK Court of Appeal has agreed with the ECHR that whole-life sentences are not incompatible with the convention, but disagreed that the existing laws allowing for release in exceptional circumstances are unclear and sought to clarify what the law is. ‘The Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers is now overseeing the implementation of the Vinter judgment, as is the usual procedure; the UK government submitted an action plan to the Committee on 9 January and said it would provide further information as soon as possible.’","ECHR had said whole-life tariffs with no right of review were unlawful .

Child benefit could be docked from almost 20,000 parents every year whose children truant, leaked Tory plans reveal. Penalties of £60 issued by schools to families whose children are persistently absent would be doubled and taken from welfare payments. Education Secretary Michael Gove is drawing up the scheme, which is designed to reinforce the legal responsibility of parents to ensure their children attend school from five to 16. Truant: Parents who allow their children to play truant may be hit with heavy fines and even lose their benefits if they continue to allow their children to stay away from school (file picture) The plan is expected to be included . in the Conservatives’ election manifesto next year, having been blocked . in coalition by the Liberal Democrats, although a final decision has not . yet been made. The . proposal is expected to garner strong support, with surveys showing 64 . per cent of voters in favour and only 25 per cent against. Among . Conservative voters, 80 per cent say they back the idea. The Department . for Education defines persistent absence as missing at least 15 per . cent of school. Some 41,224 . penalty notices for non-attendance at school were issued in the . academic year ending in summer 2012 – the latest for which figures are . available – of which just 22,043 were paid within the time limit of 28 . days. Under the plan . proposed by Mr Gove, the penalty for the remaining 19,181 families would . have been doubled to £120 and automatically docked from their child . benefit. Although . £1.3million a year is raised from truancy fines, ministers say there is a . problem with their enforcement. Around 82,000 fines – almost half the . total issued since 2004 – are unpaid. They lapse if they are not paid in 42 days, forcing local authorities to prosecute. But 60 per cent of those who fail to pay are never taken to court. Charlie Taylor, a head teacher who advised the Government on discipline, . said taking a parent to court was  ‘cumbersome and expensive’. Tough: Education Secretary Michael Gove is trying to persuade Tory colleagues to allow the fines imposed on parents of persistent truants to be taken from their child benefit . He . added: ‘During my review, when I met magistrates, schools and education . welfare officers, they frequently expressed frustration with a system . that takes up to six months to get a parent to court. One . magistrate explained how parents could exploit the system by pleading . not guilty, then failing to attend court when they were summoned and . finally not paying any fine imposed by the magistrate. ‘Parents who allow their child to miss too much school should receive a fine of £60. If . they fail to pay in 28 days, the fine should double to £120 and the . money should be recovered directly through child benefit. Persistent . failure to send children to school is a clear sign of neglect and that . children’s social care services should work with schools to address . underlying difficulties. ‘The . best schools work with parents to improve attendance. Fining parents or . taking them to court is a last resort. However, the system must be . effective.’ The plan is . thought to have broad support from most Tory Cabinet ministers, although . some involved in drawing up the manifesto are understood to have . insisted that vulnerable families were not unduly affected. It . is up to local authorities to set the criteria for issuing fines in . their area. It is also ultimately up to the head teacher to decide . whether to issue a fine. If a pupil has a medical condition that forces . them to miss lessons, the school can use its discretion.","Education Secretary wants to fine parents who allow children to play truant .

A Russian academic embroiled in an international tug-of-love dispute with his British-based former wife has gone into hiding, according to lawyers. Ilya Neustadt, 37, and children Daniel, seven, and Jonathan, five, are thought to be in Russia and have not been seen for several months, say solicitors representing the boys’ mother Rachael Neustadt. Lawyers said Ms Neustadt, 36, an American who lives in London, is ‘enormously concerned’ about the situation, which defies a court order. Rachael Neustadt (left) has been 'enormously concerned' after her former husband went into hiding with her two sons, Daniel (centre), seven, and Jonathan (right), five. She also has a third son, Meir, who is still with her . Ms Neustadt, a former teacher from Houston, Texas, had complained that Mr Neustadt was keeping Daniel and Jonathan in Russia in breach of orders made by a judge in England following a marriage break-up. She had asked Russian judges to intervene, using a piece of international law ratified by Russia last year. And her lawyers said that in November Ms Neustadt had won a ‘landmark’ court ruling in Russia, when the Moscow City Appeal Court recognised High Court orders made in England. But lawyers said today that Mr Neustadt, a former lecturer at London Metropolitan University, had defied that ruling and ‘forced’ the children into hiding. They said Mr Neustadt and the boys had not been since the autumn. ‘The father has defied the Russian courts and has forced the children into hiding. The father and the children have not been seen since last autumn,’ said a spokeswoman for London law firm Dawson Cornwell, which represents Ms Neustadt. ‘Neither the Russian court bailiff nor the Moscow police have taken any measures to find the children or to secure the children’s return to England, in accordance with the enforcement of the court orders.’ Ilya Neustadt, 37, has defied demands to return his two sons to England and is now in hiding in Russia, according to his former wife's lawyers . She added: ‘Rachael is enormously concerned for the children’s safety and well-being. Rachael is extremely anxious that the children are in danger. ‘The children have not attended school since mid-November 2013 and were last seen leaving their former residence accompanied by their paternal grandmother, Irina Mogilewski.’ Solicitor Caroline Korah, who works for Dawson Cornwell, said Russian court orders needed to be enforced. ‘It is extremely concerning that the children’s father is now in breach of the orders of the Russian courts, in addition to his breaches of the English courts,’ she said. ‘The Russian court’s decision to return the children to England, their country of habitual residence, needs to be enforced now. ‘We hope that the Russian legal system’s own enforcement procedures will conclude with the return of the children to England in the most summary and protective way for the children.’ Solicitors said the boys had been visiting their father in Russia for Christmas 2012 but he had refused to return them to their mother in London in January 2013. Ms Neustadt began legal action and a judge sitting in the High Court in London ordered Mr Neustadt to return the boys to England. Solicitors said he had not complied. Dawson Cornwell said an application had been made to Russian judges following Russia’s ratification of an international convention relating to cross-border disputes between parents.

"By . James Chapman And Becky Barrow . and Jason Groves . PUBLISHED: . 20:03 EST, 13 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 05:54 EST, 14 March 2014 . Downing Street was under mounting pressure last night to ease the 40p tax burden on the middle classes. The Chancellor is expected to reject calls for a significant increase to the threshold in next week’s Budget, after figures showed millions more are being sucked into the higher rate tax. The Government argues that it has cut taxes for all workers by repeatedly increasing the amount they can earn before paying any income tax at all, which will reach £10,000 next month. Reject: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is likely to refuse to listen to calls ahead of next week's Budget to ease the burden on middle-class taxpayers . But they are facing growing demands to help the 1.4million workers who have been sucked into the 40p band since 2010, with MPs arguing many of these people are on middling incomes. Official figures show that the top 25 per cent of earners – anyone on £33,717 or more – will pay 75 per cent of the country’s total £167billion of income tax this year. By contrast, the bottom half will pay less than 10 per cent. When the Coalition came to power in May 2010 the starting salary for higher rate tax stood at just £43,875. If George Osborne had allowed the 40p tax band to rise in line with inflation it would now not kick in until a worker reached a salary of £50,000, according to calculations by accountants Grant Thornton. But since 2010 Mr Osborne has repeatedly frozen or lowered this threshold – meaning hundreds of thousands have been dragged in. As a result, some 4.4million people now pay the 40p rate, up from just 3.02million when the Coalition came to power and 1.35million in 1988. Ministers insist that everyone earning up to £100,000 has benefited from the increases in the basic threshold – though admit that higher rate taxpayers have seen much less significant benefits. Downing Street last night warned Tory MPs agitating for a hike in the 40p threshold that they risk undermining the credit the party should be getting from voters for the new basic threshold. ‘If we as Tories go on and on about the higher rate versus the personal allowance, we’re obscuring a massive tax cut we have given every person who earns under £100,000,’ said one source. But Dominic Raab, the Conservative MP for Esher and Walton, said: ‘The 40p rate was designed to tax the rich, but now clobbers the middle classes. Yes, take the poor out of tax – but do it by cutting government spending, not at the expense of aspirational Britain.’ His views were echoed by Jonathan Todd, the chief economist at centre-left think tank Demos, who said: ‘People are being taxed too much on income but not enough on property. This is especially true in London, where a £41,000 salary doesn’t make you rich but does take you into the higher income tax bracket. The tax system should be updated to reflect how incomes have grown since 1988.’ David Cameron, speaking on a trip to Israel, insisted higher rate taxpayers earning up to £100,000 had also benefited from the increases in the basic-rate threshold. ‘What I am determined to do is to go on delivering tax cuts for low and middle income earners and from April this year there will be £10,000 you can earn before you start paying tax and that has been benefiting everybody earning up to £100,000,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘That’s a significant tax cut, a huge change. The point is people on the upper rate have benefited from the £10,000 tax-free income.’ Tory MP for Hereford Jesse Norman said: ‘The Chancellor’s made clear he believes the most effective way to support low and middle income earners is to enable them to keep more of the money they earn. ‘This is why he has increased the personal allowance. These increases are aimed at the less well-off, but higher-rate taxpayers have also benefited. Indeed, they are better off than if the higher rate threshold had increased with inflation.’ Official figures show that in 2013-14, the 25 per cent highest earners will pay 75 per cent of all income tax, while the top ten per cent, on £47,913 or more, will account for 59 per cent. The top 1 per cent will pay 28.3 per cent, or £47billion. The Treasury said that thanks to the £10,000 allowance, in 2013-14, higher rate taxpayers are about £45 better off than if tax thresholds had grown in line with inflation.","Middle-earners hit as tax has not kept pace with inflation .

A 'heartless' thief has been jailed after being caught red-handed stealing from her deaf 92-year-old neighbour thanks to the victim's son who installed motion-sensitive CCTV cameras inside the flat. Gillian Carlton King, 57, was filmed rifling through Hazel Bywater's belongings at her flat in Bridlington, East Yorks., before stealing a box containing £185 from her kitchen. Mrs Bywater's son Roy Porter and his partner Cherril decided to take action when they suspected money was being taken from the frail pensioner. Scroll down for video .

'Heartless': Gillian Carlton King heads off after being caught on camera stealing from her deaf 92-year-old neighbour . Two motion-sensitive cameras were installed in the flat two weeks before capturing Carlton King in the act and son Roy handed the footage over to the police. Roy, 67, said: 'She was directly in the camera line, but she knew exactly where she was going.' Victim: Hazel Bywater's son Roy Porter decided to act after his mother's £80 pension was stolen . Carlton King - who is a resident in the same block of flats - was charged with burglary. The former carer is currently serving nine months in prison after being sentenced at Hull Crown Court. Roy said when he heard the judge's verdict he was 'highly delighted' and described Carlton King as 'calculated' and 'heartless'. He explained how Carlton King would occasionally run errands for his mother and other residents at the block of flats. There had been a spate of thefts at the sheltered housing but it was when Hazel's £80 pension went missing that Roy and Cherril acted. Cherril, 63, said: 'We had to catch the thief.  Stealing is bad enough, but stealing from vulnerable people and the fact that she gained her trust it is a horrible thing to do.""Roy now visits his mother up to twice a day due to the stress she suffered during the ordeal. The locks were changed on Hazel's flat the day after the theft was filmed and she is now taking anti-depressants due to the stress. Cherril said: 'It is not the amount of money it is the anxiety that goes with it. She is not 100 per cent confident, she is a nervous person. 'We are a caring family and we do look after her and we do everything we can to make her comfortable and safe. 'But what about the other people that have no support, no family - how are they suffering? 'I'm just pleased that we were there and she has got a family that care about her and were able to catch the thief.' Mrs Bywater's son installed a motion sensitive CCTV camera inside his mother's house which caught the callous theif rifling through her property . The thief searches the living room of the pensioner's flat. She was later jailed for nine months . The two motion-sensitive cameras were installed in the flat two weeks before Carlton King was captured in the act . No shame: Carlton King would occasionally run errands for Mrs Bywater and other residents at the block of flats . Detective Inspector Joanne Roe, of the Serious Acquisitive Crime Team, said: 'This offender's actions have been despicable. She has preyed on residents at this sheltered accommodation, targeting the elderly and vulnerable. 'Her actions were cold and calculated towards the residents who have found the whole incident very distressing. 'I praise the family for their quick actions in having CCTV fitted to their mother's room, this has caught the offender in the act.'","Gillian Carlton King, 57, filmed rifling through Hazel Bywater's belongings .

A library has been forced to employ security guards to clamp down on visitors constantly watching porn on its public computers. Members of the public are regularly flocking to Boston Library, Lincolnshire, to take advantage of the free internet facilities. However, library users have reported seeing middle-aged men sitting at the desktop computers shamelessly gawping at x-rated videos. Crack down: Boston Library in Lincolnshire has employed security guards to stop visitors watching porn on its public computers . As a result, Lincolnshire County Council has now stepped up security in a bid to target visitors watching pornography in the library. A library source said people accessing explicit images is a 'regular issue' despite the computer's having filters to block adult content. 'We have part-time security guards who are taking on more hours solely to monitor the misuse of computers here,' said the source. 'We have children who use them so it really needs to be stopped.' Members of the library told today how they had caught users unashamedly watching explicit material at the site, which is based within the council's County Hall. Neville Jones, 71, said: 'I noticed one man quite openly viewing a pornographic video on one of the computers in full view of other library uses. 'I was rather alarmed and informed a member of staff straight away.' Caught in the act: Members of the library said they had seen users unashamedly watching explicit material at the site, which is based within the council's County Hall . Another library user, who did not wish to be named, said they witnessed a 'scruffy, middle-aged man' accessing pornographic images last week. 'He was looking at filth,' he said. 'He stunk of drink and was rough and trampy-looking. 'If the staff checked browser history from computer number 10 that day they'd have got an eyeful.' Earlier this month paedophile Robert Orton, 45, was jailed for two years after a library user spotted him looking at pictures of underage boys on the computers. Police raided his one-bedroomed flat in Boston and found more than 100,000 indecent images of children. Jonathan Platt, the council's head of libraries, said: 'We have software in place to help stop people downloading inappropriate material, which works on both English and foreign language sites. 'Anyone misusing our computers will be asked to leave the library, and repeat offenders will be banned. 'If we suspect illegal material has been downloaded, we will report the matter to the police. 'If a customer spots something that concerns them, they should tell a member of staff so they can take the necessary action. 'We continue to employ caretakers and security guards on a part-time basis.'","Users have reported seeing men watching x-rated videos in Boston Library .

A child sex abuse victim was arrested and locked up overnight in a police cell to make sure she gave evidence against her attacker. The vulnerable 15-year-old was detained for 20 hours to guarantee she testified against the 32-year-old man who had abused her. Judge Robert Bartfield gave  permission for the extraordinary decision, which has been condemned by child welfare groups as ‘Dickensian’. Jailed: Abid Miskeen has been sentenced to seven years in prison for impregnating a teenager . Yesterday the judge defended his . actions, insisting that the girl’s detention was essential for ‘the . interests of justice’ because ‘without her attendance, the trial would . have collapsed.’ The girl, . who lives in a children’s home and cannot be named for legal reasons, . was groomed for eight months by Abid Miskeen. She got pregnant aged 14 . in June last year and had an abortion. She . was reluctant to testify against Miskeen as she still ‘harboured strong . feelings’ for him. Despite this reticence, she arrived at Bradford . Crown Court at 10am on Wednesday last week to give evidence. Controversy: Judge Robert Barfield ordered the victim to be held in a police cell overnight . However, . she was kept waiting for more than five hours as the judge was busy with . another trial so, bored and frustrated, she left. Prosecutors . then applied to the judge to approve an arrest  warrant and she was . picked up by West Yorkshire Police, taken to  Halifax police station and . kept in a cell overnight. She . was brought back to court by police the next morning and kept in a . holding cell until the trial finally started at almost 4pm. When she finally gave evidence, it lasted just 22 minutes. Yesterday, . Miskeen was sentenced to seven years in prison for sexual activity with . a child. The father-of-two was also placed on the sex offenders’ register for life. A jury had taken less than two hours to return a . unanimous guilty verdict on Tuesday. On . jailing him, Judge Bartfield defended his decision and said: ‘Those who . decry the process that has taken place in this case should be careful . what they wish for.’ He added that had the girl not been present to give evidence, Miskeen would have walked free from court. However, victims’ charities have spoken out against the girl’s ‘utterly shameful’ treatment. Adam . Pemberton of Victim Support said: ‘It is utterly shameful that any . vulnerable witness, let alone a child who has been the victim of . sustained sexual exploitation, could be treated in such a grotesque and . degrading manner by those who were supposed to protect her. Hearing: The 15-year-old left Bradford Crown Court, pictured, while waiting to give evidence . The . spectacle of a child spending the hours before she gives evidence . against her abuser locked up in cells is nothing short  of Dickensian.’ Peter . Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, added: ‘This is a truly shocking . case. All elements of the justice system failed this girl. ‘She . was left waiting to give her evidence by the court and then the CPS and . police sought an unnecessarily harsh response to her leaving, and sadly . the judge granted this without considering what she had endured.’ Guidance . for judges and the Crown Prosecution Service warns that children should . not be kept waiting at courts, which can be ‘daunting and stressful for . children’. Furthermore, they must not be caused ‘unnecessary worry and . distress.’ Yesterday, Judge . Bartfield attempted to explain his decision, saying: ‘The suggestion . that she was in some way forced into the witness box by the prosecution . to give  evidence is wholly misconceived. ‘For better or worse that’s the way our system works.’ However, . Laura Hoyano, an associate professor of Law at the University of Oxford . and co-author of a book on child-abuse law and policy, described the . case as being ‘completely mishandled’. She added: ‘When it became clear there was going to be a long delay, they should have sent her home.’ A . spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said the ‘exceptional step’ to ask for a warrant was taken after ‘all other options were explored . and exhausted’ .","Teenager had an abortion after she was impregnated by Abid Miskeen, 32 .

The Liberal Democrats have been left all shook up after being beaten by the Elvis Party in a by-election. More voters backed a candidate calling for a 30 per cent discount in brothels for OAPs than Nick Clegg’s party in the election to Nottingham City Council. It is the latest embarrassment for the Lib Dems, who have also struggled in several Commons by-elections in recent months. The Bus-Pass Elvis Party beat the Lib Dems by 11 votes in the Nottingham City Council by-election . David Bishop from Bus-Pass Elvis Party managed to beat the Lib Dems into fifth place . Voters went to the polls yesterday to elect a new councillor in the Clifton North ward. Labour's Patricia Ferguson held the seat, where the other two councillors are Tories. Labour secured 1,179 votes, with the Conservative Andrew Rule taking 1,025. Ukip’s Kevin Clarke came third with 536 votes. In fourth place was David Bishop, from the Bus-Pass Elvis Party, who secured 67 votes, 11 more than Lib Dem Tony Marshall who managed just 56. David Bishop stood on a manifesto to legalise brothels, and give OAPs a 30 per cent discount . A Lib Dem spokesman said he was ‘all . shook up’ by the result. ‘I think this is a campaign where we were . accused of having Suspicious Minds,’ he added. ‘We have been left in .

Mr Bishop, who also calls himself Lord Biro, stood on a manifesto who promised to ‘legalise brothels with a 30% reduction for OAPs’. He also called for an inquiry in British Vet Fees, a ban on air guns and a campaign to ‘save public lavatories from extinction’. It added: ‘Nigel Farage recently said he would like to see a relaxation of the rules on Hand Gun ownership. ‘Our candidate hopes he and his party never come into power as Nottingham will be worse than Dodge City. ‘If they do come into power our candidate will write to Clint Eastwood and ask him to be the Deputy Sheriff of Nottingham.’ Mr Bishop has previously stood against disgraced Tory MP Neil Hamilton, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Ukip’s Robert Kilroy Silk.

Billionaire financier George Soros has warned that foreign-owned companies would flee Britain if the country decided to quit the European Union. The notorious currency speculator - whose actions devastated sterling in 1992 - said that Britain had the best of all worlds by being part of the EU but not the euro. But underlining corporate concerns about the economic impact of a British exit, he suggested yesterday that an exit would cost jobs and investment. George Soros speaking in London yesterday: The billionaire investor warned that multinational companies would flee Britain, shedding jobs, if the country were to leave the European Union . 'I leave it to the British business community, particularly multinationals that set up factories here as an entry point into the common market, to explain to the public what they stand to lose,' he said. 'But in one word - jobs.' Mr Soros's comments came as Labour leader Ed Miliband said his party would be unlikely to table an in/out referendum on Europe if it was to win the next election. David Cameron, the prime minister, is all but committed to such a poll in 2017 after pressure from the Tories' eurosceptic right, who fear an electoral challenge from Ukip, who are avowedly anti-EU. Mr Soros, who spoke yesterday in London to promote his latest book, warned that Europe's union might yet collapse if its economy continues to stagnate, a situation he blamed on Germany. 'The policy of austerity that Germany imposed on the eurozone countries was the wrong one,' he added in a comment piece published this morning in the Financial Times. 'The downward pressure has now diminished and this has given financial markets a lift. But the prospect of a long period of stagnation has not been removed and it has set in motion a negative political dynamic. 'Anybody who finds the prevailing arrangements are intolerable is pushed into an anti-European posture, so I expect the process of disintegration to gather momentum.' Differing positions: Labour leader Ed Miliband, left, says his party has no intention to hold an in/out referendum on EU membership, but Tory Prime Minister David Cameron, right, has vowed to hold such a poll in 2017 . Mr Soros, 83, famously made $1billion by betting against the sterling on Black Wednesday in 1992, forcing John Major's Tory government to withdraw from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. But now, he said, any British withdrawal from European institutions would hasten the collapse of the EU and diminish the Union's standing in world affairs. He predicted disaster if any country were to try to leave the eurozone currency bloc. 'If the euro disintegrated in a disorderly manner it would not have solved the problem, it would have created an even bigger problem – a real meltdown,' he was quoted as saying yesterday by The Guardian. 'The problems of the euro don't have a national solution. Leaving the euro is a disaster. It would mean defaulting on a country's debts. That would have very severe consequences for financial stability. 'It might be beyond the powers of the authorities to control.' Despite that dire warning, Mr Soros suggested that if Scotland votes for independence, it would be better off joining the eurozone that pursuing monetary union with the Bank of England. ‘Scotland wants to remain part of the pound sterling and Britain is creating obstructions to that,' he said. 'It would be a very difficult relationship and I don’t think that Scotland becoming independent and yet remaining part of the sterling is possible.’","Comments came as Labour leader rejects referendum if his party wins .

The chairman of the BBC Trust has been forced into a humiliating climbdown over his repeated refusal to appear before a committee of MPs. Lord Patten has spent months trying to avoid a grilling by members of the Commons European Scrutiny Committee over claims of bias in the BBC’s coverage of the EU. But yesterday, Bill Cash, chairman of the committee that reviews UK-EU relations, announced that Lord Patten had given in. Chairman of the BBC Trust Lord Patten will face Commons European Scrutiny Committee over claims of bias in the BBC's coverage of the EU . The peer, a former European Commissioner, had three times refused the request, claiming it would be ‘inappropriate’ because it might interfere with the BBC’s ‘editorial independence’. With European elections two months away and questions about the BBC’s perceived pro-EU bias high on the agenda, it is thought the session could take place within weeks. Mr Cash said: ‘Chris Patten has accepted that he must take up our invitation. He went to considerable lengths to avoid appearing, which was quite extraordinary. We will not be treated in this manner.’ Bill Cash, chairman of the committee, announced Lord Patten will face MPs . Lord Patten is paid £110,000-a-year to work part-time at the BBC Trust. His duties require him to represent the interests of licence fee payers. He sparked fury last year by turning down three requests to give evidence to the committee. This led to suggestions that he was cynically exploiting a loophole that allows members of the Lords to veto appearances before Commons Select Committees. Another committee member, Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins, said: ‘The reason Chris Patten was able to refuse us was because he is a member of the Lords. 'Peers can’t be commanded to appear in front of MPs. Had he just been Mr Patten we could have commanded him to appear but he felt as he was in the Lords he was able to refuse.’ It is understood Lord Patten’s stonewalling raised concerns among the chairmen of other Select Committees and is likely to lead to a change in parliamentary rules. The BBC Trust said: ‘The Chairman made clear that while he was willing to appear before the Committee, the BBC’s constitutional independence under its Charter must be protected and he will not be in a position to discuss BBC editorial decisions.’","Lord Patten will be grilled over claims of bias in the BBC's coverage of EU .

A storm that brought some of the highest rainfall totals to the Los Angeles area in years has continued to hammer much of California through Saturday afternoon. Up to eight inches poured down in some mountain ranges and the tumultuous pressure systems led to a tornado warning early Saturday morning. In Azusa and neighboring foothill communities about 25 miles east of Los Angeles that sit beneath nearly 2,000 acres of steep mountain slopes that just weeks ago were menaced by a wildfire, about 1,200 homes were under evacuation orders Friday over mudflow fears but were so-far spared. Widespread: The storm hit much of California with areas around Los Angeles the worst hit including Glendora (pictured on Saturday) Danger on the roads: Drivers had to take caution in Van Nuys on Friday, which marked the second day of floods . Out of nature: Lake Hughes  started disseminating rivers of mud debris on Friday . In particular danger were about a dozen homes in Azusa that were backed up against a steep fire-denuded hillside several hundred feet high that authorities feared could collapse. Muddy water swept down the hillside earlier in the day, spreading about two feet of ooze above one backyard, although fencing walls and an orchard of about 5,000 avocado trees behind the development stopped most serious debris. Despite the urging of police and fire officials who cleared reporters and others out of the neighborhood as the hill grew more saturated, at least a few residents decided to stay on. One such reporter was Miguel Almaguer of NBC Nightly News who waded into the thigh-deep mud for a live shot that aired Friday night and promptly had to be pulled out by emergency responders when he was unable to get out. Dennis Sanderson, 50, said his reaction to the evacuation order was ‘we'll ride it out,’ but by nightfall he was undecided and keeping an eye on the weather because of forecasts for more rainfall. Making in effort: Bob Lavezzari clears ashen mud from in front of his home in Azusa where many residents have been told to evacuate . Rain-made rivers: Highways and busy roads in Studio City, California were flooded with water (pictured Friday) About 13 homes were evacuated Friday night in Palmdale in northern Los Angeles County, where a mudslide closed a major road. Thunder echoed and hard rain fell late Friday night on Hollywood, which was abuzz with preparations for Sunday evening's Academy Awards and hopes the rain will have moved on by then as expected. Raincoat: An Oscar statue is covered with plastic as preparations for the 86th Academy Awards continues in the rain outside the Dolby Theatre on Saturday . Rainfall totals in parts of California were impressive, especially in areas that typically don't receive much, but not nearly enough to offer long-term relief from a long-running drought. Three inches fell on Bel Air and Pasadena, and an urban flash-flood warning that was sent to cell phones was called late Friday night for central Los Angeles County. For the first time in nearly three years, downtown Los Angeles received more than 2 inches - doubling its total for the rainy season that began in July, the National Weather Service said. Yet the city remained 7 inches below the normal 11 inches. Meanwhile to the east in San Bernardino County, a levee failed and put eight houses in danger of serious flooding, but county fire crews were working to protect them and no evacuations were ordered. Forecasters expected the storm to last . through Saturday in California before trundling east into similarly . rain-starved neighboring states. Phoenix was expecting its first . noticeable precipitation in two months. The storm was projected to head . east across the Rockies before petering out in the Northeast in several . days. Rain also fell along the central coast, the San Francisco Bay area and Central Valley. Winter . storm warnings were in effect in the Sierra Nevada. About 15 inches of . new snow had fallen by mid-day Friday at the University of California, . Berkeley's Central Sierra Snow Lab located at 6,900 feet elevation. Hectic: Workers swept the carpet on Friday to get rid of the inches of water that has accumulated from the storm . A tornado warning was issued for Sacramento, Yolo and Sutter counties Friday night but was canceled soon after. Forecasters seemed somewhat happy at the beginning of the rainfall because it looked like it could be a way for the region to get out of an ongoing drought, but really  said such systems would have to become common for the state to make serious inroads against the drought. ‘We need several large storms and we just don't see that on the horizon,’ National Weather Service meteorologist Eric Boldt said Friday. ‘This is a rogue storm. We will dry out next week.’ Big night out: The elaborate dresses of Hollywood stars will be sheltered from the rain by a clear plastic roof over the red carpet . Downpour: A worker keeps rainwater from pooling on a temporary roof over the red carpet as preparations for the 86th Academy Awards continues in the rain outside the Dolby Theatre . Farmer Ray Gene Veldhuis, who grows almonds, walnuts and pistachios and runs a 2,300-cow dairy in the Central Valley's Merced County, welcomed the wet weather but knew it would not rescue California from drought. ‘Hopefully, they keep coming,’ Veldhuis said of the storms. ‘If not, we'll deal with the hand we're dealt.’ Numerous traffic accidents occurred on slick or flooded roads across California, including one about 60 miles east of Los Angeles involving a big rig whose driver died after falling from a freeway overpass. Power outages hit about 32,000 customers, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Southern California Edison said. Dangerous mess: Mud and unstopping rain dragged trash along the shore in Long Beach, California on Saturday .

Depositions in the sexual assault case of a Missouri teenager who claimed she was raped by a school friend show contradictions in statements between the girl and her mother. The special prosecutor in the case released depositions on Friday of Daisy Coleman and her mother, Melinda, taken in July 2012. In more than 100 pages of testimony, the Colemans described the night in January 2012 when Daisy, who was 14 at the time, claims she was raped. Ordeal: Daisy Coleman claims she was raped by a high school student when she was 14 . Contradictions: Newly released documents appear to suggest Melinda Coleman and her daughter gave differing statements to police . Jackson County prosecuting attorney Jean Peters Baker served as special prosecutor after Nodaway County Prosecutor Robert Rice asked for someone else to review the evidence amid questions about why he dropped charges against the alleged attacker. Accused: Matt Barnett was named by Daisy as her attacker. Charges were dropped . The testimony describes how Daisy and a female friend had been drinking before asking Matt Barnett, then 17, to pick them up after they sneaked out of Daisy's home. Daisy claimed Barnett took her to his house, plied her with alcohol and raped her when she blacked out. Mrs Coleman found her daughter shivering on the front porch at about 5am the next day. According to the depositions released on Friday, Mrs Coleman told Rice that Daisy had been less than truthful on some things in her deposition and attributed that to the girl's embarrassment over the ordeal. For example, Rice at one point had asked Daisy about an incident in which she burned the name of a boy into her skin. Mrs Coleman said that it was Barnett's name; Daisy said in her deposition that it was another boy's name. At one point, the mother suggested that the contradictions would likely keep the case out of a courtroom. 'I don't think that you probably can try this case now. I think there's been too many lies,' she said, according to the newly released documents. The Colemans and their supporters later claimed Rice dropped a felony assault charge against Barnett because of insensitivity, prosecutorial ambivalence and political pressure from the boy's grandfather, a retired state trooper and four-term state legislator. Mrs Coleman told The Associated Press on Friday that she hadn't seen the depositions, which she claimed Rice had denied even existed, and she didn't believe some of what was purported to be in them. Claims: Daisy alleged that Barnett took her to his house and gave her alcohol before assaulting her . 'Quite frankly, Robert Rice is a liar and I wouldn't be surprised if he put that in there himself,' Mrs Coleman said. Daisy's story made headlines nationwide after The Kansas City Star published a 4,000-word article in October detailing the girl's claims against Barnett. The AP generally doesn't name the victims of sexual assault but it is naming Daisy because she and her mother granted public interviews. In January, Barnett pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment after Baker concluded there wasn't enough evidence for a felony conviction. Barnett has not denied the two had sex, but has insisted that it was consensual. Robert Sundell, an attorney who initially represented Barnett after he was charged, said on Friday he was glad the documents were released. 'If all of the records and all of the evidence were made public, I think it would be pretty easy for anyone to recognize why the case didn't go forward,' he said.","100 pages of depositions are released, detailing mother and daughter's statements about high-profile case .

Children in state primary and secondary schools could be trained in meditation to help them cope with stress. Ministers are considering  introducing lessons in ‘mindfulness’ – a growing movement  based on ancient Eastern traditions of meditation. Schools Minister David Laws  said evidence suggested the sessions could help boost pupils’ attitudes  and motivation. Teaching children how to meditate and breathing techniques can help them cope with stress and pay attention, it is claimed . He said the Government was ‘very interested’ in promoting mindfulness, which teaches participants to relate directly to whatever is happening ‘in the moment’. The revelation follows calls from a leading public school headmaster for schools to set aside time for quiet reflection every day. Anthony Seldon said a ‘daily stillness period’ would help improve children’s concentration and reduce levels of anxiety and depression. He has championed the practice at his school, Wellington College, in Berkshire. Now ministers have disclosed  they believe mindfulness techniques ‘certainly merit consideration’ and education minister Liz Truss has  been actively looking into the practice, it emerged. Giving evidence at the Commons education select committee yesterday, Liberal Democrat Mr Laws was asked whether the Department  for Education planned to promote mindfulness courses to boost children’s wellbeing. In reply, he said: ‘We are very . interested in promoting this and we certainly think that it’s an area . that merits consideration based on the evidence we’ve seen to date. My . colleague Liz Truss actually has been looking at this recently.’ Asked . to explain the concept of mindfulness, he said: ‘It’s about trying to . impact on people’s motivations, their attitudes to life. It’s about . trying to get at some of the things we don’t always get at through our . crude technical interventions. Education Minister David Laws said said he thought in 'mindfulness' should be taken seriously in helping to improve pupils' 'attitudes to life' ‘It’s an area that we should take seriously while making sure that there is proper evidence-based scrutiny of it.’ Rooted in ancient Buddhist practices, the modern mindfulness movement has been gathering momentum over the last 30 years. Advocating the practice, Dr Seldon said the decline of religious assemblies had reduced opportunities for pupils to ‘reflect during the school day’, just as large numbers of children faced unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety. Pupils’ concentration had also been eroded by the ‘incessant chatter’ of modern life, he said, with children spending a large amount of time on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Wellington College has a mindfulness programme that involves two-minute ‘stillness’ periods each day. Pupils aged between 13 and 15 have a further 15-minute session each week. Dr Seldon added:  ‘Mindfulness or meditation has been shown to be an invaluable tool to help bolster  young people’s resilience to psychological stress. It also boosts concentration, depth of thought, happiness and achievement. ‘It is the most simple and natural technique to learn … It is all about being yourself, making the most of yourself, and making the most of the opportunities that life presents to you. It promotes trusting relationships, healthy living and psychological and emotional security.’ He said schools had a duty to give pupils time to think, free of daily work, mobile telephones and the internet. Dr Seldon has previously pioneered wellbeing lessons, because he had seen during his time as a teacher ‘far too many tortured and unhappy pupils who have achieved four or five A grades at A-level’. Schools should teach such life  skills, he added, ‘while individuals are still having their characters and habits formed’. Inspired by ancient Buddhist meditation, mindfulness courses were developed in the late 1970s by US doctors to combat stress. The therapies aim to help people live more ‘in the moment’ and spend less time going over past stresses and worrying about future problems. Techniques include moving  the focus of attention around  the body and observing sensations that arise – the so-called ‘body scan’. Others involve concentrating on breathing or completing yoga-style movements and observing sensations in moments of movement and stillness. Mindfulness is said to help people recognise and overcome negative thoughts while noticing small pleasures around them. Although some regard it with scepticism, studies appear to show a clinical benefit for treating a range of mental health problems. Thousands of mindfulness sessions are prescribed to NHS patients every year to help treat anxiety and depression. Celebrity adherents of the now secular practice include Hollywood actresses Goldie Hawn and Meg Ryan.","Schools minister David Laws says Buddhist technique could help children .

An unemployed woman made no effort to find a job because she was waiting for the inheritance from her mother’s will, a judge was told. Benefits dependent Christine Watts, 47, became unemployed in 2005, but expected to be rescued by a share of her mother’s £200,000 estate, the High Court heard. However, Miss Watts was left with nothing after her mother, Valerie, changed her will on her deathbed, leaving everything to son Gary. Christine Watts (left), who has been claiming benefits for years, has launched a legal battle to get the £200,000 inheritance she thought would afford her the 'easy life' after her mother died, a court has heard . She is now challenging the validity of the will, arguing that it must have been forged or was not properly executed. Miss Watts and her brother are fighting  over their mother’s home in Dartford, Kent, and the savings that she left Gary, 44, when she died aged 71 after signing her will in  hospital in January 2011 during her final illness. Gary says he deserves every penny of his inheritance for the years he spent caring for his mother, but his sister is fighting to convince Judge Catherine Newman QC that she is due a share. ‘I need money for living expenses,’ she told the judge. The court heard Miss Watts, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, was adopted by Valerie and her then husband Leonard in 1967 from a children’s home when she was just ten months old. Her brother was taken in three years later when less than a year old. Her counsel, Jordan Holland, told the court she has back problems and psychological issues which make it impossible for her to work. He argued that made her ‘dependent’ on her late mother, despite being an adult. But Neil McLarnon, for Gary Watts, accused her of making no effort to find work while she waited for her mother to die. Christine Watts, 47, has 'done nothing to get a job' since she became unemployed in 2005, because she expected to be rescued by a share of her mother's estate, the High Court heard . However Miss Watts, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, was left without a penny when her mother, Valerie, changed her will on her deathbed. Instead left her house (pictured) in Dartford, Kent, and all her savings to her son Gary, 44 . The barrister said: ‘You are trying . to give the impression that you have severe medical problems in the hope . of securing some sort of compensation from your mother’s estate.’ Miss . Watts, who used to work as an underwriter, replied: ‘I feel that, if I . take a job, I would not be able to commit to it because of taking time . off sick and it wouldn’t be fair.’ She added that she has debts that she . considers large, but denied that she had been waiting for her mother’s . death to save her from financial dire straits. Explaining why Mrs Watts . had cut her daughter out of her will, Gary said: ‘She was disappointed . with her not showing any concern for her, not coming up and visiting . her.’ He said his mother first talked of cutting her out of the will in 2006, but he persuaded her not to. He . added: ‘I didn’t dissuade her in 2011 because it was mum’s last wish, . that she wanted to make known, and I would not go against mum’s last . wish.’ Judge Newman has reserved  her decision on the case until a later date.","Christine Watts, 47, 'done nothing to get a job' since 2005, court heard .

Jailed: Alan Watts, 65, of Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, was found guilty in Luton of manslaughter . A 65-year-old man who attacked a former cancer patient ‘in a moment of madness’ in an argument over a disabled parking space was jailed for five years today. Alan Watts, of Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, was found guilty of the manslaughter of 64-year-old Brian Holmes, following a confrontation in a supermarket car park. Mr Holmes, from Sandy in Bedfordshire, died at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge the day after the incident in the car park of the Biggleswade branch of Asda. Just days before the incident on August 3, he had been told he had beaten cancer. Watts pleaded not guilty to manslaughter, claiming self-defence. A Luton Crown Court official said that a jury had convicted him and he had been sentenced by Judge Michael Kay QC. Prosecutor Ann Evans said during her opening address that Watts goaded Mr Holmes after seeing his car was parked in a disabled space before setting on him in an unprovoked attack. Mr Holmes had returned to the car without his wife Christine, who suffered rheumatoid arthritis, when Watts sarcastically shouted: ‘You look like you need a wheelchair.’ Ms Evans said: ‘This is a case about how a moment of madness can change people's lives forever. The defendant, Alan Watts, in a show of extraordinary violence, lashed out at Brian Holmes at a car park in Asda and killed him with a punch to the head.’ Ms Evans said CCTV footage, which she played to the four women and eight men in the jury, showed Watts punch Mr Holmes twice in a ‘right-left combination’ before the victim dropped to the ground. Watts then got back in his vehicle and drove away, she said. Mrs Holmes struggled to compose . herself from the public gallery as the footage was being played while . Watts, who was wearing large headphones to help him hear the . proceedings, sat motionless. Emotion: Christine Holmes (seen with the late Mr Holmes) struggled to compose herself from the public gallery . Death: The court heard that just days before the incident, Mr Holmes (left) was told he had beaten cancer . Ms . Evans said Watts told police he was acting in self-defence because Mr . Holmes had tried to pull him out of his car and had grabbed his wrists. The prosecutor said Watts claimed Mr Holmes was ‘effing and blinding’ and suspected he was drunk. Watts . told police he left the scene immediately because he wanted to get his . wife home and ‘didn't know whether he was going to be attacked again’, . Ms Evans said. But the . prosecutor said it would be up to the jury to decide whether it was . reasonable to believe Mr Holmes was the aggressor, particularly given he . had recently received positive medical news. ‘Here is Mr Holmes, a man who was recently given the all clear from cancer,’ she said. ‘Does he, as Mr Watts suggest, lose it?’ Mrs Holmes sobbed as Ms Evans read her witness statement to the court. Location: The men had a confrontation in an Asda supermarket car park (pictured) on August 3 . It . said she expected her husband to return to Asda to go shopping with her . after putting some shorts he had purchased in the car, but he never . returned. ‘I continued shopping then went to the self-checkout,’ she said. ‘During this time I was constantly looking out for Brian, expecting to see him at any moment.’ 'This is a case about how a moment of madness can change people's lives forever' Ann Evans, prosecuting . But she left the supermarket and saw her husband's legs sticking out from behind a screen that had been set up by paramedics. Emergency crews put her in the back of the police car and made sure her son was with her, telling her she was in shock. ‘I thought 'this must be bad',’ she said. Nurse . Patricia Pearson told the court she saw the entire incident unfold, . from when the argument began to when Watts allegedly punched Mr Holmes . twice in the face. She said Watts looked aggressive and her ‘instinct’ told her something bad would happen. Both . she and fellow witness Chris McKenna denied suggestions from Watts' barrister Derek Johashen that Mr Holmes was the aggressor. Couple: Mr Holmes (right) had returned to the car without his wife Christine (left), who suffered rheumatoid arthritis, when Watts sarcastically shouted: 'You look like you need a wheelchair' Sadness: Mrs Holmes (pictured with Mr Holmes) sobbed as the prosecutor read her witness statement to the court . The court heard that Watts had a previous . conviction for assault, dating from 1976 when he was aged 28. He had . assaulted a neighbour. Mr Holmes's family issued a statement after the case, saying he was a kind, caring, loving man with no enemies and many friends. They said: ‘We are pleased that the trial is now over, that justice has been done. Mugshot: Watts, of Biggleswade, pleaded not guilty to manslaughter, claiming self-defence . ‘Brian was deprived of his life and our family has been deprived of a loving husband, father, stepfather and granddad. Many more people have been deprived of a good and loyal friend. ‘Brian was, in every sense of the word, a gentleman. A kind, caring, loving man with no enemies and many friends. A man for whom caring was second nature and his wife and family his first priority. ‘We would, as a family, like to thank the investigation team, the prosecutors and the court for the kind and sensitive way they have dealt with Brian's death and we would now ask that we are left in peace to begin to rebuild our lives.’ Detective Inspector Liz Mead said: ‘This is a sharp and timely reminder for people to think before they act. Watts' actions mean he will now lose his liberty and be separated from his family. ‘But our thoughts are focused on Brian's family, who have remained dignified throughout this harrowing process of putting the life of a very private man into the public arena through no fault of his own. ‘They, as a family, should be celebrating a Christmas and looking forward to 2014 without the shackles of cancer, but instead they have an empty place which cannot be filled by the tragic and unnecessary death of Brian, a loving husband, best friend, carer, father, grandfather and a gentleman. ‘Alan Watts was aware of his actions and the evidence against him at an early stage of this investigation but took up his right to trial, drawing out the court process and forcing Brian's family to publicly hear how their loved one was killed. I am, therefore, pleased with the jury's verdict today.’","Alan Watts, 65, found guilty of manslaughter of Brian Holmes .

A notorious child killer who raped and murdered a seven-year-old and was suspected to have strangled two other girls has died in prison at the age of 84. Raymond Morris was dubbed the 'Monster of Cannock Chase' after he snatched Christine Darby off the street in 1967 and killed her before dumping her on a patch of countryside in Staffordshire. He was also the prime suspect in the murders of five-year-old Diane Tift and Margaret Reynolds, six, who disappeared in 1965 and were later found dead near where Christine's body was discovered. The killings shocked the country and sparked one of the biggest murder investigations in history - even bigger than the hunt for the Moors murderers - leading to Morris being jailed in 1969. Killer: Raymond Morris, left, assaulted and murdered seven-year-old Christine Darby, right . Victims: Morris is also suspected of the murders of Margaret Reynolds, left, and Diane Tift, right . Today the Ministry of Justice announced that Morris had died of natural causes at HMP Preston, after 45 years in prison. The Independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has launched an investigation into Morris' death, as is required by law. Jean Buttery, the sister of Diane Tift, described the killer - believed to have snatched Diane as she was walking to her grandmother's house - as 'evil'. 'I'm glad he is dead but it will never bring my sister back,' she said today. 'It does bring some closure but you never forget. I think he was low-life scum. He was evil. Pure evil.' Dead: Morris has died at HMP Preston from natural causes at the age of 84 . Investigation: Morris covered by a coat as he was escorted by police following his arrest in 1968 . The Cannock Chase murders appalled the countries after Diane and Margaret's bodies were found buried in a ditch in the beauty spot next to the A34. Diane had gone missing from her home in Bloxwich two weeks earlier, while Margaret Reynolds disappeared while walking to school in Aston the previous September. Police said the girls had been sexually abused before being strangled and having their bodies dumped in the countryside. A year later, the body of Christine Darby was discovered by a soldier on Cannock Chase - just a mile from the first grim discovery. She had also been taken from the street near her home before being strangled and raped. The hunt for the Cannock Chase killer saw 150 detectives visit 39,000 homes, interview 80,000 people and check more than a million car records, as well as issuing the first ever 'e-fit' composite picture of the suspect. Sensation: The news of Christine's death as it was reported on the front page of the Daily Mail in 1967 . Conviction: Morris' alibi fell apart after his wife Carol revoked her statement that they had been shopping . Morris was interviewed after another attempted abduction, when 10-year-old Margaret Aulton managed to escape from a man who tried to force her into his car. He was spoken to four times but slipped through the net when his wife Carol gave him an alibi - however, she later changed her story and became a key prosecution witness. Morris was found guilty of raping and murdering Christine and sentenced to life in prison, but he was never chaged with the death of Diane and Margaret. In 2011, Morris broke his silence insisting he was an innocent man. He said: 'No acquisitions of guilt can ever compensate the loss that the families involved must feel. 'But I will always maintain that I am not responsible for the murder of Christine Darby and hopefully my fight for justice will uncover the truth. 'I can only say over and over again, I didn't do it, and hope that someone will listen.' He was granted a judicial review in a bid to prove his innocence, but the review was later rejected. September 8, 1965: Six-year-old Margaret Reynolds goes missing on her way to school in Aston, Birmingham. December 30: Five-year-old Diane Tift goes missing on her way to her grandmother's house in Bloxwich, West Midlands. January 12, 1966: The bodies of Margaret Reynolds and Diane Tift are found at Cannock Chase. August 14: 10-year-old Jane Taylor disappears near Cannock Chase and is never seen again. August 19, 1967: Seven-year-old Christine Darby is lured into a car by a man near with a local accent. August 22: Christine's body is found on Cannock Chase. November 4, 1968: A failed attempt to abduct 10-year-old Margaret Aulton is witnessed and police are called. They arrest Raymond Morris, but his wife gives him an alibi for the day Christine was murdered. November 15: Carol Morris is shown pornographic pictures that her husband took of her five-year-old niece and retracts her statement. November 16: Morris is charged with the murder of Christine Darby and is remanded in custody. February 18, 1969: A seven-day trial ends with Morris found guilty of murder. He is sentenced to life imprisonment. August 2010: Morris begins an appeal. November: Morris is granted a judicial review in the case of the murder of Christine Darby. The review is overturned. May 2011: Morris breaks a 40-year silence, claims his innocence and says he may go to the European Court of Human Rights. March 11, 2014: Morris confirmed dead at 8pm at health facility in HMP Preston.","Morris snatched Christine Darby off the street in 1967 before sexually assaulting and killing her then dumping body on Cannock Chase .

More than £65billion was spent in Scotland in 2012-13 by Westminster and Holyrood but only £53billion was raised through taxes . Scotland plunged more than £12billion into the red last year following a catastrophic collapse in oil revenues that leaves Alex Salmond’s independence plans in chaos. Over £65billion was spent north of the Border in 2012-13 by Westminster and Holyrood, but just £53billion was raised through taxes. The growing ‘black hole’ has destroyed Nationalist claims that Scotland pays more towards the UK than it receives back, and exposes the dangers of building an economy on such a volatile resource as oil. The amount of tax generated by Scotland’s North Sea fields plummeted from £10billion in 2011-12 to just £5.6billion – a 41.5 per cent fall – in the wake of unplanned stoppages. Economic experts last night warned that oil revenues are ‘likely to have fallen again’ this year. At the same time, the cost of Scotland’s massive welfare state continues to grow – increasing by nearly £1.3billion to an eye-watering £22.4billion. As a result, the country’s deficit has risen from 5.8 per cent to 8.3 per cent, compared to a fall from 7.6 per cent to 7.3 per cent across the UK as a whole. The official figures – unveiled by First Minister Mr Salmond yesterday morning – mean that every man, woman and child would have been the equivalent of £283 worse off in 2012-13 if Scotland was independent. And according to the Treasury, the figure could actually be as high as £500. However, in an example of the strength of remaining in the Union, that overspend was effectively paid for by taxpayers across the UK. In a major miscalculation by separatist campaign chiefs, the findings came as they launched an advertising campaign asking Scots: ‘What would you say to living in one of the world’s wealthiest nations?’ The official Yes Scotland website was quietly altered yesterday after the figures destroyed claims that Scotland pays more in tax than it receives in spending. Mr Salmond yesterday insisted that Scotland’s public finances have been healthier than the UK’s ‘over the past five years’. But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: ‘Whatever the Scottish Government says now, the government of an independent Scotland would be forced to raise taxes and cut public services.’ Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander warned an independent Scotland would have to cut spending and put up taxes . She was the poster girl for Team GB at London 2012. Now Olympic gold medallist Jessica Ennis-Hill has joined the independence debate by saying she would prefer that the team stayed together. The pregnant heptathlete and Glasgow 2014 ambassador visited the Hampden Park Commonwealth Stadium and Athletes Village yesterday. She was joined by Team Scotland star and Commonwealth silver medallist Eilidh Child, with whom she shared a room at London 2012. When asked how she would feel about losing some of her team mates if Scotland votes Yes, Ennis-Hill said: 'I definitely think one team is a great way to go forward. 'Even though at this Commonwealth Games Eilidh will be competing for Scotland and some of my other team mates will be competing for England, we still very much feel like one team. 'In sport, I would definitely like to stay as one team.' Former Chancellor Alistair Darling, . who is leading the pro-Union Better Together campaign, said: ‘This is a . landmark moment in the debate. This is the day that Alex Salmond’s own . figures made the case against independence. ‘If . Scotland was independent today we would have no option but to cut . spending on services like schools and hospitals or put up taxes – or . probably both. Today as part of the UK we don’t have to do that. ‘Oil . revenues are a major source of Scotland’s income, but are a relatively . small part of the UK economy. The drop in oil revenue is so big that it . is the equivalent of the entire budget for Scottish schools.’ Scottish . LibDem leader Willie Rennie added: ‘If this was the first day of . independence, Scotland’s chancellor of the exchequer would be announcing . an emergency budget to increase taxes or cut spending on schools, . hospitals and universities.’ The figures are contained in the annual ‘government expenditure and revenue Scotland’ (GERS) accounts, released by the country’s chief statistician. Including a geographical share of North Sea oil, Scotland’s deficit was £12.1billion in 2012-13, compared to £8.6billion in 2011-12. That is the equivalent of 8.3 per cent of GDP, while the UK’s £114.8billion deficit was equivalent to 7.3 per cent. That 1 percentage point difference is equivalent to £1.5billion, or £283 per head. However, Treasury chiefs yesterday used a different calculation as they pointed out that Scotland’s GDP-per-head is higher than the UK. Due to North Sea oil, the amount of tax raised north of the Border was £800-per-head higher than the UK as a whole, but spending-per-head was around £1,300 higher – leaving a shortfall of £500 for every man, woman and child. John McLaren, a leading economist at Glasgow University’s Centre for Public Policy for Regions (CPPR), said: ‘Measuring Scotland’s fiscal position relative to the UK depends heavily on North Sea oil revenues. Recent years have, on average, shown the fiscal balance relative to the UK to be marginally in Scotland’s favour but, in 2012-13 the reverse is now true. This is likely to remain the case in 2013-14, as North Sea revenues are projected to fall again.’ David Phillips of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), added: ‘In planning for independence, the Scottish Government should be cautious in its fiscal assessment, and avoid building its budget on the back of optimistic forecasts for North Sea revenues.’ But Mr Salmond said: ‘Scotland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world. ‘The figures show that tax revenues generated in 2012-13 were £800 higher per head in Scotland compared with the UK, meaning that now for every one of the last 33 years, tax receipts have been higher in Scotland than the UK. ‘Over the past five years, Scotland’s public finances have been relatively healthier than the UK’s by a total of £8.3billion - the equivalent of nearly £1,600 per person.’ He said the ‘net fiscal deficit’ in Scotland in 2012-13 reflected the ‘higher level of capital spending in Scotland which will boost the economy in the long term’. He added: ‘North Sea revenues fell by 41.5 per cent between 2011-12 and 2012-13. This - in part - was caused by unplanned disruption to production and record capital investment by the oil and gas industry which has doubled since 2010. This will reduce tax receipts in the short-term but maximise tax revenues in the future.’","State spent £65billion in Scotland in 2012-13 but tax raised only £53billion .

A dominatrix who whipped cross-dressing men while they were chained up and gagged has been fined for a serious breach of health and safety rules. But it’s nothing to do with the way she physically treated her clients. Lorraine White, 41, was fined £8,000 for breaching fire safety rules at her Stockport sex dungeon. Magistrates heard how the firemen were unable to get into the building after a blaze broke out there. Once they finally did gain access they found a trove of handcuffs, chains and other restraining devices in the basement. Crews were called to the building on Vauxhall industrial estate, Greg Street, on October 30, 2012 after a maintenance man reported a basement fire. They struggled to gain access to the Medusa club due to the locked doors but eventually they managed to enter and discovered the sex dungeon. The fire had been sparked by a leaking gas heater. When questioned, White admitted she had no idea she was responsible for fire safety arrangements.There was only one manually operated fire alarm and one fire exit was permanently locked. Nature of the business: Ms White said her clients cross-dress and are humiliated . Costs: White, who earns £1,100 a month from the business, spent £10,000 refurbishing her smoke-damaged dungeon . Ignorance: White said she had no idea that she was responsible for fire safety measures . Ms White's sex dungeon is located at Vauxhaull Industrial Estate in Stockport . Ordinary home: Ms White lives in a leafy area of Salford . A dominatrix - or 'dom' - isn't a prostitute, but a female who feeds men's appetites to be controlled by a strong woman. Some dominatrixes don't even let their clients touch them. Their trade revolves around BDSM, or bondage, dominance and sado-masochism, with clients paying to be chained-up, whipped and gagged. It's an activity that famously takes place in bestseller Fifty Shades Of Grey. The upcoming movie based on the bestseller stars British actor Jamie Dornan (pictured above with Amelia Warner) as the BDSM-obsessed Christian Grey. A dominatrix will usually wear black and red, tightly fitting clothes made from leather or rubber latex - and high heels. Some might wear a corset to ensure their torso remains in shape. Dominatrixes sometimes let clients use nitrous oxide, sometimes called laughing gas or hippie crack', to attain a feeling of elation. According to talktofrank.com, nitrous oxide has 'several legitimate uses, but when inhaled can make people feel euphoric and relaxed' with some people experiencing hallucinations. It warns that there is a risk of death 'as a lack of oxygen can occur' with the risk increased if the gas 'is consumed in an enclosed space'. The dominatrix trade is legal in Britain - with practitioners only likely to fall foul of the law if they cause clients lasting injuries or marks. Fire investigators found several . canisters of nitrous oxide, laughing gas - also know as 'hippie crack' - . which White’s clients used to get high. Elizabeth Dudley-Jones, . prosecuting, said: ‘She was asked what would happen if there was a fire . when her clients were under the influence of the gas and restrained. ‘She said she had not considered it.’ Ms . Dudley-Jones said White was asked about the activities in the club. ‘She said nothing was too severe. Slight bondage, possibly a mask or . gag. It involved a lot of humiliation, doing domestic work and dressing . up in women’s clothes.’ White, a former beautician, from Chaseley Road, Salford, pleaded guilty to four charges of fire safety rules, including failing to carry out a risk assessment, install suitable fire alarms, maintain emergency exits, or install emergency lighting. She was fined £5,000 for the offences and ordered to pay £3,000 costs and a £120 victim charge. White, who earns £1,100 a month from the business and spent £10,000 refurbishing her smoke-damaged dungeon, agreed to pay the sum at £100-a-month. Peter Grogan, defending, described his client as a small businesswoman of good character. He said the business now fully complied with the fire service requirements. Concluding the case at the Stockport court, Chairman of the bench Michael Johnson said: ‘If you find a business where you can earn more don’t hesitate. Fire prevention chief Peter O’Reilly said: ‘No matter what business you may have, you must take fire safety seriously. ‘In this case the defendant admitted that she didn’t know about the regulations and that she had done nothing to make the premises safe. ‘I would urge all businesses to ensure their risk assessments are up to date and that the proper procedures are in place to give staff and customers the best possible chance of escape in the event of a fire.’","A dominatrix from Stockport was fined £8k for breaching fire safety rules .

A father broke his leg in six places as he was catapulted out of a waterslide into the  wall of a swimming pool at a Turkish resort. Des Jarvis, 46, needed five major operations to save his leg, and doctors say he will never work again. Surgeons had to break the limb in another three places before fitting 18 metal pins and rods. Scroll down for video . Bone-crunching: Des Jarvis (circled) broke his right leg in six places when he skidded off the end of this waterslide with a dangerously short plunge pool in a Turkish holiday resort . Impact: Mr Jarvis was on holiday when he went down the chute and was hurled into the wall of this plunge pool . Injured: After the accident, which was captured on camera, medics were forced to operate to save his leg after Mr Jarvis contracted a potentially fatal bone infection . Injury: Mr Jarvis needed five major operations to save his limb from a bone infection, and doctors were then forced to break his leg in another three places before fitting eighteen metal pins and rods . They removed part of his right tibia, leaving him with a limp as one leg is two inches shorter than the other. Now, there are claims that the slide is too high and steep for the pool, and there is not enough space for an adult to slow down fully after being shot out of the end of the chute. Unbelievably, the slide is still thought to be in use, and five other tourists are now believed to have  been injured. Yesterday, former window fitter Mr Jarvis said: ‘I have no life any more, I can’t go out, get dressed, socialise, nothing. And to add insult to injury, I have been told that I will never be able to go back and do the job I love. It’s all I have known for 24 years and now it’s over.’ Mr Jarvis was on a £5,500 holiday with girlfriend Nikki, 42, and their four children when he suffered the horrific accident at Didim Beach Resort in Altinkum, Turkey, in  summer 2012.

Trip of a lifetime: Mr Jarvis had splashed out £5,500 to take girlfriend Nikki, 42, and their four children to Turkey . As a result of the crash, which was captured on camera, he contracted a potentially fatal bone infection. Only five painful operations saved him from an amputation. Two years on, he is in constant pain – and could still lose his limb. Last October, he had a metal cage fitted around the open wound, which limits his mobility even further. Treatment: Last October Mr Jarvis had a cage fitted around the open wound with a metal plate and screws . Mr Jarvis said: ‘I have lost two inches of my height off my right leg as they had to cut all the infected bone away. And now my leg is in three pieces. ‘My life is a constant battle. My girlfriend has to work as my virtual carer, administering antibiotics and washing me. I can’t go and play football with my son, take [my children] on days out, or go to parents’ evenings. ‘I have to live in my pyjamas every minute of every day because I can’t put any trousers over the cage.’ Mr Jarvis, from Peterborough, said he still has not received compensation from holiday firm First Choice. He said: ‘The holiday company have robbed me of my kids’ childhoods. ‘First Choice have washed their hands of me. I can’t sleep, go out or do anything, and I am in constant pain. But all they want to do is sweep it under the carpet. 'I don’t want anyone else to go through this hell.’ A new video has recently emerged of another tourist having a near miss on the same slide. Mr Jarvis’s solicitor Nick Harris said: ‘It’s bordering on madness that despite Des’s accident the slide remains in use. It’s almost as though someone must be killed before anything will be done.’ The case is being featured on BBC1’s show Holiday Hit Squad tonight, with experts claiming it flouts local safety standards. A spokesman for First Choice said it could not comment for legal reasons, adding: ‘We are sorry to hear about the injuries sustained by Mr Jarvis.

Robert Bastin, lighting a cigarette outside Exeter Magistrates' Court where he admitted stealing a retro penny farthing outside a house in Honiton . A 20-year-old man is facing jail after he stole a penny farthing bicycle so he could get back home - 14 miles away. Robert Bastin stole the bike outside a house in Honiton after Christmas drinks with his brother, a court heard. The jobless labourer rode the stolen bike 14 miles to his flat. The court heard that Bastin decided against returning the bike to Honiton following the theft and instead attempted to sell it on eBay. Defence lawyer Peter Woodley told a court today: 'He was trying to get home. He had had a Christmas Day drink with his brother and it looked like a good idea. 'But a penny farthing is not the easiest thing to return to its owner.' On his eBay listing, Bastin claimed: 'not really my thing prefer my unicycle'. He also maintained that he had only used it three times since new. Devon and Cornwall Police saw the listing on January 12 and placed a £75 bid on the bike. The court heard that Bastin accepted the bid, unaware that it was an undercover police officer. He insisted that the buyer paid cash and collected the bike from his home. Bastin was arrested and the penny farthing was returned to its owner. A penny farthing bicycle similar to the one stolen by Robert Bastin. The retro edition is built by Hawk Cycles in Derby . Robert Bastin stole the bike from Honiton and rode it to his flat in Exeter . Robert Bastin was ordered to return to Exeter Magistrates' Court next month where he will be sentenced . Bastin, of Honiton, Devon, admitted stealing the bike while on bail for other offences. He also admitted aggravated vehicle taking and not having any insurance or licence on December 6. Exeter magistrates court heard that Bastin was riding a motor bike at 5am on the A30 near Exeter airport at speed. The penny farthing was one of the first ever bikes manufactured when it was introduced in 1870. The bicycle received its name due to its distinctive wheels which resembled Victorian penny and farthing coins. It was invented by James Starley and was unusual because the pedals were fixed directly to the front wheel. The penny farthing had solid rubber wheels and a very high centre of gravity - making it very unstable and difficult to ride. It also did not have brakes or suspension. Production eventually ceased in 1878. A new version of the historic bicycle was developed by Hawks Cycles in 2004. It features steel caliper brakes and a modern steel alloy frame costing £150. Police said his riding was 'erratic and wobbly' and he was doing around 20mph over the speed limit before he rode through a red light and through a No Entry sign. Police did not pursue him because they felt it would be unsafe to do so. Later Bastin was arrested by police who discovered DNA evidence linked to the crime from a motorcycle helmet and his clothes. Mr Woodley said the joyriding offence happened at 5am when the main road was 'relatively clear but said it was not the 'worst case of excessive speed' or dangerous driving. He said the jobless labourer was not coping with life over Christmas after losing his job and splitting up from his partner and young child. 'He had no money and was not thinking straight,' said Mr Woodley who said the court had the power to imprison him for a maximum of 12 months. The magistrates ordered an all-options pre-sentencing report - including custody. Bastin was bailed to return to court next month for sentencing.","Robert Bastin claimed he was selling the penny farthing because he preferred his unicycle .

We arrive in Melbourne for the Australian Grand Prix totally unsure of what is going to happen. Some teams look like they will struggle to get their car to the start of the race, let alone the finish. Exciting: Martin Brundle believes the 2014 F1 season will be the wildest one he has ever seen . Curtain raiser: The Australian Grand Prix at Melbourne's Albert Park is the opening race of the 2014 F1 season . I am pretty sure we will have a half-a-dozen crazy races where we are going to see them grappling with the fuel, the tyres, the strategy, the reliability. Indeed, have they done enough practice starts? What about the pit-stops? These are the things the teams usually have under control by now, but they just didn’t complete as much testing as normal over the winter. Last year, the teams completed 11,000 laps between them in testing, but this year they managed only 7,000, and most of that was fundamentally getting their cars working. It hasn’t been fine tuning their race strategy, so who knows? If we get half the cars to the finish in Melbourne I will be impressed and surprised. On the mic: Since retiring from F1 Brundle works as a broadcaster where he is currently at Sky Sports . Blast from the Past: Brundle competed in 158 F1 races, including the 1992 Mexico GP for Benetton Ford . Red Bull have been one of the teams to struggle over the winter and in a way I am not surprised because Adrian Newey has always packaged his cars in an extreme way, and over the full course of time that enabled him to win a lot of championships. He is a purest and he does tend to push the limits which has been his success, but right now, it is giving him some headaches. However, I wouldn’t write them off at all. They obviously have some early gremlins going on but I suspect that underneath that, there is a very competitive race car. But it is whether they can find that car quickly enough, because at the moment they have clearly got a mountain to climb. Williams on the other hand have impressed in pre-season testing. There is a comfort zone in that, like with Manchester Untied and Arsenal doing well, you need Williams to be at the sharp end of Formula One after all their historical success. They have a lot of new personnel there, and they have chosen the right engine - it looks like Mercedes-Benz is the best package - so if you put that all together with a new initiative I am not surprised in the slightest that they are looking so strong. If they won one or more of the first races I would not be surprised either because it is going to be about reliability. Rocky road: Brundle thinks it's going to be a tough campaign for Sebastian Vettel (right) and his Red Bull team . That said, the great drivers are always the great drivers and they will make better use of the tools available to them because they have got greater capacity to think about what is going on around them when they are in the car and out of the car. Ayrton Senna would have loved these cars. He would have maximised all the tools and the levers that they have got available. Legend: Ayrton Senna won three world titles before he died racing for Williams at the 1994 San Marino GP . A world champion probably needs 70 . per cent of his capacity to drive a car and that probably leaves 30 per . cent to work out what is going on around him whereas a good driver needs . 80 per cent of his capacity to drive the car for example. The cream always rises to the top and . the great drivers will still be up front, but I think the thinking . driver has got more of a chance this year. It won’t just be about pedal . to the metal. Team to beat: Brundle believes Mercedes look the strongest outfit ahead of the 2014 F1 season and that their British driver Lewis Hamilton (left) will win his first Drivers' championship since 2008 . Mercedes look the strongest, but they are not bullet-proof either. You will have to think your way through the season, and we know that Nico Rosberg is strong at that. You need to be acrobatic to tame these cars because they have a lot of torque and power and that is where Lewis Hamilton is strong, so I seem them both being contenders. The two teams who with the best chance of evolving more quickly are Mercedes and Ferrari because they are developing the engines, so Hamilton and Rosberg and the Ferrari pair of Fernando Alonso and Kimi Riakkonen should have an advantage by mid-season. Sorely missed: Jenson Button (centre) will be without his dad John (left) in the paddock who died in January . Professional: Brundle believes Button (pictured) will focus on the track despite the loss of his father . Over at McLaren, Jenson Button will feel the passing of his father John most strongly at the first race because he has been part and parcel of his racing career, but Button is a professional. He will get in the car and he will switch all of that off. As a grand prix driver you are quite selfish. Whether you have just had kids or whatever, when you turn up you get on and do the job. You have hundreds of people working for you and you’re the final link in the chain so you have to get the job done and that is exactly what Button will do. But who do I believe will win the world championship? I would not write off Sebastian Vettel like a lot of people have done, but he has a tall order there. I fancy Hamilton to win his second title. Sky Sports F1 is the only place to watch all 19 Grands Prix weekends live on TV, Sky Go and Now TV.","This will be the wildest Formula One season yet .

John Lu, who spread an infection that led to five hospital deaths, will not be compelled to inform NHS patients of his history . A cardiac surgeon who spread an infection that led to five deaths in hospital will not be compelled to inform NHS patients of his history, the High Court ruled today. John Lu claimed that if he was forced to disclose his past to patients, it would render ‘his return to any meaningful practice as a cardiac surgeon impossible’. The surgeon passed on a bug during heart valve surgery between December 2008 and July 2010 at the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust. The outbreak of PVE (Prosthetic Value Endocarditis) a serious heart surgery complication, was found by a coroner to stem from Mr Lu’s habit of swapping gloves during operations. Of 28 heart patients who had valves inserted by him, 11 had fallen ill. Dennis Mills, 82, Michael Smithers, 67, Bernard Heald, 83, Alan Daniels, 73 and Albert Rigley, 63, all died after contracting the staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria. The bug is carried on the skin, but only becomes deadly if it attaches to a foreign body, such as an artificial heart valve. Although Mr Lu has been ‘demonstrably free of the outbreak since 26 May 2010’, he argues that Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust have imposed harsh and disproportionate conditions on his return to work, including compulsory disclosure of his involvement in the scandal. Mr Justice Lewis said the decision whether to inform patients of Lu’s past was ‘ultimately' a matter for the Trust to determine. He said in his judgment: ‘The Trust has been working very sensibly towards a strategy which will inform the potential patients, the public, and other bodies, such as those who refer patients to the Centre, about the return of Mr Lu to surgical duties. ‘In my judgment, that is sensible and does not involve a breach of any express or implied contractual term for at least the following reasons. Mr Justice Lewis said the decision whether to inform patients of Lu's past was 'ultimately' a matter for the Trust to determine. Pictured, Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham . ‘First and foremost, patients and potential patients who may learn about Mr Lu’s return to work need to be reassured that that creates no unacceptable risk and that the arrangements for re-integration are robust. ‘Given the severity of the 2008 and 2009 outbreak, and the deaths that followed, that is sensible. ‘Secondly, the families of those who died and those who were infected but survived also have an interest in knowing that Mr Lu is to return to surgery and the circumstances in which that is to take place. ‘Thirdly, it is sensible from Mr Lu’s perspective. His return to surgical duties, given the circumstances of the outbreak, may be expected to generate media and public interest. ‘It is better that the Trust is prepared to deal, so far as it can, with such interest. ‘Fourthly, those who refer patients to the Centre, or who have other connections with it, may legitimately have an interest in Mr Lu’s return to work. ‘Ultimately, the communication strategy is a matter for the Trust to determine. The entrance to Trent Cardiac Centre in Nottingham, where Mr Lu worked . ‘The Trust, as employer, considers that Mr Lu presents no greater risk of infection than any other cardiac surgeon and there is no requirement, from the employer’s perspective, to require any individual surgeon or clinician to provide additional information over and above that which the individual clinician considers, in the exercise of his clinical judgment, should be provided to enable the patient to give informed consent to any proposed surgery. ‘Individual surgeons and clinicians will therefore have to determine what information, in respect of which types of surgery, they can or should provide to their patients. ‘This judgment does not, and is not intended to, influence the exercise of clinical judgment by any surgeon as to what information should be provided to patients.’ Mr Lu had claimed the Trust’s demands were ‘inaccurate, incomplete and misleading' as to the nature of the risk of a PVE infection and the comparative risk posed by Mr Lu and his other consultant colleagues respectively’. He has been ‘demonstrably free of the outbreak since 26 May 2010’. Mr Lu remains happy to ‘provide full information about the outbreak and his involvement in it to any patient who asks’. The surgeon failed in his claim for ‘loss and damage by reason of the Trust’s breach of contract’.","John Lu passed on a bug that led to five deaths between 2008 and 2010 .

A dying former civil rights lawyer convicted in a terrorism case and sentenced to 10 years in prison was released from prison on Tuesday after prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Prisons made the recommendation to a judge. 'It's just really wonderful,' 74-year-old Lynne Stewart said in a telephone interview after being freed from the Federal Medical Center Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas. 'I'm very grateful to be free. We've been waiting months and months and months.' U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl signed the release order after government lawyers filed a letter in Manhattan federal court earlier Tuesday saying Stewart qualified for early release because she's suffering from breast cancer that has metastasized to her lungs and bones and has less than 18 months to live. Compassionate release: Radical lawyer Lynne Stewart, pictured center arriving at the Fort Worth facility in 2009, has been released from prison because she's dying of breast cancer . 'The director of the Bureau of Prisons contends, and this court agrees, that the defendant's terminal medical condition and very limited life expectancy constitute extraordinary and compelling reasons that warrant the requested reduction,' the judge wrote. He said Stewart, who had been undergoing treatment at the Fort Worth medical center, would be released when travel arrangements could be made. Stewart left hours later with her husband, Ralph Poynter. They were headed home to New York. 'It's a great way to start the new year,' Poynter said. Stewart was convicted of helping a blind Egyptian sheik communicate with followers while he was serving a life sentence in a plot to blow up five New York landmarks and assassinate then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

She has been imprisoned since 2009 and wasn't scheduled for release until August 2018. She was first diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2005. The cancer went into remission but was discovered to have recurred after she was imprisoned. Supporters had rallied to get her released. 'Despite aggressive treatment, doctors have advised that her prognosis is poor,' the prosecutors' letter said, adding she also has been diagnosed with anemia, high blood pressure, asthma and Type 2 diabetes. Stewart also had written to the judge, saying she didn't want to die in 'a strange and loveless place' and wanted to go home.

A previous compassionate-release request was denied in part on the grounds that Stewart had more than 18 months to live, though the judge said he would act promptly if the Federal Bureau of Prisons agreed she had less than 18 months to live and granted a compassionate-release application. A federal appeals court in 2012 upheld Stewart's 10-year sentence, saying she earned it through serious crimes that she refused to acknowledge. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it was fair to boost Stewart's sentence from the two years and four months she was given in 2006. The three-judge panel that had ordered Stewart to be resentenced said it disagreed with her claim that her sentence was 'shockingly high.' It accused her of exhibiting a 'stark inability to understand the seriousness of her crimes.'","'It's just really wonderful,' 74-year-old Lynne Stewart said after being freed from the Federal Medical Center Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas, January 1 .

A medical student today warned young people not to make New Year's resolutions after she gave up chocolate as a bit of fun as a child - and became anorexic. Annabelle Harris, 25, from Solihull, West Midlands, cut the sugary snack from her diet when she was nine years old as a personal challenge after eating too much over Christmas in 1997. But her New Year's resolution soon became an obsession and within months she began skipping meals after becoming convinced she was overweight. Annabelle Harris from Solihull warns against New Year's resolutions after becoming anorexic as a child . She did everything she could to avoid consuming carbohydrates and even diluted skimmed milk with water because she was convinced she would get fat. Shockingly, by the age of 13 her weight had plunged to under five stone and she was admitted to an adolescent psychiatric unit in Birmingham after falling critically ill. She stayed there for three ears and continued to battle with the disease until she went to university. But, at 21, she again lost too much weight and was rushed to hospital when she suffered organ failure as a result of being so undernourished. Finally she beat the disease and is now studying to be a doctor. Annabelle today warns youngsters not to crash diet in the New Year. At home in Solihull aged eight (left); Annabelle (pictured right, now) says she used to look at her body and think she was fat . 'When I was nine, I looked at my body and thought I looked fat so I made my New Year's resolution, I banned chocolate,' she says. 'But at the age of 13, I started cutting out carbs and fats.

I think it was possibly a number of factors - a genetic disposition, my personality and the fact that I was bullied at school. 'My mother thought I was underweight. She took me to the GP, who asked me whether I had a problem. 'I said no. I thought I was just being sensible about what I ate. 'And on the third time she took me to the surgery, she was told she was fussing. There was nothing to worry about. 'She wasn't having it, finally, she took me to a different GP who said straight away that I had quite severe anorexia and referred me to a specialist. 'I couldn't believe I was anorexic, I didn't think that was me, I felt I quite enjoyed food.'I've since read that most anorexics feel the same way.

I had completely lost my emotional response. There were other kids in there and we got on quite well. The staff made it a friendly place.

Error: The club seem to have been unaware that Miyaichi hadn't been at the club for three years . Miyaichi, not named on Arsenal's 'A' list for Champions League games, was assumed to be on the 'B' list for players under the age of 21 that have been at the club for three years or longer. However, with the Japanese winger having had time out on loan at Wigan Athletic, Bolton Wanderers and Feyenoord, the 21-year-old has not solely been at the club for a total of three years, meaning he was ineligble for the B list, also. Miyaichi was taken off list A earlier in the season, with January signing Kim Kallstrom added, assuming he would be on list B. It meant Wenger could only name six substitutes instead of seven, leaving Miyaichi stranded after flying out to Germany with the Arsenal team on Tuesday.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 15:20 EST, 14 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:18 EST, 14 March 2014 . An Indian diplomat was re-indicted today on U.S. visa fraud charges that touched off an international furore after she was arrested and strip-searched last year. The new indictment, filed on Friday, essentially just reinstates recently-dismissed charges against the diplomat Devyani Khobragade - charges that now arrive with her out of the country. A judge threw out last year's virtually identical indictment on Wednesday on diplomatic immunity grounds, but the ruling left a door open to reviving the case and federal prosecutors quickly suggested they would. It accuses Khobragade of lying to the U.S. government to get her housekeeper a work visa. Scroll down for video . Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade (center) pictured with her father Uttam Khobragade (left) in January has been re-indicted in the U.S. today after visa fraud charges against her were recently dismissed . Khobragade's lawyer, Daniel Arshack, had no immediate comment on Friday. He said on Wednesday that re-indicting his client 'might be viewed an aggressive act and one that (prosecutors) would be ill-advised to pursue'. Khobragade is back in India. There was no immediate response to messages left at India's embassy in Washington and consulate in New York. It's unclear when, if ever, she might appear in court in New York again. It's unlikely she would ever be forced to appear through extradition. The U.S. State Department had filed court papers opposing Khobragade's bid to get the charges dismissed and stands by it, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters Friday in Washington. Khobragade was a deputy consul general in New York when she was arrested in December near her children's Manhattan school. Prosecutors say she told the government she was paying her Indian housekeeper $4,500 per month while actually paying her less than $3 per hour and often making her work up to 100 hours a week. 'Khobragade did not want to pay the victim the required wages under law or provide the victim with other protections against exploitative work conditions mandated by U.S. law,' the indictment says. In the initial case, she pleaded not guilty and argued she was immune from prosecution. Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard (pictured), filed a court petition in New Delhi last year saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat Devyani Khobragade . The arrest sparked an outcry in India, particularly because of the strip-search. The U.S. Marshals said Khobragade was treated no differently than others who are arrested, and U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said she indeed was afforded courtesies most Americans wouldn't get, such as being allowed to make phone calls for two hours to arrange child care and sort out personal matters. Bharara, who is himself Indian-born, also said Khobragade wasn't handcuffed, restrained or arrested in front of her children and was given coffee and offered food while detained. And he questioned why there was such a furor over what Khobragade experienced but 'precious little outrage' over how the housekeeper was allegedly treated. Still, many in India saw the arrest as deeply disrespectful. Indian officials also said the housekeeper, Sangeeta Richard, had tried to blackmail the diplomat; Richard's advocates disputed that. Safe Horizon, an anti-human-trafficking group that represents Richard, said earlier this week it hoped Khobragade would face a new indictment, calling the case 'a tremendous opportunity to demonstrate our nation's commitment to fighting exploitation of workers'. The arrest roiled U.S.-Indian relations, with India taking such steps as removing concrete traffic barriers around the U.S. Embassy and revoking diplomats' ID cards. After being indicted, Khobragade complied with a Department of State request to leave the U.S., and the Indian government then asked Washington to withdraw a diplomat from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. The U.S. complied. Devyani Khobragade was charged with visa fraud and making false statements. She faces prosecution if she returns to the States . When Khobragade was arrested, U.S. officials said her status as a consular officer provided immunity limited to acts performed in the exercise of official functions. She disagreed. Then, on the day before her Jan. 9 indictment, she was accredited to India's U.N. mission, a role that conferred wider immunity. U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin decided in a ruling Wednesday that the later appointment gave Khobragade immunity when indicted and meant that indictment had to be dismissed, without settling the question of whether the alleged crimes would have been considered ""official acts"" covered by the earlier, more limited immunity. But the judge wrote that there was 'no bar to a new indictment against Khobragade', whose immunity ended when she left the country. She still works in foreign affairs for the Indian government, but now in New Delhi, according to Arshack.","The new indictment, filed on Friday, .

A banker who vanished in an apparent suicide in 2012 and was wanted by the FBI in connection with a $20 million wire fraud case has been arrested in Georgia after being pulled over for a minor traffic violation. Aubrey Lee Price, 47, was arrested after being stopped for a tinted window violation on Interstate 95 by members of the Glynn County Sheriff's Department on Wednesday. Officers said that it was clear Price was giving them false information during the stop and they were soon able to determine that he was wanted by the FBI. Scroll down for video . Back form the dead: Former bank director Aubrey Lee Price was caught by police on Wednesday, right, after he had been missing since June 2012, . when he had told family members he was going to commit suicide . His arrest comes more than a year after a Florida judge had declared Price to be legally dead. Despite the judge's ruling, the FBI had continued to search for him and had offered a reward of up to $20,000 for his capture. Price is due to make his initial appearance before a federal judge in Brunswick on Thursday. He disappeared in June 2012 after sending a rambling letter to his family and acquaintances that investigators took to be a confession. Raid: Officials believe that Price raised $40million from more than 100 investors in Georgia and Florida through an unregistered investment . fund that he managed . Price disappeared in June 2012 after sending a rambling letter to his family and acquaintances that investigators described as a confession . A Florida judge declared him dead a . year ago, but the FBI had said it didn't believe Price was dead and . continued to search for him. Prosecutors . have said Price had raised roughly $40 million from about 115 . investors, mostly in Georgia and Florida, through the sale of membership . interests in his investment firm. Authorities believe Price slipped away with up to $17 million of investors' money. He has been indicted in federal courts in New York and Georgia, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a complaint against him in federal court in Atlanta. FBI Special Agent Stephen Emmett said that he didn't know whether Price's wife and children had known that he was still alive. His family had previously told investigators they believed Price was dead. Price left his home in south Georgia on June 16, 2012, telling his family he was headed to Guatemala for business, authorities have said. Two days later, Price's family and acquaintances received letters saying he was going to Key West to board a ferry headed to Fort Meyers and planned to jump off somewhere along the way to end his life. ‘My depression and discouragement have driven me to deep anxiety, fear and shame. I am emotionally overwhelmed and incapable of continuing in this life,’ said a rambling confession letter investigators believe was written by Price. Web: Price allegedly forged bank documents to hide the millions of loses his investors suffered, so that they would continue giving him money . ‘I created false statements, covered up my losses and deceived and hurt the very people I was trying to help,’ the letter said. Credit card records showed he purchased dive weights and a ferry ticket. The ferry ticket was scanned at the boarding point, and security camera footage released by the FBI about six weeks after his disappearance showed Price at the Key West, Fla., airport and ferry terminal on the day he disappeared. Price owned real estate in Venezuela and had told people he frequently went there and to Guatemala. The FBI said in February that investigators had accounted for all the vehicles Price owned, except for a 17-foot fiberglass boat. The agency said at the time that it was possible Price had used the boat to flee and may still be using it. Search: The FBI continued to believe that Price was alive and had offered $20,000 for information that could lead to his capture . Price became director of Montgomery Bank & Trust in Ailey, Ga., in December 2010, when a company he controlled bought a controlling portion of the bank's stock, according to a complaint filed in June 2012 in federal court in New York. Price then opened brokerage accounts through a securities clearing and custodial firm in New York and told bank managers he would invest in U.S. Treasury securities. Instead of investing the bank's money, authorities say Price wired the funds into accounts he controlled at other financial institutions and provided bank managers with fraudulent documents. Price lived with his wife and children in Bradenton, Fla., but bought a home in Valdosta in the months before his disappearance, according to authorities. Price had moved his family to the south Georgia city, where his wife's parents lived, just a few weeks before he disappeared.","Aubrey Lee Price, 47, was arrested on Wednesday after pulled over on a minor traffic violation in Georgia .

Scientists believe we could be closer to developing a drug that gives us the benefits of exercising without moving a muscle. A studies has shown that a compound affected levels of a protein called REV-ERB in muscles - which has been shown to boost metabolism, normalise cholesterol levels and affect how much we sleep. Experts hope that the compound could one day help disabled people get the benefits of exercise without having to move. A study has found that a new compound affected levels of a protein called REV-ERB, which has been shown to boost metabolism, normalise cholesterol levels and affect how much we sleep . The study, published this week by researchers at the Scripps Research Institute in Florida, found that when their compound was injected . into obese mice, it helped them lose weight - even if they were on a high-fat diet - and improved their cholesterol levels, according to a New York Times report. The treated mice also began using more oxygen throughout the day and expending about 5 per cent more energy than untreated mice, even though they were not moving about more than the other animals. This in effect means the compound boosted their metabolism. Scripps scientists also worked with researchers at the Pasteur Institute in France and other institutions, to discover what their compound might be doing inside muscles to provide this 'invisible' exercise. Experts have discovered that a compound they formulated affected proteins in the muscles which in turn mimicked an intensive workout . They knew that their drug increased the potency of the REV-ERB protein, but no one knew what it actually did to muscles. They therefore developed a strain of mice that could not express very much of the protein in their muscle cells. These animals were what they described as 'anti-athletes'. One of the hallmarks of regular aerobic exercise is that it increases the number and activity of the mitochondria, the cellular structures that help to generate energy while consuming oxygen, in the muscles. But these animalsâ€™ muscles contained very few mitochondria. As a result, the animals had diminished endurance, with a maximam oxygen capacity about 60 percent lower than normal. They reached exhaustion on treadmill testing long before their unaffected labmates. But when, in a separate part of the experiment, scientists added their compound to isolated muscle cells from the deficient mice, the cells began pumping out far more REV-ERB. Those cells, subsequently, began creating large numbers of new mitochondria and strengthening the existing ones. The drug act as an exercise mimic, explained co-author Thomas Burris, now the chairman of the department of pharmacological and physiological science at St Louis University School of Medicine. It is not inconceivable, he added, that at some point in the future, such a drug might allow people, especially those who are disabled or canâ€™t otherwise exercise, to enjoy the health benefits of endurance without the exertion.","Scientists discovered that when a compound they created was injected in mice, it boosted metabolism, endurance and improved cholesterol levels .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:06 EST, 14 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 22:07 EST, 14 March 2014 . Failings last spring by nuclear missile operators at an Air Force base in North Dakota were worse than first reported, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press. Airmen responsible for missile operations at Minot Air Force Base would have failed their portion of a major inspection in March 2013 but managed a 'marginal' rating because their poor marks were blended with the better performance of support staff - like cooks and facilities managers - and they got a boost from the base's highly rated training program. The 'marginal' rating, the equivalent of a 'D' in school, was reported previously. Now, details of the low performance by the launch officers, or missileers, entrusted with the keys to missiles have been revealed. 'Missileer technical proficiency substandard,' one Air Force briefing slide says. 'Remainder (of missile operations team) raised grade to marginal.' Problems on the base: Minot Air Force Base missileers are embroiled in a cheating scandal . The documents also hint at an exam-cheating problem in the making among launch crews at Minot, almost a full year before allegations of widespread cheating erupted this January at a companion nuclear base in Montana. An official inquiry into the troubled inspection of the 91st Missile Wing at Minot in March 2013 concluded that one root cause was poor use of routine testing and other means of measuring the proficiency of launch crews in their assigned tasks. For example, commanders at Minot did not ensure that monthly written tests were supervised. The analysis also said Minot senior leaders failed to foster a ""culture of accountability"" and that mid-level leadership posts were left unfilled. In a more direct hint at fudging on exams, one document said, 'Group testing' was viewed as 'taking care of each other,'"" while adding that the missileers felt pressure to score 100 percent on every test. Those are echoes of explanations Air Force leaders have recounted from launch officers in the aftermath of the cheating scandal that surfaced in early January at the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Mont. At least 92 officers at Malmstrom have been removed from launch duty for allegedly cheating or tolerating cheating by others, pending an investigation whose results may be released by the end of this month. The allegation at Malmstrom is that information on 'emergency war orders' exams, which test how a launch crew would handle classified messages related to missile targeting and launch, was shared in advance among launch officers. It's not clear whether this or other forms of cheating have taken place at the Air Force's two other ICBM bases, but numerous former missileers have said in recent weeks that cheating does occur. Not up to par: It has also been revealed that, if not for averaging scores together with cooks, missileers would not have passed competency tests . Without specifically mentioning the cheating scandal, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Howard 'Buck' McKeon, said Friday that while the vast majority of airmen in the nuclear missile corps are reliable and committed, he worries about the impact of reported shortcomings. 'A few bad eggs put at risk the mission and taint the record of the rest of the Air Force,' McKeon said at a hearing where Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James and the Air Force chief of staff, Gen. Mark Welsh, were testifying on the 2015 defense budget. 'That cannot be allowed to happen.' The Air Force operates a total of 450 Minuteman 3 nuclear missiles, divided evenly among the three bases. An ICBM base has many interconnected pieces, including security forces that provide protection for the missiles and for the underground launch control centers, as well as commanders and others who work from a headquarters base. But at the mission's core are the missileers and their mastery of 'emergency war orders,' the secret messages that would authorize a launch. They are supported in the missile field by personnel known as facility managers, who run above-ground support buildings where security forces and others sleep and where cooks prepare meals for the full team. The Air Force initially called the overall March inspection outcome at Minot a 'success,' reflecting the fact that the 91st Missile Wing as a whole was rated 'satisfactory.' But after The Associated Press learned in May about the 'marginal' performance in the missile operations sector of the inspection, the service disclosed that 19 officers had been forced to surrender their launch authority in April because of performance and attitude problems. That was an unprecedented mass sidelining of launch control officers, reflecting what the 91st's deputy operations commander at the time, Lt. Col. Jay Folds, called 'rot' in the force. On the defensive: Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James, left, joined at right by Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. Mark Welsh, testifying Friday before the House Armed Services Committee . Until now, however, it was not publicly known that of 11 crews tested on a launch simulator for the inspection, three were rated Q3, or 'unqualified,' which the Air Force defines as demonstrating 'an unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge.' Five of the 11 earned a top rating and three got a second-tier rating. The Minot crews performed much better in a September reassessment. Eleven of 12 launch crews received top qualification ratings, although one was rated unqualified with 'one critical and one major error.' In back-to-back inspections this January, the 91st as a whole was given outstanding marks. The newly available Air Force documents were released to a private group in Philadelphia called Speaking Truth to Power after the group filed a lawsuit asserting that U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees all U.S. nuclear forces, had not provided documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act. That private group, headed by lawyer Jules Zacher, advocates for the elimination of nuclear weapons. He shared the documents with the AP. Problems inside the ICBM force - many of them first reported by the AP - prompted Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in January to order two reviews. A Pentagon team is seeking to define and fix the trouble, and an outside group is undertaking a broader assessment of nuclear weapons operations. Hagel has said failures in this most sensitive of military missions threaten to erode public trust. Chief of Staff of Air Force Gen. Mark Welsh testifies before the House Armed Services Committee, the hearing was meant to debate the fiscal year 2015 budget, but revelations of the under-performing missileers were also discussed . Madelyn Creedon, co-leader of the internal review, was at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., on Thursday to review how the Air Force's ICBM launch crew training program is operated. All launch crews are required to train at Vandenberg before being certified and assigned to one of the three operational ICBM bases. One newly released document said the Minot wing in North Dakota had shown signs of weakness much earlier. In an April-May 2010 'combat capability evaluation,' two of 13 launch crews tested on the use of a launch simulator were deemed 'unqualified.' Eight rated ""highly qualified' and three 'qualified.' By comparison, of 32 crews who underwent the same evaluation at the two other ICBM bases in 2011, 31 were rated either highly qualified or qualified and only one unqualified. On routine written tests, the Minot group did exceptionally well until the spring of 2013. In assessing the problems at Minot, the Air Force produced an analysis of test data that showed that in the two years prior to the March 2013 inspection, 87 percent of all tests resulted in perfect scores. In the three months following the weak inspection, 46 percent of test scores were perfect, including just 20 percent in May. It also found that errors on monthly written tests and errors on launch control simulators soared after the March inspection. In the 10 months of written tests prior to its inspection, the Minot missileers had a total of 162 'job performance requirement' errors, which are mistakes on what the Air Force considers essential tasks. In the three months following the inspection the total doubled, to 321 errors, according to the data analysis. Air Force officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. After visiting all three ICBM bases days after the Malmstrom cheating scandal was disclosed, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said she was troubled to hear that missileers 'felt driven to score 100 percent all the time 'because commanders use scores as the main, or only, factor in promotions. James called this ""unhealthy.' She is weighing recommendations on ways to reform testing and training. But the newly released Air Force documents show the focus on perfection should not be a surprise. One document that examined emergency war order test scores said, 'Given the nature of the ICBM crew mission, a perfect score is the expectation.' The pressure to be perfect apparently has driven some to cheat and others, possibly including commanders, to look the other way. There is no evidence that this has translated to unsafe handling of nuclear weapons duties, but an Air Force review found 'a culture of toleration' at Minot that 'allowed unprofessional and non-compliant behaviors.' It said launch crews had an ""artificial sense of preparedness"" for tests and inspections.","Minot Air Force base missile operators competency grades were actually below passing, but barely passed when averaged with other employees .
Those other employees included cooks and janitors - people who have no interaction with the nuclear missiles .
These revelations came during hearings on a cheating scandal at the maligned facility ."

A Wesleyan University student who says she was raped during a drunken 'strip show party' at a fraternity house has filed a federal lawsuit against the organization, the alleged assailant and 11 other frat members that were at the party. The lawsuit says the student, a freshman, was raped in the common room of the Psi Upsilon fraternity house at 242 High Street while surrounded by other students during a wild house party last May, NBC Connecticut reported. According to the lawsuit, the female student went to Middlesex Hospital after the party. She was evaluated with a rape kit that confirmed she had been sexually assaulted. Scroll down for video . Scene: The alleged rape occurred at the Psi Upsilon fraternity house at 242 High Street in may 2013. The victim is seeking $1 million in damages . The alleged assailant was expelled from Wesleyan University following the rape incident last year. The victim has taken a leave of absence . The victim claims when she got to the party she realized it was 'pledge strip show' and that a number people were removing their clothes. When she went to leave, she was picked up from behind by a guy who put her on a tabletop and started grinding up against her. She was then raped over the arm of a couch, with numerous people in the common room at the time. The alleged assailant was later expelled. The victim has taken a leave of absence and is seeking to $1 million in damages for medical and psychological treatment. The suit holds both the national fraternity and local organization accountable, but does not name Wesleyan University. It is the second time the fraternity has come under fire with rape allegations. 'I can't even describe the pain of being raped, or how much it alters a life, and no other person should ever be forced to have that experience,' the victim stated in the lawsuit. 'I hope my experience and lawsuit will create changes that protect others.' The basis of the suit is negligence. Wesleyan University, in Middletown, Connecticut, has not been named in the lawsuit. The suit instead targets the fraternity and the people involved . 'Despite demanding self-governance, the Fraternity Defendants fail to adequately and reasonably train themselves and abide by such responsibilities, particularly with respect to safety/risk management issues involving fraternity events, events inside the fraternity house, security, sexual abuse prevention, hazing, and the use and misuse of alcohol,' it reads. Psi Upsilon Fraternity Executive Director Tom Fox said the national organization was notified of the lawsuit on Wednesday. 'Psi Upsilon Fraternity takes all reports of risk management violations, especially those with regard to sexual assault, very seriously,' Fox said in a statement. 'We are currently investigating the incident and gathering further information.' Fox added that all members of the organization are required to complete an online program encompassing alcohol, hazing and sexual assault education. Wesleyan University President Michael S. Roth provided The Hartford Courant with a written statement that says there have been sanctions against the university. 'On behalf of the university community, I want to express our horror at this shameful assault,' said Roth said in the statement. 'Sexual violence on college campuses is a national problem, and it's important to raise awareness about this issue.' The female student has taken a leave of absence from the university.","Rape occurred at the Psi Upsilon fraternity house in May 2013 .

A decorated military commander, hailed as one of Britain's greatest, has been accused of molesting children while serving as the Queen's representative in Australia. Field Marshal William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim, has been accused of abusing the youngsters who attended a school for underprivileged children. Victims in Australia have come forward, claiming they were abused by the First and Second World War veteran, who died in 1970 at the age of 79. Accused: Field Marshal Viscount William Slim has been accused of molesting children at Fairbridge Farm School in south western Australia, while he served as Governor-General to the country. He is pictured (right) inspecting the troops during the Burma Campaign during the Second World War . School: The majority of pupils at Fairbridge Farm School, of which Viscount Slim was a patron, were British migrants . The Telegraph reported Bob Stevens, has filed a lawsuit against Fairbridge Farm, a school near Pinjarra in south western Australia. Mr Stevens claims Viscount Slim would arrive at the school in his Rolls Royce and 'the next minute we were sitting on his knee and he's got his hands up our trousers'. The majority of pupils at the school were British migrants. Mr Stevens was sent to Fairbridge from England at the age of eight. He has given testimony in private to Australia's royal commission into child abuse. The former pupil is also preparing to apply to the commissioner to have Viscount Slim stripped of his peerage. Another former student, David Hill, who has written a book about the school and is former managing director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, said he is aware of two other boys who claim they were also molested by Viscount Slim. Victims: The allegations against Viscount Slim (left with his wife Lady Slim and right) as 65 alleged victims of abuse filed a lawsuit against Fairbridge Farm School . Viscount Slim (right) died in 1970 at the age of 79 . The alleged abuse happened while Viscount Slim was serving in Australia as Governor-General from 1953 to 1960. The claims came to light as 65 alleged victims of abuse took action against Fairbridge Farm School, of which Viscount Slim was patron. Mr Stevens said the abuse he suffered at the hands of Viscount Slim 'has never left me and it can't leave me'. He told ABC news: 'He used to visit Fairbridge and we were all in some cases given rides in his Rolls-Royce car. 'I don't care how brilliant a man he might have been militarily, if he abused children the way I was abused and others, I don't think people like that have the right to continue... in terms of peerage that goes on from family to family to family. I think that it's outrageous.' Viscount Slim fought in both world wars. He led the Fourteenth Army, the so-called 'Forgotten Army' to victory against the Japanese in Burma during the Second World War.

According to a criminal complaint filed by the State of Nevada, the coin collection of David Walters was stolen from his home in November by his niece, Jennifer Beckman. It is alleged Ms Beckman took the collection, which includes a rare 1903 St. Gaudens $20 gold piece and silver Morgan coins from the 1880s, to the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, featured in popular History Channel TV series 'Pawn Stars'. The shop featured in Pawn Stars, starring (left to right) Corey Harrison, Rick Harrison and Richard Harrison, has reportedly melted down a stolen gold coin collection . ABC reports that a Detective Watkins of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department says in a deposition filed with the complaint that Beckman received $12,375 over three visits. Mr Walters did not notice the coins were gone until November 27 and in early December the detective says he contacted Gold & Silver so they could be returned to Mr Walters - but they were already gone. Under Nevada law, customers must present identification, and every item sold to a pawn shop must be entered into a database for police to see.

A judge sentenced a Wisconsin man to 27 years in state prison Friday for drugging and sexually assaulting eight women. Dane County Circuit Judge William Hanrahan said 29-year-old Brian Stowe will first serve 15 years in federal prison for his January conviction of sexual exploitation of a child. After that, Stowe will spend 27 years in state prison on the 27 felony counts he pleaded guilty to in December â€” 16 counts of sexual assault and 11 counts of taking or possessing sexually explicit images of his victims. The Madison resident kept his head down Friday as, one by one, three victims took the stand to give statements, each describing Stowe as a friend who would do favors for them. One described him as 'like a brother' to her. Predator: 29-year-old Brian Stowe faced more than 400 years in prison for sexually assaulting eight women, including one minor . The judge's voice wavered as he described a 'cold and calculated' series of attacks. 'The devastation ... is spread far and wide in this community and it makes us all feel less safe,' Hanrahan said. Police arrested Stowe last year after a 17-year-old girl reported that he drugged and sexually assaulted her as she lay unconscious in bed in October 2012, and took photos and videos of it. Madison police widened the investigation after the 17-year-old girl came forward, searching his apartment in November 2012 and finding images of more women on his computer and other devices. None of the women knew Stowe took photos and video of them while they were unconscious and all expressed shock at the discovery of the explicit content on Stowe's computer. Some of the victims worked with Stowe at Epic Systems, a health software company in Verona, a Madison suburb, while prosecutors say photos of one woman were taken during an out-of-state business trip in 2010. Before he was sentenced, Stowe said: 'I'm not going to have the normal life I would have had I not committed these acts. Please do see the good that does exist in me.' Five of the eight victims were in the courtroom on Friday, and one called in. The Associated Press doesn't generally identify women in sexual assault cases. Sentenced: Judge William Hanrahan handed down Stowe's sentence for his 'cold and calculated attacks on multiple women . Hanrahan pointed out Friday that there was no physical evidence that Stowe drugged the women, but said he'd seen the video and that investigators found a file on Stowe's computer labeled 'drug assaults.' The 17-year-old told police that she and Stowe shared a cab home and that he told her he'd take her home. Instead, she fell asleep in his apartment after drinking a glass of water, she told the police. U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb said during the federal sentencing that at one point during the video Stowe made that the girl asked Stowe, ""What are you doing?"" Prosecutors initially charged Stowe, who has dual U.S. and British citizenship, with 62 felonies, but his plea deal reduced it to 27. The state asked for a sentence of 130 1/2 years, 84 1/2 in prison and 46 under extended supervision. Stowe's attorney had asked for the minimum bail that would protect the public and provide rehabilitation and punishment to Stowe.","Prosecutors asked that Brian Stowe receive a sentence of 130 years .

The 40-year-old was found beside the A66 on Thursday and was taken to hospital where he was put into a medically-induced coma. He regained consciousness yesterday but was in too much pain to be interviewed by police. Officers from the Cleveland force closed part of the dual carriageway on Friday to search for the missing manhood, but have not been able to find it. Attack: Kelvin 'Kelly' Hewitt (pictured), the man who had his penis cut off near Middlesbrough,  is the father of at least seven children by three different women, it has been revealed . Mr Hewitt (left, kissing an unknown blonde woman) has regained consciousness after being put into a medically induced coma, but was unable to talk to police officers . Possible connection: The man was attacked near a gipsy campsite on John Boyle Road on Teesside . Motive: It's thought that the gipsy gang (not necessarily connected to the picture) cut off the man's penis for sleeping with one of their girlfriends . Standstill: Police closed a busy dual carriageway to hunt for a man's penis after he was discovered severely injured at the side of the road . Distressed: The 40-year-old was discovered in a distressed state on the side of the A66 dual carriageway in Middlesbrough on Thursday morning . A 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault in relation to the incident and was released on bail . Mr Hewitt is thought to be in a relationship with Carla Hill, who is a mother to two of his children, and has an ex-partner Debbie Lewis who he has four more children with. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Ms Lewis said: 'They're devastated. I've had two in tears since all this came out.' Leanne Trewitt, 22, another of Hewitt's children from a third partner, posted on Facebook yesterday: 'My dad's stable now just hoping for a speedy recovery. Love you papa smurf!' Her friends flooded her page with get-well messages after she posted the above note. Cleveland police said: 'The victim remains in hospital and is now conscious. Officers visited him today but were unable to carry out a detailed interview. 'They hope to speak to him today or tomorrow to establish exactly how his injuries were sustained. Inquiries are on-going.' Mr Hewitt was discovered in a distressed state on the side of the A66 . dual carriageway. The builder, originally from Redcar, moved on to the Heaven Traveller's Site at South Bank about six years ago. A cordon around a blood-spattered caravan, believed to be where the attack took place, was removed yesterday. Facebook comment: Mr Hewitt recently posted a message about a meal he had at McDonald's on the A66, close to where he was attacked . Despite regaining consciousness Mr Hewitt faces a long period of recovery and will need extensive plastic surgery. Dr Raj Persad, a consultant urologist, told MailOnline that a new penis could be constructed even if the original tissue is lost. He said: 'The best hope is that doctors have kept the tissue in a viable way so the penis can be reconnected. If the tissue is no longer viable, the options are limited. 'It may be possible to make a phallus – rather like that created in gender reassignment surgery. Here, tissue expanders can be used to create a flap of tissue that can be rolled into a phallus. The urethra would also have to be reconstructed.' A . member of staff at Asda close to where the incident happened said he . heard that a man had suffered the horrendous injury to his groin. He added: 'A few of the Asda staff have been talking and apparently it was some gipsy men doing it to another guy after they found out he had slept with one of their girlfriends. 'I don't know his name but that seems to be what I have heard.' Although police at the time would only say that the . man had suffered serious injuries and wounds to his groin area, around eight officers were seen combing a grass verge at the side of the road, while tape was used to seal off a section of the carriageway. It's believed that they were searching for the missing body part. Officers search the verge of the dual carriageway for the man's organ and other forensic evidence . A member of staff at Asda close to where the incident happened said he heard the victim had suffered a horrendous injury to his groin . Road block: This stretch of the A66 was sealed off by police investigating the incident . The road closed some time between 4.20am . and 9am and was open again by midday. The police closed east bound . carriageway first while they searched, then west bound. A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault in relation to the incident was held in police custody on Thursday. He was bailed pending further enquiries. Mr Hewitt was found at 4.50am and was taken to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. Ambulance: Mr Hewitt was found at 4.50am with serious injuries and was taken to hospital . Investigation: Officers were said to be 'keeping an open mind' as to how the man was injured . 'The road closures were required as part of the investigation into how the man received his injuries,' said a police spokesman. 'This . is necessary so that officers can look for anything which may shed . light on how he became injured or his direction of travel.' The police had taped off a Vauxhall Zafira on a nearby gipsy site. He added: 'If the road was not closed any evidence could be lost or destroyed.' 'Investigations are at a very early stage.' Missing: It is understood that his penis had been cut off and was missing, prompting officers to close sections of the route in order to search for it . The spokesman added: 'Officers are keeping an open mind as to how he received his injuries and key to this will be speaking to the man himself when they are able to do so.' A second man who did not wish to be named said: 'I work on an industrial site close to where it happened. 'When I came into work this morning it was bedlam because the whole place was at a standstill. 'Nobody has told us what has happened, we heard there had been a body found and that there had been a stabbing but these could just be rumours.' Mr Nim Christopher, a leading expert in penile reconstruction at University College London Hospitals, told MailOnline: ‘For a complete penile reconstruction, a procedure called a free flap phalloplasty is performed. This involves taking a chunk of tissue still intact (in terms of nerves, veins, arteries) from another part of the body. This is then rolled into a tube like a sausage roll with a pipe inside it for the urethra.’ Parts of the body where skin may be taken from are the arm or the thigh. The tissue is then transplanted onto the groin area and the nerves, arteries and veins are connected. Cosmetic surgery is then performed to give the transplanted penis the appearance of one that has been circumcised. The whole procedure usually takes three operations and sensation – if it returns at all – can take a long time while the nerves heal. If a man wishes to be sexually active, he can undergo surgery to have a ‘penis pump’ device implanted. Here, two cylinders are placed either side in the tissue and these are connected to a pump in the scrotum. Squeezing the pump fills the cylinders with fluid kept in a reservoir in the abdomen. This type of surgery can be very successful and save sexual relations when all else has failed. But there are some risks attached to the operation, though, including infection and damage to the penis. A man who had been walking his dog through the area when police started closing the roads said: 'From what I could gather there had been some sort of stabbing. 'I asked an officer what was going on and he said there was no risk to the public but someone had been seriously injured, they said it was just an individual incident though.' A man working in nearby ScS Sofas said: 'There has been a heavy police presence in the area all day, they have been walking around the area and generally chatting to public. 'Lots of people have said there had been a stabbing but that they had heard it from someone else so it was probably just rumours. 'Whatever it was it must have been pretty serious for them to have closed the roads for so long, it was a nightmare getting into work this morning. 'People have been coming in and asking if we knew what had happened but we had no idea either. 'I instantly thought it must have been a road accident seeing as they closed the roads.' A lady taking her shopping from Asda said: 'I know there has been a man hurt but there hasn't been much else said on the matter. 'There . is a lot of gossip about a stabbing but it could just be rumours with a . lot of people speculating over what it could be and coming to their own . conclusions.' Two community support officers who were patrolling said a man had been seriously injured earlier today. They said 'no comment' when asked if a man's penis had been chopped off. All road closures have now been lifted.","Kelvin 'Kelly' Hewitt, 40, believed to have had penis cut off by gipsies .

"By . Meghan Keneally . and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 12:04 EST, 14 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 14:36 EST, 14 March 2014 . Federal reports have revealed that terrorists would only have to sabotage nine out of the 55,000 electric-transmission substations across the U.S. in order to cause a national blackout that could last for more than a year. A coast-to-coast blackout has become a very harrowing- and plausible- prospect that has scared federal regulators into issuing warnings calling for widespread security precautions to be put into place. The Wall Street Journal has published the findings from a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that told how the three electric systems could be brought down entirely by attacks on select stations. Three parts: The United States energy grid is made up of three systems that only have minimal interactions which means that only nine stations would have to be attacked to shut down the whole system . 'Destroy nine interconnection substations and a transformer manufacturer and the entire United States grid would be down for at least 18 months, probably longer,' wrote FERC's director of external affairs Leonard Tao in a June memo that was only revealed publicly today. Adding to the problem, the solution is not as simple as just protecting these nine stations because there are reportedly 30 stations that meet the necessary criteria but less than a third of them have to be attacked. Experts differ on the number of stations that would fall into said category- with others putting it closer to 100- but it does not diminish their concern. â€˜It is neither a monumental task, nor is it an inordinate sum of money that would be required to do so,â€™ former FERC chairman Jon Wellinghoff said in an email to the Wall Street Journal. At the moment, existing laws focus on security protocols at nuclear power stations as opposed to those that deal with standard electricity. Attacked: Fears were renewed over the safety of electricity plants after an attack on the Metcalf plan in San Jose, California which took place in April 2013 when one or two men attacked 17 towers in less than 20 minutes . Concerned: Senators Dianne Feinstein (left) and Harry Reid (right) were two of the four who are now pushing for an exploration of a security expansion for many electric plants in light of sabotage fears . The stations are owned and operated by private companies, and many of them only have cameras and chain-link fences to fend off attackers. Should the attack focus on only one of the country's three major systems, that wouldn't be much help to those effected, however, because the three systems interact so minimally that it would be very difficult to transfer electricity from one system to another. Concern about attacks on power plants was renewed after a strike on a power station in California in April 2013. One or two gunmen were able to break . into a PG&E station in San Jose, cut the communication lines and . then go on to shoot up  17 transformers in under 20 minutes. They were . able to flee before police arrived because it took so long for any 911 . calls to go out since they had knocked out the fiber optic cables . serving the facility which facilitate phone calls. 'This . wasn't an incident where Billy-Bob and Joe decided, after a few . brewskis, to come in and shoot up a substation,â€™ retired vice president . of transmission for PG&E, Mark Johnson told The Wall Street Journal . in February. Lit up: The Santa Clara Sheriff's Office released this surveillance footage of the attack which shows the gunshots going off on the grounds of the PG&E facility . Sparks flew: No one was injured and the power didn't actually go out in the area because the state grid was able to maintain it but officials fear that it was a test run . 'This was an event that was well thought out, well planned and they targeted certain components.' Power in southern California did not go out after this incident because the state grid operator was able to prevent the fallout, but it did prompt enough concern to make experts fearful. In February, four Democratic Senators sent a letter to federal regulators asking if they needed to install mandatory security standards for power companies to enforce at their plants. Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon, Harry Reid of Nevada, Dianne Feinstein of California and Al Franken of Minnesota wrote that the sabotage was a ""wake-up call to the risk of physical attacks on the grid."" 'This incident came uncomfortably close to causing a shutdown of a critical substation which could have resulted in a massive blackout in California and elsewhere in the West,' they wrote. In December, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman Cheryl LaFleur told Congress grid security is a top priority, and her agency cooperates with utilities to protect physical equipment. Federal cybersecurity standards for protecting the grid are in place and mandated. However, rules for protecting physical sites such as transformers and substations are voluntary.","Federal regulators fear that the three main electricity systems for the U.S. could be entirely wiped out after a small but targeted attack .

A man who became known for claiming he was the sailor kissing a woman in Times Square in a famous World War II-era photo taken by a Life magazine photographer has died aged 86. Glenn McDuffie passed away on March 9 in a nursing home in Dallas, his daughter, Glenda Bell, told The Associated Press. A mail carrier and semi-professional baseball player after he returned from World War II, McDuffie's life became more exciting about six years ago when Houston Police Department forensic artist Lois Gibson was able to identify him as the young man leaning over the woman in his arms to kiss her. Scroll down for video . Iconic: U.S. Navy sailor Glenn Edward McDuffie (left) was 18 at the time of this famed 'kiss' photo taken in Times in August 1945 at the close of World War Two, after the surrender of Japan . Legendary: WWII veteran Glenn McDuffie died in a nursing home on March 9, aged 86 . By taking about 100 pictures of McDuffie using a pillow to pose as he did in the picture taken August 14, 1945, by photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt, Gibson said, she was able to match the muscles, ears and other features of the then-80-year-old McDuffie to the young sailor in the original image. 'I was absolutely positive,' Gibson said of the match. 'It was perfect.' The identification remained controversial, partly because other men also claimed to have been the sailor in the image, but also because Life magazine, whose photographer had died years earlier, was unable to confirm that McDuffie was in fact the sailor, noting Eisenstaedt had never gotten names for those in the picture. Yet for McDuffie, Gibson's word was enough. Contested: Several men came forward claiming they were the sailor in Alfred Eisenstaedt's iconic Life magazine photo, but a forensic artist proved it was Glenn McDuffie (pictured) A . well-respected forensic artist who was in the 2005 Guinness Book of . World Records for helping police identify more suspects than any other . forensic artist, Gibson said McDuffie was ecstatic when she told him the . results he had waited 62 years to hear. And . so began a whirlwind lifestyle of going to air shows, gun shows, . fundraisers and parties to tell his story. Women would pay $10 to take a . picture kissing him on the cheek, Gibson said. 'He would make money and kiss women,' Gibson said. 'He had the most glamorous life of any 80 year old.' Step back in time: Glenn McDuffie reenacted the famous 'Kissing Sailor' shot in Times Square 50 years after it was first snapped in August 1945 . Snapper: German-born American photojournalist, Alfred Eisenstaedt, captured the iconic Times Square kiss on August 14, 1945 . McDuffie had told the AP he was changing trains in New York when he was told that Japan had surrendered. 'I was so happy. I ran out in the street,' said McDuffie, then 18 and on his way to visit his girlfriend in Brooklyn. 'And then I saw that nurse,' he said. 'She saw me hollering and with a big smile on my face. ... I just went right to her and kissed her.' 'We never spoke a word,' he added. 'Afterward, I just went on the subway across the street and went to Brooklyn.' Gibson's daughter, Bell, said on anniversaries of the war's end her father would recall that moment and the air of excitement in Times Square. For years it bothered him that he wasn't identified as the man in the photo, she said, and he turned to Gibson for help to clear it up. 'He wanted to do it before he died,' she said. McDuffie is survived by his daughter and two grandchildren. His funeral will be held March 21 at the Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery.","Glenn McDuffie died on March 9 in a Dallas nursing home .

The President to Israel has revealed how he used to hide his identity when travelling incognito in the 1970s - a fake moustache and a hat. Shimon Peres had to disguise himself to attend peace talks between Israel and Jordan’s King Hussein in the mid-seventies. The 90-year-old leader, then the minister of defence, also wore glasses and a fake full beard to travel to the secret talks without being discovered. President Peres posted this picture with the caption: 'This is the disguise I wore in the mid-seventies when I would go to my meetings with King Hussein. Happy #Purim!', featuring two other disguises he used below it . President Peres posted the image on social media, showing himself in the basic, but clearly effective, disguises which helped him travel to Jordan to advocate peace between the two nations. The post went up on Twitter and Facebook ahead of the Jewish holiday Purim, a celebration which include dressing up in costumes. President Peres also encouraged his Facebook followers to send in their Purim fancy dress, saying ‘I am sure they are much better than mine’. President Peres, born Szymon Perski in Vishnyeva, at the time part of Poland, but now located in Belarus. He immigrated to Israel, then Palestine, in 1934.

It takes professional athletes years of training and thousands of pounds worth of equipment to compete for a medal at the Winter Olympics. But at this skiing event in Afghanistan all you need is enthusiasm and a couple of planks of wood. The annual Afghan Ski Challenge, which takes place in Banyam, near the capital Kabul, is so low-tech there aren't even ski lifts, with competitors forced to hike three miles up a mountain before the event even begins. The fourth annual Afghan Ski Challenge took place in Banyam, near Kabul, at the beginning of March . The race is open to both snowboarders and skiers, many of whom bring their own equipment . The race is free for Afghans who are encouraged to bring their own equipment but 'no weapons' International skiers travel to take part in the race, but they must pay $500 (£300) to enter . Keen amateurs often strap tyre strips to a plank of wood to use as a ski, and compete wearing warm clothing . Dressed in jumpers, scarves and even loafers, the competitors carry their equipment up to roughly 3,400 metres (11,100ft) before skiing back down. There is only one event, a downhill race everyone takes part in at the same time, with the winner being the first to cross the finish line after passing through all the checkpoints on the way down. The race is open to both skiers and snowboarders, with most competitors using whatever they can get their hands on. In recent years, many Afghan nationals have shown their ingenuity by carving themselves skis and poles out of wood, using old planks or fence posts. The slopes are so low-tech that there aren't even chair lifts, with skiers hiking five miles before the race starts . The annual event, in its fourth year, is organised by the Banyam Ski Club . On the club's website they warn that medical facilities are 'basic' and there is no mountain rescue service . Any profit from the event is reinvested in tourism in Afghanistan as the country emerges from conflict . While the keen amateurs may grab the attention with their DIY skis, the event was won by a professional Afghan ski instructor . They then use sandal straps, plastic and strips cut from old tyres to hold their feet in place before racing down the Koh-e-Baba Mountain Range. British photographer Paul Hutchings, 42, who captured these images, said they would still put most people to shame. He said: 'It is absolutely amazing to watch these guys use the most basic items to ski. They use whatever they can get their hands on. 'It is totally different to the Alps and the Rockies. The are no lifts, no chairs, this is raw skiing at its best.' Despite the equipment, photographer Paul Hutchings said the skiers would put most amateurs to shame . The Koh-e-Baba Mountain Range, near to Kabul, where the event takes place, has snow for four months a year . Banyam Ski Club is part owned by skiing enthusiasts from Switzerland who are trying to promote the sport . Participants all race at once and the winner is the one who crosses the finish line first after passing through all of the checkpoints dotted along the route . This year's winner was Ali Shah, an Afghan ski instructor, who finished the 4k run before anyone else . The event, now in its fourth year, featured 15 racers from Afghanistan and 15 international competitors from the USA, Australia, Norway, Slovenia, New Zealand, France and the UK. Foreign competitors must pay $500 (£300) to take part, but for Afghan nationals the competition is free. The challenge was eventually won by Afghan ski instructor Ali Shah - who used modern equipment and was used to the high-altitude conditions. Mr Hutchings, from Cardiff, Wales, added: 'The area is covered in snow for three to four months and because the locals are used to the altitude they are really fit and hardly get tired around the course.' A simple piece of wood serves as a cheap, but not very effective alternative to carbon fibre . Bits of old shoes, spare plastic, foam and tyre rubber are all then used in place of conventional foot straps . Competitors from around the world take part in the race, using slightly more advanced equipment . The event, which takes place in one of the safe Afghan regions, draws a large crowd every year . All money made by the race is put back into promoting the local skiing and tourism in Afghanistan as the country emerges from a decade of war. While Banyam Ski Club, which organises the event, insists the area is safe from fighting, they do point out that the mountains don't have any of the safety feature usually associated with ski resorts. There are no avalanche warning systems, no mobile phone signal, no mountain rescue service, and medical facilities are 'basic', their Facebook page says. They say that the competition is strictly 'no weapons', adding that 'all participants take part solely at their own risk'","Afghan Ski Challenge happens every March in Banyam, near Kabul .

A mother of two from Delaware has been charged with murder after police say she poisoned her husband to death by spiking his steroids with anti-freeze. Jamie Baker, 44, was arrested Thursday on one count each of first-degree murder and possession of a deadly weapon in connection to the September 2013 death of her husband, 42-year-old James Baker II. An autopsy revealed that Mr Baker had ethylene glycol - a chemical found in anti-freeze - in his system, and his death was ruled homicide by poisoning. Admission of guilt: Jamie Baker (left) confessed to detectives that she killed her husband, James Baker II (right) last September by lacing his steroids with anti-freeze . Happier times: Jamie and James Baker, pictured here on their wedding day,  were married for 21 years . Following his passing, police found syringes and liquid steroids in his Smyrna home. According to detectives, he had ordered the supplements through the Internet. Investigators searched the home again Thursday, after which police say the victim's widow admitted that she had used a hypodermic syringe to extract anti-freeze from a bottle and then injected it into her husbandâ€™s liquid steroids. Mrs Baker, who has two young daughters, remained jailed Friday at the Delores Baylor Women's Correctional Institution without bail. On September 16, 2013, Mr Baker was found dead in the master bedroom of his home in the  2000 block of Bryn Zion Road just outside of Smyrna. Officers on the scene recovered pills, syringes, and a box containing several bottles of liquid steroids, the contents of which tested positive for anti-freeze. New evidence: Police discovered that Mr Baker (right), a professional weightlifter, ordered liquid steroids last June; following a search of their house, Mrs Baker came clean about how she poisoned her husband . During the months-long investigation, police were able to determine that Mr Baker had purchased the steroids online in June 2013 and had them shipped to a friendâ€™s house, The Smyrna-Clayton Sun-Times reported. The two men then divided the bottles between themselves, and Baker stashed his share in a locked toolbox in a closet. Police officers returned to the Bakers' home Thursday and executed a second search warrant, which ended in Jamie Baker's arrest following her confession to the crime. The woman did not provide a motive for her actions, according to police. The 42-year-old man was a competitive weightlifter who worked as an environmental specialist at the DuPont Experimental Station. He and Jamie were married for 21 years. Broken home: Mr Baker left behind two young daughters, who will now likely lose their mother as well . On her Facebook page filled with family photos and pictures of her two  daughters, Jamie Baker expertly played the part of the grieving widow. On her late husband's birthday December 6, she wrote a touching status update where she professed her feelings to her 'first and only love' and her 'best friend.' A month later, she posted a prayer in which she wrote in part: 'I miss Jimmy.'","Jamie Baker, 44, charged with first-degree murder in the September 2013 death of her husband, 42-year-old James Baker II .

The best-looking male muses in paintings at the National Portrait Gallery have been uncovered by the infamous Your Barrister Boyfriend blog. The Tumblr page shot to fame last year after ranking the hottest men in law and quickly became the talk of the legal world. Jumping on its success, the blog - which is run by two women -  then revealed the top 21 most attractive women on the legal circuit. Now, its gone a step further by ranking the top 15 'hotties' featured in artworks at the London gallery. The blog is run by writers Sonia van Gilder Cooke and Natalia Naish who describe themselves as ‘utterly frivolous Americans’ living in London. British politician and statesman Joseph Chamberlain is described on the blog as 'the hottest minor British statesman we've ever encountered'. He tops the list of the 'hottest men in National Portrait Gallery', according to the Your Barrister Blog Tumblr blog. Chamberlain made his career as a manufacturer of screws and before becoming a notable Mayor of Birmingham . Sir Joseph Banks comes third in the blog's list and is described as the 'one and only science hottie'. Sir Banks was an English naturalist, botanist and patron of the natural sciences in the 18th Century. At 23, he joined Captain James Cook's first great voyage (1768 - 1771) to explore the uncharted lands of the South Pacific . Samuel Prescod, pictured centre in this picture of the 1840 World's Anti-Slavery Convention, was a leading anti-slavery campaigner from Barbados, where he is now regarded as a national hero. He became the first person of African descent to be elected to Barbados's Parliament in 1843 and also helped found the Liberal Party . Peter Pears places fifth in the blog's National Portrait Gallery 'hotties' list. Tenor Peter Pears was partner to composer Benjamin Britten and the Your Barrister Boyfriend blog describes their romance as 'ideal' and that they seemed 'uniquely devoted to each other' Charles Haslewood Shannon is described by the blog as 'a striking, slender young man with razor-sharp cheekbones and a deliciously haughty look'. The English artist attended the City and Guilds of London Art School and was subsequently considerably influenced by his lifetime partner Charles Ricketts .

Alfred Lord Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, was Poet Laureate of Great Britain and Ireland during much of Queen Victoria's reign. He is described by the Your Barristers Boyfriend blog as having a 'manly yet refined nose, well-formed, succulent lips, pensive eyes and a dignified brow' English statesman Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea PC, was a close ally and confidant of Florence Nightingale. In 1845, he was included in the cabinet as Secretary at War, and again held this office from 1852 to 1855, being responsible for the War Office during the Crimean War, and again in 1859 . Sir John William Alcock, who was a captain in the Royal Air Force, is described on the blog as being a 'true daredevil' and is commended for winning the Distinguished Service Cross in the First World War for attacking three enemy aircraft mid-flight . The Your Barrister Boyfriend Tumblr blog describes painter Duncan Grant as 'another pretty boy with an eventful love life' who has a 'strong, manly jaw and large, dreamy eyes'. Mr Grant eventually set up house with the beautiful, married paintress Vanessa Bell (sister of Virginia Woolf) and her husband, art critic Clive Bell . Australian-born British painter Henry Lamb is noted for his unusual portraits, as exemplified by his well-known picture of Duncan Grant's one-time alleged lover, Lytton Strachey . Poet Ted Hughes is described on the blog's 'hottie' list as an 'old rogue' with a 'craggy brown and rugged jaw'.

One mother said: ‘A number of us noticed that our sons had stopped eating normally. 'When we started to ask why, we were told that they were worried about being too heavy...they thought they might be excluded from the tournament. ‘Some of the boys are just over 50kg but it’s not because they’re fat or unhealthy, they are just well developed. ‘A few boys have started to go on crash diets now because they want to be able to play. The rule has been imposed by Stonyhurst College in Clitheroe and will affect 40 different schools . ‘Children shouldn’t be worrying about . how much they weigh at that age. Personally, I don’t  think boys should . even know  how much they do weigh.’ The . school’s head, Annette Roberts, admitted it was a ‘contentious matter’ but  rejected pressure to pull out  of the tournament, telling  parents . the rule was ‘for  safety purposes only’. Stonyhurst College, which organises the event, said it had imposed weight restrictions for younger players for many years for safety reasons. Simon Charles, director of sport at the leading Catholic school, said: ‘It is to  get rid of the disparity of  earlier maturing pupils who  are considerably larger  than others.’ The National Schools Sevens, the world’s largest competition for the age group, hosted by Rosslyn Park in London, has a weight limit of 65kg (10st 3lb) in its Preparatory Schools section for Under-13s.","Public school Stonyhurst ruled under-11s must weigh less than 7st 11lb .

Sun-worshippers flocked outside in their droves today as temperatures across Britain soared to a balmy 18C (64F) – in what is a stark contrast to this day last year when inches of snow covered much of the United Kingdom. The above average temperatures are a warm welcome for this time of year especially after last spring when the country experienced the coldest March for 50 years. Today, temperatures reached 18.1C (64F) at Heathrow Airport and in Usk, South Wales. It was also a pleasant 17.6C (63F) in St James’s Park, London, and Pershore, Worcestershire.

Weather experts were forced to issue dozens of weather warnings across the country last March as snow, ice, heavy rain and high winds battered Britain. Motorists spent the night in their vehicles in Sussex and Kent after the South East was hit by snow and, in Devon and Cornwall, heavy rain caused severe flooding prompting residents to evacuate their flood-hit homes. However, 12 months on and Britain is continuing to enjoy the first mini-heatwave of the year – which was sparked by the hottest day of the year so far last weekend. The highest temperature of the year so far was recorded as 20.5C (69F) in Gravesend, Kent, on Sunday and Met Office forecasters say the country could see similar temperatures this weekend.

He is Britain’s most brutal inmate with a 40-year history of prison violence. But Charles Bronson was talked down by a petite female officer after he took a governor hostage, The Mail on Sunday can reveal as a 'sinister' painting he sent Reggie Kray is put up for auction. The 20-something guard negotiated with the notorious prisoner to bring the tense, 20-minute stand-off to a peaceable end. The attack at HMP Woodhill, Milton Keynes, on February 28 saw Bronson moved 150 miles into isolation at HMP Wakefield, West Yorkshire. The 5ft officer persuaded Bronson to release his grip on the governor’s throat, before two guards seized the 61-year-old. Charles Bronson sent his painting to Reggie Kray in prison. The painting is now up for auction through auctioneer JP Humbert in Northamptonshire . Charles Bronson (left) gave the painting to Reggie Kray (right). He accompanied the picture with a note which reads: 'To Reg, from your friend Charlie Bronson' ‘Bronson got hold of the duty governor’s neck in a dispute over his mail,’ said a source. ‘It was not looking good.’ Bronson . was jailed for seven years for armed robbery in 1974, but has spent 40 . years behind bars for a series of violent episodes in prison. He got a life sentence in 1999 for taking a teacher hostage and leashing him ‘like a dog’ for two days. This latest incident is being looked  into and could lead to Bronson serving yet more time. The story comes as it was reported the belongings of notorious criminals Reggie and Ronnie Kray will go up for auction next week. Items . going under the hammer will include a well-thumbed bible and wristwatch . - both owned by the twins when they were serving life-sentences for . murder. Ronnie Kray was also convicted of murdering George Cornell in 1966 - he shot Cornell between the eyes at an East End pub. The bible and black Quartz watch were originally owned by Ronnie but passed on to his brother Reggie after his death in 1995. According to . paperwork, the items were all given away by Reggie to an acquaintance in 1999 while he was . serving time at HM Prison Wayland in Norfolk. In his bible, Ronnie had marked up specific passages 'on judgement and damnation'. In the same lot, is another of the twins' belongings, a painting by one of Britain's most well-known prisoners, Charles Bronson. The auctioneer selling the pieces, Jonathan Humbert from auction house JP Humbert's in Northamptonshire, described the painting as 'altogether more sinister'. Bronson, whose real name is Michael . Peterson, is currently serving a life term at HMP Woodhill in Milton . Keynes and has earned public notoriety with a history of violence both . inside and outside jail. With the painting, he included a note which read: 'To Reg, from your friend Charles Bronson'. Both Bronson and Reggie were in prison at the time. Bronson was jailed at Wakefield prison and Reggie in Norfolk. Charles Bronson sent this note to his 'friend' Reggie Kray in prison . A quartz, black-strapped wristwatch belonging to Ronnie Kray while he was in jail serving a life sentence was passed to his twin brother Reggie. Reggie gave the watch to an acquaintance in 1999, according to the accompanying prison documentation . The bible and watch were originally owned by Ronnie Kray but passed on to brother Reggie after Ronnie died in jail in 1995. In the bible owned by Ronnie, specific passages 'on judgement and damnation' were marked up . The seller of the items has remained anonymous but JP Humbert's said that they expect the pieces to fetch hundreds of thousands. Jonathan Humbert, from the auction . house in Towcester, said that the Kings James version Bible, which had belonged to Ronnie, had been organised with three original bookmarks. The marks pick out 'chapters on judgement and damnation', Mr Humbert said. He added: 'For example, the first bookmark is in Psalms 26, where it reads 'Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in mine integrity. 'It goes on: 'examine me, O Lord, and prove me. 'We have not touched them, and we are assured the markers have not been moved by the vendor either.' Reggie Kray, requested for his painting, by Charles Bronson, to be given to an acquaintance. Pictured is the note from Reggie to prison officers . The auctioneer said that he thought the bible would be popular with buyers. He said: 'So you have on one hand an infamous criminal who thought nothing of using violence to mete out his own punishments, but who here has a copy of the Bible and has apparently picked out these passages on judgement and damnation. 'It is in some ways the opposite of what you might expect these guys to have in their possession.' The paperwork accompanying the lots will also go to the winning bidders.

Ronnie died of a heart attack in prison in 1995, while Reggie died of terminal cancer eight weeks after he was granted release on compassionate grounds because of his illness. Mr Humbert said: 'Because we have the prison transfer paperwork from when Reggie gave these items away, the provenance is absolute.

Britain is ready for a gay Prime Minister, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband have claimed. The Lib Dem and Labour leaders said social attitudes had changed dramatically in the last 20 years. Voters would judge a potential prime minister on their ability to lead rather than their sexuality, they said. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg (left) said voters would judge a leader on their ability not their sexuality and Labour leader Ed Miliband said he expects there to be a gay PM . Senior politicians from all parties were challenged over the politics of sexuality as gay marriage became law in England and Wales last night. The first ceremonies are due to take place on March 29. Asked whether the public would accept a gay PM, Mr Clegg told GT magazine: ‘Yes and why not? ‘Being gay doesn't affect how you work, how you interact with people or how you make decisions. I'm confident that the British people would judge him or her on their ability to lead and be a good prime minister and not on who they choose to share their life with.’ Mr Clegg said he hoped in the future children would not dread coming out to their parents. He added: ‘I would have no issues at all if one of my boys told me that he liked another boy. ‘It's not a choice, it's who you are and I would love my boys regardless of their sexuality. ‘I just hope that some day coming out to your parents is not going to be something you dread but something you will remember fondly.’ Mr Miliband said he expects there to be a gay PM in the future as social attitudes have driven a series of changes, including equal marriage, in the last 20 years. British Prime Minister David Cameron said the Government was attempting to fight prejudice where it remains . The Labour leader said: ‘Yes. I think the world has changed a lot. ‘If you think about the way the world has changed in the last 20 years since I was at college we've seen the repeal of Section 28, we've seen civil partnerships, the lowering of the age of consent, equal marriage and that has been driven by change in social attitudes and that is why I think absolutely it's foreseeable to have a gay prime minister. ‘The most important thing to me is that my kids are happy and I don't care whether they're gay or straight. That's what matters to me.’ To date there have been no openly gay leaders of any of the main political parties in Westminster. Ruth Davidson, Tory leader in Scotland, is the first out female leader of a major party in the UK. Prime Minister David Cameron said ‘sexual orientation should be neither here nor there’ as people are helped to achieve their full potential - including becoming PM. He added that more role models - either straight or gay - were needed to encourage best behaviour in sport, adding clubs ‘must tackle problems on the terraces’. In an open letter, Mr Cameron said he was proud to be PM of a country judged to be the ‘best place to live in Europe if you are lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans(gender)’, adding the Government was attempting to fight prejudice where it remains. On sport, the Conservative went on: ‘We are working to break down barriers in sport, too. People should be able to excel in sport regardless of their sexuality - but we know how hard it's been. ‘We have seen the enormously positive reaction to people like Thomas Hitzlsperger and Gareth Thomas being open about their sexuality, and hopefully that will encourage others to be more open too. ‘But we need more role models, straight and gay, to encourage the best behaviour and clubs must tackle problems on the terraces.’","Lib Dem Nick Clegg says being gay doesn't affect how you work .

The elephant, which locals say has killed people in the past and has wrecked more than a dozen houses, rampaged through the house at night when the family was inside. (Stock picture) An elephant rampaged through a village in West Bengal destroying a house. Then it returned to help a child trapped under rubble, witnesses said . It started to move away from the rubble, but hearing a baby girl's cries it returned, the family said. The jumbo then 'carefully' removed with its trunk the wreckage that had fallen on the 10-month-old child and headed back to the forest. The girl's mother said the incident was a miracle. 'We . worship Lord Ganesh (the elephant god) in our village. Still, I can't . believe that the tusker saved my daughter after breaking down the door . and smashing a wall,' Lalita Mahato said. 'We watched amazed as it gently removed the debris that had fallen on her. It's a miracle.'

The incident took place in Purulia district of the east Indian state of West Bengal, a region where man-animal confrontation is a regular phenomenon . 'The tusker started moving away but when our child started crying again, it returned and used its trunk to remove the debris.' The girl suffered some external injuries from the debris but is in a stable condition, doctors said. According to the region's forest officials, the  rampage was quite 'surprising' because it had killed three people in the last one year. 'What's really surprising is that this elephant left the little girl alive even after damaging the house. It seems to have a heart, too,' forest ranger Samir Bose said. Man-elephant confrontations have been on the rise in the region since changes in land use patterns blocked the traditional migration routes of the animals.

Alcopops, which fuelled binge drinking for a generation, are in terminal decline and could disappear within a few years, the government claims. Drinkers who were once drawn to sweet, garish drinks like Hooch, Two Dogs and WKD have switched to more sophisticated alternatives. But sales in alcopops which boomed in the 1990s and early 2000s have slumped by 78 per cent in the last decade, according to official figures. Scroll down for video . Alcopops are now in terminal decline and the market could disappear altogether, the government claims . The generation of 18-30-year-olds who . were first wooed by alcopops have grown up and moved on to wines and . real ales, while the next generation prefer premium tipples like spirit . beers and flavoured ciders. The . market in pre-mixed alcoholic drinks, dominated by alcopops, is now . said to be worth barely half the £1billion value seen in 2005. A total of 105,194 hectolitres of alcopops were sold in 2002, but last year it fell to just 22,942 HL. The slump has now prompted health minister Earl Howe to predict pubs and off licences will call time on the alcopops altogether. ‘Sales . of alcopops are in marked decline, to such an extent that the market . for these products looks like disappearing in the next few years,’ he . said. ‘It is always a concern if people are putting their health at risk by drinking too much alcohol or consuming too much sugar.' At their peak in 2002, alcopops accounted for 12 per cent of all the alcohol units consumed by women in the UK but by 2009 it had fallen to just 4 per cent . He had been challenged in the Lords by . Labour peer Lord Turnberg, who warned high-sugar alcopops ‘contain more . than 170 calories a bottle - about the same as a sweetened chocolate . milk drink - as well as the alcohol’. But . Earl Howe insisted: ‘One should not always assume that an alcopop is a . high-calorie drink. For example, ready-mixed gin and tonic is . technically an alcopop, but very often low-calorie tonic goes into it.’ Supermarkets . are coming under pressure to add calorie counts to their own brand . alcohol, in an attempt to encourage drinkers – particularly women – to . curb their drinking. The drop in alcopop sales is blamed I part on shifting social attitudes. According to the Office for National Statistics, women over 65 drink more often than their younger counterparts. A generation which become hooked on alcopops has grown up and moved on to more sophisticated alternatives . Some 14 per cent of seven female pensioners consume alcohol at least five days a week compared with just 2 per cent for those aged from 16 to 24. There has been a sharp decline in the role alcpopos play in the nation's drinking. At their peak in 2002, alcopops accounted for 12 per cent of all the alcohol units consumed by women in the UK. But by 2009 it had fallen to just 4 per cent. In 2012, just 2 per cent of drinkers said they drank alcopops on their heaviest drinking day of the last week, compared to 46 per cent who said wine and champagne, 22 per cent who downed spirits and 39 per cent who drank beer, lager and cider. Alcopops were most likely to have been drunk by 16-24 year old women (11 per cent) but this dropped to just 2 per cent of 25-44 year old women. Retail analyst Mintel said sales at off licences are down 12 per cent year-on-year. Chris . Wisson, senior drinks analyst at Mintel, said: ‘The long-term decline . of the alcopops market shows no sign of slowing just yet. ‘One . of the main initial causes for the downturn was the image problem as . alcopops were targeted as one of the drinks causing social issues such . as binge drinking. ‘The name 'alcopops' itself was a problem and has strong connotations with being an immature and unsophisticated drink.’ ‘The . strong popularity of newer categories such as spirit beers and . flavoured ciders with these younger drinkers partly owes to their . sweeter tastes,’ Mr Wisson added. ‘But . these drinks have also wisely focused on sophistication and a premium . image, making these often image-conscious consumers want to be seen . drinking them.’ 11 per cent of 16-24-year-old women said they drank alcopops on their heaviest day of drinking in the last week, according to the ONS . Emily Robinson, Director of Campaigns at Alcohol Concern said: 'We have always believed that alcopops of the 1990s was a cynical attempt to recruit younger drinkers; especially at a time when the industry saw that they weren’t getting the normal flow of drinkers coming through. 'Though the alcopop is no longer as dominant we can still see it’s lasting impact on the market today with drinks such as fruit flavoured ciders and ready mixed cocktails being brought in. 'It also shouldn’t be forgotten that the alcopop Hooch has recently made a comeback. 'Alcopops were also particularly marketed towards young women in particular, who are now drinking at historically high levels. 'Today wine and spirits make up 73 per cent of alcohol consumed each week by women and between 2002-2010 female alcohol-related hospital admissions amongst this age group increased by 76 per cent.'","Products which fuelled a generation of binge drinkers in terminal decline .

An overweight cat survived being shot at with an airgun after the pellet became lodged in his rolls of fat, missing his vital organs by just inches. Vikki Starkess, from Sleaford, Lincolnshire, found her pet cat Kahn, who weighs 1 stone 2lbs, in a distressed state when she arrived home from work last month. The rescue cat was licking and washing himself uncontrollably and when Miss Starkess, 32, inspected him she discovered a small round bullet wound in his fur - caused by an airgun. A Lincolnshire cat survived after being shot at with a gun pellet after the bullet became lodged in his rolls of fat. Owner Vikki Starkess, said that the fact that her cat Kahn was 'a bit fat' saved his life . She rushed the cat for emergency surgery, costing £450, but vets were baffled when they failed to find the pellet despite cutting through his stomach and searching through his intestines in case it had caused internal bleeding. The mystery was eventually solved when they discovered the pellet lodged in the cat's rolls of fat. They were even more astonished when they realised the fat had prevented the metal pellet reaching his internal organs - thus potentially saving his life. Miss Starkess, whose fiance is called Gavin Hoare, said: 'The vets had to cut him open into his . abdomen - they thought it could be in his intestine or liver - they . ended up cutting open his stomach from top to bottom. 'It’s lucky he loves his food - the fact that he’s a bit fat saved his life.' Vets are now hoping the pellet stays lodged in the piece of fat so that the risk of lead poisoning remains 'minimal'. But Miss Starkess was left with no choice but to dip into money that she had saved for her wedding to fund Kahn's surgery. Describing the ordeal on February 22, she said: 'Kahn was acting funny, he was licking and washing uncontrollably - there was no blood but he was skulking up the stairs - I knew something was wrong. An x-ray carried out by vets showed a bullet lodged inside Kahn's upper body . 'I looked him over and found a perfectly round hole, I rushed him to the vets immediately, I was terrified.' Kahn is still being monitored by vets to make sure that he does not develop lead poisoning. Miss Starkess said: 'It makes me feel sick right down to my stomach that someone could harm an animal like that. 'If your animal gets hit by a car or natural disease it is heart-breaking, but it is life. You don’t expect someone to shoot your cat. 'It is just pure evil.' Miss Starkess said that the actions of the thugs who targeted Kahn were 'pure evil'. She urged other owners to check their cats for small pellet wounds if their animal becomes unwell . She now hopes that other owners in the area will stay vigilant and check their pets for small pellet wounds if they become unwell. Miss Starkess said: 'If you say a cat has been shot you expect a big bullet wound and pouring blood, but it just isn’t. If it is left too late there is nothing they can do. 'It goes in and sits there, and potentially they can end up with lead poisoning. 'We have been very lucky with Kahn, and hopefully he will go on to make a full recovery. ' Miss Starkess is urging other owners to check their cats for 'small pellet wounds'. She said: 'If you say a cat has been shot you expect a big bullet wound and pouring blood, but it just isn't.

Energy tariffs are so complicated that two in three customers have no idea how to identify the cheapest deal, according to a damning new study. The complex combination of standing charges, kilowatt hours and unit prices leaves most of us baffled. The ‘big six’ energy firms have been told by industry regulator Ofgem to cut the number of tariffs and deals to help families find the best value. A damning new report has shown that two in three people are baffled by energy prices, confused by a combination of standing charges, unit prices and kilowatt hours . Despite these changes most people are still in the dark when it comes to deciphering how much they will be charged a year, according to research by consumer champion Which?. The group provided details of the standard tariff charged by the big six – British Gas, SSE, EDF, E.ON, Npower, and Scottish Power – to just over 500 people. Only a third – 35per cent – managed to pick the cheapest deal when tariffs were presented in line with the structure put forward under Ofgem’s Retail Market Review (RMR). This requires firms to list a unit rate and standing charge. Of the rest, three in ten – 31per cent - picked the wrong tariff and a third – 34per cent - either did not think it was possible or did not know how. Four in ten – 41per cent - used an aid to do their calculations such as a calculator or spread sheet, yet only half of these people got it right. As well as changing the structure of tariffs, Ofgem is also introducing a new system spelling out how they should be presented to customers under the so-called Tariff Comparison Rate(TCR). This displays the tariff on the basis of what a medium energy user would pay for their gas and electricity. While useful, it does not help someone who is a very low user or a very high user to find the cheapest deal. The Which? research found that  only 8per cent found the TCR display easy to understand. When people were asked to pick the cheapest deal for a very low-energy user using the TCR figures, nearly two thirds – 64per cent – got it wrong. The ¿big six¿ energy firms  - British Gas, SSE, EDF, E.ON, Npower, and Scottish Power - have been told by industry regulator Ofgem to cut the number of tariffs and deals to help families find the best value . Which? has been campaigning for a system that does away with the standing charge and applies a simple unit rate for gas and electricity. Its research shows eight in ten – 81per cent – were able to pick the cheapest deal when they were presented with the tariffs in this simple format. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘In spite of Ofgem’s tariff reforms to simplify the market, consumers are still failing to spot the cheapest deal because energy pricing remains too complicated. ‘More radical changes are needed to fix the broken energy market. That’s why our Fix the Big Six campaign is also calling for a full competition inquiry, so that hard-pressed consumers can be confident that the market works well for them as well as shareholders, and that the price they pay is fair.’ The last time Which? carried out a survey of whether customers could understand bills in 2012, just 8per cent managed to find the cheapest option. The increase to 35per cent this time is an improvement, but the majority still struggle to negotiate the maze of figures . The industry’s trade body, Energy UK said: ‘Energy companies have made great changes helping customers find the best deal available. We are pleased the survey results show an increase in customer understanding and the energy industry is continuing to work with customers and consumer groups so more people understand their bills and choices. ‘Already tariffs have been radically streamlined making it much easier for customers to understand bills and compare deals. Most recent figures show that around 1.3 million customers switched in the last quarter of 2013 alone. This is a welcome sign we are moving in the right direction and that the process is easy to follow and the energy industry is increasingly competitive with plenty of suppliers to choose from.’ A spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Climate change said: . 'Last year the Government backed Ofgem’s reforms to make the retail market clearer and more transparent. Simplifying the structure of energy tariffs is just one of the many reforms that are being introduced to give power back to consumers and make switching easier. 'The simplified tariffs and the new energy bills format combined with the introduction of QR codes will enable consumers to choose the cheapest tariff and have a more accurate understanding of the potential savings on offer to them. 'Someone switching from the worst deal on the market at the moment to the best online deal could save around £200 on a dual fuel bill with 248,000 people making the switch last February and 42 per cent moving away from the bigger energy suppliers.' Simon McCulloch, Head of Insurance for price comparison website comparethemarket.com said: 'It's clear from Which?'s survey that, despite steps forward in making costs more transparent, energy prices continue to be frustratingly opaque for many consumers. 'The fact that the majority of people cannot locate the best deal for them is a glaring indication that clarity needs to be improved. Energy bills are an area where many families, unknown to them, significantly overpay and it's feasible for a family to save £300-400 per year - in some cases more - simply by shopping around and switching. 'For an elderly person that sum could equate to paying for 3-4 months of groceries or for a young family that could be the difference between whether they can afford to run a car or not,' he added. Energy . price tariffs are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers . constantly battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd consumers can take advantage of . this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to . ensure they are on THE cheapest deal. Even moving every other year will . save you significant amounts. Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. If you are one of the millions of . people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original . supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big chunk of cash, possibly . as much as £300 a year. Prices . are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you . will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff . that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison to find the best price.","Damning new report says complex combination of standing charges, kilowatt hours and unit prices leave most baffled .

House prices in England and Wales have reached an all-time record high of nearly £260,000, almost ten times higher than the average full-time worker’s salary, a report reveals today. While their salary is £27,000, the price tag of the average home is £257,951, a widening gulf which is freezing a generation of young people off the property ladder. For many parents, they are living in homes bought decades ago and now worth a fortune, but their grown-up children cannot afford to buy without help from the ‘Bank of Mum and Dad.’ House prices in England and Wales have reached an all-time record high of nearly £260,000, almost ten times higher than the average full-time worker's salary, a report reveals today . The figures, from LSL Property Services, the estate agency giant, come as mortgage lending has risen to its highest level since the credit crunch struck seven years ago. The Council of Mortgage Lenders said the number of loans handed out in January to buy a home was 48,600, the largest number in the month of January since 2007. David Newnes, a director of LSL, which owns Reeds Rains and Your Move estate agents, said: ‘The housing market is firing on all cylinders. ‘2013 may have been the year when the market got back on its feet, but it seems to be this year when we’ll see it gallop onwards towards full health.’ In February last year, the average house price in England and Wales was £243,444. One year later, it has risen by £14,507 to a new record of £257,951. The booming housing market comes amid concerns about the Government’s decision to intervene with the launch of its two Help to Buy schemes. Both schemes help people to buy homes for up to £600,000 if they have only a small deposit of only five per cent of the property’s value. The figures, from LSL Property Services, the estate agency giant, come as mortgage lending has risen to its highest level since the credit crunch struck seven years ago . Lord McFall, a leading Labour peer and former chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, said Help to Buy should be re-named ‘Help to Vote’. Speaking at a conference at the think-tank Policy Exchange, he said the schemes ‘definitely need to be withdrawn because we don’t need to see a further surge in house prices.’ But the schemes are clearly boosting the chances of young people getting onto the housing ladder. Mortgage lending to first-time buyers jumped by nearly 40 per cent over the last year. In January last year, 15,800 first-time buyers got a loan, compared to 21,800 in January this year. Paul Smee, director general of the CML, said: ‘All parts of the market are open for business.’ The CML’s figures also show nearly nine in ten people who are taking out a mortgage are opting for a fixed-rate deal. In the past, it was a decision made by less than half of borrowers. It is a sign of people’s growing anxiety about interest rates after the Bank of England has repeatedly made signalled that rates will inevitably go up. It has been five years since the central bank halved the base rate to 0.5 per cent, the lowest level in its 320-year history. The Bank’s deputy governor Charlie Bean said this week the first increase could take place in the spring, and that rates will probably rise to ‘a two to three per cent range’ over the next few years.","While their salary is £27,000, the price tag of the average home is £257,951 .

Labour and the Liberal Democrats have quietly aligned policy pledges in more than a dozen areas, prompting speculation that they are preparing the ground for a coalition after next year’s general election. Ed Miliband’s decision this week to effectively rule out a referendum on the EU if he becomes prime minister was the latest in a series of moves which bring the two parties more closely into line. While Tory strategists admit they struggle to envisage reaching agreement on plans for another five years of power-sharing with the Lib Dems, Labour now agrees with Nick Clegg’s party on a broad range of issues. Ed Miliband's decision this week to effectively rule out a referendum on the EU if he becomes prime minister was the latest in a series of moves which bring the two parties more closely into line . An analysis by the New Statesman identifies 14 areas where Labour and the Lib Dems have converged, including cutting pensioner benefits, reducing the voting age to 16 and a mansion tax on expensive homes. Others are preserving the Human Rights Act, introducing new green energy targets and restricting the ability of free schools to hire  whoever they want. Senior Labour figures are split over whether to prepare for the possibility of a pact – something Gordon Brown’s government failed to do in 2010, making it easier for the Lib Dems to reach an agreement with the Conservatives. Lord Adonis, the shadow minister for infrastructure, has called publicly for the party to start planning for a deal, but Harriet Harman, the deputy leader, has dismissed such calls, suggesting it could prevent some Lib Dem voters  from switching to Labour. Some of those closest to Mr Miliband are also urging him to attempt a minority government if Labour is the largest party but falls short of a Commons majority next year, rather than entering a coalition with the Lib Dems. However, the increasing overlap between the two parties’ policies has prompted suspicions  in Tory ranks that they are increasingly contemplating a power-sharing pact. This week, the Labour leader announced he would only support an EU referendum following any new transfer of powers from Britain to Brussels, something no one is contemplating and effectively ruling it out – a stance identical to that of the Lib Dems. Lord Adonis, the shadow minister for infrastructure, has called publicly for the party to start planning for a deal, but Harriet Harman, the deputy leader, has dismissed such calls, suggesting it could prevent some Lib Dem voters from switching to Labour . ‘After thrashing about for months on what to do about an EU referendum, Miliband happens to settle on what’s already Lib Dem policy,’ said one senior Conservative. ‘They’re suddenly agreeing too on mansion taxes and all sorts of other things. It’s fairly obvious what is going on.’ However, there are doubts over whether Mr Clegg could credibly play a role in a Lib-Lab coalition.  Some senior Labour figures  suggest they would seek the departure of the Deputy Prime Minister as the price of a deal. The Lib Dems insisted Mr Brown would have to quit when they discussed the possibility of a Lib-Lab deal in 2010. Mr Clegg, standing in for David Cameron at Prime Minister’s Questions this week, clashed angrily with Labour MPs over a range of issues. He berated Labour for making ‘sweetheart deals with the private sector’ in the NHS and for presiding over the Mid-Staffs hospital scandal, and for ‘sucking up’ to bankers. Labour MPs, meanwhile, attacked him as a ‘lap dog’ of the Conservatives. The Deputy Prime Minister insisted yesterday that Labour’s backing for the Lib Dem position on an in/out EU referendum did not have ‘any bearing’ on a potential coalition deal. ‘Labour have had different positions [on a referendum], and have now said they believe something we’ve been saying for years,’ Mr Clegg told LBC Radio. ‘The Labour party is perfectly entitled to that view, all I’m saying is that they’ve arrived at it rather late in the day.’","Labour and Liberal Democrats have aligned policy pledges in dozen areas .

All children should start the school year with an A grade and should never be told they have failed, according to a controversial guide for teachers. Pupils should be awarded the top grade automatically and told to work to maintain it, the influential Royal Society of Arts says. The charity claims teachers should harness the motivating power of ‘loss aversion’. All pupils should be given an A in a particular subject and must continuously improve to keep it. ‘Consider having each pupil start with an A or a number of gold stars, with points or stars docked when appropriate,’ the guide says. The researchers said the approach would not necessarily mean that students ended up with As. The guidance includes the alternative idea of giving children grade targets to achieve, but instead of telling those who are struggling that they have an F grade – a ‘fail’ – encourage them with ‘not yet’ grades that show they can still reach their goal. The RSA, which was founded in 1754 and includes worldwide web inventor Tim Berners-Lee and former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey as fellows, publishes an alternative curriculum that is followed by more than 200 schools, many of them  state academies. But Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘It is far better to have an  honest starting point than to have  a fake or fraudulent starting point – it’s ludicrous. ‘Children need to start from the beginning and not from the end. They need to aspire to an A grade. They shouldn’t start at the finish line. It’s ridiculous.’ Mr McGovern, a former prep school headmaster, added: ‘Children learn from failure. We all learn from failure. Children have to be told they can fail and not be constantly praised. Critics claim the move is deceptive and patronising to students who should be treated with honesty . ‘Children want teachers to be honest and frank with them – it is only silly educationists who have these ideas about failure.’ Further ideas in the guide include giving pupils views of nature or potted plants to reduce aggression. Teachers are also urged to ‘prime’ pupils by asking them to write an ‘A’ on exam papers before they start writing to boost their performance. The RSA’s latest guide was produced by its Social Brain Centre. The charity is an influential forum for thinkers across a range of topics and has 27,000 members. It calls itself an ‘enlightenment organisation’, dedicated to finding ‘innovative practical solutions to today’s social challenges’.","Influential Royal Society of Arts says motivating move would boost grades .

Tories expressed astonishment that Duncan Weldon, a former adviser to  Harriet Harman and senior economist at the Trades Union Congress, had secured the plum job on Newsnight . The BBC ignited a new row over Left-wing bias last night by appointing a former Labour adviser with barely any journalistic experience as economics editor of its flagship TV news programme. Tories expressed astonishment that Duncan Weldon, a former adviser to Harriet Harman and senior economist at the Trades Union Congress, had secured the plum job on Newsnight. They said it did little to dispel the impression that there is ‘a revolving door’ between the Left and the BBC. Other recent controversial appointments include the recruitment of Ian Katz, a former executive on The Guardian, as Newsnight’s editor and of the former Labour Cabinet minister James Purnell as director of strategy and digital on a salary of £295,000 a year. Former BBC economics correspondent Stephanie Flanders dated both Ed Miliband and Ed Balls. A Tory source said: ‘Arthur Scargill or Len McCluskey would have been a more objective appointment. This is a grade A BBC stitch-up.’ In his role at the TUC, Mr Weldon has regularly defended the economic record of the previous Labour government and attacked the Coalition. But he appears to have hardly any journalistic experience. Gillian Tett, of the Financial Times, and Ed Conway, Sky News’s economics editor, had been tipped for the Newsnight job following the departure of Paul Mason. Mr Weldon himself appeared to acknowledge his lack of credentials for the post with a jokey comment on Twitter in December: ‘Just read the Newsnight economics editor job ad. Does the odd comment piece count me as being an “established economics journalist”?’ He was senior economic adviser to Miss Harman when she was Labour’s acting leader, and predicted that Conservative economic policy ‘would lead to an economic disaster’. Positions held by Newsnight's new man, Duncan Weldon . But last night Mr Katz said he was ‘delighted’ that Mr Weldon, one of ‘the most exciting and original economic thinkers around’, was to join the programme. Mr Katz said Mr Weldon had been ‘the strongest candidate from a very competitive field’, adding: ‘Are you suggesting we should not have hired the strongest candidate?’ Toby Young, a Tory-supporting writer and broadcaster, said: ‘You’ve got to admire Ian Katz’s total disregard for keeping up the appearance of impartiality.’ Weldon was senior economic adviser to Miss Harman when she was Labour's acting leader, and predicted that Conservative economic policy 'would lead to an economic disaster' Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has written to the BBC’s head of news, James Harding, to raise questions about the appointment – saying it even appeared that Mr Weldon had run as a Labour candidate in local elections in 2010. ‘He follows in a long line of economics correspondents who have had clear links either to the Labour Party or Left-wing politics,’ he said. Mr Bridgen said Mr Weldon had spent much of his career ‘campaigning against the Conservative Party’ and criticised his lack of journalistic experience. ‘It seems his only qualification to report on economics for the BBC is that he is Left-wing,’ the MP added. ‘This appointment confirms what [Today programme presenter] John Humphrys hinted at earlier this week, that Left-wing bias is endemic at the BBC.’ Tories also raised concerns about the appointment of Mr Purnell last year, though he ended his party membership on taking up the post. But broadcaster Iain Dale, a former Tory parliamentary candidate, denied that Mr Weldon is ‘a prisoner of the Left’. The appointment will be seen as particularly provocative with a general election – at which the economy will be the central issue – little more than a year away. A BBC spokesman said:  ‘Duncan’s economic commentary is widely respected on all sides of the political spectrum as fair and intelligent. BBC journalists do not bring political views to work and Duncan will be no different.’","Labour adviser Duncan Weldon has barely any journalistic experience .

Star jockey Ruby Walsh (above) has received death threats after he played down the death of a horse during a race. Above, Walsh on Faugheen celebrates victory in the Neptune Investment Management Novices' Hurdle during Ladies Day at Cheltenham on Wednesday . Animal rights campaigners have accused the 34-year-old Irishman of being callous, while others have bombarded him with threats. One tweeted: ‘Ruby Walsh I hope you get your skull crushed by one of the horses you’re so heartlessly flippant about. Animals should not die for sport.’ Another added: ‘Shame more jockeys aren’t killed instead of beautiful horses!!!!!! All jockeys are complete c**ts!! No horse is replaceable!’ Ruby Walsh created controversy when he said that animals are replaceable after Our Conor suffered a fatal fall at Cheltenham on the first day of racing. Above, Our Conor (right) ridden by jockey Daniel Mullins . While another wrote: ‘@Ruby Walsh Don’t worry if you die in a race, there’ll be someone to replace you too.’ On Wednesday, the Mail reported how Ruby Walsh, who has twice won the Grand National, said that there is a difference between the death of a human and a horse. He said: ‘It’s sad, but horses are animals, outside your back door. Humans are humans. They are inside your back door. ‘You can replace a horse. You can’t replace a human being. That’s my feeling on it.’ Dene Stansall of campaign group Animal Aid told the Mail: ‘He has shown callousness for the animals that have earned him a good living. ‘It’s completely disrespectful. To treat the death of a horse in such a way shows that they are merely machines for people to make money. ‘Ruby Walsh is the leading jockey at Cheltenham and wants to support the event as much as he can, but you cannot disregard the lives of horses just because they are not humans. ‘We would expect more from him. This shows he has got little empathy for a horse that really suffered before it died.’ 'Lacking respect': Ruby Walsh, seen after taking a record sixth Mares' Hurdle title at the Cheltenham Festival on Tuesday, has been attacked by animal rights activists . Ingrid Newkirk, founder of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), said: ‘Walsh’s comments expose the true emotion behind horseracing: greed. They are deeply offensive to anyone who has ever loved and lost a horse or other beloved animal companion. ‘Unlike Walsh, horses are not unfeeling but experience joy, anxiety, fear and affection, just as human beings do.’ Mr Walsh last night declined to comment on the threats against him. He told the Mail: ‘I didn’t even know about it.’ Dozens of messages criticising Walsh have been sent directly to his Twitter account. One user, with the profile name Amy, wrote: ‘Do you hate horses because you are so short and this makes you angry?’ Another posted: ‘YOUR (sic) AN IDIOT!! ‘A horse can be replaced’ really??? So can jockeys so I hope you fall off a horse & get trampled!’ Since the furore, Mr Walsh’s father, trainer Ted Walsh, has compared Britain’s attitude on the issue to that in Ireland. He said of the UK: ‘It’s a funny country. They can remember the names of horses that got blown up by the bombs in London but not the names of the people riding them.’ The British Horseracing Association has stressed that the welfare of horses is ‘paramount’ at races such as Cheltenham. A spokesman said: ‘Cheltenham Racecourse employs eight veterinary surgeons, whose sole responsibility it is to provide care to the horses throughout their time at the racecourse. ‘In the event of an incident on the racecourse, any horse affected will receive immediate attention and treatment from the racecourse’s veterinary team. ‘Qualified paramedics and doctors are also on hand in the case of any incident involving a jockey. ‘If necessary, horses and riders will be transported from the course to receive further treatment at the most appropriate equine hospital or Accident & Emergency hospital. ‘British Racing is open and transparent about the risks involved in the sport - the BHA Veterinary team monitors injury rates at every licensed racecourse. Over the last 15 years, the equine fatality rate has fallen by one third to 0.2 per cent of all runners. ‘Despite the best efforts of all involved, as with participation in any sport involving speed and athleticism, there remains an inherent risk of injury.’","Ruby Walsh created controversy when he .

MPs have overwhelmingly voted for the controversial badger call to be abandoned in favour of vaccination. The backbench vote, of 219 to 1, has no direct consequences, but campaign groups described it as a ‘disaster’ for the Government. They said it leaves the Coalition with no alternative but to hold an full vote before deciding whether to extend the cull. All in favour: MPs voted 219 to 1 in favour of the controversial badger cull which activists blast as a 'disaster' The pilot scheme, which began last autumn, aimed to control the spread of bovine TB by killing at least 70 per cent of the badgers in  zones in west Somerset and West Gloucestershire. But the latest as yet unpublished figures, compiled by an independent expert panel appointed by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, show that both areas failed to reach these targets. Plus, up to 18 per cent of the animals took longer than five minutes to die – many more than the 5 per cent figure for the cull to be judged humane, the Commons heard. Conservative MP Anne Main, who tabled the motion to abandon the cull, said that while she acknowledges the ‘hardship and heartache’ TB causes farmers, the independent commission’s conclusions are ‘damning’. The vote comes two years after Brian May launched his protest against wiping out 70 per cent of badgers . Environment Minister George Eustice acknowledged that the cull could be improved but said that vaccines are ‘still far from fully effective’. He added: ‘I know this is a sentimental issue for many people... all I would say I hope MPs can develop some perspective because the reality is shooting is used as a means of controlling foxes and all sorts of other wildlife.’ But charities said the Government must now ditch any plans to extend the cull. Dominic Dyer, of charities the Badger Trust and Care for the Wild, said: ‘This is a huge disaster for the badger cull policy.’","MPs voted 219 to 1 in favour of ending controversial policy to cull badgers .

Hundreds of thousands of savers who have built up small pension pots are to receive a major boost from George Osborne in next week’s Budget. The Chancellor will relax rules to enable retirees with modest nest eggs to take them as cash lump sums, the Mail has learned. The move would help those who are currently forced to turn small savings into a regular income known as an annuity when they stop work. Savers: Those with less than £15,000 in their pension pots will be able to convert the amount into cash . Mr Osborne’s reforms are expected to benefit up to 150,000 savers a year who have built up pension pots of less than £15,000, usually having been in a job for only a few years. Many get a poor deal when they are forced to use it to buy an annuity – a form of insurance – even if it only pays out a few pounds a week. Change: It is understood the rules will be introduced by the Chancellor George Osborne . They also have little choice when they try to shop around for a better deal, since many insurers will not accept savings so small. The Chancellor’s Budget reform, to allow people to convert such pension pots into cash, is a victory for the Daily Mail’s ‘Stop the Great Pensions Rip-off’ campaign which called for the change. The move is also a response to repeated Labour attacks on the £12billion-a-year annuity industry, which has been criticised for a lack of clarity on charges to consumers. Under existing rules, only those approaching retirement with less than £18,000 in total pension savings can avoid buying an annuity and take their fund as cash instead. But many workers have had several employers, and built up pension savings from each job – which when added together take them over  the threshold. A third of the 335,000 annuity sales last year were for sums of less than £10,000, though they are usually unable to secure similar value to those who have saved more. A recent analysis by City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority found that individuals with pension pots in the range of £50,000 to £100,000 could buy pensions worth as much as 50 pence per pound more than those with a pot of £5,000 or less. A 65-year-old with a nest  egg of £5,000, for example, would receive a retirement income of just  £5 per week. The FCA has expressed concern that small pensions savers are being placed at risk by the requirement to use their savings to buy an annuity. Floored: Many savers who were only in a job for a few years get a poor deal on their pension . Those who have small sums dotted around among previous employers will also pay duplicate charges if they have to buy an annuity. The Chancellor’s measure will allow ordinary workers to access small pension pots directly and make their own choices about how they invest it or spend it, rather than handing control over to annuity salespeople. Tom McPhail, a pensions expert at financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘It is very hard for investors with such small pots to get good value from their pension fund.’ The Association of British Insurers, which represents the country’s leading pension providers, has also said it supports reform. Other key expected moves in next week’s statement include an attempt to underline Tory claims to be the true ‘workers’ party’ with another increase in the personal tax allowance, cutting tax bills for millions by at least £100 a year, and further cuts to the welfare budget. The Chancellor is also poised to extend emergency tax breaks offered to small and medium-sized businesses that were introduced by the Coalition during the recession as a means of kick-starting Britain’s ailing economy. COMMENTARY BY JAMES CONEY, MONEY MAIL EDITOR . Turning a pension into an income for life using an annuity can seem desperately poor value at the best of times. But for anyone with a pot of less than £15,000 the returns can be rotten. A 65-year-old with £10,000 of savings would get an income of just £7.50 a week. And pound for pound these small savers are worse off than those who convert bigger pensions into  an annuity. Of the 353,000 pensions turned in to an income last year, 100,700 were by people who had savings of less than £10,000. They shouldn’t have to. Many retiring workers today have had several . employers, and been left with scraps of pensions from all these . different jobs. In some . cases they’ve got two from the same company, after a final salary scheme . was shut down and replaced with one linked to the stock market. Anyone with a pot this small ought to be allowed to have their money back as cash. A lump sum could help them pay off a debt, make home improvements, or bolster their other savings – an annuity of £7 a week is going to make little or no difference to their lifestyle. It just lines the pockets of insurers a little bit more. The reason so many take an annuity they don’t want is because they are hampered by antiquated pension rules. Now, the Chancellor looks set to offer them help. This Government has been accused of fiddling too much with pensions – but this is the kind of tinkering that is necessary and welcomed. A particular problem has been the changing face of Britain’s workforce and the retirement schemes employees are offered. Many retiring workers today have had several employers, and been left with scraps of pensions from all these different jobs. In some cases they’ve got two from the same company, after a final salary scheme was shut down and replaced with one linked to the  stock market. It is these final salary benefits that typically push savers over a limit which prevents them from taking their smaller pots of cash. Allowing those with slightly bigger pots to discount their final salary benefits and cash in their small savings in defined contribution schemes is a practical step which will help 150,000 people. This rule change is likely to cost the Treasury nothing – it will still pull in the same amount of tax – but could be a valuable lifeline for hundreds of thousands of those who just want  to get a better deal for their  life savings.","Pensions worth less than £15,000 will be able to be drawn as lump sums .

A Ugandan benefit fraudster who stole £4million from the British taxpayer is claiming  asylum because of the disgrace she faces if she was sent home. Ruth Nabuguzi is insisting that relatives are angry at the shame she has brought on them through her criminal activities here. Nabuguzi was accused of an ‘outrageous abuse of the hospitality’ shown to her by Britain when she – along with a gang of other fraudsters – was convicted of  stealing more than £4.1million from taxpayers. The 20-year scam saw her gang create fake identities for up to 100 children to milk the benefits system. She was yesterday ordered by a judge to pay back £1.5million of the money she stole or face having her six-year jail sentence doubled. Nabuguzi had also claimed to have HIV and Aids to receive costly drugs which she then sent back to Uganda to be sold to genuine victims at a huge profit. It was estimated that supplying the medicines to her, as well as four other made-up patients, cost the taxpayer more than £2million. Now, in a further twist to her case, the Daily Mail has learned that Nabuguzi plans to make an asylum application in a bid to halt deportation. When she was jailed in November 2012 she was told that she would be kicked out of the country. Immigration sources have said that Nabuguzi claims her life could be ‘in danger’ if she returned to Uganda because of the ‘ill will’ felt towards her for the shame she has brought upon her family. ‘She has repeatedly said people who know her might wish to harm her when she returns to Kampala,’ said an immigration source. When the Nabuguzi case was first heard two years ago it emerged some £154,000 went on education for members of the ‘family’. The luxury flats in Kampala, Uganda, that were built using the proceeds of the scam . Fraud relating to accommodation costs and sub-letting of flats by Nabuguzi cost £650,000, and the family’s benefits, including child allowances, disability benefits, and council tax totalled £900,000. She re-appeared at Croydon Crown Court in South London last month for a hearing in which the defence and prosecution submitted arguments to Judge Nicholas Ainley – who presided over the 2012 trial – on how much she should repay. At yesterday’s confiscation hearing the judge announced his decision. She appeared in court alongside Ronald Kavuma, 37, who was told to repay £157,000. Last night Conservative MP Julian Brazier praised the actions of the judge and said: ‘I welcome the fact the judge has taken such a tough line. ‘However, I hope the tribunal that deals with this woman’s attempt to stay in this country do not allow her to do so. If they do allow her to remain the system is not fit for purpose.’ Immigration sources have said that Nabuguzi claims her life could be ¿in danger¿ if she returned to Uganda because of the ¿ill will¿ felt towards her for the shame she has brought upon her family . The lengthy 2012 trial heard that in a campaign of deceit lasting more than two decades Nabuguzi’s ‘family business’ saw them ‘conspire together to create, use and exploit’ false identities to carry out the staggering fraud. Eight of the group were sentenced to a total of 19 years by Judge Ainley. At the time he told Nabuguzi: ‘This was a fraud on a huge scale and it is an outrageous abuse of the hospitality you were offered by this country. ‘The identities you used and no doubt sold were then used by other people. You had no scruples in bringing children to this country and then involving them in your criminal pursuits. This was motivated entirely by greed.’ During the February hearing the judge heard how she had spent much of the stolen money on a complex consisting of luxury apartments, shops, restaurants and a hotel in her home city of Kampala, the Ugandan capital. Plans for properties were found when police raided the gang’s homes across East London. Yesterday the same judge told an emotionless Nabuguzi she had been behind a ‘large scale thriving business over a period of many years’. The judge told her that she had also rented out at least 15 properties to illegal immigrants and added: ‘Her evidence was that she was helping fellow Ugandans. That is nonsense. She was running a large scale business and she was running it for her own gain. ‘Money was sent out to Uganda and was deployed in building  complexes including flats, shops and hotels. She is the beneficial owner of a number of properties in Uganda. She will now have to dispose of them to pay monies back to this country.’ The judge told Nabuguzi to repay £1,512,34.43 in six months or face a further six years in prison. It emerged during the February hearing that another member of her gang was said to have boasted in prison that police had found only ‘the tip of the iceberg’ of what was stolen by the gang.","Ruth Nabuguzi claims her crimes in UK have shamed her in Uganda .

Tragedy has struck the family of murdered schoolgirl Holly Wells again with a court hearing how her cousin was killed when he smashed into gipsy horses running loose on a road. Thomas Allen, 23, was driving home with his girlfriend to see his family on Christmas Eve 2012 when he struck horses that had escaped from their field near Ipswich. He was rushed to hospital but died on Christmas day. Tragic: Thomas Allen (left), 23, was killed when he ploughed into stray gipsy horses near Ipswich on Christmas Eve 2012 while pictured right is his wrecked car after the accident . It was the second devastating tragedy to hit the family after Holly, 10, was brutally killed by evil Ian Huntley in August 2002 in a crime which stunned the nation. The horses belonged to gipsy Stacy Humphrys, 27, who was jailed for 28 months on Thursday for failing to keep the animals secured despite being warned that they posed a danger. Thomas, who would have been just 13 when Holly was murdered, ploughed into the beasts in pitch darkness on the A14 at 10.20pm. Holly’s parents, Kevin Wells, 50, and his wife, Nicola, 47, went to court to support Thomas’s devastated family. Judge John Devaux told Humphrys his horses had escaped repeatedly in the weeks before the tragedy and he had been warned they were a danger. Thomas was driving along the westbound carriageway of the A14 at Sproughton, near Ipswich, Suffolk, with his girlfriend when his car hit one of five stray horses. Critically-injured Thomas, of Soham, near Ely, Cambridgeshire, was taken to Ipswich Hospital but died on Christmas Day. Story that shocked the nation: Holly Wells (left) and her best friend, Jessica Chapman, both 10, were murdered by Ian Huntley in 2002 . Guilty: Stacy Humphrys, 27, was jailed for 28 months for failing to keep his horses secured . In an emotion-charged victim impact statement read to Ipswich Crown Court, his mother Lesley Allen described the heartache of having to tell her 14-year old daughter on Christmas Day that her big brother had died. But Mrs Allen, sister of Nicola Wells, said that they were proud that four seriously-ill people had received life-saving transplants as a result of the family’s brave decision to donate Thomas’s organs. Humphrys, of West Meadows gipsy site, Ipswich, admitted causing a public nuisance by allowing his horses to stray on to the A14. Judge Devaux accepted that fencing at the disused British Sugar site at Sproughton, where the animals were kept, could have been tampered with. But he told Humphrys that people who kept horses had a ‘general duty of care’ to keep them secure and prevent them getting out and running amok. Judge Devaux told the traveller: ‘This is not a case of being wise after the event. ‘You were well aware from previous and recent escapes that the site was unsuitable for keeping animals.’ He said Humphrys had been warned by police following earlier escapes but he’d done nothing. ‘You were warned they were a hazard and this was an accident waiting to happen,’ declared Judge Devaux. Family bond: Holly's mum and dad, Kevin and Nicola (left) were in court to support their relatives, Graham and Lesley Allen (middle) As well as Thomas’s death, six people were injured, three horses were killed and four vehicles badly damaged in the carnage. Nick Staite, prosecuting, said Humphrys had kept a herd of between 30 and 50 horses that had been ‘fly-grazing’ close to the A14. Mr Staite said a number of drivers had seen horses galloping along an unlit stretch of the A14 narrowly missing shocked motorists just before the deadly Christmas Eve tragedy. Paul Donegan, defending, said Humphrys had expressed ‘remorse’ for the horror smash and had co-operated with the authorities. Life sentence: Ian Huntley is serving a sentence of at least 40 years for the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman . Mr Donegan said he’d since acted to make the site more secure. He told the court: ‘He can’t say with certainty how and when the horses escaped but he accepts they did and that the responsibility lies with him and no-one else.’ Thomas’s shattered family said in a statement after seeing Humphrys jailed: ‘There is no relief or happiness here today, our loss is just as strong as it was on Christmas Day 2012. ‘Nothing can take away the total devastation and pain we feel. ‘Our lives will carry on but they will not be as we had planned. ‘Thomas is not with us any more and he should be here living his life and fulfilling all his goals and dreams. ‘This accident should never have happened.’ They added: ‘Tom was not doing anything wrong - he was just travelling home to his family for Christmas and sadly he never arrived. ‘All we, his family, have now are cherished memories of him. ‘Tom’s future has gone and ours has changed and nothing can make that better. ‘We will carry on rebuilding our lives without Thomas and at least now we have some kind of closure.’ Sgt Bob Patterson, of Suffolk Police’s Serious Collision Investigation Team, said after the case: ‘This was a truly horrific collision which resulted in the loss of a young man’s life. ‘It was compounded by the fact that a family lost their loved one on Christmas Day. ‘I hope that Stacy Humphrys’ guilty plea and sentencing will provide some comfort to Thomas’s family who have waited over a year for this day to come.’ Thomas was just 13 when his younger cousin Holly Wells was murdered along with her friend Jessica Chapman, also 10, in August 2002. Popular schoolgirl Holly lived near Thomas in the little village of Soham and they grew up together in a tight-knit family. Ian Huntley, a caretaker at Soham Village College, was convicted in December 2003 of the girls’ murders and jailed for at least 40 years.

When morbidly obese Dave Beevers’ wife Diane told him her dying wish was for him to lose weight he vowed he would turn his life round. For forty years he’d never exercised and had lived on an unhealthy diet of curries, chips, pizzas and chocolate. Now, just over a year since he lost his wife to Breast Cancer, he is a changed man. Dave has shed nearly ten stone and admits he is now hooked on running. Dave Beevers (left as he is now; right at 24st) has lost 10st since his wife died of breast cancer a year ago . Next month, on April 13th, he will run the Rotterdam Marathon in her memory and he says every time he runs, he feels her alongside him. And he knows she will be looking down with pride when he runs the race in the city where she was born, aiming to raise  £100,000 for Breast Cancer Care. Dave, 58, from Bolton, said: 'Diane’s dying wish was for me to lose weight. She said to me, ""You can’t carry on as you are. You’ve got to be here for the dogs."" 'It broke my heart. Our two dogs, Cassie and Bonnie were our world. I knew I had to change as they couldn’t lose their mum and their dad.' Diane died of metastatic breast cancer in February last year aged 71 after six years of treatment including a mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and tablets. When she came off her five-year course of medication last November, both she and Dave believed they had beaten the disease and started making plans for the future. Then last Christmas, Diane complained of feeling unwell and after a few weeks her condition worsened. Dave and his wife Diane, who passed away from breast cancer aged 71 . She was rushed to hospital where scan revealed the cancer had returned with a vengeance. She died just six days after being admitted. Dave said: 'I just felt numb. I sat there in a side room on the ward and couldn't take it in. It seemed like one minute she was there and we were making plans and the next minute she was gone. 'I felt not just alone, I felt vulnerable and alone. After her funeral I realised how much in bad shape I was.' At the time, Dave, who is 6ft 3in, tipped the scales at 24st, giving him BMI of 42 which made him morbidly obese. He had Type 2 diabetes and could barely walk up stairs. 'I was in a terrible way and I’d been in denial about my health for many years. But losing Diane made me realise I had to change. 'I wasn't going to become the sad, lonely, fat old man in the corner house. I was determined to reinvent myself and make Diane proud. Before losing weight Dave had trouble even walking up the stairs and had a BMI of 42 . 'Not only that, I also wanted to do something to help others going through what me and Diane had. I wanted her death to make a difference.' True to his word, after Diane's death Dave wasted no time ans sprung into action in order to fulfill his wife's final wish. 'Two months after I lost her, I joined Smith Hills Sports Centre, my local gym, to get fit. At first, I couldn’t even walk for a minute on the treadmill. 'But the staff there were lovely and supportive and I was determined I would run. I signed up for the City of Salford 5K in September, and I told myself I would complete it. 'It was very much one step at a time, and a walk became a run and each time I’d try to go that little bit longer. 'After a few months I ventured outside, running round my local park, which was just one kilometre. 'Then I built it up and up, so I’d be ready for the race that day. I also asked friends and family to sponsor me and raised £1600 for Breast Cancer Care which really spurred me on.' Since losing nearly ten stone, Dave's diabetes is now classed as dormant . Dave says that he has become addicted to running and has started his own blog - Running with Diane . Dave, a newspaper editor, also changed his diet dramatically. Before, he’d had a fry-up for breakfast, mid-morning snacks of crisps or chocolate, a lunch from the chip shop or curry house then pie and chips when he got home. He even admitted to eating the occasional sandwich whilst cooking his dinner. Now it’s strictly porridge or scrambled egg whites for breakfast, a protein shake mid-morning, a salad for lunch, a piece of fruit mid-afternoon and a main meal of chicken or oily fish plus vegetables for dinner. 'Diane’s dying wish was for me to lose . weight. She said to me, ""You can’t carry on as you are. You’ve got to be . here for the dogs.""' Dave now weighs just over 15st, has dropped seven shirt sizes and lost eight inches around his waist and hopes to reach his 14st target for the 26.2 mile race. He explained: 'I stopped the biscuits, pastries, ready meals, pizzas, curries and cheese. I love them all but they're just not compatible with what I was trying to achieve. 'That's not to say I haven't eaten those things in the last 12 months but just as occasional treats and I feel guilty afterwards. 'Instead I now eat slow release carbs like porridge, yams, granary bread, wholewheat pasta, brown rice and more fruit and veg.' Dave said that losing the weight has also been beneficial to his diabetes too. 'Not . only have I lost the weight, but I also feel more energised and better . mentally too. My diabetes is now classed as dormant, so I have the same . blood sugar levels as most people.' Dave has already completed several 10km . runs and half marathons in Preston and Lancaster and aims to do the . Rotterdam Marathon on April 13th in under five hours. Diane (right)  wanted her husband to get fit so that he could take care of their beloved dogs (pictured left) He said: 'We wanted to go before Diane passed away but the cancer returned and we never made it there. 'But I have been there since. I see it as the place where she learned to be the wonderful woman she was, and have met her friends who will be there to support me on the day. 'I am not a runner, never have been. But I have become passionate about it, something that I never dreamed would happen, and the only reason I can think of is that Diane has decided I needed to make a difference.' To support his fund-raising, he has started the online community blog Running With Diane at runningwithdiane.blogspot.co.uk and on Twitter @runwithdiane. Dave said of his blog: 'Those three words sum up how I feel when I’m running. I didn't want people to say I was running 'in her memory' or 'for' her. 'To me, I was running with her. She is my inspiration and driving force. I know the marathon will be tough, but when I need to dig deep, I will think of her. 'Every time I run, she runs with me. We have done everything together for over 20 years. Why should now be any different? 'Cancer's not beaten her. It took her body but it couldn't touch what made her special. We'll always have that. Especially when we're running together.'","Dave's wife's dying wish was for her obese husband to lose weight .

A women lost an astonishing 13st in a year - after finding she could barely make it up the stairs after the lift broke at work. Alison Robbins, 40, had to scale just four flights of steps but could not make it without gasping for breath and having to stop a couple of times. She was humiliated when a colleague 25 years older effortlessly strolled straight past her and finally decided to tackle her lifelong weight problem. When the lift broke at her office, Alison, who weighed 23st, was humiliated when she found she struggled to climb the stairs . Alison weighed 23st and  could only just squeeze into size 22 clothing but in just a year has managed to slim down to 10 stone and drop to a trim size 12. Alison, who works for Allianz insurance, said: 'I had to send my friend on ahead of me because I was so out of breath after climbing only two flights of stairs. 'It was very embarrassing because she is 25 years older than me. 'I thought 'she's fine and I'm here nearly dying'. I decided that in the New Year I would make a change for good. Alison embarked on a strict diet and took up exercise, managing to drop down to 10st and size 12 in a year . 'I knew I needed to lose weight, not just for my self esteem but also for my health. I had reached rock bottom and I wanted to do something about it.' Alison said her weight problems began at secondary school when she was physically and mentally tormented by classmates, deeply affecting her self esteem. Single Alison, now 41, added: 'I have always struggled with my weight and yo-yoed between dieting and comfort eating since I was 16 years old. 'I have gone from a size 10 to a size 28 and then back again. 'I have never felt comfortable with the way I looked and hated having my photo taken or looking in the mirror. It was the incident at her office, pictured, that was the prompt Alison needed to finally stop yo-yo dieting . 'As I piled on the weight I became even more depressed and started eating even more and I spent years caught in this vicious cycle. 'I needed to reach an all-time low in order to force me to do something about my weight and eating habits once and for all.' She joined a local Weight Watchers group in Yate, South Gloucestershire, and stuck to a strict diet and tough Zumba exercise timetable. Alison now routinely takes the stairs at work, even though the lift has long since been fixed. And she still attends a weekly Weight Watchers group as she is determined to keep her new trim figure. The group is led by Michelle Head who said: 'I am so proud of Alison. 'She has been such a huge inspiration to myself and the other members of our Weight Watchers meeting. 'She is proof that you can lose weight and keep it off and still enjoy life, including tempting times like summer holidays, birthdays and celebrations.'","Dropped from 23st and size 22 to 10st and a size 12 in just a year .

A student has spoken of her shock after her 'survival guide' to living with her four male flatmates became an online sensation. Hannah Reilly's 15-point list, written as a joke on her blog, reached over 25,000 viewers in 24 hours and has been shared more than 9,000 times. 'The response was overwhelming,' said the stunned student, 21. 'My website had over 25,000 hits in 24 hours.' Survival skills: Hannah Reilly, 21, was shocked when her blog on living with men became an online sensation . The guide to living with the members of the opposite sex includes vital tips such as not throwing out pizza crusts - which are 'for breakfast, not the bin'. Other pointers include advice on watching football matches ('Watching the football includes the pre-match discussions, game time and the post match discussion and analysis') and cleaning. Other pearls of wisdom include: 'There is always room in bin. Even if there isn't any room in the bin - there's always room in the bin and 'It is thoroughly acceptable to meet your very new girlfriend's parents for the first time on Christmas day. At their house. For Christmas dinner. Sometimes a man has to do what a man has to do.' Photography student Hannah, from Aberdeen, started living with her flatmates last September as she began her final year at university. In a rush to get into the property, she agreed to the lease before she met her flatmates. 'Moving in with the guys was easy, males have an openness and honesty and that four girls don't have. Messy: Hannah, 21, with her four male flatmates Alexander, Josh, John and Robin, all 23 . 'I miss female company, of course I do, but in this day and age all my female friends are a call, text or message away, so I'm not lonely. 'When my boyfriend visits he's met with a can of beer and FIFA propositions. He'd fit in anywhere but it's awesome that's he's made to feel so at home.' One flatmate, Alexander Kirby-Reynolds, 23, said: 'At first, it was a little bit awkward for us guys because you care about how you act in front of girls. 'After a while though that went away and Hannah just became another one of the guys. I don't think she was too happy about the mess in the kitchen to start with but I don't think she minds now, she was fighting a losing battle.'Despite her happy friendships with Alexander, Josh Knox, John Pratt and Robin Mears, who are all 23, Hannah still experiences day-to-day frustrations. 'They'll ask me what I've done today and what my plans for tomorrow and won't listen to my answer. Twenty minutes later it'll be all ""so what are you doing tomorrow Hannah?""

'I've developed a viewing techniques were I can stare through the screen as opposed to engage with what's going on.' For other women hoping to combat these hardships, Hannah has offered help with the appropriate mind-set for dealing with such situations.

Beaming in the spring sunshine on a rare day out without baby Mia, a radiant Zara Phillips was the picture of maternal joy. Seven weeks after she became a mum, there was no sign of the dreaded snap-back — the worrying trend in which celebrities shed their baby weight the second they leave the delivery suite. Nor has she succumbed to the pressure to stay indoors, away from prying eyes, until all signs of her pregnancy have been sweated off in the gym. As pictures of her enjoying herself at Cheltenham races this week prove, Zara is clearly taking a sensible approach to losing her baby weight. She is not showing off the flat tummy, model-esque legs or toned arms boasted by so many other post-partum celebrities, but, in short, she looks just like any other new mother. A day at the races: Zara chose an empire-line coat and opaque tights in her favourite colours for a day out at Cheltenham, after giving birth 7 weeks and 4 days ago . Hurrah for Zara! But while I wholeheartedly congratulate her for embracing her new figure, with its magnificent bosom and gently rounded stomach, I certainly can’t applaud her fashion choices. She’s often been criticised in the past, and again, here, the proportions are all wrong. The tiny hat only serves to make her seem bigger than she is. The empire-line cream coat drapes down from her new fuller bust, making her look a little like a ship in full sail, while the fussy horizontal bows and the high neckline do nothing to flatter her lovely new curves. And while endlessly fashionable, those clumpy shoe-boots don’t make the most of her excellent legs. Never known for her fashion sense, it seems Zara has made the classic mistake of jumping into her pre-baby style before her body has had a chance to ping back. I sympathise. I’ve been there. In the months after giving birth most women develop a strange kind of body dysmorphia — you’ve been huge for months, so as your bump deflates you suddenly feel svelte again. Overnight, getting dressed seems more appealing; after an eternity wearing your husband’s jogging bottoms and hideous maternity tents, perhaps it’s time to get your pre-baby look back? Any mother will remember that moment — it’s incredibly exciting. So exciting, in fact, that it’s all too easy to overlook the signs that you’re not quite back to your old self just yet. I recall one favourite jumpsuit that I couldn’t wait to wear after the birth of my son Mackenzie, now six. Three months after he was born I got one leg in, then another. I stuffed my arms into the sleeves and even managed to zip it up. I was so delighted by this fact that I even went out in it, only to catch sight of myself in a mirror which showed up the straining fabric across my midriff. And this is the issue; your body changes after a baby and you have to change the way you dress to suit it. It’s not about covering up, as Zara has done with her empire-line coat, it’s about accentuating your good bits and skimming the bits that need a bit more time. Dressing needs more thought, and a bit of a revamp. Zara has worn a uniform of cream, knee-length coat, black tights and boots to Cheltenham every year for the past decade. But while it might have worked beautifully on her pre-baby body, it is not the best shape on the other side of the motherhood divide. The raised waist of the empire line cuts across her impressive embonpoint, making her silhouette much rounder than necessary. An empire line should tuck just under your bra-line, emphasizing your amazing assets and adding definition to your shape; without that your chest and tummy merge, adding weight where there really isn’t any to hide. 'All things considered, the most important thing for a new mother is comfort.' Reaching for roomier clothes is a habit that many mothers fall into. The logic, which, again, I know so well, is that if you embrace baggy, no-one will notice that your waist has gone on an extended holiday. Sorry, but actually you need clothes to fit properly. And this is something that the other young royal mum, the Duchess of Cambridge, seems well aware of. When the ever-chic Kate was photographed looking fabulous just seven weeks after giving birth to Prince George, she plumped for a dazzling floor-length gown which skimmed her frame. While comparisons of Kate’s post-baby body and Zara’s are unfair — they were completely different to start with — Zara could have opted for a longer, more fitted frock like Kate’s to break up her silhouette. If you’re not sure of your shape, stick with wider necklines, which are much more slimming, and go for a print to break up your body. And while Zara has wonderful legs, the black opaque tights are too harsh and unladylike against the pale coat. Sleeves are a major issue for new mums too; go loose and you add unwelcome volume, but too tight like Zara and we’re back to the problem with my jumpsuit — flesh straining against the fabric. Accessories are the fun bit — they always fit — and I can imagine Zara’s glee at ditching the nappy bag for a clutch. The key is to keep things in proportion. Big accessories make you look smaller, but that hat looks like it would fit Mia. Shoes, too, can be problematic, especially as your feet are still prone to swelling. Zara opted for a shoe-boot shape with a stiletto heel that she may be cursing after a long day at the races. All things considered, the most important thing for a new mother is comfort. New mums need to feel comfortable in their roles, in their new wardrobes, and in themselves. But ultimately, the best accessory for every new mum is a huge smile and Zara’s got that spot on.

Breast cancer patients are routinely being let down by the NHS due to the insensitivity of doctors and nurses, a report warns today . Breast cancer patients are routinely being let down by the NHS due to the insensitivity of doctors and nurses, a report warns today. Many of those surveyed say staff were uncaring or casual when breaking the devastating news that they had the disease. Other women are being made to drive a 60-mile round trip for exhausting radiotherapy, having been told by staff to make their own way there. Sufferers also say they are not treated like human beings and, at times, are not given enough emotional support to help deal with the pain, side-effects and sometimes the prospect of death. Breast Cancer Campaign, which compiled the report, also alleges that the NHS is failing to provide enough help for the thousands of women with secondary tumours – which are often terminal. Many are not put in touch with specialist nurses who provide pain relief, end of life care and also help women make crucial decisions about refusing treatment and where to die. A report by the charity today says one in eight women with breast cancer said doctors were insensitive when giving them the heartbreaking diagnosis. Another 17 per cent were not given enough information about the illness and 15 per cent were not properly told about the surgery. Nearly 50,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in Britain every year and it leads to 11,500 deaths. Around 570,000 are living with breast cancer, including 36,000 with secondary tumours that have spread to other organs and are incurable. Although the NHS has made huge advances in treatment, screening and early diagnosis, campaigners say women are being failed by a lack of care and emotional support. Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Campaign, said efforts to monitor the standards of care within the NHS were ‘virtually non-existent’. ‘It’s not enough to pay lip service to standards of care and consider that job done,’ she said. ‘Women living with breast cancer face many challenges, but poor-quality care should not be one of them. Caroline Brook, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 . Caroline Brook, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, says she was made to feel like a tumour rather than a human being. The 44-year-old businesswoman from Stotfold, Bedfordshire, faced a two-hour drive for radiotherapy because the hospital said she was well enough to make her own way there and had to wait an hour and a half for the results of the final scan which told her she was in the clear. At one point she got lost in the system and staff failed to book her mammogram. ‘The hospital departments don’t speak to each other. To them I was just a breast person, a chemotherapy person, a radiotherapy person,’ she said. ‘You just feel like you are one of their little boxes.’ ‘We have a group of women who are really gravely ill who are just being lost in the numbers.’ Ciaran Devane, chief executive at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘Whilst most of the NHS delivers fantastic care every day, we know that cancer patients are still being let down when they are at their most vulnerable.’ The report looked at the care of 13,916 women who took part in the NHS’s annual cancer patient experience survey last year. Twelve per cent said they should have been told about their cancer more sensitively and 17 per cent were not given any written information about the illness. Another 22 per cent said they weren’t given enough information about side-effects and 40 per cent weren’t warned about long-term repercussions of treatment. And 40 per cent – many of them terminally ill – said their family were not given enough support to help care for them at home. Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said: ‘We want world-class cancer services for all patients and all cancers. What we know is that although we have made great strides over recent years, quality varies between cancers and across the country.’","Many told by staff to 'make own way' on 60 mile round radiotherapy trips .

Stephen Power suffered terrible  injuries in a motorbike accident 18 months ago, fracturing his skull and breaking both cheek bones, his jaw, eye socket and nose. After early operations the 29-year-old still had a lopsided face and collapsed cheek – and feared he would never have the confidence to appear in public again. Before: Stephen Power sustained fractured cheek bones and eye sockets, while his upper jaw and skull were smashed after a motorbike accident . After: He has now made surgical history after having his skull reconstructed by groundbreaking 3D technology in a world-first operation . However surgeons were too worried to carry out any further procedures in case his eyesight was damaged. Now revolutions in surgical technology have allowed them to reconstruct Mr Power’s face with 3D-printed titanium implants – thought to be the first operation of its kind anywhere in the world. Despite wearing a crash helmet, Mr Power, from Cardiff, spent four months in hospital after the accident. After preliminary operations, doctors at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, decided they had to break his cheekbones again before rebuilding his face. Painstaking: The facial models, guides and implants which were all 3D printed by the team at Swansea's Morriston Hospital . Design engineers at Cardiff Metropolitan University used CT scans to create and print a 3D plastic model of Mr Power’s skull and the section of his cheek to be repaired. A series of 3D-printed cutting guides allowed the surgeons to accurately cut and reposition broken bones. In the final stage of the eight-hour operation, two printed titanium implants were slotted into Mr Power’s broken eye socket and cheek, and the cutting guides were removed. Pioneering: Mr Power's skull after the operation with temporary staples . His surgeon said: 'Stephen had a very complex injury and correcting it involved bones having to be re-cut into several fragments' Dr Dominic Eggbeer, head of  surgical design at the university’s National Centre for Product Design and Development Research, said: ‘It was like solving a jigsaw puzzle. The pieces of bone had been  displaced in the accident and had reset in the wrong place. The aim was to cut them apart and then pull them back into place.’ Surgeon Adrian Sugar says the 3D printing made the reconstruction far more accurate than previous methods. ‘The results are in a different league from anything we’ve done before,’ he said. ‘Stephen had a very complex injury and correcting it involved bones having to be re-cut into several fragments. It made sense to plan it in three dimensions and that is why 3D printing came in, and successive 3D printing, because at every different stage we had a model.’ Mr Power's surgeon said he was pleased with the results of the operation, adding: 'Stephen's eye is now a little bit raised, but that might settle over the next few months' Mr Power, who worked in a bar before his accident, said his face is now almost back to normal. ‘It is totally life changing,’ he said. ‘I could see the difference straight away the day I woke up from the surgery.’ Mr Power, who used a hat and glasses to mask his injuries before the operation, added: ‘I’m hoping I won’t have to disguise myself. I’ll be able to do day-to-day things, go and see people, walk in the street. ‘It has just made me look a lot  better. I take my hat off to them.’","Stephen Power was involved in a motorbike crash in September 2012 .

A height of 5ft 9in, thigh gap and cheekbones to rival Kate Moss' were once prerequisites when it came to breaking the modelling industry - but Lucy Greene and Pandora Lennard are trying to change all that. The two young entrepreneurs have set up the Anti-agency, which hand-picks talent based not on their looks or size but on their personality, passions and individual style. Speaking to MailOnline about their new business venture, founders Lucy and Pandora, both 24 and from London, said: 'We don't look for stereotypical models, we look for boys and girls with great personality, good style, charisma and interesting hobbies; the whole package.' Founders: Pandora Lennard and Lucy Greene, both 24 and from London, have set up the Anti-agency, where they scout non stereotypical models . Forget outside Topshop on Oxford Street, the duo, who worked in fashion before setting up the Anti-agency nine months ago, scout talent on Facebook, at art galleries and at gigs where they know they'll find 'interesting' people. Speaking about their selection process, they said: 'Our models may be good looking but we specifically choose to use ""head shots"" so that people aren't judged on their height or weight by clients. We have models ranging from size 6-14 and 5ft 4in to 6ft 2in of all ethnicities.' Different: The founders say they don't judge a model by their cheekbones or weight but by their personalities and interests (pictured: journalist Sydney) Selection process: The girls say they 'unintentionally' scout talent, whether it's at an art gallery or gig (pictured: make-up artist Portia and skateboarder Rico) Interesting: The agency, which has been operating for nine months, scouts people with interesting passions and supports their careers (pictured: student Chiara) She continues: 'The agency is for people who could’ve been models and decided not to, for people who are too cool to be models and people with real lives on the verge of exploding in music, fashion, art, illustration and creative industries. 'We're here to provide casting solutions for companies and to promote people we believe in, as well as supporting their careers.' Lucy and Pandora, whose client list includes the likes of Dr. Martens, Urban Outfitters and Asos, maintain that they'd never ask or encourage their talent to change the way they are. Head shots: The agency only send head shots of their talent round so that potential clients don't judge them on their height or weight (pictured: fashion student Tyler and, right, artist Josh) Success: Despite only operating for nine months, the girls have had their talent walk in Pam Hogg and Vivienne Westwood shows this season (pictured left, poet Amy and right, fashion student Abby) 'They are what they are. We've had people making yearly wages from a bit of modelling but none of them want to go full time, they are focused on their respective careers. Some are artists, others are musicians.' Despite only operating for nine months, the girls have had their talent walk in Pam Hogg and Vivienne Westwood shows this season, as well as in Giles alongside Cara Delevingne - who they credit for shaking up the industry. 'Cara represents a change in the industry, clients want models with big personalities. Models like Cara and Chloe Nørgaard have other strings to their bows and a huge social media following because of their interesting personalities - they are building a brand,' they said. The agency currently has nearly 100 models on its books and the founders have big plans for the future. 'We can't believe how well things are going, we want to go global. In five years time we see ourselves opening up in New York and LA, that would be the dream.'

Barbara Naughton, 32, an actress from Ireland, was a child when a visceral dislike of the way she looks set in. Following an accident that left her with a crooked nose, growing up, Barbara loathed her looks so much, she couldn't bear to look at photographs of herself and even confesses to slashing them with a knife. But after shelling out £7,500 for a nose job abroad, Barbara was left worse off than ever before after her Czech surgeon botched the job so badly, she is barely able to breathe. Problems: Barbara says she has lost her smile because of the botched attempt at lip plumping . A supplementary operation to plump up her lips also went wrong, and as a result, the devastated actress says she has lost her smile. 'Every time I saw a photograph of . myself, I just hated it,' she explains of her life before surgery. 'I used to slash a knife through that photograph . and say, ""that's not the way I came into this world!"" 'I thought it would be better going abroad because it's cheaper and I thought you'd get the same quality of surgery.' After paying £7,500 for her operation, flight and aftercare, Barbara travelled to the Czech capital, Prague, for treatment and agreed to an additional procedure on her upper lip after hearing its benefits extolled by the surgeon. 'He said ""Your lip, I could enhance . the top layer so it matches the bottom lip which has all the volume in . it"",' remembers Barbara. Horror: Despite being assured things would improve, Barbara was left with a permanently swollen upper lip . Before: Barbara with the nose that she loathed before going under the knife in the Czech Republic . Improvement: Barbara has since had the strip of fat implanted into her upper lip removed . 'So I thought ""I'll try that surgery"".' But the treatment, which involved grafting a strip of fat into the upper lip, was to have disastrous results. 'I woke up after surgery and I didn't . understand why my whole face was covered,' she remembers. Barely able to breathe through her nose and the owner of a pair of what Barbara describes as 'pulsating lips', she frantically questioned the surgeon about whether this was normal and was told that everything would be fine in a couple of months' time. 'I waited patiently for several months, . isolated myself waiting for the big change to happen,' explains Barbara. But nothing did. 'My smile was gone,' she adds. 'My nostrils were as wide as a pig's nose. I thought, ""What in God's . name has happened to me?""' Commenting on the case, Niall Kirkpatrick, a consultant cranio-facial surgeon based in London, says that experiences like Barbara's are all too common. 'Laws abroad are very different to in the . UK,' he explains. 'It's a sad fact that cosmetic surgery is not well regulated in this . country, let alone abroad.' In a bid to fix the damage, Barbara travelled back to Prague to confront the bungling surgeon and was offered a second cut-price operation - which once more had terrible results. Now £9,000 in the red, Barbara says she's furious about what happened and claims the surgeon betrayed the trust she placed in him. 'I don't have my smile anymore,' she adds. 'I put my . trust and faith in the clinic and they've betrayed my trust.

One lucky Briton has 108 million reasons to be cheerful today after hitting last night's EuroMillions jackpot to become the UK's fourth biggest lottery winner ever. The as yet unnamed individual had the only ticket to hit the jackpot and has become the UK’s fourth biggest lottery winner. A Lottery spokesman said: ‘With the weather set fair for the coming week, this UK winner is set fair for the rest of their lives having just become a multi-millionaire. Scroll down for video . The lucky winner's wealth now exceeds that of musicians Robbie Williams, left, and George Michael, right, who both have reported fortunes of £105million . ‘This single UK ticket-holder will enter the exclusive top five on the National Lottery Rich List – at No 4.’ According to the Sunday Times Rich List for 2013, their new found-fortune automatically makes them the 745th richest person in the UK. Their wealth exceeds that of musicians George Michael (£105million), Robbie Williams (£105million)  and David Bowie (£100million). The main numbers were 6, 24, 25, 27 and 30, with the lucky star numbers 5 and 9. It means they take home a princely £107,932,603. The life-changing sum could help the winner buy their own Greek island such as Omfori, currently being advertised for just over £41 million, a Lamborghini Veneno, one of the world's most expensive cars at a cost of £2.4 million, and still have plenty left to spend. Affordable: Lat night's winners could soon be behind the wheel of a a Lamborghini Veneno, one of the world's most expensive cars - a snip a just £2.4 million . Or the winner could splash most of the money in a single purchase to buy a 21-bedroom home in London's Mayfair, which is on the market for £90 million.

Walsh, 57, James Bennett, 28, Sean Connor, 32, Alex Parry, 19, Emma . Cartwright, 23, Ceri Scullion, 35, and Donna Rhodes, 39, each banked . £6.5million. Sunseeker superyacht . If a life on the ocean waves appeals then yesterday's winner should get hold of the latest Sunseeker catalogue. The Dorset company's brand new 155 model would be a ideal choice but at a cool £32million it would take a large chunk out of their new found fortune. Boasting five bedrooms, enabling then to host up to 10 guests at once, the four-deck yacht also has space for 11 members of staff. Other perks include a nightclub, day room, 'beach club' and a panoramic viewing platform - which could allow guests a perfect view of the Monaco Grand Prix if Mr Jordan decides to attend the society event. The yacht is 155ft long and weighs a total of 200 tonnes, with a maximum speed of 22 knots (25mph), and can travel 4,000 nautical miles in a single journey. Filling up the boat's 60,000-litre engine with diesel will cost £30,000 every time. Rolls Royce Phantom . Lottery winners and Rolls Royce are the perfect match and a top of the range Phantom model is easily within budget at £300,000. The Phantom is a classic choice for the super rich, and they are all assembled by hand at the Rolls-Royce factory in Goodwood, West Sussex. A-list celebrities David Beckham, Simon Cowell, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone and Eddie Murphy have all been spotted riding in the car. It is also a favourite of the royal family and heads of state worldwide – an earlier version of the Phantom was presented to the Queen as a gift on her Silver Jubilee. However, to get the full experience they would need to add a chauffeur. Private Island . Flashy cars, superyachts and private jets are all very well, but to really join ranks of the super rich you'll need a private Island. And they could do a lot worse than the stunning Greek Island of Omfori. The uninhabited island located in the Ionian Sea covers some 4 500 000 sq metres (1112 acres) and is currently up for sale for £40million. Widely considered one of the most beautiful islands in the region, it features a beautiful beach surrounded by tranquil turquoise waters. Private jet . First class just doesn't cut the mustard when you've got £100 million burning a hole in your pocket so a private jet is really the only way to fly. Learjet are the market leaders and we think their 60xr model would be the sensible choice. With a range of 2,405 nautical miles it shoud be easily capable of taking then and three passengers wherever they want to go. The cabin is decked out with leather and walnut veneer and it's easily within budget at £8million. A flat at One Hyde Park . It is the most expensive block of flats in the world with entry level apartments starting at £5million and the penthouse going for eyewatering £65million. Buyers will join a roll call of billionaire residents, including developer Christian Candy, who owns two properties at One Hyde Park. The property tycoon, who built the apartments with his brother Nick, owns two separate flats worth £31m and £26.2m on the 10th floor.Two other apartments were sold for a combined £136 million to Ukrainian mining tycoon Rinat Akhmetov, who is thought to be investing a further £50 million to knock the properties together and refit them.","Lucky winner enters exclusive top five on the National Lottery Rich List .

Prosecutors do not plan to file charges against Jeffrey Giuliano, said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity, because investigators have not released their findings. State police have said Giuliano went outside with a gun around 1 a.m. on September 27, 2012, when his sister called to say someone was trying to break into her house next door. Authorities say Giuliano saw a masked person holding a knife come toward him in a threatening manner and shot him. Scroll down for video . Mistaken identity: Tyler Giuliano was shot dead by his father, police said, as he tried to break into his aunt's home . Mistake: Jeffrey Giuliano opened fire on a burglary suspect next-door, only to find that he was in fact his adopted son, Tyler . He later was told the person was his son Tyler, who died of multiple gunshot wounds. State's Attorney Stephen Sedensky III is expected to release his findings Friday, marking the conclusion of his investigation into the shooting in New Fairfield, a town of nearly 14,000 about 50 miles from New York City. At the time of the shooting, Giuliano thought the masked person had a gun, his attorney, Gene Zingaro, has said. He later learned it was a knife. 'My client felt like his life was in imminent danger at the time he fired,' he said in 2012.'In my opinion, Jeff Giuliano had a fear of being shot at the time he fired his weapon.' Zingaro declined to comment Friday morning, but he had said he did not expect any charges to be filed against Giuliano. The attorney said Giuliano knew of reports of a break-in and a sexual assault in the same town. Giuliano was so concerned that he called a family meeting to make sure his children took precautions, he said. The Giuliano home: The family's attorney Gene Zingaro, who arrived at the scene shortly after the shooting, said the father was inconsolable and physically ill - crying and vomiting . Mr Giuliano had gone outside with his gun after his sister called to say someone was trying to break into her house next door (pictured) 'Weighing heavily on his mind was the fact that there was a forced entry rape a day or two before in New Fairfield,' Zingaro said. 'In my estimation, Jeff Giuliano felt like he had happened upon maybe the same intruder.' Zingaro has said Giuliano had shouted several commands before the shooting, but he would not disclose what his client said. Asked if Tyler responded, he said, 'not audibly.' Giuliano and his wife adopted Tyler and his sister about four years before the shooting. The children would have gone into foster care if the couple, who had three other children, had not adopted them, Zingaro said. The family was 'heartbroken' after Tyler's death. The teen's funeral was attended by over 900 people. Tyler and his adoptive father shared a love of music and the Civilian Air Patrol, in which Tyler served as a cadet and enjoyed flying gliders and small aircraft, Zingaro said. Giuliano, affectionately known around Meeting House Hill School as Mr. G, holds summer music and zoology camps for his students and plays guitar in a local rock band that raises money for charity, schools superintendent Alicia Roy said at the time.","Giuliano saw a masked person holding a knife come toward him in a threatening manner and shot him .

Dickson was invited to the Playboy Golf Finals held March 30, 2012 at the Industry Hills, according to the complaint. Klein is a co-host of the Playboy Morning Show. She complied with a request early in the day to lie ‘flat on her stomach with her buttocks partially exposed for a photograph’ with Klein, the suit first reported by TMZ alleges. ‘A golf tee was then placed between the cheeks of her buttocks and a golf ball was balanced on top of the tee,’ the suit continues. Dickson was led to believe that the pose would include only a depiction of Klein hitting the ball of the tee for a picture, and not him actually swinging the golf club – but he did swing the club, and he missed badly. ‘[Dickson] sustained severe bodily injuries, a portion of which are permanent,’ according to the lawsuit.

Millions of passengers on the West Coast mainline face a decade of ‘catastrophic’ disruption caused by work on the £50billion HS2 high-speed project, a damning dossier of official papers reveals today. Train bosses also warn of delays and train shortages on the link between London, the North and Scotland and chronic passenger overcrowding on platforms at London Euston, one of Britain’s busiest stations. Up to four out of 10 trains risk running late between 2016 and 2026 as preparation and construction work is carried out on the southern terminus of the proposed high-speed project. Millions of passengers on the West Coast mainline face a decade of 'catastrophic' disruption caused by work on the £50bn HS2 high-speed project, a damning dossier of official papers reveals today . Campaigners say Euston will be turned into 'the Heathrow of rail' and that West Coast and commuter passengers will pay the price of the Government's high-speed 'folly' Internal documents seen by the Mail reveal forecasts that show punctuality and performance will 'be likely to worsen by between 4 and 8 per cent’ though warns ‘bad days would be significantly worse'. Until now, passengers have been unaware of the full extent to which their conventional long-distance and commuter lines face disruption while platforms at Euston are closed and services cut to make way for the new HS2 line. Train companies including Virgin are understood to be furious at the prospect of disruption to one of the nation’s two main London to Scotland routes serving Birmingham, the North West of England and on to Glasgow. Campaigners say Euston will be turned into ‘the Heathrow of rail’ and that West Coast and commuter passengers will pay the price of the Government’s high-speed 'folly'. Details have emerged from documents obtained following a series of Freedom of Information requests by campaigners at the HS2 Action Alliance (HS2AA) and shown to the Mail. They make clear that the Department for Transport and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin are fully aware and in the loop over the impending West Coast chaos. Campaigners against the scheme say the problems unearthed are just ‘the tip of the iceberg’. The FOI documents reveal . The first phase of the high-speed line from London to Birmingham is due for completion in 2026, with a second phase, taking the line on a Y-shaped route to north west and north east England, due to be finished in 2032/33. The Government also suffered a blow this week when Mr McLoughlin admitted for the first time that the HS2 Bill will now miss its target of being passed through Parliament before next year’s General Election. Richard Houghton, of HS2 Action Alliance, who made the Freedom of Information request, said: ‘This is turning into a pantomime. ‘From the moment spades go in the ground, HS2 will needlessly create the very sort of chaos and capacity crisis it is proposed to avoid.’ A Department for Transport spokeswoman defended the Euston works noting: 'HS2 will deliver jobs, skills and regeneration, freeing up desperately-needed space on the railway, but we cannot continue to patch and mend. 'Londoners and commuters are calling for the regeneration of Euston, overcrowding on this line into London is one of the reasons why we're building HS2 – to create extra capacity, that will ‎benefit the millions that use the station every year.'

She's lit up TV screens for many years with her warmth and friendly persona but television presenter Gabby Logan has revealed an . altogether cattier side, describing Andy Murray as 'the moodiest most miserable b******' she has ever met. The 40-year-old revealed her view of the two-time Grand Slam winner in a talk to students at Leeds Trinity University. Speaking about Murray, the BBC Sports Presenter said: 'I was a big fan. 'Then at the Olympics he had just won a silver with Laura Robson and he was the moodiest most miserable b****** I've ever met in my life because he only won a silver.

It wasn't just the 26-year-old Wimbledon champion who Logan had a dig at. According to The Sun she also poked fun at Paula Radcliffe who urinated in the street during 2005's London Marathon saying: 'One guy tweeted and said my wife thinks Paula's dress is nicer than yours. So I showed Paula and she p***ed herself. Again.' Speaking about Gary Lineker, she is reported to have said that most people see him now as a crisp salesman rather than a footballer adding 'sorry they see him as a broadcaster.' Presenters: Logan (left) hosts TV show Splash! alongside Olympian Tom Daley (centre) and Vernon Kay (right) A spokesman for Mrs Logan told The Sun: 'These people are friends and acquaintances of Gabby's who she has the utmost admiration for and the quotes clearly formed part of a humorous speech.' Last month Mrs Logan revealed she suffered body ‘angst’ when she was a teenager and that she now secretly fears for her daughter’s health. The Splash! TV presenter admitted she and her husband worry that Lois, who is eight, could develop body image issues as she grows up.

Mrs Logan said: ’I would never want my daughter to think she had to eat less of something. We talk about over eating, about how that’s not good, to eat more than you need to. All in good jest: Gabby Logan also poked fun at Gary Lineker (left) and Paula Radcliffe (right) during the talk . ‘But at the same time you can give those messages without it being about body image, it’s about health again. It all comes back to health as opposed to being svelte or fitting into your jeans.’ Mrs Logan, who is married to Kenny, 41, said: ‘I was always aware, when you do gymnastics you’re always in a leotard – you can’t be any more, the next thing is being naked. And so you’re very aware of your body so when I hit puberty I didn’t want to change.' Mrs Logan has now joined a Tesco healthy eating campaign called Eat Happy.","Presenter remarks follow Murray's Olympic silver in the mixed doubles .

An obscure Welsh folk band thought they were being pranked when they landed the gig of a lifetime, after being booked by the Pentagon to go on a tour of U.S. Air Force bases around the world. The five friends who play in the Wee Bag Band, a group more well known as an unsigned pub band, will be flown more than 15,000 miles by the Air Force to bases in Cuba, Greenland, Bahamas and Honduras. Their next stop of the ten day tour will be Cuba, where are flying via military plane from Baltimore to perform for the troops celebrating St. Patrick's day for an undisclosed amount. Scroll down for video . The Wee Bag Band from Denbighshire, Wales who have been handed a gig of a lifetime after being booked by the Pentagon to tour far-flung US Air Force bases . Members of the band were stunned when they got an e-mail from U.S. military chiefs asking them to perform for the troops. Before they agreed, they had to call up the Pentagon to check that they weren't part of an elaborate prank or a con. All five members of the band, which includes Paul Bassom, Rory McGough, Steve Own, Julian Anderson and Alan Colinson,  have regular day jobs, ranging from motor engineering to computer work. For years they have been playing Irish music at weddings, pubs and festivals, but now they're taking a tour from Central America to the Antarctic Circle. Video courtesy of Peter Simmonds . The band is ordinarily a pub band, and has played at events like weddings and festivals for around five years . Luck o' the Irish: Their brand of music is primarily Irish jig music, which they intend to use to get the members of the U.S. force dancing . Lead singer and IT consultant Rory McGough said: 'The first thing I got was an email from the Pentagon asking if could we come and play some music. 'I thought it was like one of those scams about putting money into a bank account from Nigeria so I was going to put it into the spam folder. 'But I thought I had better check, and low and behold the next thing I am being asked if we could manage to do a week-long world tour! The trip: Their ten day tour will take them around the world, from sunny Cuba to freezing Greenland . Flying: Beginning by flying from Manchester to Baltimore, then on to the world's destinations . 'We seem to have a lot of friends now who play tambourine and would like to tag along.' The pub band from the tiny rural town of Denbigh, in North Wales, will cover thousands of miles between military bases to play Irish music for the troops. Their tour will see them fly from Manchester to Baltimore, Baltimore to Greenland, then back to Baltimore before flying to Cuba via Florida. Live: The Welsh band also take their brand of Irish folk music to festivals and other events . The band has been advertising their tour in the U.S. Air Forces they are playing for to celebrate St. Patrick's Day . After playing for the troops in Cuba they fly on to the Bahamas before going back to Florida to fly to Honduras and then to Miami before flying home. They will be starting off in the remote icy wilderness of Thule in northern Greenland - making them the most northerly gigging band in the world. McGough said: 'The US Military have told us that when we play at Thule in Greenland we will set the record for the most northerly gig ever played by a British band. Their music has seen them play in front of crowds of hundreds in large venues, to smaller pubs with only dozens in the audience . Not spam: The band had to check that they weren't being scammed before they took the opportunity, with one member saying 'I was going to put it into the spam folder' 'Also this is the first time the USAF have asked a non-USA band to perform at their bases. 'By all accounts they're really looking forward to it because they've never had anything like it before. 'And of course the Americans have a huge Irish contingency and sometimes celebrate St Patrick's day more than the Irish do.' After braving Greenland with temperatures of -13F they will be flown by the U.S. Air Force into the 86F heats of Cuba. Support worker Paul Bassom, who plays guitar and sings in the band, said he was keen to promote dancing among the troops. The band think that they were selected because some of the U.S. bases have a huge Irish contingency and celebrate St Patrick's day more than the Irish do . Tag along: The Wee Bag Band has noticed they have a lot of friends who 'can play tambourine and want to join us' He said: 'I've got this image in my head of those old black and white films where all the forces are having the gang show and all sitting in seats. 'We're just going to have to ask them to get rid of a few, aren't we?' Tin whistle and mandolin player Rory hopes that if it all goes well they could end up playing for the President.

Irish eyes were smiling on the White House a few days early this year. Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny kicked off the St. Patrick's Day holiday at events across Washington Friday, including a meeting with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office. 'I think it's fair to say that there are very few countries around the world where the people-to-people ties are so strong,' said Obama, who donned a green tie and sprigs of four-leaf clovers on his lapel.

Sitting alongside House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, Obama and Kenny were entertained by a two-man Irish band and a bagpiper. Kenny started his day with a breakfast at the residence of Vice President Joe Biden, who has an Irish background. Biden and Kenny dined on eggs, potatoes and Irish soda bread. Obama joked that Biden 'lobbies me every week to go to Ireland.' The luncheon tradition dates back several years and is one of the few times the President visits The Capitol other than when he makes a speech, reports the Washington Post. Singers at the luncheon invited the crowd to join in a rendition of 'Wild Rover,' with Obama, Boehner and others giving it their all. The president has his own distant family ties to Ireland. In 2011, he visited the village of Moneygall, the hometown of his great-great-great grandfather. 'Tell everybody in Moneygall I said, ""hi,"" Obama said.' Amid the festivities, Obama and Kenny addressed the political crisis in Ukraine, where voters in the Crimean Peninsula will hold a referendum Sunday on whether to join Russia. Moscow moved military forces into Crimea after Ukraine's pro-Russian leader fled amid popular protests. 'We continue to hope that there's a diplomatic solution to be found,' Obama said. 'But the United States and Europe stand united not only in its message about Ukrainian sovereignty but also that there will be consequences if, in fact, that sovereignty continues to be violated.'

These photographs show the moment a smartly-dressed man was caught in the act stealing sandbags from a 60 metre wall protecting homes from rising floodwaters. The barrier, constructed by the Navy in Datchet, Berkshire, has been targeted four times in recent days, prompting residents to take action. The thieving has been so rife that entire sections of the wall have had to be rebuilt. Scroll down for videos . Caught in the act: Residents in Datchet captured the moment a smartly dressed man apparently stole a number of sandbags from a 60 metre wall erected by the Navy to protect homes from the rising floodwaters . Repeat thefts: People living in the submerged Berkshire town said the sandbag barrier has been targeted four times in recent days, forcing people to rebuild large sections of the wall . Residents have formed a home guard vigilante group to monitor the barrier, with a rota round the clock of two hour shifts, to curb the stealing. The sandbags were put up by the Navy because of fears that a nearby wall holding back powerful flood waters could soon give way. Speaking on Tuesday at a national press conference, Mr Cameron said: 'Clearly the most serious developing situation is in the Thames Valley. 'Military deployment began with the building of a sixty metre wall at Datchet.' A resident has managed to take photographs of suspected thieves, including a man in a suit loading sandbags into the back of his grey van. Two other men, also pictured, arrived at the same time in a van before making off with sandbags. An eye-witness said: 'People have just been coming here and helping themselves, its outrageous. 'This is a wall put up by the Navy for a reason and was even mentioned by the Prime Minister, but little does he know parts of it have had to be rebuilt. 'The residents are saying enough is enough and have started a 24-hour watch. Hopefully it will be enough to deter these people.' Retired HR worker Sue Blumsom, 65, who has lived in the town for 36 years, is among those taking turns to keep guard. Ms Blumsom, whose garden and garage have been flooded, said: 'We are not happy about it. 'People have been coming along and taking what they want without thinking of anyone else. It is not very pleasant.' Rumours are circulating in the town that a number of local businesses are among those to have taken sandbags from the Southlea Road wall. Meanwhile beleaguered flood victims have hit out at so-called 'grief capitalists' who have been selling stolen sandbags at huge profits to vulnerable people. In some cases, the makeshift flood defence measure has been sold for four or five times the normal price. One elderly woman is said to have paid £80 for a couple of bags, such was the desperation to protect her home. play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video .

Rota: Residents in Datchet have joined Mrs Blumsom and Mrs Charters, left, taking their turns to guard the wall of sandbags on a rota basis. Signs erected nearby say: 'Flood defences. Do not remove sandbags', right . Praise: Speaking at a national press conference Prime Minister David Cameron this week hailed the wall of sandbags as vital in protecting residents from the floodwaters . The community of Egham in Surrey has been battling with rising flood waters ever since Sunday night. But after having to wait for sand bags to be delivered, some woke up the following day to find they had been stolen - and being sold to their neighbours. To compound the misery, thieves have also targeted properties vacated by reluctant homeowners as the stagnant water creeps over the threshold. Resident Sandra Slark said: 'It's outrageous and disgusting. The people here are suffering enough. 'To find their homes looted hours later, their possessions stolen - it's plain wrong.' Her partner Martin Warner, who keeps returning regularly to check on their home after being evacuated on Tuesday, said: 'People need the sandbags so they are paying crazy money. 'You can't blame them. People are desperate. You hear people talk of paying £20 here and there for sandbags, and one person was charged £60 for two. An elderly woman paid £80. 'She just wanted to try and save her home, I guess - and you pay what it takes.' Police were called in yesterday to observe as several tonnes of sand were rationed out to hundreds of weary homeowners who waited for up to four hours in the rain. Today the sand has been limited to no more than six bags per household - where yesterday others were filling recycling bins. Mother-of-one Katie Hyman, 29, who has lived in the community all her life, described the looting as 'disgusting'. 'Grief capitalists': People living in Egham, Surrey, pictured, have hit out at 'gried capitalists', who have been charging over the odds for stolen sandbags, targeting vulnerable people . She said: 'How can you look at someone who is going through heartbreak and steal from them? 'How can you make money out of someone else who is suffering? It's terrible.' Much of the sand has been donated by the Khalsa Aid Sikh community group in nearby Slough. Jo Perandin, who has coordinated the Thames Flood crisis group of volunteers - which has converted a church hall into a makeshift office and aid dispatch centre - said: 'Khalsa have given us nearly 100 tonnes of sand. 'We cannot thank them enough. Nothing is too much trouble for them. They've really come to our need and we're so grateful.' Around 1,000 people in Surrey have been evacuated since the flood water surged, with reports of up to 20 people staying in the same house in order to seek refuge locally. Flood victims in Dorset have hit out at their local council, claiming townhall officials tried to charge them £7.50 for a single sandbag. Homeowners called Christchurch Borough Council for help, fearing their riverside flats were about to be submerged for a second time in a month. But they were told they would have to pay £30 for four sandbags. Shocked: Paul Richards said it is 'disgraceful' that his local council is trying to charge residents for sandbags to protect their homes . Working out it would take 500 bags to protect their homes, the group faced a bill of £3,750. The Conservative council's policy goes against government orders that local authorities should not be charging residents for sandbags. And it flies in the face of Prime Minister David Cameron's repeated statements that 'money is no object' when it comes to local council's dealing with floods. Paul Richards, 61, a retired undertaker, said: 'We have been requesting sandbags from the council to protect the building after our block was flooded downstairs last time. 'Our local councillor said that the council had no sandbags available and no money for the sandbags. 'She said they have FloodSax available for £7.50 each but considering we need at least 500, that is an awful lot of money. 'I was absolutely shocked. It's disgraceful. 'We all pay council tax and surely there is a duty of care from the council that they have to provide us with. Affected: Eric Matthews is among the residents angry at Christchurch Borough Council in Dorset. The council said sandbags are available for emergencies and for residents whose homes are at risk of imminent flooding . 'We've tried repeatedly over the past seven weeks to get some help, we're in a desperate position now and we need the most basic help.' Steve Richards, whose dad Ken was evacuated from his ground floor last month, said: 'You switch on the TV and the Prime Minister is saying things like money is no object but clearly it is.' Brandon Lewis MP, minister for local government, today said: 'There is no reason whatsoever for a council to charge for sandbags.' Yet on its website, Christchurch council state that in times of flooding they do offer the free provision of sandbags to residential properties. Neil Farmer, strategic director at the council, said: 'We do have sandbags available for appropriate use when an emergency is called and these will be made available. 'It is neither reasonable nor practicable to provide an unlimited supply of sandbags to properties which have not been identified as at risk of imminent flooding. 'The council is committed to working with the residents in submitting the appropriate application to the Environment Agency for a flood relief scheme. 'This was declined by former residents in 1979.'","Residents in Datchet, Berkshire have set up a rota to guard sandbags .

Joe Scarborough earns $99,038 a week from his morning show, but his ex-wife will only see a 'tiny fraction' of it, according to the couple's divorce documents. The MSNBC Morning Joe host will not be required to pay child support for their two young children and his alimony payments will be minimal, reports TMZ. The revelations come after news broke Thursday that Scarborough, 50, had quietly filed for divorce from his wife of 12 years Susan Waren in September last year. Over: Joe Scarborough married his second wife . Susan Waren in 2001 and their separation proceedings began last fall . before being finalized in January . According to TMZ, the former Florida congressman gave Waren a once-off payment of $150,000 following the split. He will now be required to pay her $30,000 a month for the next five years, then $25,000 per month for two years. Scarborough is also paying off the couple's home in Connecticut as well as for their children Kate, 10, and five-year-old Jack's education. The divorce was kept very quiet as the legal separation papers were filed last year, but news of the spilt was not made public until this week. Scarborough and Waren finalised the divorce in January of this year in Connecticut and a source told The Huffington Post that he is described as a ‘faithful, devoted and committed father and husband’ in the legal filings. Support: Susan Waren (seen here as a guest) has appeared on her husband's show talking about her charity work . The pair are said to still be living together with their children, and allegedly have 'house rules' when they are both in their Connecticut home. Neither Scarborough or Waren are allowed to enter each other's bedrooms, unless there is a problem related to their children, reports TMZ. They also each have their own side of the house, and after 7pm each night they are prohibited from crossing onto the other's side. No sign of a split: Susan is pictured here on July 18 of this summer, was smiling and still wearing her wedding ring . Scarborough has two sons from his first marriage, Joey and Andrew, who are both in their 20s. He has made no public statements about the split. Part of the reason the separation and divorce went unnoticed was that Scarborough continued to wear his wedding ring on television through the summer, even after everything was finalized in January. The divorce revelation leaked just one day after the NY Post revealed that Joe and his MSNBC cohost Mika Brzezinski are in talks to take over Weekend Today's Sunday show on NBC. United front: Joe is pictured here on September 26, 2013 on the set of his show still wearing his wedding ring as well . The pair almost left MSNBC two years ago to take over CBS's morning show. Shared interests: Joe was a Republican congressman from Florida earlier in his career and Susan worked for Jeb Bush . After nearly four years hosting a primetime show, Scarborough debuted as the host of the eponymous Morning Joe in May of 2007. Mika, a married mother with two daughters, was officially hired as his cohost soon after. News of Joe's divorce comes twelves years after he and Susan married in October 2001. She had worked as an aide to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. The family first moved north from Florida to the Upper West Side for his job at MSNBC, and then several years ago settled in Connecticut, where the paperwork was filed. Months before his wedding he resigned from Congress early in his fourth term as a Republican from Florida, citing his need to be home in Pensacola with his children. He was divorced from his first wife Melanie at the time but the pair shared joint custody of their then young sons. ‘The . realisation has come home to me that they're at a critical stage of . their lives and I would rather be judged at the end of my life as a . father than as a congressman,’ he said. First wife: Mela nie Hinton was Scarborough's first wife and college sweetheart. They divorced in 1999 and shared joint custody. The two boys are both now in their 20s . Older boys: Joey (left) and Andrew (right) Scarborough are Joe's sons from his first marriage . Scarborough has spoken about his second son Andrew’s struggles with both juvenile diabetes and Asperger’s. In 2008 he shared the very premature birth of his son Jack and his road to health with viewers. He dedicates his Twitter bio to his role as a father: ‘Daddy to Kate & Jack, ATM to Joey & Andrew.’ First elected to Congress in 1994, he was . an unknown Republican in a historically Democratic district. He was . reelected three times before leaving. Working partners: Scarborough hosts his MSNBC show Morning Joe alongside Mika Brzezinski (seen here in May 2012) Before he ran for Congress and again when he left, before taking a job at MSNBC, Scarborough worked as a lawyer. He and first wife Melanie Hinton, his college sweetheart from the University of Alabama, wed in 1986. They then moved to Gainesville, where he attended the University of Florida law school, and then settled in Pensacola, where he ran for office. Their divorce was finalised in 1999.","Joe Scarborough 'quietly divorced' wife of 12 years .

Olympic skiier Gus Kenworthy has been reunited with a family of dogs that he found in Sochi during the Games but revealed that a second pup died since arriving in the United States on Wednesday. Kenworthy appeared on the Today Show Friday morning with his friend Robin Macdonald and three of the dogs- Mama, Jake and Mishka. When the silver medalist slopeskiier first met the dogs during the Olympic Games, there were three others in the mix, and though it was announced that one died earlier this week just days before the crew headed back to America, another died since then. Bringing the dogs home: Gus Kenworthy and his friend Robin Macdonald spoke to Matt Lauer and Tamron Hall about the grueling process of trying to get the family of dogs back to the states with their legal papers . The pup called Sochi died before Macdonald left Russia, and it is unclear which of the two others- Stryder or Rosa- died since then. 'It was a lot more difficult than we thought it would be,' Kenworthy said on Today. He said how Macdonald, a friend of his who was working as a photographer at the Games, agreed to stay on in Russia after the Games to allow time for the legal paperwork to go through, but ended up staying longer than predicted. 'We expected him to be there two or three extra days and he was there for a month,' Kenworthy said. Adorable: Jake (left) and Mishka (right) were very calm throughout the interview . Spooked: Today Show host Tamron Hall got nervous when she heard that the dogs have not been potty trained . Big debut: Kenworthy, who won a silver medal in slopestyle skiing, and Macdonald have been regularly updating their Twitter accounts with photos of the dogs . 'We encountered some government roadblocks when we were there. A politician claimed that (the dogs) were his,' Macdonald said. During the legal squabbling, Macdonald was unable to get the dogs the medical treatment that they needed to treat their malnourishment and other threats to life. The plight of strays in Russia gained an international audience during the Olympics as thousands of dogs roamed the streets and interacted with the tourists. 'One of the strange things in Sochi is they're very friendly and people feed them and take care of them- they just don't bring them into their homes,' Macdonald said. Before the worst: Since this Tweet was posted on Wednesday, one of the five dogs died . Bath time: He shared this photo of Mishka and Jake getting a rinse down on Thursday, the day before the Today Show appearance . Now the dogs that made it back alive are headed for homes of their own. In earlier interviews, 22-year-old Kenworthy said that he would be taking Rosa and another dog, Mama- the mother of the clan- will go to Kenworthy's mother, and another will be going to Kenworthy's brother's family. Kenworthy said that they worked with Humane Society International to get the paperwork and medical testing done and now have hopes of establishing easier ways for future visitors to Russia to adopt strays from abroad, giving future World Cups and Games as times when may be convenient. Too soon: Gus Kenworthy's would-be adopted dog 'Sochi', seen here with Kenworthy's friend Robin Macdonald, died on March 9 ahead of the scheduled trip back to the US . Puppy love: Kenworthy brought some social media attention to the stray dogs in Sochi after posing for pictures with them during the Games . Macdonald posted photos of the dog's crates on Wednesday showing them at the airport on their way back to the U.S. He later updated that all five of his travel companions made it through the flight, though only three appeared on Today and they confirmed that one had died since Wednesday. The pups have resulted in a great deal of attention for Kenworthy, the 22-year-old who helped the U.S. sweep the slopestyle event with his silver contribution. He credited Macdonald with being the one to alert him to the particularly photogenic stray family. 'There were a lot of strays there, but the [ones that I adopted] were living outside the media center. My friend Robin who was out there doing media stuff during the Games saw them and sent me a photo of them because he knows Iâ€™m obsessed with dogs,' Kenworthy told Elle.","Kenworthy and his friend Robin Macdonald brought three of the dogs to the Today Show this morning .

Pundits across the country are lambasting those who have treated the Trayvon Martin case as a means to exploiting other issues – especially the far right. Joe Scarborough of MSNBC’s Morning Joe was outraged that some extreme conservatives are treating the teen’s death as a means to pushing their own agendas. ‘This has nothing to do with gun rights. This has nothing to do with the Second Amendment,’ he said on Morning Joe today. ‘This has nothing to do with Stand Your Ground Laws…This has everything to do with a guy that’s trying to play security cop who was unhinged, who chased down and shot a 17-year-old kid, armed with Skittles and iced tea.’ Carpet-bagging: On Morning Joe, host Joe Scarborough said it's 'disgusting' that the right is using the Trayvon Martin case as a political platform . Blame game: William Bennett, who worked under George H.W. Bush, said people are trying to profit personally and politically from Martin's death . Scarborough condemned those on the right who, as he said, were using the case of Trayvon Martin to get ahead politically. He said: ‘Some of these guys on the right are jumping in with both feet on the far right…they are trashing Trayvon Martin. It’s disgusting.’ But in a case where everyone from Spike Lee to President Obama have commented, it’s a difficult issue to navigate. ‘It’s innocuous at best,’ Scarborough said on the MSNBC show, labeling those trying to make Trayvon Martin’s death a political issue are ‘fools.’ Solidarity: Civilians and celebrities alike have jumped upon wearing hoodies to support Trayvon . Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly took the opposite stance, saying on The O’Reilly factor Thursday that pundits shouldn’t be so quick to pass judgment. Arlene Holt Baker, who is the Executive Vice President for the American Federation of Labour-Congress of Industrial Organisations, said that ‘conservative, right-wing policies’ are to blame for Martin’s death. 'Some of these guys on the right are jumping in with both feet on the far right... they are trashing Trayvon Martin. It's disgusting.' -Joe Scarborough . Ms Baker told The Daily Caller that . conservative think tank ALEC – the American Legislative Exchange Council . – is to blame for Florida’s ‘Stand Your Ground’ law. William Bennett cited the hysteria surrounding the case as a worrying symptom. In a CNN editorial, the former George H.W. Bush staffer wrote that many seem eager to jump to conclusions. Mr Bennett wrote: ‘Many people are not on an impartial hunt for justice, but are exploiting this crisis for personal or political gain and claiming that it is representative of larger societal problems.’ As the Christian Science Monitor noted, details of the case are being released slowly, and often in a point-counterpoint fashion. At the centre: Trayvon Martin's parents, father, Tracy Martin, left, and mother Sybrina Fulton, have been pushed into the limelight after their son's death . Jumping to conclusions: Bill Bennett said that some people are using this case to add fuel to the fire, carpet-bagging any number of causes or issues . First, the funeral director who handled Trayvon’s body said there were no injuries that would suggest a fight. Next, Zimmerman’s brother Robert Zimmerman Jr. said he’s a stand-out man, and a ‘neighbour everyone would want to have.’ Mr Bennett said: ‘The people raising the most noise are trying to make this less about the horrible death of a young man and more about claims of racial resentment that may or may not exist.’ He pointed out that while Zimmerman may or may not be guilty, many are jumping to conclusions and carpet-bagging on a tragic incident.","Morning Joe host said far right's carpet-bagging on tragedy is 'disgusting'

Injury: A man was taken to hospital after being hit on the head by this NHS advert saying 'Feeling under the weather?' The solid wood sign, which advises people to see their GP if they are 'feeling under the weather', was attached to the outside of a pharmacist, the Leicester Mercury reported. The man had noticed that it was flapping about in winds which reached nearly 60mph, and went into the shop to inform the owner. Witnesses said that as the pair were standing outside the sign came loose and crashed down onto the man, narrowly missing the shopkeeper. 'As the two of them were standing there it came down and hit him - it missed her by inches,' a bystander told the Mercury. 'She was very shaken afterwards and very lucky, too.'

Miami Heat star LeBron James insists his poor display in the defeat by the San Antonio Spurs was due to the new short-sleeved jerseys in favour in the NBA. James was successful with just six of his 18 attempts during the Heat's 111-87 defeat by the Spurs, his second-worst shooting night of the season.

The short-sleeved jerseys were introduced to the NBA this season and are flying off the shelves of stores as they are very popular with fans, reports ESPN. James is not a fan of the jerseys and told reporters that it affects his long range shots. James alluded to a game on Christmas Day when he wore one of the short-sleeved jerseys and shot 0-of-4 from a 3-point-range in a game with the Los Angeles Lakers. Thursday was a night of mishaps for LeBron who later took off the plastic mask he wears to protect his broken nose because it 'bothered him.' 'I don't like it,' James said.

As for the short sleeved jerseys, LeBron wasn't the only player to complain about the restrictive style. However, the NBA disputes that shooting percentages are the same regardless of whether a person is wearing a short sleeved jersey or not. 'We know that shooting percentages are virtually exactly the same for games in which we have sleeved jerseys and teams in which the guys are wearing conventional jerseys,' NBA commissioner Adam Silver said over All-Star Weekend. 'So I'm pretty comfortable from a competitive standpoint that it's having no impact.' James is done wearing the short sleeved Jerseys this season and is pretty thrilled about it but knows there will be a game in the future for which he'll have to wear the Jersey.

She allegedly hired a former Detroit Lions player Chris Geile as a hit man to kill the competitor. He has not been arrested or charged and denies involvement.

Jade Etherington and guide Caroline Powell crowned their first season racing together by winning Great Britain's first Paralympic medal on snow in 20 years in Sochi. The pair, who a year ago had never even met, were doing only their third competitive downhill run together and marked the occasion by claiming silver. It got Britain's Winter Paralympics off to a flying start and ensured that less than an hour into day one they had already exceeded their medal haul from four years ago in Vancouver. The pair became the first British women ever to win a Paralympic skiing medal, their rise all the more remarkable given how little time they had to build a partnership. It was only last April that they first got to know each other, August they first skied competitively together and January this year they first competed as a pair in a downhill. The duo did not even get a training run on Friday because the session was cancelled, but Etherington said: 'I actually was really happy there was no training run, because personally I feel if you're going to be scared for your life you might as well get a result at the end of it.' And the Lincoln athlete did just that, finishing in one minute 34.28 seconds, 2.73secs behind Slovakian winner Henrieta Farkasova. She crashed as she crossed the line, but was unhurt, with the medal joy more than making up for the bruises. 'We had a good run despite my crash at the end. I think I was just so happy to go through the line that I couldn't stop in time. I was aiming for the finish line, saying ""go, go, go"" and listening to Caroline. I hope I have done GB proud,' she told BBC Radio 5 Live. Ouch: Etherington crashed at the finishing line but was OK . Shocking: But fearless Etherington wasn't worried about any potential penalties .

Flying star: Etherington was back on her feet and on the podium with guide Caroline Powell (left) 'I was so happy I'd finished and then couldn't stop I was going that fast,' she said. Her achievement drew praise from Prime Minister David Cameron, who Tweeted: 'Proud of Jade Etherington, who won silver in the women's visually impaired downhill in Sochi. #GoParalympicsGB.' Etherington, who celebrates her 23rd birthday on Sunday, is visually impaired and communicates with Powell down the course via radio. She admitted she was surprised by how quickly the duo had flourished. Powell, who is 19, added: 'It's basically a friendship so you have to build a friendship and that can take years. 'In our case we had to build it within a short space of time, but we were really honest with each other from the beginning. 'She taught me so much about guiding, I just went with what she said and it's worked. It's come together now and we're so happy.' And things should only get better over the coming week, with four more events to come, including the super-G, in which Etherington won bronze at last year's IPC World Championships, with a different guide. High praise: Prime Minister David Cameron congratulated Etherington on Twitter . Ace: Etherington, along with her guide Caroline Powell, managed a silver medal in Sochi . Birthday girl: The silver medallist will celebrate on Sunday . Job done: Etherington was delighted with her triumph and hoped she'd done Britain proud . Team-mate Kelly Gallagher and guide Charlotte Evans were also grateful for four more chances after they could only manage sixth place. Evans, who was in tears, said: 'I am the blubbering wreck, but our communication was awesome and we have no excuse. You can see my disappointment, but we will come back fighting.' Gutted: Kelly Gallagher was devastated after finishing in sixth . Disappointment: GB sit-skier Anna Turney crashed out on the 'bumpy course' Great Britain have not won a Winter Paralympics medal on since the Lillehammer Games in 1994. James Barker, Richard Burt, Matthew Stockford and Peter Young won individual bronze medals in alpine skiing categories. Sit-skier Anna Turney also suffered disappointment after crashing out on the 'bumpy course'. 'I think I got the line slightly wrong, it was so bumpy and I just popped out,"" said Turney, who was unhurt. 'I wanted to win, it just wasn't my day. It is challenging snow and it is bumpy in places, certainly where I crashed that was bumpy. Spectacular: American Tyler Walker crashed on the run later in the day and had to be airlifted to hospital . Ouch: Walker is carried down the slope by medical staff in Sochi . 'I don't think it was unsafe, but it was definitely challenging. This is an extreme downhill.' 'Everyone was like, 'It's so dangerous', but it's a downhill.' The course, which has come in for criticism in the build-up for its ""slushy snow"", did appear to deteriorate as the day went on, though.

Expectant mothers in New Jersey can choose to block their baby's father from the delivery room after a landmark court ruling on privacy rights. Details of the ruling were released this week, but the case was heard last year when Steven Plotnick sued his ex-fiancée Rebecca DeLucciato to make her inform him when she went into labor. Arguments in the case were heard up to the very last moment, with DeLucciato giving statements during a telephone conference as she had the baby. Scroll down for video . Ruling: A judge says pregnant women have a right to exclude a baby's father from the delivery room . In their prenatel court battle - though to be the first of its kind - Plotnick wanted to ensure he would be told when his ex-fiancée had gone into labor, and that she would grant him access to see his baby at the hospital as soon as possible. The couple had separated before their planned wedding last year, but Plotnick was determined to be a part of his baby's life. When he ruled on the case in November last year Superior Court Judge Sohail Mohammed . said all patients, especially pregnant women, had privacy rights that allow them to decide who can be at their bedside. The judge referred to two landmark Supreme Court abortion rulings - Roe v Wade from 1973 and Planned Parenthood v Casey in 1992 - to determine his case, stating that they show a woman has a stronger right over her body and unborn child than the baby's father. 'Any interest a father has before the child’s birth is subordinate to the mother’s interests. Even when there is no doubt that a father has shown deep and proper concern and interest in the growth and development of the fetus,' the judge wrote. He added that by being at the birth, the father would have access to medical information about the mother that she may not want to share. Hearing: Superior Court Judge Sohail Mohammed, pictured in 2011, made the ruling in November last year . The ruling has been criticized by fathers' rights groups, who say it demotes the role of a man as being nothing more than a pay check. Jeff Golden, of Fathers & Children’s Equality, told CBS Philadelphia: 'It’s a sad day for fathers, and for father's and men’s rights. 'The way we look at it is a child is born, a child had two parents and they should be two equal parents.' DeLuccia's attorney, Joanna Brick, told NJ.com: 'They were estranged from one another at the time delivery was approaching, for quite some time. They weren’t communicating more than a little text here or there.' Brick said the case came to its conclusion as DeLuccia was in the delivery room, where she later gave birth to a baby girl. She added that the mother had planned to provide him access to the baby, but as a hospital visitor. The father's attorney, Laura Nunnink, said her client never asked to be in the delivery room but had wanted to see his baby as soon as possible. 'He wanted to be a very involved father from the instant his child was born. It was important that he have the right to bond just as the mother would,' she said. Plotnick does not plan to appeal the ruling and was able to see his daughter shortly after she was born.","Steven Plotnick sued his ex-girlfriend last year to make her tell him when she went into labor .

Despite many Americans continuing to struggle due to tight economic circumstances, the number of millionaires in the U.S. has never been higher with more than 9.6 million living the good life. Although the recession in 2008 caused the number of millionaires to drop drastically to only 6.7 million, a bullish stock market in recent years has led to a rebound in the ranks of the rich, according to the Spectrem Group, a research and consulting firm in the wealth and retirement industry. The previous record for most American millionaires was in 2008 when it reached 9.2 million, before the recession hit. Between 2012 and 2013 alone, the number of millionaires rose by 600,000. And in 2003, the figure stood at 6.2 million. More than 9.6 million Americans are millionaires and 1,240,000 Americans have a net worth of $5 million or more . 'Most of the financial damage done by the recession has been erased by recent record-high markets in 2013 as well as continued rebound in the real estate markets,” Spectrem President George H. Walper Jr. said. 'In terms of the affluent investor, it is fair to say they have finally recovered from the economic downturn.' According to Spectrem's Affluent Market Insight's Report for 2014, the number of the super rich — those with a net worth of $25 million or more — also reached new height as that number stands at 132,000.

Hillary Clinton has compared Vladimir Putin's decision to have Russian troops invade Crimea to a tactic used by the Nazis in the lead up to the second World War. The former Secretary of State said that by using the guise of protecting the minority of native Russians living in the Ukraine, Putin has taken an approach that was used by Adolf Hitler in order to help him encroach on neighboring countries. 'Now if this sounds familiar, it’s what Hitler did back in the 30s,' Clinton said at an event in Long Beach, California on Tuesday. Looking back: Hillary Clinton said that Putin's tactics in saying that he is protecting the Russian minority in the Ukraine are similar to those used by Hitler when he began to annex neighboring countries in Europe . 'All the Germans that were ... the ethnic Germans, the Germans by ancestry who were in places like Czechoslovakia and Romania and other places, Hitler kept saying they’re not being treated right. ""I must go and protect my people"" and that’s what’s gotten everybody so nervous.' Hitler's policy was called 'Heim ins Reich', or 'Home into the Empire', and led to the Nazis annexing portions of Austria, Poland and Czechoslovakia to be 'returned' to Germany after their troops were granted entrance to the areas under the guise of helping German nationals in the outside territories. In a similar vein, Putin recently issued Russian passports to any Ukrainians with ties to Russia, which many saw as a way to lay his claims for entry. 'Putin is trying to assert his power in a way that is dangerous,' Clinton said. According to Fox News, she went on to say that Putin is a person 'who believes his mission is to restore Russian greatness... When he looks at Ukraine, he sees a place that he believes is by its very nature part of Mother Russia.' Plan of attack: President Vladimir Putin has issued Russian passports to any people with Russian descent who live in the Ukraine so he has justification to enter the country to 'protect' Russian citizens . In shambles: The political situation in the Ukraine remains uncertain and a memorial has been set up where nearly 100 anti government protesters were killed in Kiev's Independence Square . This is not the first time that Mrs Clinton has blasted the Russian leader. Politico reported she jokingly said during the 2008 presidential campaign that 'he was a KGB agent. By definition, he doesn't have a soul'. Tuesday's talk was just the latest paid speech that the former Secretary of State has made in recent weeks, this time speaking at a private event held at the Long Beach Boys and Girls Club. Her comments were not released publicly but an audience member told Buzzfeed that she praised the work of her successor, John Kerry, who arrived in Kiev on Tuesday to help assess the ongoing crisis. Kerry's trip coincided with Washington's approval of a $1billion aid package to the Ukraine, which came ahead of the European Union's own package of $15billion. He has since traveled to Paris and is scheduled to speak with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. She went on to say that the situation in Crimea is 'a real nail-biter, right now, but nobody wants to up the rhetoric. Everybody wants to cool it in order to find a diplomatic solution and that’s what we should be trying to do.' Ready for talks: Secretary of State John Kerry has arrived in Paris ahead of talks scheduled for Wednesday with the Russian foreign minister .","The former Secretary of State said that Putin is copying Hitler's move of entering neighboring countries under the guise of protecting his citizens .

Marc Cohn, a Grammy Award-winning songwriter, and the 20/20 anchor has been married since 2002 but it was reported that he may have had an affair with another woman- the couple's mutual friend Ruth Zuckerman- after he was spotted having dinner with her shortly after Vargas returned to Manhattan from rehab. 'I have no comment regarding vicious rumors about a so-called “affair,”' he told MailOnline through a spokesperson. Together: Elizabeth Vargas and her husband Marc Cohn (seen here in 2012) have been married since 2002 and he denied allegedly having an affair while she was in rehab for alcohol addiction . Friend or foe: The affair was reported when a friend spotted Cohn having dinner with he and Elizabeths' mutual friend Ruth Zuckerman, one of the founders of Flywheel Sports spin studios . 'I have encouraged and supported Elizabeth's recovery as her years of struggle have been hard on everyone. Out of deference to my family's privacy, I will not comment further.' Sources have confirmed to MailOnline that Vargas and Cohn are still living together and have not separated, but his side suggested that it is because he wants to remain as 'a stabilizing force for both Elizabeth and the children'. Adding to the love triangle is the fact that both Vargas and Cohn were friends with Zuckerman, the divorced head of Flywheel Sports, ahead of the alleged affair. They met her by taking spinning classes at her workout chain. Unidentified sources told MailOnline that in spite of the allegations, Cohn and Vargas are still living together and have not separated. Opening up: Vargas spoke on The View in February about her recovery and how her husband was the one to alert her to a dependency problem . The source also said that they never separated and were still a couple both during and after Vargas' treatment in spite of the reports that a friend spotted Cohn having dinner with Zuckerman near the Flywheel outpost in Manhattan's Flatiron district at some point after her treatment ended. Vargas left the treatment program in mid-November and then gave several interviews when she returned to work in January. A different friend told The New York Post said that Cohn and Zuckerman had been more than friends for more than just one meal. 'It was disgusting that he was with Ruth while Elizabeth was in rehab,' the source told The Post. Legal definitions: Friends of Cohn, known best for his hit 'Walking in Memphis', said that he has not moved out or ended his relationship with Vargas. Zuckerman, right, is divorced . Friends of the 'Walking in Memphis' singer denied that anything untoward happened in the first place and said that Cohn and Vargas had separated but MailOnline's sources denied that any a split had ever happened. Cohn, 54, and Vargas, 51, were introduced by Andre Agassi at the U.S. Open in 1999. They dated for three years before getting married in 2002 and Vargas gave birth to their first son Zachary six months later. Their second son Sam was born in 2006. During her post-treatment interviews, Vargas said that her husband was the one who encouraged her to get help for her alcohol dependency.

The baby was rushed to North Bay Medical Centre, where doctors found part of his nose had been completely severed and he had a possible head trauma. The baby was transferred to Oakland's Children's Hospital, where medical teams determined one third of the child's nose had been ripped off and that he had a fractured skull and a brain hemorrhage.

Former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown has announced that his daughter is engaged to one of his ex-staffers. 'Big news in the Brown Family!  Arianna  and Jimmy got engaged today!! They grow up so fast Gail and I are so happy for them!' the Republican announced via Twitter. This isn't the first time that Brown has made his daughter's personal lives public information, as he infamously said that they were 'available' during his 2010 acceptance speech. Happy news: Scott Brown announced that his younger daughter Arianna (center left in yellow) is engaged (pictured alongside his wife Gail and elder daughter Ayla (right) in 2010 at the White House Correspondent's Dinner . Rising profile: Even though he was voted out of office in 2012 (seen here at a re-election rally with Senator John McCain, daughters Ayla at center right and Arianna at right), Brown is trying to re-bolster his public image . Arianna Brown has been dating Jim Hendry, both 23, since he worked in his Senate office. New member of the family: Jim Hendry proposed to Arianna this weekend, though they will be waiting at least a year to marry . Now he works at the Department of Justice as Arianna is training to become a vetrinarian. The proposal took place over this weekend, and according to The Boston Herald, the former Senator was in on the plan. During a recent visit to Washington, Brown spent time with Hendry who said that he was 'working hard, I'm saving up money and paying back my school loans'. The next day, Hendry said that he was also saving up for a ring for Arianna and Brown gave him his blessing, but he still made him wait a few days before formally giving him the go-ahead. Since graduating from Syracuse University in 2012 and putting her modelling days behind her, Arianna has led a fairly private life. Her father is the one to update his growing mass of supporters on her latest news, and in July that came in the form of a hospital visit. 'In DC with Arianna. She got bit by a nasty cat at her vet job. Got infected, in the hospital in VA since Monday. Had an operation last night to scrape, irrigate, tendon and bone. Unreal. Think we are past the danger,' he wrote on his Facebook page. Brown has been growing his public fan base since being voted out of office last year, with speculation mounting that he may be trying to launch a presidential campaign in 2016. A way with animals: Arianna, seen here with her father and their dog Koda, is training to be a veterinarian and had a run in with an infected cat bite earlier this summer that sent her to the hospital . Proud dad: Brown previously got in trouble for joking during his 2010 acceptance speech that both of his daughters were single, but that is no longer the case . The clearest indication that he is trying to boost his national profile is by attending the Iowa State Fair this past weekend with his wife Gail. Though the state fair is a family-friendly event, it is also a breeding ground for political fodder since Iowa plays such a pivotal role in the early primary elections. 'I want to get an indication of whether there’s even an interest, in Massachusetts and throughout the country, if there’s room for a bi-partisan problem solver,' he told The Herald on Sunday. 'It’s 2013 -- I think it’s premature, but I am curious.'

The head of the Senate Intelligence Committee has accused the CIA of spying on their internal computer network during their searches about how the agency used torture during Bush-era terror investigations. The shocking allegations were made by Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who publicly aired her grievances on the Senate floor on Tuesday. CIA director John Brennan has since denied the claims during an interview later that day, but he didn’t shy away from complaining about Senator Feinstein’s behavior. Airing her grievances: Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Senator Dianne Feinstein accused the CIA of improperly searching a network of computers designed for Congress . Brennan said the agency was not trying to stop the committee's report and that it had not hacked into Senate computers. He . said the appropriate authorities would look at the matter further and . ‘I defer to them to determine whether or not there was any violation of . law or principle.’ Feinstein . said the matter has been referred to the Justice Department for further . investigation. She said she had ‘grave concerns that the CIA's search . may well have violated the separation of powers principles embodied in . the U.S. Constitution.’ The . CIA provided computers to congressional staffers in a secure room in . northern Virginia in 2009 so the panel could review millions of pages of . top secret documents in the course of its investigation into the CIA's . detentions and interrogations during the Bush administration. At . issue now is whether the CIA violated an agreement made with the Senate . Intelligence Committee about monitoring the panel's use of CIA . computers. When asked about the ongoing battle of he-said, she-said, the White House sided with the CIA but did not expand into details. 'White House’s perspective on this is reflected in the fact that we  support the declassification of the findings of the report,' Jay Carney said at a Tuesday afternoon press conference. Feinstein said . the Senate staff members had an electronic search tool to deal with 6.2 . million pages of documents and the ability to make copies on their . computers. She said the arrangement suffered a blow when CIA personnel . electronically removed the committee's access to documents that had . already been provided to the panel. Denial: CIA Director John Brennan said that the agency 'was in no way spying' on the Congressional committee in question or the Senate . She . said about 870 documents were removed in February 2010, and an . additional 50 were withdrawn without the knowledge of the committee. Feinstein said she has asked the agency for an apology but the CIA has been silent. Director . Brennan, who first told Feinstein about the surveillance of the Senate . investigation that occurred before he took over the CIA, had no . immediate comment on the senator's statement. The . dispute comes as the Obama administration is trying to regain public . trust after classified details about widespread surveillance of . Americans were disclosed by former National Security Agency systems . analyst Edward Snowden last summer. This . dispute does not involve the NSA spying on Americans, but it does show a . fractious relationship between the U.S. spy agencies and the Congress . charged with overseeing them. Feinstein, . as head of the Intelligence panel, has defended the NSA against . criticism of its practices, making her comments about the CIA dispute . highly unusual. Senators said the stakes demanded it. Public stage: Senator Feinstein spoke about the alleged searches of the materials on the use of torture during the Bush administration on the Senate floor Tuesday after having two prior private requests ignored . ‘If . we do not stand up for the protection of the separation of powers and . our ability to do oversight, especially when conduct has happened that . is all likelihood criminal conduct on the part of a government agency, . then what do we stand for?’ asked Vermont’s Democratic Senator Patrick . Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Saying . she wanted to set the record straight amid various published reports . and rampant speculation, Feinstein said the CIA searched the computer . network in January and she had pressed Brennan about the agency's . actions and the legal basis for its search. She said she had not received any answers despite letters sent on January 17 and January 23. Feinstein . said the CIA's inspector general, David Buckley, has referred the . matter to the Justice Department ‘given the possibility of a criminal . violation by CIA personnel.’ In . further evidence of the escalating fight, Feinstein said that after the . inspector general's referral, the acting counsel of the CIA filed a . criminal report with the Justice Department regarding the committee . staff's actions. Feinstein defended the staff as professionals with appropriate security clearances. Supporting the Senator: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Senator Patrick Leahy agreed with Feinstein, who claimed the CIA's searches undermined the separation of powers under the Constitution . ‘I . view the acting counsel general's referral as a potential effort to . intimidate this staff, and I am not taking it lightly,’ she said. Brennan, . who was questioned at an appearance on another subject, said ‘We are . not in any way, shape or form trying to thwart this report.’ ‘I am confident that the authorities will deal with this appropriately,’ he said. ‘I . would just encourage some members of the Senate to take their time, to . make sure they don't overstate what they claim and what they apparently . believe to be the truth.’ Democrats . on the Senate Intelligence Committee completed their 6,300-page . interrogation report last year and are revising it with CIA comments. Feinstein said she would ask the White House to declassify its . 300-plus-page executive summary, and its conclusions. When . the report was first approved by Democrats on the committee in December . 2012, Feinstein said her staffers came to the conclusion that the . detention and interrogation program yielded little or no significant . intelligence.","Senator Dianne Feinstein blasted the CIA for allegedly tracking Congressional computer network searches .

Former U.S. Ambassador Elizabeth Bagley, who was appointed to her post in Portugal by Hillary’s husband Bill Clinton in 1994, donated $5,000 to the group. Appealing to high-end donors: Champagne flutes and cocktail napkins are among the varied merchandise . The biggest donations came from Scott Bessent, the CIO of George Soros’ investment firm, who pledged $25,000 to the cause. That 70s Show creator Bonnie Turner followed suit with $10,000 of her own. Political heavyweights have even begun putting their money towards the cause, with American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten donating $1,000. Harold Ickes, a Democratic strategist and head of progressive Priorities USA PAC, donated $2,500 even though his group will likely end up backing Clinton as well. The money will come in handy if Clinton formally announces her (widely presumed) candidacy as the latest polls have her as the clear leader of the Democratic field. The latest RealClearPolitics poll average for the Iowa Democratic caucus has Clinton 55 points ahead of the field, which includes Vice President Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Governor Andrew Cuomo.","The PAC, which isn't officially endorsed by Clinton, is now selling merchandise online .

Dottie Sandusky has branded the boys who accused her husband of molesting them as money-hungry liars as she opened up in her first on-camera interview since the 2012 scandal. 'I think they were manipulated. Once lawyers came into the case they thought there was money,' she said of the multiple young boys who accused her husband Jerry of sexual abuse. 'I think people need to know that Jerry is not guilty. You can see all the discrepancies in the trial,' she told The Today Show's Matt Lauer. 'I believe he showered with kids and that’s the generation that Jerry grew up in.' Maintaining innocence: Dottie Sandusky said that her husband never sexually assaulted young boys even though he was found guilty on 45 counts of sex abuse and is now spending his life in prison . 'Rough time': Mrs Sandusky said that her family has been extremely supportive- with the exception of her adopted son Matt who was going to testify that Jerry sexually assaulted him as a teen . Her husband is now serving between 30 and 60 years in prison after being found guilty of 45 counts relating to child molestation. The former Penn State assistant football coach was accused of inappropriately touching the boys both in the locker room showers and in a basement bedroom in the Sandusky's Pennsylvania home. In the trial testimony, at least one of the boys said that he was screaming for help when Jerry molested him in the basement, and he hoped that Dottie would come to his aid because he knew that she was in the house. Dottie, who was never criminally charged herself, showed Lauer the bedroom where the boy alleged the abuse took place. In the room: Sandusky showed Today's Matt Lauer the bedroom in the basement where one of the abused children said that he was sexually assaulted by the former football coach . 'There was nothing that went on because I was here I mean I will take you downstairs. It is not a dungeon. It is not what that kid said,' Dottie said. Lauer noted that because of their 'small house', it would be difficult for her not to hear screams. 'Because he didn't scream,' she said. She also defended herself against critics who have called her a weak enabler to allow her husband's years of abuse to continue unabated. 'They called me Sarge because I kept everybody in line,' she said. Teary-eyed: Dottie Sandusky opens up about how prison has changed her husband, former assistant Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky . Behind bars: Sandusky, seen center in October, was found guilty on 45 of 48 counts of child abuse and will spend between 30 and 60 years behind bars- depending on how long he lives . She told about her weekly trips to the maximum security prison where he is living, and how it takes her more than three hours each way to spend just an hour with him. During the day, he is confined to his cell 23 hours every day, and then the remaining hour he is let out in an outdoor ‘cage’ while wearing waist chains and handcuffs- but even that respite depends on the weather. He also makes a weekly trip to the prison’s law library where he is able to spend two hours reviewing other cases in order to help strengthen his appeal case. She said that they talk of his appeal often and he remains very hopeful about his chances of being exonerated. ‘He reads, he meditates her writes he has a TV which is a lifesaver for him,’ she said. ‘I really haven’t seen a whole lot of changes in him. ‘Jerry's still a happy person and he smiles and he tries to make people laugh. He said “I’m in the situation I’m in and I’m going to make the best I can.”’ Opening up: Dottie started to cry when she told how her husband of 46-years wrote to a friend saying that the things he missed most were his grandchildren and doing 'special things with friends' Dottie gave some insight into her husband's life inside the walls of a . maximum security prison. 'A friend had written to him and asked him what he missed, what did he take most for granted?' she said. 'He said family meals, the fun time with the grandkids playing ball, (and) doing special things with friends.' She broke down in tears in the middle of her sentence, pausing to compose herself before continuing. Dottie was the one to bring up their adopted son Matt Sandusky, who was willing to testify for the state prosecutors about . how he underwent seven years of abuse at the hands of his father. He testified in a grand jury investigation that he was not abused by his father but then was planning to recant that testimony during the open court proceedings. Matt spoke about the abuse, and whether or not his father's actions were an . open secret in the football-loving community, in a documentary that . premiered at Sundance Film Festival. Support: Dottie stood by her husband and was at his side during his 2012 trial . During the Today Show interview, Dottie accused him of being a liar and a thief, who not only stole money from their family but also stole her husband's championship rings. She . said that even though they had taken him in for '15, 16, 17' years, he . turned on them and tried to get his siblings to do the same. 'Our . whole kids do not believe him either, he tried to get someone of them . to turn. Money was a motive, he had some financial problems,' she said. One . major inconsistency that was repeated throughout the hour-long . interview, which was posted online in spite of only a fraction of it . being aired on Today, was the amount of time that she has known her . husband. Early on in the interview, Mrs Sandusky said: ‘I have known Jerry for 38 years. We've been married for 37.’ She repeated that at a later point as well. Their side: Dottie was accompanied by documentary film maker John Zeigler who believes that Jerry, Joe Paterno and the Penn State administrators have all been wrongly accused . Those . numbers effectively erase a decade of their relationship: Dottie and . Jerry Sandusky got married in 1966 meaning that they have been a couple . for 47 years. She said as much in a letter to the judge that she wrote in 2012 pleading for a lesser sentence. ‘I . am Dottie Sandusky, Jerry Sandusky's wife of 46 years in September. It . is with a heavy heart I write this to you. I have known Jerry for 47 . years and he has always been truthful with me, even if it hurt,’ she . wrote in the October 2012 letter. The . inconsistency even continued further with Lauer, as he actually read . quotes from the letter and adjusted the number of years to reflect what . Dottie had said earlier in the interview. No explanation was given for the mistake. She . ended her talk by apologizing to the ‘many’ people who had been hurt by . the scandal- specifically citing the Paternos, her children, the Penn . State administrators who lost their jobs and are the subject of their . own criminal investigations- but she chose not to include the young . victims among the injured parties.","Jerry Sandusky's wife of 46-years has shown the bedroom in the basement of their Pennsylvania home where some of the sexual assaults took place .

A nine-year-old boy from North Carolina has been forced to leave his favorite lunch bag at home because his school said it made him a target for bullies. Grayson Bruce had been subjected to taunts and bullying from classmates over the My Little Pony-themed bag. On Thursday, his school asked him to stop bringing in the blue pony-shaped bag because it was a 'trigger for bullying'. Shocked: Noreen Bruce with her son, Grayson, who was told to stop bringing his My Little Pony bag to school because it attracted bullies . Fan: Grayson's lunch bag is based on Rainbow Dash, his favorite character in the popular cartoon . His case comes less than two months after another North Carolina boy, Michael Morones, tried to take his own life after being bullied for his love of the cartoon. Michael, 11, is still recovering in hospital after suffering brain damage from the attempt. Both boys are part of a large male fan-base known as Bronies, who are drawn to the animation-style and moral values promoted in the show. Because they fall out of the show's target demographic, Bronies can find themselves the target of bullies. In Grayson's case, he says he has been pushed and punched because he is a fan of the show. 'They're taking it a little too far, with . punching me, pushing me down, calling me horrible names, stuff that . really shouldn't happen,' he told ABC 13. The bullying became worse when he got a Rainbow Dash themed lunch bag, which is shaped like the blue pony character. Popular: The My Little Pony animated series has a large male fan base, known as Bronies . 'Most of the characters in the show are . girls, and most of the people put it toward girls, most of the toys are . girlie, and surprisingly I found stuff like this,' Grayson said, as he showed off the bag. His defense against attacks that the show is 'girly' because of the animated animal characters has been echoed by other Bronies in the past, who have pointed out other cartoons popular with boys, such as Pokeman, also had cute characters. Grayson's mother, Noreen Bruce, said she was shocked by the school's response to the bullying and wants those involved punished. She was appalled that the school had called his lunch bag a 'trigger for bullying', adding: '[It's] like saying a short skirt is a trigger for rape.' Mrs Bruce also defended the show, saying: 'It's promoting friendship, there's no bad words, there's no violence, it's hard to find that, even in cartoons now.' Teased: Michael Morones, who also lives in North Carolina, is recovering in hospital after trying to take his own life after bullies picked on him because of his love for My Little Pony . Fans of the show have also rallied round the schoolboy, setting up a Support For Grayson page for him on Facebook, which has more than 9,900 likes. Voice actress Tara Strong, who played Twilight Sparkle on the show, also lent her support to Grayson, tweeting: 'Don't worry Grayson, I'll get 'em.' A statement from Buncombe County Schools said: 'An initial step was taken to immediately address a situation that had created a disruption in the classroom. 'Buncombe County Schools takes bullying very seriously, and we will continue to take steps to resolve this issue.' An online petition has been started, calling on the school to 'allow Grayson to bring his backpack to school, and crack down on bullying'.","Grayson Bruce was being teased by classmates for being fan of cartoon .

Tragic: Bradley Eames, 20, became the third victim of the dangerous drinking game after he downed two pints of gin . Schools are tackling the dangerous internet drinking craze of NekNominate by reading out warnings in assemblies and putting up signs on noticeboards. The Local Government Association (LGA) is also urging Twitter and Facebook to introduce warnings over the drinking game, which has been linked to several deaths, councils have said. The organisation, which represents almost 400 councils in England and Wales, said prominent messages were needed to address the dangers of the craze. NekNominate involves people filming themselves downing alcohol, nominating someone to continue the game, and posting the video on social media sites. Councils are now publishing warnings about alcohol through internet safety campaigns that provide links for parents, carers and young people. On Wednesday, the industry-funded charity Drinkaware called on parents to take a tough stance against the game over fears that young teenagers are under pressure to take part. Katie Hall, chair of the LGA’s community wellbeing board, said: 'This is an utterly reckless and totally irresponsible craze which has tragically claimed lives. More should be done to highlight the dangers and persuade people not to participate. 'We believe social media operators have a responsibility to provide health warnings to user groups and individuals. 'The LGA is looking for these corporations to show leadership -and not ignore what is happening on their sites. 'We are urging Facebook and Twitter executives to sit down with us and discuss a way forward which tackles this issue head-on.' The LGA said Boston Borough Council in Lincolnshire is encouraging those people nominated to continue the drinking game to contact their community safety team. Victims: Stephen Brookes (left) died after downing vodka on a night out while former grammar school pupil Isaac Richardson, 20, downed a lethal cocktail because he wanted to 'outdo' friends . Sevenoaks District Council in Kent is launching an internet safety campaign on NekNominate, while Worcestershire County Council has called for people not to join in. Norman Wells from the Family Education Trust said: 'It is tragic to see young people being deceived into thinking that consuming an excessive amount of alcohol in a short period of time is harmless fun. 'Parents and teachers desperately need to communicate the message that heavy drinking is not a game. 'Any sense of excitement that alcohol brings will only ever be short-lived, but the pain and distress caused by excessive drinking can last a lifetime. In fact, in some cases, it can even kill. 'Over recent years, growing numbers of British teenagers have chosen not to drink at all, but overall young people in the UK still drink higher levels of alcohol than many other European countries and are oblivious to the serious problems it can cause.' Ross Samson, 26, is thought to have inadvertently spread the game where players film themselves downing drinks and posting the videos online, daring others to outdo them . A Facebook spokesman said: 'We do not tolerate content which is directly harmful, for example bullying, but behaviour which some people may find offensive or controversial is not always necessarily against our rules. 'We encourage people to report things to us which they feel breaks our rules so we can review and take action on a case by case basis.' NAHT Policy Advisor Siôn Humphreys said: 'This craze and its tragic consequences need to be highlighted.However, a knee jerk reaction could prove counter productive. 'Highlighting the danger of 'nec nominations', which can include under-age drinking and substance abuse, would need to be delivered from an authoritative view point in an age appropriate manner to individual year group assemblies. Whole school assemblies are not a solution because of the wide age range involved. 'There may be circumstances in which a school becomes aware that pupils are involved in such activities and the first course of action would,as a matter of urgency be to discuss the matter with parents. Some situations could invoke a safeguarding response. 'Schools would also need to respond appropriately and proportionately if the consequences of involvement in ""nec nomination"" spill over into school.'

An argument between a wealthy couple living in the upscale community of Boca Raton, Florida, on Sunday evening ended with both spouses dead after the man killed his wife and was then shot by police after allegedly turning his gun on them. ‘Devoted family man’ Ian Burlakoff, 41, his wife Germana, 37, and their four children had been enjoying dinner at the Boca Raton country club on Sunday night when an argument between the couple escalated out of control. While on the outside the couple - prominent members of the local community - looked to have it all, they were in fact engulfed in crisis, in the midst of a divorce and due to lose possession of their near $2 million home. To the outside world Ian and Germana Burlakoff might have looked that a couple that had it all but they were engulfed in crisis - in the midst of a divorce and due to lose possession of their near $2 million home . Records show they owed between $1.4 million and $1.8 million on their home at the luxury The Oaks resort, which was set to be sold at auction next March if it wasn't paid off. Ian Burlakoff was a general manager at King Hyundai in Deerfield Beach, earning $800,000 a year and was described by stunned employees as a devoted father who also did a lot of volunteer work. Germana Burlakoff, who also went by the name Gemma, was a stay-at-home mother who cared for their three children – aged seven, five and one, plus his 12-year-old daughter from a previous marriage. The Burlakoffs had married in 2005, but just two months later he had been granted a temporary injunction against his wife, although the injunction was dismissed days later. After the couple began fighting on Sunday, Gemma Burlakoff tried to escape to her mother's condo in Boca Raton but husband Ian shot her in the street . The Burlakoffs owed between $1.4 million and $1.8 million on their home at the luxury 'The Oaks' resort in Boca Raton and the house was set to be sold at auction next March if it wasn't paid off . In June of this year Ian Burlakoff had filed for divorce, which was still pending. Gemma Burlakoff told a court in July that since filing for divorce, her husband had refused to support their children. She said he refused to pay the mortgage, and threatened to shut the home’s power off if she continued having her mother to the house. Gemma’s father Frank Villareale said his daughter had told him everything was fine between the couple when he had spoken to her two days before. He described his daughter as friendly and personable, but told the Sun Sentinel . that the couple had often fought over her husband's ‘gambling habit.’ Ian Burlakoff had accused his wife of 'outrageous shopping sprees' during which she would purchase hundreds of pairs of shoes . ranging from over $1,000 per pair. Records also show she liked pricey . purses too, spending upwards of $5,000 for a handbag. Relatives of Germana Burlakoff, 37, embrace after finding out that she was  murdered by her husband Ian on Sunday. An aunt described Germana's husband as a mean man who deserved to be shot . In return, she had accused her . husband of spending $1,000 a week on body waxing and steroids and . questioned why he had booked a two-bedroom suite at the Waldorf-Astoria . in Manhattan. 'He deserved to be shot,' an aunt of . Gemma Burlakoff told the Palm Beach Post. 'He was a mean man. My niece . did not deserve this. She was a beautiful girl.' Burlakoff’s ex-wife, who didn't wish to be named, described her ex-husband as an amazing father. She said she believed that her ex-husband was bipolar, which Gemma Burlakoff had also stated in court documents. 'It doesn't make any sense. They had four kids. He was a good guy and a family man,' Bonnie Shafter, an employee of Burlakoffs told WPTV.com. After the couple began fighting on Sunday, Gemma Burlakoff tried to escape to her mother's condo at Chalfonte, an oceanfront highrise on Ocean Boulevard. Ian Burlakoff was a general manager at King Hyundai in Deerfield Beach, earning $800,000 a year and was described by stunned employees as a devoted father who also did a lot of volunteer work . But her husband followed her there and shot her at about 6 p.m. across the street from the building. Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Teri Barbera said Boca Raton police officers who responded to the shooting encountered an armed Ian Burlakoff in the northbound shoulder of Ocean Boulevard. He ignored officers' commands and reached for his handgun, and a Boca Raton police officer fired shots at him, she said. The incident shocked residents of the upscale community, which rarely sees much crime. The children are currently staying with their grandmother.","A wealthy couple are both dead after an argument escalated out of control in Boca Raton, Florida, on Sunday .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:38 EST, 13 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:39 EST, 13 March 2014 . It has been revealed that the former police officer accused of killing a man in a movie theater during a dispute over texting had used his own phone to send a message to his son moments before the incident. According to documents released Thursday by Florida prosecutors, Curtis Reeves' son, Matthew Reeves, told detectives that his father texted him at 1.04pm on January  13- just moments before Curtis shot Chad Oulson dead. Curtis Reeves told his son he was already seated inside the theater. Matthew Reeves, who is a Tampa police officer, made plans to meet his parents at the theater for the 1.20pm showing of 'Lone Survivor' but was late because he stopped to wash his truck, he told detectives. Texting problem: Curtis Reeves, seen in court on February 7, shot another moviegoer dead 'because the man wouldn't stop texting' but new records show that Reeves had also sent his own text just moments before . Matthew Reeves said he had walked into the dark theater while the previews were playing and looked around for his parents. It was that moment, investigators said, that Reeves shot 43-year-old Oulson. 'Matthew . said he did not see the shot directly, but the noise and light drew his . attention to the top row of seats,' Pasco County Sheriff's detective . Aaron Smith wrote. Matthew Reeves tried to help Oulson by pressing a stranger's T-shirt against Oulson's bleeding chest wound. Curtis . Reeves, 71, was charged with second-degree murder. He also was charged . with aggravated battery; authorities say the bullet that struck and . killed Oulson also struck Oulson's wife, Nicole, in the finger as she . tried to shield her husband. Revealing: Court documents prove that Matthew Reeves, seen here with his mother on February 7, had received a text from his father just minutes before his dad shot another person in the theater . Reeves has pleaded not guilty to both counts. If convicted, he faces a mandatory minimum of 25 years in prison. Reeves . is being held without bail in the Pasco County Jail. His attorneys say . Reeves acted in self-defense. Reeves told police that Oulson hit him in . the face, possibly with a cellphone. Other witnesses, including Reeves' wife, say they never saw Oulson strike Reeves. Reeves' attorneys did not immediately return a call for comment regarding the . hundreds of pages of newly released discovery evidence documents. A . judge ruled Wednesday that the documents could be released publicly. In . early February, the evidence was sealed from the public for 30 days so . Reeves' attorneys could review it and perhaps challenge all or parts of . its release to the public. Victim: Chad Oulson (center, with his wife Nicole and their daughter) was shot and killed in the movie theater and his shooter's son Matthew, a police officer, came to help try to put pressure on the wound . Also injured: Mrs Oulson, seen in court on Wednesday, was also hit by the bullet and it struck her finger as she tried to shield her husband, so Reeves is being charged with aggravated battery in addition to second-degree murder . They had no challenges Wednesday, largely because much of the information was released during a two-day bond hearing. A chunk of the documents are from Reeves' personnel file from his decades as a Tampa police officer. Reeves . regularly received outstanding evaluations and numerous letters of . commendation for leadership skills and for training he led on gun safety . and other topics. He retired in 1993. The . file also contains an interview with Jamira Dixon, a 35-year-old woman . who said that in December, Reeves became upset with her because she was . texting in the same movie theater. During . the incident, she said, Reeves complained to a manager, then continued . to stare at her throughout the movie and made her feel uncomfortable. The . documents also offer witness interviews of the January 13 shooting. They reveal the chaos and confusion in the theater when Oulson was shot. Edward . McFadden, 76, told Pasco County Sheriff's detective Matthew Myers that . he was seated in the theater and heard a loud noise behind him. 'He . told me it sounded like a gunshot, but he wasn't sure if it was real or . from the previews because they had just shown a preview for Robocop, . which had a lot of gunshots in it,' McFadden said.","Court documents reveal that Curtis Reeves sent his son Matthew a text at 1.04pm telling him that he was already seated in the theater .
When Matthew, a police officer arrived late to the 1.20 showing, the trailers were playing and he tried to spot his father .
That is when Curtis Reeves, a retired police captain, shot and killed Chad Oulson because apparently Mr Oulson's texting disturbed Reeves .
Records released Thursday show that Reeves, 71, had previously made a complaint to the theater managers about a different texting incident .
Reeves is on trial for second degree murder and aggravated battery since the bullet that killed Mr Oulson also injured his wife, Nicole Oulson ."

One of the country’s most senior judges was facing calls to be suspended last night after his links with a notorious paedophile pressure group were revealed. Lord Justice Fulford, who was appointed an Appeal Court judge only last year, was founder of a campaign group that tried to defend and promote the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE). The campaign carried out a demonstration outside a courtroom in favour of PIE members on trial, including its leader Tom O’Carroll, who was later jailed for possessing pictures of naked children. Fulford also took part in meetings at which O’Carroll was present. During the campaign, Lord Justice Fulford, then a radical young barrister, said the paedophile organisation was no more than a means for ‘paedophiles to make friends and offer each other mutual support’. The judge is the latest figure to be embarrassed over links to PIE. Last month, Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman expressed regret over the help given to PIE by the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL), the organisation for which she worked as legal officer. Her MP husband Jack Dromey and former Labour Cabinet minister Patricia Hewitt were also part of the NCCL while it allowed PIE to operate as an affiliate. Yesterday, Lord Justice Fulford apologised for his connection to the paedophile group, but anti-child-abuse campaigners said he should be suspended while an inquiry into his past political activities was conducted. Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘There should now be a suspension. ‘This discovery is akin to finding out that someone who is now in a high-ranking and responsible position was an active supporter of the IRA at the time it was planting bombs and murdering people. We are talking about a very serious matter here. I think suspension is the right course.’ Labour MP Tom Watson said the disclosure ‘reinforces the argument that there should be a full investigation into the role of PIE’. Labour deputy leader, Harriet Harman, expressed regret over the help given to PIE by the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL), which her MP husband Jack Dromey was also part of . The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office could start an inquiry. If any fault were found, the judge’s future would be decided by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. Responding to the allegations against him in the Mail on Sunday, Lord Justice Fulford apologised, but said he had ‘no memory’ of founding the Conspiracy to Corrupt Public Morals campaign group, which operated in support of PIE, or details of its work. ‘I have always been deeply opposed to paedophilia and I never supported the views or objectives of the PIE. I attended a few meetings of the NCCL’s gay rights committee. I remember that for a short period Tom O’Carroll was sometimes present, which left me feeling extremely uncomfortable. ‘In the main, I provided some legal advice in the context of general civil liberties objections to the wide-ranging charge of conspiracy to corrupt public morals.’ He said he profoundly disagreed with those who sought to lower the age of consent. PIE campaigned for it to be set at the age of four. Sir Adrian Fulford, 61, became the first openly gay barrister to be promoted to the High Court bench in 2002. He was a housing adviser for Shelter and political activist in the 1970s before becoming a lawyer.","Lord Justice Fulford founded group that defended paedophile campaigners .

Surf photographer Clark Little will ride any wave for the perfect shot, with water crashing onto him from up to 15ft above his head. Pictured below are the stunning photographs taken by the 44-year-old from inside the waves. Mr Little, who lives on Hawaii's North Shore - renowned for its waves and great surf - has been taking photographs from the ocean since 2007. His tool is a Nikon D300 with a fish eye lens. The ultra-wide angle fish eye creates a wide panoramic picture. The camera is then cased into a waterproof box. Scroll down for video . Clarke Little waits for a mutant barrel that could fit a large school bus to fall. The wave breaks in water less than 2ft feet deep and the sand gets sucked off the sea floor and into the wave . Pictured: a shot from behind a breaking wave looking towards shore. Here, the photographer is under water and the curve of the wave distorts the beach scene elongating the palm trees . Wave photographer Clarke Little captured this picture during a morning photo session from inside the tube at Teahupoo, Tahiti's most famous surf break. Breaking on a very shallow reef, this spot is known as one of the deadliest waves in the world . Surf Photographer Mr Little, 44, pictured here inside a tube wave as it breaks on North Shore, Oahu, Hawaii. His tool is a Nikon D300 with a fish eye lens, cased in a waterproof box. The ultra-wide angle fish eye creates a wide panoramic picture . Mr Little looks out of a glassy California barrel during sunset on Newport Beach in California . Holding a waterproof camera with an attached strobe flash, the photographer throws himself down on the sand as the wave pitches over and creates an opening with a sunset view in the distance . So as not to lose his valuable tool when tossed around by a wave, the camera is tied to a leash attached to his ankle. The photographer presses the trigger and the camera then fires out an impressive nine to 10 frames per second. Not only does the 10lb camera come into the ocean with him, the photographer also drags in tools such as strobe lights so that he can capture the scene perfectly. And no wave fazes Mr Little, who has been hurtled into waves as high as 15ft before being thrown back down to the ground. As he swims, he passes marine wildlife on his way, wearing flippers to help him glide through the ocean. Although his career started out in his native Hawaii, Mr Little travels the world to land the perfect picture - capturing some of the world's biggest waves as he goes. Mr Little started out as a surfer in the 80s and spent two decades riding the waves before discovering his passion. As a surfer, his talent lay in riding shore break waves - waves which break close to the shore - and coming out in one piece. Then, in 2007, his wife, Sandy, asked him to take a photograph of a wave breaking for their house. The surfer stood up to the challenge, bought a cheap camera and threw himself into the wave. He has been photographing the water hurtling down to the shore ever since and has exhibited his pictures across the world from Japan to Brazil.

The surf photographer is pictured here lining up his perfect shot moments before the wave is about to crash onto him . He describes his vision as photographing the waves 'inside out'. The photographer spends his days in the water because: 'I love to be in the ocean and I love to take pictures of mother nature. 'I have a major passion for being in the ocean and capturing these images,' he said. In an interview with Fox 5, Mr Little said: 'I'm getting right into the perfect spot. 'I'm . just holding the trigger and the adrenaline's pumping because I want to . get the best shot. But at the same time you're going to get pummeled.

Instead, the true light from inside the wave is perfectly captured . A classic Californian setting captured from a new perspective: Malibu Pier shot by Mr Little from inside the tube . Mr Little is pictured here grabbing onto his camera before snapping the inside of the tube as it crashes onto him. The waterproof camera housing has a safety leash attached to his wrist so the camera is not lost if the unit is ripped from his hand . This is the breathtaking moment two waves collide and send a fan of water upwards in front of the setting sun to create a stunning image . 'So I kind of hold my breath and a lot of times I get sucked up, a lot times I get sucked up into the falls.' The . results of the photographer's time in the water are breathtaking, but . mainly Mr Little says he throws himself in, wave after wave, because he . has 'a great time'. Sometimes . he has to tuck his camera under his arm to stop it from being dragged . away by the ocean. 'Or, I get in the featal position and hope for the . best,' he said.

Barely 20 years after it brought digital viewing into the nation’s living rooms, it seems the DVD is on its way out. Machines that play and record the discs are being overtaken by ‘on demand’ streaming services such as Netflix – suggesting DVDs themselves will soon follow video tapes and vinyl records into the dustbin of history. The latest victim of technological advance has been signalled by the release of the annual ‘shopping basket’ by the Office for National Statistics – a list of 700 items that reflects household spending habits and is used by the Government to identify the official inflation rate. Known as the consumer price inflation index, the rate is calculated using 180,000 price quotations from 150 areas across the UK, and sets the benchmark for increases in pensions, benefits and often pay. DVD recorders have been dropped from the basket completely and rental subscriptions have also been replaced. Hardwood floors join the list of casualties as families turn away from minimalist design in favour of carpets, while the continued squeeze on the cost of living has also caused the removal of fees for gardeners and children’s after-school clubs. However, their replacements reveal the impact of celebrity culture on the public’s buying patterns. Fresh fruit snacking pots have been included to reflect the increasing shelf-space in supermarkets devoted to prepared fresh fruit. Honey is on the list for the first time, perhaps a result of renewed interest in baking . Service providers are also taking on traditional broadcasters by making their own exclusive content. Netflix, for example, has had a hit with its series House Of Cards, the US political drama starring Kevin Spacey . Canvas training shoes, like those . favoured by Prince Harry’s girlfriend Cressida Bonas, and statement . necklaces like the one worn by Charlize Theron to the Oscars have made . it into the basket for the first time, while the influence of smartly . dressed male stars such as Gary Barlow can be seen in the addition of . men’s rented suits. Hire firm Moss Bros has reported strong growth in recent years, pointing to rising popularity of school proms for suit hire and men smartening up for their weekend wardrobes. Hire firm Moss Bros has reported strong growth in recent years, pointing to rising popularity of school proms for suit hire and men smartening up for their weekend wardrobes .

Honey, which is perceived as a healthy alternative to sugar and jams, also makes an appearance. It has been helped by recommendations from chefs like Lorraine Pascale and a return to cooking from scratch as seen on The Great British Bake Off. However wallpaper paste has been omitted, as DIY and the chore of putting up wallpaper is rejected by many young families in favour of emulsion paint.","Demise of DVDs due to streaming services such as Netflix .

Tragic: Jamie Edward Capon, 16, died after binge drinking at a friend's birthday party in August last year . A 16-year-old died after a binge drinking session at a friend's birthday party caused him to suffer acute alcohol poisoning and pass out, an inquest has heard. Jamie Edward Capon was more than five times the legal drink-drive limit when he passed away in hospital on August 3, last year. The teenager had been celebrating with Hannah Harrison, at her home in Aberdaron, on the Llyn Peninsula in North Wales. Jamie, from Llanaelhaearn, Gwynedd arrived at the party at around 9pm. The inquest heard the 16-year-old passed out and was put to bed on his side, by the birthday girl's mother, who is medically trained. Daniel Jack Ransley, giving evidence at the inquest, said the party goers ranged from 15 to 17 years old and had brought their own alcohol. He said: 'I did see Jamie drink on the night, there was nothing unusual about the way he was acting but he was a bit drunk. 'He got taken to a bed in the conservatory by some other friends and then he passed out. 'I've seen him drink alcohol before so I just thought he'd had too much, it wasn't unusual.' Stephen Harrison, Hannah's father, told the inquest he had been present at the party but had not provided any alcohol. He said: 'We were in the lounge and the kids were in the marquee in the garden. 'I had come back from work around 6pm and they'd all had something to eat before heading back out to the marquee. 'I did not provide any alcohol at the . party. I didn’t recognise a lot of people who were there as a lot of . people were from Pwllheli, I didn’t recognise Jamie, but he didn’t . arrive until around 9pm. 'The . first time I noticed him was when one of his friends said he was . sleeping in the garden, my wife, who is medically trained, set up a bed . for him and laid him on his side. 'I . wanted to close things down by midnight, I checked Jamie once again . before I went to bed and my wife stayed up for around an hour and a . half. 'The next thing my . daughter came home and I heard a huge scream across the house, I ran . downstairs and saw my wife and daughter giving CPR to Jamie. 'We rang the emergency services and he was taken to hospital.' 'Brilliant': Paying tribute at the time Jamie's parents said he was a 'brilliant, kind-hearted son'. A coroner ruled he died as a result of abusing alcohol . Paying tribute days after his death, the parents of Jamie Capon described the teenager as a 'brilliant, kind-hearted son'. His mother Lesley Roberts told North Wales News, the family had donated the 16-year-old's organs to four different people, in the wake of his death. She said: 'He lit up a room. We are glad that Jamie was able to help somebody else.' While his father James added: 'Jamie was the apple of my eye. He was a very special person. 'I really do miss him. I don't know how we'll get on.' At the time the family believed Jamie had suffered a brain haemorrhage. Doctors told his parents the teenager had suffered a 'massive bleed'. He left his parents, three brothers and two sisters. After completing his GCSEs, Jamie had planned to go on to study an arts course at college in Bangor. Mr Harrison told the coroner that Jamie had a pulse before he was taken to Ysbyty Gwynedd Hospital. A . blood test carried out in the ambulance showed Jamie had 414 . milligrams of alcohol per 100 milligrams of blood compared to the legal . limit of 80 - which was more than five times the drink drive limit.

A boxer who starred on TV bailiff show Repo Man has been spared jail after he scrawled abusive graffiti on a cancer victim’s home - falsely branding him a paedophile. Yob Reece Jones - known as 'Rampage' in the ring - was paid by another man to plaster the £275,000 home of Kenneth and Jayne Mair with false allegations as part of an ongoing feud. The 26-year-old starred in the Channel 4 documentary ‘Repo Man’ - a fly-on-the-wall documentary about the shadowy world of debt collectors and bailiffs. Yob Reece Jones (pictured) plastered the home of Kenneth and Jayne Mair with false allegations to clear a debt with another man . Jones (left), who starred in the Channel 4 series Repo Man, was given a suspended sentence, which was branded 'disgusting' by cancer suffering victim Kenneth Mair (right) Mr Mair, who lives with his wife and daughters, Alex, 24, and Natasha, 21, said he was 'disgusted' with the sentence - which he branded 'too soft'. Two million viewers tuned into the controversial Channel 4 show, which saw Jones and his team repossess cars and other property from debtors. Stafford Crown Court heard Jones used bitumen to write ‘nonce’ and ‘sex pest’ on the walls of Mr and Mrs Mair’s home in Cannock, Staffs, on April 24 last year. Tattooed Jones pleaded guilty to criminal damage today and was given a 16-month sentence, suspended for two years. He was also ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work, and told to pay Mr Mair, who is battling liver and bowel cancer, £400 compensation. Judge Recorder Rachel Brand said the damage to Mr Mair's £275,000 family home in Cannock, Staffs, was 'appalling' Jones, 26, told the court he carried out the graffiti attack so another man would write off a £1,000 debt . Dad-of-one Jones, of Uttoxeter, Staffs, was also banned from approaching Mr and Mrs Mair’s home. Judge Recorder Rachel Brand told Reece he was a 'fool' for carrying out the attack on behalf of another man, who he refused to name in court. She said: 'Someone else used you. Now you are here on your own to pay the penalty. What a fool. 'What you did to this man’s home was appalling, creeping up in the dead of night, daubing insults which, come daylight, would have been seen by anyone passing by. 'You had no grievance with this man, in effect being paid to do it. You were told the debt of £1,000 you owed would be wiped out.' Tattooed Reece Jones, from Uttoxeter, Staffs, is known as 'rampage' in the boxing ring . Jones, second left, gained notoriety in Repo Man, a fly-on-the-wall documentary about debt collectors and bailiffs . The court heard Mr Mair, 59, a retired development manager, and his 56-year-old wife, a theatre manager, had been the victims of a four-year campaign of harassment. It accumulated in the graffiti attack on their property and Jones was caught after he left gloves containing his DNA at the scene. The court heard Jones refused to reveal the identity of the other man involved. Prosecutor Nick Burn said: 'During the police investigation, the defendant maintained no comment. He added: 'Of particular impact were the words used. 'It is quite plain that there is no substance whatsoever to the assertion that the victim is in any way responsible for any crime or misbehaviour.' Victim Mr Mair hit out at the suspended sentence Jones received, insisting it was 'too soft' Prosecutors told the court the words daubed on the house had no grounding and the victim bore no responsibility . Cancer sufferer Mr Mair said he had to get his neighbours to help him clean up the mess . Rashad Mohammed, defending, said Jones did voluntary work teaching youngsters to box. He said: 'This defendant has no grievance with him...someone else has asked him to do their dirty work for them.' Speaking after the case, Mr Mair said: 'I am not a well man and my neighbours helped me clean off the graffiti. 'The grafitti, which was in two-foot high letters said ‘nonce’ and ‘sex pest’. All these claims are false, of course. 'When I found out what Reece Jones’ sentence was I had finished a session of chemotherapy and I was knocked for six. 'He (Jones) got nothing. He has got away with attacking my home. 'I am disgusted the sentence was so soft - what kind of message does that send out to these bullies?'","Boxer who appeared in hit TV show pleaded guilty to criminal damage .

The recordings by Buisson include day-to-day discussions of a chief executive and his entourage. There's also chitchat between Sarkozy and Bruni, which was at the core of Monday's proceedings. Atlantico said the recordings were published and transcribed 'for legitimate public interest' - but it has taken down those involving Bruni because 'she is not a political personality and never claimed any role as such.' The politician's lawyers have requested 30,000 euros from Buisson plus a symbolic fine of just 1 euro against the online publication that posted the recordings, Atlantico .

Although police would only say that the . man had suffered serious injuries and wounds to his groin area, it is . understood that his penis had been cut off and was missing, prompting . officers to close sections of the route in order to search for it. Around eight officers were seen combing a grass verge at the side of the road, while tape was used to seal off a section of the carriageway. Officers search the verge of the dual carriageway for the man's organ and other forensic evidence . A member of staff at Asda close to where the incident happened said he heard the victim had suffered a horrendous injury to his groin . Road block: This stretch of the A66 was sealed off by police investigating the incident . The road closed some time between 4.20am . and 9am and was open again by midday.

A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault in relation to the incident was held in police custody this afternoon, where he was being questioned by officers and was bailed pending further enquiries. The injured man, of Southbank, Middlesbrough, was found at 4.50am with serious injuries and was taken to hospital by ambulance, officers said. Ambulance: Mr Hewitt was found at 4.50am with serious injuries and was taken to hospital . Investigation: Officers were said to be 'keeping an open mind' as to how the man was injured . 'The road closures were required as part of the investigation into how the man received his injuries,' said a police spokesman. 'This . is necessary so that officers can look for anything which may shed . light on how he became injured or his direction of travel.' The police had taped off a Vauxhall Zafira on a nearby gypsy site. He added: 'If the road was not closed any evidence could be lost or destroyed.' 'Investigations are at a very early stage.'

Professor Raj Persad, a consultant urologist and erectile dysfunction expert at Bristol’s Urological Institute, said: 'It can bleed a hell of a lot. It's just like severing a finger. 'You need to keep it clean and put it in an isolated plastic bag then pack (the bag) with ice. 'The functional recovery will depend on where the injury was. It's very difficult to re-suture the nerves but you can rejoin the corporal tissue (the erectile tissue which contains most of the blood in the penis during erection) and the urethra. 'The further away (the wound) is from the pudendal nerve (a nerve in the pelvis that carries sensation from the genitalia), the more likely he is to get function. Hopefully there are enough nerves left. 'He may end up with numbness along the shaft of the penis. 'He will be left with a deficit of some sort.' A man who had been walking his dog through the area when police started closing the roads said: 'From what I could gather there had been some sort of stabbing. 'I asked an officer what was going on and he said there was no risk to the public but someone had been seriously injured, they said it was just an individual incident though.' A man working in nearby ScS Sofas said: 'There has been a heavy police presence in the area all day, they have been walking around the area and generally chatting to public. 'Lots of people have said there had been a stabbing but that they had heard it from someone else so it was probably just rumours. 'Whatever it was it must have been pretty serious for them to have closed the roads for so long, it was a nightmare getting into work this morning. 'People have been coming in and asking if we knew what had happened but we had no idea either. 'I instantly thought it must have been a road accident seeing as they closed the roads.' A lady taking her shopping from Asda said: 'I know there has been a man hurt but there hasn't been much else said on the matter. 'There . is a lot of gossip about a stabbing but it could just be rumours with a . lot of people speculating over what it could be and coming to their own . conclusions.'

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 20:33 EST, 14 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:53 EST, 15 March 2014 . A former Tory Cabinet minister who advised George Osborne to introduce a dramatic increase in the threshold for the basic rate of tax has condemned him for ‘robbing Peter to pay Paul’ by dragging hundreds of thousands more families into the 40p rate. Critical: Lord Forsyth, who said hardworking people are being squeezed by the rate . Lord Forsyth, who headed a tax reform commission for the Chancellor before the election, said ‘ordinary, hardworking people’ who were far from well off were now paying the higher rate of tax. He insisted there should be no further increases in the £10,000 starting threshold for income tax if it meant more people being pulled into the 40p rate. The intervention of the former Scottish Secretary is particularly significant as it was his report in 2006 that recommended lifting the basic rate threshold to take 2.5million people out of tax altogether. Some 4.4million people now pay the 40p rate, up from just 3.02million when the Coalition came to power and only 1.35million in 1988. Mr Osborne is expected to increase the basic rate threshold to around £10,500 in next week’s Budget. Some senior Conservatives believe he will then call a halt to personal allowance increases to concentrate tax-cutting measures on National Insurance and the 40p threshold. But he is still expected to cut the £41,450 starting rate for 40p tax in real terms next week, increasing it by only 1 per cent – less than inflation. This will push more workers into the higher rate. Two former Conservative Chancellors – Lord Lawson and Lord Lamont – have suggested that too many ordinary middle class professionals are being made to pay 40p tax. Lord Lawson, who introduced the 40p rate in 1988, said yesterday that ‘far too many people’ were now in the band. About 4.4million people now pay the 40p rate, up from just 3.02million when the Coalition came to power and only 1.35million in 1988 (library image) And Lord Forsyth said a big hike in the threshold for the basic rate of tax was the 'first recommendation' of the Tax Reform Commission report he wrote for the Chancellor in 2006. But he added: ‘What I regret is that the Chancellor is funding it by robbing Peter to pay Paul, and making people who are earning more pay more. ‘He should acknowledge that he has been funding this by squeezing the middle classes.’ David Cameron has vowed to hand sweeping new tax-raising powers to Scotland if they vote ‘no’ in this year’s independence referendum. On a visit north of the border yesterday, the Prime Minister gave his first clear statement that he will back more devolution if the union is preserved on September 18. He did not reveal which specific powers would be given up by Westminster, but said the shake-up would allow Tories in Scotland to campaign for lower taxes. Currently, Scotland only raises about 15 per cent of its budget. However Mr Cameron told the Scottish Conservative conference in Edinburgh that the party was ‘committed to making devolution work better still’. He went on to say that: ‘A vote for no is not a vote for  “no change”.’ He added: ‘We have to reduce the burden of tax and not just shift it from one group to another. It doesn’t resolve the fundamental problem of the state taking too much, and has become the cuckoo in the nest which is destroying fledgling businesses and making people’s living standards fall.’ Lord Forsyth said a basic rate threshold of £10,000 was ‘absolutely’ high enough. ‘We have to recognise that we have exhausted the possibility for squeezing revenue out of the higher rate,’ he insisted. ‘It’s having a very damaging impact on ordinary hardworking people – the people that actually make Britain work. ‘If Osborne hasn’t got money to raise the basic rate threshold without dragging more people on relatively modest incomes into the upper rate of tax then he shouldn’t do it.’ Increasing pressure on the Chancellor, Ukip will fight the election on a policy of raising the 40 per cent income tax threshold to £45,000, although they have so far given no indication of how the move would be funded. But David Cameron told the Mail: ‘Anyone earning up to £100,000 has benefited, so it has been a tax cut for all those people and it’s important to bear that in mind.’","'Hardworking people' paying higher rate of tax - Lord Forsyth .

The Hackney-born hip hop artist, who is married to Quality Street heiress and Made in Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh, was charged last night under his real name, Stephen Manderson, after answering bail at a south London police station. He had called police to his London home in November, claiming he had been mugged for his Rolex watch. But when officers arrived in the early hours, they found that his £100,000 Mercedes had been involved in a crash with a van on the road outside. No one was injured in the incident but police arrested the musician at the scene. The 30-year-old was initially held on suspicion of drink-driving and spent a night in the cells. Days later the rapper - who had a No1 hit in 2011 with Read All About It, which featured vocalist Emeli Sandé - was re-arrested on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to the reported robbery. However, Scotland Yard said last night they were not pursuing this matter. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Stephen Manderson has been charged with drink-driving following an incident on November 3 2013. ‘He will appear at Bromley Magistrates Court on March 20.’ Green was reported to have been clubbing prior to reporting the robbery to police at 2.40am on November 3.

Earlier this year, Green said: ‘I know I couldn’t be with me - I’m an absolute nightmare. Claims: The rapper arriving to answer bail last night. A second accusation of attempting to pervert the cause of justice is no longer being pursued by the Metropolitan Police, a spokesman said . Timing: Two months after the incident the rapper married Millie Macktintosh, pictured left and right . ‘So, I think Millie is commendable just for being with me and she’s helped me no end. I’m a huge pessimist - and too much pessimism can lead to depression.’ Since leaving Made In Chelsea, Ms Mackintosh has become a health, beauty and lifestyle blogger and is a brand ambassador for Claire’s, the High Street accessory and make-up chain.

Both women have had children with 40-year-old Heath Campbell - Deborah is the mother of seven-year-old Adolf Hitler Campbell while Bethanie is the mother of Eva Braun who was born in November. Both women have had their children taken away from them by child services. Bethanie claimed that the incident was a misunderstanding after the two women raced down the stairs at home and Deborah's elbow hit her eye. Although the police did respond to the home they share with Heath Campbell who has nine children by five different women, Deborah had fled before they arrived. However, because she had injuries consistent with an assault they issued a warrant for Deborah's arrested according to the Hunterdon Country Democrat despite Bethanie refusing to press charges. Girlfriends: Bethanie Zito (left) and Deborah Campbell (right) have an unusual living arrangement with Heath Campbell at their home in Holland Township, New Jersey . History: In 2010 Heath and Deborah Campbell had their little boy named Adolf Hitler taken away and put into temporary care. The four-year-old boy and his two sisters - JoyceLynn Aryan Nation, 1, and 8-month-old Honszlynn Hinler Jeannie - pictured in December 2008 - were removed from their home by New Jersey's Division of Youth and Family Services . The paper also claimed that police had responded to a dispute on Sunday at the house and Bethanie told said that she did not know who called the police, but that it was not her. Heath Campbell, who first hit headlines after a bakery refused to ice his son's Nazi-inspired name on a birthday cake, said the argument on the stairs was over nothing. 'They argue about stuff all the time! They're like sisters,' Campbell said according to the Hunterdon Country Democrat. 'Society thinks the Germans and the Nazis are bad people when really we're not. We're family oriented.' The neo-Nazi said that this latest run-in with the law is another example of the conspiracy against him and his constitutional rights. 'This government here is so against the word 'Naziism.' It's pathetic,' he said. 'You can't breathe without them saying we're violent people and shouldn't have children.'

Campbell, who lives off government assistance, has swastika tattoos across his body, including prominently on his neck, and has frequented headlines since the birthday cake incident in 2008. He has fathered nine children with five different women but doesn't have custody of any of them. When he appeared in court earlier this year to fight for custody of his two-year-old son, Heinrich Hons, Campbell was photographed wearing a full Nazi uniform, with his devoted fiancee Bethanie at his side. He has conceded in the past that it is unorthodox for his ex-wife and fiancé to live together. 'It’s a family thing...They do yarning together. Crochet and all that,' he said. 'We're all fighting for children. We don't need this garbage anymore.' Heinrich Hons was the fourth child - all with Nazi-inspired names - that Campbell had with his last wife Deborah. He was removed from his parents just hours after being born in November 2011. The New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services said they took the boy because violence in the home. Namesakes: Deborah Campbell had a son called Adolf Hitler with Heath Campbell, while Bethanie Zito gave birth to his daughter named Eva Braun in November . They had already placed the couple's other three children – Adolf Hitler Campbell, JoyceLynn Aryan Nation Campbell and Honzlynn Jeannie Campbell – in foster care because of the alleged violence in the family's Holland Township, New Jersey home. Campbell's fiance, 22-year-old Bethanie Zito, gave birth to the little girl in a Pennsylvania hospital on November 11 and the couple named her after Hitler's long-term companion. After two days, the baby was taken into care by child services. 'I'm not allowed to have children because I’m a Nazi,' Campbell, from New Jersey, explained to the New York Daily News. 'That's what they're saying. Well, I'll stop making them when they stop taking them.' Zito explained that she was getting ready to leave hospital when nurses took away the little girl and workers from the Franklin County Children and Youth Service announced they were taking her. 'I started screaming,' she said. 'I got hysterical. I had just been checked out. I was breast-feeding my daughter for two days straight. I changed her. I had clothes on her.' The couple said they never abused their children and argued they were being targeted for the names they chose for their kids.

A mother-of-four who weighed 38st at her heaviest has learnt gastric bypass surgery is no quick fix to weight loss. Paula, 39, from Atlanta, Georgia, in the U.S., struggled to lose weight after initially having the operation as she continued to gorge on junk food and made excuses for not sticking to a diet. The telesales worker shares her story on TLC show My 600Ib Life as cameras follow her for a year on her weightloss journey. Scroll down for video . Burden: At 38st, Paula's children have to put her shoes on for her . In pain: The mother-of-four admits simply day-to-day activities hurt because of her size . Setting an example: Paula wants to change her ways so her children have a healthier future . Paula reveals that she gained weight by comfort eating at the age of six following a childhood trauma where she was molested by a family member. She then gained 50lb (more than 3st) carrying each of her children till she eventually tipped the scales at 38st. She said: 'I wish I had been taught that food is fuel, . that it's what you put in your body to make it go. I don't eat for . fuel but for enjoyment. I love food. I have a relationship with food. When it tastes good it takes me to a happy place. 'When I didn't have . friends or family there for me, food was. It doesn't hurt you . emotionally even though it does physically.' She admitted her love of food was ruining her life - and that of her three teenagers and her eight-year-old daughter. Goal: Paula is eventually approved for gastric bypass surgery . Fast food addicts: She hopes the operation will help her lose weight as she and her family don't eat well . 'When you're this big it effects . everything,' she said. 'It hurts to move it hurts to walk. I'm huge. I'm a monster. All the day-to-day tasks that people take for granted are difficult for me . to do. 'I can't take care of my family. The kids have to take care of the . house and I am heavily dependent on them. I am a burden to my children and I don't want them to be picked on because of what I look like.' Her eldest daughter Madison admits: 'I have to put her socks and . shoes on and rub lotion on her. It's like she's a disabled person. I feel like . I'm doing more than a teenager should be doing.' Paula said she hates being a burden to her children but her wake-up call to change her ways came after she lost her husband, Alan. He was morbidly obese and died at the age of 33. She said: 'His weight killed him. He was over 600lb and his kidney weren't functioning. His health got worse and worse. On some days he couldn't even get out of bed and wasn't living life at all. 'One day his heart stopped beating and they couldn't restart it. I don't think that I'm far . behind him. I won't be here soon if I don't make a change.' Drastic action: Paula lost her husband because he was obese and doesn't want to die young like him . No excuses: Dr Nowzaradan tells her that in order for the surgery to work, she needs to commit to exercising and healthy eating . Paula believes the answer is to have gastric bypass surgery and she's so determined to get it, she moves her family 800 miles to Houston, Texas, to be near Doctor Nowzaradan who she hopes will approve her for the operation. The doctor tells Paula that first she has to make lifestyle changes and she won't be allowed to have surgery until she has proved this by losing some weight. Paula is adamant that she can do it - but on her return visit a month later she has gained a more than a stone. She explained that it's too hard to eat foods Dr Nowzaradan recommended. She blamed her weight gain on fluid in her legs, her sedentary state working at a computer eight hours a day and only being able to eat fast food when travelling between Georgia and Houston to visit extended family. She said: 'I know I eat too many carbs and I . don't exercise. My family and I have been eating fast foods our whole lives. It's going to hard to change all these habits. Everytime there is an event or family . gathering we have lots of food. I associate food with good moments.' She added: 'It's difficult to eat properly on the . road, the best option is fast food and there aren't a lot of healthy options . at drive-thrus. I know I'm eating foods I . shouldn't be but finding foods the doctor is OK with is difficult.' Difficult: At first she struggles to stop eating junk food because she enjoys the taste and can't find healthy food at drive-thrus . Dr Nowzaradan tells Paula to stick to a liquid diet of soup and yoghurt for a month. 'You need to stop making excuses or . surgery will never work. You clearly have an eating disorder,' he told her. 'I cannot . approve your surgery until you have lost some weight.' The liquid diet works and on her next visit, Paula is 10Ib lighter and approved for surgery.
