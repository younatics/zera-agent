"When svelte stars like Miranda Kerr and Megan Fox reveal the secrets to their youthful glow and trim figures, we're all ears. When the A-listers came out in support of clean juices, the world converted to all things green quicker than you could say kale. But the latest celebrity endorsed health tipple may be a little harder to stomach. Scroll down for video . Well, if it works for them! Miranda Kerr, left, and Megan Fox, right, are big fans of apple cider vinegar and now, the tipple looks set to become the new big health drink after the first restaurant with a menu dedicated to the stuff has opened in London . The latest way to lose weight and maintain a youthful glow in Tinseltown is by sipping on a vinegar-infused drink every morning. Megan Fox has said that because of her 'really big sweet tooth,' she'll sometimes cleanse with a combination of apple cider vinegar and water, claiming it 'cleans out your system'. Superfood and clean living advocate Miranda Kerr drizzles it on her salad, while Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna are said to devour fermented tonics to keep their looks in check. If you're laughing into your Coca-Cola reading this, hold that thought because the first restaurant with a menu dedicated to fermented vinegar has opened up in London - and the founders are convinced it's going to catch on. Testing, testing: The Raw Duck in London's Hackney is the first UK eatery to have a menu dedicated to ferments and they create different ones every day, which they say are extremely cleansing . The Raw Duck in London's Hackney is the first UK eatery to have a menu dedicated to ferments - and apple cider vinegar with a little sugar and grated apple left to develop for three days is one of its most popular concoctions. 'These are deliciously cleansing and help aid digestion,' owner Rory McCoy told The Metro. 'When we talk about probiotic, we think of those mass-produced yoghurts but these are the real thing. People should know about them. I try to drink a vinegar or eat a ferment every day for my health.' Speaking about the hot new £5 tipple, Katy Mason, Nutritionist at The Nutri Centre, told MailOnline: 'During the fermentation process, sugars are broken down by bacteria and yeasts, into alcohol, if you ferment this further then you get vinegar. You can make vinegar from many things fruits: vegetables and grains and in the case of apple cider vinegar - apples! 'Vinegar has been used for centuries for many purposes, pickling, cleaning as a condiment and for health. If you look on the internet you will find claims that vinegar, especially apple cider vinegar will relieve just about any ailment you can think of.' Benefits: Apple cider vinegar is used to support digestion and the liver and spleen, to heal bruises, boils and insect bites, to support oral and heart health and relieve headaches . She continued: 'Nutritional therapists have known about this product for years and will often recommend it to clients to help stimulate the digestion, alkalise the body and help with weight loss. 'The best apple cider vinegar to take is the less processed cloudy version, which looks like it has bits in it, these bits are called mother (living enzymes and bacteria) which are where a lot of the health benefits come from.' A spokesperson for Neal's Yard Remedies added: 'There’s more to vinegar than salad dressings and marinades. Studies have shown that it also has multiple medicinal properties. 'The earliest known uses of vinegar dates back more than 10,000 years and it started being produced and sold commercially across the known world 5,000 years ago. 'In ancient Chinese medicine, vinegar (made from rice) is bitter, sour and warm and its function is to drain and treat stagnation. Thus it is used to support digestion and the liver and spleen, to heal bruises, boils and insect bites, to support oral and heart health and relive headaches.

"These are tough times for Brendan Rodgers right now, and he will need to keep the fans onside. So is this why he has openly picked a fight with the England manager? I don't think there is any empirical evidence to back this up but my guess, based on the views of football fans from the city of Liverpool that I have spoken with over the years, is that a sizeable number - perhaps even a majority of supporters there - don't care about the fortunes of the England team at all. The former Swansea striker Lee Trundle was born in Liverpool but told me if it ever happened, he would even turn down an England call-up so that he could wait to play for the Republic of Ireland. Brendan Rodhers is deflecting attention away from Liverpool's bad start by picking a fight with Roy Hodgson . Daniel Sturridge is still sidelined after getting injured on international duty . Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge is battling to overcome a thigh problem . Swansea City's Lee Trundle had no intention of ever playing for England should the call have come knocking . Plenty of Liverpool and Everton fans have rung into my show over the years to express their apathy towards the national team. Liverpool fans loved it when Jamie Carragher retired from England duty at a relatively young age, and then admitted in his book that he cared more about Liverpool: 'Defeats while wearing an England shirt never hurt me in the same way as losing with my club… the Liver Bird mauled the Three Lions in the fight for my loyalties.' Most of us put club before country, there is nothing extraordinary about that. But as Carragher wrote, the Kop sing: 'We're not English, we are Scouse.' There is a level of antipathy from a lot of Liverpudlians towards the England team that some might find shocking. I personally understand it. Steven Gerrard was overlooked for the England captaincy a few years ago, in favour of John Terry. Southern bias? Maybe. Liverpool fans didn't particularly enjoy Roy Hodgson's reign at Anfield so perhaps some of them are quite keen to see him fail elsewhere. The negativity towards England from Liverpool fans reached a new low when one of them rang into my show last summer to express his support for Luis Suarez's Uruguay ahead of the World Cup clash with England. It is totally the right of any football fan to choose not to be bothered about the England team. But Rodgers is a clever guy, he will know by now the anti-England feeling among some Liverpool fans, so it looks to me like he's played the club versus country card early, to endear himself to the fans through a tricky period of transition. Players get injured in training and in games in domestic and international football – that's the reality. Rodgers sending some sort of dossier of instructions into the England camp with Daniel Sturridge is laughable. If all club managers did that, no players would be able to train, play or even meet up with the England squad. Roy Hodgson has escalated his war of words with Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers . Brendan Rodgers is trying to get Daniel Sturridge up to speed after four weeks out . Daniel Sturridge hasn't played since England's friendly win against Norway last month . It could be that Rodgers is upset that he was denied the opportunity to get involved with the England set-up – he could have been Harry Redknapp's assistant, but Hodgson got the top job instead. I'd like to think that bitterness isn't why Rodgers has caused such difficulty for Hodgson. The fact is, if either or both of Rodgers' signings Mario Balotelli or Rickie Lambert had started the season on fire, the boss wouldn't be so upset about Sturridge's injury. The Liverpool manager did superbly last season and he took the credit he deserved. In more difficult times so far this season, Rodgers would earn far more respect if he took criticism on board, rather than tapping into the anti-England and anti-Hodgson sentiment on Merseyside, and loading some of the blame onto the England manager.","Daniel Sturridge withdrew from the England squad through injury .

"Seven games in, and into the international break, let’s assess who’s been the best player so far in the Premier League. Diego Costa? Not for me. My vote goes to Angel di Maria. Of course Costa has been brilliant. But he walked into a team that should have won the title last season – check out those dropped points late in the campaign against Norwich, Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa. He has arrived to find a calm environment, a club without turmoil, and not in a situation of seeing a great empire virtually ruined by one stinking, disastrous season. Angel di Maria has been the standout performer in the Premier League so far this season . Manchester United's £60million signed has contributed goals and assists so far for Louis van Gaal . Diego Costa is the Premier League's top goalscorer after seven games of the new season . Costa’s great start is put into shade by what Di Maria has done at Manchester United, where he walked into a huge challenge. If Di Maria keeps up his form for United and takes them back into the Champions League, surely that is a far bigger achievement than anything any player might do at Chelsea this season? Let’s put it into context: Manchester United were a shambles last season. After the glory of the Fergie era, some of those players were on the floor under David Moyes. When Rio Ferdinand, with his record of success and medals, says Moyes had him “doubting everything” you can appreciate how low things had sunk at Old Trafford. It was so bad Nemanja Vidic fixed up a move and announced it mid-season – when did a top player do that at United? With senior players disillusioned, United were heading in totally the wrong direction. They finished seventh and won nothing. Then three members of the back four left - Ferdinand, Vidic and Patrice Evra. Three senior players. On top of that the new manager couldn’t start work until the Netherlands were out of the World Cup. Throw in an injury crisis as the season got under way and you’ll understand the gravity of the situation at Manchester United. Of course they’ve spent money – they needed to given how awful last season was. But in the context of everything I’ve just described, Louis van Gaal deserves some credit. The most expensive signing has been Di Maria. Big money players need to make a big impact – United needed that instantly from the Argentina wide man. And they got it. Some mega-money Premier League players have struggled to have an impact - Robinho and Juan Mata are two examples. And then we get to the deals that make Di Maria look like a bargain at £60million. Andy Carroll, Mesut Ozil and Fernando Torres have commanded fees at Premier League clubs that are eye-wateringly embarrassing for all involved. Cesc Fabregas has hit the ground running since moving to Chelsea from Barcelona in the summer . Andy Carroll cost West Ham United £15million when the striker signed from Liverpool . Mesut Ozil is still trying to get over leaving Real Madrid this time last year for £42million . Carroll - £35m of injuries. Ozil - £42m to be a lazy lightweight who is struggling to deal with Real Madrid rejection. Torres – a staggering £50m to miss sitters. Di Maria has been brilliant. He’s been a joy to watch and effective as well. If all you do is give Player of the Year to the top scorer or one of the champions, then Costa or Fabregas will walk it. But Di Maria is leading the United reconstruction. He’s walked into a total mess at Old Trafford. But he has hit the ground running, and led United back into the top four with some first class performances. Spanish striker Fernando Torres - now playing for AC Milan - cost Chelsea £50million . When United players were reportedly furious with van Gaal for taking Di Maria off at Leicester, then it’s clear the impact this player is having. At £60m he’s expected to instantly provide consistent quality to fulfill the expectations at Manchester United. He doesn’t have the security of a good defence behind him either. Costa has walked into an already very good Chelsea side. Di Maria arrived to find a big mess needed clearing up. He’s got stuck in, got his hands dirty and started the clean-up operation. The fact that Di Maria is adding some polish with some sparkling performances is a bonus for United. VIDEO Di Maria one of the world's top four - Heinze .

"Andy Robertson had hit back at the idea that England will face a physical battle in Scotland on Tuesday. England and Scotland face each other for the first time in Glasgow since the Euro 2000 play-off in 1999.

"A police force has become the butt of jokes after appealing for witnesses to the theft of a packet of Scotch eggs worth £1.65. A woman was caught on CCTV walking into a branch of the Co-Op in Minehead, Somerset and picking up the budget snacks before eating them and leaving without paying. Avon and Somerset Police apparently spent a month investigating the crime before launching an online appeal in a bid to identify the woman. Stolen: Police have put out an appeal to find a woman who shoplifted a packet of Scotch eggs (file photo) In a post on Facebook, officers wrote: 'The theft has been reported to police and an investigation has begun. 'If you recognise the woman, contact Avon and Somerset Police on 101 and quote 9774/14.' However, the petty nature of the offence led dozens of web users to mock the force for its over-zealous policing. BBC presenter Jeremy Vine wrote: 'It's all kicking off in Minehead - after investigating for a MONTH, here's what the police have got.' D. Reid Macpherson joked: 'They will have difficulty cracking the case.' Paul Connew said: 'Am I too hard-boiled by thinking the cops' brains scrambled by trying to crack it? Farcical.' Target: The theft took place at the Co-Op supermarket in Minehead, Somerset . 'Puncroaker' added: 'Well done Somerset police, targeting the hard-boiled criminals.' And Chris Wright said: 'Got to nip it in the bud early, today it's Scotch eggs, tomorrow pork pies, pretty soon they'll have a full picnic.' Avon and Somerset Police has now deleted the appeal, after a witness came forward claiming to know who the thief was. A spokesman said: 'We take all crimes that are reported to us seriously. Using social media can be a valuable tool for us and take just minutes to do. 'Last month two women were arrested within hours of a robbery appeal being published and we've also been able to return stolen property to their owners. 'On this occasion someone rang with a name within two hours and we are currently looking into this information.'

"A couple who were taking their two-year-old daughter on a walk in the country were shocked to come across two men enjoying a spanking session in broad daylight. Parents Allan Pagan and Natalie Fairhurst stumbled upon the scene while they were taking their little girl out on her pony near Waterbeck in Dumfriesshire. They said their daughter was 'thankfully oblivious' when they spotted a man in a blonde wig and a cream dress tied to a farm gate who was being whipped by another man dressed in a spiked-studded collar, chains and a leather harness. Allan Pagan was shocked to see a man in a blonde wig being whipped by another dressed in a full bondage outfit while on a country walk  with his two-year-old daughter near Waterbeck in Dumfriesshire . Mr Pagan, 39, told the Daily Record: 'We thought it was a woman until the person turned round and you could see his big Adam's apple. 'I've heard about things like this before but I never thought I'd see it with my own eyes by the side of a B road 50 yards away from my house.' Ms Fairhurst, 35, reported the incident on Saturday to police after noting the registration number of the car in which the two men, thought to be in their late 50s, fled. She said: 'It was broad daylight and my kids and other walkers and horse riders go along there regularly. 'It seemed like they wanted to be caught but I don't think they expected it to be us, because to say we were raging is an understatement.' A Police Scotland spokesman confirmed they were investigation a report of two men acting in an 'inappropriate manner'. He said: 'We are investigating a report of two males acting in an inappropriate manner near to a road end at a farm near Waterbeck at around 5.30pm on Saturday October 18. 'The first man, in his late 50s or early 60s, is about 5’8” tall, medium build, short thinning grey hair, and was wearing a white shirt, a spiked studded collar with chains and a leather harness. 'The second man is in his late 50s, 5’8” tall, wearing a blond wig and a cream dress. 'Both men left the scene in a grey coloured car when disturbed.'

"Charles Bronson claims he is now a peace-loving artist and has changed his last name to Salvador, after the famous surrealist artist . He is one of Britain's most notorious and violent prisoners, spending the last 40 years locked in solitary confinement. During that time Charles Bronson has still managed to attack 20 prison officers, take 11 hostages, and during one standoff demanded a helicopter, a blow up doll and a cup of tea. But it seems the 61-year-old has now reinvented himself as an artist named Salvador, and says he wants live out his remaining days in prison peacefully while focusing on his painting. Born as Michael Gordon Peterson, Bronson changed his name in 1987 after a bare-knuckle boxing promoter advised that it would be good for his career. But in a recent note, penned from the inside of Full Sutton prison in York, Bronson announced he is changing his name to Charles Salvador, after the famous surrealist painter. In the rambling letter, riddled with grammatical and spelling errors, he declares: 'Bronson come alive in 1987, he died in 2014.' He adds: 'It's now Salvador all the way to Disneyland, your welcome to join the ride but its non-violent all the way.' He also revealed his new motto, amor vincit omnia - Latin for 'love conquers all' - before declaring 'you work it out for yourselfs, like I had too.' The letter finishes: 'Years from now you'll all forget about Bronson, I've already forgotten. I'd sooner pull my teeth out than go through that hell again. 'Welcome to my new dimension, is there any ladies want their a**** painting? Cost you though, I don't come cheap! Oh well, time to fly, I can feel an art coming on.' Now he says his greatest wish is to be released from prison before his mother Eria, 84, dies. In a rambling letter, the life-term prisoner says Bronson 'died in 2014' and announces 'it's Salvador all the way to Disneyland...but its's non-violent all the way' Bronson declares his motto is amor vincit omnia - Latin for 'love conquers all' - before asking 'is there any ladies want their a**** painted?' Speaking to The Sun, via his campaign secretary Lorraine Etherington, he said: 'It would mean so much to her to be with me again as a free man. 'I am a changed man. I have started my journey as a brand new character, a very happy soul, a born-again artist. 'All I want is the chance to express myself as the artist and man of peace I now am.' Bronson was initially jailed in for seven years in 1974, then aged 22, for armed robbery, but quickly had his sentence increased by nine months after he attacked another prisoner with a glass jug. A rooftop protest at Walton Gaol in 1985 earned him another year inside, during which time he also tried to strangle the governor of Wormwood Scrubs. Bronson took up art in the mid-1990s while locked away  in the infamous 'Hannibal cell' at Wakefield prison . His art, much of which is posted online, includes self-portraits and surreal drawings about life in prison . He was released in 1987 and spent a total of 68 days outside prison, before being arrested for robbery. He was released again in 1992, but this time only managed 53 days outside before again being arrested for robbery and possession of a firearm. Over the course of the next five years, he took a prison librarian hostage, before repeating the stunt with three inmates at Belmarsh prison - forcing them to call him 'General' and threatening to eat one unless his demands were met. He was handed an indefinite life sentence in 1999 for kidnapping prison teacher Phil Danielson at Hull jail, and most recently attacked Alan Parkins, governor of Woodhill Prison, in February this year. While Bronson is commonly known as Britain's most dangerous prisoner, campaigner for his release have long tried to argue that he only poses a danger to the prison system. Miss Etherington, secretary of the Charlie Bronson Appeal Fund, handed a 10,000-signature petition to Downing Street last year asking for his release, saying he is 'no threat to the public.' Bronson was initially jailed in 1974 for armed robbery, but is now serving an indefinite life sentence after repeatedly attacking prison guards, taking inmates hostage and staging protests . He says he is a changed man and hopes to be released before his mother Eira, 84, passes away .","Charles Bronson jailed in 1974 for armed robbery but is now serving life term .

"This is the medical student who called herself Elizabeth Raine and controversially auctioned off her virginity - only to change her mind at the last minute, Mail Online can reveal. Hanna Kern, a high-achieving college graduate, made headlines around the world when she dubbed herself the 'Virgin Whore' and said she would sleep with the highest bidder. The intelligent, middle-class bioengineering student backed out of the sleazy auction on Wednesday, with the fee standing at $801,000. Revealed: Virgin Whore Elizabeth Raine is actually high-achieving graduate Hanna Kern . 'With the blessings of my management and the high bidders, I have decided to put a stop to this kerfuffle (to describe it nicely) and return my focus to my medical training,' she wrote on her blog, provocatively entitled Musings of a Virgin Whore. 'I still do possess some spitefully strong beliefs about virginity, prostitution, and a woman's right to do as she damned pleases, but school is my first priority (as it has been for my entire life). 'At this point, I no longer care about the auction, at all. This was a very easy decision.' But despite her claims to have abandoned the auction to concentrate on her schooling, Mail Online can reveal that Hanna hardly received any genuine offers for her virginity. In fact the, 'winning' bidder refused to go through any kind of vetting process and completely disappeared after he pledged to come up with the cash. A source . close to Hanna said: 'This auction didn't work, plain and simple. Hanna . had to face the fact that maybe her virginity wasn't worth as much as . she thought it was.' Mail . Online can also reveal furious professors at her college, the . University of Washington, found out about the auction and hauled her in . to explain herself. They have agreed to allow her to take crucial qualifying exams next Friday, but she will have to go in for talks next month. Auction: Kern offered up her virginity on a website, where she used the name Elizabeth Raine . At that point they will let her know what disciplinary action she will face for sullying the name of the prestigious university. They have already told her that her ‘immoral’ behavior has put her future career in the medical profession in serious jeopardy. Since abandoning the auction, Utah-born Hanna, has been keeping a low profile in her shared apartment in the north of Seattle. On Friday fellow students on campus said they recognized Hanna as the girl in the racy pictures posted on her blog site, but were in disbelief that that the 'shy' pupil would take part in such a scandalous enterprise. One male undergraduate said: 'I am absolutely amazed. I saw the story online and straight away I said it looks like Hanna, but I couldn't believe it was actually her. 'She's a really quiet, shy girl and this seems so out of character.' And after examining Hanna’s personality it seems she had been living a double live. Her fellow students knew her as a shy, studious pupil and the rest of the world knew her alter-ego, the opinionated and provocative Virgin Whore, Elizabeth Raine. In a string of forthright blog boasts, Raine initially explained how she was selling her virginity for the money. But in recent days, her tone changed and became far more political. 'It is no longer about the money,' she wrote. 'Instead, very broadly, it is about how society continues to exercise control over female sexuality by chaining it tightly to female morality. Cold feet: Kern pulled out of her online auction on Wednesday, saying she wanted to focus on her studies . 'It is about the fact that we have not left patriarchy in the past (we all know male morality is not judged by the same standard), and that a woman still cannot chose to do with her body what she pleases without eliciting condemnation and hate from those (or some of those) around her.' It seems she didn’t express those kinds of feminist views when she was studying for her undergraduate degree at the University of Boulder in Colorado. Hanna excelled during her time there and wrote a number of incredibly complex medical papers. She graduated in 2010 and started at the University of Washington, where she has specialized in bioengineering. Again, she has impressed in medical research and contributed to a number of ground-breaking papers alongside other students and professors. Hanna’s family life also seems at odds with her racy alter-ego. Her father Allan Kern is a successful business man, who lives in Long Beach, California and works as the Principal Consultant for the oil and gas firm he founded, APCperformance.com. His LinkedIn profile says he has 35 years experience and that he has authored numerous papers. He is a graduate of the University of Wyoming. His work in the oil industry took the family to Saudi Arabia about 20 years ago. He lived in the Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran with Hanna, her mother Kim, and her younger brother Jackson, who now lives in Athens, Georgia. Hanna suffered a personal tragedy at the age of ten, when her mother died in a plane crash near Delhi, India, in 1996. At the time it was the third-worst disaster in aviation history, claiming the lives of 349 people. Hanna - whose story made international headlines after representation by Australian firm Uniquemedia PR -  claimed on her blog that her family were fully behind her decision to sell her virginity. Auction: Despite attracting a bid of $801,000, a source claims those making the offers went quiet when asked to prove their credentials . But on Friday her father refused to speak to Mail Online over the phone, hanging up as soon as his daughter's name was mentioned. Hanna did respond to email, declining an interviewing, saying she was, 'very busy and stressed right now, with pressing school commitments'. When she set up the auction website, she initially hid her face, simply showing off her body in a series of provocative shots, professionally taken in a Seattle hotel. But after prospective bidders started to pull out because they could not see what she looked like, she changed her approach and posted a series of snaps giving away her identity. Bizarrely, she insisted she still wanted to remain anonymous, even though her heavily airbrushed image was there for all to see. And despite claims that bids for her virginity came flooding in, a source close to Hanna has revealed the majority were from chancers who refused to prove they had any way of coming up with the cash. The source said: 'Hanna has tried to pass this off as a success and said she took the decision to pull out despite that. 'But this auction did not really work. Sure, loads of bids came in, but when the men in question were asked to prove their credentials they went quiet. 'They could have been sitting In a trailer park without two cents to rub together, pledging to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars. 'The winning bidder laid down the offer, but when he was sent an email asking to send his number so he could be vetted, he went completely quiet. There is no way it was a genuine bid. 'Who knows why Hanna decided to pull out, but it might well have been because her virginity wasn't worth as much as she thought it was.' Hanna launched the online auction on March 31, but it seems she established the domain name of her website last June, meaning the auction was planned for almost a year. Initially, she said she wanted to sell her virginity because she was attracted by the adventure, eroticism, scandal and the chance to challenge the norm. In an interview with the Huffington Post, while her identity was still a closely guarded secret, Hanna said she was still a virgin because sex and relationships came second to school work and other commitments. 'I have a busy life. I am picky and guys were never a priority,' she said. She also admitted she was concerned her 'business venture' might get her thrown out of college if officials learned she's the 'Med School Virgin.' 'Lawyers have different opinions on whether I'd get kicked out, but one lawyer I trust believes it won't happen,' she said. If she had gone through with the deal, the sex would have taken place in Australia because prostitution is illegal in the U.S.","27-year-old is named as high-achieving bioengineering student Hanna Kern .

"Tougher: Rachel Reeves has said a Labour government would crack down on unemployment by introducing a guaranteed jobs scheme . Labour will be tougher than the Tories on the long-term unemployed in a bid to slash Britain's giant welfare bill, the new shadow work and pensions secretary has said. Rachel Reeves, who replaced Liam Byrne last week following Ed Miliband's frontbench reshuffle, said under a Labour government those who have been out of work for long periods of time would have to take a guaranteed job offer or face losing their benefits. The guaranteed job scheme proposed by Labour would offer under-25s work if they have been unemployed for one year. Over-25s would have to take a job after two years of unemployment. The scheme would be paid for by reintroducing a tax on bankers' bonuses. The former Bank of England economist claims the scheme would take 230,000 people off benefits. In her new role, the 34-year-old also said she has three main priorities - to show people Labour is on the side of the 'ordinary people'; to force work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith to admit his introduction of a new benefit system was a failure and to promote a new Labour vision of 'responsibility, decency and fairness'. According to Miss Reeves, the government is spending £9billion more now on social security yet more people are unemployed, on housing benefit and 4.8million are being paid less than the living wage.

"What does a celebrity stylist do when she can't find any shoes she likes? Create her own range of course. Willowy fashion editor Nicole Smallwood, 35, has spent years searching for stylish shoes to fit her size nine feet. Despite working on the industry's top glossies and having access to some of the flashiest fashion cupboards around, the 5ft 10in brunette has always had difficulty finding on-trend heels. So the London-based fashion expert decided to design her own. Celebrity stylist Nicole Smallwood has created a range of cool shoes for bigger feet . Nicole said: 'Being a stylist you’d think I’d have the pick of the bunch when it comes to finding fabulous shoes for myself. Wrong! It has always been a real chore to find shoes I can actually squeeze my feet into. And the ones I can fit into aren't generally stylish enough to be worn around my friends. 'The High Street really doesn't cater well for women with larger feet - and there are lots of us around. Heels, especially, are really difficult to find - most shops seem to assume that if we are tall we must want to live in flats. 'But I LOVE wearing heels. And I have been on the quest for the perfect pair ever since I started working in fashion over ten years ago.' Birmingham-born Nicole, whose clients have . included Elle MacPherson, Liv Tyler, Jessica Ennis and Abbey Clancy has teamed up with online shoe brand Upper Street to launch her . debut collection. She has collaborated with online shoe brand Upper Street . 'I wanted to create a range of classics with a twist that are flattering, wearable and still very stylish. The perfect court, the wear-anywhere strappy sandal and that killer shoe-boot that we all need in our wardrobes,' she said. The 11-piece collection - all named after Nicole's most stylish friends - features a mixture of metallic suedes in pink, amethyst and pewter and textured black fabrics including velvet, pony skin and shiny patent. Classic peep and pointed toe courts are given a twist with a sexy D’orsay cut or ankle strap and sandals feature delicate toe and T-bar straps in mirrored silver and lacquered black patent. Available in various heel and width heights the shoes are sold alongside Upper Street's design-your-own bespoke collection. Nicole says: 'The aim of my first collection is to help remove the stigma from having larger feet and produce a line that shows it is possible to have fashionable shoes in larger sizes.' Julia Grinham, Co-Founder of Upper Street said: 'We are extremely excited to be working with Nicole on this collaboration. Our customers have been asking us for a long time to launch a range of shoes for women with larger feet. 'They are fed up of feeling excluded from the market and want to be able to buy stylish and glamorous ready to wear shoes too.' Nicole has worked in the fashion industry for over ten years and hopes her debut shoe collection including the £235 Boyce (r) will give women with bigger feet the confidence to wear hot heels . The £220 Frenchie design features a double ankle strap . 1. Its all about texture this season make sure you have at least one pair of velvet shoes in your wardrobe. 2. Anyone can wear an ankle strap. Make sure you experiment and find out the thickness that suits you best, proportion is everything. 3. Accessorise your feet subtly for evening with understated sparkle that shimmers and doesn't shout. 4. More women are wanting shoes that look sexy yet they still able to walk in. Look out for heels that are just out of the clouds. 5. The shoe-boot is still a key shape weather it be autumn of winter choose one that takes you from day to night.","5ft 10in fashion editor fed up of not being able to find stylish heels .

"Jason Boog was immersed in publishing for five years as editor of the MediaBistro blog GalleyCat. When he became a dad, he was curious how best to foster a love of books in his newborn daughter. His solution was - what else? - writing a book about raising bookworms, Born Reading, out in July from Touchstone. Mr Boog, 37, lives in Los Angeles with his wife and now nearly four-year-old daughter, Olive. He works for a film production company, connecting screenwriters with experts to assist story development. Mr Boog's book coincides with a policy . issued Tuesday from the American Academy of Pediatrics asking doctors . to stress that parents should read to kids every day, beginning in . infancy. Bringing up bookworms: In a new book called Born Reading, former GalleyCat editor Jason Boog talks about raising children in the digital age, and why parents should read to their kids every day . In a new interview, the Associated Press posed four questions to Jason Boog: . AP: Isn't there enough guidance out there on fostering a love of reading in babies and young children? Mr Boog: When I was just starting to introduce my daughter to books, the iPad, lots of digital devices, were swamping the market. They entered the marketplace so quickly that I don't think we as parents, or even the child development experts - no one really - had enough time to process the whole change. There was this rapid shift in the way we read, so I set out in the book to speak to scientists, child development experts on how best to handle the new landscape. AP: Are parents too exhausted in their child's first year to read to them? Mr Boog: I started to read to my daughter from the very first few days of her life. On the one hand it's boring to have these newborns. They don't do very much. They kind of just sit there and you kind of need something to do to entertain them and entertain yourself. Then when I started speaking to the experts about it, that act of reading, even if your child is not speaking and not pointing to things in a book, but the act and the sound of your voice is turning on switches in their brain constantly in those first two years of life. I didn't realize that. So I would set her up in her bouncy chair and as she drank her bottle I would pull out a board book and read it to her. Every single day you would see a little bit more light in those eyes and you would see her start to follow the story a little bit. AP: How do you feel about the recommendation of no screen time for children under two? Mr Boog: . Some parents ban it completely during those first two years. We . definitely let Olive grab the iPhone or the iPad when we were on . airplanes or in long lines. We kind of used it as the pacifier of last . resort. More to come: Born Reading: Bringing Up Bookworms in a Digital Age by Jason Boog will hit shelves in July . I still struggle on a daily basis with my daughter to balance my need for making her lunch, for doing my work or getting dressed. She would play with the iPad all day if I let her, until she fell over and fell asleep. She has nothing in her brain that tells her to turn it off. It's a constant struggle for 21st- century parents to figure out what the perfect balance is for their child and devices. Realistically, you can't have zero screen time the way the world works now, with parents using devices every day and children seeing them every day. They're going to be curious. They're going to want to touch them. AP: Do you think parents, pediatricians, day care providers and others do enough to read to or expose babies and young children to reading? Mr Boog: Over the last 30 years we've developed this very rich body of research about the science of interactive reading. That is reading to your child in a way where you're asking questions, where you're having them compare it to their own experiences, where it's a very active, participatory experience. You can use a device, you can do it while watching Sesame Street, with a song, but it's you and your child and not your child and a device. So we've had 30 years of research telling us it's just crucial for a developing brain to do this. I feel like at a time when books, maybe, are receding a little bit from the public imagination, it's almost a public health issue to know this. People should be handing something out at the hospital saying it's really important that you do this with your child, have this interactive experience. It doesn't have to be an either-or proposition - book over device. It would be a terrible tragedy if the art of reading to your child is lost in the digital transition.","Jason Boog's book coincides with a policy issued Tuesday from the American Academy of Pediatrics asking doctors to stress that parents should read to kids every day, beginning in infancy ."
"It is not often that Oxford University finds itself receiving a rejection letter from a would-be student, rather than issuing them with one. So it will have raised a few scholarly eyebrows when state-educated Elly Nowell, 19, wrote to the elite institution’s Magdalen College without even waiting to hear whether her application to read law had been successful. In a parody of Oxford’s own rejection letters, she told admissions tutors: ‘I realise you may be disappointed by this decision, but you were in competition with many fantastic universities and following your interview I am afraid you do not quite meet the standard of the universities I will be considering.’ Mocking: A-level student Elly Nowell, who is predicted A*s in history, law and English literature, sent a scathing rejection letter to Magdalen College, Oxford . Miss Nowell, who says she changed her . mind about Oxford after being put off by her experience at interview, . claimed  its admissions process was biased against state-school pupils – . despite them making up more than half the university’s intake. She wrote: ‘Whilst you may believe . your decision to hold interviews in grand formal settings is inspiring, . it allows public school applicants to flourish in the environment they . are accustomed to and intimidates state school applicants, distorting . the true academic potential of both.’ The teenager also claimed there were . ‘significant flaws’ in Oxford’s education system and argued that the . ‘gap between elitism and discrimination’ was a  ‘narrow one’ that the . college had not ‘adequately addressed’. Rejected: Elly Nowell told Magdalen College, which counts Foreign Secretary William Hague among its alumni, that there were 'significant flaws' in its education system . She wrote: ‘Whilst you may believe . your traditions and rituals are impressive, they reflect badly on your . university…frankly, I feel humiliated for both you and your students.’ Describing the interview process as ‘torture’, she accused the college of being ‘rude’ for not offering her a glass of water. She also claimed there was an ‘obvious gap’ between minorities and white middle-class students that she found ‘embarrassing’. Letter in full: The rejection letter that Elly Nowell, 19, sent to Oxford University via email . Miss Nowell, of Winchester, . Hampshire, even cheekily warned the university to hold off on any . attempts to ‘reapply’ and wished it ‘every success in future’. Oxford yesterday hit back at her claims, pointing to figures that show . that for 2010 entry, 55.4 per cent of places for UK students went to . state school pupils. Full figures for UK 2011 entry are not yet . available but 58.5 per cent of offers were to state school pupils. A spokesman said: ‘The irony is that six out of the seven people offered . law places at Magdalen were state-educated. 'It’s really important to . understand that school attainment is the biggest factor affecting . Oxford’s mix of students – not the way Oxford selects them.’ Magdalen College, which counts among its alumni Foreign Secretary . William Hague, Private Eye editor Ian Hislop, documentary-maker Louis . Theroux and Oscar Wilde, interviewed Miss Nowell, a student at . Brockenhurst College, Hampshire, in December. She is predicted to get . A*s in her history, law and English literature A-levels, and now hopes . to read law at University College London. She said: ‘It was during my interview that I finally realised subjecting . myself to the judgment of an institution I fundamentally disagreed with . was bizarre. ‘I spent my entire time at the university laughing at how seriously they . were taking everything and felt like the only atheist in a gigantic . monastery.’ Oxford students took to Twitter to vent their anger at Miss Nowell . yesterday. One, going under the name ‘jpspencer2’, said: ‘Elly Nowell . has no idea what it is like to go to Oxford.

"Northern Ireland's perfect start to Euro 2016 qualifying came crashing down in Romania after Paul Papp ended their brave resistance with a second-half brace. Despite taking maximum points from their first three matches, including away wins in Hungary and Greece, Michael O'Neill's men were under siege for the entirety of the encounter. Yet their backs-to-the-wall defence looked as though it would yield a vital draw until right-back Papp struck in the 74th and 79th minutes to seal a 2-0 win for the new Group F leaders. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Paul Papp scored two late goals as Romania beat Northern Ireland in their Group F qualifier in Bucharest . Romania: Tatarusanu, Papp, Chiriches, Grigore, Rat, Pintilii, Sanmartean, Torje (Hoban 81), Chipciu, Tanase (Maximov 58), Stancu (Keseru 46). Subs Not Used: Pantilimon, Luchin, Puscas, Bicfalvi, Moti, Gardos, Prepelita, Lung Jr, Sepsi. Booked: Pintilii, Maximov. Goals: Papp 74, 79. Northern Ireland: Carroll, Conor McLaughlin, Conor McLaughlin, McGivern, McAuley, Baird, Hughes, Brunt, Evans (McKay 78), Norwood, McGinn (Clingan 63), Lafferty. Subs Not Used: Mannus, McCullough, Lund, McCourt, McNair, Grigg, Magennis, Reeves, McGovern. Booked: Conor McLaughlin, Lafferty. Att: 40,000 . Ref: Jonas Eriksson (Sweden). The result was well deserved for the hosts, who also hit the crossbar, missed a sitter from point-blank range and had a convincing penalty appeal turned down, but Northern Ireland will still feel disappointed. They put in a monstrous defensive effort at the Arena Nationala, led by captain for the night Gareth McAuley and assisted by tireless shifts from Aaron Hughes, Chris Brunt and Oliver Norwood. Kyle Lafferty, having scored in his previous three matches, also ran himself to a standstill in an isolated forward role. The first half was a story of relentless, yet ultimately fruitless, one-way traffic. From kick-off Romania punted the ball towards left-back Ryan McGivern, the first in a series of attacks aimed down the flanks. McGivern and right-back Conor McLaughlin both ply their trade in League One, with Port Vale and Fleetwood respectively, and there was a concerted attempt to expose them. There were few breaks for the back line either, with Lafferty alone up front and unable to hold up possession for any length of time. It still took 15 minutes for Romania to test Roy Carroll, out-of-favour Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches producing a nimble bicycle kick that the Notts County stopper gathered at the second attempt. The visitors' first chance followed almost immediately, Lafferty burrowing into the box before Brunt slid a low shot just wide of the far post. Romania went again and should have scored when Alexandru Chipciu spurned a glorious double chance in the 17th minute. He looked certain to convert a perfect cross from six yards but his crisp volley rebounded off the underside of the crossbar. Papp's double saw Romania hit top spot in Group F as they knocked Northern Ireland into second place . Papp opens the scoring in the 74th minute as Northern Ireland goalkeeper Roy Carroll watches the ball hit the back of the net . Papp's first goal in the 74th minute finally broke down Northern Ireland's resistance in Bucharest . The ball then bounced over a disorientated Carroll and fell invitingly for a second attempt, but this time Chipciu headed gently back to the grateful keeper. Hughes and McAuley were fighting fires in the centre, clearing, intercepting and heading away a raft of crosses and through balls, while Niall McGinn was struggling to cover McLaughlin on the right. Lucian Sanmartean has been fancifully likened to the great Gheorghe Hagi but a wonderful run in the 32nd minute only improved the 34-year-old's credentials. Collecting the ball just inside the opposition half he charged past Corry Evans and made his way to the edge of the area where he weaved his way past McAuley and McLaughlin before cutting the ball across goal for Bogdan Stancu to slot home. Romania players bundle on top of Papp in celebration of his second goal in the 79th minute . Chris Brunt (left), Kyle Lafferty (centre) and Oliver Norwood (right) look on dejected after Northern Ireland were undone . Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill saw his side lose their first qualifier . But the striker lost his footing at the crucial moment, fluffing his connection completely from five yards and allowing Chris Baird to mop up. Goal threat at the other end was virtually non-existent but the willing Lafferty did serve a warning just before the break, muscling through on the left and working Ciprian Tatarusanu at his near post. Stancu paid the price for his earlier miss, hooked at half-time in favour of Claudiu Keseru. Keseru had been on the field seven minutes when his measured pass put the overlapping Razvan Rat one on one with Carroll. He attempted a delicate chipped finish but Carroll guessed right, standing tall and smothering the shot with his chest. Sanmartaen should have won a penalty just after the hour, dribbling into the area again and tumbling to the floor after McGivern left his foot out. But the referee was unimpressed or unsighted and play moved on. O'Neill attempted to shore things up by replacing McGinn with the defensively minded Sammy Clingan, but the resistance finally came to an end 16 minutes from time. Rat played provider, whipping in an awkward cross from left wing that McAuley could only fling a trailing leg at. The ball landed nicely for Papp and he left Carroll no chance from 10 yards. That knocked the stuffing from Northern Ireland and it was no surprise to see a second goal five minutes later, Papp again arriving in the right place to nod home Sanmartaen's cross at the far post. There was no coming back now, with Billy McKay's late arrival as a second striker merely window dressing.

"Amid the din and the disapproving cat calls making their way down from The Jungle, Wayne Rooney will deliver his final instructions at Celtic Park. It is on the field, in the moments before Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson gets this clash with Scotland under way, when England’s players will wrap their arms around each other. The pre-match huddle is famous at Celtic — started here in the 90s when Tony Mowbray was captain of the club. On Tuesday, it is guaranteed to provoke a different reception. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Scotland vs England: Sportsmail's international  preview . There is a growing sense of maturity about England's Wayne Rooney ahead of the game against Scotland . Tony Mowbray started the pre-match huddle at Celtic Park in the 90s and Rooney will lead his on Tuesday night . Arsenal trio Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Kieran Gibbs and Theo Walcott were out the pitch at Celtic Park . England manager Roy Hodgson was out to inspect the Celtic Park pitch with his players on Monday . Rooney admitted he had spoken to the younger players in the group about the atmosphere they should expect . ‘Up to now I have spoken and a few of the lads have jumped in after, which is great,’ revealed Rooney. ‘It shows everyone wants to be vocal. It’s something we will continue to do and it’s really a reminder of the messages we have heard all week. What is said is between us.’ On Tuesday evening, in the famous stadium’s fevered atmosphere, the captain will have to shout to make himself heard. It promises to be full volume. Away from the pitch there have been some softer tones, with Rooney taking some of the younger players to one side and explaining the competitive nature of this fixture over the past few days. Nathaniel Clyne, Kieran Gibbs, Jordan Henderson, Danny Welbeck, Adam Lallana and Raheem Sterling were in the team that beat Slovenia 3-1 on Saturday. None of them faced Scotland at Wembley last August. There is a growing sense of maturity about Rooney these days and he is increasing in authority as captain. When the Football Writers’ Association presented him with a cut glass crystal ball to commemorate his 100th appearance, his face was visibly moved by the sentiment. Former Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster, who played at the ground for four years, could start against Scotland after Joe Hart pulled out . Rooney, who is just six goals short of becoming England's record goalscorer, speaks to the media alongside his manager Hodgson . The England squad looked relaxed ahead of the game but Rooney knows the atmosphere will play a big part . At Celtic Park on Monday night he graciously handed over an England shirt, signed by the whole squad, to a reporter who is heading for sunnier climes after this game. He then skilfully and respectfully body-swerved a question about any ambitions to finish his career north of the border. ‘Some great players, the likes of Roy Keane, who I played with, have come here, but it’s not something I’d talk about now,’ he added. ‘I’m focused on England and Manchester United.’ Intriguingly, he appears more at home with the national team these days than he does at Old Trafford under Louis van Gaal. At the age of 29, his future responsibility is to use his experience and standing in the team to help draw the best out of the players being promoted to the squad. He has been there, seen it and not quite done it on the biggest stage of all. A fine legacy would be to tease the potential out of the younger players in this squad. It seems faintly ridiculous to describe him as a pastoral figure, but that is what he is becoming around the England camp as he prepares to play for the 101st time. An empty Celtic Park may not look too intimidating, but England will find themselves in a hostile environment . England's younger players, including Ross Barkley and Nathaniel Clyne (centre) will be in for a big test, according to their captain . More experienced players like Phil Jagielka and James Milner will have to help their younger team-mates adapt to the atmosphere . He also spoke warmly about his United team-mate Darren Fletcher, showing support for the Scotland midfielder after his successful recovery from a long-standing bowel condition. ‘First of all it’s incredible for him to be playing again and to be back in Scotland’s team,’ he added. ‘It shows the character and the type of player he is. Obviously it was hard for Darren and his family, but he’s come through that with flying colours. ‘He doesn’t miss a training session. He’s fit and he’s ready to play, but he’s playing for Scotland and I’m playing for England. ‘We’re great friends off the pitch, but for 90 minutes we’re opponents.’ There is a sense of occasion about this fixture, a grand affair at one of Europe’s sporting cathedrals. It should be a humdinger. Rooney’s best memory of the fixture dates back 18 years, when England midfielder Paul Gascoigne — then a Rangers player — scored one of the great international goals. ‘The biggest memory for me is Paul Gascoigne’s goal at Euro 96,’ he added. ‘That is the highlight from the games I’ve seen, but there will be many more before I was born. That goal is still fresh for me.’ Another one like that would certainly silence Celtic Park. The England manager looks focused as he strides out onto the Celtic Park pitch, with a banner behind him to remind Hodgson where he is .","England will face Scotland in a friendly at Celtic Park on Tuesday night .

"Some family doctors are already being paid £200 to diagnose dementia - more than four times the amount to be offered under a controversial new government proposal. GPs get the extra money if they identify patients with the condition and then implement a care plan to help them. The £200 payments - made to doctors in Bristol - were already in place months before Wednesday's pledge by ministers to dramatically improve rates of dementia diagnosis. GPs in Bristol are already being paid £200 to diagnose patients with dementia and develop a care plan - four times as much as the Government's £55 'cash for diagnosis' scheme which was announced on Wednesday . NHS Bristol Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which runs GP practices in the area, has offered GPs a £200 'bonus' payment if they increase their diagnosis rates by 5 per cent, or if they reach a target of 65 per cent of  dementia diagnosis expected in the area. This is on top of rewarding practices with £500 for signing up to a voluntary scheme brought in last year which required GPs to screen at-risk patients for dementia. 48 out of 55 GP practices in Bristol opted into the local scheme. Defending the payment, NHS Bristol CCG told Pulse magazine the bonus was set up to support family doctors taking on dementia care from specialists. The payments are also so GPs have extra resources to diagnose patients and review their care, it added. The news comes after ministers announced on Wednesday that GPs would be paid £55 for every patient they diagnose with dementia under a controversial new scheme. It is being rolled out by the NHS due to concerns that family doctors are picking up less than half of all cases. Around 850,000 patients in Britain are thought to have dementia but only 45 per cent have had a formal diagnosis. This has partly been blamed on an attitude of fatalism among doctors and patients who assume the diagnosis is pointless as so little can be done. Doctors already get extra money for performing a host of medical checks on such as blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes. The Patient's Association said the Government's proposal to pay GPs for diagnosing dementia is a 'step too far' and will mean 'rewarding poor GPs' But the new payments for diagnosing dementia have been heavily criticised by the Patient's Association who said it was 'rewarding poor GPs'. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: 'We know GPs receive incentive payments to find all sorts of conditions, such as high cholesterol, raised blood pressure and diabetes - but this seems a step too far. 'It is putting a bounty on the head of certain patients. 'Good GPs will be diagnosing their dementia patients already. This seems to be rewarding poor GPs. It is a distortion of good medical practice. 'There is an issue of people presenting late with dementia to doctors, but this is not the right way to go about tackling that. 'If people were given hope that something could be done, that would be the greatest incentive for coming early.' The Taxpayer's Alliance also spoke out against incentivising GPs to make certain diagnoses. Around 850,000 patients in Britain are thought to have dementia but only 45 per cent have had a formal diagnosis (file picture) Campaign Manager Andi Silvester said: 'Aren't GPs already paid to diagnose diseases and illnesses via their wages? 'It seems bizarre that you would hand out extra payments to GPs just because the patient walking through the door has dementia rather than a sore throat. 'Spotting dementia is a worthy goal, but we'd expect GPs to do it as part of the job they're already compensated for. 'There are also obvious, inherent risks to encouraging certain diagnoses over others.' But the criticism was dismissed as unfair by doctors who claim it will help, not hinder, diagnosis. Dr Nick Cartmell, a GP in Devon and part of the South West support team for dementia, said: 'What we are recognising is that general practitioners are in an ideal position to provide quality care to our patients with dementia and which is a new type of care that we haven't provided in the past. 'Therefore it is entirely appropriate that that care has investment attached to it.' The scheme encourages GPs to increase their understanding and awareness of dementia and local services, he said. It will teach them how to pursue a diagnosis, support patients through that process and how to help them after they've been diagnosed, he added. He said: 'We need to look at this in the bigger picture, we don't have that many people who have a deep a profound understanding of the politics behind dementia care. 'Not many people understand the pressure at the moment for us to increase diagnosis rates, which is political pressure, not from good medical practice. 'If we had all that out in the open people could judge for themselves.' The national scheme is understood to be the first country-wide initiative to offer doctors financial rewards for diagnosing patients with any condition.","Ministers this week announced scheme to pay GPs £55 per diagnosis .

"Manchester United Starlet James Wilson has revealed that Wayne Rooney outshines the likes of Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao during training by scoring more stunning goals than any of his team-mates.

"Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink’s reign as Burton Albion manager started perfectly with a 3-1 win at fellow League Two promotion candidates Wycombe. The Dutchman’s appointment as successor to Gary Rowett raised a few eyebrows but this victory and the performance that delivered it will encourage all at the Pirelli Stadium. On the evidence of this impressive win at Adams Park, delivered thanks to goals from Phil Edwards, Alex MacDonald and Jacob Blyth, they can definitely mount an assault on the automatic promotion places. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink applauds his new players during his first game in English management . Phil Edwards gave the former Leeds forward a great start, heading home from a corner to make it 1-0 . Paul Hayes turns the ball in, but his effort was rightly ruled out for offside, as Wycombe tried to fight back . Wycombe: Ingram, Jombati, Rowe, Mawson, Jacobson, Bloomfield (Craig 81), Murphy, Kretzschmar (Lewis 46), Wood (Cowan-Hall 46), Ephraim, Hayes (c) Subs not used:  Richardson. Scorer: Hayes penalty 65 . Booked: Lewis . Burton: McLaughlin; Edwards, Mousinho (c), Cansdell-Sherriff, McCrory, Lenihan, MacDonald, McGurk (Weir 68), Palmer, Beavon (Taft 90+5), Akins (Blyth 65) Subs not used: Weale, Knowles, Slade, Harness . Scorers: Edwards 37; McDonald 48; Blyth 68 . Booked: Edwards, Lenihan, Mousinho . Referee: Graham Scott . Attendance: 3,981 . With just a few days to find his feet at the Staffordshire club and get to know his squad, this was as good a performance as Hasselbaink could have wished for and a foundation stone upon which to build. It was not the most auspicious of starts. The Burton team coach was stuck in traffic on its journey down to Adams Park and arrived a little later than scheduled, though Hasselbaink, looking dapper in dark suit and club tie, was still all smiles for the waiting Sky Sports cameras upon arrival. It seemed the Brewers’ socks had gone missing, or somehow clashed, and so they stepped out in a mismatched ensemble of yellow shirts, black shorts and light blue socks borrowed from their hosts. And to complete Hasselbaink’s initiation into League Two football, his team booted the ball straight out from the kick-off. Things could only improve. The small knot of 87 travelling fans from Burton gave the new manager their full and vocal backing from the outset, singing his name in repetition to a booming drum beat for the first 10 minutes. Hasselbaink has inherited a strong team from Rowett, who jumped ship to Championship Birmingham City late last month, and Burton sat fifth in the standings after the weekend’s action. Stuart Beavon holds off Alfie Mawson as Hasselbaink's side moved up to fourth in the League Two table . Jon McLaughlan makes a good save to preserve Burton's lead on Monday night at Adams Park . Hasselbaink emerges from the tunnel at Adams Park to begin life as manager of League Two Burton . Wycombe, meanwhile, have enjoyed a real renaissance after last season’s relegation dogfight and Gareth Ainsworth’s men had the opportunity to leapfrog Luton and Shrewsbury and return to the summit with three points. Unsurprisingly it was they who set the tempo in the opening stages and captain Paul Hayes directed a Hogan Ephraim cross from the right narrowly wide with his knee. As Wycombe continued to press, Hasselbaink moved from his seat on the bench to stand, cross-armed, in his technical area, occasionally pointing a finger and bellowing an instruction. The Chairboys continued to push forward - Alfie Mawson took a nice touch but could only fire over before Matt Bloomfield’s cross was flicked on initially by the impressive Ephraim and then wide by Hayes. So it was firmly against the run of play that Burton took the lead on 38 minutes. If Hasselbaink goes on to achieve at Burton this will be remembered as the first goal of his epoch and a decent one it was too. Matty Palmer swung in a corner and there was Edwards arriving right on cue to thump home a header. Hasselbaink responded coolly with a brief round of applause. The fans were again singing his name as the whistle went for half-time and he responded with an appreciative wave. Paul Hayes pulled one back for Wycombe from the penalty spot, but Burton responded quickly . The new Burton manager signs a shirt outside the ground for a fan with an old Chelsea jersey . It got even better shortly after the break with a second goal out of the Dutch football school. Palmer split the Wycombe defence with a diagonal through ball and MacDonald slotted the ball through the keeper’s legs. Things were all going a bit too well and Wycombe halved the deficit on 65 minutes when Ephraim was fouled inside the box. Hayes smashed home the penalty and the momentum looked as though it was about to shift, especially when Ephraim headed over when well placed. Nothing changed. Three minutes later, Damien McCrory swung in a ball from the left and Blyth, only just introduced from the bench, rose highest to head home and restore Burton’s two-goal cushion. Hayes saw a goal disallowed for offside before Blyth almost added his second from a Palmer cross but goalkeeper Matt Ingram scooped the ball away. There was plenty of excitement around the former Premier League star trying his hand in the lower leagues . A lengthy injury stoppage, which saw Wycombe’s Mawson hobble off, led to 11 minutes of stoppage time but Burton weren’t unduly troubled again and Hasselbaink celebrated with a beaming smile and a wave to his family in the stands. Speaking on Sky Sports, Hasselbaink said: 'It was a really good group performance. We were solid in a lot of aspects of the game, at times we passed it well. 'I will try to get as much knowledge as possible [about League Two] and see as many games as possible, get to know the players. I knew a fair bit but it's always good to get to know more. There will be many night when I'll be in the stands watching. 'We'll take the confidence from this and we have another difficult one next week - Luton at home. It's a different game, a battle and the boys will be up for it.'","Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink takes charge of first Burton game .

"Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed that Sergio Garcia kept thanking him for selling Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid during the Ryder Cup. The former Manchester United manager gave a 30-minute talk to Europe’s team at Gleneagles before answering questions from Garcia, Rory McIIroy and Co. Ferguson is keeping what he said a secret but insists Real Madrid fan Garcia was delighted with United’s decisions to sell Ronaldo to the Spanish giants for £80million in 2009. Sir Alex Ferguson gave a motivational talk to the European team ahead of the Ryder Cup earlier this year . Ferguson, speaking to world No 1 Rory McIlroy at this year's Ryder Cup in Scotland . Sergio Garcia, in action at the Turkish Airlines Open, thanked Ferguson for selling Cristiano Ronaldo . Ferguson's full interview appears in The Big Issue . Speaking to the Big Issue, Ferguson said: ‘When Paul McGinley first approached me about going up to Gleneagles, we agreed that what was said in the dressing room stayed in the dressing room. That’s the way I’ve always operated. 'But it’s OK for me to tell you that I talked mainly about how to cope with being a favourite, just like we usually were at United. I also spoke with the caddies and with the players’ wives about different things. ‘But the banter was great. I mean, Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell are season-ticket holders at Old Trafford but Ian Poulter supports Arsenal, Thomas Bjorn supports Liverpool, Lee Westwood supports Nottingham Forest and Sergio Garcia is a huge Real Madrid fan. He kept thanking me for transferring Cristiano Ronaldo! ‘But really my main contribution was to encourage everyone to be calm over the seven days. When United were involved in big games, I always tried to help the team think it was just another day until we got right down to business. Outside of football, the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles was the greatest sporting challenge in which I’ve been involved.’ Cristiano Ronaldo has starred at Real Madrid since he signed for the Spanish giants five years ago . Since retiring from football at the end of the 2012-2013 campaign, Ferguson has also been lecturing at Harvard University and revealed his concerns over whether Paul Scholes would make it as a footballer due to his small stature. He said: ‘We talked a bit about how you pick the stars of the future and nurture them, something I’ve done all my life in football. I was very aware that the first time I clapped eyes on Paul Scholes, I thought, ‘too small’. 'But that’s when nurturing talent comes in. And you’re rewarded hugely. It’s a fantastic challenge but I’m speaking mostly about leadership and I’m comfortable doing that.’ Ferguson is still involved in football as chairman of the Elite Club Coaches Forum and as a member of the Champions League and European Championship technical study group – meaning he remains instrumental in the future direction of the game. He added: ‘Right now we’re looking at the possibility of introducing sin-bins like they have in rugby; a ten-minute suspension during the match. But we want to be careful that somehow it isn’t exploited if it’s introduced. 'We’re also looking at wiping out bookings when teams reach the latter stages of a cup competition. We lost Darren Fletcher from the 2009 Champions League Final against Barcelona and also missed Keane and Scholes for picking up cards in the 1999 Champions League Final against Bayern Munich. 'Now, they’d all played in all the previous rounds so it wasn’t fair that they missed out. We’ll see on that one. We’re also looking at allowing eleven substitutes on the bench for big finals in Europe. That way you can recognise the contribution the squad’s made and allow a wider range of substitutions.'

"Bosnia-Herzegovina have sacked coach Safet Susic after a terrible start to their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign that has seen them earn just two points from four matches. The poor run culminated in Sunday's 3-0 defeat by Israel, leaving their chances of reaching the 24-nation tournament hanging by a thread. 'The Bosnian football association (NFSBIH) thanks Susic for the historic achievement of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup and it will never be forgotten,' said the governing body's general secretary Jasmin Bakovic. Bosnia-Herzegovina have sacked coach Safet Susic after a terrible start to their Euro 2016 qualifiers . Susic was criticised for his tactics and team selection in Bosnia's group stage exit from the June 12-July 13 tournament in Brazil and came under more pressure after a shock 2-1 home defeat by Cyprus in their Euro 2016 qualifying Group B opener. The 59-year old former international forward, who scored 21 goals in 54 appearances for communist Yugoslavia, was granted a stay of execution after draws with Wales and Belgium but the Israel rout proved to be the final straw. Bitter after the NFSBIH executive board unanimously relieved him of his duties, Susic said he was convinced Bosnia would have stood a better chance of reaching the European Championship finals if he had stayed in charge. 'I won't feel accountable if we don't qualify because the prospect of winning five of the six remaining matches and clinching a berth should be realistic,' he told Bosnian media. Susic said he will take some time off from football before taking 'one of the offers that have come my way' 'I hope the football association made the right decision while I will take a short break and then accept one of the offers that have come my way in the past few months.' Asked if he regretted not stepping down after the World Cup, Susic said: 'No. I wanted to take the national team to Euro 2016 after reaching the World Cup but the football association's faith evaporated after the Cyprus defeat.' Having taken over in 2009, Susic suffered a pair of successive playoff defeats by Portugal, in 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 qualifying, before the Balkan nation hailed him as hero when they secured a 2014 World Cup berth. But falling out with top scorer Edin Dzeko in a 2-0 friendly defeat by Egypt in March seemed to be a turning point as Bosnia failed to reproduce their qualifying form at the World Cup finals and then made a woeful start in Euro 2016 qualifying.","Bosnia and Herzegovina were beaten 3-0 by Israel on Sunday .

"It is the erotic novel that has housewives across the globe spluttering into their tea - and has sent sales of Kindles soaring 71 per cent. EL James' Fifty Shades of Grey, dubbed 'Mummy porn' for its appeal to the average married mother, has reignited the trend for erotic fiction - and has got everyone, even fellow bonkbuster authors - talking. Last week Jilly Cooper went on the record to say that whether EL James's trilogy was well-written or not was debatable - but what was certain was that the author had done writers like her a service by putting the bonkbuster back on the map. Disappointed: Lace author Shirley Conran says 'Mummy porn' trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey is 'infantile' And now, Shirley Conran, author behind Eighties erotic hit Lace, has joined the conversation, coming out to discuss the racy trilogy ahead of the re-release of her book this summer. The 79-year-old author has hit out at the Fifty Shades trilogy, saying it does not deserve the moniker Mummy porn. Instead, she says, the books are more worthy of the nickname 'baby porn', owing to the absence of any real boudoir action. Speaking to The Times Magazine, Ms Conran was disdainful of the global bestseller, calling it 'infantile' and expressing her disappointment with how long it took before any real S&M was introduced. 'It's more like baby porn,' she said. 'You have to wait until page 200 for any sex at all. She doesn't get her bottom spanked until page 400.' E. L. James nets herself £862,069 per week for the novel which has gripped the nation . Ms Conran also repeated a popular criticism of the trilogy, which Ms James initially published herself using Kindle's self-publication tool, saying that the prose was 'jerky' and needed 'a good edit'. Of course, Ms Conran is not unaware that the success of Fifty Shades Of Grey has paved the way for the re-release of her own erotic works. But she has her own theory as to why the sadomasochistic theme of the Fifty Shades trilogy has so successfully captured the imagination of women today. She thinks women are aroused by submission because 'so many women have experienced patriarchal violence from their fathers'. 'I certainly did,' she admits. 'Not that it made me find it erotic later in life.","Conran, 79, says the writing is 'jerky' and needs a 'good edit'

"Premier League clubs have unanimously passed new legislation designed to improve pathways and opportunities for black and minority ethic employment in football. Clubs signed up on Thursday to a package of new equality measures which will make enhanced training and recruitment processes mandatory rather than voluntary at all levels. They will also guarantee to ensure that in future at least a quarter of the intake on the Premier League’s top coaching course, the Elite Coaching Apprenticeship Scheme (ECAS), will be black and minority ethnic. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has recently become the new manager of Burton Albion . Kieron Dyer (centre), currently a coach at Ipswich, recently said he was not in favour of the Rooney Rule . Former Premier League striker Jason Roberts holds strong views on the issue of racism in football . This year’s intake of 20 ECAS coaches included three black and ethnic minority (BME) coaches and was boosted by another three to ensure the percentage was met, and it will be maintained in future, with a pledge to help those coaches into a network which will guarantee them job at top-level clubs. The changes stop some way short of the Rooney Rule, introduced in the NFL which demands one BME candidate on every job opportunity short list. It has been credited with increasing the number of black and ethnic minority coaches in the game. Keith Curle, manager of League Two Carlisle United, is one of only three black bosses in the top four divisions . Chris Powell took over the helm at Huddersfield after a stint in charge at former club Charlton . But the Premier League has set the momentum rolling by changing its legislation. In practice, the opportunities with the ECAS programme will have an impact because this is an integral coach education element of the Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP). ECAS, in it's second year, involves one coach, hand picked by each of the 22 clubs with Category One academy status. They are then immersed in a programme which includes visits to elite training environments like British Cycling, Athletic Bilbao, the University of Bath and the Royal Shakespeare Company. They will also visit the SAS and McLaren F1 team.","Premier League clubs have passed a new legislation to improve access and opportunities for black and ethnic minority coaches in the game .

"Manchester United will on Tuesday reveal the first definitive figures on the financial cost of missing out on the Champions League. The club have estimated revenues will fall this season by between £38million and £48m - a drop of between 8.77 per cent and 11 per cent on last season's overall revenue figure of £433m - as a result of not being in Europe. The publication of the club's first quarter results for the financial year 2014-15 should provide accurate figures about an overall percentage drop in income. Wayne Rooney and Co's failure to qualify for the Champions League will hit the club's revenue . Both the income streams from broadcasting revenue and matchday revenue - which were both £19.3m for the first quarter of the 2013-14 financial year - can expect to take a hit. Broadcasting revenue will suffer due to no money at all coming in from UEFA - it was worth €44.7million (£35.7m) to United in 2013-14 - while matchday income will be affected because there will be no European matches compared to 10 last season which were worth around £20m combined. The first quarterly figures, covering the three months ending September 30, 2014, will be announced around noon on Tuesday, with United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward taking part in a conference call with investors an hour later. Ed Woodward will take part in conference call with United investors after results are revealed . The announcement will also show how much United have been able to soften the financial blow of missing out on Europe in terms of the club's steady rise in income from sponsorship and other commercial deals.

"A man who lost half his face to cancer is rebuilding his life after surgeons used 3D printing technology to make him a prosthesis. Eric Moger, 60, had to have almost all of the left side of his face removed after he was diagnosed with an aggressive tennis ball-sized tumour. The life-saving surgery left a gaping hole in his face, leaving him unable to speak clearly. He also had to be fed through a tube. Eric Moger, 60, (with fiance Karen) had most of the left side of his face removed after he was diagnosed with an aggressive tennis-ball sized tumour . Eric and fiance Karen, pictured on a night out before Eric's cancer, which was discovered at an advanced stage during a routine operation . For four years, he had to be fed through a tube directly into his stomach and was unable to speak clearly . Eric was fitted with a new prostethic face after appearing on Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies with fiance Karen . But four years later, after appearing on Channel 4’s Embarrassing Bodies, Mr Moger has been fitted with a new prosthetic face and is planning to marry his fiance Karen Hunger, 48. His new face - believed to be the first of its kind in the UK - was made using pioneering 3D printing technology. This uses scans to build images of how his face should look - using a mirror image of the undamaged side of the face. The new 3D printer then built a nylon mould of his face layer by layer - and this was used to create a silicon prosthesis. Mr Moger, from Waltham Abbey, Essex, was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma - which occurs when small growths called polyps grow into tumours - four years ago. By the time the lump was discovered - during a routine operation to remove nasal polyps - the cancer was very advanced. In order to save his life, surgeons at University College London Hospital removed his left eye, cheekbone and most of his jaw. As a result, he had to be fed through a feeding tube and had to hold his face still to be able to talk. He was referred to dental surgeon, Andrew Dawood who used digital scanning technology to scan his face . Mr Dawood created scans of what was left of Eric's skull and then used computers to create a mirror image of the unaffected side of the face to show what his face would look like with a prosthesis . Mr Moger told MailOnline: 'When I went in for the emergency surgery, I never expected to have so much of my face removed. 'When I woke up from thought ""I'm never going to get my face back again"". It was so shocked that it didn't sink in for a while.' But in the weeks and months that followed, he felt increasingly depressed about his appearance and quality of life. 'I couldn't eat as food just came out of the side of my face - and I had to hold my mouth to talk,' he said. 'I felt very depressed as couldn't see how anything was ever going to change. I didn't want to get out of bed.' Mr Dawood then used 3D printing technology to create a nylon plastic mould from which he could create the silicon prosthesis . Eventually, in desperation, the couple decided to visit Dr Christian Jessen on Embarrassing Bodies to see if there was any hope. Mr Moger was referred to dental surgeon Andrew Dawood, at Dawood and Tanner Dental Practice in London. Mr Dawood created a mouth implant (pictured) which creates a seal meaning that Eric can eat and drink again . Mr Dawood used digital scanning technology to scan Mr Moger’s face. He then used digital software to create a model of the unaffected side of his face. From this model, he was able to use 3D printing technology to create a mirror image of the undamaged side of the face. The new 3D printer then built a nylon mould of his face layer by layer - and this was then used to create a silicon prosthesis. Mr Moger now wears the facial prosthesis and a mouth implant which is used to separate the mouth from the hole in his face. This creates a seal which means he can eat and drink again. The prosthesis is supported by titanium scaffolding that is held in place by screws in his eyebrow and in his other cheek bone, Mr Dawood told MailOnline. Magnets help secure the silicon mask in place and make it easy to remove at night. Since having the prosthesis fitted, Mr Moger has eaten his first meal in five years - Weetabix and hot milk. He said: 'I have lost my sense of smell, but I could still taste some of it. And I no longer have to hold my mouth to talk any more. It's . transformed my life. 'It is a great feeling to look in the mirror and see a whole face again. I am amazed at what they have done  - it just looks so like me. I also have something to look forward to, as Karen and I are planning to finally get married this summer.' Eric can now eat, drink and speak clearly again and is awaiting further treatment to add teeth to his implant . Describing . the moment when the prosthesis was fitted, Ms Hunger said: ‘It was unbelievable, I’ve got him back. 3D printers allow objects of any shape to be created from . just a digital file. They work in an extremely simple way, by building up a 3D . object from layers of material. Like a traditional inkjet printer, material, usually . plastic, is laid down on a base. Further layers are simply printed on top, gradually . revealing a 3D object. The technology is used in a huge range of industries from . construction to aerospace. Shoes, jewellery and even dresses have been created, with . designs often sold online. Many believe it could even lead to 'mini factories' for . living rooms allowing consumers to print anything they want - from a bracelet . to a replacement part for a broken household  appliance. ‘Hopefully he can now go out with his friends to the pub; it will give him a real confidence boost.’ She added: 'His appearance before didn't bother me. Who I fell in love with is in here, this bit is just the outside. He hasn't changed on the inside. ‘Eric is now completely cured of the cancer so you have to take some things to gain others. 'It is so good to see him happy again and what it has done for his confidence. 'People did stare at him . before but I think the main problem was he felt so low, he didn't want . to get out of bed. Now, he is out in the garden and is happy to go out . to the shops.' She added: ‘It’s not been easy. I have down days but family support helps me and my granddaughter Amelia brightens up my days. ‘She is great with Eric, she is only three and never frightened of him, it’s remarkable.’ The next stage of Mr Moger’s treatment will see him return to Mr Dawood’s clinic where he will have teeth fitted to his implant. He will even receive a prosthesis in a darker tone for summer, when his skin tans. Ms Hunger added: ‘We want to tell our story and show . others that life isn’t all doom and gloom and that there are ways of . curing these things; there is a light at the end of the tunnel.'","Eric Moger had a large part of his face removed after developing a tumour .

"Whatever you do, don’t mention fried chicken. Yes, The Bluegrass State serves visitors everything from fried catfish to succulent steaks and pecan pie, but it has so much more to offer than food. ‘We love rivers, mountains, old men, pretty horses and fast women,’ reads a tongue-in-cheek poster in a cafe window in Frankfort, the state capital, a gracious old-world town ringed by meadowland, pine forests and stud farms. America at its most picturesque: Kentucky's appeal is encapsulated by the pretty town of Midway . Kentucky is the horse capital of America, and the highlight of the year is the running of the Kentucky Derby on the first Saturday in May. But as we drive around the state, savouring the soft contours of the landscape, we glimpse an unchanging rural world. A plump, white horse grazes a meadow of buttercups. We pass a Baptist church, some white clapboard houses, a farmer and his dog, and a fluttering Stars and Stripes flag that has seen better days.

Then there’s the terrific General George Patton Museum of Leadership at Fort Knox, a genuinely inspirational place, especially for anyone interested in World War II. More than 90 per cent of the world’s bourbon is now produced in Kentucky and, whether you like the drink, or prefer Scotch, you should not miss a visit to one of the legendary distilleries on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. A thunder of hooves: America thrills to the spectacle of the Kentucky Derby, every May . One of the largest and best is Jim Beam, . which not only gives an excellent overview of the bourbon-making . process, but evokes the colourful history of the industry, from its . primitive origins to the dark days of Prohibition and up to the present. The tour ends with a full-on bourbon-tasting of which my memories are hazy. Bardstown, in the heart of bourbon country, is small-town America at its gracious best. Nobody rushes, cats sleep on porches. Our accommodation in Bardstown is the Beautiful Dreamer B&B, opposite the 19th-century mansion which inspired the song My Old Kentucky Home, a cornball classic that has been bringing tears to Kentuckian eyes for more than 150 years.

"Matthew Fludgate, 36, has been struck off by the National College for Teaching . A teacher who slept with his teenage pupil after the school prom has been banned from the classroom for life. Matthew Fludgate, 36, who taught at St Edmund Campion School, in Erdington, Birmingham, had sex with the 18-year-old in a hotel room after the party in May 2010. The former head of PE at the Catholic school was also accused of sending flirtatious text messages to another pupil, signed off with a series of kisses. In June 2011, Fludgate was found not guilty of charges of rape, sexual assault and another serious sexual offence by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court. But he has now been found guilty of ‘unacceptable professional conduct’ by the National College for Teaching (NCT), resulting in a lifelong ban from working as a teacher in any school, sixth form or college. A spokesman for the NCT said: 'The panel has found that Mr Fludgate has been responsible for having sexual intercourse with a pupil, which, like the panel, I consider to be serious sexual misconduct. 'Mr Fludgate has not shown insight into his actions. 'In my view therefore this is a case in which a review period would not be appropriate and as such I have decided that it would be proportionate in all the circumstances for the prohibition order to be without provision for a review period.' Speaking after the crown court verdict, Floodgate said the abuse allegations had destroyed his life. The court had been told that he had met with students at a Walkabout bar after the prom, despite the school telling teachers they were not to go out with students after the party.

The prosecution in the 2011 case, who told the court Fludgate had recently ended a relationship with a fellow teacher, claimed he later took an 18-year-old pupil, who was drunk, to a room he had booked earlier, in Birmingham's Broad Street Premier Inn, and forced her to have sex. But Fludgate said the teenager had come to the hotel after she had told him she had nowhere to stay that night and that they had consensual sex.

"Guide dog owners are scared of going out in London because of cyclists, a charity has said. There has been an increase in reports of those involved in a collision or a near-miss with someone on their bike, according to the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association. Research by the charity found that almost half of visually impaired people had been involved in a crash with a cyclist and three quarters who came close to it were due to people cycling on pavements or ignoring red lights at pedestrian crossings. Scroll down for video . Guide Dogs for the Blind Association found blind people are scared to go out in London because of cyclists . Rob Harris, from the association, said: ‘We work incredibly hard to get blind or partially sighted people out of their homes and mobile, so to hear that vision impaired people are anxious and in some cases fearful about going out in London because of irresponsible cyclists is very worrying. ‘With the Mayor committing nearly £913 million to a “cycling revolution” we need to make sure that cyclists are more aware of blind and partially sighted pedestrians.’ Partially sighted guide dog owner Deborah Persaud from Islington, Greater London was walking home from a tube station when she was hit by a bicycle. She said: ‘I was halfway along the road when I was struck by a cyclist coming towards me on the pavement. My dress was torn, the contents of my handbag damaged and I was left with damage to my shoulder and hip.’ Working in partnership with Transport for London and the London Cycling Campaign, Guide Dogs has launched the Cycleyes campaign, which says that every cyclist has a ‘duty of care to look out for other road user’. Charlie Lloyd, campaigns officer for the London Cycling Campaign, said: ‘Any crash or a close pass which frightens or intimidates a pedestrian is unacceptable. Far worse when that person is blind, partially sighted or in any was less able than we are.’ The survey found cyclists had been riding on pavements or ignoring red lights at crossings, causing collisions . Leon Daniels, Transport for London's managing director for Surface Transport, said: ‘It is vital on London's busy road network that we all understand and respect the needs and welfare of our fellow road users. ‘We support the Guide Dogs' campaign to remind cyclists and other road users to watch out for and give extra care to visually impaired and other vulnerable pedestrians. ‘This, together with the work being done to make pedestrian crossings more accessible with tactile paving and audible signals, will make London's roads safer for all.’ The campaign calls on riders to use their eyes ‘for those who can’t’ – by reminding them to use a bell or call out when they can see guide dog owners waiting to cross the road. It also asked cyclists not to ride up behind a guide dog in case it startled or confused them and dismount bikes if they need to go on the pavement for any reason. The results of the charity’s survey came from 33 of the 320 guide dog owners in London, where over 41,000 people are registered blind or partially sighted. And of those questioned, 14 said they had been involved in a collision and 25 had been in a near-miss.

"Diego Simeone has poured cold water on speculation linking him with a move away from Atletico Madrid, insisting he is happy at the club and that he has unfinished business with the Spanish champions. Simeone has seen his stock go sky-high since taking over at Atletico in 2011 and the Argentinian has recently seen his name mentioned in relation to possible moves to Manchester City and Paris St Germain should either of the European big-spenders decide on a coaching change. However, echoing the comments of Atletico president Enrique Cerezo over the weekend, Simeone has dismissed suggestions he may be on his way out of the Vicente Calderon any time soon, and says he is still looking at ways to make the Rojiblancos even better.

Peter Sariwee, a nurse, lost 7st in just four months after being shocked to see patients his age and size being brought to hospital after suffering heart attacks . Mr Sariwee dropped from 17st to 9st 7lbs and lost 10ins from his waist. He went from a size XXL to a small . To lose weight Mr Sariwee took up running and completely revolutionised his diet . Mr Sariwee told MailOnline: ‘When I saw these people being brought in it was upsetting to think it could be me. ‘I missed so much of my life being a couch potato – now I want to make up for it as I finally have my life back.’ Before he went on a diet, Mr Sariwee had been piling on the pounds gradually. He took no exercise and says he could not even run 100 meters. He also suffered breathlessness, lethargy and was constantly tired. He would eat a full English breakfast, two sandwiches and a bag of crisps for lunch and then pizza for dinner. Mr Sariwee (right before his weight loss) piled on the pounds on a diet of junk food and beer . He also snacked on three or four Mars bars a day as well as crisps and biscuits and drank at least two litres of Coca Cola every day. Mr Sariwee was also fond of a pint and would have 10 per night on Friday, Saturday and Sunday each week. BEFORE: . Breakfast: A full English breakfast . Lunch: Two sandwiches and a bag of crisps . Dinner: Pizza . Snacks: Four Mars bars a day, crisps and biscuits . Drinks: Up to 10 pints of beer and two litres of Coca Cola a day . AFTER: . Breakfast: A bowl of bran flakes . Lunch: Just fruit . Dinner: Chicken with salad . Snacks: Dried fruit and nuts . Drinks: Water and only an occasional beer . He eventually decided he had to change his lifestyle after being shocked to see patients the same age and size as him being brought into his hospital with heart problems. He explained that, as a nurse, he would take their details, including how much they ate, drank and weighed, and realised there were too many parallels between their lives and his. As a result, in 2010, Mr Sariwee decided to make some drastic changes. He took up running and has since run 31 marathons, including once running five marathons in five days. He also gave up chocolate and alcohol completely and started eating healthily. In just four months he lost 7st to drop to 9st 7lbs. He also dropped from a 36in waist to a 26in waist and fell from an XXL shirt to a small. Amazingly, he then decided he had actually gone too far as he started to look gaunt and noticed his cheekbones were protruding. So, he decided to put a stone back on – he is now happy weighing 10st 7lbs. Mr Sariwee, who met his wife Lisa during his diet, now has a bowl of bran flakes for breakfast, just fruit for lunch and a jacket potato with baked beans, or chicken with salad for dinner. Mr Sariwee (pictured before his weight loss) says he initially found it hard to diet as he craved chocolate . Since his weight loss Mr Sariwee has started running marathons and has run 31 to date . Before he lost weight, Mr Sariwee says he could not even run 100m . He snacks on fruit and nuts and just allows himself the occasional chocolate bar or beer. He says that he initially found his new diet very difficult to stick to as he craved alcohol and chocolate. However, he says it quickly became easier and that running continues to help him keep the weight off. He also explained he thinks the key to successful dieting is not to entirely deny oneself anything. He told MailOnline: ‘My wife has been my rock, she has supported me though everything and she is looking fantastic as she has also lost 2st. Mr Sariwee says he now feels much fitter and healthier and that he also has more confidence . Mr Sariwee never used to exercise at all but he says he now loves it and is almost addicted . ‘I now love running – especially after a stressful shift at work. It helps me clear my head. ‘It has become my stress-reliever. Words can’t explain what it is like to be out watching the sunrise on the fells when no one else is about.’ He added: ‘I feel a lot fitter now and I need much less sleep. ‘I can do all of the things I missed out on before – I feel like I’ve got my life back and I am much more confident. ‘I can now buy the clothes I want and I have the confidence to sit on a beach in just shorts without worrying.’ Mr Sariwee is soon to take part in a 69 mile ultra marathon along Hadrian's Wall . Mr Sariwee says he now hopes to stay at his current weight and intends to avoid weight gain by running . Mr Sariwee says people’s reactions to his sudden weight loss were inspiring. He explained: ‘I lost the weight so quickly that people have had to do a double take to check it’s really me.’ He added: ‘The best thing about the whole experience has been meeting new running friends – it makes me feel really good and the running is like an addiction now.’ On June 21 Mr Sariwee will be taking part in a 69 mile, 24 hour run along Hadrian’s Wall. The event is Rat Race’s The Wall Ultra Marathon.","Peter Sariwee dropped from 17st to 9st 7lbs and lost 10ins from his waist .

"Gary Neville had barely digested his first breakfast under the new world order when he waded into an online debate with those who thought England should simply try to copy the way Germany produce footballers. Those people are either ‘oblivious to the obstacle’ or they ‘believe in magic wands’, rapped Neville on Twitter. ‘You might as well say England needs weather like Spain.’ He claimed Germany’s ‘holistic approach’ could not be transported across the North Sea and added: ‘We are going to have to find our way of doing it because the system we have doesn’t allow us to adopt the German route in its entirety.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gary Neville leading an England training session . New world order: Germany celebrate their first World Cup in 24 years . Fronting up: Gary Neville admits England are unable to copy Germany's model for success . Germany’s first World Cup triumph in 24 years has aggravated some unhealed wounds. It is not simply the bitter football rivalry but the painful proof that England are being left behind as others accelerate and are losing the ability to convert our raw materials into footballers of genuine world-class ability. At the heart of Germany’s victory in Brazil is the fact that six of those selected by Joachim Low for the final before Sami Khedira’s injury in the warm-up – had started in the final of the European U21 Championships in 2009, when the Germans had beaten England 4-0 in Malmo. Success stories: James Milner (left) and Joe Hart (centre) played for England in the European U21 Championships in 2009 . From the England team that day, only James Milner made it to Brazil, although Joe Hart is another who would have played for the U21s five years ago had he not been banned and Theo Walcott would have been at the World Cup but for injury. But it goes a little deeper. All but one of those who started for Germany in Malmo went on to play senior international football, including some who switched flags. Fabian Johnson played for the USA at the World Cup and Sebastian Boenisch played for Poland in the qualifiers. Ashkan Dejagah, who missed the final against England through suspension, was in Brazil with Iran. Switching sides: Ashkan Dejagah played for Germany's youth sides before declaring for Iran . Rising star: Toni Kroos is on the brink of a move to Real Madrid . Then there was Toni Kroos, the poster boy for the U21 Euros in 2009; a prolific young striker from Bayern Munich who was injured and unable to take part in the tournament. Germany got by without him, and Kroos developed into a midfielder, now on the brink of a move to Real Madrid. It was indeed an exceptional crop but, still, it goes deeper. Germany made the decision to deliberately restructure its youth development programme at the start of this century and these are the results coming to fruition. 'Other young players are coming,' warned Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German FA (DFB). Eyes on the prize: German chief Wolfgang Niersback is hoping for a years of domination . It’s true, in the same year that Germany’s U21s were winning in Malmo, their U17s were winning the European title with a team featuring a certain Mario Gotze, scorer of the only goal in the World Cup final. This could be an era of domination, as Low said, born out of a disappointing display (by their own standards) in Euro 2000, when they lost to Kevin Keegan’s England and the old foes were out together, after the group stage. England crossed their fingers and hoped players like Michael Owen, David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Paul Scholes and Frank Lampard would continue to progress at their clubs, while Germany went home and overhauled their Academy system to make sure the next generation was much better. Rock bottom: Germany started from scratch after their Euro 2000 exit . The advantage they had was that the DFB and the Bundesliga were almost one entity at the time and the governing body had power to force change upon its clubs. Strict regulations were imposed in youth development from 2001. He didn’t spell it out but this is probably Neville’s 'obstacle'. The relationship between the power brokers inside the English game is complicated by the rich history and the community roots of a 92-club pyramid. One of its biggest strengths has been its biggest weakness when it comes to international football. Dejected: Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard reflect on England's World Cup exit . As Germany sorted itself out, the FA did next to nothing and things conspired against them. They took an age to build St George’s Park and neglected coach education while clubs routinely denied young players release to play for their country at U19, U20 and U21 level and, in some cases, the players were happy to be denied it. At the same time, clubs made it harder for these young players to get into the first team by signing more foreign players and the development process stalled. The argument is well-worn and still everyone points fingers of blame at each other. The FA does one thing, the Premier League another and the world hurtles towards another season and the qualifying campaign for Euro 2016. VIDEO Neville for England - Owen . 'I’m confident the mountain is starting to move, but it’s a slow shift and results will take time,' said Neville, who perhaps understands (or represents) the confused forces as well as anyone in his dual role as England coach and Sky Sports analyst. As he tweeted away about Germany and England, Sky were confirming the matches being shunted around for live broadcast and issuing a press release in which Neville was quoted saying: 'I can’t wait for the new season and I can’t wait for Sky’s live matches. I can’t wait to get back into the studio.' Really? Others can’t wait for a major tournament when it’s not quite so embarrassing to be English, but, failing that, sure, bring on the Premier League. It will be great entertainment as ever and we can all do with the distraction.","Three Lions coach says English club system restricts youth development .

"Schalke's director of sport Horst Heldt says his club are not interested in signing either Andre Schurrle or Lukas Podolski this winter. Both Germany internationals are being linked with returns to the Bundesliga as neither are regular starters for their clubs Chelsea and Arsenal respectively.

"Like most people who lose a beloved pet, Nicole Green is grieving for her cat Poppy. The playful tabby arrived in Nicole’s life 15 years ago as a lively kitten and soon became a big part of her family. ‘Poppy was always such a boisterous little thing,’ says Nicole, 38, an insurance underwriter from Epping, Essex. ‘She loved being out in the garden and every summer I’d look out of the window and see her flying through the air trying to catch butterflies. Then at night she’d be so loving and would curl up close to me on my bed. That’s the thing I miss most, our snuggle time.’ Mourning: Nicole Green, 38, is grieving for her cat Poppy, 15, who was diagnosed with dementia last December . Nicole, who is married to James, 31, a fireman, and has three children, Macey, 14, Archie, seven, and George, eight weeks, admits that she wells up when she reminisces about her pet. But Poppy isn’t dead. She is one of more than 1.3 million British cats and dogs with dementia, which has a devastating effect on their lives — and those of their owners. ‘Every night it takes me two or three hours to try to settle her to sleep because she’s so distressed and doesn’t know where she is,’ says Nicole. ‘She’ll miaow loudly and pace up and down for ages before she sleeps. ‘In the morning I’ll come downstairs and whereas before she used to jump off the table and come purring around my legs, now she simply doesn’t respond. She just stares blankly back at me and it’s obvious she has no idea who I am. It breaks my heart. ‘She never used to have toilet accidents but now it happens most nights. Sometimes when the back door opens she will wander outside and I feel a huge sense of panic because if she gets lost, she won’t be able to find her way home again. She can’t even find her bowl.’ Snuggle time: Nicole cuddling Poppy (left) and Poppy as a kitten (right) Recent research from the University of Edinburgh found that half of all cats over the age of 15 and a third of those aged 11 to 14 suffer from dementia. Another study found that 41 per cent of dogs aged 14 and over and 23 per cent of those aged 12 and over also suffer. Although most studies so far have focused on cats and dogs, owners are reporting behaviour similar to dementia in a variety of animals, including rabbits, guinea pigs and even parrots. If your pet is eight or older, and you answer yes to one or more of these questions, consult your vet: . Does your pet pace or wander aimlessly, finding it hard to settle? Does it stare blankly as if unaware of surroundings? Does it fail to recognise or respond to familiar people such as family and friends? Does it get lost or confused in the home or garden? Is it forgetful — for example, forgetting to go to the toilet or repeatedly seeking attention? Does it vocalise repeatedly or for no reason? The irony is that the disease is actually a result of domestic animals living beyond their natural life expectancy, as loving owners pay out for expensive food, medication and surgery to keep their pets alive. ‘The main form of dementia in animals is called Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome, which is a degenerative brain disease remarkably similar to Alzheimer’s in humans,’ explains Jon Bowen, Honorary Lecturer in Small Animal Behaviour at the Royal Veterinary College, London. ‘As with humans, areas of the brain stop working properly which leads to problems with learning, memory, sleep patterns, social interaction  and continence.’ Bowen believes that, just as humans are increasingly suffering from dementia due to our rising life expectancy, our pets are being stricken by the disease because they are living longer than ever. The average dog now lives to the age of 12 and a cat to 14. So, to some extent, animal-loving owners are responsible for the rise in dementia. ‘Years ago we weren’t seeing pets live until 17 or 18 years of age and nowadays we do,’ says Mr Bowen. ‘Their brains aren’t evolved to live so long — they wear out.’ The rise is so sudden that animal insurer Petplan recently revealed claims for vet appointments regarding dementia have increased by 23 per cent for dogs and 48 per cent for cats over the last three years. Michael Davies, Associate Professor in Small Animal Clinical Practice at the University of Nottingham, says — as with humans — experts are still in the dark as to why some animals are afflicted and not others. ‘Loss of cognitive function with age in dogs and cats is associated with similar structural changes in the brain to people — an accumulation of a protein called amyloid in the brain tissue. ‘The amyloid accumulates within the nerve cells in the brain, altering how it functions.’ Heartache: Nicole says the affect of dementia on your pet, and your life as an owner, can be devastating . Nicole found out that Poppy had dementia . last December. Vets usually diagnose the condition after hearing about . the change in the pet’s behaviour, and undertaking a full physical . examination and a range of tests. Loving friend: As Poppy is not in pain Nicole and her family plan to make her comfortable until the end . Putting down a pet with serious dementia may be an option, particularly if they are in physical pain or injuring themselves. However, it is not always the kinder option, as senile pets can live perfectly comfortable lives. ‘Some days Poppy doesn’t even remember what she likes eating any more,’ says Nicole. ‘A few weeks ago she left a bowl of her favourite cat food and went into the living room and lapped baked beans off my son’s plate. She never liked them before. She also gets disorientated and walks round and round the garden like she’s trying to get her bearings. ‘Three months ago Poppy managed to squeeze through a gap in the fence and I found her wondering in the grounds of the local hospital looking lost. ‘We were told that there’s no medication we can give her. She’s not in pain so the kindest thing is to make her comfortable at home and spoil her. I’ll be her best friend to the end. She has been a loving friend to me.’ As well as the one million cats with dementia in the UK, there are 300,000 dogs who suffer from the condition, too. Janice Care’s 12-year-old Airedale terrier, Zoe, was diagnosed a year ago. ‘She was such an energetic and playful little dog,’ says Janice, 45, a housewife who is married to Steve, 48, a furniture manufacturer, and mum to Jade, 21, Rosie, 18 and Freddie, 16. ‘As she got older, she started to sleep more. Then a year ago we noticed her bumping into furniture and getting lost on walks, which was heartbreaking. Heartbroken: Janice Care, 45, and her Airedale terrier Zoe, 12, who was diagnosed with dementia a year ago . ‘We took her for a check-up and discovered she’d gone partially deaf and blind in her old age. ‘But something still didn’t add up and six months later Zoe started behaving oddly and barking for no reason.’ Janice, from Ongar, Essex, took Zoe back to the vet, who  diagnosed dementia. ‘We weren’t told about any medication that could help Zoe so we just got on with caring for her ourselves. It helps that we also have Darcie, a three-year-old schnoodle (a cross between a schnauzer and a poodle), and she encourages Zoe to get up and play. She even helps guide her round the house.’ Elderly pets: Zoe is one of 300,00 dogs in the UK who suffer from the condition, with 41 per cent of dogs aged over 14 suffering and 23 per cent of those aged 12 and over . Alison Stratford, 56, a research manager from Bracknell, Berkshire, cares for her mother Glenys, 88, who has Alzheimer’s. Alison realised her 20-year-old cat Toffee had dementia when he started displaying similar symptoms to her mother. Cat protection: Alison, 56, with her cat Toffee, 20 (left) and Toffee as a young cat (right) ‘My mother would often eat her dinner, I’d take the plate away, then sit down to eat mine and she’d shout and ask me, “Where’s my dinner?” She thought she hadn’t had it and wanted it again. ‘Toffee would do the same. He’d eat his dinner and instead of curling up and sleeping, he’d go back and stand by his bowl and miaow for it all over again. ‘I volunteer as a welfare officer for Cat Protection and I’m trained in cat health  so my heart sank. I knew it  was dementia.’ Surprisingly, despite the rise in pet dementia, it often goes under-reported by vets. Symptoms: Alison recognised Toffee was suffering from dementia because he started displaying similar behavior to Alison's mother, a dementia sufferer . ‘We may be detecting only about one in eight cases because signs of dementia just aren’t visible in a consultation,’ says Jon Bowen. ‘We rely on owners to spot the signs and tell us. If you diagnose a senile pet early, you can get in quickly and start treating them sooner with much better results. Just six months can see a pet decline rapidly.’ Some owners say pet dementia can be slowed down using games to exercise and stimulate their animals, although there is no cure. Gently stroking Poppy, who is now purring softly, Nicole knows only too well the heartache of suddenly ‘losing’ a pet to dementia. She says: ‘This is something every animal lover should be aware of. The impact on your pet — and your own life — can be devastating.’","Nicole Green's cat Poppy is one of 1.3m UK cats and dogs with dementia .

Texas teenager Justin Carter jailed since February after threatening to 'shoot up a school' on Facebook, has been released from prison after an anonymous donor posted the $500,000 bond . He was arrested after he got into an argument with someone over a multiple player online video game on the social networking site . But now he has been released after a mystery benefactor wired the money to his legal representation. He is now planning to stay near New Braunfels, Texas, to await his trial on a felony terroristic threat charge, NPR.org reports. If convicted he could face eight years in jail. Don Flanary, Carter's attorney, told the site: 'He's glad he's out. His family is ecstatic. He feels good. He is relieved. It's been an ordeal.' Justin's father, Jack Carter, has previously said that his son had clearly made the comments in jest. Although the teenager, who turned 19 while in prison, added 'lol' (laughing out loud) and 'jk' (just kidding) to his post, a woman from Canada who saw it reported Justin to police after finding out that he lived near an elementary school. Mr Carter has since been campaigning to have his son released, and wants to teach teenagers about the dangers of posting comments on social media. 'Justin was the kind of kid who didn't read the newspaper. He didn't watch television. He wasn't aware of current events. These kids, they don't realize what they're doing. They don't understand the implications. They don't understand public space,' he told KHOU.

Nicola Rizzoli will be able to look back on this final with pride as he performed well as did both of his assistants in a tough match. In any such game there are incidents to debate; perhaps Sergio Aguero’s challenge on Sebastian Schweinsteiger being the most obvious. The debate could only be whether the Manchester City striker should have seen straight red or his second yellow – either way he was extremely fortunate to finish the game. Manuel Neuer’s clash with Gonzalo Higuain was compared in commentary to the assault by Harold Schumacher on France’s Battiston in 1982 but for me the winner of this tournaments golden glove was blameless as he stretched to punch the ball away and his momentum caught his opponent. Calming nature: It was a fine refereeing performance from Nicola Rizzoli on Sunday night . Collision: Sergio Aguero was lucky to stay on the pitch after leading with his arm while on a yellow card . All worth it: Bastian Schweinsteiger was bloodied after a challenge with Sergio Aguero . Ouch: Manuel Neuer clatters into Gonzalo Higuain in the second half... he still earned his team a foul . Perhaps Rizzoli was wrong to give Germany a free kick when a throw-in seemed the right decision but he was under pressure at the time not to be seen to favour the South Americans – balance is vital in such tight affairs. In fact Rizzoli found the perfect balance all evening and used common sense when dealing with a seemingly concussed Cristoph Kramer. When medical experts tell you he is fine to continue you struggle to differ – perhaps something that FIFA or the IFAB should review. Rizzoli can certainly sit back in his plane seat back to Bologna and reflect on a great tournament and one in which he did all he could to apply laws even with FIFA restricting the use of disciplinary sanctions – something else that must change before 2018.

"They are the bits of tournament television coverage we love to watch but which we also dread, and in the battle of the World Cup 2014 montages BBC just shaded it over ITV. We all enjoy seeing the best bits of a tournament sped up and condensed into just a few minutes but with those montages comes the reality that the greatest football show on earth has come to a close. Brazil 2014 will be remembered for the goals, the utter humiliation of the hosts at the hands of Germany in the semi-finals, England's disastrous performance, as well as Luis Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini.

BBC's montage was more than double the length at four minutes and 51 seconds, while ITV's was just two minutes 18 seconds. Although this allowed the BBC to include more action, their package also involves a lot of dancing and pieces contributed by actors. This adds to the intrigue but it also takes away slightly from the best moments of the tournament - it takes one minute 15 seconds before any goals are shown. ITV on the other hand just head straight into the action from the off and show all of the goals and tournament best moments one after another. They also include some of the funniest studio moments which the BBC largely omit from their offering. Overall, the BBC's montage depicts more accurately the story of how the tournament progressed and, although it is a tad long, it just comes out on top.

"Diego Maradona took a swipe at Lionel Messi the day after his World Cup heartache by insisting the heir to his throne didn't deserve to win the Golden Ball award. Messi was welcomed home by Argentina President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who admitted she 'didn't see a single match', after Germany's 1-0 win at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday. And the four-time Ballon d'Or winner, who looked almost apologetic to be named player of the tournament, only won the award because of a 'marketing plan', says Maradona.

James Rodriguez (Colombia) - Despite playing just five games at the tournament, the Monaco forward scored six times and picked up the Golden Boot award. Thomas Muller (Germany) - Again a standout at a major tournament, he found the net on five occasions and was a constant threat for the eventual winners. Javier Mascherano (Argentina) - Different class in the middle of midfield as he took each game, particularly in the knockout stages, by the scruff of the neck and roared the South Americans on. Completed the most tackles of anyone at the World Cup. Manuel Neuer (Germany) - Hugo Lloris, beware. This man is the very definition of a sweeper-keeper. Barely put a foot wrong all tournament with a string of top saves and bossed his area like no other. Arjen Robben (Holland) - Although there were simulation antics, Robben's poise in possession and potency in front of goal were deciding factors in Louis van Gaal's team finishing third. 'I would give him any award, but when it's not fair and when marketing people make him win something that he didn't win, it's unfair,' said Maradona. 'Because (Arjen) Robben played an exceptional tournament and because Thomas Muller made an incredible sacrifice against Argentina. 'I feel sorry for my country. Mario Gotze’s goal really hurt. There’s a huge sadness in my heart that we lost the final. 'All things put together, I think Argentina deserved at least penalties. That Germany won was the result of a misunderstanding in the Argentine defence.' Maradona added on his television show, De Zurda: 'I could see he didn't want to go up and collect it.' Messi won the Golden Ball ahead of a number of arguably more worthy candidates. Colombia's James . Rodriguez, Germany's Muller and Manuel Neuer, Argentina's Javier Mascherano and Holland's Robben all had cases to make. It mattered little in the end, though, as Messi failed to inspire Argentina to a win that would have cemented his place in history.

"Germany and Argentina will do battle for the biggest prize in world football at the Maracana, but one man has already achieved victory at the World Cup. Heine Allemagne, 43, the man man who invented the magic vanishing spray adopted for use in Brazil, us set to reap the financial rewards after years in poverty and facing bankruptcy. The foam has proved a huge success in stopping defenders from encroaching on the 10-yard gap on free-kicks, and disappears in 60 seconds.

Thin white line Vanishing spray to mark out free-kicks has been used at the World Cup . Heine told the Mirror that seeing the spray being . used for the first time at the World Cup was a 'magical moment' and . added: 'I dedicated 14 years of my life to this idea.

Allemagne . grew up as one of five children living in a crowded three-bedroom house . in Ituiutaba, a small town between Sao Paulo and Brasilia. In the air: The Premier League is expected to discuss with clubs whether to use it . In action: The spray stops defensive walls from encroaching too far forward . 'We . all slept together in one small room. I never had any toys and we had . few clothes. My parents sent me out to work at the age of eight.' he . said. But now, Allemagne acknowledges he is set to make a lot of money if his product is adopted globally. 'I . hope that whatever financial gain is comparable to my 14 years of . struggle. I’ve paid a high price. I chose not to see my children grow up . so that I could make this work.'

"Bastian Schweinsteiger is targeting further glory with Germany after finally winning his first major trophy with the national side. Ever since he made his international debut in 2004, Schweinsteiger had become used to just coming up short in major tournaments. Of the five he played in prior to Brazil, Schweinsteiger reached the semi-finals on three occasions and at Euro 2008 he was part of the Germany team that lost to Spain. Mind the drop: Schweinsteiger sits with the World Cup trophy outside Germany's team hotel on Monday . Moment to savour: The midfielder leads the celebrations with the Germany fans in the Maracana . All that changed on Sunday night, though, when he and his team-mates beat Argentina 1-0 to win the World Cup in the Maracana. Schweinsteiger does not want this to be the last time he lifts a trophy, however. With a young squad in place, he feels there is plenty of potential there for Germany to go on and win many trophies in the near future. 'This will give us hunger now, absolutely,' the midfielder said. 'We want to do it again at the next tournament. The important thing is that the young guys have the experience of this tournament and we will go to France (for Euro 2016) and try and do it again for sure. The world's greatest: Schweinsteiger commiserates Argentina's Lionel Messi after the final . 'It won't be easy because we have a young team. But we have some players like Philipp Lahm, Mesut Ozil and Per Mertesacker who have the experience. This mix makes a big difference.' No European nation had previously lifted the famous trophy on South American soil in four attempts. So Schweinsteiger was understandably proud of his team-mates for writing history in Rio. 'We are the first European team to win the title in South America, the first team from Europe so it has been special,' the 29-year-old added.

Argentina head into Sunday's final against Germany in Rio de Janeiro as underdogs after Joachim Low's side demolished Brazil 7-1 in the semi-final in Belo Horizonte. But Mourinho thinks there will be little to separate the two teams at the Maracana, and things the midfield battle could be key to deciding the winner. He said: 'In midfield, where Germany is very very strong because they have Schweinsteiger, Khedira and Kroos plus an important fact which is the fact  that Ozil drops back, Muller drops back and they put many many times four or five players in a central area.

'On the other side, its where Argentina is also very solid, with the outstanding Mascherano with the tactical discipline of Luca Biglia with fantastic effort, running and pressing and covering spaces from people like Enzo Perez and Lavezzi closing the sides.

Champions: Germany won their fourth World Cup after beating Argentina 1-0 in the final at the Maracana . We wanted attacking football and we got it. A total of 171 goals in 64 games, in fact. But who would have thought the two real pastings of the tournament would see world champions Spain let in five and Brazil hit for seven? Unbelievable. It was as though everyone got together before the tournament and decided to go for it. Just a shame no-one told England. Goals galore: Germany put seven past hosts Brazil in the semi-final in Belo Horizonte . Rout: Holland thrashed Spain 5-1 in their Group B opener that was a rematch of the 2010 final . The goals, oh the goals. Was the volley from James Rodriguez better than Tim Cahill’s? Was Jermaine Jones’s long-range effort for the USA better than David Luiz’s freekick? How about the execution of Robin van Persie’s header again Spain, or could you even make a late argument for Mario Gotze’s dramatic World Cup winner considering the circumstances? Who cares, let’s just celebrate them all. Technique: James Rodriguez's wonder strike against Uruguay was one of the best goals of the tournament . Strike: Tim Cahill scores a volley for Australia against Holland in Porto Alegre . The underdogs had their day and didn’t we just love it? Hands up who had Costa Rica down to finish top of a group that included three former winners in England, Italy and Uruguay. Germany needed extra-time and all of Manuel Neuer’s brilliance to see off Algeria, Australia went toe-to-toe with Holland, so too Chile with just about anyone put in their way, and Iran almost beat Argentina before Lionel Messi’s injury-time winner. Yes, Germany won, but it has been the most unpredictable tournament of them all. Fairytale: Costa Rica finished top of Group D and made it all the way to the quarter-finals . David Luiz -  Did any player capture the rollercoaster emotions of this World Cup better than the erratic Brazil defender? Whether he was belting out the national anthem, belting the ball into the Colombians’ net before embarking on the tournament’s most manic celebration or weeping at his country’s capitulation, we lived it with him. Coco the Clown or the world’s most expensive defender? Both turned up in Brazil and it made for compelling viewing.

Louis van Gaal's game of penalty poker. We were already looking forward to seeing the ‘Iron Tulip’ in the Premier League next season before Van Gaal took the bizarre gamble to substitute goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen with ‘penalty specialist’ Tim Krul in the 120th minute of Holland’s quarter-final against Costa Rica. The bluff worked as Krul (two saves from 20 penalties faced at Newcastle) won the shootout for the Dutch. Madness or sheer genius? Doesn’t matter. More please, Louis.

Brazil 1-7 Germany. It was sensational, it was jaw-dropping and at times it was almost too painful to watch. Has there been another result quite like it in the history of the game? Brazil, in the semi-finals of their own World Cup, letting in seven? Sometimes football has the capacity to transcend sport, to bring us a ‘where were you when’ moment, and this was one of them. Brazil won’t appreciate it, but it has helped make their World Cup simply unforgettable. Demolition: Germany produced one of the most shocking results in World Cup history by beating Brazil 7-1 . Spain didn’t win again. Admit it, we were all getting a bit fed up of tiki-taka and seeing Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Co taking the proverbial out of a succession of opponents who just couldn’t get the ball. After one World Cup success and two more in the European Championship, enough was enough. Has Brazil ’14 signalled the end of Spanish dominance? Who cares, we just needed a break. End of the road: Spain's recent dominance of international football came to an end in Brazil . The celebrations. We know, every World Cup has them. But this was a particularly vintage year. Some will prefer the choreographed routines of Colombia and Ghana to the spontaneous outpouring of joy typified by David Luiz’s Tardelli-esque charge to the touchline, the stunned disbelief of John Brooks after he headed a late winner for the USA or Van Persie and Van Gaal also failing to connect with their High Five on the touchline, but we loved them all. Hero: John Brooks looks on in disbelief after his late winner for USA against Ghana in Natal . Brazil were the hosts. Would it have been the same if Adrian Chiles, Martin O’Neill, Ian Wright and his ‘gaffer’ Glenn Hoddle had come to us from a studio set up on Blackpool Sands? Would we be cooing at the sight of the Angel of the North looming over the World Cup final? Exactly.

"Brazilians already downhearted at missing out on reaching the World Cup final watched in dismay last night as their national team lost to the Netherlands 3-0 in the third-place match.

On Copacabana Beach, university . student Luiz de Almeira shook his head in dismay each time Brazil seemed . like it would score but missed opportunities. ‘I'm proud of being Brazilian but I'm mad because we could have been making history,’ the 20-year-old business student said. ‘The team has not shown what it is . capable of doing and the only salvation is that Brazil has managed to . show it could pull off a good World Cup.’ Nathalia Gomes, an 18-year-old high . school student, said she hoped Brazil's World Cup would be remembered . more for the people's hospitality than for the national team's losses, . especially Brazil's 7-1 thrashing by Germany. ‘This World Cup should go down in . history for the friendliness of the fans, for the party we through and . not for the 7-1 defeat,’ said Ms Gomes, who watched the game from . Alzirao. Artur Jose, a 33-year-old . administrative assistant, said Brazil's team for the 2014 tournament . will be remembered as its worst ever. Upset: A fan of Brazil reacts as she watches as the Netherlands score a second goal against Brazil at the FIFA Fan Fest in Sao Paulo . Looking up: Fans of Brazil watch a live broadcast of the World Cup third-place match on Copacabana beach, Rio de Janeiro . Varying emotions: A performer dressed in an Amazonian Indian costume holds an Argentine flag outside the FIFA Fan Fest area on Copacabana Beach . ‘We didn't have any sort of strategy, . no cohesion, no game and only one good player,’ he said, referring to . Neymar, who was knocked out of the competition with an injury. ‘The one good thing that might come . out of this humiliation would be if people remember this feeling at the . ballot boxes during the elections’ in October to select a new president. ‘Brazil is going through hard times: On the pitch and off,’ he said. While many Brazilians objected to the billions spent to put on the World Cup, few protests materialized during the event. But 66-year-old Magali Garcia Linares . said the team's terrible performance reinforced her opposition to big . spending by Brazil for international sporting events.

The invisible things, things that really matter, were left . undone.’ Louis van Gaal will arrive in . Manchester this week as a winner after heaping more misery on Brazil’s . wretched World Cup campaign. Van Gaal is set to be unveiled at Old . Trafford on Thursday with his reputation enhanced from a rewarding month . in South America that saw Holland qualify from the Group of Death and . last night complete an impressive third-place finish. For Brazil, while they weren’t . thrashed quite as badly as they had been against Germany in Tuesday . night’s historic semi-final, a second successive heavy defeat on home . soil was a devastating end to a campaign which promised so much. Manager Felipe Scolari, a World Cup winner in 2002, surely won’t be able to survive this. He’s been accused by 200 million . people of picking the wrong players and choosing the wrong tactics. On . last night’s evidence in Brasilia, they aren’t all be wrong. Holland carried on where Germany left . off with two goals in the opening 17 minutes – both the result of . blunders from Brazilian centre-backs Thiago Silva and David Luiz. Clinical: Holland defender Daley Blind lashes the ball into the net for second goal against Brazil . All together now: Daley Blind (second left) celebrates scoring Holland's second goal against Brazil . The South Americans huffed and puffed . after that without ever suggesting they had the quality to launch a . fightback and Georgino Wijnaldum completed the humiliation in . injury-time. Scolari made six changes from the team humiliated by Germany for a third-place play-off which for once carried some meaning. Van Gaal stuck with his big guns Arjen . Robben and Robin van Persie though Wesley Sneijder didn’t last beyond . the warm-up after tweaking a hamstring and had to be replaced by . Jonathan de Guzman of Swansea City. After three minutes of the game last . night, Silva, who missed the semi-final debacle through suspension, . wasn’t strong enough to stop van Persie from turning midway in the . Brazilian half and releasing Robben. As the Bayern forward sped towards the . penalty area, Silva gave a despairing tug at the back of his shirt. The . connection probably happened just outside the penalty area but Robben . fell inside, and referee Djamel Halmoudi awarded a penalty that van . Persie converted high and hard. The only consolation for Brazil was . that Silva escaped with just a yellow card when he’d clearly denied . Robben a goalscoring opportunity. By 17 minutes, Brazil had conceded again leading to fears of another humiliating drubbing. Luiz was again the fall-guy, heading a . clearance straight to Daley Blind who had time to take two touches to . control the ball with his left foot and then dispatch a finish with his . right into the roof of the net past Julio Cesar. Blow: Holland defender Daley Blind was injured in challenge on Brazil's Oscar (left) Agony: Injured defender Daley Blind is carried off on a stretcher . Brazil looked shellshocked but while . Germany were hungry for more goals on Tuesday night, the Dutch were . happy to sit back until they got opportunities to hit the hosts on the . counter-attack. Oscar started to see more of the ball . and was unlucky that his whipped-in free-kick didn’t get a decisive . touch off Chelsea team-mate Willian or Jo. One solo run and shot by Oscar was saved by Jasper Cillessen – Brazil’s only effort on target in the entire first half. Even in low gear, Holland seemed more . likely to score. Van Persie had a low shot saved by Julio Cesar and when . the Dutch broke, they met little resistance from a woeful Brazilian . midfield. Scolari, whose job looks certain end . sooner rather than later, made a change at the interval with Manchester . City’s Fernandinho replacing Luis Gustavo. Gustavo’s only contribution of the . opening 45 minutes had been to leave Dirk Kuyt with a nasty gash on the . back of his head with a wayward arm. But it didn’t improve much for Brazil . after half-time. The harder poor Luiz tried, the worse it got for him as . he gave the ball away with regularity. The scorer of an incredible free-kick . against Colombia couldn’t beat Cillessen with a relatively tame effort . when given a shooting chance from 25 yards. Jose Mourinho must be thinking he’s a genius for selling the shaggy-haired defender for £40million before the World Cup. Clincher: Holland midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum seals victory with injury-time strike . Down and out: Georginio Wijnaldum scored the 10th goal against Brazil in two games - a new low . Nightmare: Injured Neymar couldn't bear to watch as Brazil went down to Holland . His former Chelsea team-mate Oscar . didn’t fare much better. He was booked for diving when he ran into Blind . and then somersaulted in the air looking for a penalty.  Poor Blind had . to be carried off with a hurt knee as a result of the coming-together . and Daryl Janmaat replaced him for the last 20 minutes. By the time Scolari introduced Hulk for the latter stages, you knew he and the entire nation were desperate. It was no surprise when the muscular . forward got himself into a good shooting position and then took a wild . swipe at the ball to send it wide. Van Gaal was angry that Robben – who admitted diving earlier in the tournament – had two decent penalty appeals turned down. But ultimately, it didn’t matter. In . fact, Janmaat crossed for Wijaldum to make it 3-0 and van Gaal was able . to send on third-choice goalkeeper Michel Vorm to ensure all 23 of his . players in Brazil had tasted some action - a nice touch. The contrast between the relaxed way . Holland’s players found space and knocked the ball around compared to . the hypertension in Brazil’s game was evident. If van Gaal can replicate it at Old Trafford, the fallen champions will be more than happy.","Brazilian crowd in silence as Netherlands knock in one goal after another .

"Louis van Gaal created the little bit of history that he desired by ensuring Holland remained undefeated in normal and extra time with a 3-0 third-place play-off victory over hosts Brazil. A penalty from Robin van Persie after just three minutes, a Daley Blind strike and a Georginio Wijnaldum goal in injury time ensured a comfortable win for Van Gaal's men in Brasilia. Here, Sportsmail rates all of the players involved in the match. Success: Louis van Gaal's Holland side triumphed 3-0 over Brazil in the third-place play-off . Clincial: Robin van Persie put Holland ahead after just three minutes with an excellent penalty kick .

Bewildered: Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has seen his side concede ten goals in just two matches . Laughter: Neymar (left) was injured and unable to play but he still took his place on the Brazil bench . BRAZIL . JULIO CESAR - 6 . Poor for the last goal but helpless for the first two. MAICON - 6 . Look likes a player who is treading water regularly but did okay at times. DAVID LUIZ - 5 . Poor for the second goal but was not anyway as awful as he was against Germany. Poor: David Luiz (left) and Paulinho (right) struggled to deal with Arjen Robben's pace throughout . THIAGO SILVA - 6 . Totally out-paced by Arjen Robben after just two minutes for the penalty but he does make a difference to this Brazil side. MAXWELL - 6 . Ran his heart out for Brazil but this is just not a classy Samba side we expect. LUIS GUSTAVO - 5 . Usually controls the midfield for Brazil but his form has deserted him in the last couple of matches. Anger: Brazil captain Thiago Silva (left) appeals after giving away a second-minute penalty . RAMIRES - 6 . He will run around for you as much as you like but he is also prone to committing a foul - and he made a couple of bad ones in this match. PAULINHO - 5 . Could not get himself into the match and had very little impact. OSCAR - 7 . Extremely unfortunate to be booked for diving when clearly clipped in the box and Brazil's most creative player. Hacked: Oscar (left) was fouled by Ron Vlaar (right) in the box but the Brazilian midfielder was booked for diving . Booking: Oscar (centre on ground) was yellow carded for simulation during the second half in Brasilia . WILLIAN - 6 .

Terrible: An awful week for Scolari got even worse as his side conceded 10 goals in just two matches . HOLLAND . JASPER CILLESSEN - 7 . Didn't have too much to do but when he did he was commanding.

"Brazil's third-place play-off against Holland on Saturday was a chance for a redemption following their jaw-dropping 7-1 humiliation to Germany in the World Cup semi-finals. However, in Brasilia the horror show continued as they were comprehensively swept aside 3-0 by a far superior Dutch team.

Correio na Copa leads with the damning headline 'Ridiculous' following the loss to Louis van Gaal's side. The paper continues with: 'After humilation against Germany, the Selecao suffers a blackout in the third place play-off and says goodbye to the tournament in a melancholy way.' The hosts were much fancied to win a record sixth World Cup, especially following their Confederations Cup success last year, but arguably have regressed since their 3-0 victory against Spain in that final. Ridiculous: The front page of Correio na Copa states that Brazil exited the World Cup in a melancholy way . Correio's summarisation is an accurate reflection amongst the Brazilian papers as Agora Sao Paulo headlines with 'Knockout!' Alongside that a picture of David Luiz accompanies the front of the newspaper - as the defender again had a torrid time at the heart of the World Cup hosts defence.

"Long-standing issues throughout the Brazilian game have led to disappointment in their home World Cup, according to Gilberto Silva. The 2002 World Cup winner believes the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) needs to work closer with the government, club sides and ex-professionals to improve football at every level in the country. Having won the right to host the 2014 tournament - despite their bid leading to mass protests due to the amount of money required to stage the World Cup - Brazil could not deliver the trophy and were humiliated in the semi-finals as they crashed out following a 7-1 thrashing at the hands of Germany. Better times: Gilberto (right) was part of the 2002 World Cup winning squad in Japan and South Korea . Nightmare: Injured Neymar couldn't bear to watch as Brazil went down to Holland . Holland then inflicted more pain as they beat the hosts to win the third-place play-off 3-0 and Gilberto reckons the problems are much deeper than the current crop of internationals simply not measuring up to their predecessors. 'It is hard to say where things went wrong,' he told BBC Radio 5Live's Sportsweek. 'It is not all about the national team - it is about what is happening in Brazilian football. 'They way people administrate football and run football in this country, they must work better on coaching schools and academies. 'There is something also with the country's problems - at some point that is nothing to do with football but at times they come together. 'Everyone expected us to win as a solution for the problems in our country but I hope people pay attention and try to work better to find a solution, that is what I want.' Devastation: A tearful David Luiz is comforted by Thiago Silva after the Germany result that shook Brazil . Deep-rooted: Brazil's media blamed Luiz Felipe Scolari's team but Gilberto thinks the problems are bigger . Tackling the problem: Gilberto blamed footballing administrators and says he predicted the failure months ago . The former Arsenal midfielder revealed he had teamed up with a number of former internationals to raise concerns about the running of the Brazilian game 12 months ago - but their approach fell on deaf ears. 'There are group of players who have good sense, I'm involved with them and we are trying for better solutions on the football side and I hope from now on that people pay attention to what we are asking for,' he said. 'A group of players, we have good sense, we asked for months - we spoke to CBF and the government to speak about the situation and the football. Dream start: Van Persie scores from the spot against Brazilian goalkeeper Julio Cesar in the third minute . Down and out: Georginio Wijnaldum scored the 10th goal against Brazil in two games - a new low . 'Now people are starting to pay attention about what we asked, sometimes they don't pay wages for the players and are not very good at administration there are a lot of problems and they cant solve that. 'At some point the crack comes and today isn't the factor for what has happened now in the World Cup it has come from the last 10 years.

"Lionel Messi seems to be getting a bit carried away in training ahead of the most important match of his life. The Argentina superstar would have been forgiven for taking it easy before Sunday's World Cup final against Germany as his country need him on top form. But, instead, the 27-year-old executed an overhead kick as the Argentina stars played a game of foot volley. Steady on: Lionel Messi (centre) does a bicycle kick at training ahead of the World Cup final . Argentina will be encouraged that Messi is looking so energetic after claims from the superstar's father that the forward has been struggling at the World Cup because he is exhausted. Messi has covered less distance on the pitch than any outfield player who has played six games at this World Cup, apart from Brazil striker Fred. And Messi's father Jorge told Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo: 'Leo said it looked like his legs weighed 100 kilos (against Holland). He was very tired.' Earlier in the tournament, Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher suggested that Messi's lack of running could be in order to protect his suspect hamstring, which caused him to miss a lot of the season with Barcelona. Inaction man: Messi is exhausted, says his father and he has not run a great deal as the table below shows . Least distance covered in World Cup (of players who have featured in six games): . Fred - 47.2km . Lionel Messi - 51.9km . Georginio Wijnaldum - 53.9km . But Carragher also believes Messi is changing his game and becoming more of an old-fashioned playmaker, writing after the last-16 match against Switzerland: 'He doesn’t seem to be running as much, he is waiting for the ball. 'His running stats were the lowest on the pitch against Switzerland, which is evidence of the change in his game - but he caused maximum trouble and won the match for Argentina. 'The more I study his performances, the more I believe he’s in control and waiting for that moment to arrive when he can make a difference.'","Messi does overhead kick as Argentina train before World Cup final .

"When it comes to the World Cup, there is always the temptation to forget that England were ever at the tournament in the first place. After all that’s what the FA, the guardians of the national sport, did after Costa Rica beat Italy on June 20. To put England’s embarrassing performance into context, 12 teams - Argentina, Bosnia Herzegovina, Nigeria, Iran, Germany, Portugal, Ghana, USA, Belgium, Russia, South Korea and Algeria - had not even played their second match when England were eliminated. Were you really here? Roy Hodgson (second left) and England players after the 0-0 draw against Costa Rica . England missed a trick when the kit skips were loaded on to a plane at the airport in Belo Horizonte after their final group game against Costa Rica ended with a 0-0 draw. It is then that the World Cup began elsewhere, opening up as Brazil, Germany, Holland and Argentina went deep into this tournament. Their arrival in the latter stages was no accident. All four of those teams, regardless of the outcome of the two semi-finals in Belo Horizonte and Sao Paulo, have the mentality of champions. They arrived in Brazil expecting to win it. Being around these teams is an experience, an education into the attitude and psychological determination these teams have on reaching the latter stages of a World Cup. Ask most Brazilians about their five World Cup wins and most of them will answer ‘Yes, but why didn’t we win the other 14?’. Germany have won three and lost four finals, Holland were beaten in the 2010 final by Spain and Argentina won it in 1978 and again in 1986. They know what it takes. England, as ever, were nowhere. To watch and learn from these teams is an exercise in itself, something which England and the FA could and should have picked up on. Instead they are monitoring the games from afar. In between Holland’s 2-1 victory over Mexico and their semi-final with Argentina in Sao Paulo, Louis van Gaal twice threw open the doors to Holland’s training centre. It was there, on a beautiful pitch at Flamengo’s practice ground in the shadows of Sugar Loaf mountain and Corcovado, that the next manager of Manchester United was at work. Learn from the master: Louis van Gaal (centre) is one of the best coaches at this World Cup . Listen up: The Holland players gather round to hear what Van Gaal has to say during training before their World Cup semi-final against Argentina . VIDEO Team Profile: Netherlands highlights . Those two sessions were both open to the public, which meant that any man Jack from the street could have walked in to watch Van Gaal at work. He is certainly an impressive figure. This is one of the world’s leading football bosses, the most flexible and daring coach at the tournament after his decision to throw on a substitute keeper for a penalty shoot-out against Cost Rica. Even the loveable Dutch scout Piet de Visser, a 79-year-old man who has been around the block a few times, was sat on the concrete terraces watching Van Gaal at work. It’s what people who want to learn do with their days. To argue that Van Gaal, who won league titles with Ajax, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and AZ Alkmaar, plus the Champions League win in 1995, is somehow ahead of his time would be wrong. But let’s also not forget that this is a guy who has coached some of the world’s leading footballers during his career. There is certainly an aura about him. Low aiming high: Germany coach Joachim Low wants to win the nation's fourth World Cup . Whenever he blew his whistle during those sessions - which was rare - his players automatically crowded around him to listen intently to his observations. He is the ring-master. Off the field, there is a different mentality. The FA’s communications team provides key notes for the players to memorise before they speak with the media. Contrast that with the attitude of the Dutch, who organised a press conference with Tim Krul and Jasper Cillessen after Van Gaal’s ballsy substitution in the 119th minute in the quarter-final against Costa Rica. It is unthinkable that England would have done the same. At that same training sessions former Holland striker Pierre van Hooijdonk, an analyst with Dutch television, was soaking up some of van Gaal’s experience. He, like everyone else present, wanted to learn.

It is what the nation demands, as several players - Philipp Lahm, Andre Schurrle and particularly Per Mertesacker - have referenced at various stages of this tournament. ‘We are not a Mickey Mouse team,’ was Mertesacker’s response to questions about the team’s performance against Algeria in Porto Alegre in the second round. They are a tournament team. It is incredible to think that England have become obsessed with technique. In doing so, they have lost something else from their game.

"Bite defence: Luis Suarez has said he lost his balance and fell into Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup . Luis Suarez has denied 'biting' Italian defendeer Giorgio Chielli, suggesting he lost his balance and fell onto him. He told FIFA's disciplinary panel that he did not deliberately sink his teeth into the player, and that he was the person who was left in the most pain. 'In no way it happened how you have described, as a bite or intent to bite,' the Uruguay striker wrote in Spanish in a letter dated June 25. He aqdded: 'After the impact ... I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling on top of my opponent.' The player's defense is in paragraph 6 of FIFA's disciplinary committee ruling. Suarez wrote in his submission to the panel which met Wednesday, one day after Uruguay beat Italy 1-0 in a decisive group-stage match. 'At that moment I hit my face against the player leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth,' Suarez said. However, the seven-man panel which met on Wednesday evening dismissed the argument. The bite was 'deliberate, intentional and without provocation,' the ruling stated in paragraph No. 26 of the panel's conclusions. Suarez was banned for nine Uruguay matches and four months from all football. He was also fined 100,000 Swiss francs ($112,000). The panel, chaired by former Switzerland international Claudio Sulser, included members from the Cook Islands, Hong Kong, Pakistan, Panama, South Africa and Singapore. The ruling confirmed that referee Marco Rodriguez of Mexico acknowledged in his match report that he missed Suarez's bite. So did his two assistants and the fourth official. 'I haven't seen the incident because the ball was in another sector of the pitch,' Rodriguez writes in paragraph No. 4 of witness submissions in the 11-page document. A FIFA spokesperson said that they had received a formal 'intention to appeal' from the AUF on Friday night and that the Uruguayans now have a further seven days to submit their written reasons for the appeal. Suarez was banned on Thursday for Uruguay's next nine competitive international matches and from any involvement in football for four months after biting defender Giorgio Chiellini in their 1-0 Group D win over Italy. When he returned home to Montevideo, he was pictured holding his children and greeting fans from his balcony .

That is four kilos. ‘They have to replenish otherwise they will start hallucinating. The players know this.

"Landon Donovan has criticised coach Jurgen Klinsmann's tactics during USA's World Cup campaign, which ended with a 2-1 defeat by Belgium in the last 16. Klinsmann stunned the nation when he decided to leave the 32-year-old Donovan, USA's record scorer, out of his 23-man squad for the tournament. While Donovan has been careful with his words in his television appearances during the tournament, the team's exit prompted a pointed critique of the German coach's approach. VIDEO Scroll down to Watch Landon Donovan reacting to Chris Wondolowki's miss . Hit out: Jurgen Klinsmann's tactics at the World Cup were criticised by Landon Donovan . Left behind: Donovan was omitted by Klinsmann from USA' 23-man squad for the World Cup . 'I think the most disappointing is we didn't seem like we gave it a real effort, from a tactical standpoint,' he told mlssoccer.com. 'I thought the guys did everything they could, they did everything that was asked of them, but I don't think (tactically) we were set up to succeed... and that was tough to watch.' Donovan said Klinsmann had turned away from the positive approach he had adopted since taking over the US team in 2011. Agony: USA's run at the World Cup ended when they were beaten 2-1 by Belgium in the last 16 . 'They were set up in a way that was opposite from what they've been the past couple of years, which is opening up, passing, attacking - trying to do that. And the team has been successful that way. 'Why they decided to switch that in the World Cup, none of us will know. From a playing standpoint, I think the guys will probably be disappointed in the way things went,' he said. After striker Jozy Altidore was injured in their opening win against Ghana, Klinsmann opted to play Clint Dempsey as a lone striker and Donovan said that was a negative approach. Backwards: Donovan thinks it was negative to play Clint Dempsey as a lone striker after Jozy Altidore's injury . Up in the air: Donovan is unsure whether he will return to the USA national team . 'My feeling as a player, if I'm in that locker room before that game - before the Germany game, before the Belgium game - and the coach walked in and said we're playing a 4-5-1 and Clint is up top by himself, I would have been disappointed. Because I would have said let's go for it. I want a chance to go for it and try to win the game,' he said. LA Galaxy forward Donovan also criticised the decision to play Michael Bradley in a more advanced role in midfield. Donovan evaded the question of whether he expected to return to the national team ahead of next year's North American Gold Cup. 'We'll see. That depends on a lot of conversations that would have to be held,' he said. On Wednesday, Klinsmann said he intended to turn towards young players in the coming year as he seeks out new talent for the national team.","Donovan says USA were 'not set up to succeed'

"Jose Pekerman has told his Colombia side to ignore the hype around Luis Suarez as they prepare for the biggest game in their history. The coach, who has brilliantly guided his free-scoring team into today’s last-16 clash, knows Suarez’s ban could be a distraction in the build-up. Pekerman said: ‘It is a very delicate issue. It seems to me that our concern is Uruguay and we are working hard to deal with them. Warning to his players: Colombian national coach Jose Pekerman says the team must stay focused . ‘Uruguay are highly respected. We knew the possibility of playing them, they are always top-notch. We have to be ready. ‘Playing them motivates us. We have huge respect for Uruguay’s history, we have to continue moving ahead.’ Colombia keeper David Ospina, who plays his club football in France with Nice, claims Uruguay can overcome the loss of Suarez. Ospina said: ‘All national teams have difficulties. We had difficulties, but that is why it is down to all members of the team to have the ability and skill to overcome any difficulty.’ Pekerman also claimed Uruguay are under pressure to win today’s match after coming through a difficult group with England, Italy and Costa Rica. Causing more controversy: Uruguay's Luis Suarez has gone home after being banned for four months . The Colombia coach said: ‘The big teams must prove why they are so big, why they have won things and why they are so valued. ‘In countries such as ours, which hasn’t competed at the World Cup for so long, we must show our willingness and ambitions. ‘We must know how to compete and we are doing quite well. ‘This is a huge test for us.

"At the end of his country’s disastrous Euro 2012 campaign in Ukraine, Arjen Robben hinted at familiar problems that seem to have been around Dutch football almost as long as their famous orange shirts. ‘If you want to accomplish something together, you have to put egos aside,’ said the Holland winger. ‘You have to fight as a team to regain that sense of invincibility. It won’t come by itself.’ Holland lost all three group games two years ago. After having been World Cup finalists two years previously, Bert van Marwijk’s team fell apart quickly and the common conception was that familiar failings had done for them again. Leaders: Robben and van Persie have taken on the roles of responsibility in the Dutch setup under van Gaal . Flying Dutchman: van Persie, who scored brilliantly against Spain, has flourished in Brazil so far . Here in Brazil, they will tell you it is different. They will tell you that Louis van Gaal’s squad finally understand the value of unity and that Robben has played an integral part — along with Robin van Persie. Van Persie, who will return to the side after suspension for tomorrow’s last 16 tie against Mexico, is Van Gaal’s captain while Robben is the understudy. A decision made by Van Gaal on taking the job, it says something that the two men he stood down, Wesley Sneijder and Dirk Kuyt, remain integral and uncomplaining members of the squad. Anyone who saw Kuyt running himself into the ground at left back against Chile earlier this week will have noticed evidence of ongoing commitment. Relationship: Manager and captain are extremely close in the Holland camp, with each quick to praise the other . Man-management: van Gaal has also brought the best out of Robben as the two stars lead their team . At the more glamorous point of the team, Van Persie and Robben are writing their names all over this World Cup. Neither player has always been easy to handle. David Moyes struggled to hit the right note with the Manchester United striker while Robben was viewed as a shirker during his years with Chelsea. ‘Arjen Faint Heart’, was Jose Mourinho’s sobriquet for him. If Holland are to progress deeper into this tournament, though, it is clear that both players will be very influential. Those who follow the team closely say the responsibility of leadership has brought the best out of them. Van . Persie’s bond with Van Gaal is clear, illustrated perfectly by the . rather clumsy but genuine high five the two men exchanged after the . United striker’s diving header against Spain two weeks ago. ‘If we do well here it will be because of the coach,’ said Van Persie. Robben, meanwhile, is said to have . matured somewhat since his days in England. He has married his long-term . girlfriend, is an ambassador for his first club, Groningen, and is . involved in a project to encourage young Dutch children to read more. Meaningful: It may have been slightly clumsy but this high five showed the unity in the Dutch camp . Wonder-strike: Robben has been excellent in the group stages, including scoring this solo goal . But then maybe the reason for Van Gaal’s successful nurturing of his two best players is more simple. Van Persie and Robben both have egos to match their abundant gifts. They have long seen themselves as the two most important figures in the Dutch squad so what better way to channel that positively than by handing them the responsibilities of leadership? Willing: Dirk Kuyt has shown himself more than happy to be part of the team despite losing the vice-captaincy . This is a Dutch squad that is gifted but also flawed. Holland look vulnerable through the middle of their defence. Australia gave them a scare in their second group game and against Spain in game one they could have been two or three down before turning the game spectacularly on its head. In the centre of midfield, Nigel de Jong can appear one-paced and has looked like a walking red card at times. So Holland need to function fully up front if they are to prosper. Van Gaal seems to have got the balance right so far.","Since Euro 2012 Holland's two big stars have been given responsibility .

He has been wearing a different colour variation of the boot since signing for Barcelona ahead of the 2013-14 season but he will now hope that he has struck gold with this latest innovative style, for which the inspiration is Neymar’s own childhood memories. Denis Dekovic, Nike Football Design Director, explains: ‘When we met with Neymar he told us that when he was 12 he used to spray paint his boots gold. Side view: Neymar will hope to add to his four-goal tally with his trophy-coloured Hypervenom boots . Detail: The Hypervenom boots are the same design that Neymar wore at the Confederations Cup - but gold . 'He said that he always wanted a pair of gold boots but that he couldn’t find them anywhere. So we took that insight and decided this summer would be the perfect moment to create this boot for him. ‘The biggest challenge was getting the gold tone perfect so it had the right spray-painted look. We worked closely with Neymar to get it as close to how he remembered the colour when he would apply it as a kid.

Les Bleus travelled to South America unwilling to look further than progressing from the group stages but following their early success they have their sights set on World Cup glory.

The 31-year-old right back, quoted in L'Equipe, added: 'As players, we aspire to go as far as possible, to win the trophy. 'The World Cup will be successful only if we go to the end. 'If we do not do it then it would be a failure. 'The goal has been refined over time - it is four matches to the title and we want to do it.'

'We wanted to go through to the next stage, we tried our best but unfortunately, it wasn't possible. We fought hard but we didn't get there.' Midfielder Joao Moutinho was the only player who offered any sort of insight when he complained about the heat in Manaus where Portugal drew with the United States. 'I was tired after 30 minutes, although I know that the conditions were the same for everyone, so it's not an excuse,"" he said. Grounds for complaint? Joao Moutinho defended Portugal's decision to train in the USA . Moutinho also addressed the vexed issue of why Portugal had gone to train in the United States for 10 days before the World Cup, instead of preparing in Brazil. 'The conditions there were very similar to Campinas (Portugal's training camp in Brazil),"" he said. 'People are asking questions about this now because things did not go well.' But there was no suggestion that anything else had gone wrong. 'We have an excellent team who can beat any opponent, and two years ago we came within a whisker of reaching the Euro 2012 final. We musn't now throw everything away and say that we are the worst.'","Portugal arrived back home after a dismal showing at the 2014 World Cup .

"If the third World Cup final between Argentina and Germany resembles the first, we are in for an entertaining evening on Sunday. If it is anything like the second final, four years later, we will be nodding off or turning over before the 9pm watershed. A crowd of 114,600 filled the Aztec Stadium in Mexico City in 1986 to see Diego Maradona conclude the winning of his own World Cup. Key men: Germany's Thomas Muller (left) and Argentina's Lionel Messi (right) will be crucial to their sides as they meet for the third time in a World Cup final on Sunday at the Maracana .

Challenge: Maradona (left) and Germany's Felix Magath (right) compete for the ball during 1986's final . Football’s devilish answer to Chucky had carried Argentina to the final with his Hand of God plus the Goal of the Century against England, in addition to his full repertoire of magic through the tournament. West Germany, under the management of Franz Beckenbauer, strove to man-mark Maradona out of the game and came within minutes of succeeding, even though Jose Luis Brown and Jorge Valdano put Argentina two up inside an hour. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Rudi Voller seemed to have forced extra-time with late goals but Maradona was to have the last word. Finally, he wriggled free of his captors and plied Jorge Burruchaga with an exquisite pass for the 84th-minute winner. It hadn’t been pretty but the tension was gripping and Argentina were champions for the second time in three World Cups. Maradona came back for more at Italia 90, only to become even more of a marked man. Kiss: Maradona accepts the World Cup from Mexico's President Miguel de La Madrid (left) in 1986 . Hacked down: Maradona (centre) is up-ended during the 1986 final as he was throughout both tournaments . Hand of God: Maradona (second right) controversially scores past England's Peter Shilton in the 1986 quarter-final . He was kicked from first game to last, starting in Cameroon’s shock victory in the opening fixture of Argentina’s defence. They battled angrily on to the final but at the expense of suspensions and injuries which decimated their team. Maradona, both ankles as swollen as the ball and with those veins bulging blue and red, was warned he risked being crippled for life if he took part. He insisted on playing but not even he could save Argentina after they were reduced to nine men with the wounding dismissals of Pedro Monzon and Gustavo Dezotti. Revenge: Lothar Matthaus (centre) holds the World Cup trophy aloft after beating Argentina 1-0 in 1990 final . Dirty: Maradona is hacked down during the 1990 final as he had been all throughout the tournament . Discipline: Maradona (third left) argues with the referee as Argentina have two players sent off in 1990 final . The Germans, who had scraped past Bobby Robson’s England in the semi, made painfully hard work of it. But the referee awarded a dubious 85th-minute penalty, converted by Andreas Brehme with familiar Teutonic precision. Not pretty? It was downright ugly. But Beckenbauer, in the dugout for a second consecutive final, made his personally-deserved history by becoming the only World Cup winner as player, captain and manager.

"Brazil star Neymar could not hold back the tears as he revealed he had come within a few inches of being paralysed. Neymar, giving his first press conference after being hospitalised with a fractured vertebrae in Brazil’s World Cup quarter-final win over Colombia, also said he disagreed with his agent for calling coach Luiz Felipe Scolari 'a repulsive and conceited old jerk'.

'Zuniga called me a few days later to apologise and to tell me that he did not intend to hurt me,' Neymar said. 'I accept his apology, but I cannot consider that a normal action. 'I cannot say whether it was intentional, but everyone knows it wasn’t normal. The way he came in, behind me, I couldn’t defend myself. 'I thank God for helping me, because if that blow had been a few inches lower I would have risked being paralysed.' Neymar added that he could not conceive what had gone wrong in Brazil’s 7-1 semi-final defeat by Germany. He said: 'What has happened is inexplicable. But even at 6-0, 7-0 down, they did not give up, they kept running, kept trying. 'I’m not ashamed to be Brazilian and I’m not ashamed to be part of this team. I am proud of every one of my team-mates.' Brazilian star Neymar (pictured) missed the semi-final and third place playoff due to injury, but the 22-year-old was the most talked about player on Facebook throughout the whole competition. The Barcelona striker's Facebook account gained more than 15 million new Likes since the World Cup began . Moment of impact: Neymar is sent to the floor after Zuniga makes contact with his back . He also distanced himself from his agent Wagner Ribeiro, who launched a bizarre Twitter outburst at Scolari. Ribeiro produced a sarcastic list of 'six requirements to be Brazilian coach' on his Twitter account including 'going to Chelsea and being sacked the following day' and 'being an old jerk, arrogant, repulsive, conceited and ridiculous'. Neymar said: 'Scolari should stay as coach. I do not agree with what my agent Ribeiro said. He doesn’t speak for me - only my father can speak on my behalf.' The player hopes Brazil’s arch rivals Argentina triumph over Germany in Sunday’s final as it means his Barcelona club-mates Lionel Messi and Javier Mascherano will be winners. 'I hope that in the final my friends Mascherano and Messi will win,' Neymar said before leaving the press conference in tears, and to applause.

Scolari is expected to be replaced when Brazil’s tournament comes to an end after the third-place play-off with Holland on Saturday, and former Corinthians coach Tite, who led the club to a Copa Libertadores-FIFA Club World Cup double, is the favourite to succeed him. Earlier, Brazil’s sports minister had called for an inquiry to find out the 'root causes of the disaster' after the 7-1 defeat. Aldo Rebelo, who had previously referred to the 1950 final defeat by Uruguay as 'national tragedy', told a news conference in Rio: It’s a terrible blemish for Brazilian football, because against Germany we have played 12 times and lost only four times. 'We must analyse the root causes of this disaster, learn the lessons and try to correct them so this doesn’t happen again so that Brazil can regain its status in world football.' Rebelo said the 1950 Brazil team were 'a constellation of stars' and 'much better than what we have today.' Tite is viewed as Scolari’s most likely replacement, with Sao Paulo coach Muricy Ramalho and former Brazil and Real Madrid manager Vanderlei Luxemburgo also in the running.","Brazil star struggles to hold back tears as he reveals how close he came to being paralysed by Juan Zuniga's challenge .

"A good World Cup performance can send the . scouts circling like vultures, and Ahmed Musa's double in Nigeria's 3-2 loss to Argentina can only do the same. The CSKA Moscow forward scored Nigeria's fastest-ever goal at a World Cup on four minutes, and became their first player to score twice in one game in the tournament. Here, Sportsmail takes a closer look at the largely unknown 21-year-old. Who is Ahmed Musa? The winger's double against Argentina made him the first Nigerian in World Cup to do so . On the up: Musa, just 21, is a rising star and showed he can handle the pressure in the World Cup . 2008-2010: Aminchi FA (0 apps, 0 gls) 2008-2009: JUTH (loan) (18, 4) 2009-2010: Kano Pillars (loan) (25, 18) 2010-2012: VVV-Venlo (37, 8) 2012-NOW: CSKA Moscow (65, 19) 2010-NOW: Nigeria (37, 6) What's his history? Musa remained off . the beaten track until Russian Premier League club CSKA Moscow swooped, but the forward put in his time to get there. An Aminchi Football Academy product, Musa's second professional year on loan at Kano Pillars, scoring 18 goals in 25 games, saw him come to life. In doing so, he set a record in the Nigeria Premier League. It pricked the ears of Eredivisie outfit VVV-Venlo, who signed Musa in 2010. He waited until he was 18 under FIFA rules, as did VVV, and it paid off. We could have been introduced to Musa in the 2010 World Cup, after Lars Lagerback called him up to the 30-man squad for South Africa, but an unfortunate ankle injury prevailed. An unnamed Bundesliga team bid £8million in 2011, which was turned down, before Moscow got their man for an undisclosed fee in 2012. Goal: Musa shoots to score his second goal against Argentina, bringing his tally to six for his country . Curler: Musa's first stole the show of the game, though, as he curled home a beauty from the left wing . CSKA MOSCOW: Russian Premier League (2012-13, 2013-14), Russian Cup (2012-13), Russian Super Cup (2013) NIGERIA: Africa Cup of Nations (2013), WAFU Nations Cup (2010) What's his goalscoring record like? Statistics don't lie, and neither do Musa's. Since moving to Moscow, the forward has performed admirably on the wing, scoring 19 in 65 in the Russian Premier League. He has bags of potential, particularly at such a young age, and showed he can bring that to the world stage against Argentina. His brace in the Group F finale brought his total for Nigeria to six in 37 games, and Musa could have had his hat-trick had it not been for heroic defending from Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta, who was given a run for his money by his pacey counterpart. Has he adapted well to new countries? From Nigeria, to Holland, then Russia - and even Brazil - Musa has taken to each well. It would be unfair to compare the Eredivisie and Russian Premier League to that in England, but there seem to be no causes for concern should Musa attract interest from the likes of Tottenham Hotspur, as he did in 2011, or others. Musa has spent two years in Russia, winning the title twice, and seems comfortable. Opponent: Musa gave Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta a run for his money in Argentina's 3-2 win . Has . he attracted interested? For a largely unknown player, Musa has been on many a shortlist. Most notably in England is that of Tottenham Hotspur who, during his VVV days, were reported to have sent scouts to Holland. There have also been Eredivisie giants Ajax on the hunt and the anonymous Bundesliga club whose £8m could not tempt him to Germany. Is it time he tested his mettle in the English Premier League? It is known to be the most demanding - and rewarding - league in the world, so no wonder most players aim for England. Musa would surely fit in, given the two impressive goals he bagged against Argentina to become the first Nigerian to ever bag a brace in a World Cup match. There, he more than held his own against an array of stars, including Marcos Rojo, Ezeuiel Garay and Javier Mascherano to name a few. He would, though, have to up his . physical game. Musa, for all his technical ability when it comes to . scoring, hardly looks strong enough in his five foot seven frame to . battle in the Premier League. That, though, is something that can easily . be worked on. Celebrate: Musa could be Premier League bound after showing his talent in the World Cup for Nigeria . Who could be interested? As we know, Tottenham already showed an interest but didn't make their move in 2011. Unfortunately for those at White Hart Lane, putting in such an impressive World Cup performance can only see Musa's stock go up. Everton may not be too disinterested in giving the forward his chance in the Premier League, particularly given they lost Gerard Deulofeu to Barcelona after his loan spell last season. There is also Sunderland, who may have something to say about Musa's future. On his way? The likes of Tottenham, Everton and Sunderland may be intrigued by the pacey player .","Ahmed Musa equalised twice against Argentina as Nigeria lost 3-2 .

"Glenn Hoddle says he's not surprised by Brazil's utter capitulation in Tuesday's humiliating 7-1 World Cup semi-final defeat to Germany. The former England international has commented on the host nations defensive frailties in the past, which Joachim Low's side fully exposed in Belo Horizonte. Brazil's drubbing was the largest ever scoreline in a World Cup semi-final and the 56-year-old believes only Thiago Silva, who missed the game through suspension, is the only capable defender for the host nation.

Nightmare: Silva (right) tries to comfort defensive partner David Luiz who played poorly against Germany . 'For me it was no surprise that Brazil fell apart defensively last night, because from before the tournament started I made the point that Brazil cannot defend. Only the margin of the defeat was a surprise,' he wrote in his William Hill column. 'Three out of their four defenders cannot defend - only Thiago Silva resembled a defender - and with him suspended, I don’t think I have ever witnessed a back line with all four ‘defenders’ unable to defend.' Hoddle added that the loss of talisman Neymar wouldn't have affected the outcome of the match too differently had he been fit. The 22-year-old suffered a fractured vertebra during Brazil's 2-1 quarter-final win against Colombia on Friday but Hoddle, who has played for and managed England at previous World Cups, believes the forward's talents would have proved ineffective against the efficient German machine. 'Neymar was a great loss, of course, but not even someone so talented could have done much to help out a non-existent defence, and it was only a matter of time before he couldn’t carry an entire team on his own,' he added. 'Neymar was nowhere near as effective in his last two games and might not have made much of a difference in any case against the Germans. 'The bottom line has been that Brazil sent out an entire back four - all of whom wanted to play on the ball.'

"Ultimately, he couldn’t see the job through to the end. Louis van Gaal’s dreams of heading to the Barclays Premier League with the ultimate stamp on his CV were dashed by the trauma of a penalty shoot-out at Arena Corinthians on Wednesday night. At Old Trafford, they will perhaps not rue Holland’s exit too much as they prepare for the arrival of a coach who must get things right quickly if the damage of the David Moyes months is to be undone over the course of the new season. Van Gaal’s . schedule looks rather daunting. After a third-place play-off game . against Brazil on Saturday, Van Gaal will fly back to Holland with his . squad before heading to Manchester on Tuesday where his wife Truus has . already found a house in Cheshire. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Giggs and Fletcher excited about new regime at United . Fiery: Louis van Gaal on the touchline during the semi-final defeat . Dejected: Van Gaal can't hide his disappointment after Holland are knocked out . VIDEO Van Gaal can't wait to get started . It is likely that United will officially unveil the 62-year-old as their new manager at a press conference in the middle of the week, before Van Gaal joins the club’s squad on a two-week tour of America that begins next weekend. It is understood United would have granted Van Gaal a short break had he felt he needed one, but that the former Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Ajax manager indicated he wished to begin work as soon as possible. ‘Holidays are for wimps,’ was the way one United official put it recently. Certainly, United supporters will have been encouraged by what they have seen of their new manager in Brazil. The Dutchman has arguably emerged as the outstanding coach of the World Cup. Moyes was criticised for many things during his difficult season at United. Some of it was unfair but much wasn’t. Accusations of tactical rigidity were certainly understandable and Moyes occasionally took a peculiar approach to the use of substitutions. In Van Gaal, United have a coach willing to change his tactical approach dramatically for individual games and also make big calls during matches. We know about the big stories of Van Gaal’s World Cup: his decision to bring on Tim Krul as a specialist penalty-saver for the quarter-final shoot-out against Costa Rica; his use of former Liverpool striker Dirk Kuyt as a wing back. Tough call: Van Gaal was not afraid to substitute skipper Robin van Persie . Eye to eye: Van Gaal and Van Persie talk in training . FRIENDLIES . July 23: v LA Galaxy  (Pasadena, California) July 26: v Roma (Denver) July 29: v Inter Milan (Washington) August 2: v Real Madrid (Ann Arbor, Michigan) August 12: v Valencia (Old Trafford) PREMIER LEAGUE . August 16: v Swansea (h) August 23: v Sunderland (a) August 30: v Burnley (a) Van Gaal’s work went deeper than that, though. He was clever enough to make the previously disenfranchised Robin van Persie his captain earlier in his reign but not afraid to bring the United striker off — and then explain publicly why — when he wasn’t playing well enough. Equally, he was brave enough to ask Holland to play in a withdrawn counter-attacking fashion that flew in the face of Oranje traditions. He did it because he knew his squad wasn’t good enough to play any other way. ‘Functional’ was how he described this group of players. He had a close enough bond with them to get away with that term. Style can be everything at United, but Van Gaal does not have a reputation as a defensive coach at club level. Close knit: Van Gaal had the full respect of the Holland squad . There is no reason to suggest he is going to turn up at Carrington and ask United to play five across the back. He would have to locate three decent central defenders first. Nevertheless, the ability he has shown to make the most of what he has could be invaluable as he works with a squad that will perhaps not be of the quality he needs until after another couple of transfer windows. Under Sir Alex Ferguson in his later years, United over-performed. Under Moyes, the same players regressed to such an extent as to be almost unrecognisable. Holding the fort: Ryan Giggs has been taking training in Van Gaal's absence . 1) MEDALS: United’s dressing room needs to be impressed after years of success under Sir Alex Ferguson. Van Gaal’s c.v. passes muster. 2) CONFIDENCE: Press conferences in the World Cup would often contain rambling Van Gaal soliloquies where he explained the nuances of his tactical genius. Boring but telling. 3) PLAYERS: Don’t be surprised if he brings one or two players from his successful Dutch World Cup squad to Old Trafford, even if they are for the fringes. Keep your eye on Nigel de Jong and Dirk Kuyt. 4) TACTICS: Van Gaal sees himself as one of the game’s great thinkers. That would make him a dull dinner companion — but a talented coach. 5) BELIEF: One of Van Gaal’s great successes in Brazil was to get his team playing above themselves and believing they could achieve things. United will be hoping for some of that magic dust. Van Gaal’s first job is to perhaps find . the middle ground between the two and the evidence of this World Cup . suggests he may do that. Van Gaal’s control of his players in South America has been interesting. His reputation is one of rigidity but he got his players to buy into his methods and to follow him. He will need that at United. There is something of a ‘medals on the table’ culture in United’s dressing room. The fact Moyes didn’t have any did for him. Van Gaal’s reputation and career will buy him time at United, although it will be interesting to see if he attempts to ‘out’ any of his players as he did here in the wake of Wednesday’s exit. He suggested that two of his Dutch players hadn’t fancied a penalty in Sao Paulo. It was an odd move that ran contrary to just about everything he has done out here. Perhaps he . couldn’t face accepting the blame for the fact he asked a central . defender, Aston Villa’s Ron Vlaar, to take the first kick (Vlaar . missed). Second thoughts: Van Gaal's faith in Ron Vlaar backfired after he missed his penalty kick . Perhaps he felt he could get away with it because he is leaving the Dutch set up. Perhaps he was just a little emotional and regrets it now. Whatever the case, if he tries that in England he may find some players in the United dressing room turn their backs quicker than he ever could have imagined. To the neutral, it did at least prove one thing. It would appear the ‘Iron Tulip’ is human after all.","Van Gaal ready to start work at Old Trafford within days of return from Brazil .

"England should try and follow Germany's example in producing youth teams who can develop together and form the core of the senior national side, according to Britain's FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce. Many of the Germany team who have reached Sunday's World Cup final via their 7-1 humbling of hosts Brazil were also in the under-21 team who trounced England 4-0 in the final of the 2009 European under-21 championships. Boyce, who is also head of UEFA's youth committee, told Press Association Sport: 'The Brazil v Germany semi-final was astounding, the performance of the German team was something else.

Man in form: Thomas Muller celebrates scoring against Brazil - his fifth goal at the World Cup .

'But I have been chairman of UEFA's youth committee for many years and I have seen how the Germans have built up their policy. 'From that team many played at under-19 level, then at under-21 level and in fact won the 2009 European under-21 championships. Like the Belgians, the Germans decided they were starting on that policy and saw it through. 'I think England need to start doing something like that because the Germans are now reaping the benefits.' Boyce, who is from Northern Ireland, believes this tournament is unmatched in terms of quality. He added: 'It has been probably the best World Cup ever. 'We have seen some tremendous matches.

He said: 'I think the refereeing has been superb, and it has not happened by chance. I have seen all the courses and seminars, listened to the instructors, and spoken to the referees and they have told me they have never had such good preparation for a World Cup. 'The referees have been told to only send a player off if they were 100% certain it was a red card, but nothing has ever been said about being lenient.'","Several of the Germany's current squad were part of the team that beat England in the under-21 European Championship final in 2009 .

"As New Zealand international Jesse Ryder smashed a six over the square leg boundary at the Otago Volts' Seddon Park, veteran broadcaster Ian Smith's first thought appeared to be right. Smith mused immediately that the left-hander's destructive flick off his legs was bound for his car and soon enough, with an almighty thud, the dent was there for all to see on his roof. 'That's out of the ground, that's gone, it's downtown,' Smith said as the delivery from Wellington Firebirds' Grant Elliott - no mug with five Tests to his name - disappeared over a hot dog stand. The significant dent on the roof of a car that Ian Smith was convinced was hit as soon as the ball left the bat . Sky Sports broadcaster Smith laughs as he commentates on Jesse Ryder hitting his car with a six . 'It's on my car! It is! I think it hit my car! Oh, the downside of getting a park so close!' The upside for Smith was that the car was a rental, Smith revealed when asked by unsympathetic co-commentator Mark Richardson if he was insured.

"Jenson Button says that love is more important than money in his rocky relationship with Formula One. The British driver exhibited all his skills in coming fourth at Sunday’s Brazilian Grand Prix — five places ahead of his McLaren team-mate Kevin Magnussen. Yet, bar a late change of mind from the team hierarchy, it is Button who will make way when Fernando Alonso joins for next season, despite having outscored Magnussen 106 points to 55 this season. Jenson Button (L) exceeded expectations by finishing fourth at the Brazil Grand Prix . Button is expected to lose his place at McLaren next season while teammate Kevin Magnussen (R) stays . Button accompanies fellow drivers Sergio Perez (L) and Kimi Raikkonen at the Brazil Grand Prix in Sao Paulo . Button is sore. ‘You want to feel like you are wanted in a team and part of the family,’ he said. ‘It’s like if your parents were to turn round and say, “We’re not sure we want you at Christmas this year. But your brother can come, he’s great”. ‘Feeling part of a family is more important than money. ‘Whatever happens next year, the money is not the issue in any way, shape or form, for me anyway. Whether I’m racing here in F1 or racing somewhere else, I do it because I love it. ‘I still want to earn money from it because I feel I have achieved and should get paid for what I do in a racing car and for what I bring to a team. But I’m not a driver who takes the p*** and I will race somewhere even if I’m not getting the big bucks, unlike a few drivers who are out there. Button, with Brazilian actress Debora Nascimento, feels he still has a lot to offer Formula One . Button is expected to be replaced by Ferrari's former world champion Fernando Alonso at McLaren . ‘You should get what you deserve and I feel I bring a lot not just in terms of results but in terms of marketing within a team and working with sponsors, and how I can help develop a car.’ The decision whether to keep Button rests with Ron Dennis, the group chairman, and Eric Boullier, the racing director. Part of the reason they prefer Magnussen is money-related. The Dane earns £500,000 a year whereas Button is on about £10million. Alonso’s wages, which will be in excess of £15m, must be accommodated. The burden will be shared half and half with McLaren’s incoming partners Honda. Button added: ‘I haven’t spoken to Ron since Austin (the previous race). It’s not for me to talk to him. I’m just doing my job, enjoying racing and getting the most from the car, and that doesn’t include discussing the future with Ron because that’s not where my head wants to be. McLaren chief Ron Dennis will have the final say on the British driver's future with the marque . Button admits feeling emotional after reading heartfelt messages of support from fans on Twitter . ‘When I’m on Twitter looking at fans’ messages, I haven’t seen a negative comment for some time. It makes you very emotional seeing how much support you get from the fans. There’s even more support than when I won the world championship. That really does mean a lot. ‘I did some TV and they said “do you want to stay if you can win races?” and I said “Yeah, I’ve done my schooling in F1, I’ve come of age at 34, I’m ready for it!” ‘In Brazil we were almost fighting for the podium, though a couple of steps are still needed to fight for wins. I really enjoyed it and if every race was like that, you’d want to race for several more years.’","Jenson Button battled to fourth place for McLaren at Brazil Grand Prix .

"David Foley enjoyed a man-of-the-match debut for Ireland in Dublin on Sunday, but the Munster lock believes the challenges are just beginning with the World Cup next year. After a scrappy first half which saw Ireland lead 9-0, Felix Jones claimed a brace and Dave Kilcoyne, Richardt Strauss, Simon Zebo and Stuart Olding crossed for tries, with Giorgi Nemsadze responding for Georgia. Foley was one of 13 changes to the side that beat South Africa the previous weekend and took his chance in style.

"Lewis Hamilton will be a better champion for the  image of Formula One than his title rival Nico Rosberg, according to Bernie Ecclestone. Hamilton is 24 points ahead of his Mercedes team-mate with two races, the Brazilian Grand Prix later on Sunday, and the season finale in Abu Dhabi in a fortnight’s time, remaining. Ecclestone, interviewed alongside Hamilton, claimed that he was ‘sure’ Rosberg would win this year’s championship at the start of the season, but now feels a triumph for Hamilton would be more beneficial for the sport. British driver Lewis Hamilton poses for a selfie with a fan ahead of Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix . Hamilton starts behind pole-sitter and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg at Sunday afternoon's race in Brazil . ‘At the beginning of the year, I thought Nico would be champion,’ said Ecclestone. ‘I thought that would probably suit the team better. And in my position I thought it would be better for Formula One to have a world champion who can speak several languages. ‘I thought that if there was going to be any help, which I am certain that there hasn’t been, then maybe there would be a bit more support forthcoming from a German team for a German driver. So yes, I was sure that Nico would do it. ‘Privately I thought that Lewis would be a good champion. He is more widely known around the world than Nico. Consequently, he would be the better champion for the sport. ‘I’m sure that, for example, 80 per cent of the people in America know Lewis, and it’s probably the same for the rest of the world. Most people haven’t heard of Nico. Therefore, Lewis would be the better champion as far as this sport is concerned.’ Hamilton, in action during Saturday's qualifying session, is 24 points ahead of his team-mate with two races left . Ecclestone, in the Interlagos paddock, reckons Hamilton will be a better champion for the sport than Rosberg . Under last year’s rules, a tenth-place finish at today's Brazilian Grand Prix would have been enough for Hamilton to secure his second title. Yet bizarrely, the Briton who starts the Interlagos race in second place behind Rosberg, could win today and still miss out on the championship under the new double points ruling. ‘Around here, what he [Ecclestone] says goes,’ Hamilton said in a candid interview on the official Formula One website. ‘He’s the boss. He wanted double points for last race of the season and here you go: he’s got it.’ Ecclestone interjected: ‘I wanted it for the last three races. That’s what I wanted. I never thought that it would come to this sort of situation. ‘I thought that Nico would be disappearing in the standings and maybe Lewis would be trying to catch up. ‘Lewis would get his act together and by Monza he’d look as if he had a chance because despite being a long way behind, by winning the next three or four races he could catch up - and with the last three races on double points it could have worked. At least that was the plan. It didn’t work out that way.'","Ecclestone reckons the sport will benefit from Hamilton's global appeal .

"Tommy Seymour believes Scotland will only become a threat on the global stage once they stop being pleased just to have avoided a hammering against the big guns. Scotland put on a brave display as they held New Zealand for large chunks of Saturday’s Test at Murrayfield before eventually losing 24-16. They even had a chance to put themselves on the brink of victory but saw skipper Greig Laidlaw pull his penalty wide before the all-conquering All Blacks stormed downfield to score the try which put the game out of sight. Tommy Seymour breaches the New Zealand defence to score Scotland's try on Saturday . The defeat means Scotland’s 109-year wait for their first win against the world champions goes on. But there were clear signs of progress in Vern Cotter’s young side. However, Seymour — who scored to put the hosts 7-5 up after 12 minutes — insists if the Scots are happy to just come close, they will never win. ‘We have to be pleased with the consistency levels we have shown over the last two weeks and we have to be pleased with the performance,’ he said. ‘But we have got to stop being a side that allows itself to take positives when you lose to the best team in the world, because if you do that you start drawing lines that you can’t cross. Seymour, leaving the pitch after a 24-16 loss, says coming close to rugby's big guns isn't enough . ‘We can’t keep saying we are pleased with “this much”, because if you come up against a side and your only aim is to come close, it will never be good enough. ‘We want to become a consistent threat and allow ourselves to be disappointed by the narrow margins. ‘Once you do that you can really push on.’ The Scots were 17-16 down with 13 minutes left when Laidlaw missed a kick that could have put them within touching distance of victory. But the All Blacks came back and Jeremy Thrush found a rare gap in the home defence to score the winning try. ‘It was an opportunity for us to make history. Greig Laidlaw had chance to give Scotland the lead with 13 minutes to go but pushed it wide . Jeremy Thrush crosses for a late try that saw the All Blacks' slender one-point lead stretch to eight . That doesn’t come along very often,’ said Seymour. ‘We spoke a lot about that before the game but didn’t let the occasion take over us. We wanted to go out and fight for a win that had never been done before. ‘Unfortunately we came up just shy.’ Scotland face Tonga next on Saturday, but will be without centre Mark Bennett, due to a hamstring injury. Seymour and Laidlaw are among those who require further treatment.","Scotland pushed New Zealand to lose 24-16 on Saturday .

"Tim Howard's popularity in the United States has led to a White House petition being lodged requesting the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is renamed after him. Howard played a starring role in goal for the United States against Belgium on Tuesday night, but he could not stop them losing 2-1 after extra-time and exiting the tournament in the last 16. Howard's amazing string of saves which kept the Belgians at bay has sparked a string of photoshopped images of the goalkeeper saving the day in various iconic images from American history.

If a petition receives 100,000 signatures the White House administration will formally respond to the request.

"It is almost 28 years to the day since Diego Maradona knocked England out of the 1986 World Cup, but Gary Lineker let bygones be bygones as the former England striker joked with the Argentina legend about his infamous 'Hand of God' goal. Lineker took time out from his role as a BBC pundit in Brazil to appear on Maradona's live TV show on Sunday and, in Spanish, joked: 'It is 28 years ago today, right? How's that hand of yours?'

Pals: Lineker tweeted 'it was great to catch up with Diego Armando Maradona' on Monday . Gary Lineker's search of Diego Maradona ahead of the 2006 World Cup - hosted by Germany and won by Italy - saw the ex-England striker meet the Argentina legend in Buenos Aires. Maradona admitted the 'Hand of God' goal was 'cunning' on his part, but is yet to call it an act of cheating. It emerged the BBC paid an undisclosed fee to Maradona to appear on the show, with £50,000 the alleged amount. The pair looked in high spirits joking together in the studio as Lineker first held Maradona's right arm aloft on the daily Venezuelan TV show, before the Argentinian corrected him with his left. It wasn't all about that infamous goal, though, as Lineker went on to describe Maradona's second, where he took on Peter Reid, Peter Beardsley, Terry Fenwick and Terry Butcher twice, as 'the best I saw in my career'. The 'Hand of Goal' goal has never sat right with the majority of England fans, least of all that day's goalkeeper Peter Shilton, but Lineker seems to have gotten over the controversy. It echoes ex-England midfielder Peter Reid who, in 2011, kissed Maradona's hand and called him a 'top man' during a reunion of the 1986 World Cup foes. Lineker, during his search for Maradona in his documentary ahead of the 2006 World Cup, was told the handball was 'cunning' by the man himself. The Argentina hero is yet to admit to cheating.

"Colin Montgomerie has told the new regime at the European Tour that they must prioritise finding a way to lure Rory McIlroy back to this side of the Atlantic, even if it means competition organisers spending more on appearance fees. The absence of McIlroy is a leading discussion point in Turkey this week, with the Northern Irishman choosing not to contest the penultimate event of the European calendar. His lead of close to three million points in the Race to Dubai is so great that one of Wales’s Jamie Donaldson, Sergio Garcia or Marcel Siem could win both here at the Turkish Airlines Open and the season-finale in Dubai next week and still not catch him if he finishes top five in the desert. Rory McIlroy will not compete in Turkey this week as his lead in the Race to Dubai is so big . That prospect is so unlikely that Montgomerie would like to see the European Tour – on which he will contest his 600th event in Turkey – consider introducing points-heavy finale to the season, as they do in the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup series. He also believes that the wider issue of bringing McIlroy to Europe more during the season should be high on the agenda for the next European Tour chief executive after George O’Grady steps down. Asked if he thought financial incentives would be a good idea, Montgomerie said: ‘Very good. I think the new CEO of our tour has to be very careful about our stars, our Ryder Cup players, the stars of our tour, playing full time somewhere else. Colin Montgomerie says the European Tour must . ‘We've got to be quite careful here. The first thing a sponsor asks is “who's playing?” And too many times, too often, nine or 10 of our Ryder Cup Team are playing full time in America, and we have to address that. The new CEO of the Tour has to address that and Rory McIlroy is part of that. ‘We have to have more of our stars playing more in Europe more of the time. That's a big, big first job of the CEO to try and address that situation. How, I don't know how that's done, because I'm not of the job. Both Sergio Garcia and Jamie Donaldson will compete at the Turkish Airlines Open this week . ‘There's too many of our stars playing in America and not enough American stars playing over here. That would be No 1 (priority).’ Montgomerie tees up at the Turkish Airlines Open on Thursday after a stunning year on the Senior Tour, in which he won two Majors. He returns to competition against what he terms ‘the flat bellies’ with the claim that his form this season reached the levels of his Mid Nineties prime. The 51-year-old said: ‘I believe I've played as well as I did, or almost as well as I did, in the Nineties. I really have performed as well as I would like to have done. ‘I think I'm enjoying the game more than I did. I don't know if I enjoyed the game (earlier in his career). It was more of a job.

"Dallas Cowboys defensive end Jack Crawford spoke of his excitement at playing in front of his friends and family when the Londoner’s side take on the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley on Sunday. Crawford, initially keen to pursue a career in basketball, attended Penn State college after moving across the pond in 2005. He was picked up by the Oakland Raiders in the fifth round of the 2012 NFL Draft, and signed for Dallas before the start of the current season. The 26-year-old has played four times for the NFC East team this campaign, and is eagerly anticipating appearing in front of a home crowd. Jack Crawford (front right) practices with the Dallas Cowboys at Saracens' Allianz Park . Crawford has been a key piece of the Cowboys defense which has surprised many this season . ‘It’s amazing [performing in front of your family],’ said Crawford, speaking at the Cowboys' training base at Saracens’ Allianz Park. ‘Only my brother’s ever seen me play before, so for me it’ll be a special experience to play in front of so many of my friends and family who try to keep up with me over here. It’ll be the experience of a lifetime. ‘Man, I’ve got about 30 people coming to the game – people just think the tickets are free! I’m going to spend time with them, with my family, and try to see them as much as I can while I’m here.’ Having spent his formative years in the English capital, Crawford knows exactly what to expect. It appears some of his team-mates, however, haven’t been so impressed with the city’s characteristic weather so far. ‘For people who haven’t been here before, London is a hard city to adjust to, especially at this time of year,’ he continued. ‘Personally, I think London has the worst weather in the world. We got here yesterday and it was 50 degrees Fahrenheit and wet, so they [his team-mates] got to see the real London. ‘Not too many people have liked it much so far, but it takes time to grow on you and I think everybody’s handled it well. We’re here to do a job so you don’t really get to experience London like you would on holiday.’ Crawford returns to the city of his birth and could play on Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars . Crawford wrapped up warm in north London as the Cowboys begin to acclimatise to English conditions . The Cowboys’ meeting with the Jaguars represents the third game in the NFL’s International Series to be played at Wembley this year, after visits from Miami Dolphins, Oakland Raiders, Atlanta Falcons and Detroit Lions earlier in the season. All three matches have been played in front of capacity crowds, and Crawford explained why he thinks the sport has gained such a following in the UK. He said: ‘You can see it’s grown as a cult, and now it’s getting bigger in the UK. I’ve seen the fan base grow immensely over the past 10 years since I’ve been in America. ‘Once you learn the rules it’s so exciting to watch, if you don’t know the rules it’s just start stop, start stop – it’s boring! For me it’s the most entertaining sport to watch. ‘Some people over here say it’s soft because we wear so much equipment, but it’s different to rugby because that’s more of a side-to-side game whereas American football is head-on so you need the equipment, otherwise your career will only last a couple of weeks.’ Crawford’s Cowboys head into Sunday’s game off the back of two straight losses – to divisional rivals the Washington Redskins and the Arizona Cardinals last Sunday – but he claims they will have no special plans for the Florida-based outfit. ‘At this organisation we don’t really go out of our way to prepare for certain players or certain schemes,’ Crawford explained. ‘We really just practise what we do over and over and over and focus on what we have to do. ‘We keep mentioning it’s about us, it’s about forming an identity, and we don’t really worry so much about the other team. And that’s why we get success.’","Born in north London, Crawford moved to America aged 16 to play basketball but was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in 2012 .

"Turkey's bid to host the 2022 Ryder Cup is on the rocks over concerns about the environment. Turkey are competing against Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain to host the biennial match between Europe and the US. But the developments needed to the Montgomerie Maxx Royal, which was nominated as the Cup course and is this week hosting the Turkish Airlines Open – have been deemed too significant, with the removal of between 6,000 and 15,000 trees necessary to modify the infrastructure. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Turkish Airlines Open day 1 highlights as Jimenez cards 63 . Sergio Garcia stuck behind one of thousands of trees on the Montgomerie Maxx Royal course on Thursday . Lee Westwood is in action in Antalya during the Turkish Airlines Open on the European Tour this week . The Turkish sports minister, Akif Cagatay Kilic, said on Thursday that a new course and infrastructure will need to be built to accommodate the competition. The country is also considering a bid for the staging of the 2026 Ryder Cup. ‘Unfortunately the problem of hosting the Ryder Cup in 2022 is that the Montgomerie course is a resort course and not designed for a big scale golf tournament like a Ryder Cup or even a Turkish Airlines Open,’ said Ahmet Agaoglu, President of the Turkish Golf Federation. ‘If you notice there is not one grandstand on the golf course this week and there is just no place for them due to the enormous amount of trees. ‘We have calculated we would have to cut down 6,000 to 7,000 trees and something like 15,000 trees on the Faldo Course (at the nearby Cornelia) just to make way for everything that goes with hosting a Ryder Cup. Paul McGinley (centre right) led Europe to victory against the United States in the Ryder Cup in September . The event was held on the PGA Centenary Course, which was modified for the biennial showpiece . ‘All the trees are numbered and licensed and environmentally it would be impossible to get permission to cut them down.’ He added: ‘We estimate the Ryder Cup will cost Turkey between 100-200 million euros to host and we have shown our commitment to big tournament golf with the hosting again this week of the Turkish Airlines Open. ‘One way or another we will be hosting the European Tour's Final Series until 2023 - that will be the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey. ‘That gives us another nine years and along with the Challenge Tour event, we are already going to spend something like 70-85 million euros on these tournaments. ‘So together with this continued investment and the new Ryder Cup course we will build, that will cost an extra 30-40 million euros, it will show our commitment to European golf.’","Turkey is bidding to host the Ryder Cup for the first time in 2022 .

He said: 'I often say that in the United States, Robbie Keane is a role model for all the American players growing up in this beautiful game. 'That’s what he has done since he came overseas, he shows to the young players what it takes to become a professional, how much dedication you need, how much commitment you need. 'Robbie is the same Robbie in training as in the game, so he is huge for MLS because these are the type of players that you need to have in your environment to make the league grow and to make younger players understand what the real big players are doing. USA midfielder Mikkel Diskerud (left) chases down Colombia star James Rodriguez at Craven Cottage . 'At the same time, he continues to play for Ireland at the highest level, scoring goals, going back and forth, so I definitely use him a lot as an example how to do it. 'He will leave a huge mark, hopefully a long time down the road, when he leaves the game, with what he has done for MLS over the years.' Klinsmann’s team, who were only denied a quarter-final berth at last summer’s World Cup finals in Brazil by a heart-breaking extra-time defeat by Belgium, are currently in Europe on a mission to increase the gradient of the learning curve which has seen them emerge as an international force to be reckoned with. They lost 2-1 to Colombia, currently third in FIFA’s world rankings, at Craven Cottage in London on Friday evening, although Klinsmann makes no apologies for pitching his players into battle with that kind of quality. He said: 'What we are trying in our process is to realise how the best teams in the world play the game and how we can one day really compete with them and beat them, so what does it take to beat a Germany? What does it take to beat a Spain or a Brazil or Argentina one day and go eye-to-eye with them? 'They set the tone. The tone is set also coming out of the Champions League, the European Champions League sets the tone in terms of tactical changes that you see in the game or how certain teams are put together by the best coaches in the world. The 34-year-old striker, who has scored 65 goals for his country, won his 138th cap at Celtic Park . 'We develop things looking at those things, but at the same time looking at our talent pool and seeing how much we can do in order to catch up and see how we can challenge them at the end of the day, because we have our own different characteristics in certain ways.” The trip to Ireland has also brought back memories for Klinsmann, who scored his first goal for Tottenham in a pre-season friendly against Shelbourne in Dublin back in August 1994. He said: 'It was many moons ago. Yes, I have memories about that. Obviously I was at Spurs a few times last week and saw my old team-mates. They are nice memories to have. 'I was surprised how many Spurs fans lived in Ireland - I think there were 12,000 people and 11,000 were Spurs, so good memories.'","Robbie Keane will miss the Republic of Ireland's game against the USA .

"Newcastle have turned around their dismal start to the season by winning their last four Premier League games in a row to rise to eighth in the table. Fans' unrest over manager Alan Pardew's tenure has quietened, but recent results do not disguise was has been a disastrous year in terms of results. We asked The Mag's Mark Jenson his views on where the jury stands Pardew. We all know that the prime reason for Newcastle United’s existence, is that the club supplies regular entertainment for the rest of the country, journalists especially. In that respect, NUFC rarely ever let anybody down. The club has regularly been referred to as a soap opera but I think circus is a more fitting description much of the time, though that doesn’t necessarily then make all of the fans to be clowns. Alan Pardew has turned things around at St James' Park, but recent results cannot disguise a terrible year . Newcastle have won their last four Premier League games to rise to eighth in the table . The Newcastle supporters haven’t even been left in peace by the wider population to enjoy this surprising, but very welcome, run of five wins in a row. Apparently we are fickle because we didn’t like getting beat every week and now like it when we win a few matches. Meanwhile, without any criticism from the ‘experts’, Liverpool fans call for Brendan Rodgers’ head, only a dozen Premier League matches since he came within a whisker of winning the title. Similarly, every season Arsenal fans call for Arsene Wenger’s head whenever they fail to win two matches in a row, the Gooners having to put up with only Champions League football for the hundredth season in a row. Pardew watches from the sidelines as Newcastle work towards a 2-0 victory away to West Brom . Magpies stars Jack Colback (L) and Steven Taylor react after earning a 1-0 victory over Liverpool . Played 30 . Won 9 Drawn 5 Lost 16 . Goals for 27 Goals against 50 . Goal difference -23 . Points 32 . There is a lot of talk about whether Alan Pardew has ‘proved’ everybody wrong, though obviously what they are really referring to here is the body of Newcastle fans who finally snapped and vocally/visibly, called for change. Accusations of fickleness? Newcastle fans showed unbelievable restraint when they watched their team win only five Premier League matches in ten months from Boxing Day 2013. The record of all Premier League matches over the course of 2014 (above) reads like this for Newcastle fans, this is what we have ‘enjoyed’ from the turn of the year. Newcastle supporters rise from their seats as Pardew pumps his fist during the game against Liverpool . It was not too long ago that the Newcastle faithful was calling for their manager to be sacked . For those of you good at maths, if you knock the recent run of four Premier League wins out of four off these stats, you get won 5, drawn 5 and lost 16. With 21 goals scored and 49 against. Alan Pardew might be showing Champions League form over the last few matches but the end of the season is the only time to judge what kind of job has been done at any club. Newcastle United are the third best supported club in the country and a constant in the top seven Premier League turnovers. Recent results have been buoyed by striker Ayoze Perez who has scored three in his last three games . Anything less than seventh each season is failure for me and Newcastle are currently standing eighth place in the Premier League. Fans will always support the players who wear the shirt but respect for the manager has to be earned. Alan Pardew has made a start in reclaiming that respect but he had better keep pedalling if he is going to inspire confidence longer term.","Newcastle  have won their last four consecutive Premier League games .

"Chris Froome's stance on riding the 2015 Tour de France could be softening after he initially hinted at a reluctance to ride the race. The 2013 winner was absent when the route for next year's race was announced last month and suggested he may skip the Tour to instead target May's Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a Espana, which begins in August. It seems inconceivable that Team Sky would allow its best rider to skip the sport's most high-profile race next July and one in which Froome would be among the favourites, but his comments put his participation in doubt. British cyclist Chris Froome's stance on riding the 2015 Tour de France could be softening . Froome abandoned the 2014 Tour with a broken hand and fractured wrist following three crashes in two days . But, in an end of year interview with the Team Sky official website, Froome suggested he wanted to lead the Tour once more. 'Looking to next year, my key goal is just returning to good condition and being at the front of a race again,' the 29-year-old said on teamsky.com. 'That's a really big motivation for me. Whether it's the Tour or any other race, it's what I love doing. 'I love racing and being able to compete at the front - to be with a team of guys who you enjoy being with, and who you work together well with. 'That's what gets me through the winter when I'm riding those long hours on my own.' Froome abandoned the 2014 Tour with a broken hand and fractured wrist following three crashes in two days. He responded by finishing second in the Vuelta to Alberto Contador. After a period of rest and recuperation in which he got married and was able to reflect on 2014, Froome is now keen to resume training for 2015. Froome celebrates on the podium after winning The Tour de France in Paris in July 2013 . 'I'm actually really hungry to start training again and keen to get back going,' added Froome, who will once again spend the winter training in Keny, South Africa and Monaco. 'The Tour was a disappointment but I've still got a few victories I can be happy about this year. 'Also finishing the Vuelta off in such a decent way, after having all the setbacks - that for me was probably more important than anything else. 'It means I'll be able to go forward into next year without starting from a negative position. I can go in with a clean slate and give it my best shot. 'I think the biggest point of the year for me were the first few stages of the Tour. Starting up there in Yorkshire was something I'll never forget. It was massive and an incredible experience. 'Coming in as the previous winner and having that home support was huge. 'In terms of performance and satisfaction, I think the Vuelta was definitely the one. It left me with the best feeling.'","Team Sky's Chris Froome won the 2013 Tour de France .

"Joe Hart hopes champions Manchester City return from the international break reinvigorated and refocused on club duty after a difficult run. City have one win in six matches after drawing 2-2 at QPR on Saturday to sit eight points adrift of Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea. Manuel Pellegrini's side twice trailed at Loftus Road, going behind to a Charlie Austin strike and a Martin Demichelis own goal, but Sergio Aguero twice netted equalisers to salvage a point for stuttering City. Joe Hart (above) hopes that Manchester City will resurrect their season after the international break . Sergio Aguero scored both times as City twice came from behind in a 2-2 draw with Queens Park Rangers . 'It was a tough game,' goalkeeper Hart said. 'We struggled a bit, but we came back into it well and we did well to get the second goal. 'We stood up, quality shone through. We'd like to have won it, but we'll take the point. 'I'd like to think we're going to come back fresh. We're going to be together for a lot longer now - we haven't got an international break breaking us up over Christmas. 'We've got four months to really get our heads down and get ourselves into this league.' Hart was in the thick of the action, impressing with a series of saves and he was involved in a contentious first-half moment when Austin thought he had scored. Charlie Austin (right) puts QPR ahead in the 21st minute against City, after having two goals disallowed . Hart (left) praised Austin's (right) performance as the two sides shared the points in London on Saturday . Hart kicked a free-kick twice, firstly with his standing foot, before the striker scored. Referee Mike Dean correctly ruled out the effort. 'He (Austin) was a constant threat,' said Hart, who spoke to the QPR forward on leaving the field. 'I just wanted to explain what happened with my two-touch free-kick and what the rules were.' QPR are much improved after a challenging start to the campaign, with manager Harry Redknapp praising his squad. 'It's all about spirit in the team,' Redknapp said. QPR manager Harry Redknapp (above) praised his team's improvement after a difficult start to the season .

"Referee Lee Mason clearly does not rate Seamus Coleman. The Everton right back was six yards from goal with just Costel Pantilimon to beat when a sliding Connor Wickham clumsily sent him toppling to the turf. Simple - penalty, red card. The former, yes. The latter, no. For somehow, Mason kept his cards in his pocket. The whistler's only explanation can be that he did not deem Coleman's chance a goalscoring opportunity. Coleman, do not forget, is a defender who has netted three times already this season – he would have scored. As it was, Leighton Baines equalised from the spot – just – when his scuffed 76th-minute effort squirmed under Pantilimon to cancel out Seb Larsson's free-kick. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Premier League Big Match Stats: Sunderland vs Everton .

Subs: Robles, Hibbert, Besic, Atsu . Booked: McCarthy, McGeady . Goals: Baines 76 (pen) Manager: Roberto Martinez 6 . Referee: Lee Mason 4 . Attendance: 43, 476 . Earlier, in the first half, Sunderland's Jordi Gomez escaped red when Mason, having booked the midfielder for the challenge which forced Gareth Barry off with suspected ankle-ligament damage, failed to show a second yellow for a blatant dive after the Spaniard flung himself over Phil Jagielka's leg. Everton boss Roberto Martinez certainly felt aggrieved with Mason. 'We did not have any luck with the big calls,' he said. 'It (Wickham foul) was a penalty and a clear-cut opportunity to score – it was a red card. 'At that time we had momentum and it could have been very different. I was surprised he was not sent off. Once you give a penalty away it is a red card. That was a major moment.' Martinez – who twice signed Gomez for Swansea and Wigan – also thought his former player should have been dismissed. 'I don't want to see players sent off but those are the rules,' he said. 'Jordi had a yellow card and he got caught simulating. The referee saw it and went to blow the whistle but decided against it. The two big calls did not go our way.' Gus Poyet, meanwhile, felt that Mason should have shown more conviction. 'Maybe the referee thought it was close,' he said. 'Sometimes, when a referee doesn't know if it's that close, they go 50-50 – give the penalty but don't send off the player. Me, I like it to be black or white. Penalty, red card. 'But it was tough for the ref. Too many little things in isolation made him the most important person on the pitch. The best referees in the world are the ones nobody remembers. We shouldn't be talking about him.' As it was, Sunderland finished the game with 11 men and could have made it back-to-back victories when James McCarthy hacked Wes Brown's header from the goal-line in stoppage-time. That they could have nicked three points owed much to Pantilimon, as well as Mason. Sunderland's Seb Larsson (centre) celebrates after scoring the opener against Everton from a free-kick .

The former Manchester City custodian made his first league start during Monday's 3-1 win at Crystal Palace – where he was only beaten by Brown's own goal – and again he impressed. Early in the second half he twice denied a disappointing Romelu Lukaku, first smothering at the Belgian's feet when he wanted one too many touches in the area and then brushing his top-corner-bound blast onto the angle of the goal. Those saves allowed the hosts to take an unlikely lead when Larsson – accepting Tim Howard's invitation to locate the bottom corner from 25 yards – duly swept home a delightful free-kick. Then, the drama unfolded. Wickham escaped red, Baines levelled and McCarthy preserved the point with his last-gasp clearance. Martinez, whose side climbed to 10th, reflected: 'We controlled the game with ease for long spells. We did not use that control to produce clear-cut opportunities. 'I was extremely pleased with the reaction and the character. We did not panic. 'We have shown we have the ingredients of a winning team and that pleases me greatly. I don't think the table reflects the potential we have.' Sunderland – beaten 8-0 at Southampton last month – have recovered to scramble from the foot of the table and up to 12th. And Poyet added: 'The idea was to stop the negativity and all the bad things we were doing on the pitch with a few good results. 'I am a lot happier than where we were one week ago.' Poyet – who confirmed left back Patrick van Aanholt needs shoulder surgery and will be out until 2015 – will now use the international break to nurse several of his walking wounded back to fitness ahead of their trip to Leicester.

"Crystal Palace are sweating on the futures of defensive duo Joel Ward and Damien Delaney as the pair stall on new contracts.

"Four men have been detained by police as part of an investigation into the 2011 takeover of Rangers. The men, understood to be former Rangers administrators Duff and Phelps employees Paul Clark, David Whitehouse and David Grier and former Rangers director and solicitor Gary Withey, were detained on Friday morning by Scottish police working with officers from three English forces. Police Scotland said the four are being held as part of a probe into the 'alleged fraudulent acquisition' of the Glasgow club. Four men were detained by police on Monday as part of an investigation into the 2012 takeover of Rangers . The Rangers squad were put through their paces during training on a wet and cold Friday morning . According to reports in the Daily Record, a warrant will also be issued on Friday for the arrest of former Rangers owner Craig Whyte. It is believed Whyte, who bought the club from Sir Dave Murray for just £1 in 2011, is wanted in connection with the allegedly fraudulent purchase of the club. The operation that saw the four me detained on Friday took place at a number of addresses in England and involved officers from the Thames Valley, Cheshire and Surrey forces. It is thought the men have been detained because of claims that Grier and Whyte were known to one another before Duff and Phelps were appointed administrators for Rangers. A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'Following a Police Scotland operation on Friday November 14, four men have been detained as a result of the ongoing investigation into the alleged fraudulent acquisition of Rangers Football Club.

"West Ham will express concerns to their players ahead of next year's Africa Cup of Nations due to the Ebola crisis. Alex Song (Cameroon), Diafra Sakho (Senegal) and Cheikhou Kouyate (Senegal) are in contention to play in the tournament, which has been thrown into turmoil because of the outbreak. And Hammers officials will hold talks with the trio ahead of the tournament, which is due to start on January 17. West Ham midfielder Alex Song is set to be called up by Cameroon for the Africa Cup of Nations . Diafra Sakho, rushing past Aston Villa's Tom Cleverley, is also in line to travel to the tournament . There are obvious fears from within Upton Park about allowing their players to participate in the competition due to the virus. The club are keeping close tabs on the World Health Organisation's guidelines on the epidemic and will use the information as part of discussions with players. Though, ultimately, the club will let the threesome decide whether they choose to play in the tournament at the start of next year. Morocco this week pulled out of hosting the tournament because of the crisis - and the Confederation of African Football (CAF) is yet to find a new host. Angola had been touted as a possibility, but they have since ruled themselves out of the running.

"Even for the man universally known as Jaws, it would have been a rather difficult concept to swallow. Almost three years ago, upon the resignation of Fabio Capello as England manager, Harry Redknapp briefly seemed destined to succeed the Italian in the post. Fresh from his acquittal of two charges of cheating the public revenue, he seemed - in the public’s eyes at least - a hand-in glove fit. Scotland beat Ireland and will want to dispatch of England at Celtic Park on Tuesday . Joe Jordan still has the same thirst to see Scotland beat England as he has done all his life . For Joe Jordan - Scotland legend, hammer of the Auld Enemy, scourge of defenders in three World Cups and right-hand man to the then Tottenham manager, a very difficult question appeared to lie around the corner. John Gorman had famously assisted Glenn Hoddle at France ’98 but, although a proud Scot, Joe Jordan he was not. In the end, the question was never asked. Just as they had done to Brian Clough back in the day, the FA overlooked the best man for the job, on this occasion in favour of Roy Hodgson. Looking back now, that decision remains a mystery to Jordan. As much, indeed, as the answer he’d have given Redknapp had he asked him to become England No 2. ‘There was certainly speculation about Harry and I thought he was a certainty,’ said Jordan. ‘I don’t know how things would have gone - and no disrespect to anyone else who was in the running - but I just thought Harry was a stick on. I’ve worked with him for 10 years. He would have been spot on for a national team job.’ So, momentarily stepping into the hypothetical, how would he have answered the question that inevitably would have followed? ‘I don’t really know,’ Jordan smiled. ‘It was never something we discussed. We were in the running for a Champions League place and ended up fourth. Chelsea won the Champions League, though, so that was us out. Jordan (left) has assisted Harry Redknapp for years and could have been with him with England too . ‘Would I have gone as his No 2? He’d have needed to have asked me! It would have been a big decision for me. But it never came up.’ Some things are better left unsaid. Ahead of Tuesday’s encounter with England at Celtic Park, it’s evident Jordan’s thirst for defeating the Auld Enemy has never been quenched. He enjoyed heady days with Leeds, Manchester United and AC Milan but none glossed over those epic encounters with the English. ‘I played in nine Scotland vs England games. The only one I didn’t play in was ’75 because we were in the European Cup final and all the Leeds players were exempt except for Gordon McQueen. He’d been sent off in the semi-final against Barcelona. ‘I made my debut against England in ‘73. It came a wee bit out the blue because Willie Ormond had said I still had a bit to do. But Leeds played AC Milan in the Cup Winners’ Cup and I was called up immediately after that game. That was special. You can’t get away from winning your first cap. ‘But the following year, ‘74, was a great year for me at Leeds and we all travelled up after playing a testimonial at Middlesbrough. There was the story about wee Jimmy (Johnstone) rowing out to sea before the game. I still laugh about it. ‘But on the day, he performed. It was just before the World Cup and we were the only home nation who’d qualified, so there was pressure on us to perform. That was a huge game because it would have been a damp squib if we’d lost to England at Hampden in front of 100,000. But we won and that was a great memory.’ England's 100 per cent start continued with a 3-1 win over Slovenia but Scotland will not fear them . Despite being eliminated at the group stage in Germany that summer whilst unbeaten, mental images of that tournament, together with Argentina ’78 and Spain ’82, remain cherished. They also serve as a reminder to Jordan as to what reaching a major finals means for the chief protagonists. ‘I remember Billy Bremner - and he was never a bragger, he did it on the pitch. But he wanted to show he was better by doing it on the pitch. He wanted to show he was better than the other guys in the World Cup. ‘You don’t need to do anything else after that, because you’ve done it and you are bracketed up there with those players.’ For the first time in seven years, Scotland’s hopes of qualifying for a first major competition since France 1998 looks to be built on more than just blind faith. Gordon Strachan has put wind in our sails again. In a section destined to go to the wire, Jordan is reluctant to call the race just yet but there’s no disguising his admiration for how events have turned. ‘I would not like to put more pressure on them by talking about that (qualification). But it’s very encouraging what has happened. It’s very much a Scotland team. The parts are there but when you put it together it becomes a team bigger than the parts. If I was in charge of a team that’s what I’d like to see. You have a growth in experience and in the spirit of the team.’ Wayne Rooney is one player England can rely on, and will thrive in the cauldron of hate at Parkhead . Jordan played in an era when Scotland could afford to overlook a European Cup-winning captain like Nottingham Forest’s John McGovern. But while we will surely never again see such rich options at our disposal, the QPR No2 feels a sense of strength in depth has at least returned. ‘What’s emerged recently is competition for places. I don’t think it was that intense two or three years ago. Now you have players playing at a better level and they have an eye on others competing for their position. That’s great for the manager.’ Left-back is a prime example. With Steven Whittaker required on the right and Phil Bardsley injured, Andrew Robertson has performed with aplomb. As a man who once made the trip from Morton to Leeds as a teenager, Jordan is thrilled to see Robertson cope with the transition to Premiership football with Hull as well as the international scene. ‘He’s done really well. He played against us in the opening game of the season. He’s a good player but there’s one thing being a good player - it’s another thing altogether taking on what comes with being an international player. He’s shown great maturity and has taken it in his stride.’ Jordan’s growing confidence in those who now wear the dark blue does not stretch to him predicting what would be a famous win tomorrow. But oh how he’d relish one. ‘It would be an easier place for me to go back to if Scotland win!’ he laughed. ‘The rivalry doesn’t get talked about much as the game doesn’t happen as often but it’s been a conversation in the last few weeks at QPR as I’m sure it’s been at other clubs. I enjoy that. What did the English think? The usual.’ Perhaps it’s best that question was never asked of him.","Scotland host England in a friendly at Celtic Park on Thursday .

"It may be a fortnight without action in a Barcelona shirt for Lionel Messi, but the Argentine is still having to undergo recovery in the international break. Fans fearing the worst at seeing Messi on a treatment table can rest assured though as the forward still looks ready to take on Portugal at Old Trafford on Tuesday. Messi was relaxed as he sat for a recovery session in Manchester, sipping a tea and talking to a friend. Lionel Messi takes in tea as a standard looking recovery session begins on his left leg . The 27-year-old may also have been in a rather jovial mood, with reasons for his recovery time perhaps due to  a tennis football tournament he had competed in earlier in the day. It was one that looked to be worth it though as he posed with Javier Mascherano and Manchester United's Angel di Maria, with his Barca team-mate proclaiming the trio were champions of the competition. It may not quite prove enough consolation for Argentina who lost the World Cup final earlier this year to Germany - but bigger tests are to come for the trio.

"Harry Redknapp believes the prospect of facing Scotland in a friendly will mean more to England than any of their Euro 2016 qualifiers. The Queens Park Rangers manager feels Roy Hodgson's men are freewheeling in an uninspiring section comprising of Slovenia, Switzerland, Lithuania, Estonia and San Marino. England racked up their fourth successive win with a 3-1 triumph over Slovenia on Saturday and are expected to coast to top spot without engaging top gear. Queens Park Rangers boss Harry Redknapp is excited for Scotland against England at Celtic Park . Wayne Rooney is one player England can rely on, and will thrive in the cauldron of hate at Parkhead . Accordingly, Redknapp believes the prospect of a blood and thunder Auld Enemy clash at Celtic Park on Tuesday will quicken the pulse more than any game on the road to France. 'The group we are in is poor,' Redknapp stated. 'There's no competition in it. It's not like the Scotland group. That's a tough group, with good teams in it. 'England's group really is one you can't judge them on. I watched the game last night (against Slovenia) and the other team are just a poor team. I mean what was their standard? What are they? A Championship team at best, middle/bottom half of the Championship probably. 'I think from the punters' point of view, if you are going to Wembley do you want to watch San Marino or someone? Really? 'You would want to watch them play Scotland or the Republic of Ireland. If you ask me if I'd rather watch last night's England game or the game on Tuesday night, I'd rather watch the game on Tuesday. It'll be a full-blooded affair.' Scotland beat Ireland and Redknapp expects a 'full-blooded' affair when they face England on Tuesday . Having finished bottom of their World Cup group with a solitary point, England have much to do on the international stage to convince their fans they are still worthy of still being considered one of the nations. Tomorrow's game may be a friendly but Redknapp feels the importance of it will not be lost on Hodgson's players. 'I think they will take it seriously,' he added. 'They will know there is a lot of pride at stake. They will come and want to perform well. They are on a good run. 'They can only beat what's in front of them but we're in a poor group. This is a much better test and I think it will be interesting to see how we come through this one. 'The mere fact of England-Scotland and the traditions of the game will come out and it will be a full-blooded affair. 'I remember coming here with Keegan when England won 2-0 but Scotland came to Wembley and battered us when Don Hutchison scored and England hung on for grim life. Those were competitive games.' England's 100 per cent start continued with a 3-1 win over Slovenia, but it failed to excite Redknapp .","Scotland host England at Celtic Park on Tuesday night .

"Mike Ashley has lent Rangers a further £1million after their financial crisis was exacerbated by falling attendances - but has given up the naming rights to Ibrox. Rangers shareholder Ashley recently strengthened his influence on Ibrox by lending the club £2million, a deal which saw chief executive Graham Wallace and director Philip Nash resign and two of the Newcastle owner's close associates arrive in Glasgow. The club announced to the stock exchange on Wednesday morning that the loan had been extended to £3million while simultaneously revealing they have entered into a marketing agreement with Ashley's Sports Direct firm. Mike Ashley has lent Rangers a further £1million after their financial crisis was exacerbated by falling crowds . However, that agreement sees Sports Direct give up its right to re-name Ibrox Stadium, which Ashley secured for just £1 following a previous agreement with former chief executive Charles Green. A statement revealed that Ashley's Mash Holdings would 'make available' an additional £1million on November 26, when wages are due to be paid. The statement continued: 'During the autumn, the club has suffered from lower than expected match attendance which has exacerbated the financial condition of the business. 'The directors have begun a cost-cutting exercise, but further working capital in addition to the facility will be needed before the end of the year.' Ashley has given up the naming rights to Ibrox but the club have entered an agreement with Sports Direct . Nicky Law opens the scoring in front of just over 33,000 during a 4-0 win against Falkirk .

"Ralph Ellis runs you through what we've learned this weekend, from Euro 2016 qualifying action to the lower leagues. This week, there as a win for England over Slovenia at Wembley, a precious point for Wales in Belgium and plenty going on in Leagues One and Two. 1. Jack Wilshere’s man of the match award against Slovenia at Wembley suggests he’s finally living up to his early promise as an England player. The Arsenal midfielder has now started six games in a row for England – his longest run in the side since Fabio Capello first picked him as a raw 19-year-old in 2011. The Slovenia victory was Wilshere’s 25th cap – but only the third time he has completed all 90 minutes of an international. Jack Wilshere was named man of the match in England's 3-1 win over Slovenia at Wembley . 2. One of Chris Coleman’s cutest moves was to convince Hull centre back James Chester, born in Warrington, that he could play international football for Wales thanks to his mother being born in Rhyl. The 25-year-old was outstanding alongside Swansea’s Ashley Williams as the Welsh held Group B favourites Belgium to a goalless draw in Brussels. Chester gave the ball away only twice in 90 minutes and made nine clearances – including one that turned Adnan Januzaj’s dangerous cross away from the goal line. In the four qualifying games in which Chester has started, Wales have conceded just two goals. James Chester (right) helped Wales to a valuable goalless draw against Belgium in Brussels . Chester celebrates with Gareth Bale (right) after Wales earned a point  which kept them top of their group . 3. Former England manager Fabio Capello signed a contract in January to be Russia’s boss until 2018 – but it’s beginning to look very unlikely he will still be in charge next year, let alone when they host the World Cup. Capello hasn’t been paid since his side flopped out of the group stage in Brazil back in June, with Russian FA officials whispering they can’t afford his £8.6million a year salary. A 1-0 defeat away to Group G leaders Austria in Vienna on Saturday night won’t have done much to encourage them to find ways of coming up with the cash. Fabio Capello saw his Russia side beaten 1-0 by Austria in Vienna on Saturday . Rubin Okotie celebrates after scoring the only goal for Austria in their win over Russia . 4. Sweden was once a fertile hunting ground for English scouts searching for bargain players, but no longer, it seems. Sunderland’s Seb Larsson was the only member of Erik Hamren’s 22-man squad that drew 1-1 in Montenegro who is currently playing in the Premier League. And Larsson, a starter in his country’s 1-1 draw with Russia last month, found himself only on the bench this time before getting on for the last half hour. Sweden were held to a 1-1 draw in Montenegro in their Euro 2016 qualifier . 5. Roy Carroll naturally earned plaudits for dashing home from Romania to keep a clean sheet in Notts County’s win at Coventry – but an even better effort was made by Rochdale’s Matty Lund. The 23-year-old midfielder, an unused substitute for Northern Ireland, needed two flights and a fast car to get back in time to play for Keith Hill’s side at Port Vale. He flew from Bucharest to Frankfurt, then caught another plane to Manchester, before dashing down the M6 only to find himself on the bench again. Lund, a former Stoke youth player, got on for the last 28 minutes but to no avail as Michael Brown’s goal gave the home side a 1-0 win. Roy Carroll played in Northern Ireland's 2-0 defeat by Romania in Bucharest . Carroll was back in action for Notts County 17 hours later and kept a clean sheet at Coventry . 6. The BBC’s commitment to sport remains questionable when they can’t be bothered to run The Football League show on international weekends. No Championship games took some of the glamour out of the weekend but there were still enough big games in Leagues One and Two that were worth covering. In all more than 136,000 people paid to see the 22 games over the weekend. As a comparison, a week ago the Italian Serie A attracted 205,000 fans. 7. Mame Biram Diouf’s first attempt to make it in English football flopped when he couldn’t make it at Manchester United – it maybe didn’t help that he was handed the number 32 shirt previously worn by Carlos Tevez. Second time round in the Premier League, and at the age of 26, he’s showing signs of being ready for the challenge with four goals in 10 starts so far for Stoke. The renewed confidence, helped by getting nearly a goal every two games playing for Hannover 96 in the Bundesliga, is also showing in his international appearances for Senegal. It was Diouf’s goal that clinched a 1-0 win over Egypt to put his country into the finals of the Africa Cup of Nations. Mame Biram Diouf scored the goal that saw Senegal beat Egypt to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations . 8. Southampton’s production line of players never seems to stop. Watch out for their England youth international Jack Stephens to be the next to make an impact in the Premier League. The 20-year-old, on loan at Swindon, is normally a central defender but was called into service as an emergency midfielder against Bristol City and was outstanding in the 1-0 win that ended the 22-game unbeaten run of the League One leaders. Jack Stephens, on loan at Swindon from Southampton, in action against Bristol City at the County Ground . 9. James Collins is rebuilding his career at Shrewsbury after a nightmare spell in Scotland when his £200,000 move to Hibernian turned sour. The 23-year-old striker was told in the summer he could leave Easter Road despite having two years left on the contract he signed when he moved north  from Swindon in 2013. His goal in Saturday’s 2-0 win over Mansfield was his eighth of this season, already two more than the former Aston Villa trainee scored in a miserable year that ended with Hibs getting relegated. James Collins scores Shrewsbury's second goal in their 2-0 win over Mansfield . 10. Keith Curle appeared to have taken a mission impossible when he returned to management in charge of a Carlisle team who were rock bottom of the Football League and without a win all season. Two months later he’s lifted them six points clear of the relegation places after the 1-0 victory against Accrington which was his fifth win in eight games. Key has been the signing of free agent Derek Asamoah. The striker hadn’t played in England since 2007 when he walked out of Shrewsbury to force a move to Nice – and since then has been in Scotland, Bulgaria and South Korea before coming home without a club to go to. The 33-year-old former Ghana international got his fourth goal in five games against Accrington.

"Lewis Hamilton heads into the Formula One title-deciding showdown in Abu Dhabi later this month conceding to being in a far from comfortable position. It will be the third time in Hamilton's F1 career he will have faced a last-race decider, having done so previously in his rookie year in 2007, and again in his title-winning campaign of 2008. They were both nerve-jangling affairs for Hamilton as in each he went into the final grand prix with a lead over his rivals. Lewis Hamilton heads into the final race in Abu Dhabi with all to play for in the drivers' championships . With double points at stake the title will be won by either Mercedes' Hamilton or teammate Nico Rosberg . 1. Lewis Hamilton         Mercedes         334 . 2. Nico Rosberg           Mercedes          317 . 3. Daniel Ricciardo       Red Bull            214 . 4. Sebastian Vettel       Red Bull           159 . 5. Fernando Alonso      Ferrari              157 . In 2007 an early technical issue in the race in Brazil resulted in Hamilton missing out on the championship by a point to Kimi Raikkonen who was then in his first spell with Ferrari. A year later only a dramatic overtake in the final corner of the last lap gave Hamilton the minimum fifth place he required to snatch the title from Felipe Massa's grasp as the Brazilian had already crossed the line ahead of him as the race victor. Six years on and Hamilton heads into this season's denouement, where the controversial double-points system comes into play, with a 17-point cushion over Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Hamilton knows a top-two finish will guarantee him his second title, but it is the unknown and unpredictability of F1 that means he cannot rest. 'There is zero comfort going into the last race,' said Hamilton. Hamilton was pipped at the post by Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen in the final race in Brazil, 2007 . Hamilton won his first and only driver's championship on the last day of the season in 2008 . 'There are 50 points to gain, which has never happened in Formula One before, and it just so happens to be this season. 'In the last race you never know what is going to happen, so I'm going into it to win.' Hamilton's positive mindset means he is refusing to contemplate for a moment the possibility he may not be crowned champion. 'Why would I think that? It's not the way to approach any race weekend,' insisted Hamilton. In Sunday's race in Brazil, however, Hamilton underlined mistakes can happen at any time as he appeared poised to take the lead - which potentially would have resulted in the win - only to spin off the Interlagos circuit. That handed the advantage back to Rosberg, with Hamilton coming home second to bring the curtain down on his five-race winning streak. A mistake cost Hamilton at the Brazil Grand Prix where teammate closed the gap to 17 points . The British driver is hoping to be spraying champagne from the winner's podium after the season finale . Again, though, Hamilton is not going to let that haunt him, adding: 'Ultimately it was a mistake, but I'm not going to look back at it. 'It's done and dusted. I'm not going to have any regrets. 'I was just pushing to win, same as every race. I don't think I took any unnecessary risks. 'There are still plenty of positives to take from the day.'","Formula One  championship will be decided at Abu Dhabi Grand Prix .

"French clubs produce more 'top class' footballers for teams across Europe's 'Big 5' leagues than those anywhere else in the world. As such, France’s Ligue 1 tops our table as the best producer of elite talent. Spain’s La Liga plus the top divisions in Argentina, Brazil and Germany make up the top five producers of talent. Fifty players raised at French clubs currently play in the Premier League alone, with 32 more in Italy’s Serie A, 23 in Spain’s La Liga, and 13 in the Bundesliga. France's talent factories have therefore produced 118 players working in other 'Big 5' leagues, as well as a further 373 other places still making a living in France. France international captain Hugo Lloris plies his trade in the Premier League with Tottenham Hotspur . Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny is one of 75 players who have reached international level for France . Some 75 of those 373 players are at French international level already so France has produced 193 current players for 'Big 5' export and / or of ‘international class’. The corresponding numbers for the other ‘Big 5’ leagues are 133 for La Liga in Spain (58 exports), 95 for the Bundesliga (20 exports), 94 for the Premier League (19 exports, most of them not English) and 93 for Serie A (18 exports). Argentinean and Brazilian clubs produce more top-class talent for the ‘Big 5’ leagues (111 and 103 players respectively) than Germany, England or Spain. The data for this part of MailSport’s wide-ranging study on the comparative strengths of the leagues comes the highly respected Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory. France and Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud is a member of the 193 French player playing in Europe's 'Big 5' Andres Iniesta (left) and Xavi (right) are among 324 Spain-produced players still working in La Liga . The 'Big 5' leagues used as a measure of talent production in this instance because the planet’s very best talent tends to migrate to these five leagues - and this is increasingly the case. They are the five richest leagues by income, offering the biggest salaries. Outside the ‘Big 5’ league and the two South American giants, Dutch clubs produce the most top-class players (53 of them currently playing at ‘Big 5’ clubs), followed by clubs from Portugal (42), Switzerland (41), Belgium (34), Colombia (24) and Croatia (21). Spanish clubs have produced 324 players still in La Liga plus 24 in England, 18 in Serie A, 14 in the Bundesliga and two playing in France. Italian clubs have produced 278 players in Serie A, six in the Premier League, five in La Liga and four in Ligue 1. Bundesliga and Premier League clubs have produced 270 players for their own leagues, with the Bundesliga producing 20 for other ‘Big 5’ leagues combined and the Premier League 19 for the other leagues combined.","French clubs produce more talent for teams in Europe's top 5 leagues .

But now, as the 2015 version of the game was released into the public domain at midnight on Thursday, Giggs did not feature in the Manchester United squad for the first time ever.

Should you strike a ball against the woodwork from range, you may notice the bar shaking as play continues, or if your star striker misses a sitter early on, his willingness to shoot and accuracy thereafter will decrease with his lack of confidence. Most professional footballers love trying out the game - Manchester City players were pictured this week picking up their copies before general release - but this year is the first time Giggs will not be able to pick up a controller and play as himself.

"Former Celtic striker Henrik Larsson has stepped down as manager of Swedish minnows Falkenberg. Despite ensuring his side maintained their top-flight status for another year, Larsson has decided to leave his role and the club is now looking for a replacement. Falkenburg were favourites to go down before the season began but Larsson defied his miniscule budget to keep the unfancied side in the Allsvenskan, with the club describing it as their most successful season ever. Sweden legend Henrik Larsson has decided to quit his role as manager of Falkenburg . Larsson, who was a fans' favourite at Celtic, avoid relegation with Falkenburg last season . Clubs: Hogaborgs BK, Helsingborgs IF, Feyenoord, Celtic, Barcelona, Helsingborgs IF, Manchester United (loan), Raa IF, Hogaborgs BK . Total club appearances: 498 . Total club goals: 295 . International caps: 106 . International goals: 36 . 'We would have liked to see a continuation but of course we respect his decision,' sporting director Hakan Nilsson said in a statement, adding that Larsson's decision was not entirely unexpected. On a statment on their website, Falkenburg said: 'We would like to thank Henrik Larsson for his very good work done as coach of Falkenberg FF. 'We've got to know an amazing person and we wish him luck in the future and hope and believe he will preserve this year in Falkenberg in his heart.' The 43-year-old, who also played for Barcelona and Manchester United during his career, has been linked with the manager's job at IFK Gothenburg following the sacking of Mikael Stahre a week ago.

"McLaren racing director Eric Boullier is to sit down with CEO Ron Dennis this week for a final round of talks in a bid to resolve the team's driver line-up for 2015. Discussions have been ongoing between the duo for some time as they mull over who should partner the returning Fernando Alonso, who is due to be confirmed by McLaren by the end of next week. After negotiating his severance payment with Ferrari, as Alonso had two years remaining on his agreement with the team, the Spaniard is to join McLaren on a two-year deal, with the option of a third. McLaren chiefs are yet to decide who will be in their driver's line-up next season . One of either Jenson Button (left) or Kevin Magnussen will leave the team after the final race in Abu Dhabi . As to his team-mate, paddock sources have suggested Boullier and Dennis have a difference of opinion, with the Frenchman favouring Jenson Button, whilst the latter prefers Kevin Magnussen. With Dennis promising in early September to deliver an answer by the end of the campaign in Abu Dhabi, the clock is ticking, although he ultimately has the final call. If Dennis needed any convincing Button's experience was the way to go then his performance over the weekend in Brazil will have helped. In qualifying fifth and finishing fourth at Interlagos, the 34-year-old has now scored nearly double the number of Magnussen's points - 106 to 55. Button has almost twice as many points as his team-mate after finishing fourth at the Brazilian Grand Prix . Fernando Alonso is close to confirming his switch from Ferrari to McLaren ahead of next season . Boullier refused to be drawn on whether anything could be read into the result, other than to state it was 'a great weekend for the team'. Boullier added: 'Prior to Sochi (Russian Grand Prix) we were a little bit down. 'But in two of the last three races now we have clearly shown we are capable of putting cars in the top five - Austin (United States Grand Prix) was a little more difficult. 'But the performance levels are rising, we're closing the gap, and for me it is important to seize this momentum at the end of the season. 'It means everything we have done through the season is now starting to pay off, and we are building for the future, so it's good.

Race Performance 83.53 per cent . Finished Races 17 94.44 per cent . Magnussen Total Score: 194.64 . Magnussen F1 Points: 55 . Following the anomaly of their result in Australia, with Magnussen second and Button third after Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was disqualified, the campaign has been one of struggle up until late. Boullier is convinced the team now have a platform on which to build for next year when Honda return to the sport as their power-unit supplier. 'Chassis-wise I'm very happy,' added Boullier. 'Every development we have done since the summer is applicable on next year's car, so it's a whole concept I have pushed very hard for to ensure it went through. 'So we have improved the car this year, which is very good, and everything we have learned will benefit next year's car, which is also very good.' Magnussen (right) was elevated to second at the Australian Grand Prix but has struggled for form since . The great unknown, however, is how Honda will perform, particularly as they are a year behind rivals Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault with regard to the development of the power unit. 'I'm sure they're going to be good,' insisted Boullier. 'It will be a very steep learning curve for them on driveability, on just working together. 'After 20 years with Mercedes we've had a strong relationship, but this is a new partner, new people, and also a different culture. 'So everything will be new, which means it will take time to fit and match together, but we know it's going to be good. 'For now, as we say, don't over-promise, over deliver.'","Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso is set to confirm move to McLaren for 2015 .

"Louis van Gaal went from feeling lousy to happy after watching his Manchester United team return to winning ways against Crystal Palace. Substitute Juan Mata scored his third goal of the season just four minutes after his introduction to hand United a 1-0 win at Old Trafford on Saturday. Going into the match on the back of a three-match winless run, Van Gaal had said he felt 'lousy', but his team are now just two points outside the top four. Louis van Gaal was pleased with Manchester United's win, despite disappointing first half at Old Trafford . Juan Mata strikes from the edge of the box with a shot that was deflected past Julian Speroni . There was a slight hint of frustration about Van Gaal's persona post-match. The United boss was unhappy his men did not score more goals against a solid and packed Palace defence. But his over-riding emotion was happiness. 'I am happy with the three points,' Van Gaal said. 'They came to defend and that is always very difficult to play as a team against. 'We had a lot of time on the ball, we created possibilities, not big chances, but possibilities. 'We could have scored in the first half but I said at half-time, ""Okay, we played better than the matches before because we kept the pace before and the opponents will tire and there will come a moment we will score"". Mata celebrates breaking the deadlock in front of a delighted Old Trafford crowd after 67 minutes . Fraizer Campbell had the best chance of the game but his lob over David de Gea was also over the crossbar . 'It was Juan Mata (who did) and after that goal I think we created more big chances because then they had to come forward, only we have to finish these chances because they were big chances. 'But I said several times when we are ahead in a game we have to kill the game and we did. So I'm happy, we have three points and we are two points behind fourth place so it is in our hands and that's important.' Mata exchanged passes with Angel di Maria in the 67th minute before dispatching a curling low shot past Julian Speroni off the head of Damien Delaney. Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Marouane Fellaini all spurned chances to score and Luke Shaw also went close with a fine shot after a stunning run from his own half. Van Gaal waves to the Old Trafford crowd after doing 'what everyone in the stadium expected' with a win . Palace had perhaps the best chance of the match though. Fraizer Campbell was presented with a golden opportunity in the first when he went clean through after a mix-up between centre-halves Daley Blind and Paddy McNair, but the former United striker put the ball over the bar. 'Just before half-time there was a misunderstanding between McNair and Blind and I could have been sitting here differently,' Van Gaal acknowledged. 'But the team has done what everybody in the stadium expected today. 'It was not as easy as everybody thinks. But we have won and that is good.'","Juan Mata goal gave Manchester United a 1-0 win on Saturday afternoon .

"Victor Valdes trained with Manchester United's first team at Carrington on Friday and could complete a shock move to Old Trafford within two weeks. The legendary former Barcelona keeper, who is a free agent, is in talks with United boss Louis van Gaal. He was in gym, talking and working with United physios on Friday . Valdes' agent Gines Carvajal and another representative have met with the United hierarchy, with Van Gaal looking to wrap up a deal in the next fortnight.

The 32-year-old's knee injury is currently being assessed by United staff before Valdes completes the move. He was originally on the verge of a deal with United's north-west rivals Liverpool, but had a pick of clubs including Bayern Munich before choosing a move to Old Trafford. With Anders Lindegaard not inspiring Van Gaal's confidence, the Dutch boss has been on the lookout for a second-choice keeper. It is felt Valdes' experience would make him an excellent deputy for No 1 David de Gea. United's players were told the club were taking a look at Valdes and have been pleased to have him train with the squad this week. Meanwhile, Michael Carrick will continue his recovery from ankle ligament damage on Friday. The 33-year-old has been out since July but is due to play for United's Under 21s against West Ham United at Rush Green. The England midfielder was an unused substitute for Monday night's 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion and is expected to be part of the squad to face Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday. The time for recovery between games means he will likely take his place on the bench once again rather than figure from the start against Jose Mourinho's title chasers.

The Dutchman, who has come under criticism for his lackluster performances of late, said: 'Chelsea have a very good team and we have a good team. 'But it's always a bit more edgy and I like that. You can sense that as well with the fans because they are a bit more on top of it in games like this. So in every way it's a game to look forward to. 'There's always a bit of a different feeling but it's not that we're less concentrated for other games but there's a bit extra tension in a good way. You don't really know what's going to happen before the game because it can go both ways.'

"Despite the pride of Manchester being at stake, no local players were to be found in the matchday squad for the derby on Sunday.

"CLICK HERE to see all the stats from the game at Greenhous Meadow. It is games like this, just as much as Champions League matches, when Jose Mourinho illustrates his mastery of the substitution. Having just seen his team concede a remarkable equaliser 13 minutes from the final whistle that seemed likely to send this Capital One Cup tie into extra time, the Chelsea manager immediately threw on Willian and Nemanja Matic. In his first involvement, the Brazilian conjured a goal that spared any blushes. He raced down the left and produced a cross so troubling that Jermaine Grandison diverted into his own net with Didier Drogba lurking.

Booked: Ake . Subs not used: Schwarzer, Terry, Baker, Brown . Manager: Jose Mourinho 7 . Man of the match: Drogba . Referee: Neil Swarbrick 8 . *Match ratings by Laurie Whitwell at Greenhous Meadow . Remember when Mourinho acted quicker than Sir Alex Ferguson as Nani was dismissed against his Real Madrid side in Europe's elite competition? This was of similar ilk. It was cruel on Shrewsbury, who barely three minutes earlier made it appear the impossible might be on. Liam Lawrence delivered a dangerous corner, Grandison nodded down and Andy Mangan prodded past Petr Cech 83 seconds after arriving from the bench himself. Greenhous Meadow, boasting a record crowd for a football match thanks to 486 extra temporary seats, erupted so loud the whole of Shropshire would have heard. Mellon calls himself the Special Brew to Mourinho's Special One, in light of the ale that has been created in his name by a local brewery. He must be credited with fermenting a formula that for the entire first half kept a team of vastly greater ability and resources at bay. That was until the appearance of the Special Drog. At 36, this is some winter to his career. Every day is Christmas it seems. Drogba scored the opening goal here, his third goal in three games to give his team a foothold in a game they occasionally looked like slipping up in. Three minutes after the interval he applied a sure finish to Mohamed Salah's through ball, following a flick from Andre Schurrle. Mourinho questioned the application of some players he was giving a rare start to in light of the Ivorian striker who does not wilt. 'If players that played 90 minutes two days ago were fantastic I expect people who are not playing a lot to raise the level to create me problems,' Mourinho said. 'I love problems of choices, and it is easy to choose my team for Saturday. 'Hopefully Didier will be good for the weekend but we will have to see because right now his character is stronger than his body.

Gary Cahill managed to avoid any headlocks in attacking corners and was well behaved when defending them. Nothing needing the attentions of referee Neil Swarbrick here. 'That's what makes players special and if I was a kid player with this guy on my side what can I wish more? For the kids it is a privilege and they have to learn by example.' Drogba added: 'I played here before, with Galatasaray. Shrewsbury have improved since then. It was difficult tonight with the weather. I wouldn't say I enjoyed the game. It was difficult but I started playing in places like this.' This was the Premier League leaders, unbeaten in six months, against a side in League Two who have been bettered by Hartlepool, Stevenage and Southend this season. Chelsea's squad cost around £300million to assemble. Shrewsbury's? Nothing. The teams are separated by 72 places in the league ladder. It was David lining up against Goliath, except Goliath was on springs and David had two hands behind his back. Still, Mourinho retained four of his starters from Sunday's match at Manchester United little more than 48 hours earlier. Gary Cahill, Filipe Luis, and Oscar all began alongside Drogba. This was the first time he had started back-to-back games for Chelsea since April 2012, when the opponents on both occasions within a week were Barcelona. Greenhous Meadow is no Nou Camp, but it is a finer stadium than you might expect for a League Two club. Mellon has crafted a team who like to pass the ball, and in Ryan Woods have an excellent midfielder. For large swathes they worried Mourinho and when Mangan scored a shock was stirring.

He found the net against Maribor in the Champions League, Manchester United in the Premier League and Shrewsbury in the Capital One Cup. 'To get everyone out of their chairs was one of the things we wanted to do,' said Mellon. 'We're trying to re-build a football club and I cant say how proud I am of my players.' Shrewsbury had the first chance in the fourth minute. Lawrence delivered a corner that Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro rose to head down, forcing Petr Cech to palm away. Shrewsbury were the team conducting incisive attacks. Akpa Akpro's pace particularly troubled Chelsea. One passing move started from the back and involved six Shrewsbury players before James Collins sent his header wide. Chelses were curiously unsure. Just after the half hour, Drogba set Salah away on a counter attack and when he picked out Schurrle in the middle it seemed a goal was inevitable. But the German World Cup winner instead nodded back across and Shrewsbury scrambled clear. That may influence who starts against Queens Park Rangers on Saturday. 'At the end we had a glass of wine,' said Mellon. 'He is an example for any young manager how to operate.' Mourinho and Drogba, examples alike.

"When striker Graziano Pelle arrived on British scenes hardly anyone had heard of him. Even disgruntled Southampton fans, who over the summer had seen their beloved club become a cash and carry with five key first-team players being snapped up by Premier League rivals, raised an eyebrow when the Italian put pen to paper on a three-year deal at St Mary's. And who could blame them? Even if Southampton had somehow signed Cristiano Ronaldo they would still struggle to stay in the Premier League with a squad resembling an arid plain, they thought. Graziano Pelle (left) celebrates scoring for Southampton during their Capital One Cup match on Wednesday . Pelle chases the ball during Southampton's 3-2 win against Stoke City on Wednesday night at the Britannia . Pelle has not allowed this to happen with the Italian part of a revamped Southampton side who are forcing pundits and fans around the world over to eat their words. Since joining the Saints from Dutch side Feyenoord in July for £8.8million, the Italian has scored nine goals in 12 appearances for Ronald Koeman's side. The striker just can't stop scoring with  two goals against Stoke in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday night sealing Southampton's passage to the quarter-finals. If the 29-year-old heads in the same direction, then there is no reason why Pelle won't be remembered as the best Italian to have  played in the Premier League. One thing is for sure, fellow countryman Mario Balotelli won't be pleased with the headlines that Pelle is receiving, with the striker having already replaced him in the national team. Here, Sportsmail  look at other Italians who produced the good and bad in the Premier League. Sportsmail look at other Italian footballers who produced the good and bad in the Premier League . The Good . Gianluca Vialli . Having spent 16 years in Italy, Gianluca Vialli joined Chelsea from Juventus at the creaking age of 32.

He later went on to become the Blues player-manager after Ruud Gullit was sacked in February 1998.

A man who oozed class, Fabrizio Ravanelli like Vialli arrived on British shores from Juventus in 1996. The 'White Feather' will be best remembered for the 1996-97 Premier League season where he donned the shirt of Middlesbrough. Even though his complaints about the city and the club's training complex could fill a book bigger than War and Peace, he was adored by Boro fans. Not surprising when he scored 16 goals in 34 appearances for the club. Fabrizio Ravanelli (right)  arrived on British shores from Juventus in 1996 and celebrates scoring here in 1997 . Benito Carbone . Make that a hat-trick! Striker Benito Carbone also joined the British footballing scene in 1996 when he signed for Sheffield Wednesday from Inter Milan. However, there is a reason why he swapped cosmopolitan Milan for the cold and wet side-streets of Sheffield. Carbone also had disappointing spells at Aston Villa, Bradford, and Middlesbrough. Benito Carbone joined British football in 1996 when he signed for Sheffield Wednesday from Inter Milan . Paolo Di Canio . A cult figure at both West Ham and Sheffield Wednesday. Paolo Di Canio won plaudits for his fair-play, crazy goal-celebrations and mouth-watering volleys which often left opposing goalkeepers for dead.

Gianfranco Zola will always be remembered for his time in England for his massive smile and his ability to score a shed-load of goal for Chelsea, with most of those being important ones too. He ended his seven-year spell at the Blues by scoring a mesmerising lob at home against Everton in 2003. Gianfranco Zola will always be remembered for his time in England for his impressive career with Chelsea . The Bad . Mario Balotelli . Why always him? Mario Balotelli keeps on making the headlines for all the wrong reasons. First he picks a fight with former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini during his time at the Etihad, then the Italian builds a race-track in his back garden. Now at Liverpool, he's yet to score a Premier League goal since making his £16m move. Liverpool's new £16million striker Mario Balotelli keeps on making the headlines for all the wrong reasons . Massimo Maccarone . Massimo Maccarone arrived in Middlesbrough from Italian outfit Empoli in 2002 for an eyebrow-raising fee of about £8.2m. During his five-year stay in the Premier League he was only able to score 18 goals. At the end of their four-year ordeal, Middlesbrough were fortunate not to have to pay Siena to take Maccarone of their hands.

The name of Corrado Grabbi will always have a place in the worst-line up in the history of the Premier League. During his three-year spell at Blackburn, the Italian only managed to find the net twice. Football fans round the world will also be scratching their heads when they realise that he was once on the books of Juventus.

"It could arguably be the surprise result of Euro 2016 qualifying. International minnows San Marino are joint bottom of the world rankings with  Bhutan and are normally steamrolled by all of their opponents in attempting to qualify for the World Cup and European Championships. But that changed on Saturday, when they held Estonia to a 0-0 draw and ended an atrocious run of 61 straight defeats. San Marino players celebrated wildly at full-time after their 0-0 draw against Estonia . The result ended San Marino's 61-game winless streak by drawing with Estonia in Group E . The full-time whistle from referee Felix Brych brought mass celebrations from the San Marino players, who could have been celebrating further if Cristian Brolli's first half header from a corner had drifted into the net rather than past the post. They also had Aldo Simoncini to thank for keeping Sergei Zenjov's effort out and denying Artjom Artjunin as the goalkeeper held on to claim San Marino's third clean sheet ever. San Marino have drawn against Turkey and Latvia in World Cup qualifying, as well as winning 1-0 against Liechtenstein in a friendly ten years ago. Otherwise, they have lost every game they have played. Xherdan Shaqiri scored two late goals as Switzerland eventually claimed a 4-0 win over a stubborn Lithuania side in Euro 2016 qualifying Group E. Lithuania goalkeeper Giedrius Arlauskis had kept his side in it for over an hour but when his error handed the Swiss the lead, the floodgates opened. Fabian Schar (right) celebrates putting Switzerland 2-0 up against Liechtenstein . Fabian Schar added the second and Shaqiri's brace made it a comfortable win for Switzerland who move level with their opponents on six points, six behind group leaders England. The Swiss were straight on the front foot and Gokhan Inler brought the first save of the night out of Arlauskis after just four minutes with Haris Seferovic making the goalkeeper work again just moments later. Admir Mehmedi then fired wide and Seferovic saw a header spectacularly saved as the home side bombarded the Lithuanian goal in the opening stages. Blerim Dzemaili brought another fine save from Arlauskis just before the half-hour and the keeper was keeping his side in it as Lithuania lacked any sort of spark against their well-drilled opponents. Shaqiri and Inler both missed the target in the closing stages of the half and the teams went into the break level despite 45 minutes of Swiss dominance. Deividas Matulevicius gave Swiss stopper Yann Sommer his first work of note to do five minutes after the interval but that was the most respite they would get with Mehmedi hitting the post moments later. Valron Behrami (left) protects the ball as Switzerland eventually beat Liechtenstein 4-0 on Saturday . Xherdan Shaqiri (above) celebrates scoring the third for Switzerland, his first goal of the evening . Arlauskis had been the hero thus far for the visitors so it seemed almost cruel when his howler handed Switzerland the lead after 66 minutes. Shaqiri whipped a corner into the near post and Arlauskis rose to claim but somehow managed to deflect the ball into his own net as he clashed with Josip Drmic. Two minutes later it was 2-0 and once again it came from a corner. The initial set-piece was cleared but when the ball came back in Schar was on hand to apply a low finish with the visitors appealing for offside. With 10 minutes remaining Shaqiri made it 3-0 as some good football ended with Drmic standing up a cross from the byline and the Bayern Munich man was on hand to head home. And in the final minute the pair combined again with Inler finding Drmic and his low cross was finished by Shaqiri to complete the scoring. England remain top of the group after their 3-1 win over Slovenia at Wembley.

"Wayne Rooney has the perfect retreat should he ever doubt his own achievements. It is a place in his home: a personal mini-museum, spread over two floors. By any standard his career has been fruitful and today he will receive a new centrepiece for his exhibition: a Golden Cap set in a glass case to mark his 100 appearances for England. At 29, he is the youngest footballer to reach the landmark. VIDEO Scroll for Wayne Rooney: Euro 2004 is a highlight but I want to win a World Cup . Wayne Rooney, pictured in training on Friday, will win his 100th England cap against Slovenia on Saturday . Rooney admits that he almost quit football at 14 but changed his mind after talking with Everton's Colin Harvey . Danny Welbeck (right) and Jack Wilshere (centre) join Rooney in a race during training at St George's Park . Apart from the embroidered England crest, Rooney's golden cap is entirely hand-made by Toye, Kenning & Spencer. Based in Warwickshire, the company is the world's oldest fraternal regalia maker and has been in operation for more than three centuries. The company is also responsible for the ribbons that adorn the FA Cup. CLICK HERE TO WATCH IT BEING MADE . 'I'll put it in there, with the other things I've collected over the years,' said Rooney. 'The first things you see when you go in are my Premier League medals. 'It's something I'm very proud of. They're on a mannequin in a Manchester United shirt. There's a glass cabinet underneath with all my England caps in.' Here is a rare glimpse into Wayne's World. 'It's probably about the size of this room, split between upstairs and downstairs,' he adds, glancing around a large conference room inside St George's Park, where he is being mined for memories before becoming England's ninth centurion. And there is still time for him to surpass the 125 caps of Peter Shilton and the 49 goals of Sir Bobby Charlton, who will make Saturday's presentation. He stands just six goals behind Charlton and there is no sign of him stopping. Rooney wants to play at a fourth World Cup, in Russia in 2018, and yet he might have quit football at the age of 14, had it not been for Everton coach Colin Harvey. The Manchester United striker trains at St George's Park with his England team-mates on Friday . Rooney will receive this special gold cap from England legend Sir Bobby Charlton at Wembley on Saturday . The Manchester United man shows off a shirt showing the number of England caps he'll have by Saturday . THE HIGH - Euro 2004 . 'It was such a great experience for me to go there at such a young age and start all the games and score four goals.' THE LOW - Red card v Portugal (World Cup QF 2006) 'I believe to this day if I'd stayed on we would've won the game. Unfortunately we didn't go through and that made it worse for me. You start thinking, is it my fault?' TOP THREE GOALS . 'My first goal against Macedonia (September 6, 2003), although the keeper should have saved it. I don't know what he was doing! The goal against Croatia (June 21, 2004) when I played a one-two with Michael Owen. I really enjoyed that goal. And the header against Switzerland (June 17, 2004) in the Euro 2004 finals. My first tournament goal. It means a lot more to score for your country in competitive games.' BIGGEST REGRET - Algeria 0-0 in Cape Town and X-rated verdict on England fans via a TV camera . 'No matter what people might say, we as a group of players care about playing for England. When things aren't going right on the pitch, it's frustrating because we know we can do better. Sometimes it boils over, and that's what happened. It's certainly something I regret.' FUNNIEST MOMENT . 'One of the masseurs put a lot of work into a game of 'Deal or No Deal' for us in South Africa, and drew David James to play. At the first offer he took the deal and completely ruined the game.' BEST ENGLAND BOSS . 'Certainly my best time has been under Roy Hodgson. My goalscoring is the best it's been for England. Sven was great. He really trusted his players and gave us freedom. It was difficult under Steve McClaren as the team weren't doing well. Under Capello it was quite tough in a different way. He tried to bring something different to what we normally had.' MARK OUT OF 10 . 'I can't say it is three or eight. You have to really look at how successful you have been and we haven't been successful. That's how teams and players get rated. I'd say it hasn't always been great but it's always been magical to play for my country.' 'I stopped enjoying it,' said Rooney. 'It was really down to Colin Harvey that I carried on. 'He sat me down and made me fall back in love with it. 'He just said he hadn't seen any player with the talent I had and that I'd be making a mistake. 'I thought, ""he used to be Everton manager, so he knows the game"". Thankfully I listened. That's when I stopped going to boxing and focused solely on football. It was the right decision.' Three years later came an England debut, starting the second half in a side captained by Danny Mills after Sven Goran Eriksson made 11 half-time substitutions in a friendly against Australia. Rooney was up front with Everton pal Francis Jeffers, cheered on by friends and family of the Croxteth pair who put on a special coach to Upton Park. Jeffers scored and never played for England again. Rooney knows his life could have turned out very differently. He might have ended up in landscaping or building like his mates. As it is, he will lead out England at Wembley with sons Kai and Klay, before today's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia. 'I hope this isn't my last tournament,' Rooney said. 'It's difficult when you're coming up to 30 to start planning the next four years. 'You have to be realistic. There's a chance I might not go to the next World Cup but it's something I'd love to do. I never want to cut my career short by deciding not to play for England.' Tournaments have not been kind to Rooney. His fondest England memories are from Euro 2004, even though it ended prematurely with a broken metatarsal. His favourite goals are a decade in the past. It is indicative of the era. Steven Gerrard reached back to the 5-1 win in Germany, his sixth cap. Frank Lampard, like Rooney, cherished Euro 2004. For those representing England over the past 10 years, it has been about regrets and missed opportunities. Amid untimely injuries, red cards and red mists, one moment stands out: his dismissal against Portugal in the 2006 World Cup quarter-final. 'That's the low,' said Rooney. 'I believe to this day if I'd stayed on we would've won the game. 'I beat myself up about it straight away. I was in the dressing room watching the rest of the game. It was difficult, knowing no matter what happened my tournament was over. 'We didn't go through and that made it worse. You start thinking, 'Is it my fault?' We've been stuck, we can't get past the quarter-finals and that was a great opportunity, like Euro 2004 was. 'Not going through, and knowing my red card might have affected that, was difficult to take. I didn't show it too much. I tend to keep things like that inside.' The Manchester United narrative took over. Rooney's red card was for stamping on Ricardo Carvalho, but a wink from Cristiano Ronaldo came to signify a Portuguese plot to wind up England's best player until he blew. Rooney appears to stamp on his Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo at the 2006 World Cup . Rooney looks shocked after being sent off in England's quarter final defeat to Portugal in Germany . 'I spoke to him (Ronaldo) straight after the game,' said Rooney, 'because I knew which way the press would go in terms of us falling out. We had to make sure that didn't happen for Manchester United's sake. 'There was never an issue. I understood why he'd done it. He was trying to win for Portugal and to be honest I'd probably do the same for England. I remember saying to the referee that he was diving, trying to get him a yellow card. 'It happens in football.' Rooney has revealed that he'd like to follow Roy Hodgson (right) into management when he retires . Roy Hodgson insists the best is still to come for his captain of the next generation — and Rooney agrees things are moving in the right direction, but 99 England caps breed caution. There are no guarantees. Given the choice, he would have preferred a World Cup medal to a 'Golden Cap'. Wouldn't they all? On Saturday, he can savour his experiences and his goals and be thankful he didn't pack it all in 15 years ago. 'I'm blessed with the career I've been able to have,' said Rooney. 'There have been tough times on and off the field, but I've never thought this isn't what I want to be doing. I've always believed this is the perfect thing for me.'","Wayne Rooney knows why Cristiano Ronaldo did what he did in 2006 .

The England captain stormed into the box and was tripped as he won the penalty himself just moments after Jordan Henderson's own goal had put Slovenia ahead at Wembley on Saturday. But the Three Lions' 29-year-old skipper smashed in the equaliser from the spot to move on to 44 goals for his nation - just five shy of Sir Bobby Charlton's England record of 49  and level with Jimmy Greaves.

Once we went behind I think we showed that by coming back and winning the game we are in a good place right now.' The England captain also reserved special praise for his striking partner Welbeck.

"Germany picked up their obligatory group win over Gibraltar but the expected flurry of goals failed to arrive as they only managed to score four without reply in Nuremberg. Thomas Muller was on target twice with Mario Gotze raising Germany's lead to three before half-time . An own goal from Yogan Santos midway through the second half made it four but World Cup winners Germany were unable to add any more. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's International Big Match Stats: Germany vs Gibraltar . Germany forward Thomas Muller celebrates the opener against Gibraltar with team-mate Max Kruse . Muller doubles his country's lead as Gibraltar goalkeeper Jamie Robba scrambles futilely across goal . The Germany forward wheels away after his second goal in their Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar . Gibraltar played, as expected, with 10 men behind the ball, leaving just Liam Walker to wait for very rare touches inside the Germany half. It seemed to be going according to plan for Germany too when Shkodran Mustafi's cross from the right struck the near post and fell out for Muller to slot in to open the scoring in the 12th minute. The floodgates did not open, though, because Gibraltar's wall of players were holding them closed well, although a powerful cross from Karim Bellarabi almost ended in the back of the net off a Gibraltar defender. The hosts doubled their lead just shy of the half-hour mark when Gotze put Lukas Podolski in down the left and his cross was an open invitation for Muller to tuck in his second of the game. World Cup final hero Mario Gotze adds a third with his left footed strike but Gibraltar put up a brave fight . Only nine minutes passed before Germany got their third with Max Kruse setting up Gotze to skip past the last defender and send his shot diagonally into the far corner. Walker's moment came just before half-time when his lobbed shot was turned behind by Manuel Neuer. Germany coach Joachim Low covered his face almost in shame as his side, the world champions, went within inches of conceding to Gibraltar. A Gibraltar player did get his name on the scoresheet midway through the second half when Santos turned Podolski's dangerous cross from the left into his own goal, but still those floodgates remained closed. Having lost 7-0 to Poland and the Republic of Ireland, Gibraltar will take pride from their performance in Nuremberg, conceding only four to the world champions who did their duty, but little more than that.

"Since the Republic of Ireland succumbed to a last-16 penalty shoot-out defeat by Spain in the 2002 World Cup, they are the only nation from the British Isles other than England to have since qualified for a a major tournament since. In fact, more correctly, all five of the nations who make up the British Isles - the Republic of Ireland is not part of the United Kingdom but is in the British Isles - hold realistic ambitions of reaching the expanded European Championship tournament in France in 2016. It is for that reason that when Ireland travel to Celtic Park to face Scotland on Friday night, the game will be of huge significance to the potential fortunes of both sides. Roy Keane (left) and Daryl Murphy are pictured in training ahead of Ireland's game in Scotland on Friday . Gordon Strachan leads Scotland out at Celtic Park, a ground he used to call home for four years with Celtic . A win for Gordon Strachan's Scotland side would propel them level  with Martin O'Neill's team on seven points - a total Germany will inevitably reach when they hammer Gibraltar - while victory for Ireland will see them move three clear at the top. In reference to the sheer magnitude of this fixture, Sportsmail looks at the 10 reasons why this is the biggest fixture on British soil for years... 1) Roy Maurice Keane (and O’Neill) Mr Keane livens up any occasion and you can guarantee he will be fired up for this one. Ireland have already been forced to come out and deny that their assistant manager was involved in an alleged scrap at their team hotel and he will be in the dugout at Celtic Park. The former Manchester United and Nottingham Forest midfielder lives and breathes every kick - so it will be fascinating to see how he reacts when he returns to Celtic Park with an away side alongside O'Neill, who will experience an emotional homecoming too. Martin O'Neill (left) and his assistant Roy Keane will return to Celtic Park for this clash . 2) It will be the largest home attendance for Scotland international in 25 years . Celtic Park will be packed to the rafters with a capacity crowd of 60,832 screaming their support during this match. With Hampden still being converted back to a football stadium following the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, the fixture has been shifted to Celtic's home ground. Scotland have not had a home crowd north of 60,000 since the middle of the 1980s - showing how pumped up both sets of fans are for this one. It will be the largest home attendances for a Scotland international in more than 25 years on Friday . 3) Celtic Park will be rocking . There’s no running track and gentle incline of the stands that blight Hampden at Friday night's venue, that's for certain. If you have experienced a big European night at Celtic Park, you will understand the unique atmosphere it generates. The noise of the crowd will hang in the Glasgow air and make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Celtic Park offers a unique atmosphere, like when they hosted Barcelona in the Champions League . 4) Both sides 'could' achieve the unthinkable and knock Germany out . OK, OK, it's a long shot - but it is not entirely outside the realms of possibility. World champions Germany have been suffering something of a post-conquering hangover in this Euro qualifying campaign so far. They sneaked past Scotland 2-1, they were comfortably dispatched 2-0 by Poland and then snatched a late draw against Ireland in their last match. If Scotland, Ireland and Poland keep picking up points, Joachim Low's team may fail to make it to France. Ireland and Scotland could knock world champions Germany out of the competition in qualification . 5) Ikechi Anya is Premier League bound . The 26-year-old is extremely exciting and one way or another Watford’s flying winger is coming to a Premier League ground near you next season. Two goals have already arrived in nine internationals but he offers so much more than that. As well as creating and scoring, Anya has that X-factor to him that sends the crowd gasping with excitement. Watford winger Ikechi Anya, who is certain to move to the Premier League, will be on display . 6) 11 Premier League stars are on show - including  Seamus Coleman . The likely line-ups for both sides will see 11 Premier League stars start the match at Celtic Park. Everton's goal-scoring full back Coleman and exciting winger Aiden McGeady are the main attractions for Ireland and they will be up against Toffees team-mate Steven Naismith. Scotland will also have Crystal Palace's Barry Bannan and West Bromwich Albion's James Morrison in their side. Ireland, meanwhile, will have Stoke City's Marc Wilson, Jonathan Walters and Glenn Whelan, Sunderland's John O'Shea, as well as Hull City's David Meyler and Stephen Quinn on display. Everton team-mates Steven Naismith (left) and Seamus Coleman will be up against one another . 7) Guts on show - can England say the same? No they cannot . The Irish and Scottish players will certainly not shirk a challenge as they put their bodies on the lines for their nations. Whelan, Meyler and Celtic's Scott Brown always give everything for the cause and both sets of players will leave everything out on the pitch to ensure victory. England, however, often lack those same guts and determination when they head out at Wembley. It will be good to see those good, old-fashioned guts on show on Friday. Scotland and Ireland always show passion when they play, like during this qualifier in 1987 . 8) One last hurrah for Robbie Keane . The former Celtic striker is already Ireland's record scorer with 65 following his hat-trick against Gibraltar last month and he will be looking for more. At 34, Keane is still plying his trade with LA Galaxy but he will be keen to impress upon a British crowd once more. He clearly still has his goal-scoring touch and the Scottish defence will be given a torrid night by the ex-Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool forward. Robbie Keane (left) is returning to Celtic Park for one last hurrah in Britain on Friday . 9) McGeady's back at Celtic . The flying winger spent seven years at the Hoops between 2003 and 2010 before moving to Russia with Spartak Moscow and was a particular fans' favourite. McGeady netted 37 goals and provided 83 assists in 252 games for Celtic and dazzled the crowd while he was there. This time in an Ireland shirt, Scotland will be hoping he does not send those fans home as happy as he once did by bagging the winner for Ireland. Aiden McGeady is returning to Celtic Park in an Ireland shirt - here he is pictured in 2009 (right) 10) Strachan’s got Scotland believing they can actually qualify . When was the last time Scotland genuinely believed they had a chance to qualify for a major tournament? They have not appeared at one since the World Cup in 1998 but Strachan seems to genuinely have got the whole nation believing they can reach France 2016. The team are vibrant, pacey and exciting on the pitch for the first time in recent memory and that has re-energised a Scottish crowd desperate to see them succeed. Scotland boss Gordon Strachan has finally got the nation believing they can qualify once more .","Scotland host Ireland at Celtic Park on Friday (7.45pm kick-off)

"Gordon Strachan last night tipped the Tartan Army to transform Celtic Park into a Scotland cauldron. A happy hunting ground for Irish trio Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane and Aiden McGeady in the past, former Scotland skipper David Weir claimed the SFA should have plumped for Ibrox to host the crucial Euro 2016 qualifier, instead. A key figure in persuading the governing body to go for the biggest possible capacity, however, Strachan claims Celtic’s home will be transformed into ‘Scotland’ Park for the night.

Steven Fletcher (centre) leads the way during his team's training session at Celtic Park on Thursday . ‘Tomorrow, that’s Scottish territory and you’ll know it’s Scottish territory,’ said the national manager. ‘There will be 55,000 Scots fans in there. You’ll be in no doubt where you are tomorrow. You’re in Scotland and Scotland are playing … against Ireland.’ Denying there is any kind of advantage for key Ireland figures in playing the match at a venue where some have experienced Champions League nights first hand, former Celtic boss Strachan expects a very different experience this evening. Steven Naismith has been in good form for Everton and will lead Scotland's attack against the Irish . ‘It’s different people,’ he insisted. ‘I believe the atmosphere will be terrific but in a different way. ‘There are a lot of things that will be different.

That would have been more of an advantage for Scotland. ‘The game is where it is, so we can use that as an excuse or we can use it as a motivation to help us win. The stadium doesn’t win the game, the players win the game and the performance wins the game, but I think the game should have been at Ibrox to give us a little bit of help.’ The Scots defeated Georgia 1-0 in a home qualifier at Ibrox last month. Revealing he had a big say in opting for the bigger venue for the Irish game, however, Strachan added: ‘I was part of the decision and now, we’re actually getting more fans in here. Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur will miss Friday night’s game after withdrawing through injury . ‘I enjoyed the Ibrox experience, I thought it was terrific and I’m going to enjoy this tomorrow. These two games, I think we’ve done the right thing, no matter what the result will be that’s for sure. ‘We’re going to get 55,000 Scotsmen in there tomorrow, we couldn’t have done that anywhere else. That will help us.’ A near 60,000 sell-out, the Ireland game will draw the biggest home crowd for a Scotland international in 25 years. ‘It’s a pat on the back for the players that they’ve generated this interest,’ said Strachan. ‘Because, when the game was announced against England six months ago, that was the big game but it’s been put on the backburner now.’ Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur will miss Friday night’s game after withdrawing through injury.

"Ronaldo used to be one of the most feared goalscorers in world football. But  his weight has fluctuated in the later years of his career and into his retirement, and now the World Cup winner has shown he wants to rediscover his athletic touch.

"Wolves have signed Sunderland striker Danny Graham on loan until the end of the year. The 29-year-old has moved to Molineux after playing just once for the Black Cats this season. He will stay with Wolves until December 31 and will link up with his new club on Monday. Danny Graham (centre) has not been productive in front of goal since joining Sunderland . Graham went on loan to Middlesborough last season . Graham told the Sky Bet Championship club's official website: 'Wolves is a good club which has done very well over the last year and this is a good opportunity for me to try and play some regular football and get back to scoring goals.' Graham, who has not scored for the Black Cats in 14 games since a £5million move from Swansea in January 2013, went on loan to Hull and first club Middlesbrough last season. Wolves could be without Nouha Dicko and Bakary Sako in January and February if Mali qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations and have been looking for extra firepower. Loan striker Yannick Sagbo returned to Hull this week after failing to score in four games. Wolves are ninth in the Championship and head coach Kenny Jackett believes Graham can help their promotion push. 'We feel this is a very good move for us,' said Jackett, to the club's official site. 'He has the goalscoring record that we are looking for and experience of playing up front in the Championship. 'With our forward line he brings another dimension now with his experience and goalscoring record.

Portugal suffered a shock defeat against Albania in Aveiro in their opening qualifier but recovered to beat Denmark 1-0 away and as expected made a positive start on Friday night at the Estadio Algarve, with Ronaldo the main focal point. Armenia, though, remained dangerous on the break and were away quickly after the Real Madrid forward had gone down in the box, but the referee waved away half-hearted penalty appeals. Metalurh Donetsk midfielder Karlen Mkrtchyan scampered away down the left, before he was upended by Ricardo Carvalho, which earned the Portugal defender a yellow card. The resulting free-kick was well struck by Mkrtchyan, and as the end of the wall parted, goalkeeper Rui Patricio scrambled across the claw the ball away. Portugal had plenty of the ball, but were unable to really open up a well-drilled Armenia defence. Just before half-time, Helder Postiga shot wide from 12 yards. The frustrations for the home support continued in the second half, when, on 59 minutes, Miguel Danny crashed a header against the crossbar. Armenia's big chance came just after the hour, when defender Taron Voskanyan got up well to meet a corner, but his header was straight at the Portugal goalkeeper. The resistance of the visitors was finally broken on 71 minutes. Substitute Ricardo Quaresma cut into the right side of the penalty area, and his angled drive was beaten away by the goalkeeper. However, as Voskanyan hesitated when trying to clear, Nani was able to get a foot in and stab the ball out left to Ronaldo, who swept it past Roman Berezovsky at the far post. With five minutes left, Marcos Pizzelli failed to really test Patricio with an effort from just inside the penalty area. Portugal almost doubled their lead on 89 minutes when substitute Antonio Eder's header from a corner hit the base of the post. In stoppage time, Pizzelli made space for a shot from the left side of the area, but again fired the ball straight at Patricio.

"Arsene Wenger is adamant that the best is still to come from Mesut Ozil, explaining the Arsenal playmaker returned from the World Cup injured. The Gunners boss revealed his £42.5million record signing was not fully fit at the beginning of the season, despite being given an extended period of rest following Germany's World Cup triumph. Ozil has not played for Arsenal since tearing knee ligaments in a 2-0 defeat to Chelsea in October. Mesut Ozil will show his 'best for Arsenal in seasons to come' claims Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger . Wenger signed Ozil for £42.5million in the summer of 2013 and believes he will get better for Arsenal . The Arsenal boss also revealed Ozil returned from Germany's World Cup victory with an injury . And Wenger was also visibly annoyed when asked  if midfielder Abou Diaby is 'injury prone'. Wenger, speaking on beIN Sport on Sunday, said: 'He (Ozil) will not be back until January. He came back from the World Cup with an injury. 'He had a very good first season with us. I think we will see the best of Ozil in the seasons to come.' But when asked about Diaby, who has suffered injury after injury in the last few seasons and has played just one League Cup match this campaign, Wenger insisted the 28-year-old was not injury prone. Abou Diaby is not 'injury prone' or 'fragile' either, believes Wenger, despite his succession of fitness issues . He continued: 'He (Diaby) is a player that I have an enormous amount of respect for. 'Everytime he comes back, he has to start from zero with another injury. He was a victim of competition. 'A footballer needs his ankle. He was destroyed by a bad tackle (in May 2006, leaving him with a fractured ankle) at Sunderland six or seven years ago which altered his ankle. 'He is not a fragile player. He was the victim of an assassin's tackle that went unpunished.' Meanwhile, Wenger also revealed he tried to sign Juventus star Paul Pogba for Arsenal.

"Jose Mourinho claimed it would not be a failure if his Chelsea team finish second in the Premier league this season, despite being title favourites and having spent £75million in the transfer market. But Mourinho needs only take a look at Chelsea's recent history - including his own past - to know that Roman Abramovich has sacked every one of his managers who have finished second in the league. Mourinho has every reason to be confident despite losing out to Manchester City on his return to England last season - the Portuguese has won the league at every major club he has managed in his second season, including at Chelsea in his first spell at the club.

Mourinho in 2007 (his third season at the helm), Avram Grant in 2008 and Carlo Ancelotti in 2011 all finished second but lost their jobs soon after. Luis Felipe Scolari, Andre Villas-Boas and Roberto Di Matteo never even got the chance to complete a full Premier League season before getting the chop, while temporary bosses Guus Hiddink and Rafael Benitez were not retained as Chelsea finished well off the title pace. Mourinho already has some catching up to do. The Blues kick off their title bid at Burnley on Monday night having seen rivals Arsenal, Liverpool and City secure opening wins, although Manchester United lost in Louis van Gaal's first league match in charge. Mourinho claimed that he could consider this season to be a success even if Chelsea do not claim a first title since 2010. ‘It’s the only league in the world where four, five or six clubs are title contenders,' he said in the build-up to Monday night's match. 'Only one can win. Do the other five fail? I don’t think so.

"Robbie Grabarz can't wait for 2014 to be over but insists a year to forget is in the past as he prepares to start a new season at the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix in Birmingham. Grabarz, who won bronze at London 2012, missed out on selection for the Commonwealth Games as well as the defence of his European crown after a long-standing knee injury finally caught up with him. The 27-year-old decided to get the problem sorted out once and for all, opting to go under the knife and undergo a long period of rehabilitation. Matthew Hudson Smith and Robbie Grabarz  will compete in the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix next year . And while the wait has been a frustrating one, Grabarz believes adversity has only made him stronger as he eyes up a raft of medals – and he says he's saving a special performance for Birmingham next February. 'I had to make a tough discussion in May time on whether to have surgery on my knee,' said Grabarz. 'There was no real trauma or injury it just had been worn out through jumping on it for about 15 years. 'I missed the whole outdoor season and had surgery which was a success. I've been doing my rehab all summer and everything is going well and seems to be looking good for the season ahead. Grabarz poses with his bronze medal from the London 2012 Olympic Games - but says he's had a tough 2014 . 'Missing the championships that I did especially the Commonwealth Games, a home games, was tough. 'Knowing it was going on and I should have been there was tough. It's put a new fire in me to get back out there, compete and win some more medals. 'I've always loved competing in Birmingham for the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix. The crowd's amazing and the atmosphere is fantastic. You feel really intimate with the crowd. 'It feels like home for me now and everyone gets behind me. It's something I really want to do this season. If my body's right I will be there.' But Grabarz, who has once again been awarded top-tier funding by British Athletics, admits the standard of world-class high jumpers has only got stronger in his absence. 'I need to get to a place where I can challenge with the guys who have now pushed the sport on another few centimetres,' he added . 'Jumping 2.40m doesn't necessarily mean you're going to win anymore which is crazy and has never happened before. It makes it exciting, it makes it difficult but it makes it a really good challenge. 'The funding is fantastic. It paid for my surgery, it helped me decide to have the surgery and it's getting me back on track. I can have as much physio and doctors as I need to try and defend the titles I have won and even win some that I haven't.' The Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix takes place in Birmingham on Saturday, February 21.

"George Ford has declared himself ready to wear England’s pivotal fly-half shirt against Samoa while warning his team-mates to expect a ‘nasty’ review following their latest defeat. The 21-year-old Bath fly-half was a second-half replacement for cramp victim Owen Farrell on Saturday, and looks certain to make his first start against Samoa as England look to salvage some pride from what has been a woeful QBE series so far. ‘I think I’m ready, yeah,’ said the twice-capped playmaker. ‘I really want a chance.

"Ronnie O'Sullivan retained his Champion of Champions title in Coventry by seeing off Judd Trump in a high-class battle. The five-time world champion looked to be cruising at 8-3 ahead before Trump roared back to 8-7 in the first-to-10 contest at the Ricoh Arena. But O'Sullivan had enough about him to get to the line first and take a 10-7 win and a £100,000 cheque. Ronnie O'Sullivan has a taste for victory and retained his Champion of Champions title against Judd Trump . Judd Trump didnt go down without a fight, but it was O'Sullivan who emerged victorious in Coventry . Age is serving to make O'Sullivan better, with the Essex man, who turns 39 next month, retaining the consistency that so often eluded him in his early days. His numbers against Trump were simply stunning, compiling breaks of 137, 78, 80, 87, 134, 139, 70, 70 and 109, but a rot-stopping 63 to go out to 9-7 proved to be the most valuable. Trump - who made 102 and 100 himself - was rampant at that point but O'Sullivan gave himself a chance with the knock made without use of the blue or black. Even then Trump was not done and had a chance to clear on the colours to force a re-spot but went in-off the green. Trump decided he had nothing to lose after that and took on a long red at the start of the 17th. He got nowhere near and O'Sullivan slammed in a fourth century of the match and a seventh of the week.

'I would like to say well done to Judd as he had a great tournament. He pots so well and doesn't get worried that I didn't know what to do today.' The revival of O'Sullivan's career is charted back to him starting working with renowned psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters. Since the two teamed up, O'Sullivan has rekindled a previously-absent passion for a sport in which he is considered to be the greatest of all time. 'If I'd have lost I'd have said the same thing, you can't ask for more than that and you want to keep playing,' he added. 'I was happy to be involved in one of the best matches you'll see. Speaking openly with ITV4 O'Sullivan admitted that his work with Dr Peters helped him get back to his best . 'I was playing like this when I was 15, 16 and then I played rubbish for 16 years but I hung in because I'm stubborn. Since I've been working with Steve Peters I have found the form I was always capable of. 'I'm enjoying it, I hope it lasts, but when it ends, it ends.' Trump admitted there was little he could do to stop the force of O'Sullivan. 'I take a lot of positives because the way Ronnie played is the best anyone has played. I marvelled at him making it look so easy and that's one of the best performances I've seen from anyone in any sport.'","Five-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan beats Judd Trump in 10-7 win .

"The families of rival captains Wayne Rooney and Darren Fletcher will watch Tuesday's Scotland-England clash at Celtic Park together. Rooney and Fletcher, good friends and the captain and vice-captain of Manchester United, have jointly-hired a box for their families to share for the game in Glasgow. It will be the first time the two countries have met in Scotland since 1999 when England won the first leg of a Euro 2000 play-off 2-0 with a brace from Paul Scholes. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson: Fitting performance from Rooney on 100th cap . The familiers of Wayne Rooney (above) and Darren Fletcher family will watch Scotland vs England together . Rooney said: 'I can't wait, I think it will be a great game. It will be a fantastic atmosphere. I'm actually glad it's at Celtic Park. It will be even more special there and it's game I've been looking forward to it since the fixture was made. 'I have had some interesting ones with Fletch about the game! We are close anyway and it will be nice to play against him at international level. We have a box for his family and my family. 'I'm sure the atmosphere will be incredible. With the history with England and Scotland - I grew up with David Moyes and Alex Ferguson as managers - so this is certainly one I want to win.' Fletcher (left) and Manchester United team-mate Rooney are close friends off the pitch . 'It won't be a friendly. You have some games with England, when they're friendlies, and they're games you know you should win. I always remember one of the most competitive games I've played for England out of all my games was Argentina in Switzerland. It was really competitive, and against Scotland it won't be like a friendly game.' Rooney has been to Celtic as a fan cheering on his former Everton team-mate Alan Stubbs and also experienced the Parkhead roar as a Manchester United player when they were beaten there in the Champions League. And he wants his England team-mates to try and stay ice-cool on Tuesday. The United pair have organised a box at Celtic Park for their families to enjoy the game . 'We have to make sure we don't get drawn into it being a battle. We have to make sure we play our football and try and outplay them, rather than out-fight them,' he said. 'I have played there a few times and it's an unbelievable atmosphere.We want to win. It's bragging rights for everyone.' England manager Roy Hodgson will allow some players to leave the squad ahead of Tuesday's match but Rooney is adamant he will not be one of them as he closes in on Peter Shilton and Sir Bobby Charlton's international appearance and goalscoring records.

We could be waiting a bloody long while, knowing his Dad.’ On where Ireland stand now in Euro 2016 qualifiers... ‘We have to now try to get maximum points in every home match. It’s important the players step up to the plate.’ On Robbie Keane’s comment that he’s no ‘f***** Niall Quinn’... ‘He’s a lot better than Niall Quinn. Robbie is brilliant for the group and brilliant for the team. He’s as good a professional as I’ve come across.’ Keane believes his namesake Robbie, the striker, is a better player than former Ireland frontman Niall Quinn . On fitness issues for Coleman and McCarthy... ‘You always get the impression from Everton that Seamus and James are both barely able to walk. When they actually turn up and they are walking through the reception, “Praise the Lord, it’s a miracle”.' On attitude of Everton manager Martinez to Ireland... ‘I don’t think he ever played at senior international level and maybe doesn’t appreciate how big it is for us and how big the games are for us.’ Roy Keane is concerned that Everton are putting pressure on players to pull out of international duty .

"Wayne Rooney led a spirited England fightback on his 100th appearance for his country and hailed it as a night he would remember for the rest of his life. Rooney, presented with a golden cap by Sir Bobby Charlton before kick off as his wife Coleen and two young sons Kai and Klay looked on, won and scored England's vital equalising penalty after a Jordan Henderson own goal had given underdogs Slovenia a shock lead at Wembley. Danny Welbeck then scored twice to earn England a 3-1 win and maintain their 100 per cent record in Euro 2016 Group E qualification. Wayne Rooney acknowledges the Wembley crowd before England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia . Rooney was joined by his two sons Kai and Klay on the Wembley turf ahead of England's qualifier . Coleen Rooney was also at Wembley to see her husband claim his 100th international cap . The Manchester United striker, now only five goals behind Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time England scoring record, said: 'It is a great feeling. It was a big week, a big build-up and a great occasion. 'I was really proud to walk out at Wembley as captain of England with my two boys. It is something I will remember for the rest of my life. 'It was tough because they took the lead and we had to show our character. But that will be good for us as a team. Since the World Cup we haven't seen that. After they went ahead we really woke up and showed what a good team we are.' On winning the penalty when he dribbled into the Slovenian area, Rooney added: 'I was trying to get myself a yard to get a shot away and the lad clipped my heels. It was a clear penalty and great we got the goal so soon after they scored.' His enthusiastic manager Roy Hodgson, who made Rooney skipper earlier this season after the international retirement of Steven Gerrard, said: 'It was a wonderful evening for him. It must have been special for him to have his cap presented by Sir Bobby Charlton. And then he capped a good performance by scoring that first goal. The 29-year-old took to Instagram to state it was 'amazing to walk out' with his sons . Rooney celebrates after scoring in the 59th minute against Slovenia on his 100th appearance for his country . 'He is very important to me as England manager but also very important for English football. It was very fitting he got his rewards on a night when so much was about him. 'I am sure he is delighted. He has taken the captaincy extremely seriously, and put all his energy and enthusiasm and passion into it.' Rooney's wife Coleen was among those in the Wembley crowd who stood up to applaud his 44th goal for England which now places him joint-third with Jimmy Greaves on England's all-time scoring list and closing in on Sir Bobby. The Manchester United striker smashed his penalty past Inter Milan goalkeeper Samir Handanovic – who had saved his previous five spot-kicks - after being tripped by Bostjan Cesar, two minutes after Henderson had headed into his own net. Once level, England found it relatively easy to go on after a poor first half and win the match with a double from Danny Welbeck after 66 and 72 minutes. They are now overwhelming favourites to qualify for Euro 2016. Rooney, pictured looking towards Kai, was awarded a golden cap by Sir Bobby Charlton . Hodgson, who said it would be “churlish” to criticise his players for their first-half showing, praised Welbeck whose £16million move from Manchester United to Arsenal has coincided with some red-hot form in an England shirt. The England boss said: 'I have always believed in Danny Welbeck. He was a surprise selection to many people at Euro 2012 and I don't think there has been one squad in which Danny wasn't there, even at times when he wasn't getting a regular game for his club. 'I am just pleased that everyone is recognising his talent. He is doing the business on the field.' Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne impressed on his England debut at right back and could keep his place for the friendly against Scotland on Tuesday. Hodgson has however released first-choice goalkeeper Joe Hart for the game to give understudies Ben Foster and Fraser Forster a chance to play at Celtic Park. Forster was a Celtic player until the summer when he signed for Southampton.","England captain Wayne Rooney won his 100th cap against Slovenia .

"A four-year-old girl has died from the injuries she sustained during a fatal car crash on Friday night which killed her mother and two siblings. Matilda Jackson-Cooke died overnight after being in a critical condition at Royal Brisbane Hospital since the accident. Her mother Keisha Ann Jackson, from Wurtulla on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, had been driving along Glenview Road with her four children on Friday night when her car slid off the wet road and slammed into a tree. She had predicted her own death would occur on the very road that she lost her life. The 30-year-old died at the scene alongside her son Ryan Jackson-Cooke, 10, and her daughter Joan Jackson, seven, according to Queensland Police. Scroll down for video . Four children, Matilda, Ethan, Ryan and Joan, were in the car when it crashed in Queensland on Friday night. Ethan, 11, is the only child who has survived the accident . Krystal Percival (left), the best friend of mother-of-four Keisha Ann Jackson (right) who died after her slammed into a tree on Friday, said that her friend had predicted her own death . Ryan and four-year-old Matilda were found in the grass nearby and appeared to have been thrown from the vehicle upon impact. In the wake of the tragic incident, Ms Jackson's best friend, Krystal Percival, told the Sunday Mail that Ms Jackson had expressed grave concern about driving along the very road she died on. 'She told me ""One of these days I’m going to die on this corner"",' Ms Percival, 27, said. Since news of the accident spread, family and friends have expressed their shock over the incident. 'I wished this has never happened to you I hope I will see you in the next life in the spirit world and your kids as well. You will always be in my heart for ever,' Amanda Lando wrote on Facebook. Two of Ms Jackson's children died at the scene. Her oldest son Ethan, 11, managed to escape with only minor injuries while her youngest child, Matilda, 4,died in hospital . Ms Jackson's eldest child, 11-year-old Ethan Jackson miraculously managed to survive the crash. He only sustained minor injuries according to police, and was discharged from hospital on Saturday. The 11-year-old managed to escape the wreck after the accident and flag down a car that was passing by, Verena Hart, an aged care nurse who had been passing by at the time, told the Northern Star. 'He was covered in blood and grass and mud, he was all dazed and confused,' she said. Ms Hart, Ethan and a policeman that he’d managed to flag down, then went to find the wreckage together in the dark. They discovered seven-year-old Joan, caught in her seat belt and barely breathing at the scene that Ms Hart described as appearing 'like a bomb had gone off'. Ethan was covered in blood, grass and mud when he flagged down some cars for help, according to witnesses, before he led them back to the scene were his mother (pictured) and siblings had been killed . She was unable to be saved by paramedics and died at the scene. Forensic investigators are still looking into the incident, and are considering the issues of speed and seatbelts. Acting Superintendent John Boznjak said told Sunshine Coast Daily: 'It appears that speed might be a factor. There are several factors we are looking at, particularly speed, they are awaiting toxicology reports which will take some time to establish if there is anything in that regard to look at.'","Matilda Jackson-Cooke, four, died overnight after being in a critical condition at Royal Brisbane Hospital since Friday .

"Monaco are keeping in close contact with Arsene Wenger and the French club are still keen to tempt him away from Arsenal. Club officials met Wenger two months ago when they travelled to London to take part in the Emirates Cup. The Arsenal manager made his name at Monaco between 1987 and 1994, winning the French League in his first season. Monaco considered offering him a £10million-per-year tax-free deal, with his contract at Arsenal due to expire, but Wenger eventually signed a three-year extension with the Gunners worth £24m.

"Steven Gerrard was the best English midfielder since Paul Gascoigne, but you have to ask why England didn’t get more out of him. People talk about David Beckham and Paul Scholes, but Gerrard had everything — quick as lightning, he covered so much ground, tackled hard and, boy, could he pass. The first time I saw him was in training at Liverpool when Gerard Houllier brought him up from the youth team. I played the ball into him, expecting this young kid to give it straight back. He turned around and hit a raking 30-yard pass into someone’s feet. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ian Rush and Robbie Fowler discuss Steven Gerrard . Calling time: Steven Gerrard has retired from England duty . Young star: Gerrard training with the England team ahead of Euro 2000 . That’s when I knew he would be special. He had so much skill and, if you ask players who they would want to play like, plenty would say Steven Gerrard. He was like Roy of the Rovers and when he joined the England squad I thought he would show that same confidence. I soon learned he had the same insecurities as every other player. When the team met up I was his club captain, so I went to bring him down for dinner. I only discovered later when I read his book that he was terrified to come out of his room.

"England’s doomed campaign to host the 2018 World Cup is expected to feature far more prominently than the FA would like in Michael Garcia’s report into the corrupt bidding process. The England bid was arguably the most transparent of all those involved in the 2018 and 2022 World Cup elections on which FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert has promised to deliver his verdict next month. But despite the multi-millions allegedly spent by Qatar on winning the 2022 vote, the fear inside Wembley is that England will still be rapped for relatively insignificant breaches of bidding regulations. Garcia wanted extra answers from the FA about four incidents — the £230 Mulberry handbags given as gifts to FIFA executive committee members during a visit to London, the £35,000 sponsorship of a Caribbean Football Union summit, former ExCo member Chuck Blazer’s tour of venues and an FA party at the Saxon Hotel in Johannesburg during the 2010 World Cup. Michael Garcia has delivered a report into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups . The one certainty about the coincidental departures of FA general secretary Alex Horne and Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay within 24 hours is that they won’t be swapping jobs. Gourlay, an unpopular figure at Stamford Bridge, did well to survive five years in that hot seat, but had become increasingly marginalised by busy chairman Bruce Buck and owner Roman Abramovich’s special advisor Marina Granovskaia. Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay (right) speaks with Jose Mourinho during pre-season in 2013 . Manchester City’s £180-a-head corporate package for the game at West Ham on Saturday includes a talk from Ed Sulley, City’s head of research and innovation, on the performance strategies keeping the club at the ‘forefront of the game’… although not necessarily in the group stages of the Champions League. The FA are in talks with former FA Cup sponsors Budweiser about a reduced second tier endorsement. But with the first round fast approaching and no new sponsorship deal in place, it would be a bonus if the American lager brand did another year as the main Cup sponsor to bail out Wembley from embarrassment. Arsenal celebrate after winning the FA Cup with Budweiser final against Hull City at Wembley in May 2014 . Shame about Boat Race . Ascot and headhunters Spencer Stuart spent a difficult year trying to find a new chief executive from outside racing who has experience of running a major venue. So it’s highly surprising that the eventual choice is Guy Henderson, 56, a former litigation lawyer with international firm Allen & Overy and chairman of Wincanton races for the last two years. Ascot will be hoping Henderson steers them on a better course than he took on the River Thames during the 1978 Boat Race when cox of the Cambridge boat that sank in choppy waters. Not that the famous occasion features anywhere on the official Ascot announcement of Henderson’s appointment.

Troubled sports agency Kentaro have gone into administration in the UK following a number of bankruptcy orders in Switzerland.

The cost of the initiative is said to be around £10m to be paid for by lottery funding, with Sport England organising this highly expensive project. No wonder Sport England chairman Nick Bitel’s working lunches with sports governing body chiefs to discuss the plan have had a budget-conscious menu of sandwiches, crisps and a vegetable samosa … if you’re lucky.","Michael Garcia has delivered a report into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups .

"Stalking through the rough grass a runaway rhea scopes its next move. This footage is the first video captured of the South American bird, which is the height of man and can disembowel a human with one thwack of its three-pronged claw. Despite the bird's size - they can weigh up to 90lb -  as the hunt for the runaway rhea of Essex gathers momentum, the locals seem to be treating the whole thing as a bit of a laugh. The Daily Mail tracked down this giant flightless bird – a 45mph ostrich-cum-emu usually found on South American pampas – to a golf course outside Nuthampstead, Hertfordshire. Latest sighting: Charmaine Lake captured this image of the missing rhea bird which can run at speeds of up to 40mph at Barkway Park Golf Club, near Nuthampstead, Hertfordshire . Tracked down: Despite the missing rhea bird being capable of killing a man with a single whack of its claw, locals at the Barkway Park Golf Club, near Nuthampstead, pictured, don't seem concerned . And by close of play yesterday evening, the ‘birdie’ gags were becoming unbearable in the 19th hole at Barkway Park Golf Club. Mind you, they might not be chortling quite so happily the next time they’re poking around in the rough for a missing ball … . For even if we have now narrowed down the chase, no one seems to think there is much chance of trapping this monster feather duster in the near future. It is nearly four weeks since the six-year-old female rhea went on the run from Jo Clark’s smallholding in Brent Pelham on the Essex/Hertfordshire border. Jo has kept rheas for many years – among her horses, sheep, geese, ducks and cats – in order to keep down the weeds on her 11 acres. No one is entirely sure why the bird escaped, although Jo thinks it may have been spooked by the local hunt passing nearby. ‘I followed her for four hours with a bucket of food, but you can’t herd these creatures and so I gave up,’ says Jo, who still has three remaining rheas, all one-year-old offspring of the runaway mum. Since rheas are not remotely maternal (after laying their eggs, they leave the hatching and childcare to the males), it is unlikely that this one will be feeling any pangs of remorse. Certainly, as I drop in on the abandoned trio, they all seem perfectly happy. In recent days, however, there have been sporadic sightings of Mum across a five-mile radius hereabouts. Spotted: A cyclist took this picture of the fugitive South American rhea - which stands at around six-foot tall - in countryside north east of Stevenage in Hertfordshire at the weekend . On the hunt: The Daily Mail's Robert Hardman goes in search of the missing rhea bird in the rape seed fields of Astey, Hertfordshire . On Sunday, civil engineer Tim Bradshaw managed to take a charming shot of the animal in a field of rapeseed just outside the village of Anstey. Since then, a media circus has descended, armed with lurid warnings about the  damage these birds can inflict when cornered. As I rapidly discover, though, we’re not exactly talking Beast of Bodmin, let alone Jaws. ‘We’re all looking out for it now,’ says Tim’s wife, Madeleine, a piano teacher. ‘It’s funny because my husband’s always been a keen photographer and so has his father. ‘His dad once had a picture published in the Bath Chronicle. Now, Tim’s gone one better with a picture in the national papers and we’ve even had Have I Got News For You on the phone!’ Son Harry, ten, is determined to go one better and has been out trying to capture some video footage. Is he a little scared? After all, the RSPCA and the cops are warning people not to approach the bird, even though Jo Clark’s young brood wouldn’t say boo to one of her geese. He said: 'You can see the bird . standing in a couple of the shots, in the others it was grubbing around . in the rape field for food, or perhaps it was trying to bury its head in . the sand. 'It was about six feet high with its head up.' Big bird: The runaway rhea was also photographed near Brent Pelham on Thursday by cyclist Ray Murdoch . Mr Murdoch took these two pictures with his mobile phone after the bird trotted off into a field of rape seed oil . ‘I’m not worried,’ says Harry. ‘It’s good fun.’ The locals have already named the bird Chris – after the singer, Chris Rea – despite the fact that this rhea is a she. There is no great desire to see her returned to captivity. In fact, everyone seems to wish ‘Chris’ the best of luck. ‘I hope people just leave it alone. It’ll be fine out there and there’s plenty for it to eat,’ says Di Pyper. As the joint master of the local hunt, the Puckeridge, Di knows this terrain better than anyone and agrees to be my guide. She first learned of the creature from her sister-in-law. ‘She’d just fallen off her horse and came home talking about seeing an ostrich. We all thought she must have concussion and told her to lie down. Then other people started saying the same.’ Today, she has heard reports of sightings five miles away, near the 12th fairway at Barkway Park Golf Club, and off we go. It’s charming countryside, narrow lanes meandering through gently undulating crop-filled fields sprinkled with thatched cottages and handsome little churches. We’re only 35 miles from London and a short drive from Stansted Airport, but it’s a tranquil spot  with plenty of hedgerows and woods to provide cover for a furtive feathered giant. Barkway Park is a delightful little . club. At the clubhouse, Anthony Smith has just finished a round. Has he . seen a grey/brown South American bird, about 5ft 8in tall? ‘So that’s . what it was,’ he says. ‘I did catch a glimpse of something running . across the 11th fairway.’ Really hard to spot: The six-foot bird has been on the run for a month. They are also incredibly hard to catch because of their fast speeds . Disappeared: The rhea escaped from a smallholding in Brent Pelham on the Essex/Hertfordshire border . The hunt closes in. I meet greenkeeper Carl Edwards. He and his colleague, Anthony Lake, have not just seen the bird a few hours earlier, they have managed to capture it on their mobile phones. ‘Anthony just said: “There’s that emu!”. It was about my height and minding its own business so we started filming,’ says Carl, showing me the result. Sure enough, there is ‘Chris’, snooping around the western edge of the course. She certainly doesn’t seem to pose a threat and just ambles off into the bushes when the two men get too close. Later on, Anthony’s wife, Charmaine, says that she spotted the bird while out with her two young children and grabbed a snap of it on her phone. It is dashing across a nicely manicured fairway as purposefully as a club captain who has just spotted a non-member wearing inappropriate trousers and teeing off in the wrong direction. ‘I couldn’t believe it when I saw it,’ she says, ‘but I’m not sure I’d want to get too close to it.’ By last night, word of our progress had spread and the media circus had started to descend on the fairways of Barkway Park. So why should a wild South American bird take a fancy to golf? Jo Clark has another theory: ‘A few years ago, I did sell a breeding pair to a man near Barkway, and this one will be looking for a mate at this time of year.’ In which case, it may not be too long before this bit of East Anglia starts to see rather more exotic flightless birds running wild and causing mayhem. I fear I can see an Essex girl joke coming already … .","Rhea escaped from home in Brent Pelham, Hertfordshire, four weeks ago .

"After a World Cup to forget, Roy Hodgson now finds himself at the coalface of English football with a squad that is a damning indictment of the lack of depth available to the England manager. We simply lack options. This is not an attack on the players themselves, far from it. Over the past 12 months we have seen a really exciting group of youngsters emerge and no doubt many of them will go on to have fine international careers with England. But they should not have to be the ones fast-tracked into the senior squad when many of them are not even first-team regulars for their club. Calum Chambers, John Stones, and Fabian Delph are all making their way through club football but are now being thrust into the England squad because of the lack of talent out there.

Rookies: (L-R) Jack Colback, Fabian Delph and Danny Rose  have all been given first time call-ups .

John Stones (L) has been selected despite only starting 15 games for Everton . Email Martin Keown with your questions every Thursday at tacklekeown@dailymail.co.uk . Chambers has made an excellent start to his Arsenal career but he has featured in just five games for a top-four club. If you look at what’s available, and form, then he deserves to be in the England squad. But at 19 and having never played for the Under 21s, it’s worrying we have to call on him already. It’s because of the lack of candidates that he has been given his chance. John Stones  is another exciting defensive talent but he started just 15 times in the league for Everton last season and it still feels very soon for him. I was 25 when I first played for England and had already played half a dozen seasons before I got called up. There always seemed to be an abundance of players and before the Premier League arrived it was as if you had to play at least 100 games before you even came into consideration. Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole won 327 caps between them but, if you exclude Wayne Rooney’s 95 appearances, that’s more than the number of caps won by the rest of the latest squad combined. That is a lot of experience gone from the dressing room. There is a lot of excitement around Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge, Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley and Adam Lallana and Hodgson is unlucky that three of those players are unavailable to him now. But it’s almost as if we have skipped a generation. Gerrard and Lampard retired from internationals at the ages of 34 and 36 respectively but most of their potential replacements are more than 10 years their junior. End of an era: Frank Lampard (L) and Steven Gerrard (R) have both retired from international football . Low point: England need to get back to winning ways after a disastrous performance at the 2014 World Cup . See if you can beat the experts by predicting this weekend's results . Whatever happened to the next batch of players, who would be 27 or 28 now? It’s great to give youth a chance, but you need balance in your squad and we don’t have that. Roy says he wants us to develop our young players in the same way Germany has but we are still a long way short of the World Cup winners. Eight of the Germany team that started the final in the Maracana were first-team regulars for the top-three sides in the Bundesliga last season. In Roy’s current squad, only five players were regularly starting for Manchester City, Liverpool or Chelsea. Coaches, fans and the media will have to show patience. In a club environment, fans love seeing youngsters come through the academy and cheer them on, even if they make mistakes. When England fans are thrown together from all over, they expect to see the best players in the country and many in this squad are far from the finished article. I remember England fans groaning at me with each mistake. Arsenal fans were the opposite. Gary Neville was an even more extreme example. But the players will have to learn fast because, with a European qualifier against Switzerland a week on Monday, they may well have to be involved in something far more important than a friendly.

"A whistle blasts as the ‘Orient Express’ slides out of Stockholm’s Central Station. Hugo, our aqua blue-uniformed steward pops a bottle of prosecco. ‘Farewell, fair city,’ he says, saluting the shrinking skyline. For all its easy-going, egalitarian image, Sweden’s capital is an imperial city of gracious facades and plume-helmeted cavalry guarding a royal residence bigger than Buckingham Palace. Stockholm, with its old district of Gamla Stan to the fore, was the start-point for this grand rail journey . No wonder the world’s most illustrious train seems so at home here. My wife, Hennie, and I have flown in to join her on a jaunt to Copenhagen, the first leg of the train’s journey home to Venice. For us, it is a case of relishing the romantic opulence of 1920s-style rail travel, book-ended by another in each of two historic Scandinavian capitals. We stay in regal style at the harbour side Grand Hotel, where Orient Express sets up its check-in desk in a lobby which, alarmingly, is swirling with silk gowns and gents in white tie. Suddenly they all sweep off into a gilded hall to meet His Majesty King Carl Gustaf. Not our fellow travellers after all. Phew. It is a shortish walk to the Central Station, where the gold-lettered, navy carriages stretch along the platform. We settle into our mahogany-panelled cabin. There is a washbasin in a corner cabinet, but loos are in a shared compartment down the corridor (another touch of 1920s authenticity). Nor are there showers - which is why every night on board is followed by a city hotel stay. Another route: Although the train's most famous destination is Venice, it also serves other European cities . This privately-run train is not exactly heir to the renowned service immortalised by Agatha Christie which connected European cities with Istanbul. On the other hand, the Twenties and Thirties vintage rail coaches restored by the Venice Simplon Orient-Express (VSOE) company clearly share the same gene pool. Calais-to-Venice is the train’s stock-in-trade. But these days the company sets its bounds wider, with numerous different European departures. Modern trains designed for speed and with wi-fi can make the journey down Sweden’s east coast and over the Oresund Bridge to Copenhagen in less than five hours. However, the point of this venture is to stretch and savour the experience, so instead we strike out first across central Sweden towards Gothenburg. From here, our meandering route takes us down the west coast to Malmo on the country’s southern tip, facing the Danish capital. Between dark tunnels we snake alongside lakes and through forests of fir hung with lichen beards. Silver service: Guests on the Venice-Simplon-Orient-Express step up into a world of luxury and sophistication . But bewitching though the landscape proves, for most people the focus of this trip is the on-board scenery. Dinner is the principal event, served in a trio of dining cars decorated with art deco  marquetry and Lalique glass panels. Hennie slips on a chic mauve dress, I change into my suit and tie and we settle down à deux to chef Christian Bodiguel’s four-course dinner. The menu fuses Michelin star-standard classical French with Nordic twists; fillets of reindeer marinated in aquavit, cooked in a cloudberry sauce. Ah, cloudberries, those silky golden nuggets of appley rapture from the Arctic. What a touch. After that we have digestifs in the bar car, where a pianist in a silver suit sits at a baby grand tinkling melodies including several Abba tunes (inevitable, I suppose). At least half the company is Scandinavian, and a few liqueurs later an impromptu singalong breaks out. Meanwhile, Hugo is busy transforming the velvet bench seats of our cabin into roomy upper and lower bunks made up with crisp linen. ‘Whose turn is it to go on top?’ giggles a tipsy lady down the corridor to her tuxedoed beau. Hugo’s sangfroid holds firm: The pinnacle of sophisticated travel this train may be, but I get the impression he is used to hearing variations on this bit of ribaldry. Danish delight: Copenhagen, with its pretty Nyhavn district, was the final destination . The train rocks us to sleep. Lights flicker across the window blind as Swedish stations and a Viking incarnation of Hercule Poirot weaves in and out of my dreams. We awake to glimpses of inlets on the Kattegat Sea. Croissants, coffee and fruit are served in our cabin as local people film us from bridges and level crossings. When we stop at Ängelholm station, the platform is thronged with fans. We feel like film stars, though the real celebrity is the train. In the end there is a snag. The only locomotive allowed to haul these carriages over the Oresund Bridge lacks a licence to pull passengers. So we wave goodbye to the Orient Express - or rather, the staff all line up on the platform and wave to us - at Malmo. We cross the 12-km bridge in a plush bus, leaving our luggage to continue in grandeur on the  otherwise empty train, and  miraculously it reappears in our Copenhagen hotel room. Magic. The .

"When England last ventured north to play in Glasgow, a bizarre diamond rush was unfolding in the Scottish Highlands; one which appears to have since fizzled out and come to nothing. As they make the same journey, 15 years on, Roy Hodgson is polishing his formation and exploring options while hoping the sparkle he discovered in Switzerland proves to be more than a flash in the pan. England’s midfield diamond caught the Swiss by surprise in September but has enjoyed limited success since and was abandoned by Hodgson at half-time during Saturday’s 3-1 win against Slovenia at Wembley. England boss Roy Hodgson may decide that time is running out for his players to impress in new system . Hodgson introduced the diamond system to his England players in order to get the best out of Raheem Sterling . Sterling claimed an assist in the second half after being moved out to the right-hand side of England's attack . Click HERE to read Rob Draper's match report from Wembley . Has it served its purpose? After all, it was designed to get Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling into the team without dropping Wayne Rooney. But Sturridge was injured in training before that game in Basle and Sterling is not in the same irresistible form. Success came at Wembley on Saturday when Hodgson changed to a 4-3-3 with Sterling on the right and Danny Welbeck wide on the left — where the Arsenal man performed with more energy and commitment than Hodgson might have expected from Sturridge in the same position, and scored twice. It has been an awful couple of months for Sturridge and yet Hodgson’s switch to the diamond in Switzerland came with a feeling that this had been decreed as the best way to Euro 2016 and beyond. It was the way to cram England’s best players on to the pitch, and into key areas, which logic dictates offers the best chance of success when stronger teams come into competitive range, at a tournament. Without another sea-change, the next 18 months is about refinement: helping players understand the complexities of the system and how to react when it fails, as it did in the first half against Slovenia. ‘We’re moving in the right direction,’ said Hodgson. ‘I do think we can get a lot better, but we can’t do more at the moment than keep working at our game and trying to win the games in front of us. We won’t be patting ourselves too much on the back. We know there’s a long way to go before France 2016. Daniel Sturridge has missed England's last four games due to the injury he sustained in training . Jack Wilshere had been deployed as a defensive midfielder in England's midfield . ‘We know there are a lot of stern tests ahead of us and it starts in Scotland. I hope the players who get a chance to play will a) be able to stand up to any pressures and the crowd pressure and b) learn from it. Any lessons we take will only be valuable in the future.’ Glasgow will test England’s character while challenging their strategy. Can they develop this system against a confident and in-form team amid the frenzy of Celtic Park? When Sir Alf Ramsey was greeted warmly by a Scottish football writer at Glasgow Airport before this fixture in 1968, he is said to have replied: ‘Welcome to Scotland? You must be f****** joking!’ The job, these days, demands a little more diplomacy. ‘I will change the team in Scotland,’ said Hodgson. ‘But we are not looking to play a totally different team because we know that is going to be a tough game. A game like this in Scotland will probably tell me a little bit more about this team. ‘We know what we’re in for and we know the way we play and we’re up for it. I am going to need some experienced players on the field. I can’t just make wholesale changes because we want to go up there and give a performance.’ The England boss wants to look at particular players in specific roles, including Stewart Downing within the diamond. Downing was among the substitutes at Wembley on Saturday but never likely to come on because he was troubled during the warm-up by a slight knee injury picked up in training last week. Hodgson wants to give Stewart Downing (right) a run out against Scotland at Celtic Park on Tuesday . Ben Foster (left) or Fraser Forster (centre) will come replace the rested Joe Hart (right) against Scotland . Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster will feel at home if he wins his third England cap when they face the Scots at Celtic Park. Hexham-born Forster, who is 26, lost just 17 of his 140 Scottish Premiership matches for Celtic after joining them from Newcastle in 2010, initially on loan. Since transferring to the Saints in August for £10million, he has conceded only five Premier League goals, helping them become this season’s surprise package. ‘I do believe he’ll be available against Scotland,’ said Hodgson. ‘That’s good news because I’d like to see him in an England shirt at some stage during the game.’ Michael Carrick had been earmarked for the game in Glasgow until he pulled out injured. Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers are others who might be tested again, and Saido Berahino is in contention for a first cap, possibly from the bench. Having sent Joe Hart home for a break, there will be a rare chance in goal for Ben Foster or Fraser Forster, who will be returning to Celtic Park for the first time since his £10million transfer to Southampton in August. In four years as Celtic keeper, Forster broke the club record for successive clean sheets and the Scottish League record for time without conceding a goal, and won three SPL titles and two Scottish Cups. ‘I will be forever grateful for what Celtic did for me,’ said Forster. ‘They really believed in me. Stevie Woods, the goalkeeping coach, put in a lot of time and effort and really brought me on. ‘It will be good to go back. I know a few of the lads in their team. To play in a Scotland-England game would be a dream come true. It’s an unbelievable atmosphere. The Barcelona players said it was the best they’d ever played in. That tells you how unique it is.’","Roy Hodgson decided to change to a 4-3-3 formation during second half of 3-1 win against Slovenia .

"Five years ago Southampton were in the League One relegation zone, had been deducted 10 points and were selling tickets to students for £3. It was a club which had been on the verge of bankruptcy and was crashing towards oblivion until they were bought by Markus Liebherr who turned them around. Their rise up the football pyramid, now sitting second in the Barclays Premier League, has been one of the swiftest in English football. Ronald Koeman has guided Southampton to second place in the Premier League so far this season . Southampton lost a raft of frontline players over the summer including Luke Shaw (right) who went to United . Arsenal defender Calum Chambers was another player to move on over the summer, to Arsenal (right) Sandwiched between current champions Manchester City and Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, the name Southampton is still an unusual sight. However, this is not entirely new territory for fans of the south coast club, who sat third in the table after 11 games last season. But it was at this exact stage that reality kicked in and three successive defeats against Arsenal, Chelsea and Aston Villa started a run of six in a row without victory. Dejan Lovren anchored Southampton's defence last season (left) but he is now on the books at Liverpool . With manager Ronald Koeman – whose managerial brilliance rebuilt a severely wounded side bereft of its stars – now talking of a top four finish and those elusive Champions League places as a possibility, the Christmas period will be the true test of their credentials. 'I’m not looking too much at the rest of the teams,' Koeman said after their win against Leicester on Saturday. 'Maybe only in the aspect that I think that I haven’t seen until now teams much better than Southampton. A top-four finish would be fantastic.' From the end of November until the start of the new year they face City and Chelsea and also twice come up against Arsenal and Manchester United. After a slow start to his Saints career, Shane Long scored both goals in Southampton's 2-0 win over Leicester . Striker Graziano Pelle (right) has been in sublime form for Southampton this season firing in 10 goals . Defender Ryan Bertrand (right), on loan for Chelsea, has been outstanding at the back for Koeman's side . They have won 11 times this season, but Liverpool and Tottenham were their only defeats, suggesting the bigger clubs might cause them problems. Southampton have filled the top flight with some of its biggest names at some of the biggest clubs. Luke Shaw at Manchester United, Calum Chambers at Arsenal, Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert at Liverpool and their former manager Mauricio Pochettino now in charge at Spurs. But at the moment it is Southampton – and 'the Southampton way' philosophy by which the club runs – who top them all. Their replacements have been some of the buys of the summer – striker Graziano Pelle has fired in 10 goals, forward Dusan Tadic has more than filled Lallana's boots and Toby Alderweireld and Ryan Bertrand have shored up the defence. Until the weekend, new recruit Shane Long was playing in the others' shadows until his double downed Leicester. 'It has kind of been on us as a team with so many players leaving and so many players coming in and everyone expecting us to have a bad season,' Long said. 'Second in the league takes some doing and we’re very proud of that.'","Ronald Koeman's Southampton side are currently second in the Premier League table behind unbeaten leaders Chelsea .

"California users of STD dating site PositiveSingles will receive a total of $16.5 million in damages after the site shared their personal information despite the promise of confidentiality, authorities say. The verdict was rendered in the amount of approximately $15 million in punitive damages and $1.5 million of compensatory damages to California users of the site under the California Legal Remedies Act, according to a Business Wire. A lawsuit alleged that the site's registration page states that the site, marketed toward people with sexually transmitted diseases, is '100% confidential' and that it does 'not disclose, sell, or rent any personally identifiable information to any third party organizations.' PositiveSingles: California users of STD dating site PositiveSingles will receive a total of $16.5 million in damages after the site shared the personal information of its users despite the promise of confidentiality . However, BBC reports, that PositiveSingles' parent site -- SuccessfulMatch -- runs a series of other dating sites and SuccessfulMatch used the photos and personal information of PositiveSingles users on many of its subsidiary dating sites such as MeetBlackPOZ, ChristianSafeHaven, AidsDate, and HerpesinMouth. Though the site promised privacy, it turns out PositiveSingles was one of more than a thousand different sites placing user information -- including their STD status -- into a single database making it available to almost anyone. The suit also stated that '[SuccessfulMatch] fraudulently and deceptively failed to disclose that profiles created through PositiveSingles.com could be viewed on Defendant's affiliate sites.' Sites: PositiveSingles users had their profile information funneled to sites like HIVDatingOnline, ChristianSafeHaven,  AidsDate, and HerpesinMouth . An investigation into the site's privacy policy and terms of service began in 2011 when three individuals who posted their profiles on PositiveSingles noticed their profiles showed up on more than 50 dating websites without their permission or knowledge, according to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. Many of the sites featuring the user's profiles were marketed toward different demographics than those mentioned in the user's profiles. BBC reports that the plaintiff who filed the suit acknowledged that after completing the site's registration page, a link to its terms of service was provided which did state that information about STD statuses may be shared with other sites. However, the plaintiff suggested that few members ever read the fine print and Daily News reports that SuccessfulMatch used this loophole to publicize the personal information of users with infections, such as HIV, herpes and syphilis by making them available to almost anyone after funneling the information to SuccessfulMatch.

"To borrow a line from the song that provided the soundtrack to England’s 2018 World Cup bid presentation, it was looking like a beautiful day on that December morning in Zurich four years ago. There was a fresh layer of snow beneath the feet of Lord Coe and London Mayor Boris Johnson as they went for a pre-dawn run beside the lake. Having already masterminded London’s successful bid for the 2012 Olympics, Coe probably felt much like he did in the same Swiss city where he had broken world records all those years earlier - quietly confident of victory. The night before, in the luxurious Baur Au Lac hotel where all the FIFA fat cats were staying, England’s bid ambassadors had moved from meeting to meeting with a swagger. David Beckham, Lord Coe and Andy Anson look dejected as England miss out on hosting the 2018 World Cup . Prince William, David Cameron and Beckham look confident ahead of the World Cup vote in 2010 . Beckham worked hard on behalf of the bid team to win support of Jack Warner . At one stage Prince William, David Cameron and David Beckham appeared together at the top of the main staircase, a formidable triumvirate all seemingly content that no stone had been left unturned ahead of the vote the next day. Even Jack Warner seemed to be on board, having been skilfully seduced. Beckham spoke gushingly of their good friend ‘Jack’. It appeared they would be getting the vote of the CONCACAF chief and quite possibly those of his acolytes on the FIFA executive committee. There was a sense that England had nailed it, unlike the Russians, their main rivals to host the 2018 tournament. The Russians’ eve-of-vote press conference had seemed limp, apathetic even. ‘They’ve thrown in the towel,’ remarked one observer. Either that or they didn’t need to make much of an effort. FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced Russia as the 2018 hosts as England's bid CEO Anson looks dejected . By the end of the final presentations, there seemed little to suggest England were not in a strong position to follow the capture of the Olympics by securing the right to host the greatest show of all. The presentation and the video, complete with that Elbow soundtrack, was terrific, so superior to anything else on offer. FIFA even rated England the best technical bid. And then came the vote, and the crushing sense that England had been humiliated. English faces turned grey in that auditorium. FA officials felt nauseous. How could they have been so naive to think they had a chance? Naive to think this was a game that could be won using the tactics they had employed. They had won two votes, one of which belonged to their own Geoff Thompson. The Prime Minister couldn’t get back to the business of running the country fast enough. There might have been a whiff of corruption even before the votes were cast but on Thursday Hans-Joachim Eckert’s report claimed England may not have played strictly by the rules either. FIFA Vice-President Warner (left) had promised to vote for England - but reneged on his vote . The FA fiercely refuted this in a strongly worded statement, but Eckert was scathing about their attempts to secure the support of the disgraced Warner. Eckert accuses England of ‘damning the integrity of the bidding process and the image of FIFA’ in chasing Warner’s vote. He reported the England bid team ‘often accommodated Mr Warner’s wishes in apparent violation of bidding rules and the FIFA code of ethics’. Among the alleged transgressions was the help they provided to a ‘person of interest to him (Warner)’ in finding ‘a part-time job in the UK’. England were also said to have provided ‘substantial assistance’ in setting up an Under 20 training camp for the Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation in the UK in response to Warner’s ‘improper demands’. The truth is, the England bid team were reluctant amateurs in a highly professional game, and if they were taken to the cleaners in Zurich they were tucked up again by FIFA yesterday. Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov and Alexei Sorokin of the Russia 2018 bid celebrate winning . Pursuing Warner in quite the manner they did was a mistake. It felt unpalatable at the time and the FA were left looking all the more uncomfortable when Warner was eventually exposed and bounced out of football for good. Everyone knew, even then, that Warner was corrupt, and the FA were foolish to associate with him. To think Prince William and the Prime Minister listened to Warner promising his support, only for him to then renege on his vote. Warner made mugs of them. The fact that public money — more than 10 per cent of the £21million spent on England’s bid — went towards trying to get Warner onside is a further source of embarrassment. Hans-Joachim Eckert (right, with Michael Garcia left) was critical of England's bid in his report . VIDEO Qatar cleared for World Cup as FIFA findings revealed . The FA were essentially punished for being more transparent than anyone else. The Russians ‘lost’ their emails. The Spanish just wouldn’t co-operate. And Qatar? Well, it’s just not easy to prove corruption, claimed the report. It is amazing that Eckert attacks England for a £35,000 sponsorship but goes much easier on Qatar for a similar one that cost them £1.15million. It was, as Damian Collins MP said quite rightly, a whitewash, a joke, and one that became all the more ridiculous once investigator Michael Garcia appealed to overturn Eckert’s summary of his report. Qatar's Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani poses with the famous World Cup trophy . Even by FIFA standards, that was a game changer, a day when the world governing body descended into chaos. While the credibility of FIFA has never been under greater scrutiny, the FA do not come out of this unscathed. Andy Anson and his bid team might have felt it necessary to court men such as Warner, but in doing so some of the most prominent people in the country were dragged into a tawdry affair and today it looks all the more embarrassing: an error of judgment.","England's team believed they had done everything to win the World Cup bid .

"Concern: David Hanson, Labour's immigration spokesman, says the Government needs to 'enforce the rules' in relation to sham marriages . One sham marriage may be happening in the UK every single hour, shocking figures revealed last night. Official figures show that between January and October last year, a total of 7,606 fake weddings were reported to the Home Office. Yet despite the huge scale of the problem, just 90 people were deported over the same period for engaging in false marriages to gain entry to the UK. It means that for every 85 sham marriages, just one person is being thrown out of the country. Experts said the appalling record sent out the unmistakeable signal to criminals that there will be no comeback if people enter a false partnership. Labour said the figures showed the Coalition was ‘presiding over a broken immigration system’. The party’s immigration spokesman, David Hanson, said: ‘This record speaks for itself. More sham marriages and fewer deportations. ‘People want the rules to be enforced, and these figures show the Government simply isn’t doing that. ‘The Tories are stopping half the number of people at our borders, fewer people are being deported, fewer foreign criminals are leaving and fewer employers are being fined for employing illegal workers. 'The gap between David Cameron and Theresa May’s rhetoric and reality is stark.’ Shocking: Official figures show that between January and October last year, a total of 7,606 fake weddings were reported to the Home Office. Yet despite the huge scale of the problem, just 90 people were deported . Last year one of the country’s most senior registrars warned that, in urban areas, one in five civil marriages may be ‘suspicious’. Mark Rimmer, chairman of the Local Registration Services Association, estimated that up to 15,000 of the 173,000 civil weddings each year in England and Wales could be fake unions designed to evade immigration laws. The latest figures, revealed by the Home Office for the first time following a Parliamentary question from Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, show that the problem may indeed be as stark has he warned. Senior figures: The latest figures were revealed by the Home Office for the first time following a Parliamentary question from Keith Vaz MP (left). Last year, Mark Rimmer (right), chairman of the Local Registration Services Association, warned that up to 15,000 of the 173,000 civil weddings each year in the UK could be fake unions . They show all the reports to the authorities about suspected sham marriages, and will therefore only be the tip of the iceberg. In 2013, up to the end of October, some 1,824 suspicious marriages and civil partnerships were reported to the Home Office by registrars. Extrapolated over the full year, this indicates there are will be around 2,189 cases - almost eight times the total in 2006. Delene Alouane, of Immigration Marriage Fraud UK, said that as well as . people being paid to marry, rising numbers of Brits were falling in love . - only to be duped by foreigners. She said there were growing . numbers of men tying the knot with Thais, Filipinos or Malaysians who . then cite domestic violence as a reason for divorce. And she . added a string of British women were falling for men from countries such . Tunisia, Morocco and the Gambia, who walk out the moment they get . residency. In addition, the Coalition has brought in a scheme where members of the public can log reports of sham marriages. In the last three months of 2012, 984 such reports were received, while between January and October 2013 there were 5,782 reports. Together with the reports from registrars, this adds up to 7,606 cases in the first ten months of 2013 - around one every single hour. The figures indicate that reports have soared by more than half between 2012 and 2013. David Green, chief executive of the think tank Civitas, said: ‘I find it very surprising that the numbers of deportations are so low as this has been a big issue for a number of years. ‘If the word gets out that you can get away with sham marriages in England, then you’ll get more sham marriages. And this send out the signal that, if you get found out, very little will happen.’ He added: ‘What is needed is willpower, pure political will. But the government is squeamish about seeming to be racist. ‘A lot of politics these days is not about problem-solving but is about reputation management. If they think it looks bad they don’t do anything.’ Last night a spokesman for the Home .

"In the year that has seen the likes of Liam Neeson, Tom Cruise and Sean Penn all reveal their toned torsos, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of male patients in their fifties and sixties seeking cosmetic treatment in order to achieve a more defined, muscular physique at a later stage in life. One such man is 54-year-old Donovan Nelson, who has undergone laser liposuction and pec implants to keep up with his 33-year-old wife. Donovan from Braintree, Essex, was once in very good . shape – exercising regularly and eating healthily – but nevertheless he . struggled to maintain a body that was toned and muscular through . exercise alone. Honed to perfection: 54-year-old Donovan underwent a new type of lipo called VASER so that he could keep up with his 33-year-old girlfriend . In his younger days Donovan, who owns his own marketing company, was better able to achieve . the results he wanted but after starting a family and living a busy . working life, he struggled to maintain a lifestyle that was active . enough to give him the body he wanted. Donovan’s wife Anna is also 21 years . his junior and so the pressure to look fit and in shape alongside her . was even larger because of this age gap. In the end he resorted to a treatment called VASER high def . at The Private Clinic, performed by Dr Mike Comins. The treatment was . carried out under local anaesthetic and involved melting away the . unwanted fat and removing it via a tiny canula. Maintenance: Donovan struggled to maintain a lifestyle that was active enough to give him the body he wanted alongside his younger wife . Dr Comins targets the . underlying fat during the procedure and suctions it out around the . musculature to create a more defined, finished result. Speaking to MailOnline, Donovan said: 'You can only go so far with exercise and at my age it's much harder to keep the weight off. 'I do a lot of cardio but it's hard to shift the fat in certain areas, especially after a certain age. 'The good thing about this treatment is it's targeted weight loss off the area you want to lose it from. I had love handles and fat below my pecs and I wanted to get rid of it.' He underwent the treatment six months ago and it set him back £10,000 but he maintains that it was worth every penny. Before and after: The candid photographs show the before (L) and after (R) effects of the £10,000 treatment . He said: 'Now I feel so much more confident and I love walking around without my top on. 'I like to go to Ibiza every summer for a few days and dance with my top . off  - being over 50 it's hard to dance around with your top off unless . you're in good shape. 'I would say to other men, try and get in shape through exercise first, . but if that doesn't work then perhaps surgery is a better option. Also, . the amount it costs is a good incentive to keep it off.' Staying in shape: Donovan maintains his great shape with Muy Thai boxing and weight training 4-5 times each week . He said: 'I do get told I look very young for my . age. I once got stopped at passport control as the officer didn't . believe it was me, because of my age.' He also had a pec implant a few years ago and is keen to have more treatment on his lower abdomen next as he wants more definition there. And it seems that Donovan isn't alone in his quest for more definition. The number of men above the age of 50 who have undergone the non-surgical alternative to liposuction at The Private Clinic of Harley Street has increased by more than 110 per cent in the past two years. Now, almost 20 per cent of the total number of men who undergo VASER at the clinic are above the age of 50. Confidence: He says he feels so much more confident with his new shape and loves taking his shirt off in Ibiza . Experts have put this increase down to a more open attitude to cosmetic surgery amongst men, together with the presence of older males in the public eye - from heads of industry and politicians to actors and musicians - who are today being photographed looking fit and well later in life. Dr Mike Comins, cosmetic doctor at The Private Clinic, who has performed more VASER treatments than any other practitioner in the UK, said: 'Some four-five years ago the average age of a patient who came to me expressing an interest in VASER was around 30 years old. At that time it was incredibly rare for men in their 50s and 60s to seek the treatment. 'Now a considerable proportion of the males I treat are 50 or older, which demonstrates a dramatic change in attitude towards cosmetic treatment. Not alone: Donovan isn't alone is his quest for greater abs, the Private Clinic have been a 110 per cent surge in men seeking the treatment . 'There are a number of reasons I would attribute to the rise in numbers. A lot of the men I treat have exercised regularly and maintained a healthy diet their whole lives in order to remain in shape. 'When these men reach their mid fifties and their metabolism begins to slow, they struggle to maintain that physique but they are not prepared to give up the body that they desire. 'I’m also increasingly aware that captains of industry are taking a much greater interest in their general health, fitness and physical appearance. 'The image of a senior male figure in business today is very different to what it was some 10-15 years ago. Trim and toned: With age, Donovan, who owns his own marketing company, couldn't maintain his physique so this was perfect for him . 'Gone are the days where men can afford not to care about the way they look and their physical health and fitness. Now these men are in the public eye and they care a great deal about looking and feeling fit and healthy beyond the age of fifty. 'For these individuals, treatments like VASER can go hand in hand with regular exercise, to help ensure that they look and feel fitter and younger. 'VASER is also far more suitable for these patients than traditional liposuction because it involves very little downtime, allowing the patient to get back to their day to day working routine almost immediately.'

"'I'm from a part of Holland which historically speaking probably shouldn't be Dutch at all. 'My home town of Maastricht - in a corner of the Netherlands near where it borders Belgium and Germany - strikes me as being much more Belgian in character than Dutch, in that fun-loving, hedonistic and unrestrained. 'Throughout history, lots of countries have fought to take possession of Maastricht. The French King Louis XIV always seemed to be sending his army to seize it. It was very important to him. Master musician: Dutch composer Andre Rieu may travel the world, but he insists he prefers Maastricht . Andre's home town may be in the Netherlands, but it borders Belgium and Germany. Pictured: the Meuse River . 'One of the town's claims to fame is that the real-life musketeer D'Artagnan - the hero of Alexandre Dumas's book The Three Musketeers - died fighting for the French in a siege of Maastricht and there is a statue of him in Aldenhof Park. 'The statue carries the Musketeers' famous motto: 'All for one, one for all.' That's a philosophy I like - democratic. 'According to legend, D'Artagnan ate his last breakfast in the kitchen of the castle in Maastricht where I live. One of Maastricht's must-see attractions is the statue of real-life musketeer D'Artagnan in Aldenhof Park . 'It is often said that Maastricht people have a Burgundy way of life: we like to drink wine, eat good food and relax. 'We also are a very cosmopolitan bunch. In addition to Dutch, we all speak French and German, and as there is a university here, English is also widely spoken. 'People are always surprised when I tell them that Belgium lies just 200 yards from my house and that this is the most northern part of the Continent where French is spoken. 'As founder of the Johann Strauss Orchestra, my love of the waltz is well known. But my passion for it really stems from the music rather than the city of Vienna, which I visited relatively late in life. 'My introduction to the waltz came when a cafe orchestra needed a replacement violinist and asked me if I was interested in joining. I went to the rehearsal and that was the very first time I played a waltz - it was the Gold and Silver by Franz Lehar. I'm going to Sao Paulo soon, and I'm going to play that waltz again. Andre has played in Vienna, but reveals that he did not first visit the musical city until later in life . 'The waltzes by Lehar are warmer than those by Johann Strauss. Strauss was more intellectual - by that, I mean he was a genius. Like most of his great musical contemporaries, he was universally admired - Johannes Brahms, for example, said he would have given anything to have written the Blue Danube. 'For me, Strauss is the composer of the waltz. I've composed some waltzes myself, but it's difficult to make them as good as his. 'The Austrians are not keen on being described as a reincarnation of Strauss. We were once performing in Tokyo, and a few of us were in the hotel bar having a drink. In the same bar were musicians from the Vienna Philharmonic. We were talking and drinking, and after several beers one of them said: ‘It’s not possible that you can play a waltz as it should be played because only we Austrians can play the waltz!’ 'I think that’s nonsense because I’m a musician. Even if I were an Eskimo, it would make no difference. When you’re a good musician, you are able to play any kind of music. 'When I finally went to Austria, I performed my first waltz in the wonderful Wiener Musikverein in Vienna. Afterwards, I heard there was a riot in the city because they wanted to know who allowed me to play there. However, I now go back to Vienna every year – it has become a tradition. One of Andre's biggest professional accomplishments? Playing New York City's Radio City Music Hall . Centre stage: He also fondly remembers the thrill of taking the stage at London's Royal Albert Hall . 'People are often warning me about the perils of playing in certain places. For example, someone once said: Watch out when you play in New York, the audiences are spoilt.’ But when I actually perform in these cities, the audiences are all so warmhearted and they want to enjoy themselves. 'My greatest performing thrill was probably when I first took the stage at London’s Royal Albert Hall – anybody who is anybody has played there. And I’ll never forget the joy of playing at New York’s Radio City Music Hall or the Musikverein. I’ve been very fortunate. One place I haven’t played but would love to is on the Moon. Sir Richard Branson tells me he is going to build a hotel there and has asked if I want to be the first to play in it. All in the family: Andre's father began his career as a conductor of the Leipzig Opera in East Germany . 'Music runs in my family. My father, Andre senior, was a conductor of the Leipzig Opera in East Germany, before working in Maastricht with the Limburg Symphony Orchestra. Once he dressed the whole orchestra in Mozart costumes and had them driven through the town in a horsedrawn carriage. I was so impressed. I think I have probably inherited a little bit of his crazy gene. 'I travel for my work, so for pleasure I like to stay at home. My wife and I do, however, spend a couple of days each year at the Belgian coast with the grandchildren. If we decide to venture further afield, we like to go to Rome or Venice. 'I adore Venice so much that my new show is titled Love In Venice. Love and Venice go together so well. 'I adore Venice so much that my new show is titled Love in Venice,' he says . 'I haven’t yet performed there, but some of my favourite concerts have been elsewhere in Italy. I did a TV special in Cortona, a wonderful old town in Tuscany. It was fantastic. I don’t really have any appetite for luxurious holidays. I’ve been to Monte Carlo three times – two of those occasions were to receive the World Music Award – but I have to say I’m always glad to return to Maastricht. I’m famous and I sell a lot of records, but home is where my heart is. 'I keep busy when I’m at home. Like most of the Netherlands, Maastricht is a great place to cycle, although I’ll never exhaust myself climbing its hills. The highest point in the town is 1,300 ft above sea level, prompting some to jokingly call it the Dutch Alps. 'I’ve discovered on my travels that an awful lot of people don’t really know very much about my country. I can go to America and people will say to me: ‘Holland? Is that in Denmark?’ They don’t know where it is. 'I tell everybody that I live in a beautiful country, because I really do love it. I’ve travelled the whole world and I’m very glad I live in Holland. Each summer, Maastricht hosts an open-air concert in the main square with crowds of up to 12,000 each night . 'One of the highlights of my year is the annual summer open-air concert in the main square in Maastricht. This year, for our tenth anniversary, we played eight shows. Every night we were performing to 12,000 people. It’s great for Maastricht because the hotels and restaurants do such good business. 'And in the run-up to Christmas, our big concert series takes place in the UK and Ireland. This year there will be shows in Belfast, Dublin, Nottingham, Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle, Birmingham, London, Manchester and Glasgow. I’m shortly launching a campaign to encourage everybody to learn how to waltz. Anyone who has been to my concerts knows that people love to get up and waltz in the aisles. 'Perhaps at this year’s concerts there will be even more people joining in – they’re a great way to get into the Christmas spirit.' For more information go to holland.com.

"David Cameron today admitted he will have to apologise to the Queen again for claiming she 'purred' when Scots rejected independence. He also revealed he 'contemplated' having to quit as Prime Minister if people in Scotland had voted Yes. In an interview he said he watched the results of the historic referendum with his son Ewen on his lap wearing tartan pyjamas, feeling 'saddened' about the prospect of separation. Prime Minister David Cameron today admitted that he will have to apologise to the Queen (left, pictured today outside Crathie Kirk in Aberdeenshire) again for revealing details of his conversations over the Scotland result . Mr Cameron was left red-faced after being caught on camera revealing details of his conversations with the Queen. On a visit to New York last week, the PM was filmed boasting to former mayor Michael Bloomberg about the call he made to the Queen at Balmoral. As the Prime Minister and Mr Bloomberg arrived for a press photo-opportunity, Mr Cameron smiled broadly as he recalled how he was able to tell the Queen it was 'all right' after the referendum resulted in a victory for the No camp. 'The definition of relief, if you are Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is ringing up Her Majesty the Queen and saying 'Your Majesty, it is all right, it's okay',' Mr Cameron said. 'That was something. She purred down the line.' Today Mr Cameron vowed 'never again' to discuss his conversations with the Queen after being challenged whether he was ashamed to have been overheard saying she had 'purred' when told the result of the Scottish independence referendum. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: '(It is) one of those moments when you look back and kick yourself very hard. 'It was not a conversation I should have had, I am extremely sorry and very embarrassed about it. 'I have made my apologies and I think I'll probably be making some more.' In an extraordinary sequence, David Cameron was today heard talking about the moment he rang the Queen at Balmoral to give her the news about the vote . Despite being just feet from the cameras, Mr Cameron appears to have had no qualms about being so indiscreet about his private discussions with the head of state . In the video recording, David Cameron can clearly be heard discussing his private conversations with the Queen. He said: . 'The definition of relief is being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and ringing the Queen and saying 'It's alright, it's okay'. That was something.... 'She purred down the line... 'But it should never have been that close. 'It wasn't in the end, but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt… . 'I've said I want to find these polling companies and I want to sue them for my stomach ulcers because of what they put me through. 'It was very nervous moments.' Asked if he felt ashamed, the Prime Minister added: 'I'm very sorry about it... I'm not going to ever discuss my conversations with the Palace ever again.' Downing Street has already contacted Buckingham Palace to offer the Prime Minister's apologies and it is understood that Mr Cameron will say sorry in person when he next meets Her Majesty for one of his regular audiences. After a bitter two-year campaign, 55 per cent of people in Scotland voted to remain part of the United Kingdom. It mean that First Minister Alex Salmond resigned, announcing hours after the result was declared that he would be stepping down in November. In the run-up to the vote Mr Cameron repeatedly denied he would not resign if voters backed independence, insisting they should not use the result as a chance to 'give the effing Tories a kick'. However, in an interview on the eve of the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Mr Cameron revealed he did have doubts about whether he could remain in office if he was the PM who oversaw the break-up of the UK. He told the Sun on Sunday, said he would have been 'heartbroken' by the break-up of the UK and first considered his position when polls put the Yes campaign ahead just days before the referendum. The extraordinary remarks were picked up as Mr Cameron went on a walkabout at the Bloomberg headquarters in New York, with the city's former mayor Michael Bloomberg . Mr Cameron also vowed to 'sue' polling companies who suggested the Yes campaign was ahead in the referendum campaign, claiming the worry had given him 'stomach ulcers' Mr Cameron said: 'I thought about resigning because I care so passionately about this issue. If the vote had been for Scotland to have left the UK, I genuinely would have been heartbroken. I would have felt winded and wounded. 'Emotionally, one would have thought, 'I'm so saddened by this. I find it difficult to go on'.' 'Of course, I contemplated having to go. I thought, 'What's the right thing to do?' In many ways the easiest thing would be to say, 'I feel wounded by this' and walk away. I'm sure it would have been absolutely awful. 'In the end I came to the conclusion that would not have been the right thing to do. Since the referendum he has faced calls to honour pledges for more devolution to Scotland and also consider allowing only English MPs to vote on English legislation.","Prime Minister heard making indiscreet comments about the head of state .

"A desolate urban ghost town, it is hard to believe that these streets belong to Accrington, formerly a major hub of the north's cotton and textile industry. With rows and rows of boarded up terraced housing, anyone unfamiliar with the area would be forgiven for mistaking the wasteland site as a scene of war or natural disaster. This is Woodnook, an area of Accrington with a less than sparkling reputation, which would've once housed a bustling community of factory workers and their families. But although the scene looks bleak now, these streets could soon be thronged with families again as a £10million project to revive the area that will eventually see 200 of these homes given a makeover has started. Wasteland: A boy kicks a football around in a scene that looks like something out of television soap Coronation Street, but these homes currently stand empty . Vacant: Lancashire in general has the highest proportion of vacant homes according to a recent survey, with just over seven per cent of Hyndburn homes currently empty . Desolate: Rows and rows of terraced housing in Accrington, Lancashire, stands desolate after the Government pulled the plug on a redevlopment scheme. But the area looks set to be given a new lease of life thanks to private investement . Bleak: A lone woman walks through the empty streets of Woodnook, Accrington. Developers hope that these streets will soon be bustling with a project underway to create four-bedroomed homes fit for the 21st century family . Gone: Dozens of children's hand prints adorn a wall in Accrington. The Woodnook area was once home to hundreds of families but now stands empty . Isolated: Around 25 per cent of homeowners were left isolated n the Woodnook area when the Government pulled the plug on the Pathfinder Housing Market Renewal Scheme . According to Hyndburn Council deputy . leader Clare Pritchard, the Woodnook area was left in limbo when the . coalition Government came into power in 2010 and dropped the Pathfinder . Housing Market Renewal Scheme. By the time the project was dropped, . plans were afoot to demolish and redevelop much of the area, with . around 75 per cent of residents having already moved out. She said: 'The . problem here is not a lack of housing, it's that we have the wrong kind . of housing. We found that there's no call for 'two up, two down' housing anymore. 'We're . an old mill town and many of these homes were built before 1900, . they're not energy efficient and it's too cramped for a family living . there. 'When the Government . dropped the HMR scheme the area had around 25 per cent occupancy, we . were unable to buy the remaining residents out and they were unable to . sell because who would want to buy a house in an empty area.' But Woodnook is one of the lucky areas. Depressing: A lone man walks down an alley separating two rows of terraces in Woodnook, Lancashire. There is no longer a demand for 'two-up, two-down' houses like these according to local councillor Clare Pritchard . Glimmer of hope: Private firm PlaceFirst has stepped in and offered Hyndburn Council money to complete a £10million regeneration scheme of these streets . Deluge: Rain pours down the walls of empty former council houses  in the Lancashire town of Accrington as it waits to be modernised by private developers . Uprooted: 75 per cent of residents had left the area before plans to flatten these Woodnook homes and regenerate the area ground to a halt, they are now completely empty . A private company, Place First, . stepped in and fresh £10million plans to give the area a new lease of . life are being put into action this week. Five . ghost town streets are to be spruced up with traditional terraced homes . knocked through to create four-bedroomed homes fit for 21st century . families in time for the beginning of 2014. Eventually 200 homes will be given a 21st century revival. Ms . Pritchard said: 'The homes will be below market rental price so we hope . to mix up the community. We want to use this to really sell . Accrington.' Before the . industrial revolution, Accrington was thought of as a 'considerable . village'. But But a number of cotton and textile mills were built in the . town in the mid 18th century providing work for much of the town. The . industrial revolution saw a huge boom in population in the area and the . population increased by more than four times its size in 100 years . between 1811 and 1911. Deserted: The area looks more like the scene of a war or a natural disaster with the majority of windows and doors boarded up and the remainder broken . Good value: The new houses in Woodnook are to be rented for lower than market value and councillors hope it will 'mix up' the population . Revival: Eventually 200 homes are to be given a complete revamp in Accrington . While much of the country, . particularly London and the south, struggles to solve the lack of . housing for burgeoning populations with many London boroughs desperately . taking to moving some council residents out of the city and further . north due to a lack of space, Accrington belongs to Lancashire - the . county with the highest proportion of vacant houses, according to a . recent survey.

"Basketball star Dwight Howard is under criminal investigation for child abuse in Georgia following allegations that he beat his six-year-old son with a belt buckle, according to reports. Law enforcement sources have revealed that the Houston Rockets center admits he hit son Braylon with a belt, but insisted that he did not know it was wrong because he was hit as a child, TMZ reported. The website previously stated that the Department of Children and Families (DCF) in Florida determined there was not enough evidence of child abuse to go forward with the case. Basketball star Dwight Howard is under criminal investigation for child abuse in Georgia, according to reports . But since the incident occurred in Georgia, police from the state asked Florida for the file. A Georgia law enforcement source reportedly told TMZ that 'people who were not so forthcoming before today [Monday] have been'. The source added that detectives conducted a number of one-on-one interviews and said that the case 'has now been raised to top of the list'. The case concerns allegations put forward by Braylon's mother, Royce Reed, who reportedly filed a complaint saying Howard had whipped their son with a belt, leaving the boy with bruises and abrasions. On Monday, TMZ Sports quoted from documents obtained from the DCF summarizing the findings of the doctor who examined the boy. The case comes two weeks after NFL star Adrian Peterson, 29, pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault for disciplining his son . The doctor  reportedly discovered injuries 'consistent with Braylon being struck with the buckle end of the belt' and 'consistent with a medical diagnosis of physical abuse'. The documents allegedly state: 'Dr Kesler noted Braylon to have a linear bruise and patterned abrasions consistent with the history given by Braylon of being struck with a belt numerous times by his father.' Howard's attorney told TMZ that Reed is 'shopping her baseless allegations' to Georgia authorities, even though Florida's Department of Children and Families found her claims had 'no merit'. His rep said: 'It is troubling to see a mother use her son as a pawn against his father,' and that Howard, 28, will do 'whatever is necessary to protect [the child's] welfare and best interests'. DCF found the allegations credible, according to TMZ, but concluded they did not meet the standard of proof required for formal action. Howard's attorney told TMZ that he is confident Georgia will reach the same conclusion as the Florida Department did because 'The truth is on our side'. The case comes just two weeks after NFL star Adrian Peterson, 29, pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault - down from a felony charge of child abuse - for disciplining his son with a wooden switch. The child, who has not been named, was left with cuts, marks and bruising to his thighs, back and one of his testicles, according to court records - and backlash from the public was strong. The Minnesota Vikings' star running back was spared jail, but has been suspended without pay for at least the remainder of 2014 season.","The boy's mother reportedly filed complaint saying Howard had whipped their six-year-old son with a belt, leaving bruises and abrasions .

"A mocked-up image of a plus-size Barbie beside a traditional Barbie has sparked a debate about the doll's impact on female body image. The Facebook group Plus Size Modeling shared the powerful post a week ago, with the question: 'Should toy companies start making plus-sized Barbie dolls? In all honesty, we want to know...' Since then, it has generated nearly 36,000 likes and over 1,600 shares - as well as mostly negative comments from many who felt the plus-size Barbie was an inaccurate representation of curvy women. Plus-size... or obese? A mocked-up image of a plus-size Barbie beside a traditional Barbie by Worth100 has sparked a debate about the doll's impact on female body image . One user, Kyle Boise, wrote: 'Yeah lets promote poor health and eating habits. Just what America needs.' And Lindsay Keg-leg Kahlig commented: '[The] average [dress] size these days is 14-16.

Melissa Audet added: 'I hope she comes with a blood pressure . cuff to show young girls that how many chins she has is not what's . important but the health issues that could come along with being this . size.' Indeed, the doll's chins, in particular, sparked ridicule.

What's . important is the health issues that could come along with being this . size' The dominant opinion, though, was that that there should be a middle ground. Rather than promoting an exaggerated  'obese' Barbie, young girls should have a healthy-looking doll that is neither too fat nor too thin. 'Why not have a realistically proportioned Barbie that promotes healthy diet and exercise?' Michelle Ashford suggested, while Bec Bailey wrote: 'Not plus size but definitely healthy weight.

"She's famous for her conservative sense of style but that didn't stop the Duchess of Cambridge from plumping for an unusually bright hue for her first day on Australian soil. Paying tribute to her Australian hosts, the Duchess' sunny £900 dress mirrored the gold of the Australian flag and was created by the London-based Serbian designer, Roksanda Ilincic. But while the dress drew appreciative gasps from the waiting crowd, it seems not everyone was a fan of the bold ensemble. 'William said I look like a banana,' Kate confided to one well-wisher, Heather Easton, as the couple arrived at Sydney's iconic Royal Opera House. Scroll down for video . Bright arrival: The Duchess of Cambridge steps off the Air Force jet in yellow, carrying Prince George, alongside the Duke . Although the Ryedale wool-crepe dress failed to find favour with Prince William, the dress, which comes from the London-based Serbian fashion designer's S/S 2014 collection, did win the Duchess the approval of the fashion crowd. And it also proved a hit with well wishers, among them Mrs Easton, who enjoyed a friendly conversation with the Duchess from her perch in the disabled section, and another with the Duke. She . told William that she had seen him as a baby in New Zealand when he . took his first few steps at Government House, Wellington. And . she told him that she clearly remembered his mother and that she looked . more beautiful in real life than in her photographs, to which the Duke . replied: 'Thank you very much.' As . 32-year-old Kate first stepped off the plane in Sydney, she carried . Prince George - the real star of the show - in her arms as the family . made their way out of the aircraft to meet a line of waiting . dignitaries, including the prime minister Tony Abbott. Wake up: Kate peers down at a sleepy Prince George as she steps off the plane in her Roksanda Ilincic dress . Stunning: Kate admired her posy of flowers which were presented by Joscelyn Sweeney, 22, who has Down Syndrome, as she walked alongside the Duke and a squirming and grumpy looking Prince George . Standing among the soberly-dressed dignitaries, her yellow dress provided a welcome splash of colour - unsurprising as, according to Matches, a retailer that stocks the dress, it was inspired by the work of Brazilian artist Hélio Oiticica and incorporates his trademark bold block colours. While you can pick up the dress off the peg, it comes in white with flashes of yellow - the reverse of the Duchess' dress - which indicates that the piece was made specifically for the visit. But with its square neckline and neatly tailored shape, the piece is a classic that retailers such as the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite high street name Zara have found easy to emulate. It is not the first time the Duchess has worn yellow to a public occasion either. She previously wore a dustier shade of . the colour for her arrival at Calgary International Airport in . July 2011 as part of the Royal couple's Canadian tour.

Careful: William passes baby George back to his mother as her glossy hair is blown back in the wind . During that visit, she paired her dress with shiny nude heels and repeated the trick for Sydney. The family touched down in the city for their long-awaited trip at 2.25pm, with the doors to their plane opening at 2.35pm sharp, for their 10 day tour of Australia, the second leg of their three-week tour Down Under. Amongst the highlights of the trip are a visit to Uluru - Ayers Rock - watching life savers on Manly Bay and a visit to the world famous Taronga Zoo with George, where a Bilby Enclosure is being named after the little prince. The wife of the second-in-line to the British throne and mother of a future king, has looked immaculate throughout the Royal tour of New Zealand. On this showing, it seems her tour of Australia will prove just as stylish. Not in the mood? Kate encourages her son to get in the meet and greet mood but he looks far from interested .

"Older but better: American women say they are happiest in their fifties, like actress Jodi Foster . The ideal age for an American woman is 53 because they are happy to reap the benefits of being older while still acting as though they are in their thirties, experts say. A survey of 2,252 adults showed that on average the perfect age for females was 53 - a similar age to actresses Jodi Foster and Andie MacDowell. Experts say the reason behind the choice is that women in their fifties still act as though they are 35, dating younger men and becoming famous, despite being almost two decades older. Psychologist Barbara Becker Holstein told Today.com Health: 'We can act and feel at 50 now the way people used to at 35. 'You have almost every opportunity. 'You’re young enough to be famous or start an organic farm and still have the muscle tone to work eight hours a day. 'You’re old enough to have wisdom but young enough that your parents are still alive so you have a generational experience. 'If you’re tired, you can ask the young man on the bus to get out of his seat for you. 'Or you can date the young man. The more I think about it, the more appealing it is.' Participants of the Harris interactive poll were asked if they could stop time and live forever in good health at a particular age, what age that would be. Those aged 18 to 36 thought the perfect age was 38. Americans aged 37 to 48 wanted to stay put at 49, while those aged 49 to 67 decided on 55. Mature adults, aged 68 and older, were happy at 67. On average, men wanted to be younger than women, choosing 47 over the average perfect age for females of 53. Those with kids in the household said they would like to stay 45 forever, while those without children opted for 53. A similar survey conducted 10 . years ago found that most people thought 41 was the perfect age. Still got it: Andie MacDowell, 55, is proof that women can be fabulous in their fifties . Experts say the change is down to several reasons, including the influence of the . boomer generation and recent 'medical miracles.' Psychologist Barbara Becker Holstein said: 'If you’re lucky enough to have good health and money to . take care of yourself, why not incorporate the wisdom and maturity that . goes with age?' Holstein said all of the recent medical, and cosmetic, developments have also helped 50 become more appealing. She . added: ''For a woman, you can stay stylish and fit and maybe get your . hair dyed or just do a little [cosmetic] tune-up and feel, ""Wow, this is . great."" Fifty going on 35: Women have the wisdom that comes with age and are in good health, experts say . 'In terms of childbearing, you can basically say forget it or if you want a baby at 50 or 53, you can get your hormones juiced up and go for it.' Holstein said research shows people are more comfortable with themselves the older they get and that as we age, we tend to be less depressed, less anxious and more optimistic than our juniors. She added: 'It’s kind of a hiatus age. Lots of people don’t have grandchildren by 50 so you’re not necessarily tied down babysitting. 'Of course, given how slowly young people mature now, you may still be dealing with someone in their 20s who loves living at home.'","Harris interactive poll of 2,252 adults asked Americans their ideal age .

"A grandmother has died from rabies after being turned away from the same hospital twice. Sharanjit Ubhi, 58, was bitten by her son's pet dog when she was visiting him in India. The dog gave her the fatal disease and when she went to Darent Valley Hospital, Kent, two months later, complaining of pain in her right arm, she was turned away. Mrs Ubhi had not mentioned being bitten by a dog and her observations appeared 'normal' but when she developed hydrophobia the family's GP recognised the symptoms and sent her for specialist treatment. However, it was too late and she became the first person in the UK to die from rabies for seven years. Sharanjit Ubhi initially went to Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent, but she did not mention a dog bite and observations showed up 'normal' The inquest at St Pancras Coroners Court ruled Mrs Ubhi died of brain and heart failure as a result of rabies infection. Giving a verdict of accidental death, Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe said: 'This was not a natural cause of death. It is quite clear this death resulted from an untoward incident, namely an injury by a dog. 'Whilst in India in March 2012 Mrs Ubhi was playing with a puppy and sustained a minor injury to her arm. But despite maximum treatment she died on May 27th, 2012, as a result of an accidental injury.' The mortality rate of rabies is almost . 100 per cent if people who are bitten do not seek help within a few . weeks of the symptoms starting to show. The . viral infection is spread by infected animals to humans most commonly . by biting or scratching. It can also be spread by animal saliva coming . into contact with a graze or cut on a human’s skin. As well as other symptoms some victims also develop hydrophobia - a fear of water. There are about 55,000 cases of rabies worldwide, but half occur in India. The . last known case of rabies in England occurred in July 2005 when a woman . from Manchester died after contracting it from a dog bite in the Indian . resort of Goa. In 2002 . David McRae became the first person to die of the disease in Britain for . 100 years after being bitten on the hand by a rabid bat in Scotland. Since 1946, 24 people have died after being infected with rabies abroad. Four of these were since 2000. Speaking after the inquest Mrs Ubhi's son Gurpreet, 29, said: 'The stigma behind rabies is that it's a big, drooling dog with bloodshot eyes that bites you. 'But this wasn't. It was a puppy so small you could pick it up in the palm of your hand. My mum wasn't even bitten, it was a nick, and when she showed it me I had to squint to see it. 'It's a tragedy what's happened to our family, but if this can highlight to Brits travelling abroad the importance of being properly vaccinated maybe something good can come out of this.' Speaking at her inquest today, her family said that the bite was so small she did not think of getting herself checked out by a doctor at the time. It was only when she suffered three days of pain in her arm while at home in Dartford, Kent, that she sought help from doctors. She was put into isolation at University College Hospital, London, but died on May 27 this year. Gurpreet Ubhi, her son, told the inquest that the family was 'totally distraught'. He said: 'What happened was a tragedy. It was very rare. My mum was a strong person. This is probably the only thing that kept my mum down. Describing what happened he . said: 'It wasn’t a bite as such. It was actually a pup which was so . small she could hold it in the palm of her hand, not a big dog as has . been depicted. She was taken to University College Hospital, London, where she was treated in isolation but died as a result of rabies . 'She was playing around with it and there was a slight nick on her arm. It was so minute it didn’t even register to her to get it checked out.' Back in England Mr Ubhi said his mother seemed fine until a week-and-a-half before she got seriously ill. 'She said she had pain in her arm. In hindsight you think I could have done so much more but at the time we still didn’t think anything of it. I told her to take a paracetamol and go to bed and said in the morning you’ll be fine,' he said. But the next day Mrs Ubhi’s symptoms had got worse and she complained of a burning sensation in her arm. Her son said: 'That’s when she actually told me what had happened in India three months ago.' A spokesman for Darent Valley Hospital said: 'We offer our sincere condolences to the family and friends of this poor lady. The UK is rabies free. 'If a patient does present at hospital with vague symptoms a doctor is unlikely to consider rabies as a diagnosis unless the patient highlights animal contact in an at-risk country. The hospital responded to the information supplied by the patient at the time.'","Sharanjit Ubhi's bite was so small that she didn't think to get it looked at .
At hospital her observations were 'normal' and she didn't mention the bite ."
"According The Global Language Monitor the most commonly used word in 2013 was '404', which refers to a technical error code . The web has been a negative place over the past year.

"It was a vast boat that saved two of each animal and a handful of humans from a catastrophic flood. But a controlversial new theory claims that in fact, Noah's Ark was round - and made of reeds. a leading academic claims a recently deciphered 4,000-year-old tablet from ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) reveals the striking new details about the roots of the Old Testament tale of Noah. Irving Finkel, curator in charge of cuneiform clay tablets at the British Museum, poses with the 4000 year old clay tablet containing the story of the Ark and the flood, that claims the Ark was actually round . The text describes god speaking to Atram-Hasis, a Sumerian king who is the Noah figure in earlier versions of the ark story. He says: 'Wall, wall! Reed wall, reed wall! Atram-Hasis, pay heed to my advice, that you may live forever! Destroy your house, build a boat; despise possessions And save life! Draw out the boat that you will built with a circular design; Let its length and breadth be the same.' The ancient Babylonian text describes the ark as a round 220-ft diameter coracle with walls 20-ft high. According to the tablet, the ark had two levels and a roof on the top. The craft was divided into sections to divide the various animals into their own sections. The 60 lines of text, which Dr Finkel describes as a 'detailed construction manual for building an ark', claims the craft was built using ropes and reeds before being smeared with bitumen to make it waterproof. It tells a similar story, complete with detailed instructions for building a giant round vessel known as a coracle — as well as the key instruction that animals should enter 'two by two.' The tablet went on display at the British Museum today, and soon engineers will follow the ancient instructions to see whether the vessel could actually have sailed. It's also the subject of a new book, ""The Ark Before Noah,"" by Irving Finkel, the museum's assistant keeper of the Middle East and the man who translated the tablet. Finkel got hold of it a few years ago, when a man brought in a damaged tablet his father had acquired in the Middle East after World War II. It was light brown, about the size of a mobile phone and covered in the jagged cuneiform script of the ancient Mesopotamians. 'It was really a heart-stopping moment — the discovery that the boat was to be a round boat,' said Finkel, who sports a long gray beard, a ponytail and boundless enthusiasm for his subject. 'That was a real surprise.' New revelation: According to an ancient Babylonian tablet, Noah's Ark was a 220-ft wide coracle - the equivalent of six London buses - with walls 20-ft high . Finkel believes a round boat makes sense. Coracles were widely used as river taxis in ancient Iraq and are perfectly designed to bob along on raging floodwaters. 'It's a perfect thing,' Finkel said. 'It never sinks, it's light to carry.' Elizabeth Stone, an expert on the antiquities of ancient Mesopotamia at New York's Stony Brook University, said it made sense that ancient Mesopotamians would depict their mythological ark in that shape. The tablet records a Mesopotamian god's instructions for building a giant vessel, two-thirds the size of a soccer field in area, made of rope, reinforced with wooden ribs and coated in bitumen. Finkel said that on paper (or stone) the boat-building orders appear sound, but he doesn't yet know whether it would have floated. A television documentary due to be broadcast later this year will follow attempts to build the ark according to the ancient manual. The 4000 year old clay tablet containing the story of the Ark and the flood stands on display at the British Museum in London . The artefact was discovered in the Middle East by Leonard Simmons, who indulged his passion for history while serving in the RAF from 1945 to 1948. The relic was passed to his son Douglas, who took it to Dr Finkel to translate. The tablet went on display at the British Museum today, and soon engineers will follow the ancient instructions to see whether the vessel could actually have sailed . The flood story recurs in later Mesopotamian writings including the 'Epic of Gilgamesh.' These versions lack the technical instructions — cut out, Finkel believes, because they got in the way of the storytelling. 'It would be like a Bond movie where instead of having this great sexy red car that comes on, somebody starts to tell you about how many horsepower it's got and the pressure of the tires and the capacity of the boot (trunk),' he said. 'No one cares about that. They want the car chase.' 'Already in 1872 people were writing about it in a worried way — What does it mean that Holy Writ appears on this piece of Weetabix?"" he joked, referring to a cereal similar in shape to the tablet. Finkel said he has no doubts. Irving Finkel, curator in charge of cuneiform clay tablets at the British Museum, poses with the 4000 year old clay tablet containing the story of the Ark and the flood. 'I'm sure the story of the flood and a boat to rescue life is a Babylonian invention,' he said. He believes the tale was likely passed on to the Jews during their exile in Babylon in the 6th century B.C. And he doesn't think the tablet provides evidence the ark described in the Bible existed. He said it's more likely that a devastating real flood made its way into folk memory, and has remained there ever since. 'The idea that floods are caused by sin is happily still alive among us,' he added, pointing out a local councilor in England who made headlines recently for saying Britain's recent storms were caused by the legalization of gay marriage. 'Had I known it, it would have gone in the preface of the book,' Finkel said. Noah's Ark is typically portrayed at a traditional ship, such as in this Italian mid-16th century painting .","Dr Irving Finkel has translated cuneiform text on an 3,700-old clay tablet .

"England fans taunted their Scottish rivals with a series of chants poking fun at the result of the country's historic referendum, including one song informing them: 'You're British 'til you die'. The 5,000 English supporters who headed to Glasgow for the 3-1 England victory also lampooned outgoing First Minister Alex Salmond, who was in the stands and quit after losing the Yes Campaign, singing to him: 'We all voted yes'. For long periods they also belted out Rule Britannia and God Save The Queen over and over again as the Auld Enemy comfortably beat bitter rivals Scotland 3-1 at Parkhead in Glasgow. In the weeks before September's independence vote the outcome was on a knife-edge but in the end the No side won a decisive victory, with 55 per cent of the votes - and 85 per cent of the country voted. But the banter in the stands turned sour when a significant number of England fans also sang anti-IRA songs while the official Football Association band played the song 'Follow England Away', and an FA official was then sent to the stands to tell the band to  stop playing. Other supporters unfurled a 'No Surrender' flag - a phrase used in a well known song sometime heard at England games where some chant: 'No surrender, no surrender, no surrender to the IRA scum'. The singing will worry FA bosses, with England due to play a friendly with the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in June. Scroll down for video . Taunts: England fans sang songs teasing Scottish independence supporters last night during their team's 3-1, singing: 'You're British 'til you die' Another disappointment: Former First Minister Alex Salmond sang the Scottish national anthem before the international friendly match, which ended in a 3-1 win for England with two goals from Wayne Rooney . Grudge: Merchandise on sale prior to kick-off at Celtic Park Stadium, just two months after the United Kingdom could have been split up. Some said the half-and-half scarves should have been 55% - 45 % - a reference to the referendum . Glasgow tattoo: Patriotic Scotland fans, no doubt disappointed by the Referendum loss, would not have enjoyed seeing their team lose 3-1 to England . The match was being played in Scotland for the first time in 15 years but two goals from captain Wayne Rooney and a header by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was enough to beat Gordon Strachan's side. Up to 60,000  fans watched the friendly - the oldest fixture in international football. There was a heightened police presence around the stadium, stations and city centre but there were no reports of major fighting between rival fans before, during or after the game, which has been marred by violence in the past. The match itself passed without incident although seven people were arrested following a disturbance near a city centre . Police were called to the scene near the Thistle Hotel in Cambridge Street, Glasgow, at around 10.20pm. Supporters from both sides were arrested in connection with alleged breach of the peace offences. They are expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court today. During the match, tensions ran high amid reports of anti-IRA chanting by some fans. Each side booed the respective singing of their national anthems and England supporters were heard singing “f*** the IRA” during the match. Celtic Park was close to its 60,000 capacity for the much-anticipated game as the neighbours met on Scottish turf for the first time in 15 years. Upset: But other Three Lions fans started chanting 'f*** the IRA' - which led to an apology from the Football Association . Message: Other fans unfurled a 'No Surrender' banner - a phrase used in the song: 'No surrender to the IRA' A Scotland fan is dealt with by stewards after invading the pitch during the international friendly between England and Scotland . Scotland and England fans were separated by police and stewards during the match but there was no major trouble . Atmosphere: Football fans show their support by cheering for their team in the stands during the match, and this man had his short off on a cold night in Glasgow . Rivals: England fans heading to the stadium pictured before kick off - around 5,000 were in the ground to watch their side's win . Support: This topless England fan appears to be leading a chant or song from the stands during the match - the oldest fixture in international football . Football fans and police near St Enochs tonight - around 45 police officers kept watch and escorted a group to another pub . Police Scotland said they had not received any reports of offensive chants following the 3-1 victory to England. But in the first half, an FA official contacted the band to ask them to stop playing the tune for the chant. After the game England manager Roy Hodgson said he was unaware of the song but apologised for any offence on behalf of the FA. He said: “I was aware the crowd were tremendously supportive. I didn’t have a clue what they were chanting. “I don’t condone it. If anyone was offended, I’m sure the FA would like to apologise to them. “All we can do is play our football and be grateful for the support and hopefully they will behave themselves and not get themselves into a situation where their chanting is being criticised.” Euphoria: Adam Lallana (left) and Rooney roar with delight after the England captain's second goal of the night . Star striker: The England captain scored twice last night, with the final goal sparking an acrobatic back flip . The England team take part in a minute's applause in memory of Scotland fan Nathan McSeveney, who died on Friday . More than 200 people were arrested in 1999 when England took on Scotland at Hampden Park and police said ahead of the match that they were monitoring “known troublemakers” from both countries who they believed were planning to attend. Around 5,000 visiting fans celebrated after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave England the lead in the first half and Wayne Rooney went on to score twice. A goal from Scotland’s Andrew Robertson was not enough for Scotland to repeat their victory over the Republic of Ireland at Parkhead on Friday. Before the 8pm kick-off there was a minute’s applause for Scotland supporter Nathan McSeveney, who died at the match. Supporters had mixed views on whether Scotland v England - the oldest fixture in international football - should resume as an annual event. Tartan Army member David McCann said: “You can see from the build-up that it gets everyone interested and it makes a change from the usual boring friendly matches. “But if it was played every year, then I think they’d need to lower the ticket prices.” England supporter James Ward said: “I’m looking forward to it but I don’t think it should be (played) every year. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, and all that.” The sound of the national anthems was drowned out by boos at Celtic Park last night . England boss Roy Hodgson apologised on behalf of the fans who were chanting anti-IRA songs . The England supporters' band, pictured in Ukraine at Euro 2012, were told to stop playing by a FA official last night - tyhey say they knew nothing about the chants .","Scotland hosted England for the first time in 15 years last night in Glasgow's Celtic Park for a friendly match .

"Have you ever experienced deeply . pleasurable tingles that begin in the back of your head and spread down . throughout your body and limbs, triggered by certain sounds or physical . sensations? This . can be anything from getting a haircut, hearing a paint . brush against canvas, to listening to someone whisper. If you have, you are experiencing what is being referred to as ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response,  dubbed a 'braingasm' by those who experience it. Canadian film-maker Lindsay Ragone is exploring the phenomenon - and the enthusiastic community which has sprung up around it - in a new documentary, Braingasm. As sweets are unwrapped and paper clips arranged (common triggers, perhaps), voices tell us of what they feel when they hear their 'special sounds': 'I feel tingles going off from the top of my head, travelling down my spine.,' breathes one. Another adds: 'The brain orgasm... leaves you surprisingly relaxed and soothed.' Ragone is appealing for more stories to complete her documentary. Rhodri Marsden, one of the first to write about the ASMR in The Independent, says it is sparked off by 'expertise, precision, reassuring speech patterns and gentle sounds.' He says: 'I once saw a man talk for 10 minutes about the benefits of purchasing a pack of 10 blank video cassettes, and it left my head gently buzzing in a way that's hard to describe. The more gentle and redundant their explanations are, the more pleasure I get.' Rhodri is not alone. The recently-discovered phenomenon, like so many others, came to . light through the internet and now has its own dedicated fan-base, . research page and soon, the first scientific study looking into brain . patterns of people experiencing ASMR. A YouTube search for AMSR turns up . thousands of videos. Most commonly, they are young women, speaking in . soft, whispery monotones about nothing in particular.The most popular, by theWaterWhisperers, has so far has had almost 800,000 views. The ASMR Facebook page, which has 11,200 members, describes the phenomenon as 'a pleasant, often intense tingling sensation that begins in the head and travels down the body to varying extents.' 'It is often accompanied by a euphoric feeling, and can overwhelm the experiencer of a particularly strong ASMR event. Some ASMR experiencers are triggered from an uncontrolled external stimulus; other experiencers can control an ASMR event through conscious thought triggers.' Birds of a feather: ASMR proponent 'Heather Feather' brushes her hair for hours for the listening pleasure of the ASMR community . One particularly interminable one made by 'Heather Feather' begins with a breathy explanation of what the viewer is about to see: Heather Feather brushing her hair while it's wet. Then, she plans to dry the hair, and then brush her hair while it's dry - all for your aural pleasure. The video goes for more than an hour and has 32,604 views. Another, made by theWaterWhispers and called Let Me Take Care of You, features a young woman in a maternal/nursemaid role, caressing the camera, speaking softly to it, and assuring it that it's going to be OK, and dabbing its fevered brow with a washcloth. For 13 minutes. One might expect such videos to be the object of ridicule, but it's just the opposite - people seem to let down their guard and let a stranger's soft whispers or the sound of someone brushing their hair comfort them. Margaret Bennett commented on Let Me Take Care of You: 'Thank you very much for﻿ making this; couldn't seem to wind down till I found this, and now I'm all tingly and warm... time to crawl into bed and finally sleep. I'll definately [sic] be poking around on your channel.' berecca123 said, 'This is by far my favorite video! Please do another similar because I could probably recite this due to how many﻿ times I've watched it haha. I LOVE the wet towel and the tucking in. It made me feel so cozy :) thanks a lot Xxxx.' Comfort: Ilse at theWaterWhispers dabs her camera's hot forehead with a a damp washcloth in the immensely popular Let Me Take Care of You video . The owner of theWaterWhispers channel, who refers to herself as Ilse in her videos, is a Dutch ASMR enthusiast. She's made 211 videos, which include 'Saleswoman role play - shoe shopping', where she pretends to sell you a pair of shoes, 'Relaxing chocolate tasting' and another where she talks - whispers - the viewer through her grandmother's jewellery collection. It's hardly edge-of-your-seat stuff. But for the ASMR community, this stuff is like a drug. Sadah1986 wrote: 'I finally know I'm not the only one with tingly dealing if someone looks at thing or makes noises. I had it as a child an nobody understood... I finally know I'm not the only﻿ one.' Another commenter wrote that 11:40 was his favorite part of the jewellery video - featuring Ilse scraping her finger over an earring. In her videos she refers to herself as Ilse, but when she spoke to MPBN, she said her name was Maria. She said some of the subscribers to her videos include soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. 'And they share with me how much they struggle with their nightmares that they get,' she said. 'And the ASMR whisper videos, they actually help them fall asleep better, which is amazing because they sometimes say medications don't work, but these videos work instead.' There are also 'unintentional' ASMR videos - instructional videos such as someone demonstrating Japanese bookbinding, making origami or, as many ASMR experiencers say, the late Bob Ross, whose combination of softly spoken words and demonstrating technique seems to push a lot of ASMR buttons. Unintentional: It's unlikely the maker of this instructional video had any idea it would be a trigger for ASMR . It's unlikely that AMSR is a new phenomenon. YouTube, Twitter and Facebook have changed the way people communicate and share ideas and information - there's a forum for everything and our tendency to 'overshare' online has created diverse interest communities. AMSR is the same - it began in 2009, a Yahoo! group called the Society of Sensationalists formed  'in hopes of finding people who experience the same sensation.' In 2010 Andrew MacMuiris started a blog called The Unnamed Feeling, on which is a timeline of ASMR. That same year  Jenn Allen, who founded the site asmr-research.org site, and coined the term AMSR. After that point, the timeline becomes crowded with events, media attention and group meetings. In September 2012 an ASMR app was released for Apple iOS. So where to next for the mysterious ASMR and its devoted community? Well, a Reddit user and Dartmouth College undergrad Bryson Lochte announced earlier in the year that he plans to perform brain scans to study it for his thesis. Lochte said he planned to release his preliminary discoveries on ASMR in the next few months. We're tingling with anticipation.","New phenomenon identified as Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response .

"The intern at a leading investment bank who died after reportedly working punishingly long hours had modelled himself on Gordon Gekko, the ruthless trader in the film Wall Street. Moritz Erhardt, 21 – described by his parents as their ‘sunshine’ – had written in an online CV that he was driven to ‘be the best all the time’. The body of the German student was found in a shower at his East London flat last Thursday by friends. Friends of German student Moritz Erhardt, 21, (left) who died while employed as an intern at Bank of America Merill Lynch, said he modelled himself on Gordon Gekko (right), played by Michael Douglas in Wall Street . He had been nearing the end of a seven-week internship with the Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch Investment Bank Division. Friends claimed he worked an ‘all-nighter’ shift eight times in only two weeks. It is thought he had been trying to impress bosses and collapsed after having an epileptic fit or seizure. Yesterday his father Dr Hans-Georg Dieterle and mother Ulrike travelled to London from their home in the town of Staufen Im Breisgau, close to the German-Swiss border. Dr Dieterle, a psychoanalyst and personal life coach, issued a brief statement in which he said: ‘Moritz was our sunshine. His plan was to work really hard for a few years and to do something good afterwards.’ A former friend told how Mr Erhardt, who had recently completed a study abroad programme at the University of Michigan, had clearly been driven when at school in Germany. ‘A lot of the boys dreamed of being someone like Boris Becker or the footballer Michael Ballack, but Moritz always said he wanted to model himself on the Gordon Gekko character from Wall Street,’ said the friend, who did not want to be named. Mr Erhardt was near the end of his seven-week summer internship with Bank of America Merrill Lynch International in London when he died . Gekko, with his striped braces and slicked-back hair, became a symbol of Eighties greed. Michael Douglas, who played him, won the best actor Oscar for the 1987 film. As Mr Erhardt's parents arrived in London, a former secondary school teacher of their son spoke about how he had warned the conscientious student not to focus solely on work and money. Mr Erhardt's parents said he was their 'sunshine' and wanted to 'work really hard and do something good afterwards' Winfried Sturm, 68, a physics teacher at the Faust Gymnasium school, who was named Germany's Teacher of the Year in 2004, is quoted in The Times saying that Erhardt gave everything 100 per cent; 'he was incredibly single-minded,' he said. The teacher, who beat cancer in his 40s, brought on he believes by the self-induced pressure to succeed, went on to say: 'I gave him some guidance for a happy and healthy life: if you are always working to make money, and you have no other time, it is not good.' In an online CV Mr Erhardt said he had a ‘persistent aspiration’ to succeed and had been ‘highly competitive and ambitious’ from early on. He wrote that at school he played soccer, tennis, athletics and skiing, adding: ‘Sometimes, I had a tendency to be over ambitious, which resulted in severe injuries. 'With respect to my performance in school, I was striving for excellence and trying to be the best all the time.’ Mr Erhardt had been staying in student accommodation in Bethnal Green. Another student said: ‘Apparently he pulled eight all-nighters in two weeks. They get you working crazy hours and maybe it was just too much for him.’ On the wallstreetoasis.com website, which revealed his death but did not name him, one poster called LH Dan wrote: ‘There’s a lot of pressure which leads you to not always make the best decisions ... You’re trying your hardest to prove yourself worthy of a full-time offer and it can be easy to neglect your health and sanity.’ Merrill Lynch has allegedly told staff not to talk about Mr Erhardt’s work patterns or death but one fellow intern said: ‘You would not find a harder worker. He seemed a lovely guy and was tipped for greatness.’","Friend of Moritz Erhardt said he modelled himself on Michael Douglas character rather than sports stars like Boris Becker or Michael Ballack .

"Scotland vs England. It wasn’t bad was it? Passion, atmosphere, goals, we really should do this again soon. Same time next year?

Look what it meant to the players; when was the last time Wayne Rooney celebrated a goal as he did on Tuesday night? Wayne Rooney and Adam Lallana encapsulate what it means to beat Scotland as an England player . Rooney netting his second of the evening takes him to within three of Sir Bobby Charlton's England record . And we shouldn’t forget the fans. The atmosphere inside Celtic Park was pulsating. The response on social media was emphatic, too. Not to mention the eight million or so who tuned in to ITV’s coverage. So, why was last night’s game only the second meeting between the two old enemies in 15 years? We should be making this an annual get-together. Why play a meaningless friendly against Norway in front of a half-empty, half-interested Wembley crowd, when we could have a repeat of what happened at Celtic Park. Get a trophy in place – it would give England and Scotland a real chance of actually winning something – and name it after the two nation’s finest players. How about the Moore-Dalglish Shield or the Charlton-Law Vase? Let’s alternate venues, too. Wembley next year, and then back up north for the following campaign.

Scotland supporters arriving at Glasgow station ahead of their side's match against the Auld Enemy . Those from footballing yesteryear will remember the two nations clashing every year. The Home International Championships saw England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland battle it out annually. But with crowd trouble on the rise, a piled fixture list, lack of interest in the matches – notably bar England vs Scotland – and the Three Lions citing a desire to play against ‘stronger’ teams, the tournament was canned in 1984 after 100 long years. Although attempts were made to revive the competition in 2011, albeit without England, the re-branded tournament flopped and was discontinued over poor attendances. Scotland supporters invaded the Wembley pitch in 1977 and sat on the crossbar before digging up the turf . But that shouldn’t put England and Scotland off staging an annual fixture. This is the fixture which really matters, and the evidence was on show last night. The fans behaved themselves, too. The FA and SFA should get their heads together and make it happen annually. Every November, under the lights, two teams battling it out to be the best in Britain. What’s not to love? With the Premier League and Champions League taking centre stage, this could be the best way to revive all of our flagging interests in the international game.","England's win over Scotland was a brilliant advert for international football .

"The mid-20th Century animosity against Germany appears to be long forgotten, as the nation has been voted the world's favourite country. The U.S. lost the top spot to Germany for the first time in six years, as people from 20 countries were asked to rank others in categories such as Governance, Culture and People. Angela Merkel and the people of Germany may have their football team to thank for their win, as the polling took place in July this year, days after they won the World Cup. Winner: Germany has been voted the world's favourite country out of 50 top developed nations . People around the world now have more positive perceptions of Germany than of 49 other developed and developing countries, according to the annual Anholt-GfK Roper Nation Brands Index (NBI). 'Germany appears to have benefited not only from the sports prowess it displayed on the world stage at the FIFA World Cup championship, but also by solidifying its perceived leadership in Europe through a robust economy and steady political stewardship,' said Simon Anholt, an independent policy advisor. 'Germany’s score gains in the areas of ""honest and competent government"", ""investment climate"", and ""social equality"" are among the largest it achieved across all the aspects covered by the NBI 2014 survey.' The U.S. has come out on top every year since 2009, but this year lost out to Germany following military interventions across the globe. Happy Merkel: Germany made the top spot after improving their rank on areas such as 'honest and competent government', 'investment climate', and 'social equality' While it still is seen as number one in several areas, including creativity, contemporary culture, and educational institutions, its role in global peace and security only ranks 19th out of 50 nations. 1. Germany . 2. United States . 3. United Kingdom . 4. France . 5. Canada . 6. Japan . 7. Italy . 8. Switzerland . 9. Australia . 10. Sweden . 'In a year of various international confrontations, the United States has lost significant ground where tension has been felt the most acutely,' Xiaoyan Zhao, Senior Vice President and Director of Nation Brands Index SM at GfK, said. 'Both Russia and Egypt have downgraded the U.S. in an unprecedented manner, particularly in their perception of American commitment to global peace and security, and in their assessment of the competence of the U.S. government.' However, on a global level, Russia that has received the strongest criticism from public opinion, and dropped several spots. For the past ten years, Anholt and GfK have together been measuring the image of  50 countries on23 attributes, separated into six overall categories;  Exports, Governance, Culture, People, Tourism and Immigration/Investment. For the 2014 study, a total of 20,125 interviews were conducted in 20 countries, with at least 1,000 interviews per country .","Germany voted world's favourite nation in annual poll .

"The Premier League remains the most attractive football division in the world for global footballing talent, with more than 100 stars of the 2014 World Cup finals making a living at the 20 top-flight clubs. Although Spain is widely - and rightly - seen as the destination of choice for a few handfuls of the very biggest names including Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Neymar and James Rodriguez, it is not so much La Liga as a whole that is the draw than its two biggest clubs, Real Madrid and Barcelona. Spain as a whole is home to only 50 players on show at last year's World Cup, whereas the Premier League leads the way with 112 such players, ahead of Serie A (with 81) and Germany’s Bundesliga (75). Manchester United midfielder Angel di Maria was the Premier League's most expensive player in 2014 . Premier League star Wayne Rooney (left) is another big name, as is Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez (right) The ‘stardust factor’ is one of a range of measurements MailSport has considered as part of the most in-depth comparative study of the world’s football leagues. Big names from most of the World Cup’s leading contenders make their home in the Premier League, from German World Cup winners Mesut Ozil, Andre Schurrle, and Lukas Podolski to Argentinean World Cup finalists Sergio Aguero, Angel Di Maria and Pablo Zabaleta. Oscar, Willian and Ramires are just three of the Brazilian semi-final squad playing in England, all at hot title favourites Chelsea. Robin Van Persie and Daley Blind are among the Dutch team who also reached the last four to ply their trade in England’s elite. Seasoned international players from Cameroon to Croatia, from Chile to Spain and all points in between make their livings in club locations as diverse as Everton and Hull, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United. Luis Suarez topped the bill as the biggest signing after Barcelona forked out £75million for the striker . Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Paul Pogba (right) play in Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A respectively . The top divisions of Italy and Bundesliga are also global melting pots, albeit not on the scale of the Premier League while Spain and France are less attractive as a whole. ‘Smaller’ leagues providing dozens of players to the World Cup include the Russian Premier League (34), Turkey’s Super League (26), Liga MX in Mexico (26) and MLS (24). Another measure of each’s league’s ‘pulling power’ is their clubs’ ability to spend large sums on transfer fees to help lure big names. In this respect, La Liga - or rather the big two clubs there - led the way in 2014, with Barca buying Suarez for around £75m being La Liga’s biggest buy. The Premier League’s biggest buy was £59.7m Di Maria to United, whereas the biggest buys in Italy and Germany were both ‘only’ around the £20m mark, Roma buying Juan Iturbe for £17.2m and Bayern Munich buying Mehdi Benatia for £20.4m. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is arguably the most glitzy player in France's Ligue 1, which came fifth in the study . Only four other leagues in the world had any top-price 2014 purchase at £10m or more: PSG in France bought David Luiz for £50m, Zenit of Russia bought Javi Garcia for £13m, Santos of Brazil bought Leandro Damiao for £10.2m, and Leeds of the Championship - included as a division in its own right - bought Ross McCormack for a fee that could rise to £11m. In most leagues in the world, even the richest clubs can pay top prices of other single-digit millions or less for players. Some league spend little or even nothing on transfers, as happened in Colombia and Nigeria this year. The finances of the Premier League underpin an ability to attract big names - and that is one reason for England’s top level having the most World Cup stars working there.","Exclusive Sportsmail study shows the English top flight has most talent .

"Fox News television panelist Eric Bolling asked if a female fighter pilot may be called 'boobs on the ground,' in a joke that viewers have condemned as sexist. Bolling made the remark in the Wednesday broadcast of 'The Five' during a segment on Maj. Mariam Al Mansouri, who launched bombs against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Panelist Kimberly Guilfoyle's segment praised Mansouri for her efforts. 'Hey ISIS, you were bombed by a woman,' Guilfoyle said.

'I hope that hurt extra bad from you because in some Arab countries, women can't even drive. Her nickname, per Jennifer Griffin? ""Lady Liberty,"" baby.' Guilfoyle's co-panelist Greg Gutfield then remarked 'Problem is, after she bombed it she couldn't park it.' Upset, Guilfoyle was heard saying 'Now did you really have to ruin my -' Andrea Tantaro, the other female panelist on 'The Five,' said 'Oh...' and left her mouth agape. 'I salute her,' Gutfield maintained. Eric Bolling then asked 'Would that be considered boobs on the ground, or no?' With her hand over her face, Guilfoyle said 'Oh my God.

'But at that time, the doors were not open for females to be pilots, so I had to wait almost ten years.' Al Mansouri also said that 'Whenever a woman enters a new male-dominated field, they find the same hesitation, the same prejudice, the same stereotype thinking.

"The Premier League is to be investigated by Ofcom under the Competition Act after concerns were raised about how it sells broadcast rights for live football. The Office of Communications, the government approved regulator for the broadcast industry, has intervened after a complaint made by Virgin Media in September. The investigation could lead to a major shake-up in how much live football is shown on TV. Virgin Media want more than the current 41 per cent of live matches sold to TV, claiming the present situation leads to higher subscription costs for consumers. Virgin Media have complained about the way the Premier League sells its broadcast rights . Football fans in the UK pay more than anywhere in Europe to watch live top-flight games on television . Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore has been praised for bringing in lucrative TV deals . Ofcom have promised to consult the Football Supporters' Federation and other supporters' groups. The screening of live football on TV is a sensitive issue and there are concerns that it could affect attendance and atmosphere at stadiums on match days, particularly for 3pm kick-offs. BSkyB and BT currently share the rights to televise Premier League football games. The price for the latest rights deal - covering 2013-16 - is a staggering £3bn, a 71 per cent increase on the last agreement. This investigation, which will begin immediately, is likely to delay the bidding process for the next set of rights from 2016 onwards. A Premier League statement said: 'We note that Ofcom has launched an inquiry. Jamie Carragher (centre) and Gary Neville (right) work on Sky Sports' popular Monday Night Football show . 'Ofcom has stated that this is at an early stage and it has not reached a view as to whether there is sufficient evidence of any infringement. 'The Premier League currently sells its audio-visual rights in a way that is compatible with UK and EU competition law and will continue to do so. 'We will be able to demonstrate that as part of this process.' Virgin Media's specific complaint is that the current arrangement 'for the collective selling of live UK television rights by the Premier League for matches played by its member clubs is in breach of competition law.' Ofcom are now investigating the Premier League, which could lead to more games being shown live . Sir Richard Branson is a shareholder in Virgin Media, who have complained about the way TV rights are sold . The company, which Sir Richard Branson is a shareholder in, has raised concerns about the number of Premier League matches for which live broadcasting rights are made available. 'Virgin Media argues that the proportion of matches made available for live television broadcast under the current Premier League rights deals - at 41% - is lower than some other leading European leagues, where more matches are available for live television broadcast,' said Ofcom in a statement. In their initial complaint to Ofcom, Virgin Media highlighted the fact that UK fans pay the highest prices in Europe to watch football on TV. They pointed out the disparity of the fact fans in the UK have to pay £51 monthly for access to all top-flight matches on TV, while it is £21 in Germany, £18 in Spain and as little as £10 in France.","Ofcom's intervention could mean more live football is shown on TV .

"Premier League attendance levels last season were the highest in England's top division for 64 years, and more people attend Premier League games each season than in any league in the world, at almost 14 million. As MailSport’s groundbreaking study of the world's major leagues shows, only Germany's Bundesliga can top the Premier League in any measure of turnstile success - fans attending per game. The Bundesliga's figure of 42,609 fans per game is the biggest average in world football and the second biggest average in global professional sport - after American’s NFL. Scroll down for a FULL list of average attendances per game last season . The Premier League averaged 36,695 fans per game last season to be the second best attended football league per game by some margin ahead of La Liga in third (26,955 fans per game), then Italy’s Serie A (23,385), with Mexico's LigaMX (22,271) pushing France's Ligue 1 (21,155) out of the top five. The Dutch Eredivisie and MLS in the USA and Canada are the seventh and eighth best attended leagues with more than 19,000 fans per game each. In terms of total fans through the turnstiles, the Premier League, with 20 teams and 380 matches had 13.94 million fans coming through the turnstiles last season, or almost a million more than in the Bundesliga, where the 18 teams played 306 games. With an average fan attendance of 42,609 the Bundesliga boasts the highest amount in world football .

"Astronomers have spotted a turbulent planet, 25,000 light-years away, that is four times as massive as Uranus. The exoplanet is part of a double-star system known as OGLE-2008-BLG-092L around 19 times farther away from its parent star – the same distance as Uranus and the sun. The alien Uranus may help scientists explain solve the mystery about the origins of the ice giants in our solar system. Astronomers have spotted a turbulent planet, 25,000 light-years away, that is four times as massive as Uranus (pictured). The exoplanet is part of a double-star system known as OGLE-2008-BLG-092L around 19 times farther away from its parent star – the same distance as Uranus and the sun . Astronomers have discovered hundreds of planets around the Milky Way, including rocky planets similar to Earth and gas planets similar to Jupiter. But there is a third type of planet in our solar system - part gas, part ice - and this is the first time anyone has spotted a twin for our so-called 'ice giant' planets, Uranus and Neptune. While Uranus and Neptune are mostly composed of hydrogen and helium, they both contain significant amounts of methane ice, which gives them their bluish appearance. Given that the newly discovered planet is so far away, astronomers can't tell anything about its composition, but its distance from its star suggests that it's an ice giant . The astronomers spotted the planet due to a phenomenon called gravitational microlensing—when the gravity of a star focuses the light from a more distant star and magnifies it like a lens. The light curve of the OGLE-2008-BLG-092 microlensing event is pictured . Pictured are storms on Uranus captured August 5 . Huge storms have been erupting on Uranus – and they are so enormous they can be easily seen using telescopes on Earth. The swirling clouds and violent winds are being driven by massive bands of jet streams that can surround the entire planet. Astronomers in Hawaii said they were 'surprised' by the bright storms they observed this week, including one that they described as 'monstrous'. Uranus boasts a thick atmosphere with winds blowing at 560 mph (900 km/h). It has massive storms that could engulf continents on Earth, and temperatures in the -220°C (-360°F) range. Scientists believe the planet's strange tilt is the reason behind this bizarre weather system. The Earth has seasons because the axis tilts, and the hemisphere tilted towards the sun gets more light than that the region tilted away. But Uranus has an axis that runs almost parallel to the plane. This causes 21-year-long seasons and unusual cold weather. The newly discovered planet leads a turbulent existence: it orbits one star in a binary star system, with the other star close enough to disturb the planet's orbit. The discovery was made by an international team led by Radek Poleski, a researcher at Ohio State University. 'Nobody knows for sure why Uranus and Neptune are located on the outskirts of our solar system, when our models suggest that they should have formed closer to the sun,' said Professor Andrew Gould at Ohio University. 'One idea is that they did form much closer, but were jostled around by Jupiter and Saturn and knocked farther out.' 'Maybe the existence of this Uranus-like planet is connected to interference from the second star,' he added. 'Maybe you need some kind of jostling to make planets like Uranus and Neptune.' The binary star system lies in our Milky Way galaxy, in the direction of Sagittarius. The first star is about two thirds as massive as our sun, and the second star is about one sixth as massive. The astronomers spotted the planet due to a phenomenon called gravitational microlensing—when the gravity of a star focuses the light from a more distant star and magnifies it like a lens. Very rarely, the signature of a planet orbiting the lens star appears within that magnified light signal. In this case, there were two separate microlensing events, one in 2008 that revealed the main star and suggested the presence of the planet, and one in 2010 that confirmed the presence of the planet and revealed the second star. 'We were lucky to see the signal from the planet, its host star, and the companion star,' said Professor Poleski. 'If the orientation had been different, we would have seen only the planet, and we probably would have called it a free-floating planet,' he added. Both observations were done with the 4.2ft (1.3 metre) Warsaw Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile as part of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. 'Nobody knows for sure why Uranus and Neptune are located on the outskirts of our solar system, when our models suggest that they should have formed closer to the sun,' said Professor Andrew Gould at Ohio University.

Terrified, fearing she was going to die, . the 32-year-old shop assistant from Poland was paralysed until her . sister Beata screamed at her to jump the 16 feet to the street below. In shock: Monika Konczyk was pictured jumping for her life after fire tore through her first floor flat in Croydon . Caught in the arms of a man lined up under her window, she escaped unharmed. She told last night how she thought she was going to die in her rented flat in the conservation area of central Croydon on Monday night. The Daily Mirror reported that she told a friend: 'It was horrendous. I was trapped inside my flat with nowhere to go. There was no way out for me. I thought I was going to die. I thought I would burn to death. 'The flat was getting hotter and hotter and when I tried to escape out of the front door the heat was just too much. 'I was panicking. All I could do was put my head out the window and people saw me down in the street below.' Despite her escape, her family said she has become withdrawn and depressed. Miss Konczyk had watched all the . violence on the television and her older sister had phoned to tell her . not to go out. So she got changed into her pyjamas and got ready for bed. But at 9pm hooded youngsters broke into the House of Reeves furniture store, which backs onto her flat, and set it alight. Ready to launch: Miss Konczyk had to throw herself from her burning flat . Safety: She was caught by police below, and is unharmed but very shaken . The store quickly turned into an inferno, endangering nearby residents with flames and smoke. Miss Konczyk ran to the window and started shouting for help, just as her sister and husband arrived. She . told her friend: 'People started gathering and shouting at me to jump. But my English is not great. I've not been here for very long. Trauma: Miss Konczyk is said to be so shocked by her experience that she doesn't want to go outside . 'Then . a Polish man who lives in the area started speaking to me and . eventually I was persuaded that I had to do it. I had to jump.' Locals ignored police orders . to stay back and defied thick smoke and heat to reach Miss Konczyk. They laid out cushions and carpet rolls to soften her fall in case police didn't catch her. As onlookers yelled 'jump, jump', she reportedly slid down an awning before jumping into the arms of a man waiting below. It is unclear if she was caught by riot police or a Romanian man named Adrian, who told the Daily Mirror she was weeping with shock when he caught her. He added: 'We are neighbours. Nobody is a hero.' Her sister (Mrs) Beata Mecaj 37, said last night: ‘She is incredibly traumatised as she feels she narrowly escaped death. ‘She is staying with me at the moment and I’m looking after her. ‘It will take a while for her to get over this. ‘She only came to the UK a few months ago and we are appalled that something like this could happen here. ‘We always thought this country was so civilised.’ Miss Konczyk had come to the UK in March to learn English and to join her older sister, who has lived in the UK for five years. She had recently started a relationship with Amar Sharabi, a business graduate from India. He said yesterday: ‘Monika is absolutely traumatised and very stressed. She doesn’t want to even leave the house.’ A friend, Aleksandra Robak, said Miss Konczyk ‘didn’t want to jump, she thought she was going to die'. She added: ‘She was terrified and screaming at her sister that all of her things were in her flat and she didn’t want to leave them. ‘She was also very scared of jumping but Beata told her it’s better to jump than to die. ‘She is going to the doctors because we think she is suffering from depression. ‘Poor Monika has been very quiet since Monday and is not herself – she is still very shaken and upset.’ Miss Konczyk, who is from the Polish town of Koronowo, has not returned to her job at Poundland in the Whitgift centre, where she works with her sister.","Monika Konczyk, 32, is 'absolutely traumatised' by her experience .

"Teenagers who adopt a daily cannabis habit before the age of 17 are 60 per cent less likely to finish secondary school or university, compared to peers who have not used the drug, researchers claim. The study also found that regular teenage cannabis users are seven times more likely to attempt suicide and eight times much more likely to use other drugs. Experts behind the Australian study hope that their research will be taken into account when considering whether it is a good idea to legalise the drug. Scroll down for video . Teenagers who adopt a daily cannabis habit before the age of 17 are 60 per cent less likely to finish secondary school or university, compared to peers who have not used the drug, researchers claim . ‘Our findings are particularly timely given that several US states and countries in Latin America have made moves to decriminalise or legalise cannabis, raising the possibility that the drug might become more accessible to young people,’ said Richard Mattick, professor of drug and alcohol studies at the University of New South Wales, Australia. Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug across the world and recent statistics have shown that adolescents in some countries are starting to smoke it at an increasingly young age, with some using the drug daily. In England, four per cent of 11 to 15-year-olds report using cannabis in the past month, while roughly seven per cent of US high-school seniors are daily cannabis users. In Australia, around one per cent of 14 to 19-year-olds use cannabis daily, with four percent smoking the drug weekly. The study, published in The Lancet Psychiatry suggests that regular teenage cannabis users have an 18 times greater chance of becoming dependent on the drug in later life. As well asdamaging their chances of finishing school and university (illustrated with a stock picture) the study also found that regular teenage cannabis users are seven times more likely to attempt suicide and eight times much more likely to use other drugs . Researchers combined data on up to 3,765 participants who used cannabis from three large, long-running longitudinal studies to find out more about the link between the frequency of cannabis use before the age of 17 years and seven developmental outcomes up to the age of 30. These outcomes included completing high school, obtaining a university degree, cannabis dependence, use of other illicit drugs, suicide attempt, depression, and welfare dependence. They found clear links between frequency of cannabis use during adolescence and ‘young adult outcomes’ after taking into account factors such as sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. According to the study’s lead author, Dr Edmund Silins, ‘Our results provide strong evidence that the prevention or delay of cannabis use is likely to have broad health and social benefits. ‘Efforts to reform cannabis legislation should be carefully assessed to ensure they reduce adolescent cannabis use and prevent potentially adverse effects on adolescent development.’ In England, 4 per cent of 11 to 15 year olds report using cannabis in the past month, while roughly seven per cent of US high-school seniors are daily cannabis users. A stock image of a cannabis plant is pictured . Women are more likely to suffer negative effects of smoking cannabis - including depression, anxiety and paranoia - because their oestrogen levels make them more sensitive to its active ingredient, according to recent research. US researchers found that female rats were at least 30 per cent more sensitive than males to the pain-relieving qualities of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in cannabis, because of their increased oestrogen levels. Experts said that the increased concentration of THC in today’s cannabis meant smokers are more likely to experience negative effects including anxiety, confusion, panic attacks, hallucinations or extreme paranoia, with women more at risk than men. Previous studies have shown that women are more prone to cannabis abuse and dependence than men. In women, cannabis withdrawal symptoms including irritability, sleep disruption and decreased food intake were shown to be more severe. Women were also more likely to relapse when trying to quit smoking the drug. The only effect of THC which appears to be more pronounced in men is in terms of appetite. Studies in California found that THC stimulated the appetites of male animals more than those of females, meaning the ‘munchie effect’ might be stronger for men than women.","Study by University of New South Wales, Australia found that regular teenage cannabis users are seven times more likely to attempt suicide .

"A crackdown on the rich and famous who own mansions through offshore companies is on course to raise five times more than expected. Pop stars, actors and jetsetters were able to avoid paying stamp duty when they bought and sold multi-million pound properties by selling it as part of a ‘company’ based abroad. A move to close the loophole had been expected to raise £20million this year, but it is now set to net the Treasury £100million. Two years ago it emerged that every home in Cornwall Terrace in North London had been transferred to a company on the Isle of Man . Anyone using a scheme which places properties in an offshore firm face an annual tax of between £15,000 and £140,000 on mansions worth more than £2million. Failure to tell the HM Revenue and Customs about a scheme would also incur a £1,000 fine. At the Budget last year the Treasury said it would raise £20million in the first year from April but by December it had already netted £92million. By the end of the financial year in March it is expected to have topped £100million. Danny Alexander, Lib Dem Chief Secretary . to the Treasury, told MailOnline: ‘A vital part of building a stronger . economy and a fairer society is to make sure that everyone pays their . taxes. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said it was 'wholly unfair' that wealthy homeowners were avoiding paying tax . ‘It was wholly unfair that wealthy owners of large houses in the UK could avoid paying tax by arranging the ownership of the property through an off shore company. ‘One of the Liberal Democrat priorities in the coalition is to deal with such loopholes which were left un-tackled by the last Labour Government. ‘This tax avoidance measure has been dramatically successful, raising £92 Million, over 5 times the initial forecast.  This result shows the strength of our resolve to repair our tax system and make it fair for all.’ Around 5,000 people are thought to own properties through British and offshore companies, a practice which offers tax advantages as well as anonymity. Two years ago it emerged that in exclusive Cornwall Terrace in North London, where the average asking price was £35 million, every single home has been transferred to a company on the Isle of Man. Transferring ownership of a property to an off-shore company means that when it comes to be sold the buyer purchases the company as a whole, assuming de-facto ownership of the property. Because the deal is classed as a corporate transaction as opposed to a property sale there are no stamp duty obligations involved. This means that while a family buying a home costing £400,000 would pay £12,000 to the Government, a multi-millionaire buying a luxury pad could pay nothing. The savings involved can be vast. Someone who purchases a £50million property though an off-shore company would avoid paying the treasury £2.5million.","Treasury moved to close loophole used by wealthy to avoid stamp duty .

"Teenagers Arin Andrews and Katie Hill look like any normal young couple posing in their swimwear. It is hard to believe that just two years ago Arin was a girl called Emerald, and Katie was a boy called Luke. Arin, 17, and Katie, 19, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, have both undergone surgeries to change their gender and now are enjoying being in their bodies they always wished for. Scroll down for video . Young and in love: Transgender teens Arin Andrews, 17, seen posing for a picture with sweetheart Katie Hill, 19, at the Oologah Lake in Tulsa, Oklahoma . Living life to the fullest: The teenage couple have been bullied and lost friends but have been able to support each other through their gender treatment . Just over a year ago Katie, a university student, had gender reassignment surgery, thanks to an amazing $35,000 donation from an anonymous donor who read her story in a local newspaper. Now, Arin, who is still at school, has undergone an operation to remove both of his breasts, and is proudly showing off his new male physique. For the last year, Arin has been binding up his chest to try to hide his female body, but can now go topless for the first time after his surgery in Cleveland, Ohio, in June. He said: 'Now I can wear a tank top, which I couldn't before, I can go swimming shirtless, I can walk outside, I can just be a regular guy now. 'I hated my breasts, I always felt like they didn't belong - now I can finally be comfortable in my own body.' He added: 'Now when I'm out in a public pool, or lifting weights, no-one raises an eyebrow, they just think I'm a guy - just a skinny dude in the gym trying to build some muscle. Enjoying life: The teenagers say that they are now both comfortable in their own bodies . Defining themselves: Last year Katie had a $35,000 sex change surgery to turn her into a woman - and now Arin has followed his dream to have a flat, male chest following an operation . 'My family have really surprised me with how supportive they have been throughout the surgery. I'm so lucky to have them and Katie to rely on.' Katie and Arin met nearly two years ago at a support group for transgender teenagers and bonded through their shared experiences. Katie said: 'To me, Arin's just my Arin, he's always looked manly to me. But now he's had the surgery he's much more confident and comfortable with himself.' But now that the teens' physical appearance matches their gender, both of them are excited to be able to go swimming, boating and sunbathe like other couples. Katie added: 'Being transgender myself, I understand Arin probably better than anybody else, how good he feels and how complete he feels.' True love: The couple have been able to rely on each other through their transformation . Happy and healthy: Arin and Katie pose in their swimwear at the lake and later looking casual at home . Light at the end of the tunnel: The couple were both bullied and lost friends who could not cope with their changes . In the future, Arin might consider having genital surgery, but this can be complicated, and for now he's delighted with his new body. Both the couple's families are supportive of their relationship and say the way the way the teenagers have supported each other has helped in their transition. Arin's mum Denise Andrews said: 'Seeing Katie go through her surgery was helpful to Arin. 'It was being around it and seeing her getting to transform. And being a couple at the time was I think just the cherry on the cake. Changed lives: Emerald Andrews, before she became Arin, at the age of five in Tulsa, Oklahoma (left) and Luke Hill (right), before he became Katie, aged seven . 'Every transgender person would love to have the transformation physically because it just completes them as a person.' The last two years have been very difficult for the teenagers. Katie was bullied at school, and Arin had to change to a different high school when he revealed he was transgender, and has lost friends in the process. 'I lost one of my best friends through the transition,' said Arin. 'We used to go on vacations together and were like sisters. Making a splash: The couple met at a group that supports transgender teens . 'But I got the chance to open her eyes and show her I'm still a good person. I'm still the person I was, I just look different. 'She was gone for a while but then she came back. 'It taught me that the people who really love you need some time, but they'll always come back around.' Happy: Arin had an operation to remove his breasts and is proud of his new physique . After he began dressing as a boy, Arin also lost a new male friend who learned about his past as a girl. 'He said: ''I pictured you as a girl, and I can't do it anymore,''' said Arin, adding: 'You can't just force people to be your friends.' Katie started her degree course at an Oklahoma university last autumn but has struggled to make new friends because of prejudices against transgender people in the traditional Southern State. She said: 'I had quite a lot of friends in college that were really close to me and then all of a sudden they just stopped talking to me. 'I think what happened is they found out I was trans through a story or word of mouth and they decided that was too much for them.' The last two years have also been difficult for the teenager's families as they've come to terms with losing their son and daughter, and also some of their own friends. Arin's mum Denise said: 'There are still a group of people we don't interact with any more. I know that they questioned me as a parent, they're not comfortable with it.' But she added: 'A lot of people worry about losing the gender of their child. But as you look through albums and realise your babies are growing up, we also watched them grow up and turn into somebody different. 'Whether they stay the same gender or not, they become independent.' Now their outward transformation is complete, the teenagers hope people will accept them as their new genders, and their difficulties will become a thing of the past.

"It was one of the most astonishing battles in the animal world - when a snake decided it was going to swallow a whole crocodile for lunch. If it seems an impossible notion, these photos show the astonishing result as the snake slithered slowly away with the crocodile filling its body. Local woman Tiffany Corlis saw the snake, a python, heading towards the freshwater crocodile on the edge of Lake Moondarra, some 12 miles north east of Mount Isa, in outback Queensland, reported the ABC. Scroll down for video . The python wrestle the six-foot freshwater crocodile at Lake Moondarra, 12 miles north east of Mount Isa, in outback Queensland . With lightning speed it suddenly wrapped itself around the crocodile and put it in a death squeeze. No matter how much the crocodile struggled, it had no hope of freeing itself from the snake’s powerful body. It wasn’t long before life was squeezed out of the croc. Wisely deciding not to intervene, Ms Corlis quietly took photographs of the rare event as the snake turned to the object of the attack and began slowly consuming the reptile. That seemingly impossible task took a little more time but eventually the entire crocodile disappeared through the python’s mouth. Then, twice its normal size, the snake slowly made its way into the nearby swamp bushes to digest its hearty meal. Try as it might, once the crocodile was caught in the python's death grip, it could not fight its way free . Once the snake had killed the crocodile, it proceeded to swallow it whole .

"A cruise ship which made headlines when a pensioner was killed by a freak wave ran aground with almost 1,000 mainly British tourists on board, in sight of the pier where it was to be moored. And it's not the first occasion the ship has come into difficulties in Norwegian waters, with it also getting stranded back in March this year. The 22,000 tonne MS Marco Polo was manoeuvring to drop anchor in high winds near Leknes in Norway's northern Lofoten Islands when it became lodged in soft mud, British owner Cruise & Maritime Voyages (CMV) said. Scroll down for video . A handout photo released by the Royal Norwegian Air Force and taken from a rescue helicopter shows a Norwegian coast guard vessel in front of Bahamas-registered cruise liner Marco Polo . The ship hit the headlines in February when James Swinstead, 85, was killed and several other people were injured when water crashed through restaurant windows as storms hit the English Channel. The 85 year old died 'almost instantly' after water rushed on board as it was battered by waves during severe storms. The 22,000-tonne vessel, operated by Cruise and Maritime Voyages (CMV), was heading for its home port of Tilbury in Essex at the end of a 42-night voyage when the incident happened on Valentine's Day. Water crashed through a window, injuring a number of the 735 passengers, who were mainly British. A female passenger in her 70s was airlifted off the ship, while 14 people were treated for minor injuries. Mr Swinstead, a father-of-two from Colchester, Essex, was on the cruise with his wife Helen, 82. The ship hit the headlines in February when James Swinstead, 85, was killed (pictured here with wife Helen) and several other people were injured when water crashed through restaurant windows . This time around, Marco Polo was chartered by Britain-based Cruise & Maritime Voyages and was cruising along Norway's fjords when it ran aground. The ship is currently on a 14-night voyage to Norway and the Land of the Northern Lights with 763 passengers, CMV said. The ship was freed after an operation at high tide at about 7.30pm, a spokesman said, adding: 'There has been no oil pollution arising out of the incident and none of the 763 mainly British passengers or crew have been injured. 'Passengers wishing to go ashore were transferred by tender and the local tour programme continued as scheduled.' Passengers had been allowed to leave the cruise ship, which was carrying more than 1,000 people when it ran aground in the Lofoten archipelago earlier today (Saturday) He added that divers had found no damage upon inspecting the ship's hull and propulsion system. Chris Coates, CMV's commercial director, said: 'We are doing everything we can to ensure that Marco Polo can resume her itinerary and remain confident that she will continue to operate her Northern Lights cruise as planned. 'The comfort and safety of our passengers is our top priority. Our passengers have been fully updated of the situation.' The Marco Polo is popular with tourists who want to see some of Norway's impressive fjords . Tickets for the northern cruise can cost up to £2,749 depending on the time of year, according to the CMV website. Resident Karl Roger Johnsen told Norwegian broadcaster NRK he thought the ship took a chance by sailing close to the rocky coast on its way into the quay. The same liner also ran aground briefly in a nearby archipelago in March, according to Norwegian media. The cause of that incident remained unclear. The Marco Polo was originally built as the Aleksandr Pushkin in East Germany in 1965 and later sold off after the collapse of the Soviet Union. To enable the ship to navigate through broken ice, The ship was constructed with greater hull strength and stability than usual in passenger ships of this size. Are you a passenger on the ship?
