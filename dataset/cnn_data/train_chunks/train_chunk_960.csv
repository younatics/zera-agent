"Reza Barati was murdered during a riot at Manus Island detention centre in February . Papua New Guinea police have arrested two men and reportedly charged them with the murder of an Iranian asylum seeker on Manus Island earlier this year. Reza Barati, 23, was violently killed and suffered severe head trauma during a brutal riot at the island's detention centre in February. Acting Deputy Police Commissioner and Chief of Operations Jim Andrews said one suspect, Joshua Kaluvia, was arrested on Monday in Kimbe, the capital of West New Britain. Another man, 28-year-old Manus Island resident Louie Efi was arrested in July. 'These two suspects will shed more light on the violence and killing and hopefully assist in the arrest of more suspects involved in the February violence and death,' Mr Andrews said in a statement on Tuesday. The ABC report that both of the men have now been charged with murder. Mr Andrews told ABC they are still searching for three more men believed to be involved. Both men are believed to have worked for G4S - the company that managed security at the detention centre when Mr Barati was killed. Mr Andrews said the police intelligence network showed that Kaluvia had fled from Manus to PNG's second largest city, Lae, before travelling throughout the highland provinces of Chimbu and Mount Hagen. Kaluvia then made the trip across across to Kimbe, where he was arrested. According to police arrangements to transfer the suspect to Port Moresby are underway as the investigation into Barati's killing continues. Scroll down for video . Two men - believed to have worked for the company who manage security on the island - have been arrested . Security company G4S says it has not been contacted by police about the arrests. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said he was aware of reports of the arrest of the two men, although that had not been formally confirmed by the PNG government. 'I do welcome those reports and that news. We have been working very closely with the PNG government and those authorities and we have made sure that we were doing everything at our end to assist,' he told Sky News. Mr Morrison said the justice process would now have to follow. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said he was yet to be formally notified of the arrests by the PNG government, while Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young called for Manus Island detention centre to be closed . 'We have confidence in that as we said we had confidence in the PNG police to go and do the job,' he said. Meantime, Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young called for the Manus facility to be closed. 'Reza Barati was murdered by the very people who were employed to care for him and keep him safe. This cannot be allowed to happen again,' she said in a statement. An independent review by former secretary of the Attorney-General's department, Robert Cornwall, was told a PNG employee of the Salvation Army had led the brutal bashing of Mr Barati. But PNG Police announced in May they believed two PNG workers and two expats were responsible for Mr Barati's death.","Reza Barati was killed during a violent riot at Manus Island detention centre .

"It was feared that an ‘incredibly important’ tomb dating to the time of Alexander the Great had been plundered in antiquity. But there is fresh hope that some treasure may have survived, after archaeologists unearthed two sculpted female figures, known as Caryatids, as they dug deeper at the site in northeast Greece. Experts believe that the ancient mound, in the Amphipolis region of Serres, around 65 miles (100km) from Thessaloniki, was built for a prominent Macedonian in around 300 to 325BC who may have been a relative or senior official for the famous king. Archaeologists have unearthed two sculpted female figures, known as Caryatids, (pictured) as they dig deeper at the site in the northeast of Greece. The half-bodied statues made of marble have thick hair covering their shoulders and are wearing a sleeved tunic . Caryatids are sculptures of females that take the place of a column to support a building. They are a distinctive feature in Ancient Greek architecture and famously hold up the Erechtheion on the Acropolis in Athens. Their elaborate hairstyles provide support to their necks that would otherwise be too thin and weak to support a heavy load. The Caryatids are made of marble and were unearthed on Saturday, Greece’s Culture Ministry said in a statement. The figurines support an inner entrance into the tomb and feature the same sculpting technique used for the heads and wings of two sphinxes found guarding the main entrance of the tomb in August. ‘The structure of the second entrance with the Caryatids is an important finding, which supports the view that it is a prominent monument of great importance,’ the Culture Ministry said. The figurines (pictured) support an inner entrance into the tomb and feature the same sculpting technique used for the heads and wings of two sphinxes found guarding the main entrance of the tomb in August . The face of one of the Caryatids is missing (pictured), but both have one hand outstretched to push away tomb raiders . The face of one of the Caryatids is . missing, while both figures have one hand outstretched in a symbolic . move to push away anyone who would try to violate the tomb. Archaeologists have said that the Amphipolis site appears to be the largest ancient tomb ever discovered in Greece at 1,935ft (590m) wide. But last warned that signs of forced entry outside the huge barrel-vaulted structure, indicated the tomb was emptied long ago. Experts had partially investigated the antechamber of the tomb and uncovered a marble wall concealing one or more inner chambers. They said that a hole in the decorated wall and signs of forced entry indicate it was plundered. Last month pictures emerged of a pair of sphinxes guarding the grave's main entrance beneath a large arch and experts said that most of the earth around the mythical creatures had been removed to reveal part of a marble lintel with frescoes. Chief archaeologist Katerina Peristeri, said that the monument being uncovered is a unique tomb, not just for Greece but for the entire Balkanic peninsula, and described it as being of ‘global interest’. Archaeologists . excavating an ancient mound in northern Greece (picutred) uncovered the entrance to an important tomb some months ago. It is . believed to have been built at the end of the reign of warrior-king . Alexander the Great and Prime Minister Antonis Samaras described the . discovery as 'extremely important’ Alexander (statue pictured) was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC, and died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC . Alexander III of Macedon was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC. He died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC. Alexander led an army across the Persian territories of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt claiming the land as he went. His greatest victory was at the Battle of Gaugamela, now northern Iraq, in 331 BC, and during his trek across these Persian territories, he was said to never have suffered a defeat. This led him to be known as Alexander the Great. Following this battle in Gaugamela, Alexander led his army a further 11,000 miles (17,700km), founded over 70 cities and created an empire that stretched across three continents. This covered from Greece in the west, to Egypt in the south, Danube in the north, and Indian Punjab to the East. Alexander was buried in Egypt. His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, far to the west. The lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. Prime . Minister Antonis Samaras said the discovery ‘is clearly extremely important’. Alexander, . who started from the northern Greek region of Macedonia to build an . empire stretching as far as India, died in 323 B.C. and was buried in . Egypt. His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, to the west, where the lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. Archaeologists were hopeful that an ancient mound in northern Greece could hold the remains of a senior official from the time of Alexander the Great. They discovered that its entrance is guarded by a pair of sphinxes (pictured) but last month warned that signs of forced entry indicate it was plundered in antiquity . Greece's culture ministry said that earth around the sphinx statues has been removed to reveal part of a marble lintel with frescoes (pictured) but hopes of finding further treasures now seem to be slim . The tomb is situated in Amphipolis region of Serres in Greece (marked). Archaeologists believe the grave may have belonged to a senior ancient official. While it looks largely undisturbed, there are fears that looting took place hundreds of years ago . In Greek tradition, the mythical sphinx has the haunches of a lion, sometimes with the wings of a great bird, and the face of a human - usually a woman. It was described by writers as being treacherous and merciless. In many myths, including Oedipus, those who could not answer a riddle posed by the monster, would be killed and eaten. The sphinx described by the Ancient Egyptians was usually male and more benevolent. In both cultures, they often guarded entrances to temples and important tombs. The oldest sphinx found guarding a site was discovered in Turkey and dates to 9,500 BC. But . archaeologists believe the Amphipolis grave, which is surrounded by a . surprisingly long and well-built wall with courses of marble . decorations, may have belonged to a senior ancient official. Dr . Peristeri has argued the mound was originally topped by a large stone . lion that was unearthed a century ago, and is now situated around 3 . miles (5km) from the excavation site. Geophysical teams have identified there are three main rooms within the huge circular structure, news.com.au reported. In . the past, the lion has been associated with Laomedon of Mytilene, one . of Alexander's military commanders who became governor of Syria after . the king's death. ‘The excavation will answer the crucial question of who was buried inside,’ Mr Samaras said. Archaeologists who fear that few treasures and clues to its owner may remain in the tomb, said that part of a stone wall that blocked off the subterranean entrance was found to be missing, while the sphinxes, which were originally six feet (2metres) high, lack heads and wings. Excavator Katerina Peristeri has argued the mound was originally topped by a large stone lion that was unearthed a century ago, and is now situated around 3 miles (5km) from the excavation site (pictured).

"An army of small robots, trained to work like ants, could someday help us have our first encounter with alien life. Nasa is developing the machines, dubbed 'swarmies', to land on a hostile planet and scan the soil for water, life or materials that could be turned into rocket fuel for astronauts. Each swarmie has a webcam, WiFi antenna and GPS device. They work on their own to survey an area, then call the others over when they find a cache of something valuable. Scroll down for video . An army of tiny robots, trained to work like ants, could help us have our first encounter with alien life. Pictured is the Rassor robot, one swarmie design, which is able to collect resources from a planet's surface . This is identical to the way an ant colony gathers around a food source to divide up the task of collecting the food and taking it back to the nest. Engineers have already developed programmes that tell the small, wheeled robots to go out in different directions and randomly search an area for a particular material. For now, the testing is limited to parking lots around Kennedy's Launch Control Center using four homemade robots called 'swarmies' that resemble stripped-down radio-controlled trucks. 'We're entering the phase where we do a ton of trial runs and collect the data and that's well ahead of schedule,' said Cheryle Mako, an engineer at Kennedy who is leading the project. Engineers have already developed programmes that tell the small, wheeled robots to go out in different directions and randomly search an area for a particular material. For now, the testing is limited to parking lots around Kennedy's Launch Control Center. If successful, swarmies could be used on exoplanets in the future . 'From an investigation perspective, we are spot-on and have made great strides.' Kurt Leucht, a Kennedy engineer working on the project, considers it possible that future missions could use this concept in a scaled-up way to develop an army of robots. 'Assuming this pays off, we know somebody's going to take this and extend it and go beyond the four or five rovers we have here,' Mr Leucht said. 'So as we design this and work it through, we're mindful about things like minimising bandwidth.' If testing is successful, the team plans to include the 'Rassor' design, an experimental mining robot designed at Kennedy to try out different techniques for digging into the lunar or Martian surfaces. The swarmies work on their own to survey an area on an alien planet (artist's impression right), then call the others over when they find a cache of something valuable. This is identical to the way an ant colony gathers around a food source (left) to divide up the task of collecting the food and taking it back to the nest . Compared to the car-sized Curiosity rover operating on Mars now, the swarmies and Rassor are much smaller and built with only a couple of instruments. As the testing continues, Nasa plans to incorporate the 'Rassor' robot in its designs, to try out different techniques for digging into the lunar or Martian surfaces. The robot looks like a small tank chassis with a drum at either end, each attached with arms. Because the drums are mounted on moving arms, they can act almost as legs letting the robot step and climb over obstacles. The robot is designed to skim lunar soil and dump it into a device that would pull water and ice out of the dirt and turn their chemicals into rocket fuel or breathing air for astronauts working on the surface. Producing water and fuel from the lunar soil would save the tremendous expense of launching the supplies from Earth, since 90 per cent of a rocket’s mass is normally made up of propellant, which can be made on the moon. 'For a while people were interested in putting as much smarts and capability as they could on their one robot,' Mr Leucht said. 'Now people are realising you can have much smaller, much simpler robots that can work together and achieve a task. 'One of them can roll over and die and it's not the end of the mission because the others can still accomplish the task.' Swarming robots could also be used on Earth. Assuming testing in the autumn goes well, the system can likely be called and modified for use in search and rescue tasks, with small robots heading out looking through the wreckage of a natural disaster or crash. They also could make efficient inspectors of pipelines and water mains, she suggested. 'This would give you something smaller and cheaper that could always be running up and down the length of the pipeline so you would always know the health of your pipelines,' Ms Mako said. 'If we had small swarming robots that had a couple sensors and knew what they were looking for, you could send them out to a leak site and find which area was at greatest risk.' Nasa's Kurt Leucht, from left, is working with undergraduate intern Gil Montague and post-graduate intern Karl Stolleis to develop the software that will control independent robots in a way that mimics the process ants use .","Each wheeled swarmie has a webcam, WiFi antenna and GPS device .

"This is the spectacular moment a mother locust laid 100 eggs deep into soil. At first she tentatively searched around the soil for the perfect place to welcome her offspring into the world. After giving birth to the eggs, the 50mm-long locust covered the hole with soil using her back legs to make sure they were safe.

The 26-year-old, from Yokohoma City, got up close and personal to the locust while she was 'in labour' and watched for the hour-long duration. 'First of all, I caught some female locusts and watched carefully when they started laying eggs,' said Mr Rokuta.

"A northeast Ohio man who kept a mentally disabled woman and her daughter, 5, in 'modern day slavery' and forced them to live in a snake pit for years has been sentenced to 30 years in prison. For nearly two years, 27-year-old Jordie Callahan and his girlfriend Jessica Hunt, 32, kept Shannon Eckley and her daughter locked up in their squalid Ashland, Ohio, apartment, where they controlled ever aspect of their lives, federal prosecutors say. To keep them in line, Callahan threatened to unleash their terrifying menagerie of pets on them - including a poisonous coral snake, a Burmese python that weighed 130 pounds, lizards, spiders, scorpions and 'numerous' dogs - including pit bulls, authorities say. Callahan and Hunt were convicted in March of forced labor, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and conspiracy to illegally obtain prescription drugs. Scroll down for video . Jordie Callahan, 27, seen here with one of his many pets, was convicted of forced labor, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and conspiracy to illegally obtain prescription drugs . For nearly two years, 27-year-old Jordie Callahan and his girlfriend Jessica Hunt, 32, kept Shannon Eckley and her daughter locked up in their squalid Ashland, Ohio, apartment, federal prosecutors say. The couple were accused of forcing the woman to shop, cook and clean up after their pit bulls. They also threatened to harm her young daughter if the woman didn't obey. The woman and her child were forced to live in a dark, damp basement without a bathroom and the woman was forced to commit sex acts, prosecutors said. Federal prosecutors also alleged that Callahan forced Eckley to beat her own daughter and recorded video of it to use as leverage against her. The couple held the woman from early 2011 to late 2012 in their home in Ashland, about 70 miles southwest of Cleveland, prosecutors said. She escaped the home by getting arrested for shoplifting a candy bar and telling police she wanted to go to jail because people had been mean to her. Threats: The suspects are accused of threatening to make their snakes and their pit bulls attack Eckley and her daughter if she didn't do their bidding . Federal prosecutors had urged Judge Benita Pearson to sentence Callahan, 27, to life in prison. His girlfriend, 31-year-old Jessica Hunt, is scheduled to be sentenced in Youngstown on Thursday. Attorneys for Callahan and Hunt argued at trial that authorities had sensationalized the woman's living conditions and said she was always free to come and go. In an argument for a new trial, the attorneys said the woman frequently visited a convenience store, attended appointments with social service agencies and even had home visits with social workers at Callahan and Hunt's home in Ashland. Two other people were indicted in the case. One suspect, Dezerah Silsby, was accused of luring the woman into Callahan's and Hunt's house with ice cream. She agreed to testify against the couple as part of a plea agreement and was sentenced to 45 months in prison in April. Her boyfriend, Daniel Brown, who was accused of helping to enslave the woman, also agreed to testify and received a five-year sentence in March.","Jordie Callahan, along with his girlfriend, imprisoned a mentally disabled woman for nearly two years .

"A webcam has captured the dramatic moment a SWAT team swept in and arrested an online gamer after a hoax call claimed he was armed and dangerous. Jordan Mathewson was streaming a game of Counter-Strike yesterday when dozens of armed officers surrounded his office in Littleton, Colorado, and screamed at him to hit the deck. A prank caller had told police he was a gunman who shot two colleagues and took hostages in the latest case of a worrying trend known as 'swatting'. Scroll down for video . Prank: Jordan Mathewson (inset) was playing a game of Counter-Strike from his office in Littleton, Colorado, when he was descended on by an army of SWAT team officers who believed he was an out-of-control gunman . Put your hands up! The live stream captured the moment the gamer, known as Kootra, was arrested yesterday . It is a phenomenon in which pranksters - many of them online gamers - trigger an armed police raid as a joke and it has already caused sieges in Long Island, Arizona and Michigan. Police warned yesterday the trend may one day result in an innocent person being shot dead. Dozens of people were evacuated from the office building and two nearby schools were closed as a precaution. Mr Mathewson, who goes by the name Kootra and has 220,000 Twitter followers, founded an online gaming group known as The Creatures and broadcasts daily on Youtube. He was midway through one of his streams at 11.30am when he paused, hearing officers bursting into room after room in the office block. 'What in the world?' he said. 'I think we're getting swatted'. Suddenly the officers crashed through the door screaming: 'Put your hands up! Get on the f****** ground! Don't you f****** move, you hear me boy?' Confused: The officers asked the gamer what he was doing. When he said 'streaming', he had to elaborate . Stay on the ground: The team was in the room for several minutes as surrounding schools were locked down . 'What about this is funny to you?' one officer asked, pointing his assault rifle towards the ground. 'What?' Mr Mathewson replied. 'I'm not doing anything that's funny'. His game's audio track then announced with perfect timing: 'Terrorists win'. The officers frisked and questioned their suspect while his online gaming friends continued their armed assault in the virtual world and even killed his character. Shock: A colleague live-tweeted the huge police raid . The SWAT officers then appeared confused about what the gamer was doing and asked him to explain. He replied: 'I'm sitting there playing a game, people are watching it, and I guess a joker thought it would be funny to call you guys in.' Mr Mathewson then had to show the officers in excruciating detail how to switch the camera off. A statement by the City of Littleton said police, firefighters and other agencies responded to the call and searched the building thoroughly twice before questioning several employees. The spokesman added: 'The caller claimed to have shot two co-workers, held others hostage, and threatened to shoot them. He stated that if the officers entered he would shoot them as well. 'Law enforcement in the South Metro Area and throughout the country are all too familiar with active shooter situations. In the wake of these incidents, Littleton Police and other law enforcement agencies train for rapid response to quickly rescue victims and neutralize the situation. 'Fortunately there were no injuries today, but a massive law enforcement response wastes resources and greatly increases the chances of innocent people being injured or killed. 'If the investigation determines that today’s incident was a hoax, those involved will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.' In April police warned swatting was becoming a national epidemic after an army of officers stormed a Long Island home under the belief a teen had shot dead his mother and brother and was ready to kill again. Within minutes of arriving, they discovered the hostage call was an act of revenge by a disgruntled 'Call of Duty' gamer who'd just been defeated. Harsh: As Mr Mathewson was frisked, his fellow players continued with their game and killed his character . Aftermath: Officers then realised it was a hoax. A City of Littleton statement said: 'A massive law enforcement response wastes resources and greatly increases the chances of innocent people being injured or killed' And in Tuscon, Arizona, an imposter was said to have claimed a 15-year-old boy would descend on the University of Arizona with an M4 rifle and body armour. The teenager said he believed he was the victim of somebody online 'that doesn't like me... for either me coding, or me playing video games.' In April, last year MailOnline reported how CNN host Wolf Blitzer fell victim to a 'swatting' prank after Montgomery County police got an urgent message saying that someone had been shot at Blitzer's Bethesda home. Officers set up a perimeter and started advancing on the house before a dispatch supervisor confirmed the message was a fraud. Blitzer was not in Bethesda at the time. After he was freed, Mr Mathewson told his 220,000 Twitter followers: 'Dag nabbit that was dern sure an experience. I am all Ok though. Thanks for all the supportive tweets everyone.'","Popular Jordan Mathewson was live-streaming game in Littleton, Colorado .

"Nasa bosses have said they are 'firmly committed' to building the world's biggest rocket to take man to Mars. Despite worries over the space agencies ability to pay for the project, officials said they have completed a rigorous review of the Space Launch System (SLS). Towering a staggering 384 feet tall, the Space Launch System (SLS) will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds. Scroll down for video . An artist's impression of the giant rocket taking off . Nasa doesn't have enough money to get its new, $12 billion rocket system off the ground by the end of 2017 as planned, federal auditors warned in July. The Government Accountability Office issued a report Wednesday saying Nasa's's Space Launch System is at 'high risk of missing' its planned December 2017 initial test flight. 'They can't meet the date with the money they have,' report author Cristina Chaplain said. She said it wasn't because the space agency had technical problems with the congressionally-required program, but that Nasa didn't get enough money to carry out the massive undertaking. 'We are on a journey of scientific and human exploration that leads to Mars,' said Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden. 'And we’re firmly committed to building the launch vehicle and other supporting systems that will take us on that journey.' For its first flight test, SLS will be configured for a 70-metric-ton (77-ton) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed Orion spacecraft beyond low-Earth orbit. In its most powerful configuration, SLS will provide an unprecedented lift capability of 130 metric tons (143 tons), which will enable missions even farther into our solar system, including such destinations as an asteroid and Mars. This decision comes after a thorough review known as Key Decision Point C (KDP-C), which provides a development cost baseline for the 70-metric ton version of the SLS of $7.021 billion from February 2014 through the first launch and a launch readiness schedule based on an initial SLS flight no later than November 2018. Conservative cost and schedule commitments outlined in the KDP-C align the SLS program with program management best practices that account for potential technical risks and budgetary uncertainty beyond the program's control. 'Our nation is embarked on an ambitious space exploration program, and we owe it to the American taxpayers to get it right,' said Associate Administrator Robert Lightfoot, who oversaw the review process. 'After rigorous review, we’re committing today to a funding level and readiness date that will keep us on track to sending humans to Mars in the 2030s – and we’re going to stand behind that commitment.' The biggest rocket ever made: The SLS will be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds . 'The Space Launch System Program has done exemplary work during the past three years to get us to this point,' said William Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for the Human Explorations and Operations Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. 'We will keep the teams working toward a more ambitious readiness date, but will be ready no later than November 2018.' Nasa has been testing small scale versions of the rocket amid fears it could be too loud. Four SLS RS-25 engines will be used to power the world's biggest rocket into orbit. 'A 5-percent scale model, including solid rocket motors, of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) is ignited to test how low- and high-frequency sound waves will affect the rocket on the launch pad,' the agency said. 'The data collected from the tests will be used to help direct and verify the design of the rocket's sound suppression system.' Previous tests have shown that most ofthe acoustic energy being emitted from a rocket engines is concentrated in the low to mid frequency ranges. 'This may have the potential to damage structures or harm personnel in the immediate vicinity of the test stand.' a Nasa report warned. The SLS is set to become the largest rocket ever built, dwarfing the rockets that took man to the moon and paving the way for manned missions to Mars. Nasa today said it is about to start testing the  engines for the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket - on the same stand that were used to perfect the Apollo rockets. Four engines, a modified version of the space shuttle main engine that powered missions into space from 1981 to 2011, will be used on the mega-rocket. 'This test series is a major milestone because it will be our first opportunity to operate the engine with a new controller and to test propellant inlet conditions for SLS that are different than the space shuttle,' said Steve Wofford, SLS Liquid Engines Element manager. Earlier this year Nasa signed a $2.8 billion contract with Boeing to build the giant rocket it is hoped will take us into deep space. How it compares: The SLS is larger than the Saturn rockets than launched man to the Moon. It will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today.

"Education Secretary: Nicky Morgan said the Coalition would press ahead with its reforms to restore faith in A-levels among employers and universities . Education Secretary Nicky Morgan last night attacked Labour’s ‘flip flops’ over A-levels and pledged to push ahead with reforms to restore confidence in the exam. With this year’s exam results released tomorrow, she condemned her Labour counterpart for threatening to dismantle Coalition A-level reforms just two years after backing an overhaul. In a policy announcement yesterday, Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt vowed to delay all A-level reforms until 2017 and allow teenagers once again to take controversial AS exams half-way through their courses. But the pledge came as details emerged of an interview with Mr Hunt two years ago, in which he decried AS-levels as a ‘waste of time’ and said he’d get rid of them because they created a ‘relentless examination system’. Mrs Morgan insisted the Coalition would press ahead with its reforms to restore faith in A-levels among employers and universities. ‘Parents, young people and teachers deserve better than Labour’s education flip-flops,’ she told the Mail. ‘Two years ago Tristram Hunt said he’d “get rid of AS-Levels” because they were a “waste of time”. Now he wants to keep them. ‘Labour’s plans to wind the clock back mean more exams and less learning. We agree with what Tristram said two years ago – that this is a waste of time. ‘Our reforms will ensure the qualifications young people work so hard for, once again, have the confidence of employers and universities.’ Under the current system, pupils sit AS-levels in the first year of the sixth-form and A2 exams in the second, with marks from both combining to produce the final A-level grade. Mrs Morgan’s predecessor, Michael Gove ordered AS-levels to be turned into standalone qualifications, with results no longer counting towards final A-level marks. Tests: Under the current system, pupils sit AS-levels in the first year of the sixth-form and A2 exams in the second, with marks from both combining to produce the final A-level grade (file picture) Most pupils will instead be examined at the end of their two-year A-level courses. Mr Gove also largely axed coursework and . ordered A-level courses to be rewritten with input from universities as . part of wider exam reforms due to be phased in from September 2015. Plans: Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt vowed to delay all A-level reforms until 2017 . But Labour disclosed yesterday it would delay all A-level reforms for two years to allow changes to GCSEs to bed in.  It will also scrap the centrepiece of the reforms – the downgrading of AS-levels. Mr Hunt, who will outline the plans in a speech next week, insisted the AS-level changes would ‘close the window of opportunity for many young people wanting to go to university’. The move would ‘turn the clock back on social mobility’ because disadvantaged pupils were in danger of losing out in university admissions without AS results behind them. ‘Having spoken to sixth formers across England, I know how valuable they find AS-levels in helping to shape their options and spur them on,’ he said. The pronouncement will fuel uncertainty in schools which are meant to start preparing to teach revamped A-levels from September this year, ahead of their introduction just four months after the May 2015 election. Dominic Cummings, who was a special adviser to Mr Gove, tweeted yesterday that Labour would in any case be unable to stop the reforms.","Tristram Hunt of Labour has vowed to delay all A-level reforms until 2017 .

"Ed Balls is preparing to hammer the owners of expensive homes to pay for an increase in spending on the NHS, it emerged yesterday. The Shadow Chancellor told the Labour conference in Manchester that his party would impose a mansion tax on houses worth more than £2million. He said the £2 billion raised each year would be used to help ‘safeguard our vital public services’. Indicating that the NHS would be the chief beneficiary, he said Labour would do ‘whatever it takes’ to preserve the health service. Scroll down for video . Ed Balls told the Labour conference his party would impose a mansion tax on houses worth over £2million . Mr Balls used his speech to attempt to rehabilitate Labour’s battered economic credibility by apologising for a string of mistakes in government and ruling out higher borrowing if it won power again. He also confirmed that Labour would scrap the Coalition’s marriage tax break – money which would be used to pay for the restoration of the 10p tax rate. But the speech was met with silence from delegates. And there was some booing when he said the retirement age would have to rise in future years. Mr Balls confirmed Labour would introduce the plan, originally floated by the Liberal Democrats, to levy a tax on the ‘highest-value properties – a mansion tax on houses worth over £2 million’. The speech was met with silence from delegates and there wasbooing when he said retirement age would rise . ‘We will do it in a fair, sensible and proportionate way; raising the limit each year in line with average rises in house prices,’ he said. ‘How can it be right that the billionaire overseas buyer this year of a £140 million penthouse in Westminster will pay just £26 a week in property tax – the same as the average-value property in that area?’ Labour would not say how much the mansion tax would raise. The Lib Dems have estimated it would raise £1.7 billion a year, but Labour’s higher bands for homes worth tens of millions could raise more. Mr Balls warned of fresh welfare cuts, including keeping the cap on child benefit for another two years. ‘We will have to make other decisions which I know will not be popular with everyone,’ he said, highlighting plans to raise the state retirement age and scrap the winter fuel allowance. Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to focus on the NHS in his conference speech today, and Mr Balls appeared to hint that more funding could be found to shore up services. Ed Balls feeling the pressure at a Huffington Post fringe meeting after the Labour Party conference yesterday . Mr Balls warned of fresh welfare cuts, including keeping the cap on child benefit for another two years . ‘Next year, after just five years of David Cameron – with waiting times rising, fewer nurses and a crisis in A&E – we will have to save the NHS from the Tories once again,’ he said. ‘And we will do what it takes.’ In an attempt to shore up his party’s economic credentials, Mr Balls said the party had to show it had ‘learned’ and was ready to be ‘honest with the country about what the last Labour government got right and what we got wrong’. Among the errors he listed were the lifting of transitional controls on migration from new EU states in 2004, and not regulating banks strongly enough before the credit crunch – although he stopped short of saying Labour had overspent before the financial crisis. ‘The truth is we should have regulated those banks in a tougher way,’ he said. Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) is expected to focus on the NHS in his conference speech today, and Mr Balls (left) appeared to hint that more funding could be found to shore up services . ‘It was a mistake. We should apologise for it. And I do.’ He said the Labour government had also failed to tackle the ‘underlying causes of rising spending on housing benefit and in-work poverty’, and should not have abolished the 10p tax rate. The Conservatives said Mr Balls’s speech committed Labour to an extra £20.4 billion of spending. Business minister Matthew Hancock said: ‘Labour haven’t learned their lesson. They would burden our children with more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.’ It was more about posturing than policy . Home Affairs Editor James Slack looks at Ed Balls’s promises, and concludes they were more about show than reality: . Ed Balls attended a Sure Start Centre in Manchester after announcing Labour would keep the child benefit cap . Incoming Labour ministers will take a 5 per cent pay cut . A populist gesture which will not make so much as a ripple in the ocean of public debt. The current government cut ministerial salaries by 5 per cent in 2010 and then froze them at that level for the duration of the Parliament, saving £3 million. Mr Balls’s announcement amounts to a deficit cut of 0.003 per cent. Save £400 million by capping rises in child benefit at 1 per cent . This real terms cut – inflation is currently 2 per cent – will raise very little. The Coalition has put the policy in place until 2016. Labour would simply extend it by another year. Treasury sources say the additional savings made by Mr Balls would be just £120 million. Raise minimum wage from £6.31 to £8 by the end of the next Parliament . Labour claims that applying the policy to the public sector would not cost any money, since the State would save in benefit payments currently made to top-up the income of the low-paid. However, business leaders warn the policy will be hugely expensive and lead to firms employing fewer workers. Reverse the Government’s ‘£3 billion tax cut’ for highest-rate taxpayers . Political positioning, designed to fuel the politics of envy, which might even cost the Exchequer money if top-earners respond by leaving the country, or find new ways of avoiding tax. A study for HMRC found that George Osborne’s decision to cut the 50p rate to 45p reduced tax revenues by only £100 million. Reimposing the 50p rate would raise a similar amount at best – and nothing like £3 billion. (Left to right) Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, Labour Leader Ed Miliband, Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman, Angela Eagle, Keith Vaz and Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna at Labour Party Annual Conference . Scrap the married couples tax break . More political posturing. The tax allowance is David Cameron’s flagship policy for recognising the importance of strong families, but Labours claim it amounts to social engineering. Over the course of the next Parliament, scrapping it will save £3 billion. The money will be spent on a new 10p tax rate for the lowest paid, not paying down the deficit. Axe winter fuel payments for the better-off . This would affect 600,000 people over 61 and will save only £100 million. It is worth recalling that Labour introduced the payments in the first place. Balance the books . Mr Balls’s boldest claim, but experts say that, if Labour is elected, Britain will borrow significantly more. On paying down the debt, Mr Balls’s timeframe is only ‘as soon as possible’. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said Labour’s plans would allow Mr Balls to spend £28 billion more than the Chancellor over the course of the next parliament, all of it borrowed. Increase corporation tax and impose a new financial transactions tax . Analysis by the Centre for Policy Studies warns that, overall, the tax changes planned by Labour will do great harm – costing the UK 300,000 jobs and more than £25 billion in GDP by damaging confidence and reducing investment. A spokesman said: ‘The consequences for GDP and employment will be negative.’ A scene from the hit 1965 film The Sound of Music, which Ed Balls admitted makes him 'cry every time' From the rough and tumble of the Commons to illegal tackles on the football pitch, Ed Balls has a reputation as a bit of a bruiser. It turns out, however, that he also has a soft side – admitting that he cries every time he watches The Sound of Music. The Shadow Chancellor spoke yesterday of his love for the 1965 musical about a nun called Maria who becomes a governess to the seven children of Captain von Trapp, an Austrian widower. An audience at the Labour Party conference laughed as he gave an account of his family holiday with wife Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary, and their three children on a Sound of Music tour in Salzburg. The family made their own clothes out of curtains and ran through meadows, singing songs from the film. Mr Balls said: ‘It was a three-hour trip where we each had a bike with a basket like Maria, and a beatbox with all the songs and you go on a guided tour playing the music. You run through a meadow. ‘And then Yvette said if we do it we must make clothes out of curtains, so we bought some curtain material and on the train to Salzburg we sat there sewing lederhosen for the teenage lads. The girls and women had head scarves.’ Asked if the movie made him cry, he said: ‘Every time. In the end, he marries Maria and they dodge the Nazis, and every time you watch it you never know if they are going to make it.’","Shadow Chancellor said party will impose mansion tax on homes over £2m .

"Pope Francis showed why he's the leader of the Catholic Church and not a major league baseball star yesterday when he urged a fan to throw him a baseball - and dropped it. The energetic 77-year-old was meeting crowds in St Peter's Square, Vatican City, when he spotted the onlooker just yards away behind a barrier clutching the ball. He urged the fan to throw the ball his way, despite some nervous looks from his security detail - who may well have suspected it to be a cunningly disguised hand grenade. Pope Francis reaches out to grab a baseball thrown by someone among the gathered pilgrims and tourists at the end of his weekly Wednesday General Audience in Saint Peter's Square, Vatican City, yesterday . The ball bounced in the pope's right hand before falling to the floor - and failing to explode, no doubt to his minders' relief. They dived to retrieve it for Francis, ABC News reported, who then signed it and returned to its owner. The incident came as Francis was returning to his quarters after his weekly audience in St Peter's Square, where he urged international assistance to fight the Ebola virus in Africa. I got this!

A fumble: The ball bounces in the right hand of the leader of the Catholic Church . There goes my chance at major league baseball: Francis watches the ball as it travels to the ground . Francis also urged the 30,000 people who attended to pray for the victims.

He issued a similar appeal Tuesday during a meeting with bishops visiting from Ghana.",Light-hearted moment came after he urged prayer for Ebola victims .

"More than 150 buildings in downtown Napa in California were badly damaged during the quake . President Barack Obama has declared a major disaster in California's Napa Valley wine region following last month's magnitude 6.0 earthquake which destroyed more than 150 buildings. The decision automatically releases funding to help state and local governments in the affected region to repair damaged infrastructure. The earthquake on August 24 destroyed an estimated $400 million worth of property in the wine region alone. The White House decision follows a request from California's Governor Jerry Brown who wrote to President Obama seeking assistance. Mr Brown's office believes that his state could receive up to $87 million in federal assistance to help repair facilities damaged by the earthquake. The funding will be paid as part of a cost-sharing arrangement, involving the state, tribal and local governments as well as some non-profit groups. The quake was the strongest to hit the San Francisco Bay area since a magnitude-6.9 quake in 1989 and did broad damage to Napa County and neighbouring Solano County. It broke water mains and gas lines and sparked gas-fed fires that destroyed several mobile homes. The worst damage came near the epicentre in downtown Napa, where a post office, library and a 141-room hotel were among 150 homes and buildings deemed unsafe to occupy. Napa County has estimated overall damage from the quake at more than $400 million, much of it to the area's famed wineries. A 65-year-old woman who suffered a head injury when a television struck her during last month's earthquake in California's wine country has died - the first death attributed to the magnitude-6.0 temblor, sheriff's officials said. Laurie Anne Thompson was at her Napa home during the quake when she was hit, according to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. Thompson told family members that she was asleep in a reclining chair in her living room when a TV struck her in the head during the earthquake, Captain Steven Blower said. Thompson did not go to the hospital until the next day when she told her family that she felt dizzy and experienced a decline in mental function, Blower said. She collapsed and was rushed to a hospital, where she died Friday due to bleeding in her skull, sheriff's officials said. 'Her condition continued to deteriorate over time and, unfortunately, she passed away,' Sheriff's Captain Doug Pike said. US President Barack Obama, pictured, confirmed that federal money would be spent on the clean up . The August 24 earthquake was the biggest to hit the region since a magnitude 6.9 event in 1989 . The earthquake has not claimed any other lives, but left scores of people injured, among them a 13-year-old boy who broke his pelvis in several places when part of a chimney collapsed on him. The epicentre was near the city of Napa and broke water mains and gas lines and sparked gas-fed fires that destroyed several mobile homes. The quake knocked over oak barrels weighing more than a quarter-of-a-tonne. An estimated 60 per cent of all Napa wineries suffered damage according to the Napa Valley Vintners Association. One winery suffered an estimated $8 million worth of damage. The earthquake destroyed gas and water mains across the Napa region as well as damaging roads .","President Barack Obama declares major disaster following the earthquake .

Passing thieves would then have no opportunity to steal any of the valuables if a user fell asleep because they would be on top of the locker. The Beach Vault comes with a special towel that has a hole cut away for easy access, which is covered by an attached, inflatable pillow. The idea is you then place the towel over the top of it, which has a hole in it so you can access the container, but covered by a built-in pillow.

"A survivalist who stripped down for a popular reality television series in the US is risking life and limb as he travels the globe to get hands on with the world's most lethal animals. Showing absolutely no fear, Forrest Galante's daring exploits include wrapping himself in a six-metre anaconda in the Amazon, cradling a shark in the Bahamas and coming within a few steps of a Komodo dragon in Indonesia. The 26-year-old Californian's jaw-dropping encounters are part of his quest to meet fascinating creatures while exploring the most beautiful, remote and wild places on the planet.

But there have been plenty of incredible highlights in some of the world's most exclusive places. No fear: Forrest Galante encounters a venomous Komodo dragon on famed Komodo Island in Indonesia . The adventure has taken Forrest Galante to the most beautiful, remote and wild places on the planet . Galante said: 'Some of my favourites would be Palau in Micronesia for the most iconic oceanic life imaginable and Andisabe in Madagascar for its unusual animals. 'Freediving with bull sharks in a tiny boat 140 miles off the coast of Texas during an inbound hurricane was extremely intense - probably one of the scariest things I've done.'

"A tall woman wearing a blonde wig and a low-cut red dress pursed her scarlet lips and asked if I'd like to be photographed with her. 'Who are you?' I asked. 'I'm Marilyn,' she said. Of course! But she could have been Jayne Mansfield, Jean Harlow or Madonna. A man has to be careful. I was on Hollywood Boulevard, where cinema's good and great have been imprinting their hands, shoes and signatures in the pavement for almost 90 years. This is the epicentre of the tourist vision of Tinseltown, where you can see the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Dolby Theatre, Madame Tussauds, the Roosevelt Hotel and souvenir shops. Blonde moment: Steve Turner with a Marilyn Monroe lookalike on Hollywood Boulevard . Lookalikes of Michael Jackson, Spider-Man, Zorro, Darth Vader, Robin Hood and Batman were on duty when I arrived, and have become part of the attraction. I duly snuggled up with Marilyn, pausing to reflect whether Norma Jeane had quite such a cleavage, and slipped her some dollars. But this wasn't the Hollywood I was here for. I wanted to see the hidden Hollywood, the hip Hollywood - the places frequented by the people who make the movies. They don't hang around here, except on Oscar night when they arrive and disappear by limousine. To be fair to Tourist Hollywood, I had to give it a whirl. I'd visited LA numerous times over the past 40 years but had never done the 'homes of the stars' tour. It felt intrusive. I didn't want to be seen gawping. Star gazing: The Starline bus tour includes visits to the homes of Quentin Tarantino and Justin Timberlake . I bought a Hollywood City Pass for $59 (£34) that gave me entry to some attractions as well as a Starline bus tour. I'd wrongly assumed that these tours visited the homes of stars from all eras, but the focus was very much on the big names of today. The first five houses (in order) belonged to Jason Statham, Quentin Tarantino, Sasha Baron Cohen, Justin Timberlake and Bruno Mars. The bigger the star, though, the higher the wall. Too often I was left with glimpses of rooftops or upstairs windows. Nevertheless, the two-hour tour served as an introduction to the layout of mythical Hollywood from Mulholland Drive and Rodeo Drive to Laurel Canyon and Holmby Hills. I felt just as dubious, at first, about the prospect of visiting the Dolby Theatre, home of the Oscars, with another of my passes. I didn't think there was anything about the ceremony I could learn in a 40-minute tour. I was wrong. Tourist trap: The movie makers don't hang out on Hollywood Boulevard - except on Oscar night . I learned that storefronts outside the theatre are draped on the night to hide any advertising, that the material value of a Oscar is £300, and all the statuettes are numbered because they're presented unengraved and are often mislaid in the bar. We were taken up the theatre's sweeping stairs. 'They're made for women with high heels,' said our guide. 'They're wide and shallow - the stairs that is, not the women.' In the bar we were shown an actual Oscar (in a glass case) and finally we went on to the stage itself, where we could imagine giving our acceptance speeches. Something else I didn't know was that actors must apply to have their stars on the pavement of Hollywood Boulevard. The Chamber of Commerce decides who fits, and it costs the applicant £21,000. Concentration of cool: A vintage clothes store in Silver Lake, which locals refer to as Franklin Village . But all this was a long way from the true heartbeat of Hollywood. The (mostly) young people who write the scripts, design the costumes, create the music, direct the action and act in the movies live, work and play elsewhere. I asked my friend Bobette Buster, an adjunct professor at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts, and a consultant to studios such as Pixar, Fox and Disney, to draw me up an itinerary of cool venues. And so I stayed at the Avalon (9400 West Olympic Boulevard), a smart yet unassuming hotel tucked away in a residential corner of Beverly Hills. It was once the Beverly Carlton, and home to Marilyn Monroe. Its decor is so convincingly late 1950s/early 1960s that you half expect Frank Sinatra to saunter in, flanked by a couple of heavies. Retro look: Minnie Driver and Brad Pitt are fans of the 101 Coffee Shop at 6145 Franklin Avenue . Rodeo Drive is just a walk away from the Avalon and is jammed full of top designer clothing and jewellery stores. One of them, Bijan, is believed to be the most expensive store in the world. You can only enter by appointment and the average customer spend is £60,000. Hollywood's hip creatives prefer streets that seem a little meaner. One of the favoured spots at the moment is in the Hollywood Hills on Franklin Avenue between Argyle and Bronson. The 101 Coffee Shop at 6145 Franklin Avenue has a juke box, pebbledashed ceiling, faux rock wall, and prominently displayed framed family photographs. It feels like a 1970s diner untouched by time but has actually been retro-designed and attracts the likes of Brad Pitt, Nicolas Cage, Minnie Driver and Quentin Tarantino to its leather booths. Over the music of the Doobie Brothers I could hear the sounds of deals being done. At night, the sidewalk between here and Bronson bustles. The biggest attraction on the block - and the one that drew the longest queue - was the Upright Citizen's Brigade Theatre at 5919 Franklin Avenue. Here, comedy shows play every night. I got into a patchy 90-minute stand-up show for £3. The next event was a Q&A with producer/ director/writer Judd Apatow, of Anchorman and Bridesmaids fame, that sold out. Cosy hangout: A customer is pictured taking tea at the Casbah Cafe on Sunset Boulevard . Rivalling what locals refer to as Franklin Village is Silver Lake, to the immediate east of East Hollywood. The highest concentration of cool is both sides of Sunset Boulevard. Here I found high-end specialist shops - Vacation Records for vinyl, Secret Headquarters for comic books, Clementine for flowers. The clothing stores are similarly specialised; Ragg Mopp for vintage, Surplus Value for military cast-offs, Bucks & Does for jeans and shirts. Maya, a hostess at the fashionable Cafe Stella, told me: 'There are a lot of young creatives who live around here, but not like those at Franklin. Silver Lake has more soul. Franklin is more Hollywood.' Cafe Intelligentsia (3922 Sunset Boulevard) is the neighbourhood meeting place. Rows of Apple Mac tappers sat outside at single tables, with one eye on their screen and the other on the parade of people. At the cosy Casbah Cafe (3900 Sunset Boulevard), the girl next to me with a laptop was working on a screenplay. Dead famous: Johnny Depp has been spotted at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery on Santa Monica Boulevard . Downtown LA is the latest area to be infiltrated by artists, film-makers, musicians and writers. They are taking over old industrial spaces and lofts in an area designated the Arts District, resulting in an edgy mix of poverty, creativity and refurbishment. The Urth Caffe (451 South Hewitt Street), where you can drink organic coffee and eat home-baked pasties, is around the corner from skid row. Back in Hollywood, Bobette recommended that I check out the Hollywood Forever Cemetery (6000 Santa Monica Boulevard). It's making a name as a music-show venue. 'They also have outdoor movie events,' she told me. 'It's a very cool scene there among the tombstones and crypts of legends like Rudolph Valentino, Jayne Mansfield and Cecil B. DeMille.' Shoppers' paradise: The street sign on the exclusive Rodeo Drive and, right, a face-painted couple mark Mexican Day Of The Dead at the Forever Cemetery . The big event while I was there was El Dia de los Muertos - the Mexican Day of the Dead. I'd never had such a good time in a graveyard. The place was packed with makeshift altars, temporary stages and food stalls for an event that mocks death and celebrates ancestors. Mexican music boomed, Aztec dancers shook their feathers and people sat on gravestones painting each other's faces to look like grinning skulls. Johnny Depp recently turned up at Hollywood Forever for a Johnny Ramone Tribute (both Johnny and Dee Dee of the Ramones are cemetery residents). The irony is that most of Hollywood's cool 'new' places have already been cool, in the past. Downtown was Raymond Chandler's patch, Jack Kerouac headed there on his first Californian visit in 1947 and Silver Lake was where Walt Disney established his first studio in 1926. Hollywood is elusive. Just as you think you've found it, it pops up somewhere else. 'It's not really a place,' Bobette said. 'More a state of mind.'

"Had enough of extravagant holidays? Tired of five-star suites, three-hundred thread count sheets and room service? Then why not stay in a hovel? Or, to be precise, a half-completed treehouse with no bathroom facilities for £11 ($19) a night. The latest holiday accommodation craze comes courtesy of hovelstay.com, a website which specialises in ‘anti-luxury’ holiday rooms for travellers on a shoestring budget. Hawaiian Kine Healing Retreat: The 18' yurt, which costs £15 a night, is surrounded by a fenced courtyard and advertised as an 'extremely relaxing retreat for one or more persons.' Dome hideaway in South Carolina: This hobbit-esque  hovel will set travellers back £45 a night and is registered as hurricane-proof on the website . But not every traveller can take advantage of the rock bottom rates as bookings are only accepted from those enrolled in college or university and have a valid student ID card. The recently launched website, based in Glendale California, was set up by three friends who wanted to offer college students inexpensive travel digs. And the rather unusual approach seems to have taken off as, according to reports, the site has secured more than £700,000 ($1.2m) funding from investors in London and Dubai. The £11 a night Half Completed Tree House in Los Angeles  offers 'incredible views of the neighbouring yards.' There are no loo facilities though and would-be renters are advised to use the nearby Valerio Service station . The £15 a night yurt (left) comes with two camp bed. The website also offers the chance to hang out out in a covered patio in a Nicaraguan hammock for £12 a night . Guests can book to stay in Puka Hale - a tiny hut in a volcanic crater on the property of the Hedonisia Hawaii Sustainable Community and costs £18 a night . ‘We really wanted to be the anti-luxury vacation rental site,’ Micheal Bolger, CEO and co-founder of hovelstay.com said. ‘Two of us who had years in the vacation rental business were always floored at how serious a lot of these vacation rental sites took their properties, describing the, as luxury when in fact they weren’t.’ All rooms listed on the site are priced at less than £60 ($99) and students can reserve them for a night, a week or a semester.

"Tsunamis - the devastatingly huge waves caused by underwater earthquakes - are usually associated with coastlines of Japan or the Indian Ocean. But new research proves that massive tidal waves sparked by seismic activity have also ravaged European shores in the past - and could be repeated. Scientists from the University of Portsmouth found geological evidence that tsunami waves have swept over Malta's coastline - rising to up to 20 metres above sea level in some places. The beaches of Malta are popular with tourists - but scientists have warned the area could witness a tsunami . They identified 70-ton boulders inland that had been picked up from the seabed before being carried along by the huge waves and dumped far inland. Studies of neighbouring coastlines show there has been a major tsunami, on average, every 400 years, thought to be linked to earthquakes beneath Mount Etna in Sicily, Italy. Scientist Professor Derek Mottershead said: 'It appears that no event of the magnitude indicted by the new evidence has occurred within the past 300 years and so there is no historical memory of any such devastating event.' But, he added: 'It is highly likely that there have been other equally devastating waves previously and that there will be more in the future.' The north-east coast is now Malta's most densely populated region and if a similar sized wave struck today, it could threaten thousands of people, experts are warning. Many residents and holidaymakers live by or visit the north-eastern coasts, where the towns are built right up to the edge of the shoreline. Tsunamis are commonly associated with Japan (pictured), but experts say they could hit coastlines in Europe . Lead scientist Dr Malcolm Bray said: 'The most important thing we can do is to educate people about the risk and give the Maltese government the evidence needed to prepare and protect residents and holidaymakers. 'However, if a repeat tsunami occurred now, the risks are high. In the light of these recent findings it now appears that Malta would benefit from a re-evaluation of the tsunami threat . 'If people feel an earthquake, they need to know that there is a risk of a tsunami, and if they see the sea recede they should know to get to higher ground. 'Fortunately in Malta, higher ground is never far away, but people do need to be made aware of the risks.' It is thought earthquakes linked to the Mount Etna volcanoes (pictured) have caused tidal waves in the past .","Evidence shows tsunamis have hit Malta and Mediterranean in the past .

"This 87-year-old great-grandmother has taken a hot air balloon ride, been in a helicopter flight and travelled to Australia - twice. Now Betty Bicker-Robinson, from Cobham, Kent, has jumped out of a plane from 12,000ft. Betty, who has eight children and 13 great-grandchildren, had such a good time that she's vowed to do it again when she turns 90. Betty Bicker-Robinson completed a tandem skydive last Sunday at Headcorn Airfield in Kent . Up in the air: The brave great-grandmother was the first one out of the plane . Ms Bicker-Robinson completed a tandem skydive last Sunday at Headcorn Airfield in Kent last Sunday to raise funds for EllenorLions Hospices.

"In a parallel universe, there is a version of me who is toned, tanned and good at juicing. A me who wears rollerblades (and doesn’t fall over); a me who watches her carbs; a me who springs out of bed, rather than emerging from it like a Kraken roused from under the duvet. In that parallel universe, it is a fair bet that I live at Miami’s Canyon Ranch Resort. Strike a pose, there's nothing to it: The resort offers guests a place where they can work on their wellbeing . Let me let you in on a secret: If you want to get fit then you need to go where the fit people are. It is a whole lot easier to go with the tide. And that is precisely the reason I am at Canyon Ranch – a high temple of American vitality that is windswept and glossy. And has really good teeth. Naturally. Bored of the usual ‘Try jogging. Fail’ palaver, I have decided on a one-two punch of a fitness boost and a dose of vitamin D. I am not sure that I know what I have let myself in for as I pack my tracksuit bottoms and greying trainers, and head off across the Atlantic. Putting some effort into it: Even if the work-out is tough, the view offers a sight to soothe the soul . Health is serious stuff, Stateside. In Miami, the question is not so much ‘when should you go to the gym?’ as ‘why aren’t you there already?’. I am, however, in luck. My first requirement of any ‘break’ that involves running around a lot is a splendid setting in which to do it. Ideally involving a stretch of sand sweeping away outside my window, its edges tickled by surf rolling under big blue skies. So far, so good. I breathe deeply on the balcony of my immense and rather fabulous corner suite. Miami Beach is the quieter, less iconic neighbour to bustling Art Deco South Beach – which sits a 10-minute taxi ride away through this palm-fringed city. But its Cuban-American cool and margarita nightlife can wait. I am here to be perky, not plastered. As Miami’s prodigal daughter Gloria Estefan once said, the rhythm is gonna get ya. And by that, I’m sure she was referring to the fact you can’t spend a day in the city without ending up doing some kind of cardio workout. Pretty sure, anyway. Settling in nicely: Left - the view from the hotel terrace; right - Anna takes a quick break with a walk on the sand . My husband – a man who is never normally seen trying to combine a knee lift and a disco beat – proves this neatly. We have only just checked in when he decides to try ‘cardio kickboxing’. With eight nut-brown septuagenarians and a model. He lasts 45 minutes, blaming his lack of endurance on jet-lag. I opt for a ‘Ballet Barre Workout’ amid a room full of steel-thighed women for whom the instructor's exhortation to ‘activate the pain’ is greeted with beatific smiles. Albeit not by me. You do not have to be a lithe lycra babe to come here, though. The vibe is inclusive – as are the facilities. A vast range of daily classes is included in your room price – from ‘gentle’ options like Zumba and Qi Gong to things with scary names like ‘TRX III’ and ‘Muscle Max’. There is also a full programme of free health workshops to choose from. Plus a gym, a spa and two pools. Personal training, spa treatments and all manner of mind/body/spirit consultations can also be paid for separately, or included in a package. A lot to enjoy: The resort sits in a pristine position on the edge of the Atlantic on Miami Beach . It is all so positive. As is the American way, health is made convenient. The cola is organic, the coffee Fairtrade, and the hotel bar’s mojitos are made with antioxidant acai berries. You even have to ask for the salt (should you want it). But no-one feels deprived - for every banana smoothie breakfast, there is a healthy fry up or pancakes. Whole wheat, of course. Needing a change of pace, I book one of the health packages. My ‘Energizer’ course kicks off with an Abhyanga massage. And the healing energy session that follows is quite the experience. Tornado-like Michelle Alva had me singing and breathing while she runs around the room ringing Tibetan bowls. ‘I am going to put it on your PHONE!’ she enthuses at the end of the session, grabbing my iPhone and singing an affirmation into it. I am not entirely sure what had gone on – it is a bit like being put in a blender with a guru and an aerobics instructor. Keeping up with the style of things: The hotel lobby flirts with Miami's classic Art Deco vibe . But I do feel energised. Some things are best not deconstructed. I also try an hour’s meditation with Giancarlo, who teaches me to drown out the gym music and empty my mind. If you can go to your happy place with Justin Bieber in the background, finding it sitting up a mountain is going to be a cinch. My final session is with nutritionist Staci. I am not looking forward to being told not to eat carbs. Fortunately, although she keeps trying to persuade me to do things with flax, Staci proves open and really helpful. ‘Eat carbs, eat wheat – but as a weekly treat,’ she encourages, while giving tips on spaghetti squash and vegan truffles. She does not even blanch when I tell her I am doing the 5:2 diet – and gives me ways to maximise it. And relax: Guests can enjoy ocean views and soft beds once they have completed their day's exercise . This is the key to Canyon Ranch – you are allowed to pursue what works for you. Staci and I finish with a chat about lifestyle. ‘You’re 40?’ she exclaims. ‘I thought you were in your late 20s!’ This is what a week at Canyon Ranch will do for you. Better than a facelift any day. A four-night stay at Canyon Ranch Miami Hotel & Spa (www.canyonranch.com), including return flights from London and a mini 'Energiser' retreat, costs from £1385 per person. Price is based travel after 26 May 2014 (two people travelling together).

"From a dog's point of view it must be very tempting to play with a plastic ball - especially when that ball contains a small, cute rodent.

'She does the same with the rabbit,' the man says of the family's canine rodent protector. The other dog tries a couple of times to play with the hamster in its ball but eventually gives up as he is pushed out of the way. The relationship between dogs and hamsters isn't always quite so harmonious. Stories of dogs and cats eating beloved furry pets are rife - which means Nina probably deserves a pat on the head and maybe even a treat for being so kind. Oh no you don't: Nina steps up her protector role and tackles the over-friendly rodent worrier .

"The number of guns and amount of alcohol being smuggled into the country through UK airports has risen sharply, new research reveals. The figures show that in 2013/14, 605 firearms were seized by UK border staff, a rise from the 412 of the previous year and 316 in 2011/12. And there has been an overall rise in confiscated alcohol in comparison to previous years. Sharp rise: The graph shows that more guns have been seized in the past year than in previous years . 2013/14 has seen 56.5m litres of beer, wines and spirits confiscated - a dramatic leap from the 46m litres and just over 35m seized in 2011/12 and 2010/11 respectively. Cigarette figures have drastically reduced, compared to 2010/11's 650m to last year's 318m. The figures also showed some rather unusual seizures including nine grey francolin birds, 13 San Salvador rock iguanas. 15 kilos of ivory and 400 fake England football shirts. The figures were revealed by Essex-based freight company Barrington Freight who filed a Freedom of Information request . The number of illegal substances being brought into the country has doubled, the research revealed .

'Border Force plays a key role in the fight to stop the importation and exportation of illegal and restricted goods entering the UK,' said a spokesman told The Telegraph. 'Our measures are working – we are hitting our targets on seizures of high priority goods including firearms and alcohol. These seizures in turn help to combat the organised crime and corruption that often accompanies the trade in illegal goods.'","Research highlights the number of illegal imports flooding into Britain .

"The next time you’re cruising the high seas around Honduras it could be on a vessel that was once used to smuggle cocaine and other illicit drugs across international waters. In the ongoing war on drugs, the Central American country has announced plans to convert boats seized from traffickers into tourist cruisers. The boats will ferry visitors to hot spots in the picturesque Gulf of Fonseca in the Pacific Ocean, according to Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez. Drugs war: Boats seized from traffickers in Honduras will be converted into tourist cruisers . Bordering three countries, the Gulf of Fonseca is becoming a more popular tourist draw thanks to its islands, nature reserves, beaches and rock cliffs. Some of the areas remain largely untouched by tourists, but Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua are stepping up efforts to stimulate their budding tourism industries. Honduras hopes the converted drugs boats will bring tourist dollars to a region that is riddled with poverty and located on a major thoroughfare for traffickers. Related links The gulf itself has been a source of conflict for Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, which have had disputes about territorial waters and who controls which islands, Fox News Latino reported. According to the government’s plans, the main ferry hub would be located in Coyolito, a fishing village surrounded by the San Lorenzo nature reserve that serves as a gateway to the Honduran islands.

"Hundreds of people have objected to plans for a controversial leisure and housing development  created by a team that includes Judy Murray and golfer Colin Montgomerie. The proposed Park of Keir development promises to create jobs and includes a hotel, a tennis and golf super-centre, and 100 homes near Stirling in Central Scotland. But the plans mooted by the group including the mother of Wimbledon champion Andy Murray have been met with strong opposition from 200 residents who have filed objections with Stirling Council. Controversy: Judy Murray, pictured with son Andy, is one of the partners behind the development . The leisure centre, at Park of Keir between Dunblane and Bride of Allan in Stirlingshire, is being touted by Montgomerie as a place to nurture the next generation of Scotland’s tennis and golf stars. If approved, it will feature six indoor and six outdoor tennis courts, a six-hole golf course and practice range, mini golf, a 3G multi-sport all-weather pitch and space for changing facilities, coaching suites, and cafe and restaurant. The facility is expected to create around 170 jobs and developers claim it will pump millions of pounds into the local economy and attract tourists. If the plans are given the green light, it will result in the building of the second hotel linked to the Murray family. Professional golfer Colin Montgomerie says the leisure centre would nurture future golf and tennis stars . Earlier this year, Andy opened a five-star resort in Perthshire, north of the proposed Park of Keir development site. Five-star Cromlix, which was crowned Scottish hotel after opening in April, boasts 10 bedrooms and five suites which overlook manicured grounds and tennis courts. Planning permission was lodged for the latest plans last month by the Park of Keir’s partners – Murray, Montgomerie and King Group. King Group owns the land, which occupies about 15 per cent of the 110-hectare park. After receiving almost 200 complaints, Stirling Council  extended Tuesday's deadline for objections or letters of support until council planners are ready to make a recommendation. Ann Shaw, secretary of Residents Against Greenbelt Erosion (RAGE), the campaign group fighting the development, said she asked planning bosses at Stirling Council to extend the deadline. Five-star: Andy Murray's Cromlix hotel opened in Perthshire earlier this year to rave reviews . She said: ‘It is typical of the way planning applications are dealt with by our council. ‘Controversial ones are submitted at a time when people are least likely to have time to consider it such as now, during the holiday season, or just before Christmas. ‘Many organisations, such as the local community councils, do not meet during summer and have not had time to look at this application, yet it impacts on all our lives.’ Following a series of public consultations and meetings with community stakeholders, the development team scaled back some aspects of the original proposal. The developers changed the golf course to six holes from nine and promised to maintain a permanent green belt between Dunblane and Bridge of Allan. They also indicated they are keen to enter into discussions with local communities about turning residual land into a community park to address concerns about future housing development.","Stirling Council has received almost 200 objections to the proposal .

"For those interested in seeing what really goes on at the annual Burning Man festival - but who don't want to spend a week in the remote Nevada desert - this video offers the perfect insight. The incredible drone footage -filmed high above Black Rock Desert - reveals what really happens at the festival, which this year saw nearly 70,000 people attend. With wide scenic shots show a hive of revellers having fun as well as the festival's effigy - a large statue of a man - being set on fire at the conclusion of the week-long rave. Scroll down for video . Welcome to the playa! Black Rock City is the week-long festival's pop-up, self-contained community . There were dust storms and extreme weather conditions during last week's Caravansary-themed celebration in Black Rock City: the self-contained community that is both built and dismantled during the festival. Money is banned for the duration of the quirky art and music festival 110 miles north of Reno. And revellers must bring all food, water and other necessities required for their extended stay. The festival's effigy is meant to be a symbol of catharsis, reflection and new beginnings for participants. The Burning Man statue is set on fire at the end of the week in Nevada's Black Rock Desert . During Burning Man, participants create a self-contained city, only to dismantle it one week later . The drone footage, captured high above the remote desert, captured images during the day and evening of quirky art installations, the sprawling tent metropolis and even a Ferris wheel. This year also marked the 26th anniversary of the festival, which had its biggest turnout yet. Overall, the weeklong festival leading up to Labor Day was successful and safe except for Thursday's death of a 29-year-old Wyoming woman who was struck by a bus carrying passengers on the playa of the Black Rock Desert. Crime statistics will not be released until later this month. But the festival's eclectic artwork, offbeat theme camps, concerts and other entertainment drew praise from participants from around the world. More than 70,000 participants were involved with this year's Burning Man 2014 'Caravansary' Battling dust storms and extreme heat, attendees must bring all their own food, water and camping supplies .

Ron Adair, of Ojai, California, said: 'It's a little hard to have that many nights in a row and get by on four, five, six hours of sleep every night.' After it moved from San Francisco, the inaugural Burning Man in Nevada drew only about 80 people in 1990. This year's Burning Man was also met with controversy. Some festival-goers complained the essence of the event - a society without currency based on communal effort and giving - had been ruined by the high number of billionaires and tech professionals bringing with them RVs, bodyguards, and other high price tag luxuries.","Burning Man 2014 brought together nearly 70,000 festival-goes .

"Terrified passengers on a flight across Europe feared they were moments away from death after one of the plane's engine's failed in mid-air. After an emergency was declared by the flight crew, the plane's 'weeping' pilot warned holidaymakers that they had six minutes before they would crash, a passenger says.

The drama ended when the Boeing 737 landed safely in Venice, Italy, and now the airline is downplaying the incident. Mr Girard, who was travelling with his wife and daughters aged four and six months, said the ordeal began shortly after take-off when the pilot told passengers to prepare for turbulence. He said: 'Then people at the back of the plane said one engine had stopped working, and this was soon confirmed by the pilot. 'He said we would have to make an emergency landing in Venice, and joked it would be a great chance to visit the city.' Passengers were not amused and the pilot soon told them to put on their life jackets and remove any jewellery. Mr Girard said: 'He said we would have to make a crash landing at sea and warned us there could be an explosion. 'Everyone was terrified, even the cabin crew.

"A drunk British man somehow managed to escape criminal charges after he ran onto the runway area, stripped naked and started dancing in front of stunned travellers at New Delhi’s main airport. The cheeky Brit caused the ruckus at Indira Gandhi International Airport’s Terminal 3 in the early hours on Saturday. Despite the major security breach and indecent exposure, the man was allowed to continue his journey after he put his clothes back on and sobered up, the Hindustan Times reported. Scroll down for video . Security breach: Authorities say the man managed to access the runway area before stripping naked . The bizarre incident unfolded at about 4:30am when the 45-year-old man arrived on a flight from London while en route to Tokyo. He got drunk at a restaurant inside the terminal while waiting for his connecting flight. The boozy Brit's exploits began when he broke a fire alarm box that immediately unlocked a nearby fire exit. That allowed him to bypass security gates and run onto the restricted aircraft apron. Police say the man bypassed security and ran onto an aircraft apron after he broke a fire alarm box . Boozy Brit: The man faced a lengthy stopover, so he decided to get drunk at an airport restaurant . Police denied a report that the man attempted to get on a plane that was open for boarding, saying he was apprehended before he reached the boarding area, the Hindustan Times reported. A senior airport official told the newspaper: ‘This is a major breach of airport security. Since the incident happened in the early hours and there were not too many passengers in the airport, major chaos was averted.’ The unruly holidaymaker was treated for injuries to his hand before he was allowed to board his flight to Japan, NDTV reported. No case was brought against him, although authorities notified the British High Commission in New Delhi.","Boozy Brit caused a ruckus at Indira Gandhi International Airport .

"The dreaded grey skies and crippling post-holiday blues are enough to compel millions of Brits  to  book their next exciting getaway in early September and enjoy some glorious sunshine. Shorter days, damp cold weather and decreasing sunlight are also a major factor as people adjust to the change of seasons and desperately seek one last summer fix. This Monday, 8 September, has been branded 'Travel Blue Monday,' a day in which record numbers of Britons are most likely to feel glum about the UK climate and book an exciting trip abroad. Lazy days: An autumn sun holiday just as the weather is adversely changing could be a welcome tonic . Monarch Airlines says it has experienced a 30 per cent spike in bookings on 'Travel Blue Monday' in the past as the dreary climate and the return to work following a summer holiday encourages Brits to plan another escape. The desire for late sunshine is so strong for many holidaymakers that Monarch Airlines says 45 per cent of those who book their trip do so with the intention of taking a break within the next six weeks. A further one in five buoys themselves with the promise of a summer holiday, booking their next annual trip to give themselves something to look forward to during the cold winter months. Over half (52 per cent) of Brits booking on this peak day secure a leisurely week away, whilst one in six plans a major break lasting longer than 10 days. One in eight plumps for a quick-fix treat, booking a short break to whisk them away. A dreary  wet morning in the UK is hard to appreciate after a long summer and many Brits will relish a holiday . Sunshine is the top priority for Brits fed up with the soggy UK, with a significant 93 per cent of bookings being made to sun destinations such as the Balearics, Canaries and Sharm-El-Sheik. Spain is the most desirable destination for British people, making up 42 per cent of all flights booked. Southerners seem to be most affected by the return to work, with over 40% of bookings being made for flights out of Gatwick and Luton airports. Ian Chambers, head of retail and online at Monarch Airlines, said: 'Having experienced a wonderful summer holiday and extra days off thanks to a series of bank holidays, September with its return to work can bring many people back to earth with a bump.' Down and out: Many office workers in the UK will think about booking a holiday on 'Travel Blue Monday' Mr Chambers said the prospect of not having any time off until Christmas and being stuck in the grey and cold UK climate is not very appealing. He said: 'The second Monday of September seems to bring a collective need across the nation to escape, or at least have a break to look forward to, no matter how far away it may seem. 'Last year saw bookings increase by almost a third on Travel Blue Monday - with the heat wave that we’ve enjoyed this summer followed by a frankly miserable August weather-wise in the UK, we’re anticipating an even greater spike in sales.'

"A firefighter has been hailed a hero after helping to save the life of a passenger who was choking and had stopped breathing on board a flight to the UK from Australia. Neil Punt, from Mark, Somerset, was returning from a holiday, flying between Singapore and Abu Dhabi with his family, when a fellow passenger became unwell at 30,000ft. The 44-year-old, based at Weston-super-Mare fire station, said he stepped in and used the skills he had learned on the job to help resuscitate the woman. Neil Punt was flying between Singapore and Abu Dhabi when a fellow passenger became unwell . He said: 'It was a night flight and most of the passengers were asleep. 'I became aware of a bit of a commotion a few rows in front of me and went to see if I could help. 'A lady had stopped breathing and had no pulse. Using the first aid skills I have as a firefighter, I applied three back slaps.' When this technique failed to work, Mr Punt said he performed the Heimlich manoeuvre - a series of abdominal thrusts designed to dislodge foreign bodies from the airways. At this point, the female passenger vomited and regained a pulse. The pilot then put out a call to ask if there were any doctors or other medically trained passengers on board. 'When no one came forward I continued to assess and monitor the lady's condition,' Mr Punt said. 'She was in and out of consciousness for the rest of the flight to Abu Dhabi and there was talk of diverting the flight. 'We eventually made it to our destination and the lady was taken away by the medical team who were waiting for her on our arrival.' Etihad Airways thanked Mr Punt for his 'timely and unconditional help' in aiding a passenger who was unwell . Mr Punt had recently completed what is known as  First Person On Scene training, as part of his job as a firefighter. This type of training is given to emergency services workers, such as police officers and community first responders, to provide them with skills and knowledge to enable them to carry out immediate care in the first moments of an emergency. 'Having to deal with this incident certainly highlighted the importance of the training,' he said. Three weeks after the event, which occurred on August 8, Neil received a letter from Etihad Airways thanking him for his assistance. In the letter, Guest Affairs Officer for Etihad Airways, Faiza Abdul Rahim, wrote: 'On behalf of Etihad Airways I would like to express our sincere gratitude for the assistance you rendered to one of our guests who required medical attention. 'The medical aid you gave may have helped to avoid what could have been a potentially unpleasant situation for the guest and we gratefully acknowledge your timely and unconditional help.'","Neil Punt, from Somerset, stepped in when a passenger fell unwell .

"There were some anxious moments for passengers when an El Al Airlines plane carrying nearly 200 people was forced to make an emergency landing on just one engine on Saturday night. One of the Boeing 767-300 aircraft’s engines malfunctioned shortly after it departed Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv while en route to Toronto’s Pearson International Airport.

"Couples hoping a dream holiday will fix their broken relationship should think again. In fact, it's likely to lead to more rows, according a new survey. Nearly a third (27 per cent) of divorced Brits said they decided to split up within weeks of returning from a tumultuous holiday. And for one in 10 couples a 'make or break' trip will actually be what prompts their divorce, found the research, conducted by family law firm Slater & Gordon. Many couples felt that a chance to escape the woes of the daily grind would help them fall in love again . Despite getting away from everyday pressures, 'band aid' holidays often actually caused couples to argue more, it suggested. Six out of 10 couples who thought it might help them through a rocky patch found it didn't work, according to the survey of 2,128 married and divorced Britons. The survey revealed that going on a summer break is often the last  attempt for  couples in crisis, with almost 40 per cent admitting they had gone on holiday in an attempt to save their marriage. Many couples felt that a chance to escape the woes of the daily grind would help them fall in love again. Make or break holidays: Forty per cent of Britons felt that trips away put a strain on their relationship . But in reality, the pressure of spending time alone together turned out to be the catalyst for 15 per cent of warring couples to realise they weren't in love, and the same proportion not talking to each other during the trip at all. Forty per cent of Britons felt that holidays put a strain on their relationship and 28 per cent claimed they had split up with someone on holiday. And nearly one in ten said they avoided their partner to relieve the tension, while eight per cent of those surveyed even ended the holiday early. One in twenty holidaying couples even said they used the break to discuss getting a divorce. Not all doom and gloom: Thirty-six per cent of couples surveyed said a holiday had saved their marriage . But it was not all negative with 36 per cent saying that the holiday saved their marriage. Amanda McAlister, head of family law at Slater & Gordon, said: 'One of the fundamental issues is that a holiday environment is essentially an artificial one and the problems that couples have will still be there when they return home. 'It takes more than a week in the sun to fix deep rooted problems but by taking the holiday and doing everything you can to save a marriage it means that even if a couple does decide to divorce it can often been done more amicably and without a lengthy court battle. 'This is because neither party will feel like the other hasn't tried to fix the problems and both parties will normally have come to a mutual decision on the end of the marriage.'","A third of  Britons split for good within weeks of returning from a holiday .

"So you are at the airport waiting excitedly to board the plane and jet off on your holidays. But suddenly the departure board is showing that your flight is delayed. Worse still, it then changes to read 'cancelled'. Don't just groan and put up with it. Under EU law, in many circumstances airlines have to provide passengers with food, drink and, in the case of a long delay, accommodation, plus compensation. But all too often, airlines are unforthcoming about your rights – so it really pays to know what they are. This six point guide should help. Read the signs: Passengers have more rights than they often appreciate when it comes to air travel . 1. Get familiar with Regulation EC 261/2004 . It sounds dull as ditch-water, and won't be trending on Twitter any time soon. But this is the key piece of EU law that covers passengers' rights when flying. Having some understanding of it may deliver you anything from a free meal to a payout of hundreds of pounds. If your flight is cancelled or delayed by at least two hours, then, under EU rules, airlines must provide - at the airport - a written summary setting out the rules for assistance and/or compensation. However, this does not always happen. Whether or not the airline tells you about your rights, do also look on the Civil Aviation Authority's website (www.caa.co.uk). In the Passengers section, under Resolving Travel Problems, you will find chapter and verse about your rights when facing a delay or cancellation. Important note: the regulation does not apply to any flight you might make. It covers those departing from airports in the European Union irrespective of the airline (so all ex-UK flights), and flights to EU airports which are operated by EU-based airlines. Although Iceland, Norway and Switzerland are not in the EU, the rules apply to them too. Don't take it lying down: All flights departing from EU airports are covered by European legislation . 2. You may be entitled to assistance . Depending on the length of your delay and flight, airlines have to provide - for free - means of communication (eg phone calls), a reasonable amount to eat and drink (usually covered in the form of vouchers), and, for overnight delays, hotel accommodation and airport-hotel transfers. These rights kick in when the delay is over two hours on short-haul flights up to 1,500km, more than three hours on flights 1,500km-3,500km, and over four hours on longer flights. Crucially, airlines must provide this help whatever the cause of the delay. If your airline does not cough up and you incurred costs, keep the receipts, and contact the airline later to make a claim. 3. You may also be entitled to compensation... ...but only if the flight arrives at least three hours late, or it was cancelled, and the airline was at fault. However, there is a sizeable catch. If the airline can prove that 'extraordinary circumstances' beyond its control were at play, such as as bad weather, air traffic control problems or security issues, then it does not have to cough up. A technical problem with the aircraft can also fall under 'extraordinary circumstances' - but not if it should have been picked up by routine maintenance. Compensation amounts are fixed – from €250 (around £210) to €600 (£504) per person – and determined by the length of flight and delay. Importantly, you can claim for a delayed or cancelled flight that you took in past years (in theory back to as long ago as 2005). Somewhere to turn? Flights outside the EU are less protected - but passengers still have considerable rights . 4. Watch out for changes to EU rules . In June, the European Parliament may refine some of the rules. It is likely that compensation only will apply for short-haul flights delayed by a minimum of five hours, or nine or 12 hours on longer journeys. On a more positive note, passengers' rights when stuck sweltering in a plane going nowhere on the tarmac look set to improve. 5. Your rights on flights not covered by the EU regulation are much more limited . Usually, you will be at the mercy of the terms of your contract with the airline. If you are flying with a reputable airline, you can expect refreshments and hotel accommodation when severely delayed, but compensation is very unlikely. Your travel insurance is likely to give some cover for long flight delays, but amounts are small: typically £25-£50 for a delay of over 12 hours. 6. Consider getting help to enforce your rights . Recent clarifications about the EU rules and what constitutes 'extraordinary circumstances' have meant that more passengers are receiving the compensation they are entitled to. However, many airlines will often try their utmost to avoid paying up, so you need to be prepared for a battle. First step is to put in a claim against the airline. The CAA's website (www.caa.co.uk) has detailed information on how best to go about making a claim, and has a template claims letter that you can download and send. If you get nowhere with the airline, the CAA may be able to look in to your case.","Passengers have more rights than they know when it comes to air travel .

"Malta is a small island - and Valletta is the smallest capital in the EU. But now the former British colony is getting a planet-sized chunk of attention. Later this month, the Duchess of Cambridge will represent the Queen on her first official overseas trip without Prince William (or Prince George) to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Maltese independence. Already the island has gone Kate-crazy. People could talk of little else as I travelled around Malta and its neighbour, Gozo. Scroll down for video .

The Maltese drive on the left, British phone and post boxes are everywhere, there's even a M&S in Valletta - and they still use three-pin electric plugs. What's more, Malta has been held in great affection by the Queen for nearly 70 years. Between 1949 and 1951, as Princess Elizabeth, she lived just outside Valletta, when Prince Philip was stationed there as a naval officer. Star attraction: Newly weds Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie took over the pebble beach of Mgarr ix-Xini in Gozo . Secluded spot: Brad and Angelina were in Gozo filming By The Sea, which was written by Jolie . Angelina travelled to Malta ahead of Brad, who was finishing some promotion work for his upcoming film, Fury . The links were strengthened during the war when the island came under Luftwaffe bombardment. It held out and was awarded the George Cross by George VI as a result. It's a pity the Duchess will be there for only two days - there's so much to see on these small, but fascinating islands. Malta is by far the larger of the two and the more crowded, while Gozo is the deserted, rural cousin. Do take the regular 25-minute ferry across the channel that separates the islands. Both are so rich in history that I swam off the golden-red sands of Ramla Bay, on northern Gozo, without realising its significance. Only later did I discover this was the beach where Odysseus, hero of Homer's Odyssey, was washed up, clinging on to a timber, the last fragment of his shipwrecked boat. He was given refuge in a nearby cave by Calypso, a drop-dead gorgeous nymph. He promptly hopped into bed with her. Calypso's Cave, on the hill overlooking the bay, was depressingly short on attractive nymphs. Back on Malta, Valletta was a delight. It's only a three-hour flight from London, but it feels tropical: a former British colony meets Italy meets Arab Africa. Sicily is only 50 miles north; Tunisia 176 miles west.

All that glitters: St John's Co-Cathedral is a blingy series of gilded rooms, studded with baroque monuments . The city is built on a grid, like an early Manhattan, but there are no skyscrapers and all but essential traffic is banned. At its heart is St John's Co-Cathedral, built by the Knights of Malta from 1573. The knights — from Italy, Provence, Auvergne and Aragon - competed to produce the most ornate chapels. The result is a blingy series of gilded rooms, studded with baroque monuments. The generous knights gave two Caravaggios, of St Jerome and The Beheading Of John The Baptist, to the cathedral. Both are still there. As a crucial naval port, Valletta once had a rackety side, concentrated on Strait Street, in the heart of the city.

"For the 55,000 brave aircrew who lost their lives in the Second World War, it would have been their final view of England, soaring high above the North Lincolnshire countryside. In tribute, one of the world's last two airworthy Lancasters takes the same route over Bomber Country - where some 389,000 sorties were flown by Bomber Command between 1939 and 1945. This moving footage is captured from a light aircraft flying alongside the 69ft-long Canadian bomber, flying in formation much how the legendary bombers would have done more than 70 years ago. Scroll down for video . 'We were incredibly close': A photograph taken of the Canadian Lancaster bomber from on board Action Station's Piper Chieftain . MailOnline was given exclusive access to film the Avro Lancaster Mk X, which this month made the 14-hour, 3,700-mile journey to Britain for the last time. The four-minute tribute video shows the bomber taking off from Humberside Airport, flying down to Lincoln Cathedral, then out towards the North Sea and over The Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Museum - home of the Avro Lancaster Just Jane. The Canadian Lancaster, with a magnificent 102ft wingspan, looks haunting and glorious, its distinctive markings shimmering in the sunlight, as the plane - one of the Second World War's most-recognisable British aircraft - powers across the blue sky. At one point, the two planes are so close to each other, the passengers in the light aircraft flying alongside are able to see the Lancaster pilot's face - and the dials on its dashboard. Phil Vinter, 36, from London, who shot the video for MailOnline, said: 'It was spectacular - the sun was shining on the Lancaster and it looked as awesome as you would expect. It was a fantastic sight. Incredible machine: The Canadian Lancaster as it flies above Britain, having made the journey across the Atlantic for the final time . Flying high: The spectacular footage captures the Lancaster gliding just metres away from Action Stations' Piper Chieftain . 'It was staggering just how close we were able to get. We were able to see right inside the cockpit - at times, you could see the pilot, and some of the dials on the dashboard. We were just metres away from each other. 'The noise was incredible as well - when you're on the ground, it's a unique sound and very different to modern aircraft. If you were living in the flight path to one of those, you would know about it. 'It's a very low but loud drone - very basey. You can just imagine that noise during the war - and the Lancaster being a very threatening device. 'As one of the world's only two remaining Lancaster bombers, to have the opportunity to see the plane that was so vital during the Second World War, the most significant aircraft helping the allies to win, to see one of these up close, the famous Dambuster plane, it was a really special moment. I feel very privileged.' Flight of a lifetime: The Canadian Lancaster bomber flies above the UK as MailOnline films footage from a light aircraft soaring just feet away . Journey of a lifetime: The Canadian Avro Lancaster made the flight to Britain for the final time to fly with the only other airworthy bomber in the world . Phil Vinter shot the footage of the incredible Canadian Lancaster bomber - flying just metres away in a twin-engine Piper Chieftain . More than 7,377 Lancasters, 430 of which were built in Canada, were built during the Second World War but many that survived were scrapped. It was the most successful bomber used by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force. In 1940, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill threw his support behind the Royal Air Force's Fighter Command and the development of Bomber Command, stating: 'The Navy can lose us the war, but only the Air Force can win it. Therefore our supreme effort must be to gain overwhelming mastery in the air. 'The Fighters are our salvation, but the Bombers alone provide the means of victory.' The Lancaster Vera - dedicated to Andrew Mynarski, the last Canadian airman to be awarded the VC in World War II – made the long journey to Britain from its base at the Ontario's Warplane Heritage Museum earlier this month. It has joined the Lancaster Thumper at various events over the past few weeks - marking the first time the two Bombers have flown together in 50 years. The two aircraft are expected to visit some 60 air shows and public events across the UK over the next five weeks. They took to the skies over Eastbourne last week - joined by jet planes from the Red Arrows. The Lancasters, made famous by the Dambusters raid, took part in a flyby over Eastbourne beach along with a Spitfire and a Hurricane as part of a tour to commemorate the Battle of Britain.

The Lancaster Thumper, flying as part of the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, was joined by the Canadian Lancaster Vera from Ontario . Action Stations is arranging flights alongside the Canadian bomber, with seats available for a final trip on September 8, for £2,150. The price includes a 40-minute flight - flying alongside the Lancaster for about 30 minutes - as well as a tour of the plane and a photo opportunity. Stephen Burt, CEO of Action Stations, said: ‘We offer these flights to ensure the memory of those aircrews who gave of themselves in our hour of need, is never forgotten. ‘We can appreciate and enjoy the aircraft that are kept in museums, but it is only when they are fired up and flying that these legendary machines capture the attention and imagination of all.

The Lancaster from The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight which flew with the Canadian Bomber in formation for a public display . On May 16, 1943, 19 aircraft set out to destroy three dams in the Ruhr valley - the Mohne, the Eder and the Sorpe. The idea was to damage a vital source of power to the key industrial area of Germany. The strategic targets not only supplied hydro-electric power, and water for steel-making, but also supplied drinking water. The squadron was assembled by Wing Commander Guy Gibson with only 11 weeks to prepare for their mission - using special bouncing bombs, invented by Barnes Wallis. They were not told that they would be bombing the Ruhr valley until six hours before the raid began, following weeks of practice over Peak District reservoirs. On the night of the mission - codenamed Operation Chastise - the 113 crewmen took off in three waves along two different routes to bomb the dams. Gibson attacked first at the Möhne at 12.28am, but five bombs were dropped before it was breached. The first wave’s three remaining aircraft with bombs then attacked the Eder which finally collapsed at 1.52am. Aircraft from the other two waves bombed the Sorpe but it remained intact. Although the mission was hailed a success, eight aircraft and 53 crew were lost during the raids. ‘And if the story of the heroism of those people is to be passed on to future generations, it will be through the regular flying of these aircraft - their sight and sound will inspire future generations.’ The Avro Lancaster is one of the Second World War's most-recognisable British aircraft. It is most famous for the Dambusters raids, which saw 19 Lancasters attack German dams with Sir Barnes Wallis's 'bouncing bombs' in 1943. Vera - built two years after the raids, in 1945 - was acquired by Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in 1978 and underwent a 10-year restoration. Lord Of The Rings director Peter Jackson has also been on board the bomber in preparation for a new film about the Dambusters. The footage was filmed and edited by Phil Vinter with assistance from Andrew Panton for MailOnline.

Once in a lifetime: The trip to Britain marks the final time the Lancaster flies from Canada to England . Honoured: Andrew Mynarski was the last Canadian airman to be awarded the Victoria Cross in the Second World War . 'Probably the most famous Allied bomber of the Second World War, the Avro Lancaster had impressive flying characteristics and operational performance,' the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum says on its website. The plane is dedicated to the memory of Pilot Officer Andrew Mynarski who was awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest award for bravery in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Canadian Mynarski won the award on June 13, 1944, when his Lancaster was shot down in flames by a German night fighter during the Second World War. As the bomber fell, Mynarski managed to free the tail gunner trapped in the rear turret of the blazing and out-of-control aircraft before he died. The crew member survived and lived to tell the tale, resulting in the Victoria Cross being awarded in 1946 - the last such award to a Canadian airman in the Second World War. The Lancaster bomber, which is flying to the UK in August, was dedicated to Mynarski, and is referred to as the 'Mynarski Memorial Lancaster'. It is painted in the colours of his aircraft KB726 – VR-A, which flew with RCAF Squadron. Unique opportunity: The passengers will fly alongside the most famous Allied bomber of the Second World War . In 1952, it suffered a serious accident and received a replacement wing centre section from a Lancaster that had flown in combat over Germany. It served as a maritime patrol aircraft in Newfoundland for many years and was retired from the RCAF in late 1963. With help from the Sulley Foundation in 1977, it was acquired from the Royal Canadian Legion in Goderich, Ontario, where it had been on outside display. Eleven years passed before it was completely restored and flew again on September 24, 1988.","MailOnline was granted exclusive access to film while flying alongside the Canadian Lancaster bomber .

"For years, Ulrika Jonsson has been lumbered with the scornful nickname 4x4, for giving birth to four children by four different fathers. But the former weather presenter announced today that she has now become a 4x3 after her most recent husband Brian Monet adopted her eldest daughter Bo, 13. Ulrika, 47, took her whole family to Oxford County Court earlier this month to witness a judge hand over a certificate officially naming Brian as Bo's father. Scroll down for video . Ulrika with her daughter Bo and husband Brian Monet, who has recently adopted Bo as his own . She told The Sun: 'When the judge granted the order, Brian and I wept. We rushed home to tell Bo, who was so happy. 'It is hard to put into words what this means to us, now Bo has someone who has truly earned the right to be her father. 'You can never expect someone to love your children unconditionally as you do yourself, but Brian does. 'Nothing has changed in our day-to-day lives but deep down there is such contentment, a relief on my part and reassurance for Bo, our family is stronger than ever.' Bo's biological father is the German hotel boss Markus Kempen, who Ulrika dated for a short while at the turn of the century. Ulrika Jonsson with her husband Brian and three of her children Bo (left), Martha (centre) and Cameron (right) But just days after Bo was born in November 2000, the businessman told his girlfriend that he was leaving the UK to find work abroad - Ulrika hadn't even taken their child home from the hospital by then. When four years later, Ulrika met her current husband Brian, the American advertising executive raised Bo as if she were his own. But until now, the family haven't seen fit to make the relationship legal. The wheels only started to be put into motion when the teen approached her mother last autumn and asked if she thought Brian would be interested in adopting her. According to Ulrika, Brian was so touched that he started to cry. The couple then had to start the exhausting adoption process through social services, that included witness statements, referees, visits to their home and the agreement of Bo's biological father Marcus.

Then, almost nine months after the procedure began, a judge granted the order and Bo now goes by the name Bo Jonsson Monet. It is a happily ever after ending for Ulrika, who has until she met Brian was always unlucky in love. In 1990, she married cameraman John Turnbull in 1990 and four years later they gave birth to Ulrika's eldest son Cameron, now 19, but the couple then divorced a year later. Her next serious relationship was with the footballer Stan Collymore, which ended with him violently assaulting her in 1998 after they started arguing in a bar in Paris. It was soon after this that her romance started with Bo's father Marcus Kempen, which ended shortly after Ulrika gave birth.

In between this split and meeting her third husband, Ulrika then engaged in a brief relationship with Sven-Göran Eriksson while he was manager of the England football team.

Sadly, the couple split a year later but Lance continues to have a good relationship with his daughter, with Ulrika describing Martha as the apple of his eye. Then finally in 2006, Ulrika met Brian Monet and they were married in March 2008, with her fourth child Malcolm born three months later in June of that year. While the TV star has now spoken of her joy that her daughter Bo has been officially adopted by Brian and announced that she is now a 4x3 instead of a 4x4, she has always been very outspoken about the attitudes the general public has to her family situation.

She told The Mail in 2011: 'Being labelled a 4x4 does not bother me in the slightest, but the chances are you are not going to believe me. 'Truth is, when it first emerged that I was expecting my fourth child by as many men three years ago, I had to admit to myself that the branding was not only innovative but rather apt. 'It rolled off my thick skin like water off a pregnant duck's back. '(But) many cruel jokes and jibes later I am still questioning why my domestic situation has been the subject of so much vitriol and disapproval. 'After all, plenty of men - many of them famous - father children by a host of different women, and they are treated like loveable, if randy, old goats. 'But women like me, whose romantic dreams may have fallen apart - but who work ferociously hard to provide stable loving homes for their offspring - are vilified. 'Functional, beautiful, well-adjusted children can come out of broken situations. And in my case it is thanks to the contributions made by the fathers who take the same responsibility as I have. So please save your criticism of the women who love and nurture their children and direct it at the men who fail to be fathers and prefer, instead, to play Father Christmas once a month. I have four fantastic children with three fantastic fathers.

"Arrested: The 35-year-old was detained at passport control in the capital's Jomo Kenyatta airport . Police investigating the Nairobi mall massacre are questioning a Briton arrested as he tried to fly out of the city after the attack. The 35-year-old was detained at passport control in the capital’s Jomo Kenyatta airport on Monday afternoon as he prepared to board a Turkish Airlines flight. His arrest came as Kenyan detectives investigated whether some of the terrorists from the Somali-based Al Shabaab militant group slipped out of the Westgate shopping complex amid the confusion, after switching their clothes with those of their hostages. The Briton, believed to be of Somali origin, attracted the attention of passport officers because of bruising to his face, his dark glasses and the fact he appeared to be acting suspiciously. Under questioning, he claimed the injuries happened during a recent visit to Somalia. But while his UK passport is said to be genuine, officials said he had no travel history in Kenya: he had a visa but there were no records of him arriving in the country. A Foreign Office spokesman said last night it was aware of the arrest and was providing consular assistance. MI5 and Scotland Yard are examining the records of Britons who travelled to Somalia and returned to the UK after training or contact with Al Shabaab amid fears they could be planning attacks in British cities. Up to 20 Britons – mainly of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and East and West African backgrounds – are thought to be in Somalia training or fighting alongside jihadists with the Al Qaeda-linked terrorists behind the mall atrocity. Kenyan foreign minister Amina Mohamed said yesterday that two or three Americans and a white British woman – suspected to be Samantha Lewthwaite, the fugitive widow of 7/7 bomber Jermaine Lindsay – were among the hostage takers. Operation: Smoke rises as Kenyan soldiers continue with a search and rescue operation at the Westgate mall . But they were not referred to directly by Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta last night during a TV address in which he said the terrorists had been ‘ashamed and defeated’. Five terrorists had been killed and 11 arrested while 61 hostages, including six Britons, and six security officers had been killed, the president said. He warned that the recovery of bodies would be hampered by the fact that three floors of the giant Israeli-run complex had collapsed. The five dead terrorists are said to be in the rubble, making early positive identification impossible. Announcing three days of mourning, he said: ‘As a nation our head is bloodied but unbowed . . . we have ashamed and defeated our attackers.’ Al Shabaab had earlier claimed its militants were still holed up in a mall and there were ‘countless dead bodies’, raising fears the death toll could rise even higher. Involved? Kenya's foreign minister said a white British woman - suspected to be Samantha Lewthwaite (pictured), the fugitive widow of 7/7 bomber Jermaine Lindsay - was among the hostage takers . The group said on its Twitter feed: ‘The . hostages who were being held by the Mujahideen inside #Westgate are . still alive, looking quite disconcerted but, nevertheless, alive.’ 'As a nation our head is bloodied but unbowed... we have ashamed and defeated our attackers' Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta . The arrest of a Briton and reports that . fighters from up to seven countries were among the terrorists threw a . new spotlight on the extraordinary recruitment and radicalisation . carried out on behalf of Al Shabaab, that has seen up to 200 people . travel from the UK to Somalia to train with the notoriously brutal . Islamists. So ruthless are some factions in the group that Britons who wanted to return home have been tortured while others have been held captive until their families have paid ransoms. BBC Panorama journalist Peter Taylor, who is making a programme about Al Shabaab recruitment, said yesterday he had interviewed two 16-year-olds who had been horrified at what they found in the camps. One was forced to watch the beheading of a deserter. Response: Kenya Defence Forces soldiers comb the rooftop of the Westgate mall in Nairobi yesterday . On its Twitter account, Al Shabaab has claimed that Americans, Syrians, Britons, Swedish and Finnish nationals, Canadians, French, Afghans and Pakistanis are among their fighters. 'Unfortunately they glamorise what it is to go to Somalia to fight and to die' FBI agent Kyle Loven . The terrorist group, which pledged its obedience to Al Qaeda and its head, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in February 2012, is fighting to impose a strict interpretation of Sharia law in Somalia. FBI agent Kyle Loven said investigators had worked with Somali community groups to try to stem the flow of young men being lured to fight jihad, but he warned that videos glorifying the war in Somalia were still a recruiting tool. He added: ‘Unfortunately they glamorise what it is to go to Somalia to fight and to die.’ Stuart Osborne, who was until recently Scotland Yard’s head of counter-terrorism command, said last night: ‘British involvement in Somalia and Al Shabaab has been going on for some years.’","Man, 35, detained at passport control in Jomo Kenyatta airport on Monday .

"The FA, faced with the new Wembley attracting its lowest crowd for an England international, have further antagonised the hardcore support base. Indeed, some fans who have bought tickets for Wednesday’s low-key friendly against Norway to secure loyalty points for Euro 2016 are threatening not to go to the match. This makes it even more likely the attendance will be significantly less than the 48,876 who watched a friendly against Sweden in 2011. Quiet night: Empty seats  in the Wembley stands during the friendly between England and Sweden in 2011 . Loyal fans, who watch the national team home and away, are annoyed that they have to buy seats for three Euro 2016 qualifiers at Wembley by Monday to qualify for their England Supporters Club £5 discount off the price of a home ticket. And the match against Lithuania is not being played until March 2015. This follows the FA offering members a £5 discount for the Norway game, only to drop the price to the general public by £10. The supporters club were already aggrieved by the FA moving double loyalty points from away match attendance to Wembley games to help fill the stadium during an ultra-dull Euro qualifying campaign. Fans spokesman Kevin Miles said: ‘The FA should be really careful at taking members club support for granted. The over-riding desire to fill Wembley cannot come at any cost.’ The FA insisted after a World Cup build-up during which Roy Hodgson’s England side spent just two full days at their £100million St George’s Park national training centre — isolated in the Staffordshire countryside near Burton — that it will be fully utilised by the senior team in future.

Supremos: UEFA president Michel Platini (left) stands alongside FIFA president Sepp Blatter in June . Platini is not expected to put himself forward, preferring to remain Europe’s football kingpin. So UEFA representatives, having been summoned to Europe’s most expensive location, will at least expect a full-on assault against FIFA’s dysfunctional governance when Platini speaks to the Press afterwards. This would follow on from the strong anti-Blatter mood — not least from the FA — within UEFA at the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo before the World Cup. Platini wants to make a landmark statement, but it is understood his advisors are urging caution. Balding blow for C4 . Clare Balding indicating she is unlikely to renew her £400,000-a-year contract to present 40 days of Channel 4 racing in 2015 really is the death knell for its doomed revamped racing coverage — a spectacular failure since the start of 2013. Having Balding on board was one of the main reasons why IMG were originally awarded the production contract. And her jumping ship from presenting her specialist sport is the clearest sign that the racing programming has not worked. Racing is lucky to have two specialist channels screening its meetings, so only the marquee occasions should be sold separately in future. And certainly Royal Ascot would love to be back on BBC.

No sooner had Kevin Pietersen failed for Surrey on T20 finals day than he was responding to tweets from Graeme Smith that suggest the cricket mercenary will play in South Africa’s Ram Slam T20 tournament in November.

"Clear: Terry Robinson survived two inquiries . Leicester City director of football Terry Robinson has survived inquiries by both his club and the FA over an alleged racist comment about a member of staff. It is claimed Robinson, a former FA international committee member and Sheffield United chairman, described a Leicester employee as a ‘darkie’ while in a group conversation at the training ground. There was enough concern around the club, including among some of the players when they found out about it, for the FA to be informed by a third party. The FA took the claim seriously enough to conduct a thorough inquiry. However, it was found there was no case to answer because none of those involved had made a complaint. Leicester conducted their own probe following the FA’s verdict and came to the same conclusion. A club spokesman said: ‘This matter was looked into in the correct way and there is nothing further to say.’ Robinson declined to comment on Tuesday . ......................................................................... David Gill’s decision not to stand for the British vice-presidency on FIFA’s executive committee gives the FA a golden opportunity to put forward a distinguished former player, rather than one of the suits on the FA Council. And with all 54 UEFA countries voting on the home nations’ position for the first time — and Michel Platini keen to promote ex-players — a popular English footballer would be a strong favourite to beat the time-servers due to be put forward by Wales and Scotland. Platini was responsible for the choice of former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, who was the most wooden presenter at the Champions League draw. Ironically broadcast journalist Pedro Pinto, who had smoothly hosted the previous eight draws when at CNN, is now Platini’s media adviser. Opportunity: David Gill's not to stand for the British vice-presidency at FIFA has opened a spot for an ex-player . MCC expect Sir Ian Botham, who is a much better speech maker than his Sky commentaries suggest, to be worth hearing when he delivers the 2014 Cowdrey Lecture at Lord’s on Wednesday. The talk is being relayed live for the first time on MCC’s YouTube platform. One of the biggest mysteries of transfer deadline day was a certain Jonathan Hope acting as spokesman on the progress of Danny Welbeck’s move from Manchester United to Arsenal. It certainly surprised both clubs and the Welbeck family, who represent Danny, as none of them had heard of him. The unlicensed Hope, a self-styled football broker working as a consultant for Revolution Sports Management in Glasgow, says he has no involvement with Welbeck but had put his name forward to Spurs and Newcastle trying to engineer a deal.

Got your number: Welbeck shows off his new No 23 shirt... but his family deny knowing Jonathan Hope . Sky deadline disaster . Sky Sports News are having to rethink their transfer deadline-day strategy after Monday’s chaotic coverage. This included numerous obscene comments from fans positioned behind Sky reporters around the clubs, sex toys being brandished on air at Aston Villa and Everton and a full-scale anti-Sky protest at Crystal Palace. The fall-out saw SSN boss Andy Cairns having to account to regulators OFCOM, who received eight complaints about foul language. The clubs are also increasingly concerned by Sky’s over-the-top grandstanding on the day.

"Surprising splits within UEFA now make it highly unlikely that the world’s most powerful football confederation will put up a candidate to stand against Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency. UEFA had insisted they would field a challenger even if Michel Platini decided, as he did in Monaco last week, to continue for another term as European football’s kingpin. But that ambition was defeated during a meeting of the 54 European countries in Monte Carlo when a number of delegates - notably from Finland and Iceland - made it clear they were happy with the way Blatter and FIFA were running the world game. VIDEO Scroll down for Sepp Blanters anti-racism rally . Unchallenged: With splits in UEFA it's unlikely the the confederation will put up a challenger for Sepp Blatter . Happy where he is: Michel Platini has confirmed he wants to stay head of UEFA and not challenge Blatter . Some of the Euro powerbrokers who might have put themselves forward were already disillusioned by what happened before the FIFA Congress in June. Then, the UEFA countries agreed to vote for age and term restrictions for the FIFA presidency but when the FIFA vote took place, only 33 of the 54 nations actually backed the limits. As a result, none of Europe’s big hitters would want to oppose Blatter when not even assured of full support within UEFA. Meanwhile, the sight of Platini chilling out at the beach bar at the Meridien Plaza in Monaco after completing his Champions League draw duties helped explain why he is content to run European football for another four years rather than dip his toe in the murkier Zurich waters. Trigger-happy Leeds owner Massimo Cellino is understood to have contacted Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid to ask about his assistant Paul Clement as a possible manager at Elland Road. However, the conversation didn’t last long after Cellino was told that Clement, who turned down West Bromwich, is earning nearly £2million a year in Spain.

Don't blink: Former England coach Martin Johnson makes brief appearance in an ER 2015 promo video . Sky Sport’s ludicrous hyping of presenter Jim White as the king of their transfer coverage was exposed in their deadline-day promo. It showed White supposedly taking a phone call from QPR manager Harry Redknapp, saying: ‘Harry - what have you got for me?’ The Redknapp camp understandably objected to Harry being presented as a prime source for White’s often wayward transfer gossip and the greeting was changed to ‘Hello - what have you got for me?’ Making deadline: QPR boss Harry Redknapp (right), with new signing Sandro (left), objected to Sky Sports News' use of his name in a Deadline Day promotion featuring Jim White . FA’s Burton U-turn . One upshot of the FA’s assessment of their World Cup debacle is a change of attitude over England’s use of St George’s Park before internationals. Instead of staying there before every game, which had been the plan, the senior team will now only be based at SGP when it suits, with the players not relishing the 130-mile journey from Burton to Wembley. So England will again stay at the Grove Hotel outside Watford before Wednesday’s friendly against Norway, prompting the question of why they built their £100m national training centre deep in the Staffordshire countryside. Sensible stay: Wayne Rooney (right) and Danny Welbeck (left) train at Arsenal's training base London Colney in north London rather than St George's Park 130 miles away ahead of England's friendly against Norway . Meanwhile, sports psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters cut a remote figure in Brazil - apart from helping to load baggage on to the bus - as England’s World Cup campaign unravelled. Yet Peters is staying on as part of Hodgson’s backroom staff when called upon. Stuart Pearce, who as England Under 21 manager failed to build a relationship with senior team boss Roy Hodgson, is having no such problems back in Nottingham. As well as guiding Forest to the top of the Championship, Pearce was called upon by Notts cricket chief and England selector Mike Newell to deliver a team talk before the county’s quarter-final against Derbyshire in the Royal London One-Day Cup. ‘Psycho’ concentrated on telling the cricketers to maximise their abilities, and Notts drubbed their local rivals by 85 runs.

"Samsung's Galaxy S2 Android touchscreen has sold 10 million units: Its successor is liable to be a showcase for Samsung's most hi-tech components . Samsung has officially confirmed the existence of the Galaxy S3 - the hi-tech follow-up to one of the most iconic Android smartphones. The phone will be unveiled at a special event early this year - and will be on sale shortly afterwards. The 'special event' approach is akin to Apple's glitzy iPhone launch events - and a new idea for Samsung. If Apple launches iPhone 5 this summer, as expected, the S3 is liable to be among its most heavyweight competitors in the second half of this year. 'The successor to the Galaxy S2 smartphone will be unveiled at a Samsung-hosted event in the first half of . the year, close to commercial availability of the product,' said the . Korean electronics giant in a statement. Technical specifications of the device haven't been released. Samsung's Galaxy series are traditionally used to showcase the most hi-tech components manufactured in Samsung's factories - and have been ahead of the components in Apple's iPhone. Samsung recently launched the Galaxy S Advance - a cheaper model of the hit handset with slightly less cutting-edge components. It's available now . The Galaxy S2 came out last August and was hailed as the ultimate geek's phone. It was fast and had a great camera. The Galaxy S3's spec has not been officially announced, but according to reports, here's what it might include... The Galaxy S2 was one . of the first handsets with a laptop-esque dual core processor, and . offered an eight megapixel camera months before Apple's iPhone 4S.Samsung still makes several components that are used in Apple's iPhones. Samsung's Galaxy S2 sold 20 million units at last . count. One in 10 of the whole Korean population owns an S2, and the phone  is still a cult favourite on tech sites. The S2 helped propel Samsung's smartphone sales past Apple's in the . third quarter of 2011. 'Samsung’s Galaxy lineup has been one of the most sought after smartphone lines worldwide,' says Boy Genius Report. 'The Galaxy S II became the company’s fastest selling smartphone ever, selling three million units in just 55 days.' 'Moreover, .

"Google’s increasing interest in sport will see England manager Roy Hodgson being interviewed in a live video call from their London headquarters this week. Hodgson will be joined by the other home nation managers — Scotland’s Gordon Strachan, Chris Coleman of Wales and Northern Ireland’s Michael O’Neill — in an initiative by Vauxhall, who sponsor all four countries, ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. Google are expected at least to consider the digital content in the next Premier League tender at the end of the year and are understood to be in the bidding for digital rights to major cricket tournaments. Promotion: Roy Hodgson will make his debut on Google+ along with Chris Coleman and Gordon Strachan . The FA have welcomed Hodgson’s debut on Google+ knowing they will need every possible media outlet to promote an unappetising set of Euro fixtures that follow on from a dismal World Cup. And before that, England are likely to attract their lowest crowd for an international at the new Wembley when they face Norway in a friendly on September 3. However, despite Germany also putting in a bid, Wembley remains the hottest of favourites to be awarded the final and semi-finals of Euro 2020 by UEFA on September 19. UEFA have again demonstrated how much they like England’s national stadium by choosing it to host a workshop for football media chiefs from across Europe the day after the Norway game, for which the 130 representatives could have a row each to watch from, let alone a seat. Barclays are not expected to renew their title backing of the Premier League after next season. But they have still decided, after many years, to revamp their judging panel for the Manager and Player of the Month awards, with old timers Gary Newbon and John Motson among those stood down. The winners used to be chosen quickly, followed by the longest of lunches at a private members club in London. Sky are leading the chase for Thierry Henry’s services if he retires at the end of the MLS season in October. Arsenal’s record goalscorer, who made a big impression as an analyst for the BBC during the World Cup, has still to decide whether to hang up his boots with the New York Red Bulls. If Henry  does, Sky head a queue that includes BT Sport and beIN Sports.

An intriguing new name has emerged as a possible challenger for the FIFA presidency if UEFA chief Michael Platini declines to stand against Sepp Blatter next year. Platini will announce his decision after consulting his UEFA colleagues in Monaco on August 28, but the odds are against him wanting to take on Blatter. In that case, UEFA will put up Holland’s Michael van Praag or even pledge support for another potential election runner, US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati. The combative Gulati sits on FIFA’s executive committee and has been an outspoken critic of the way Blatter runs FIFA since Qatar beat the USA to host the 2022 World Cup. Major rivals: Sepp Blatter will face competition to hang on to his title of president of FIFA . There is a strong desire among ECB directors for chairman Giles Clarke to reveal his plans ahead of the appointment of the next chief executive. Clarke may stand for another term in 2015, split the chairmanship between international and domestic affairs with Yorkshire’s Colin Graves, or concentrate entirely on ICC business. Whatever Clarke’s ambitions, his fellow powerbrokers want him to declare his hand, while the incoming CEO will surely be keen to know his intentions before signing a contract.","The England boss will make his debut on Google+ later this week .

"Sadistic Amon Goeth was believed to have been executed in a filmed hanging but now historians say it was a different Nazi butcher . Revelations about the execution of a notorious Nazi war criminal, immortalised in Schindler's List, have raised questions about how the mass murderer died and whether he was even hanged at all. For decades Amon Goeth, who was responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Jews and Poles during World War Two, was believed to have been filmed being executed in 1946. A black and white video shows executioners twice botching a hanging before he was eventually killed. But historians claim in a new  National Geographic . documentary called Bloody Tales that the video . was from 1947 and shows Dr Ludwig Fischer being hanged. Worryingly, there is almost no detail about the sadistic mass murderer's death in official records and no one knows what happened to his body. Historian Dr Suzannah Lipscomb and presenter Joe Crowley do not believe he escaped Europe like other high profile Nazis such as Adolf Eichmann and Joseph Mengele, and say he was killed. However the revelations surrounding Goeth, who was . known to carry out his own killings rather than order them, mean his death is now a . complete mystery with records containing just two words: 'He died.' Dr Lipscomb said: 'We are pretty sure that he was executed. On some level there will be speculation but if it was a court of law it would be concluded beyond reasonable doubt. 'He was a truly horrific individual.' Scroll down for video . Goeth was arrested in 1945 after German forces fled Poland and was handed over to the Polish authorities . The new documentary says the infamous video shows the botched execution of Dr Ludwig Fischer in 1947 and not Amon Goeth, a year earlier, as has been believed for decades . She said she hoped the information would inspire other researchers to now try to find out more about what happened to his body. David Caldwell-Evans, documentary . director, said a . combination of inaccurate records and the internet has perpetuated the myth that Goeth was in the video of the execution. He said: 'We know he was executed and . there was one unconfirmed account that said the executioners struggled . because of Goeth's height. 'There is no record of where he was . buried, he could have been cremated and had his ashes thrown in the . river or his body could have been donated to a medical school. We just . don't know. 'With Goeth, he acted alone so we thought there may be records and reports of his death but there is nothing. The only record left about the execution of Amon Goeth, who enjoyed killing people himself rather than ordering their deaths, is a note saying 'he died' 'He actually killed people himself, the war helped him exact his psychopathic tendencies.' Goeth was chillingly portrayed by British actor Ralph Fiennes in the Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning masterpiece Schindler's List. The Polish State Film Archive, the . Yad Vashem Holocaust Archive in Israel, Goeth's biographer and numerous . online holocaust sites identified the man being hanged as Goeth. Goeth, the Kraksow-Plaszow concentration camp commander in Poland, was convicted of killing tens of thousands of Jews in 1946. He was known to shoot babies for fun and got an extra kick when victims died slowly and painfully. Goeth was chillingly played by Ralph Fiennes in the Oscar-winning classic  Schindler's List in 1993 . In Schindler's List Ralph Fiennes' Goeth is seen being hanged, pictured, after giving a Nazi salute but historians say very little is known about the actual execution and what then happened to the body . As well as killing Jews and Poles, . Goeth also stole from them for his personal gain. At his trial he was found guilty of ordering up to 8,000 inmates to be exterminated, killing 2,000 more by closing the Krakow ghetto, and ordering the murder of several thousands more by closing down the forced labour camp at Szebnie. Survivors told of the horror of living under Goeth's command and testimonies said that he took a personal interest in the murder of prisoners. He would often set dogs on prisoners, who would eat them alive, before Goeth personally shot them but only when they stopped moving. Prisoners were counted lucky if they survived for more than four weeks. In 1943 on Yom Kippur, Goeth and SS officers shot 50 Jews and prisoners were regularly hanged in front of others. Schindler Jew Moshe Beijski's testimony at the trial of war criminal Adolf Eichmann is quoted on the Auschwitz website: 'The case of Olmer, whose daughter lives in Jerusalem, and I know her .. He was summoned by the Camp Commandant Amon Goeth. 'The Camp Commandant had two dogs, Ralf and Rolf, and he set the dogs on him. The dogs ate him up alive. Possibly a little breath still remained in him. He shot him and he was killed.' In another testimony, an older man received a beating and was then made to thank Goeth for it. When he turned to leave, he was shot in the back. At Plaszow, Goeth spent the mornings using a high-powered rifle to shoot children playing in the camp. Documentary film director David Caldwell-Evans said Goeth, portrayed here by Fiennes, has been 'slightly forgotten' Schindler Jew Poldek Pfefferberg said: 'When you saw Goeth, you saw death.' Goeth was arrested by the Gestapo for theft in 1944 but charges were dropped as Germany faced defeat by the Allied Forces. He was arrested again in 1945, this . time by U.S. forces and put on trial in 1946 at the Supreme National . Tribunal of Poland in Krakow. Goeth was found guilty on September 5, 1946 and executed on the 13. Mr Caldwell-Adams added: 'The prison . record only says two words: ""He died"". The Polish archives have been 80 . per cent sure that it was him. 'We knew the WFDIF had the original . film and when we went to them they said the film on the internet was . theirs and they were 80 per cent sure it was Goeth. 'When you think about the end of the war, Poland was a mess. 'They weren't terribly concerned by . the accuracy of the records so the video may have just been dumped on a . table and mislabeled. 'The clip was later used in a documentary about Goeth and uploaded to YouTube and it has all perpetuated the myth. 'People in Krakow are aware of Goeth but he has slightly been forgotten. 'Schindler's List gave us a hero and a . villain, but without remembering the villain we can forget the hero and . what he fought against.' In Steven Spielberg's 1993 . masterpiece Schindler's List, Goeth was played by Ralph Fiennes - . winning a Bafta for Best Supporting Actor. Fiennes' portrayal led to . Goeth being named as the 15th biggest villain in movie history by the . American Film Institute. Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson, was named 15th top hero. Historians believe the video of the botched execution actually shows Dr Ludwig Fischer . Dr Ludwig Fischer was a Nazi lawyer, politician and war criminal, who was responsible for creating the Warsaw Ghetto. Born into a Catholic family, he joined the National Socialist party in 1926 and rose to the senior rank of Gruppenführer. He was elected to the Reichstag in 1937 - two years before the outbreak of World War Two. After the invasion of Poland in 1939, Fischer was appointed Governor of the Warsaw District and held the position until the withdrawal of German forces in January 1945. Fischer issues anti-Semitic laws and was responsible for mass executions, slave labour programmes and sending Polish Jews to concentration camps. He survived an attempted assassination attempt in 1944 before the Warsaw Uprising and was arrested a year later by the Allied forces and handed over the the Police authorities. He was tried before the Supreme National Tribunal and sentenced to death. Fischer was executed by hanging at the age of 41 on March 8, 1947, in Warsaw's Mokotów Prison.","Amon Goeth killed thousands of people as concentration camp commander .

"The FA are in the process of renewing a contract with bookmakers William Hill despite the considerable conflict of interest because of the blanket ban on gambling for anyone working in English football. William Hill were controversial £2.5million-a-year sponsors of England and the FA Cup when the deal was first signed in 2012 because of the regulations against footballers betting which have now been extended to worldwide restrictions on the whole football family. Yet the FA, who rule on gambling breaches, still intend to keep an official betting partner, with William Hill close to agreeing a new four-year deal for the next World Cup cycle. Woeful: England's disastrous World Cup has seen their sponsorship deal with William Hill slashed . However, the deal will be considerably less — around £1.5m annually — because the FA are in a weak negotiating position after such a woeful World Cup performance and players’ appearances being taken out of the rights because of the gambling implications. William Hill are also having to save significant amounts because of a new law which obliges them — along with other betting companies — to pay UK tax on their off-shore earnings which will cost them around £70m a year. The FA say a close relationship with a bookmaker helps them monitor illegal betting. But the new agreement has still to be rubber-stamped by the FA and William Hill boards. The upheaval at Crystal Palace includes ambitious chief scout Tim Coe leaving Selhurst Park to join Championship club Brighton, who have revamped their recruitment operation.

"If he had his way, Paul Ryan would have been attending the inauguration in a very different capacity - as the new vice president. Instead, the Republican representative was just another face in the political crowd on Monday and suffered the indignity of being loudly booed as he left the Capitol building in Washington D.C. The former VP hopeful said last week that we would attend the swearing-in ceremony of President Obama because it was his 'obligation'. Scroll down for video . Unimpressed: Republican representative Paul Ryan was booed as he attended Obama's inauguration on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol today . Lost the race: Ryan attends Obama's ceremonial swearing-in at the Capitol on Monday . The Congressman appeared to take the boos in his stride, conveying little reaction to the crowd's negative response during an otherwise upbeat day. According to conservative blog Red State, the booing was started by Dan Freeman, an attorney who works at the Department of Justice. Ryan earlier wrote a gracious message on his Facebook page where he addressed Obama's inauguration directly. He wrote: 'I congratulate President Obama on his inauguration, and I join the country in celebrating this American tradition. The president and I were political opponents. We had strong disagreements over the direction of the country - as we still do now. But today, we put those disagreements aside. Today, we remember what we share in common. 'We serve the same country, one that is still in need of repair - and is still the freest on earth. 'We serve alongside men and women from . both parties, who govern in good faith and good will. Finally, we serve . the same people, who have honored us with their charge. Defeated: Paul Ryan appeared with Republican colleagues to watch one-time rivals for the White House Barack Obama and Joe Biden being sworn in . Absence: Former presidential hopeful Mitt Romney was nowhere to be seen today and was believed to be at his family home in La Jolla, California . We may disagree on matters of policy. But today we remember why we take those matters so seriously - because we seek the public good. It’s our highest duty - one that we share - and one for which we’re grateful. I’m happy to mark this historic occasion - for the president and for the country. And I look forward to tackling the big challenges ahead.' Ryan's running mate Mitt Romney was . not at the inaugural ceremony on Monday. He was 3,000 miles from . Washington at his home in La Jolla, California with his family. Whether he watched the day's historic days is debatable although one former aide said it would be 'doubtful'. Second term: Barack Obama is sworn in as the 44th President of the United States today as wife Michelle and daughter Sasha and Malia look on . Pride: Joe Biden is sworn in as Vice-President today at the Capitol in D.C. The President savored his special day as hundreds of thousands of supporters gathered to witness his second inauguration, grinning as he waved enthusiastically to the crowds lining Pennsylvania Avenue. And in a moving display of his appreciation as he left his public swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol building early on Monday afternoon, he was seen pausing a moment to look back towards the crowds and reflect on the vast sea of people before him. 'I want to look out one more time because I'm not going to see this again,' he said quietly to someone next to him as he took in the spectacular view. Obama was sworn into office by Chief Justice John G. Roberts as the president's proud wife Michelle and two daughters, 11-year-old Sasha and 14-year-old Malia, looked on. Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic woman to sit on the Supreme Court, then swore in Joe Biden as Vice President.

"Ed Miliband will today tell voters he needs a decade in Downing Street as he puts the NHS, home ownership and higher taxes on the rich at the heart of Labour’s bid for power. The Labour leader will use his annual party conference address to set out his ‘ten-year plan’ for what he will call a ‘national mission’. He will claim that a new mansion tax on expensive homes would raise almost £2billion a year, which could then be ploughed into the health service along with £1billion from other tax rises. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband will outline his 'ten-year plan' in a speech at the Labour Party conference in Manchester tomorrow . The Labour leader will restate his plans to reintroduce the 50p tax rate for higher earners . Mr Miliband will also restate his determination to reintroduce a 50p top rate of income tax if he wins the General Election in eight months’ time. And he will make an audacious attempt to steal Margaret Thatcher’s vision of Britain as a property-owning democracy, setting a target to double the number of first-time buyers to 400,000 a year by 2025. The party says it will increase the number of homes being built to at least 200,000 a year by the end of the next parliament – although aides conceded that some would have to be built on greenfield sites. ‘That most British of dreams, the dream of home ownership, has faded,’ the Labour leader will say, adding: ‘Housing will be a top priority in our capital investment programme – because we need to start Britain building again.’ However, the most eye-catching announcement is expected to be billions of pounds more for the National Health Service. Labour’s proposed Mansion Tax would be imposed on properties worth more than £2million. The money raised used to be earmarked for the cost of reintroducing the 10p tax rate to help low earners. But yesterday shadow chancellor Ed Balls announced the 10p rate could be paid for by abolishing the married tax allowance, freeing up revenue from the Mansion Tax for other spending. Labour would introduce ‘bands’, similar to those used for council tax, with a higher charge on houses worth more than £10million. Mr Balls has insisted people trapped in expensive homes who have no access to savings will be protected from the charge. Mr Miliband, who was at the conference today alongside Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and deputy leader Harriet Harman, will claim that a mansion tax would raise almost £2billion a year . There is expected to be protection for people who do not have large savings or higher earnings, but who live in an expensive home. This is likely to apply to widows or families who have lived in the same property for many years. A ‘relief scheme’ which could include allowing those on modest incomes to defer payment until the property is sold. The mansion tax will also be ratcheted up on the most expensive properties, so the wealthiest pay most. Mr Miliband’s aspiration to increase home ownership is one of six ‘goals’ he would aim to achieve if he could have ten years in power. His plan to turn around Britain would also see Labour attempt to boost the number of apprenticeships to match the number of people going to university. Large businesses hiring foreign workers from outside the EU would be forced to take on young people as apprentices, as would every firm winning Whitehall contracts. Mr Miliband wants wages to grow at the same rate as the economy, he aims to halve the number of low-paid workers by 2025 and create a million ‘green’ jobs in environmentally-friendly industries over a decade. Something to smile about? Mr Miliband will set out to plans to build thousands of more homes and set a target of 400,000 new first-time buyers every year by 2025 . Large businesses hiring foreign workers from outside the EU would be forced to take on young people as apprentices under the Labour leader's 'ten-year plan' 1. GIVING ALL YOUNG PEOPLE A SHOT IN LIFE . Ensure as many school-leavers go on to apprenticeships as go to university. 2. TACKLING THE COST-OF-LIVING CRISIS . Help working families share fairly in the wealth of our country so, when the economy grows, the wages of everyday working people grow at the same rate. 3. RESTORING THE DREAM OF HOME OWNERSHIP . Meet demand for new homes for the first time in half a century – doubling the number of first-time buyers getting on to the housing ladder a year. 4. TACKLING LOW WAGES . Halve the number of people on low pay in our country, changing the lives of over two million people. 5. SECURING THE FUTURE . Create one million more high-tech jobs by securing the UK’s position as a world leader in green industries. 6. SAVING OUR NHS . Build a world-class, 21st century health and care service. With polls suggesting the Conservatives have extended their lead over Labour on the economy to 25 points, the widest margin since the days of Neil Kinnock, Mr Miliband will appeal to the country to ‘raise its sights’ beyond the need for further austerity, saying: ‘Can anyone build a better future for the working people of Britain? That is the General Election question.’ He will tell activists at the Manchester conference that people in Scotland voted for independence because they felt there was ‘nothing left to lose’, adding: ‘Our task is to restore people’s faith in the future. But the way to do it is not to break up our country. It is to break with the old way of doing things.’ He will go on to say: ‘I’m not talking about changing a policy, or a different programme. But something bigger: transforming the idea, the ethic, of how our country is run. ‘What people are saying is this country doesn’t care about me. Politics doesn’t listen. The economy doesn’t work. And they are not wrong. They are right. But this Labour Party has a plan to put it right. ‘For Labour, this election is about you. You have made the sacrifices, you have taken home lower wages year after year, you have paid higher taxes, you have seen your energy bills rise, you have seen your NHS decline, you know this country doesn’t work for you. We can build that better future for you and your family, wherever you live in the United Kingdom, and this speech is about Labour’s plan to do it: Labour’s plan for Britain’s future.’ However Conservative sources said Mr Miliband’s ‘six-point plan’ was Labour’s seventh such effort in the last three years. And Mark Littlewood, head of think-tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ‘Introducing a mansion tax would be poorly targeted, arbitrary and deeply unfair. A person’s assets do not always equate to their income. ‘Evidence has also proven that their favoured 50p top rate of income tax raises trivial amounts of money. Pouring extra money into the NHS, at the expense of those who already contribute a great deal is not the solution to the failings of our health system.’ Labour would abolish the Government’s flagship migration target if it wins power next year, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said last night. Miss Cooper said the target would be replaced by ‘different controls’ to distinguish between asylum seekers, low-skilled workers and students.","Ed Miliband will outline his 'ten-year plan' for the UK in a speech tomorrow .

"What is it about Michael Gove that makes him attract controversy like a ripe peach attracts wasps? After that bruising bout of infighting with Theresa May over the threat of Islamic extremism, most ministers would have thought it wise to keep their head down. How Mrs May must be enjoying the sight of her adversary becoming embroiled in another unnecessary and bloody fight – this time involving the Prime Minister. Dominic Cummings, pictured, is seen as Michael Gove's closet ally and for many he is the Education Secretary's attack dog, savaging opponents . Many Tory MPs think it is inconceivable that the Education Secretary did not know Dominic Cummings was giving a poisonous interview to the same newspaper that two weeks ago reported his own withering criticism of the Home Secretary – and that Gove himself once worked for. Gove’s staff insist the first he knew was when a copy of the early edition was emailed to him on Sunday evening. Despite such denials, Gove’s enemies – and some of his admirers – suspect he was in cahoots with Cummings and will not be displeased by the political fallout, even though it is damaging the Tory Party. One backbench MP said: ‘I suspect this is Gove’s way of making public his concerns that his civil servants are against him and that he is not being supported by officials in No10.’ As an attack dog who was fiercely loyal to Gove when they worked together, Cummings is now widely seen to be continuing to voice what Gove can’t be seen to say himself. If this is the case, it’s a very dangerous path for Gove to tread. Mr Gove, pictured arriving at 10 Downing Street, denied any prior knowledge of his former special advisor's latest attack on the Education Secretary's cabinet colleagues, including Prime Minister David Cameron . What’s more, the vitriol continues to flow, with Cummings following his newspaper interview in which he accused the Prime Minister of governing by chasing headlines, by publishing a blog against the PM’s policy on the EU. It read: ‘Our approach to the EU – whining, rude, dishonest, unpleasant, childishly belligerent in public while pathetically craven in private, and overall hollow – fits the pattern.’ The behaviour of ‘officials in No10’ over Iraq came in for criticism, too. The two aides he pointed the finger at are Ed Llewellyn, the PM’s Old Etonian chief of staff, and Craig Oliver, Cameron’s communications chief. He had already told the Times he thought both men were ‘far out of their depth’. The problem for the Tory party is that Cummings’ views are shared by many backbench MPs who agree with his assessment of Cameron’s No10 team. Downing Street concedes Gove cannot – or will not – control Cummings, who quit as his special adviser in January. One senior Tory said: ‘Gove would rather he did not have these periodic eruptions. They do not help. But Cummings is on a crusade to improve the way the Government runs things. Above all, he is enraged that the Civil Service is blocking Gove’s education reforms and hopes by speaking out he will shame No10 into giving Gove the support he needs. ‘Of course, Cummings once had his uses to No10. After he left his job with Gove, he described Nick Clegg as ‘self-obsessed, dishonest’ and a ‘revolting character’. Mr Cummings accused Mr Cameron, pictured, of 'governing by chasing headlines', however many back bench Tories privately agree with the controversial former advisor . While Gove would never use such language, his former aide was merely reflecting his – and many other senior Tories’ – deep dislike of Clegg. Indeed, it is his loathing of the Lib Dems that lies behind Cummings’ attack on Llewellyn and Oliver.He was furious that they never stood up against Lib Dem posturing which he felt was sabotaging Gove’s radical reforms. Cummings has trenchant views on how generations of children have been failed by Britain’s school system. His mother was a special needs teacher. After running a failing airline firm in Russia, he embarked on a political career and had an unhappy stint as director of strategy during Iain Duncan Smith’s ill-starred tenure as Tory leader. Tory Party historian Tim Bale said the then 30-year-old Cummings ‘got up the noses of traditionalists’ as he bemoaned the fact that the ‘modernising project was doomed to a series of half-measures and superficial initiatives.’ After Gove became shadow education secretary in 2007, he made Cummings his chief of staff. Immediately, Cummings locked horns with Andy Coulson, the then Tory communications chief, who did not like free-thinkers. When Cameron entered Downing Street, it was no surprise that Coulson blocked Cummings becoming an adviser to Gove. Yet when Coulson was forced to resign, Cummings was back. They may no longer be working together, but the pair share the same outlook and passion. Eccentric to the point of being slightly mad and with a shambolic dress sense, Cummings makes abstruse references from classical literature. Unlike most ministerial special advisers, he has no ambition for a career in frontline politics. With such an operator by his side, Michael Gove had a very powerful ally. But now he’s no longer a paid employee, Cummings is out of control. Naively, Cummings believes his latest intervention will persuade Cameron to give Gove more support.But he risks driving a wedge between them. Then, not only would Michael Gove find himself marginalised, but he might easily lose his job in a reshuffle.","Many Tory back benchers secretly agree with Dominic Cummings' analysis .
Michael Gove said he was unaware of Mr Cummings' latest broadside .
Mr Cummings is still seen as very close to his former boss, Mr Gove ."
"For Arsenal to pick up four Premier League points despite not playing particularly well in their first two games of the season is a positive. But surely Arsene Wenger has seen by now that if Arsenal are to achieve the standard of modern big clubs – Champions League and Premier League success – Per Mertesacker just isn’t up to it. Just look at what happened in Brazil in the summer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Mertesacker take part in funny challenges with team-mates . Struggle: Per Mertesacker battles with Romelu Lukaku at Goodison park on Saturday . Toil and trouble: Mertesacker feels the heat and is booked (right) on a chastening evening for the defender . Germany were looking far from convincing at the World Cup as the quarter final stage approached. Indeed, their game with Algeria was an epic largely because of the Germans’ atrocious defending. Mertesacker was subsequently dropped and Germany kept a clean sheet against France, going on to win the tournament. Fair play to Joachim Low for showing Mertesacker the respect his 100+ caps warrants by putting him on for the final few minutes of the final at the Maracana – a touch of class. The truth might hurt, but Mertesacker’s flaws are obvious. And Arsenal fans saw him struggle again at Goodison Park on Saturday. If he were English, he would be getting absolutely hammered by everyone right now. Mertesacker has had a great career, with lots of international caps, but it must hurt that after several near-misses – semi finals and a final – Germany only crossed the line and won a major tournament after he was eventually dropped. I’m afraid it looks like a pattern Arsene Wenger will have to copy, if he’s got the guts to do it. Mertesacker has won over the fans at the Emirates over by berating team-mates who he feels aren’t doing their best for Arsenal. Remember him scolding Mesut Ozil and jabbing his finger towards his fellow German’s face for not applauding the travelling Gunners fans after the 6-3 defeat last season. Fans love that sort of thing, but observers can see through the chest-beating, badge-kissing exhibitionism for what it is. Maybe Ozil should have been at the front of an orderly queue to berate Per on Saturday after Steven Naismith’s goal. What do Arsenal want to achieve? They don’t want to just win the FA Cup – they want to win the title after 10 years in the Premier League wilderness, and they want to win the Champions League. They can’t do that with Mertesacker at the back. It’s a tough thing to say about a guy who seems like a decent guy, and probably plays to the best of his ability. But can the Gunners afford to carry him on their journey back to the top of the English game while they explore unchartered territory for Gooners in Europe? Losing the battle: Steven Naismith gets the better of Mertesacker at Goodison . Glory: Mertesacker was part of the Germany squad that won the World Cup in Brazil . Truth hurts, but truth is Mertesacker isn’t good enough for what Arsenal want to achieve. Wenger can do the classy thing and follow Low’s lead – keep sticking the big flopping German on the bench week in week out, or stick him in the Gunnersaurus costume to give him time on the pitch at the Emirates. But as a first choice centre half at a top Premier League club, he’s doing a great job of making Igor Stepanovs look like Tony Adams. Auf Wiedersehen Per.

"England manager Roy Hodgson named his squad for the start of the Euro 2016 qualifiers  but has yet to explain to his employers why the World Cup campaign went so horribly wrong. But pressure from members of the FA board -concerned that such a dire performance would not receive the forensic post mortem it merited -has at least led to Hodgson meeting the FA directors to discuss France 2016 over two-and-a-half months on. Looking forward: Roy Hodgson has named his squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier with Switzerland . Summer of disappointment: England crashed out of the World Cup at the group stages . Hodgson is scheduled to talk to the board ahead of their September meeting when they will expect a full breakdown as to what can be put right ahead of Euro 2016. Subjects will include whether the 88-strong FA party was too big in Brazil and whether preparation was correct. Surprisingly -especially following a World Cup exit after just two games -there will be no official report but instead continuous assessment throughout the FA on what to put right. England will have either home or away fixtures against four European giants - Germany, Spain, France and Italy - over the next two years to help drum up backing for a national team to be watched by its lowest crowd at the new Wembley against Norway next Wednesday. FA general secretary Alex Horne called the expected crowd of between 35,000 and 40,000 ‘disappointing’ and added ‘there is some work to do’ re-engaging with disillusioned regulars. Spanish test: England will play Spain in a friendly - as well as Germany, France and Italy . One ambitious plan is to build a new fanbase by enrolling 500,000 football fans in the revamped England Supporters Club, despite current members being upset at the way they’re taken for granted. Not many sporting bodies have the resources to invite representatives from 54 territories to Europe’s most expensive playground Monaco for basically a vanity project announcement. But UEFA president Michel Platini put up all of Europe’s football powerbrokers in the Meridien Beach Plaza Hotel just to tell them during a brief 55-minute summit that he wouldn’t be standing against Sepp Blatter in the FIFA elections next May as widely predicted. Host: Michel Platini put up all of Europe’s football powerbrokers in the Meridien Beach Plaza Hotel . UEFA didn’t even put forward another candidate in the knowledge that Blatter, who has the support of the five other confederations, is certain to win a ludicrous fifth term. An expected attack on Blatter didn’t materialise, either, although Platini did tell his UEFA representatives on the FIFA ExCo not to be ‘sheep and say yes to the omnipresent Blatter all the time.’ The FA board have effectively acknowledged that referee grandee David Elleray receiving only a slap on the wrist for his ghastly racist comment — ‘You look rather tanned, have you been down a coal mine?’ — to an FA colleague sent out all the wrong signals for an organisation supposedly cracking down on all forms of discrimination. Wrong signals: The FA have effectively acknowledged their lenient treatment of David Elleray sent the wrong message . The protests -led by Sports Agenda -over Elleray’s ultra-lenient treatment have led to FA directors agreeing there should be an independent element to future investigations over code of conduct breaches, rather than the inquiry being conducted entirely in-house. Wembley Euro banker . The FA must believe UEFA awarding Wembley the final and semi-finals of Euro 2020 in Geneva on September 19 is a formality. The official FA party includes ineffective Minister for Sport Helen Grant and only a representative for London Mayor Boris Johnson. Grant wouldn’t even comment on England’s World Cup debacle, despite travelling on official business to Brazil. Meanwhile, the deep scars from the 2018 World Cup election fiasco — when the FA had PM David Cameron, David Beckham and Prince William in Zurich to secure just one vote from outside the UK — look to have healed. England are considering bidding for Euro 28 and believe hosting the Euro 2020 climax will not impact on that ambition. The Scottish FA are also hopeful the feelgood factor from Glasgow’s Commonwealth Games will help Hampden Park’s Euro 2020 cause, with Wales and Ireland expectant for the group stages as well.

"Bob Casale - the guitarist for iconic US band Devo, best known for the 1980 hit Whip It - has died of heart failure, his brother and band member Gerald Casale said Tuesday. He was 61. Devo founding member Casale said in a statement that his younger brother's death in New York on Monday was 'sudden"" and 'a total shock'.

"We’re nearly a month into the new Football League season so here are five things from outside the Premier League that have caught my eye so far… . 1) Cyrus Christie – the young right back has hit the ground running at Derby County after making the step up from League One Coventry City, his hometown club. He had been with the Sky Blues for 13 years so some early season 'homesickness' might have been understandable but he looks like he has been playing in the Championship all his life. after leaving Coventry (right) It’s thought Derby picked up him for a fee of around £100,000 after he ran his contract down – it’s a real bargain and I find it hard to believe no Premier League club took him. Makes you wonder how hard their scouts work. On his debut on the opening day of the season he provided the cross for the Rams’ winner against Rotherham, and four of the five Derby goals against Fulham on Saturday were started on the right. His attacking qualities are matched by his defensive ability. This kid is only 21 and on the evidence so far, he has got a massive future. At his current rate of progress he will be in the Premier League next season, either with Derby or somewhere else. 2) Graham Alexander – or as I always call him on talkSPORT, 'the excellent Graham Alexander.' One of the good guys of football was an exemplary professional as a player, and is now proving to be a quality manager at League One table-toppers Fleetwood. Quality: Graham Alexander is one of football's good guys and proving to be an excellent boss at Fleetwood . Fleetwood as a club have had a meteoric rise but in those promotion years they have been among the biggest spenders in each division. Chairman Andy Pilley estimates he has injected some £15million of his own money into the club during the years of success. But in League One, Fleetwood are no longer the biggest players. The likes of Bristol City, Sheffield United and Leyton Orient are all paying big wages, so it’s harder for Fleetwood to compete. So far Alexander is making it look easy. 3) With Ross Barkley out of the England picture, Roy Hodgson might be wondering who is going to create some magic for England. Who has got that unpredictable spark that the best England teams down the years have had? I doubt Hodgson will go looking in the Championship but if he did he would find such a player at Middlesbrough. Had Lee Tomlin been more disciplined – on and off the field - in his career, he would unquestionably have made it to the Premier League by now. Gem: If Lee Tomlin (right) had been more disciplined he could have been playing in the Premier League . He’s a clever player who can destroy teams on his day. He creates and he scores – he’s a perfect example of how a 'fantasy No 10' should play. He looks heavy but he is deceptively speedy, and runs as quick with the ball as without it, which not many can do. There is a Premier League tendency to dismiss the Championship as rubbish, but if you look carefully there are some gems. Tomlin is one of them, albeit a late developer. And let’s not forget, the Championship is where Barkley received a great education during a couple of loan spells, and it is a division that the likes of Adam Lallana, Gary Cahill and Leighton Baines have all passed through on their way to the top. There are some gems down there. 4) Bakary Sako was not expected to stay at Wolves when they dropped into the third tier of English football last year. But he did and they were comfortable champions in the end. Sako, a left-sided attacking midfielder with a real goal threat, was signed from St Etienne in 2012, and Wolves were then relegated in his first season. But Sako was brilliant in League One and is one of the main reasons Wolves have made such a great start to life in the Championship this season. Real threat: Bakary Sako has pace, power, scores goals and has been Wolves' star so far this season . Three years ago the Mali winger was second only to Balise Matuidi as St Etienne’s player of the season. Matuidi is now a regular fixture for Paris Saint-Germain and France, while Sako is working a tougher route to the top. With less than a year left on his Molineux contract it may come sooner rather than later. 5) On a rare Saturday off during an international weekend last season, I went to watch Stevenage vs Rotherham. A blond midfielder ran the game, scored a cracker and looked the part in a 3-0 win for the Millers. Ben Pringle has found the right club and the right manager in Steve Evans to harness his unquestionable talents, and that’s why he has already been linked with a Premier League club this season. Evans will do everything to stop his best player going to Hull City, though. Pringle is busy, always available for the ball, never hides, and works back too.

"Joe Hart has faced little competition for his England place since he took over the No 1 jersey in 2010. But that might be about to change. Saturday afternoon saw two England goalkeepers go head-to-head and both kept clean sheets. Fraser Forster for Southampton and Ben Foster for West Brom in a 0-0 draw on the south coast. In fact this also happened as recently as February when Manchester City were held goalless at Norwich with Hart in one goal and John Ruddy in the other. After being cruelly left at home in the summer, Ruddy is now in the Championship and seemingly out of the England picture for the moment. Lion-Hart: Joe Hart has been unchallenged as England's No 1 goalkeeper for some time . Contender: Ben Foster kept a clean sheet on Saturday as West Brom earned a point at Southampton . In the running: Fraser Forster has the chance to stake his claim by playing for Southampton in the top flight . So what of the other two? Foster is a Roy Hodgson favourite from their time together at The Hawthorns – why else would a player who deserted England, and before that failed to grasp a fantastic opportunity at Manchester United when Fergie gave him a chance, jump instantly to the No 2 spot with his country? Foster regularly makes some good saves for Albion, to be fair, but as we saw when he had a rush of blood and wrongly chose to race out to the edge of his box in the first-half on Saturday, he’s capable of a cock-up. Age isn’t on Foster’s side compared with Hart and Forster – even if he takes his game up a level it’s unlikely he will get a move to a top club in the Champions League at this stage of his career. Plenty to ponder: Roy Hodgson will soon select his squad for the first Euro 2016 qualifier with Switzerland . Goalkeepers' union: Foster and Forster embrace after Saturday's match ends in a goalless stalemate . Forster is a different case, and in many ways an unknown quantity. If Hodgson can ignore his bias towards Foster then the Southampton keeper has a chance of staking a claim of being the main challenger to Hart. Forster had largely been untested in the Scottish Premiership during his time with Celtic, but certain Champions League performances have made people pay attention, and persuaded Southampton to pay £10m for the big man from Hexham. I expect Forster to be given a busy time at Saints this season, and if he comes up with some stand-out, points-saving performances, he will be hard to ignore. Commanding: Hart comes out to punch the ball clear under pressure in Manchester City's 3-1 win over Liverpool on Monday night . Competition: Hart knows he needs to be on top form to keep Willy Caballero out of the City side . Hart needs to stay focused – something he didn’t do at the start of last season. He has Willy Caballero – a Pellegrini favourite – breathing down his neck at club level so he can’t afford to make mistakes. If his form slips, he’ll be left out at City in a heartbeat (excuse the pun). When he was dropped by Pellegrini last season, Hart kept his place in the England team. But only because there were no alternatives Hodgson could justifiably turn to. Forster is a serious alternative. He needs to have a big first season in the Premier League with Southampton.","Joe Hart has been unchallenged for some time as England's goalkeeper .

"Ed Miliband is preparing to announce an extra £1.7billion will be spent on the NHS, funded by a mansion tax on wealthy homeowners. The Labour leader is expected to use his speech to his party conference in Manchester to promise to ‘protect the NHS’. He will announce plans to make it easier to get a GP appointment, improving hospital services and repeal the Health and Social Care Bill to take lawyers out of ‘our hospitals’. Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to use his conference speech to promise to divert billions of pounds into the NHS . Details of exactly what the extra money will be spent on have not yet been announced. But at the weekend Mr Miliband said he wanted to ‘put the right values back at the heart of our NHS’. He revealed he was ‘deeply worried’ about what would happen to NHS funding in the next parliament, and vowed to ‘protect’ it. Labour’s proposed Mansion Tax would be imposed on properties worth more than £2million. The money raised used to be earmarked for the cost of reintroducing the 10p tax rate to help low earners. But today shadow chancellor Ed Balls announced the 10p rate could be paid for by abolishing the married tax allowance. He said in his conference speech: ‘How can it be right that the billionaire overseas buyer this year of a £140 million penthouse in Westminster will pay just £26 a week in property tax, the same as the average value property in that area?’ Mr Miliband has warned he is 'deeply worried' about the state of the NHS finances after the next election . Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham warned the NHS is a 'service on the brink', while shadow chancellor Ed Balls insisted the Mansion Tax was needed to ensure billionaire homeowners pay their fair share . Labour is determined to fight the next election on the NHS, claiming it is not safe in Tory hands. Mr Miliband said on Sunday: ‘We’re going to put the right values back at the heart of our NHS. ‘The second thing we’re going to do is we’re going to actually do something about GP access. ‘And I’ll tell you why: because a hospital is only as strong as the services in the community, and at the moment those services are creaking. ‘You know one in four people doesn’t get to see their GP for more than a week. We’re going to actually ensure that people can see their GP within 48 hours.’ He added: ‘I am deeply worried about the NHS in the next Parliament... We did promise to protect the NHS and absolutely we want to protect the NHS. ‘We certainly are going to make sure that the NHS doesn’t lose money and we want to do more than that and obviously we’ll be saying more about that between now and the election.’ Shadow health Andy Burnham last night said he would put ‘a new vision for the National Health Service at the heart of the Labour Party manifesto'. He said the NHS was a ‘service on the brink’. Speaking at a fringe event in Manchester, Mr Burnham added: ‘We will work hard to give you peace of mind that your mum, your dad is properly looked after when you’re not there. ‘We should end the scandal of 15 minute visits. We should end the scandal of zero-hours contracts in social care. ‘We are going to build a health service that gives dignity and peace of mind to every older person. ‘We are going to build a health service that lifts social care up off the floor. We’re going to bring social care into the NHS and we’re going to build a 21st century service based on that Labour principle of people before profits.'","Major announcement expected in Labour leader's party conference speech .

"A private firm running a failing NHS clinic will walk off with £53million of taxpayers’ cash thanks to a botched Labour contract. Ministers terminated the contract with Clinicenta to run the treatment centre at Lister Hospital in Stevenage after local GPs stopped referring patients to the unit. They lost confidence in the Lister Surgicentre and the Care Quality Commission watchdog carried out an investigation into the deaths of three people after operations on joints. Ministers terminated the contract with Clinicenta to run the treatment centre at Lister Hospital (pictured) after local GPs stopped referring patients to the unit . The unit, which also carries out eye operations and gynaecological procedures, also lost 8,500 outpatient medical files. According to local doctors, this meant six people suffered irreversible loss of sight because they never received follow-up appointments after eye work. The CQC found the unit was not meeting minimum standards. Yet the terms of the contract signed by Labour mean that the Department of Health must pay £53million to Clinicenta, owned by Carillion, to end the deal. The NHS will resume providing services. Health minister Anna Soubry said Labour 'introduced private NHS provision, and paid over the odds for exorbitant contracts whether or not the work took place or the care was good' Health minister Anna Soubry said: ‘Shadow ministers peddle lies about Coalition privatisation, yet Labour introduced private NHS provision, and paid over the odds for exorbitant contracts whether or not the work took place or the care was good.’ Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be appalled that they have been lumbered with the enormous bill for bringing this contract to an end. ‘It is outrageous that a treatment centre which was failing patients should still have been able to sap up taxpayers’ cash, regardless of its performance. ‘All future deals of this kind must . deliver better taxpayer value for money, with terms that allow for . contracts to be terminated swiftly and easily if the performance of the . service provider is not up to scratch.’ The Surgicentre was run by Clinicenta, which is owned by Carillion, a construction firm.Clinicenta does not run any other NHS treatment centres. Mike Hobbs, the firm’s managing director, said: ‘Our intention is that the services currently provided by Clinicenta at the Lister Surgicentre will transfer by mutual agreement to East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust. ‘The date of transfer is still to be finalised but there will be no break in service provision and the NHS will retain the Lister Surgicentre buildings and equipment for continued use.’ A spokeswoman for East and North Hertfordshire NHS clinical commissioning group said: ‘On termination of the contract, payments totalling approximately £53million will be made to the contractor, Clinicenta. ‘The vast majority of this relates to the value of the building and the equipment which will be retained by the NHS for use in delivering services to patients. We are contractually bound to pay for this even if the contract is not terminated and runs for its full term.’","GPs stopped referring patients to centre run by Clinicenta .

"It had been a humdrum press conference, the like of which are common during pre-season, when suddenly a topic arose to make Brendan Rodgers bristle. ‘How will Liverpool cope without Luis Suarez?’ came the question from the floor. Rodgers, whose side had just beaten Olympiacos 1-0 on Sunday night in Chicago, fixed an icy glare on his inquisitor. Nothing riles him more than the inference Liverpool were a one-man band last season and nothing will give him greater satisfaction than to retain his team’s vibrancy and potency without the forward who has departed for Barcelona.VIDEO Scroll down to see Markovic eyes Premier League trophy . Lightning-quick: Lazar Markovic will be crucial to Liverpool's title chances, according to Brendan Rodgers . In action: The Serbian winger made his first appearance for the club against Olympiacos on Sunday . VIDEO New Liverpool signing eyes Premier League trophy . ‘What do I see when I look at the team?’ said Rodgers (right). ‘I see players who scored 70 goals last season. It’s fairly simple. Luis Suarez is not a Liverpool player any more, so we don’t need to talk about him. When we didn’t have Luis, we scored goals. That won’t be an issue.’ So how will he do it? The first true glimpse of what Liverpool will be like without Suarez arrived in Chicago and will be seen again tomorrow night here in New York, when they lock horns with Manchester City in the Guinness International Champions Cup tournament. Speed is what Rodgers feels Liverpool need; jet-heeled wingers like Lazar Markovic and Raheem Sterling, swapping and interchanging from the flanks, charging at defenders and creating chances for Daniel Sturridge. Rodgers deployed a 4-1-2-3 formation in Chicago, different to last year’s 4-1-3-2 model, with Jordan Henderson and another new boy, Emre Can, positioned just ahead of Steven Gerrard. The aim will be for Liverpool to swarm all over their opponents, blitzing  them with devastating counter-attacks. ‘You look at young Markovic and Raheem, the pace of Daniel,’ Rodgers continued. ‘We have great variety in our attack, full of pace and trickery. ‘We have got people, like Markovic, who can beat defenders. I hope it will be another stand-out season for quality and entertainment.’ Crucial: And the pace of Raheem Sterling will be important . Step up: Daniel Sturridge's form in front of goal will be vital in the efforts to replace the goals of Luis Suarez . Age: 20Born: Cacak, SerbiaPosition: Attacking midfielder .

INTERNATIONAL CAREERSerbia caps 13Goals 2Debut – February 28, 2012: 2-0 v Armenia . Sterling scored the only goal against Olympiacos but Markovic, a £20million signing from Benfica, caught the eye on his debut — one direct surge, memorably, tied two defenders up in knots — and he built on the impression he had made during training at Harvard University in Boston. Already a Serbia international, the 20-year-old is regarded as one of the most promising young players in Europe. Rodgers has been raving about him since he arrived on  Merseyside and with reason: consider these views, for instance, from Rui Costa,  Benfica’s sporting director. ‘Markovic likes to take risks and attack,’ Costa explained. ‘He is very cold blooded when he’s in a one-to-one situation and he’s not afraid of facing the opponents. He’s eager to learn, so I think he will adapt quickly. He is a pure talent.’ If it clicks as Rodgers envisages, the amount of chances Liverpool create will not dwindle. Should that be the case Sturridge, whose role in the team is even more crucial in the post-Suarez era, will be the man to profit. Defiant: Rodgers is certain that his team can challenge again this season . Farewell: But the former Liverpool forward will be missed following his move to Barcelona . ‘The manager has signed young, exciting players, up-and-comers as they call them,’ said Sturridge. ‘We are going to have a winning mentality and the ambition to move forward. We will be an exciting squad that plays attacking football. That’s the Liverpool way. ‘We are a young squad looking to put our stamp down in the Premier League and Europe as well. 'We will try to move  forward as a squad with a great manager behind us who has the exact same mentality. He is hungry for success. We all are.’ If this is a big season for Liverpool, as they strive to show that charge for the title was not a flash in the pan, the same can be said of Sturridge. Can he reproduce the 21 league goals he scored last time? ‘This is a huge club with a lot of players who can step up,’ Sturridge replied. ‘I wouldn’t say it’s by default that I’m the main man. Luis has left and that is football, he’s moved on but he’s doing it for himself and his family. As a team we will move forward, I wouldn’t say I’m the main man. We are going to do our best to move forward.’","Rodgers believes pace will be key to life without Luis Suarez at Liverpool .

"From misspelt quotes to questionable portraits of celebrities, the recent history of tattooing hasn't always been a glorious one. But not every etching is a disaster and some really can be classed as art - in every sense of the word. Now photographs of some of the best, past and present, have been collected in a new book, 1000 Tattoos, and the results are impressive. Would you like tea with that? A full English breakfast reproduced in ink form by American tattooist, Dave Lum . Among the modern inkings included are depictions of full English breakfasts, gallery-worthy portraits of young children and an incredibly detailed version of Leonardo's Last Supper, albeit with monsters in place of the disciples. Vintage examples include the delicate butterflies and insects decorating the skin of Edith Burchett, the wife of George 'The King of Tattoos' Burchett - a Victorian ink specialist who counted George V among his clients. Cindy Ray, real name Bev Robinson, an Australian pin-up girl turned painted lady, also appears as does Ron Ackers, a tattooist born in Portsmouth in 1932 who went on to become one of the greatest skin artists of the age.

"Jamie Carragher has slammed Manchester United for their failure to bring in a top defender to the club during the summer transfer window despite being the top spenders in the Premier League. Sportsmail's Carragher was working as a pundit for Sky Sports on the game between Leicester and Manchester United on Sunday, after the game airing his views on United's defensive frailties - clear for all to see during their 5-3 defeat against the Foxes. Even after landing Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo, the argument from Carragher is that United lack a commanding centre-half, despite spending over £200million on new additions. Jamie Carragher says it was mismanagement by Manchester United not to bring in a top defender . Carragher spoke honestly and passionately as he gave his thoughts on Manchester United's defence . Carragher said: 'Manchester United were the biggest spending team in the Premier League and haven't even bought a proper defender. 'To spend that much money and not bring in a top class defender is mis-management at the end of the day. 'You look at Liverpool last season and the goals they conceded which ultimately cost them the league, United look vulnerable like that at the back this season. 'They look like the United of old in terms of their attacking play and are showing real pace and quality in that department for sure, but defensively you have to question them.' To compound matters for the Red Devils Jonny Evans was taken off injured in the first half, while Tyler Blackett was dismissed in the second half for a professional foul which led to Leicester's fifth and final goal from the penalty spot. Louis van Gaal's disappointment is clear to see on the United bench as they surrendered a two-goal lead .

"A baby who last week became the youngest person to be fitted with an artificial heart has died. Baby Tiarna Middleton passed away at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle just six days after being put on a Berlin heart. It was hoped the 18-day-old baby girl would be kept alive by the artificial heart for long enough to allow her to have a heart transplant. Tiarna Gray, 18 days old, died last night at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital just six days after becoming the youngest person in the UK to be fitted with an artificial heart . Tiarna's parents, Sharney Gray and Gary Middleton, say she died after complications developed . But tragically, she died last night in the hospital’s paediatric intensive care unit with her parents, Sharney Gray and Gary Middleton, at her side. Ms Gray, 22, from Gateshead, said Tiarna had suffered a medical complication in the days following her 10 hour operation and had become extremely ill following a blockage. She said: ‘She passed away last night. They turned the Berlin heart off.’ Tiarna was born on May 22, weighing just 5lb 8oz, and was suffering from a rare condition which meant she was missing vital coronary arteries and the right side of her heart had not grown at all. She was initially put on an ECMO machine - a heart and lung bypass machine - to keep her alive while doctors looked for a donor. However, none were immediately available and medics knew it would be hard to find a heart small enough for her. Tiarna (pictured in hospital last week) was born with severe heart defects and was put on the artificial heart in a bid to keep her alive until a transplant could be carried out . So, she was fitted with the Berlin heart in a bid to keep her alive while medics searched for a donor heart. A Berlin . heart is a device which can be used in people whose hearts are not . strong enough to pump enough blood around their bodies. It is used to allow time for a donor heart to be found. It is an air driven pump which takes over the work of the person's own heart. It can be used to take over the work of one or both sides of the heart. The Berlin heart consists of a plastic chamber which sits outside the body. It . has a blood filled side and an air filled side and the blood filled . side of the pump is connected directly to the child's own heart and main . artery by two tubes. It can be used for as long as several months but a person cannot remain on it indefinitely. Source: Great Ormond Street Hospital .

"Daniel Sturridge is ready to step up and fill the sizeable gap left by Luis Suarez in the Liverpool attack - but says his team-mates need to do likewise as they begin life without the prolific Uruguayan. Suarez finished as Liverpool's leading scorer in each of his three seasons at Anfield, including netting 31 goals in the Barclays Premier League last term as the Reds claimed a top-two spot. However, Brendan Rodgers' men will not be able to rely on Suarez next term after the 27-year-old was sold to Barcelona for a club-record £75million this summer.

The 24-year-old, who was second to Suarez in the Premier League scoring charts last term with 21 goals, said: 'It was a unique partnership, and I wish Luis all the best. We shared some good times together. We created history with our goals and became the most successful Liverpool partnership in one season. 'But in terms of next season for the goals, I'll step up myself and everyone has to.

"Tour operator Thomas Cook has been ordered to pay more than £2,000 to a couple who says their dream getaway was ruined by ‘loutish yobs’ and filthy conditions at their resort. John and Tracey Erskine, who have been married for 20 years, were expecting a relaxing trip on the Mediterranean coast in Turkey when they splurged on the holiday in September 2012. But they say Thomas Cook didn’t deliver on its promise of an ‘outstanding holiday experience’ and their stay turned into a nightmare. Scroll down for video . John and Tracey Erskine took legal action against Thomas Cook after staying at the Voyage Torba in Turkey . Filthy: John and Tracey Erskine complained about dirty conditions, including mouldy walls, at their resort . The Erskines were awarded £2,120 in compensation plus court costs at Warrington County Court after a drawn-out fight with the travel company, but they insist the legal fight was not about the money. The grandparents, who represented themselves during the hearing, complained that they were verbally abused by ‘loutish yobs’ in an apartment just 15ft away and one man from the group performed a sex act on himself on the balcony. They were unhappy with their all-inclusive resort, the Voyage Torba in Turkey, because its toilets were leaking and the walls were mouldy and dirty. They booked the getaway after picking up a copy of the Thomas Cook Style Collection brochure, which claimed to showcase its 'top four-star and above hotels’. Legal fight: The Erskines were awarded £2,120 in compensation plus court costs . It was revealed in court that a Thomas Cook rep arranged for the couple to be moved rooms twice after they complained. But the Erskines felt there was still a ‘lack of care’ by the travel company and not enough was done to protect them from the ‘vile’ group of men. When they returned to their home near Winwick, Warrington, Cheshire, they wrote to Thomas Cook but their complaints were ignored. They started legal proceedings for £3,278 to cover the cost of the holiday and compensation. Rude: The couple says they were verbally abused by ‘loutish yobs’ in an apartment just 15ft away . Thomas Cook denied that it could be held accountable and said its rep had done ‘all she reasonably could' At the end of the drawn-out ordeal, Mrs . Erskine, a former member of Merseyside police, said: ‘I feel relieved . more than happy that it is finally over. ‘I am disappointed that we had to go to such great lengths for them to acknowledge what happened to us. It was never about the money - it was the principle of the matter.’ The Erskines booked the holiday as a belated 50th birthday present for John, now aged 53, following a traumatic year. Mrs Erskine, 51, said: ‘We were looking for a relaxing break where we could some spend time together. ‘We wanted peace and serenity and that's what we thought we were going to get.’ Obscene: John and Tracey Erskine say a neighbour performed a sex act on himself on the balcony . 'Lack of care': The Erskines felt Thomas Cook did not do enough to protect them from the ‘vile’ group of men . Josephine Scally, who represented Thomas Cook in court, admitted that it was a ‘horrendous’ experience but denied that the company could be held accountable for the problems and said the rep had done ‘all she reasonably could’. She said: ‘The fault lies with the management and the representative of the clearly unpleasant young men.’ A Thomas Cook spokesman said the company is ‘disappointed by the outcome’ but accepts the judge’s decision. He said: ‘This incident was very much an isolated occurrence and we are confident that those due to stay at the property will enjoy the quality holiday experience they would come to expect from Thomas Cook.’","John and Tracey Erskine were expecting a relaxing getaway in Turkey .

"An Ebola survivor has donated blood to a fellow American aid worker infected with the disease, and doctors treating him at a Nebraska hospital say he has responded well to aggressive treatment in the past week. Dr. Rick Sacra received blood transfusions from Dr. Kent Brantly shortly after arriving at the Nebraska Medical Center last Friday, Dr. Phil Smith said Thursday. Sacra, 51, also has been given an experimental drug and other treatments. Sacra is close friends with Brantly, 33, one of the first two Americans treated for Ebola in Atlanta last month, from their missionary work. Scroll down for video . Transfusion: Dr Rick Sacra is receiving blood transfusions from Dr Kent Brantly, who recently recovered from Ebola . In treatment: Debbie Sacra reads Bible verses to her husband Dr. Richard Sacra via a video link in Omaha, Nebraska as he is treated for Ebola at the biocontainment unit at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha . 'It really meant a lot to us that he was willing to give that donation so quickly after his own recovery,' Sacra's wife, Debbie, said. The transfusions are believed to help a patient fight off the Ebola virus because the survivor's blood carries antibodies for the disease. More than 2,200 people have died in West Africa during the current Ebola outbreak, although Ebola hasn't been confirmed as the cause of all those deaths. Debbie Sacra said she hopes her husband's illness and the experience of other aid workers can lead to new treatments for Ebola in West Africa before the outbreak spreads. Recovery: Dr. Kent Brantly (right), stands with his wife, Amber Brantly, during a press conference announcing his release from Emory Hospital on August 21, 2014 in Atlanta, Georgia after his successful treatment for Ebola . Hopeful: Debbie Sacra laughs as she answers a question at a news conference held at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Neb., Thursday, September 11, 2014 . Medical missionary: In this undated photo released by the Nebraska Medical Center, Dr. Richard Sacra examines a foot of a child in west Africa . Rick Sacra, who had been working at a hospital in Liberia with the North Carolina-based charity SIM, also received an experimental drug that doctors refuse to identify. And he has received supportive care including IV fluids. Smith said doctors wanted to treat Sacra aggressively to give him the best chance of recovering. But he said that makes it hard to determine what is helping him improve. 'We administered everything we had access to,' Smith said. The doctors treating Sacra are talking with doctors at Emory University Hospital who have treated two previous Ebola patients and are currently treating another Ebola patient. They hope to develop new treatment plans based on their experiences. Longtime service: This 2007 photo released by the Nebraska Medical Center shows Dr. Richard Sacra working in west Africa . Officials announced Thursday that Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen's foundation is donating $9 million to help the U.S. government fight the disease in West Africa. The grant to the CDC Foundation will help establish emergency operations centers to better track and respond to Ebola. Sacra was the third American aid worker with the Ebola virus to be flown to the U.S. for treatment. A fourth worker, whose identity has not yet been revealed, arrived Tuesday morning at Emory in Atlanta. Few details have been released about the fourth American Ebola patient. But the World Health Organization said a doctor who had been working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone tested positive for the disease and was to be evacuated Monday in stable condition. Debbie Sacra said she knows her husband will be eager to return to West Africa once he recovers. 'I'm sure when he gets his strength back, he'll be ready to go back to Liberia,' she said.","Dr Rick Sacra is responding to 'aggressive treatment' for Ebola virus at a Nebraska hospital .

"One of the first schools to be given academy status during Michael Gove's tenure as Education Secretary has been conned out of more than £1million in a simple email fraud. Staff at St Aldhelm's Academy, which posted England's worst GCSE results in 2012, received an email from fraudsters posing as bank workers. The out-of-the-blue message asked for the sort code of the school's bank account, which finance staff, falling for the con, passed on. Staff from the school's finance department fell for the scam and handed over the academy's bank details . The criminals then withdrew £1.1million from the school's account. The money is thought to have been a Government loan for a £9.8million rebuilding programme at the academy in Poole, Dorset. It is understood that the money came from the Department for Education's Education Funding Agency and Whitehall are demanding it back at the rate of around £75,000 a month. A source close to the school branded the fraud 'a disaster'. The police were called in once staff realised they had lost the money. The scam is believed to have been part of wider organised crime activity, linked to Eastern Europe, that has targeted other institutions in the UK. Officers from Dorset have joined up with the National Crime Agency and other forces, including the Metropolitan Police, as part of a wider inquiry. In a statement, headteacher Cheryl Heron said: 'St Aldhelm's was subject to an external fraud in July last year. A stock image. The school posted the country's worst GCSE results in 2012 and is trying to improve . 'The academy acted swiftly, referred the matter immediately to the police and the case is still being investigated. 'The fraud has not impacted on the day-to-day running of the academy or our recent building work, which was completed on schedule. 'It would be inappropriate to comment further while police investigations are ongoing.' Conor Burns, the Bournemouth West MP, who has worked closely with the school, said: 'This appalling fraud is a very sad and serious event for the school. 'I have been aware of it for some time and working with ministers to try to support the school as much as possible. 'The key priority for me and them is to ensure that as the school seeks to recover from this blow and that the focus remains firmly on giving the young people who learn there the best possible start in life. 'Having worked very closely with the school and knowing how involved ministers and senior officials are, I am confident that we will soon have positive developments for St Aldhelm's.' A Department for Education spokesman said: 'St Aldhelm's has been the victim of a sophisticated serious fraud by a third party. 'The matter was immediately referred to the police and Action Fraud by the academy trust and to the EFA. The matter continues to be investigated by the police.' The school used to be known as Rossmore Community College and relaunched as Poole's first academy in 2010. It has 504 students aged 11-19. Local taxpayers have reacted with shock at the crime. One wrote on an internet message board: 'If the teaching staff are as thick as school finance chiefs it's no wonder they posted the worst GCSE results in the country in 2012.' Another posted: 'I am absolutely speechless. These scams are well known and have been pretty much since the internet was invented. How could the staff have been caught by it?'","Finance staff at St Aldhelm's Academy, Poole, fell for an email scam .

"Don’t worry, Manchester City fans. There could be a saviour on the way. After watching their side lose to Stoke for the first time in the Premier League, the City faithful will have been feeling a bit down. Now, they could see one of the world’s best strikers in their line-up when they take on Arsenal after the international break. The Premier League champions have a long-standing interest in Falcao, whose move is more likely with Alvaro Negredo keen to sign for Valencia on loan. Transfer: Radamel Falcao could be on his way to the Premier League with Manchester City . Falcao normally carries a £50million price tag but he is also available on loan for the season at a cost of £12m. City’s director of football Txiki Begiristain is understood to have held talks with Monaco officials at last Thursday’s Champions League draw in the principality. Real Madrid were favourites to sign Falcao, 28, who appeared to confirm his move to the Bernabeu in a message posted on his official Twitter account that was hastily deleted on Saturday. However, Madrid instead opted for Javier Hernandez from Manchester United. Falcao’s agent Jorge Mendes is believed to have spent last week pushing Falcao towards the Etihad in the hope of executing both deals. The situation has been further complicated by the fact that Negredo is sidelined with a broken foot. The Spaniard has had a protective boot removed and no longer requires crutches, but he was seen limping after Saturday’s home defeat by Stoke and is out of action for at least another month. Available: Monaco have offered the Colombian forward on a permanent or loan deal . Monaco: Falacao has endured a difficult time at Monaco since joining from Atletico Madrid . City would have had to sell Negredo and possibly two more if they wanted to sign Falcao on a permanent deal and still meet the £49m net spend limit set by UEFA’s financial fair play rules but the loan agreement wouldn’t be a problem. The City boss said: ‘We will see what happens. We have a restriction about the amount of money we can spend and the number of players we can use, so it’s not easy.’ Pellegrini was speaking after seeing City fail to score at home in the league for only the second time in 71 games. With Sergio Aguero making his first start of the season and Edin Dzeko, Stevan Jovetic, David Silva and Samir Nasri at Pellegrini’s disposal, City looked flat following last week’s win over Liverpool. World Cup: Falcao missed out on playing at the World Cup after suffering a serious knee einjury . The defeat by Stoke could not have come at a worse time for Pellegrini as he prepares to lose his players to international duty once again before a week of critical fixtures. City face title rivals Arsenal and Chelsea on consecutive weekends either side of a visit to Bayern Munich in their opening Champions League tie. City were undone by a wonderful solo goal from Mame Biram Diouf. The former Manchester United striker raced 70 yards after Stoke cleared a City corner in the 58th minute and scored through the legs of England goalkeeper Joe Hart. ‘It was a goal we cannot concede,’ added Pellegrini. ‘It came from our corner.’ City may also sell players today with Matija Nastasic, Micah Richards, Scott Sinclair and John Guidetti available. SUPER STAT: Stoke ended a run of 12 Premier League defeats in Manchester, having lost away to City and United on every occasion since winning promotion in 2008. MANCHESTER CITY (4-2-3-1): Hart 5.5; Sagna 6.5, Kompany 6, Demichelis 5.5, Kolarov 5; Fernando 6 (Fernandinho 38, 5), Toure 6.5; Nasri 6 (Navas 63, 6), Silva 6.5, Jovetic 5 (Dzeko 63, 5.5); Aguero 6.

"England finished bottom of Group D in their worst World Cup performance for two generations. After being beaten by Italy and Uruguay and stumbling to a 0-0 draw with Costa Rica, JAMIE REDKNAPP and MARTIN KEOWN examine what the future holds for Roy Hodgson and his team. Did you see any hope in the game against Costa Rica? MARTIN KEOWN: Daniel Sturridge did well with balls over the top but he needs to put more chances away. Ross Barkley and Jack Wilshere looked OK in the middle and it was good to give Luke Shaw World Cup experience. Ben Foster made some good saves and could put Joe Hart under some much-needed pressure. JAMIE REDKNAPP: It’s difficult to judge against a team that’s already qualified and I didn’t learn much from the game. But with Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard coming to the end with England, Jack Wilshere has an open goal to become our midfield general. He needs to do more, though. Plus point: Daniel Sturridge was lively against Costa Rica, but he needs to put more chances away . What’s your main memory of England’s World Cup? REDKNAPP: Frustration, more so than at any other tournament. We have good players but why can’t we motivate them? This was not a group of death. There were some bang average teams in there but we finished bottom of the lot. With the players we have, that is an absolute failure. KEOWN: It’s been tough to be an Englishman abroad. In Brazil the deflation of the fans has been obvious. The locals find it funny how badly England did and for the media it’s been just as bad. England failed to make a mark and left themselves open to ridicule. Tough times: It has not been easy being an Englishman in Brazil after the nation's failure . What one thing would you do to improve the team? KEOWN: We need a better understanding of systems so we can change tactics and not just personnel to have an impact on games. Other teams, such as Holland and Chile, have done that in Brazil, but are we brave enough? REDKNAPP: We have to decide how we want to play. Roy Hodgson is a natural 4-4-2 coach but the current system looks uncomfortable. We need to stop being so easy to beat and learn to see out games. I’d also like us to build a team around Ross Barkley for Euro 2016. Central figure: Ross Barkley is the key to England's future . Who do you want to win the World Cup now? JAMIE REDKNAPP: I never expected England to win it but to go out now is a low for English football, no matter how you look at it. I don’t mind who wins, it’s just good to see teams having a real go. MARTIN KEOWN: I picked Neymar to be top scorer and Brazil to win it, so I’m sticking with them. When the home nation does well, the tournament ignites. It looks like the lights at the party are flickering into life. Yellow peril: Neymar heads the scoring charts as Brazil gear up for a round of 16 encounter with Chile .","Ross Barkley and Jack Wilshere looked OK in the middle and it was good to give Luke Shaw World Cup experience .

"The difference 12 months makes. When Jose Mourinho last visited Goodison Park, his post-match debrief revolved around his frustrations that Chelsea lacked a top-class striker. He spoke about his side’s evolving ‘profile’, lamented the chances they had squandered in a 1-0 defeat and explained why it was the one area that was likely to hinder Chelsea’s pursuit of honours. Fast forward to the present and a £32million investment has transformed Mourinho’s squad. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho explain how happy he is with Diego Costa . Elation: Diego Costa runs off in celebration after scoring Chelsea's sixth and final goal at Goodison Park . Looking up: Costa has now scored four goals in just three Premier League appearances so far this season . With four goals in three games, Diego Costa has made a better start to his Chelsea career than some of the Premier League’s most successful recent imports. Goals after three games: . 4 - D Costa (Chelsea) 3 - S Aguero (Man City) 2 - R van Nistelrooy (Man United) 1 - D Drogba (Chelsea) 1 - L Suarez (Liverpool) 1 - F Torres (Liverpool) PS - Robin van Persie did score four in his first three games for Manchester United, but he had already been in the Premier League for eight years. In Diego Costa, Mourinho has found the missing link. If Costa arrived from Atletico Madrid with some questions hanging over him, having seriously underwhelmed during Spain’s wretched World Cup campaign, he is swiftly providing emphatic answers that he is the real deal. His performance in a helter-skelter collision with Everton, one which finished with a score — 3-6 — more befitting a game of tennis, was everything you could ask for from a high-end forward: slick, strong, aggressive and clinical. ‘It’s been nice to score goals but the most important thing is I help the team to win,’ said Costa. ‘Hopefully that continues all season. We have had a great start but there is a long way to go.’ Costa tormented Everton’s defence, driving them to distraction. There were some unedifying moments — his squabbles with Seamus Coleman and Tim Howard, for instance — but there was also undisputed class, like when he sidestepped his pursuers to finish the scoring late on. Mourinho, understandably, was keen to champion Costa’s dazzling impact — to think selling Romelu Lukaku for £28million almost recouped the fee he spent on the 25-year-old — but, inevitably, there was something else he wanted to say and his message was clear: Costa needs protection. ‘Diego is a mature guy,’ Mourinho said. ‘He has played in some very big matches and comes from a situation where this is no pressure for him. Roar: Costa tormented Everton’s defence, driving them to distraction, and had spats with Seamus Coleman . Caught: Costa created arguments with Coleman and goalkeeper Tim Howard but showed class at times . Grab: Mourinho, understandably, was keen to highlight champion Costa’s dazzling impact on Chelsea . Words: Everton goalkeeper Howard grabs Costa by the scruff of the neck after the controversial celebration . ‘He comes to play football and to give a spectacle but people have been chasing cards for him like they did in this match and, in fact, the referees are moving in this direction, too, because he has had two yellow cards in three matches, which is hard to understand. ‘Imagine the millions watching around the world and, because Everton players are chasing him to get cards, I take him off? I don’t think that is fair. ‘I don’t think this is what the people want. I don’t think this is what the Premier League wants. So when people chase him for cards, give cards to these players. Chased, chased! He has two yellow cards. He’s scored four goals. He is one of, if not the best, player in the Premier League in these three games. Normally he has to get Player of the Month. Normally. But he has two yellow cards.’ Sympathy for Costa was in short supply. He is not a shrinking violet and, when Everton pressed his buttons, he gave as good as he got, never shying away from the confrontation. Costa is a street-fighter and Mourinho may have to accept he will court trouble. ‘I’ve been in the British game for almost 20 seasons and I know the football culture. With Spain and South America, I know the players take time to adapt,’ said Everton manager Roberto Martinez. Exchange: Costa and Sylvain Distin get involved in a heated debate during the controversial Chelsea win . Opener: Costa scored Chelsea's first goal after just 34 seconds at Goodison Park on Saturday evening . ‘But he needs to understand we are quite unique in our league: we are very honest and respectful. You don’t see that sort of behaviour in our league (Costa celebrated in front of Coleman after the Everton defender’s own goal). ‘That’s not a reflection of the class that he has. He’s a top player and has had to fight for what he’s got. It’s a real shame when you’ve got a childish reaction like that.’ After conceding 10 goals in the first three games, Martinez has other things to worry about than Costa’s behaviour but will take some solace that Everton won’t face a side of Chelsea’s quality every week. ‘It was difficult for us to score away from home last season,’ said Mourinho. ‘But, in this game, we were brilliant in that aspect but were very bad defensively. We conceded too much and must be more solid from a defensive point of view, so we are far from perfect. 'We have given people some nice feelings in these three matches. The Chelsea Blues have a feeling this team will be good in this competition all this season. But that is just feelings. We have a lot of work to do. We’ve nine points from three games but so too do Swansea.’ Save: Everton goalkeeper Howard sticks out his right leg to deny Costa yet another goal on Saturday evening .

It's not too late to play MailOnline's Fantasy Football - there's still 36 weeks of £1,000 prizes to be won. CLICK HERE to play NOW! The second MailOnline Fantasy Football Grand Master of the season can be revealed - Mrs Radostina Staneva, who lives in east London. The manager of Tina (yes, that's really her team name) scoops the second £1,000 weekly prize after a weekend performance inspired by Tottenham and Man City players which saw her earn a whopping 283 Fantasy Football points. Like Kevin Brown, the winner on Week One, Mrs Staneva will now have to wait until the January transfer window before she can replenish her side after using all 16 transfers last weekend to secure the prize. Team Tina featured three different goalkeepers - Thibault Courtois, Hugo Lloris and Joe Hart - over the weekend. And selecting City frontmen Stevan Jovetic and Edin Dzeko up front on Monday proved decisive. Here, Mrs Staneva, who is 52 and supports Arsenal, explains her strategy: 'Before I started playing towards the second week competition I looked at the entire round of fixtures. I made a prediction of all 10 games. Prize pair: Stevan Jovetic (left) and Edin Dzeko (right) starred for Man City in their 3-1 win over Liverpool . 'I wanted to make sure I get at least 30 points from Saturday excluding other bonuses (such as goals, assists etc). 'I constructed a bench consisting of cheap players playing on Sunday. I picked a Tottenham bench featuring Harry Kane (£5.5m) as I knew that he will come as a sub and bring bonus points for a win. I had Darren Fletcher as he was very cheap and also playing on Sunday. 'I played cheap bench so that I can accommodate players from Man City (who are the most expensive in the game). In other words, I was thinking about the final game on Monday when I started building my team. 'I predicted a comfortable win for Chelsea so I started with Chelsea's almost entire team and some other cheap players, such as Neil Taylor (I expected Swansea to win), Scott Arfield is in starting the XI and Marouane Chamakh (who paid off for his price with a goal), around them. 'On Sunday I focused onTottenham as QPR's record at White Hart Lane is poor and they have just recruited new defenders who need time to gel together. Man Utd have new coach while Hull-Stoke was unpredictable and that is why I ignored these two fixtures. The winning formula: Mrs Staneva's winning side on Monday after using all her 16 transfers . 'As for Monday, Liverpool did not play well in the game last week against Southampton so I predicted Man City's win. Having said that I accommodated nine Man City players in order to collect around 27 points only for a win.' Check out Mrs Staneva's winning team (above) and remember, it's not too late for you to enter a team and go for the £1,000 weekly prize - you have 36 more week's to claim a prize! All you have to do is be the top manager on one of the 38 Premier League game weeks to be crowned a Grand Master. Cumulative points over the season do not count towards the weekly prize.

"Holidaymakers on a budget certainly won't be kicking up a stink about this hotel. A unique concept is offering travellers to Germany and Austria accommodation in refurbished sewer pipes. The Das Park hotel has converted the 6ft-tall, 9.5tonne concrete structures into cosy rooms that include double beds, luggage space and even power points to charge mobile phones and digital cameras. The Das Park hotels in Germany and Austria have converted the concrete barrels into cosy rooms . They even feature wall paintings which have been created by Austrian artist Thomas Latzel Ochoa. However, there are no windows - apart from a small circular airhole near to the top of the pipes - and guests must use toilets and showers in local public buildings. Tourists can book the hotel rooms for up to three nights free of charge, or they can offer to pay 'whatever they can afford' to support the project. The hotel is currently only open from May to October. A spokesman for Das Park said: 'The pipe's stark and minimalist exterior contrasts with the high levels of comfort in the interior. 'It's a hotel room that's as simple as a locker. Thanks to its minimalist design, Das Park Hotel is particularly simple to maintain and operate. Tourists can book the hotel for up to three nights free of charge, or  pay 'whatever they can afford' The Das Park hotel rooms even feature wall paintings by Austrian artist Thomas Latzel Ochoa . There are three 'suites' located in a public park in the Austrian city of Ottensheim, while there are five suites located in Bernepark, Germany (pictured) 'The surrounding area is incorporated into the overall concept through the use of local infrastructure and through co-operation with local businesses. 'For operators, Das Park Hotel is a low cost and unique type of accommodation that is consciously integrated into its local economic environment, creating a very special kind of travel destination. 'Hotel guests enjoy a hip and unconventional overnight stay in exciting designer surroundings, and an entirely different kind of hotel experience. 'Novel, minimalist accommodation concepts are becoming more and more sought-after; one of the reasons why Das Park Hotel is so popular with its guests.' There are three 'suites' located in a public park in the Austrian city of Ottensheim, while there are five suites located in Bernepark, near Essen in Germany. Guests are required to book their rooms at the hotel's website. Upon acceptance of the booking, guests receive a code to unlock the door to their pipe. The thick cement keeps the interior comfortable and eliminates noise from outside while the concrete walls are cool on hot days and comfortably warn in winter.","The Das Park hotel has converted 6ft-tall concrete structures into rooms .

"Ryanair's image overhaul will extend to a redesign of their aircraft's interiors that removes 'in your face' yellow and blue colours in favour of something more subtle, the budget carrier's chief executive Michael O'Leary says. Images of 'happy, smiley people' could also go in place of the Ryanair logos on the walls of their planes as the airline continues an attempt to improve its no frills image, moves for which have already included the reduction in some charges and family incentives. 'If we're going to focus more and more, as we are, on the customer experience, maybe a little less in your face and the use of more subtle colours and better imaging,' said O'Leary in a press conference, admitting he gave the green light to the in-cabin yellow a decade ago. Garish: Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary says the airline could resign plane interiors to be less 'in your face' Image makeover: Ryanair is in the midst of a push to focus more on the 'customer experience' 'I think on the bulkheads we're looking at something a bit more lively than just the yellow with the blue Ryanair logo. 'We're looking at different alternatives such as photos of happy, smiley people, destinations – something a bit more visually interesting than just the traditional old logo.' There could be a wait however for any such changes, with O'Leary's publicly announced plans not always coming to fruition - in the past the CEO has mused about standing-room only cabins, coin-operated toilets ('spend a pound to spend a penny') and a 'fat tax' for larger passengers. Grain of salt: Not all of the plans O'Leary has spoken of have come to fruition . The earliest travellers are likely to any any widespread change to the Ryanair plane designs would be in 2019 when the airline rolls out a new fleet of Boeing 737 MAX 200s. O'Leary made his comments while announcing almost 200 of the planes would be delivered as part of a £13.6bn deal with Boeing.","Michael O'Leary was behind 'bright' design of Ryanair's interiors .

"British mountaineer Kenton Cool has defended his decision to take Sir Richard Branson’s son Sam to the summit of the Matterhorn, despite the 29-year-old old falling ill with severe altitude sickness. The 40-year-old managed to guide Sam to the top of the mountain during a recent charity climb, even though Branson began struggling to walk and had difficulties breathing as they closed in on the peak. The pair battled on before Cool finally called for a helicopter to airlift Sam off the mountain after they had both reached the top. Scroll down for for video . Sir Richard Branson's son Sam was taken seriously ill with extreme altitude sickness as he neared the summit of the Matterhorn in Switzerland during a recent charity climb . British mountaineer Kenton Cool radioed for a helicopter to take Sam Branson back down the mountain . Cool, who has reached the summit of Mount Everest 11 times during his illustrious climbing career, said he expects criticism for his decision not to send Sam back down the mountain when the effects of the altitude first began to show. ‘I have no doubt that people will say it was a poor mountaineering decision to take Sam to the top,’ said Cool. ‘But honestly, the effects of the altitude took hold really quickly – only half an hour or 40 minutes at most. ‘When we got around 200 meters from the top, Sam started to slow up. I started to notice this as we approached the shoulder of the mountain. Sam Branson was struggling to walk and breathe as the group closed in on the peak of the 4,478m peak . The group managed to help Sam (yellow jacket, middle) conquer the final 200m before he was airlifted down the mountain . ‘Sam said to me “I don’t feel good, I feel nauseous”. As soon as someone says “nauseous” at high altitude you start thinking “this could be altitude”. 'It was a pretty rapid deterioration after that. He started to dry heave, the colour began to drain from his face and he slowed right down. ‘Sam is a very emotional young man and the emotion may have been a little overwhelming for him. He was in tears, he thought the opportunity to summit was evaporating before his eyes. ‘We gave him a pep talk and perhaps told him that he had an obligation to those around him! ‘But I knew by this time that to get Sam down safely was going to be a mammoth task, bordering on the impossible. I was already thinking that we would have to call a rescue in. There was no way we were getting the boy down.’ At this stage Branson was struggling to breathe properly and on the verge of losing consciousness. ‘But we were so close by this stage, and by the time he got to the top he just collapsed and was heaving his guts up,’ said Cool. ‘Emotionally he crumbled at this point. 'It was the fulfilment of a dream, a challenge. It was a remarkable day, a triumph on every level.’ Remarkably, mountaineer Kenton Cool managed to help Sam reach the summit before radioing for a helicopter . Mr Cool, who is the founder of mountain and ski guide company Dream Guides, was recruited by Sam Branson to join the Virgin STRIVE challenge which has been raising money Big Change, a charity founded by six friends including Sam Branson, Holly Branson, and Princess Beatrice. The charity raises funds to help young people develop life skills. The event involved travelling from London’s O2 to the top of the Matterhorn in Switzerland. The different legs of the journey saw the group complete three marathons from London to Dover, rowing the English Channel, cycling 900km to Verbier before finally hiking seven days across the Alps in a bid to reach the top of the 4,478m peak. Sam Branson (centre ) with Noah Devereux (left) and Stephan Shanly (right) at Summit . Mr Cool said that the ascent of the Matterhorn had been hit by adverse weather conditions meaning the group almost didn’t attempt the ascent at all. He said: ‘Nobody had been summiting and the local guides weren’t even entertaining an attempt on the mountain. But it is hard to put into words just how much energy and team spirit there was. I’ve got a reputation, along with the other guides working with me, for pulling off the impossible. ‘We waited several days for the conditions to improve before leaving camp at 3am. Things were against us all the way up. The Hornli hunt near the base of the mountain was shut so we had to start our ascent 600m lower down the mountain. ‘We still thought that if we got to the Solvay hut about half way up that would be a good result. The group's ascent to the summit of the Matterhorn was undertaken as part of the Virgin Strive Challenge . ‘But people were moving fast and efficiently and we started making progress upwards. When we got half way up confidence just started to grow and we felt we were going to summit.’ Gloucestershire-based Mr Cool currently holds the record for the most amount of Everest summits by a European climber, having reached the peak 11 times. In 2012 he took one of the 1924 Olympic Gold Medals awarded to the 1922 British Everest Expedition to the summit of the 8,848m Himalayan peak, resulting in Lord Coe personally thanking Cool and his team for ‘kick starting the 2012 Olympic Games’. In 2009 he successfully led explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes to the top of the mountain while in 2013 he and his climbing partner Dorje Gylgen became the first people to attain the Everest Triple Crown; summiting Everest, Nuptse and Lhotse in the space of just seven days, a feat previously thought impossible. Dream Guides founder Mr Cool currently holds the record for the most amount of Everest summits by a European climber, having reached the peak 11 times . He now says he hopes to mount another record-breaking expedition next year by summiting the world’s three highest mountains - Everest, K2 and Kangchenjunga - within three months. It means he will have climbed a total of almost 60,000ft in 12 weeks if he is successful. The only people to have summited all three mountains have previously taken five years to complete the challenge. He added: ‘We are calling it the “Himalayan Trilogy”. It will be a real test of human endurance and a huge mental challenge. I think it will take me to some pretty dark places while I’m on the mountain. And such a huge amount of time away from home where I have a young family, that is going to be really testing.’ Mr Cool has also revealed that a wealthy client once offered him a six-figure sum to take them to the summit of Everest, although he declined the offer after fearing that the individual would not make it to the top. He said: ‘My hit rate on Everest is way up there. The average success rate for most people going up there is around 50 per cent. My success rate is about 82 per cent. I don’t want to jeopardise that by taking someone up there with an open cheque book and no climbing experience. I’m not interested in that. ‘The buzz words at the moment are “adventure tourism”. Some people are guilty of promoting Everest as the ultimate adventure tourist spot. I tried to promote Everest as the ultimate adventure. ‘It has nothing to do with tourism. I want people to go to the mountain and look at it with the same eyes that I look at it with. I want them to fall in love with it like I have. ‘Of course I have been approached by wealthy people. There is one person who does spring to mind. 'He was very keen to climb Everest. It would have been expensive, put it that way, because I work one-on-one. I was once misquoted as saying ""if you want to climb Everest with me, it’s £500,000"". 'That was a bit over the top. But I suppose it depends on how much you are willing to put on fulfilling your dream, and some people have more financial clout than others.’ Kenton Cool works for Dream-Guides.com .","Mountain guide Kenton Cool helped Sam reach the top of the 4,478m peak .

"I've being saying it for months that Robin van Persie needs to be shown the exit door at Manchester United. He was woeful against Liverpool. As soon as a player starts to kick up it spreads through the dressing room and sours the squad. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reaction from David Moyes and Brendan Rodgers . Exit: Stuttering striker Robin van Persie needs to be shown the door at Manchester United . Sour: His woeful performances are affecting the rest of the squad . Ineffective: Van Persie's heat map shows how little he was involved in the game . Van Persie is not pulling his weight and his comment last week that he wanted to end his career at Manchester United was a smoke screen. He clearly wants out. David Moyes has a lot to sort out. Juan Mata is not a wide player, he does not have the pace and athleticism to play on the left or right wing for United. Jose Mourinho bombed him out of Chelsea because he can't run box-to-box. He needs to be playing in the middle of the pitch, in the same position as Wayne Rooney, to be effective. The balance is not right and the chemistry is simply not there. They lack pace, they lack unity and they lack team spirit. Moyes needs a top draw holding central midfield player and two new young, mobile centre backs. But first and foremost, top of his priorities, should be getting rid of RVP. No wide boy: Juan Mata does not have the pace or athleticism to play on the wing . Thrashed: Liverpool were dominant at Old Trafford as United floundered at home again . Changes: David Moyes' squad overhaul should start with getting rid of Van Persie . Thirteen years ago I was watching a game between Stevenage reserves and Ford United reserves on a cold Tuesday night. I spotted this skinny young boy, who looked like he was suffering from malnutrition, playing against some of Ford’s tough, big men from Essex. The boy had a great left foot and was striding up and down the wing with confidence. Going down: George Boyd dived trying to win a penalty for Hull against Manchester City on Saturday . It was clear that night that the kid was one to watch. His name was George Boyd. I . do not know him personally, but I admire all players who have come into . football fighting their way through the lower tiers to get to the top. George . has gone through clubs at the Conference, League Two, League One and . the Championship to get where he is now. Demonstrating . that you can make the big steps up with hard work and dedication should . make him a role model to all young players It can take you an awful . long time. Not that type of player: Boyd would not have deliberately spat at Joe Hart . Now 28 years old, he's been rejected, knocked back and kept going. He once had a medical at Nottingham Forest and was told he had a dodgy eye. I don't believe for one moment a player with his personalty and characteristics would deliberately spit at Joe Hart. He is a good Boyd. What a pleasure it was to be a guest of talkSPORT radio at the Cheltenham Festival on Gold Cup day. I was well looked after by Paddy Power - believe it or not there is actually a bloke called Paddy Power who owns the betting firm. When I met the producer Mike outside with my ticket, I thought he was having a laugh as we made our way through the crowds to the corporate boxes down near the finishing line. Well looked after: Mad Dog was at the Cheltenham Festival last week . When we made our way up the steps to our box I noticed just to the right was the Royal Box and inside I could see Princess Anne and Zara Phillips. That's the closest I've come to the Royal family since one of them shook my hand on the pitch at Wembley before the game against Oxford in the 1986 Milk Cup final. You should've seen the shocked look on my face. I was mixing with the top punters who were whispering into their mobile phones to get their bets on. Royalty: Zara Phillips (second left) was also at the Cheltenham Festival . I must say, I kept my betting slip secretly under wraps as my five pound win slips would've probably been quite embarrassing to the big-hitting professionals there that day. I was getting tips left right and centre and, as always, every single one of them was straight from the horse's mouth. My tip that afternoon on the Hawksbee and Jacobs show was for an Aston Villa victory against Chelsea. When I said that Andy Jacobs, a Chelsea season ticket holder wearing his wonderful tweed Cheltenham suit, looked at me like I was mad. Top tip: My tip for the Cheltenham festival... was for Aston Villa to beat Chelsea . But I knew there was a chance of a slip up, with the energy and athleticism of Paul Lambert's young team and the outstanding quality of Christian Benteke, coupled with a Champions League game just a few days away for Chelsea. Lambert has never once criticised his players through some testing times this season and, mark my words, the players at Villa will be challenging next year towards the top end of the league, rather than worrying about the bottom. Dejan Lovren has shown this season in the centre of Southampton's defence that he has got b***s. Well, after the weekend, he is certainly nursing them after a Norwich player accidentally stepped on one of his testicles. It made me wince when I heard that it had swelled up. Painful: Dejan Lovren suffered a nasty injury in the win against Norwich... It reminds me of the second-most watched video clip in the Allen household - the one of Phil Babb trying to clear the ball off the line against Chelsea with an amazing sliding clearance, only to miss the ball and be skewered by the post between his legs. It was in front of the live TV cameras and an Anfield stadium packed to the rafters. It never fails to bring a tear to the eye. Oh by the way, the most-watched video clip and voted unanimously as number one at my home was of the Luton Town supporters on YouTube chanting 'Martin Allen is a...' repeatedly at me for 10 minutes. I can't possibly repeat what they said in this column. I was manager at Brentford at the time. My sons thought it was amusing. Quite often if I said they couldn't go out, or that it was time for their bed or that they had to do their homework, they would put the YouTube clip on inside the house at full volume!","Robin van Persie should leave Manchester United .

"Boris Johnson was branded a liar yesterday in the growing row over his £100billion plan for an airport in the Thames estuary. Sir Howard Davies, head of the independent Airports Commission, reacted angrily after Mr Johnson criticised his decision to reject plans for a so-called ‘Boris Island’ airport. The London Mayor claimed on Tuesday that Sir Howard had told him privately that London would need a new airport by 2020 even if Heathrow was expanded. Sir Howard Davies, head of the independent Airports Commission, (pictured) reacted angrily after Mr Johnson criticised his decision to reject plans for a so-called ‘Boris Island’ airport and says his claims are 'untrue' He criticised the ‘myopic’ decision to reject his plan, and suggested the Commission had been leant on by risk-averse Whitehall pen-pushers. In a frank response yesterday, Sir Howard said most of Mr Johnson’s assertions ‘are actually untrue’. He told The Times that the suggestion he was doing Whitehall’s bidding by rejecting ‘Boris Island’ was ‘a complete lie’. ‘I think he is not looking carefully at the analysis and I think that’s what he’d be better advised to do rather than produce conspiracy theories’. The Mayor’s office declined to comment on Mr Davies’s intervention. Mayor of London Boris Johnson was branded a liar  in the growing row over his plan for a new airport . Mr Johnson was also under pressure on a separate front last night after two Tory MPs urged him to show some ‘political courage’ by standing against Ukip in next month’s Clacton by-election. Hendon MP Matthew Offord and Carlisle MP John Stevenson said Mr Johnson should demonstrate his ‘willingness to play for the team’ by taking on defector Douglas Carswell in his Essex homeland. Opinion polls suggest Mr Carswell, who stunned Westminster by defecting to Ukip last week, is on course for a crushing victory over his former party in the October 9 by-election. But writing on the grassroots Tory website ConservativeHome, the MPs suggest there is a ‘real possibility’ that Mr Johnson could confound the polls and achieve a morale-boosting victory if he throws his hat into the ring. Mr Johnson is bidding to become the candidate for the safe Tory seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, in West London, but could, in theory, also apply for the nomination in Clacton. Mr Offord and Mr Stevenson say winning in Uxbridge would be ‘no great achievement’ for Mr Johnson and suggest he has a duty to try to save the Conservatives from a ‘potentially seismic’ defeat in Clacton. They write: ‘For Boris, this is an opportunity for him to step up to the plate, show his political courage, fight for the Conservative cause and clearly set out his willingness to play for the team. Were Boris to win, he would clearly have demonstrated his continuing ability to win difficult elections, as well as his ability to attract voters outside London. ‘For us, Boris has been an outstanding Mayor of London, but there have been doubts over his suitability as a potential future leader of the party. A win in Clacton could change that.’ Mr Johnson has dismissed suggestions he might stand in Clacton, saying he has already ‘whacked in’ an application to stand in Uxbridge.

"Fernando Alonso has accused the Italian media of attempting to destabilise Ferrari following the latest rumours linking him with a move away from the team. Earlier this week it was reported Alonso and Sebastian Vettel would swap teams for next season, despite the former having another two years remaining on his contract, whilst the latter has an additional year with Red Bull. Alonso is clearly becoming exasperated at the need to constantly fend off questions on the subject of whether he will leave Ferrari, more so than the team's lack of results as he is now without a win for 27 races, a statistic that often fuels the rumours regarding a potential departure. Fernando Alonso is committed to staying at Ferrari . The two-time world champion wonders around the paddock at the Singapore Grand Prix . Asked to clarify the situation ahead of Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix, Alonso said: 'I've been commenting about my future for 13 months now - since last August - so I have nothing new to say. 'Sometimes it's sad when it comes from Italy, or they create these rumours for some strange purpose which is not helping Ferrari, which is why we're all here. 'Ferrari is a much bigger brand than any individual person, or even Formula One in general. 'I respect Ferrari a lot and I try to create a good atmosphere in the team with the guys - from going out to dinner to playing basketball, playing poker, whatever - to ensure we are united. 'It's what we need, and it's what people expect from us driving for Ferrari and working for Ferrari. 'So when all these things come from Italy, it's not really clear what the purpose is. When we know then one day I will tell you.' Alonso's frustration is matched by Vettel, especially this season now he is on the back foot after four years of title glory. Alonso retires from the Italian Grand Prix at Monza earlier this month . Sebastian Vettel has reiterated his desire to stay at Red Bull . The German world champion flies around the track at Monza . Giving short shrift to the interviewer when quizzed on his future, Vettel said: 'I'm not thinking any differently to when I was asked the question a couple of weeks ago. 'I have a contract, and nothing has changed. The relationship I have with Red Bull is very special as they've been supporting me since I was 12 years old. 'Back then it was impossible to predict what would happen, that one day they would have their own team, or two Formula One teams. 'It was impossible to know I would be driving for one of them at some stage, or both of them. 'So it's impossible to predict the future. I've been with Red Bull a long time, I have a strong link to them, so in that regard nothing has changed, and doesn't look like it will change.'","Alonso accuses Italian media of attempting to destabilise Ferrari .

"The zebra crossing is facing extinction just as it prepares to celebrate its 60th anniversary in Britain, experts have revealed. The iconic crossing is being phased out and replaced with more sophisticated substitutes after a rise in deaths in the last four years. Ironically, the crossings were first introduced in Britain to tackle mounting road deaths in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Not so black and white: Many motorists do not heed the rules of the road when approaching the crossings, failing to give pedestrians right of way . But it seems the effectiveness of the crossing today could be in decline as it emerged many drivers fail to stop for pedestrians walking over the black and white painted pathway. The first zebra crossing was . officially opened in Slough, Berkshire, on October 31, 1951 and the . crossings have been a prominent feature of the British landscape for six . decades. However, during the last five years more than . 1,000 zebra crossings have vanished and many others have been replaced . by fewer more sophisticated alternatives with lights and flashing signs. Low fines and the reluctance of motorists to stop have also seen deaths on zebra crossings double in the last four years. Andrew Hammond, head of road safety at the AA, said: 'Zebra crossings are looked on as . inferior to other pedestrian crossings as there is no red light telling . cars to stop. 'In towns and villages there is a . pressure from residents for councils to fit pelican crossings as they . believe they are safer, so zebras are being phased out. Out with the old: Some places could soon be saying goodbye to the zebra's flashing warning beacon to make way for more modern pedestrian crossings . 'I suspect zebra crossings will . continue to have a role in some busy town centres where they can be . effective at helping people cross without constantly stopping the . traffic. 'But in villages and towns I think . they will eventually become extinct.' The Government decided to . introduce zebra crossings in 1951 as road traffic fatalities were . mounting. Post-war Britain only had 10 per cent . of its current traffic, but crossings were only marked with metal studs . in the road, which were easy for pedestrians to see, but difficult for . motorists. The Ministry of Transport experimented . with different pedestrian crossing markings to help improve visibility . and considered both blue and yellow stripes and even red and white . stripes. 'We need to put in the right type of crossing and make decisions . based on evidence not nostalgia' Black and white stripes were . eventually found to have the best visual impact and after they were . introduced pedestrian deaths dropped by 11 per cent in the first year. MP Jim Callaghan is credited with first noting the crossing's resemblance to a zebra and the name stuck. But despite their initial road safety . success, by 1960 more than 500 people died on zebra crossings in the UK . in just six months. This led to the introduction of the panda crossing in 1962, a signal controlled pedestrian crossing with lights. Government figures show five people . were killed on zebra crossings last year and 144 people were seriously . injured, compared to just three people who died in 2006. One reason for this is the fines in . Britain are considerably lower for a motorist prosecuted for not . stopping at a crossing compared to many other countries. Attraction: Every year hundreds of tourists recreate the famous Beatles album cover Abbey Road - arguably the most famous zebra crossing in the world . In the UK a motorist face a £60 fine . and three points on his or her driving licence.  But in Italy, for . example, the fine is anywhere from £111 to £443, while in Belgium the . maximum fine can reach more than £2,000. A zebra crossing costs about £10,000, . while pelican and puffin crossings - which are operated in part by the . pedestrian - cost around £35,000. Last year 24 people were killed at . pelican crossings, even though pedestrians feel safer if they have the . protection of a traffic light. Mr Hammond said the solution is having . more crossing points for pedestrians, even if they are not . fully-fledged zebras or pelicans. 'Zebra-crossings could be down-graded . so they indicate a good place for pedestrians to cross and motorists . know to watch out for them, but are not legally obliged to stop,' he . said. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said a lot had changed on the roads in the last 60 years. He added: 'Zebra crossings are iconic parts of the road network.

"Daniel Ricciardo still has designs on this year's Formula One world title, although appreciates his hopes are now 'distant'. Back-to-back victories either side of the summer break, as he took advantage of Mercedes duo Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg tripping over themselves, had propelled Ricciardo into contention. But around the lightning-fast, low-downforce Monza circuit in Italy earlier this month that played to Mercedes' strengths, Ricciardo and Red Bull were found wanting. DRed Bull's aniel Ricciardo (right) still has designs on this year's Formula One world title . An abysmal start did not help, and despite several stunning overtaking moves, Ricciardo finished fifth behind a Mercedes one-two spearheaded by Hamilton. Ahead of Sunday's grand prix under the lights in Singapore, Ricciardo trails Rosberg by 72 points and Hamilton by 50, but whilst there remains an opportunity, he will not be throwing in the towel. 'Ideally if we could head to Abu Dhabi (the final race where double points are on offer) within 50 points and have a chance then I think that will be a huge achievement no matter what happens,' said Ricciardo. 'To even just get to the last race and still be in with a shot would be awesome, which is the aim, but the approach is still race-by-race. 'I'm aware the title is distant, but we've some tracks now that suit us, and I've won some races this year so I know if I get in that position I've got a good chance of doing it again. 'All it takes is a couple of wins and a couple of bad races for the championship leader and all of a sudden everything's possible again, so let's see what happens.' Ricciardo has conceded patience will need to be his main ally this weekend at arguably the most demanding venue of the season. Back-to-back victories either side of the summer break have propelled Ricciardo into contention . 'When you walk around on Thursday the surface always looks pretty dirty,' said the Australian of the Marina Bay Street Circuit. 'Modern street races like this tend to wash and scrub the track, but even that doesn't really change the fact that what you're driving on is a public road with all the grit, grime and dirt that those have. 'It means you're in for a slithery, bumpy weekend - which I love! 'The important thing in Singapore is to not get caught chasing the set-up on a Friday. 'The track is going to evolve, so you've just got to be patient and let it happen without constantly tweaking your car, trying to hit a moving target. 'It's one of those races where you're never completely satisfied with the amount of preparation you do.'","Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosbery remain the favourites .

"The FIA has issued clarification with regard to the use of radio messages throughout future grands prix. Last week the FIA declared teams and drivers must strictly abide by one of the sporting regulations that states: 'The driver must drive the car alone and unaided.' Motorsport's world governing body believed information being relayed across the pit-to-car radio was making it too easy for drivers, and had gone beyond the spirit of the regulations. The FIA has now made clear what will and will not be tolerated, either via the radio or pit board . It resulted in Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff suggesting there would be confusion and controversy at upcoming races, with his team particularly affected given the battle between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg for this year's Formula One world title. In a bid to clear up some of the confusion, the FIA has now made clear what will and will not be tolerated, either via the radio or pit board. The messages to be banned include: sector time detail of a competitor and where a competitor is faster or slower; adjustment of power unit settings; adjustment of gearbox settings; information on differential settings; information on fuel flow settings and level of fuel saving needed and information on brake balance. On the formation lap ahead of a race there can be no information on clutch maps or settings, for example the bite point, or burn outs. Teams can no longer answer a direct question from a driver, such as 'Am I using the right torque map?', nor can there be any coded messages. Toto Wolff (above) suggested there would be confusion and controversy at upcoming races . From the Japanese Grand Prix onwards early next month teams will also be banned from informing drivers about tyre pressures or temperatures, and warnings as to brake wear or temperatures. For the avoidance of doubt, the FIA has ratified what messages can be relayed, and these include: acknowledgement a driver message has been heard; lap or sector time detail; lap time detail of a competitor; gaps to a competitor during a practice session or race. With regard to tyres drivers will be informed as to punctures, tyre choice at an upcoming pit stop, number of laps a competitor has done on a set of tyres during a race and tyre specification of a competitor. From the Japanese Grand Prix onwards teams will also be banned from informing drivers about tyre pressures or temperatures . Messages such as 'push hard', 'push now', 'you will be racing so and so' or similar are fine, whilst teams can also help by warning of traffic during a practice session or race. Information relating to gaps between cars in qualifying so as to better position a car for a clear lap is also permissible. Drivers can also be told of a potential problem with a competitor's car during a race, and of a competitor's likely race strategy. Finally, warnings with regard to yellow flags, blue flags, safety car deployments or other cautions, are also allowed.","FIA have clarified new radio message rule .

"Toro Rosso teenage prodigy Max Verstappen has earned lavish praise from all within the team following his first proper day behind the wheel. The 16-year-old, announced as a driver for next season by the Faenza-based squad last month, was left embarrassed a few days later when he crashed the car on a demonstration run in his native Rotterdam. On Wednesday, in a bid to earn his superlicence necessary to compete in F1, Verstappen did not put a wheel out of place around the Adria International Raceway in north-eastern Italy. 16-year-old Max Verstappen completed his first day behind the wheel of a Formula One car . Verstappen completed 148 laps of the circuit, clocking up just over 395 kilometres in a two-year-old car, enough to gain the superlicence, but more importantly earning the respect of his future employers. Sporting director Steve Nielsen said: 'In his first real test in a Formula One car, Max did a very competent job. 'He gave the impression he has been driving a Formula One car for quite a while, not like someone on their first day behind the wheel. 'He made no mistakes all day, seemed confident, and once he was told something he remembered it. In general, he coped very well with this first test.' Toro Rosso teenage prodigy Max Verstappen has earned lavish praise from all within the team . Race engineer Xevi Pujolar added: 'We worked through various procedures that make up a race weekend. He was very focused and precise and learned quickly, without having to ask many questions. 'Once we were able to fit slicks (tyres), he got used to the car in the dry and built up his speed, while we tried various fuel levels, replicating both qualifying and race trim, doing a mix of short and long runs. 'For a first day, it was very impressive.' As for Verstappen, he naturally savoured his experience, and is now itching to drive again, with the team planning a couple of runs in Friday practice sessions in the remaining grands prix this year. Race engineer Xevi Pujolar was impressed with the youngster, particularly considering it was his first day . Verstappen said: 'I was looking forward to my first drive in a Formula One car on a proper track and I really enjoyed it. 'It was a good opportunity to work with Xevi, who will be my race engineer next year, as well as having a chance to get used to all the buttons on the steering wheel.

"Kirstie Allsopp is on a mission. Earlier this year, the star came under attack for claiming that women should put off careers and focus on having children in their twenties, because it's much harder to get pregnant later on. But the mother-of-two is undeterred and yesterday evening at special talk in London she was once again warning British ladies about the perils of leaving it until your late thirties to start a family. She said: 'The facts cannot be got away from. You have a 10 per cent chance of conceiving a child over 40. I don't say this smugly - I got in just under the wire. 'I think women are being lied to. 'It gets more and more difficult to have children over the age of 35. 'Plenty of women don't want children, that's fine - but if you do, you need to know the facts.' Scroll down for video . Kirstie Allsopp wants women to be aware of the dangers of delaying having babies later in life. The TV presenter is suggesting that girls delay university and careers and have their children first . The Location, Location, Location presenter was talking about the perils of late motherhood as part of a  Stylist magazine Life Lessons talk in London yesterday. Kirstie advised women to think seriously about delaying university until after their children are born. She said:  'I want to say to women: be honest with each other, with your partners, daughters and sons - know that you can have careers at any age, you can go to uni at any age. 'You can do a thousand brilliant things at any age. But just for now, we haven't opened the fertility window any wider. 'It is easier and simpler and less of a heartache to just have children when our bodies allow us to. 'Nature is not a feminist and that's just the truth.' Although Kirstie's comments on fertility were heavily criticised by certain feminist corners when she first made them this year, the star isn't alone in her opinions. Her views are backed up by the latest research figures from the University of St Andrews and Edinburgh University, which show that the average woman aged 30 only has 12 per cent of her eggs left, while a woman turning forty has only three per cent left in her reserves. On top of that, data from the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology shows IVF had a global failure rate of 77 per cent in 2012. IVF can put an immense pressure on a relationship, with the procedure tripling the likelihood of divorce (picture posed by models) Jody Day is the founder of Gateway Women, a support network for childless women in the UK who believes too many older women think IVF will come to their rescue. Jody started trying for a baby with her husband aged 29, but the marriage broke down in her late-thirties. She hoped to meet a new partner and try IVF but a suitable relationship did not materialise. At the age of 43 she found herself single again and had to begin the process of grieving and accepting her childlessness. Now she has built a community of women who share her situation. She runs workshops and retreats in London and Oxfordshire helping women who are also making the transition to a life without the family they hoped for. Jody predicts that the country is sitting on a ticking time bomb of women who are delaying pregnancy until it's too late. She said: 'Social infertility is the biggest thing for the next generation. 'In one generation, the worst social stereotype has gone from being a single mother to a woman over 40 without children. 'We see people conceiving in their forties, but they're extremely lucky, it's this mythical age. Jody Day is the founder of Gateway Women, a support network for childless women in the UK . 'In one generation we've had access to all of these things that give freedom to women; access to abortion, access to higher education, access to professions and legal access to birth control. 'But fertility is not a feminist, it is focused on us having children when we're young.' The problem doesn't just lie with delaying pregnancy though, it is also our belief that IVF is going to be the solution. Much is written about the difficulty of going through in vitro fertilization, but Jody feels there isn't enough discussed with potential patients about how low the chances of success really are. She said: 'Most of us get an education from the miracle stories - there is very little awareness that globally 77 per cent of IVF has failed. 'Most women who are struggling to conceive don't know that there is a five per cent success rate for women aged 43-44, that becomes under two per cent success for women 44 and over. Artificial insemination of a human female egg - the process has a 77 per cent global failure rate . At Jody's Gateway Women community, thousands of women come together for support. She said: 'If you're childless and a single woman, it's shameful, it's like you're not a real woman, it's like you've failed. 'Whenever I'm in the media, there's a huge response, it shows people have been reached. 'I'm doing it so there is a resource there that wasn't there when I needed it. 'I'm just one individual but I'm looking after so many women, because there is so little information out there about it - that's a taboo for you.' But while there is little that women can do to control the amount of eggs the lose during the ageing process, fertility clinics are keen to point out that they can be very successful in offering other solutions. Freezing eggs is encouraged egg donors are also suggested as a crucial option for women who are struggling to conceive. More and more women are now putting off having babies until their forties . Dr Geetha Venkat is Medical Director of the Harley Street Fertility Clinic, a practice which makes patients aware very early on in fertility treatments of all of the options available. She said: 'It is true, that a significant group of our patients are women over 40 years of age. In the last few years, we have seen the number of women in this age category coming to the clinic for fertility treatment dramatically rise. 'However, as the saying goes ‘time and tide wait for none’. 'To avoid this desperate situation, women need to be aware first and foremost and should be encouraged to freeze their eggs in their twenties and early thirties if they are going to delay childbearing. '(And) Women in their forties can improve their fertility by leading a healthy lifestyle including eating a balanced diet with high protein and high fibre, exercising regularly and avoiding smoking, drinking and using recreational drugs.' A  spokesperson for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has also cautioned that success rate for IVF have improved dramatically in recent years. They said: 'While IVF techniques have progressed significantly in the last 20-30 years and are improving all the time, it is important to remember that IVF does not guarantee success. 'Fertility levels drop significantly when a woman passes her mid-30s, and we would always encourage women to inform themselves of the facts around fertility and IVF - as the fact is that the chance of success for a woman of 35 is around one in three. 'It is also very important that women discuss their options with clinicians, to ensure any treatment is suited to their circumstances.' Jody Day believes that girls and boys should be taught about fertility alongside sex education at school . However, there is no getting away from the fact that for women to be aware that they should even be freezing their eggs in the late twenties, they need to be better educated about fertility. Jody Day is now campaigning for fertility to be taught in schools alongside sex education, so that both men and women are aware of the situation when they are growing up. She said: 'Statistically, if you're talking to a group of teenagers, it is more likely that they are going to have fertility problems than that they are going to have a child before they are 18. 'What women have done in our generation is we have gone into a professional working world that is built around the male template of fertility, which is to work really hard in your twenties and thirties and have a family in your forties. 'We have adopted a male pattern of working and it doesn't fit female fertility. 'We need to have some very big changes in the way our society is structured if women are going to be able to have children.' Jody Day has written the book: .

"Chilling: Rick J. Jones is accused of stabbing his friend several times after an argument . This terrifying mugshot shows the man accused of stabbing his friend multiple times and leaving him covered in blood as he went on the run in West Virginia last week. Rick J. Jones, 33, of the Frog Level Section of Coalwood, McDowell County, was snapped peering into the camera with just one eye open, the rest of his face appearing bruised, scabbed and contorted. He is said to have launched the brutal attack following a verbal altercation while at his friend's house on Friday night. The victim, Kevin Ross, suffered lacerations to his lower torso, his left side, his back and the lower part of his right arm and 'had blood covering most of his body. Police found the victim in the seriously injured state, accompanied by his wife, after they were called out at 11pm. After allegedly stabbing his friend several times, Jones made his way to a house belonging to his father, Rick L Jones, before leaving the property armed with a .40 caliber handgun - just minutes before police arrived. Following a manhunt which went on throughout the night, Jones returned to his father's house on Saturday morning - where he was arrested by police, The Register Herald reports. He has been charged with malicious wounding, domestic assault, domestic battery and brandishing and is currently in custody at the McDowell County holding facility. He appeared for his arraignment on Saturday before McDowell County Magistrate, Steve Cox, who set his bond at $25,000 cash and property.

"Every time I say I believe in God, people look a bit embarrassed. It’s become one of those subjects most people don’t want to discuss. We can talk face-to-face and chat online about our sex lives, our children and our fantasy partners, but we hesitate to reveal whether we believe in life after death. At Easter, the most important religious festival for Christians, politicians go through hoops to avoid talk of the G (God) word, for fear of alienating voters. Although Ed Miliband (left) has been visiting relatives in Israel, he calls himself a Jewish atheist. Janet Street-Porter believes it is refreshing to hear David Cameron (right)  admit he uses the Church as a support system . Ed Miliband, who has been visiting relatives in Israel, says he hopes to become the first Jewish prime minister. He was born into a Jewish family, but says he doesn’t believe in God — calling himself a Jewish atheist. I struggle with that; it’s religion-lite. How do other Jews feel about someone who is Jewish, but doesn’t believe in God? Isn’t it a bit of a pick ’n’ mix approach to fundamentals? I imagine some are highly offended. Nick Clegg says he doesn’t believe in God, but his three sons are being brought up as Catholics to please his wife. Cleggers seems wet, as usual — I suspect he’s an atheist because he (mistakenly) believes it will offend the least number of people. But, whether you are a Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim or Anglican, you believe in something, a higher power. Clegg has made the wrong call. Tony Blair also brought up his children as Catholics to please Cherie, and made quite a show of his spirituality whenever I went to interview him. Since leaving office he has attended Mass regularly, but hasn’t commented on his faith since Alastair Campbell once famously remarked that ‘we don’t do God’. Refreshingly, David Cameron recently admitted he turns to the Church for support in difficult times — most notably after his son Ivan’s sad death.  Cameron says he finds ‘a little bit of peace and hopefully a little bit of guidance’ when he attends Holy Communion at the church attached to his children’s Church of England school. Cameron doesn’t flaunt his beliefs — he’s a typical, slightly embarrassed Anglican, who turns up in church at feasts and festivals and only prays when the proverbial has hit the fan. There’s nothing wrong in that. I’m just pleased that Cameron, who regularly attends state events with leaders of the Anglican Church and the Royal Family, isn’t one of the two-faced cynics in government and is happy to say he believes in God. In our modern world of sneerers, that takes a lot  of guts. Janet Street-Porter could not resist a quick snap by this funny sign . I’ve just started filming a new BBC1 series about food with lovely chef Brian Turner. Last week we were in Rye, where our hotel was of the Basil Fawlty variety. I asked for an extra light for my dimly lit room — it never arrived. I asked for plain yoghurt — they didn’t have any. When we went for breakfast at 7.30am they were still putting out the buffet and there was no one to take our order. The walls were so thin I could hear a couple sneezing next door and someone going to the loo upstairs. Luckily, the countryside  is divine and I couldn’t resist a quick snap by this sign: please don’t send in your comments! I resisted the urge to paint out the letters ‘WO’. Sat Navs irritate me, it doesn’t matter which voice I set, patronising female or prissy bloke. It’s the way they repeat instructions over and over, as if the driver is utterly dumb — I’ve even started talking to my partner like a sat nav, repeating all instructions (ie orders), such as ‘take the rubbish out’, three times. Now, inventors in India have developed sat nav shoes — which come with an app that can be downloaded to a smartphone. Not impressed: Inventors in India have developed sat nav shoes . Using a Bluetooth link to communicate with the phone-mapping system, the shoes emit a buzz if you go in the wrong direction. They can even be programmed to monitor how many calories you’re burning, like my Fitbit, which is ‘resting’ on a shelf because I don’t want to fail at more than one thing a day. Maps are the joy of my life — I have collected hundreds over the years, and the last thing I need is a clever shoe. Sadly, map sales have plummeted by 40 per cent  thanks to sat navs, and in  future Ordnance Survey will only print some on demand. GPS devices don’t make  for enjoyable walking —  why spend your time staring at a screen when you can read a map and then pop it in your pocket? When I started presenting telly shows in 1975, the studio complexes had bars that were open all day and people drank vast amounts. I don’t know how any work got done after 3pm. Now, it’s very different. Working in a TV studio is like going into a factory. The bars have closed. People grab a sandwich, dressing rooms get used for two or three different shows a day. The only time you might get a glass of cheap wine is after recording has finished around 10pm. Back in the Seventies, filming on location, we stopped for a proper lunch; now, we grab something quick on the go as budgets have been slashed and working  days extended. Cleared: Nigel Evans . This has been my experience of the past 40 years, so I was nauseated to read about what goes on in Westminster — researchers and MPs groping and getting sloshed night after night. It sounds as if they are living in a time warp. Former Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans, cleared of sex allegations, now says he was ‘drunk from time to time . . . but not plastered every night’. Even so, I’d like to know why taxpayers are subsidising bars and canteens in Westminster. I’d close half the bars for good, shut the rest during the day and charge premium prices. As for canteens, most of us get a quick lunch at M&S, Pret or Greggs. Why should MPs be any different? Fern Britton (pictured) is hosting the new BBC follow-up to Bake Off: The Great Allotment Challenge . The sun came out at the weekend, so I succumbed to garden centre impulse purchasing. You know the story — a trip to get one ‘essential’ (cleaner to remove the green slime brought on by the wet winter from the patio) ends up with me pushing a trolley full of plants and a bill for £83. How did that happen? Tomorrow sees the start of National Gardening Week, with events taking place up and down the country, from Woking to Wrexham, Harrogate to Handcross. Experts are on call to answer queries and before next Friday I am bound to be back at another garden centre buying even more plants. Tomorrow, the BBC is kicking off its much-publicised follow-up to Bake Off, the Great Allotment Challenge, hosted by Fern Britton, with a judging panel including the Queen’s former head gardener. I come from a family  of vegetable growers: my paternal grandfather and father spent every free hour digging, nurturing rows of potatoes, leeks, wonderful  lettuces and carrots, probably as a way to escape their carping wives. I’ve already planted out some broad beans on my  plot in Yorkshire, as well as cabbages, leeks, lettuces  and onions. Baby beetroot plants are on stand-by in the cold frame. It could hail or snow right up to early May and I could lose the lot, but that’s the risk we brave gardeners are prepared to take to get ahead. If the temperature drops, I shall be swaddling the plants in fleece and polythene, and telling them to buck up. It’s weird the BBC are launching this show when we are eating less fruit and veg than ever — on average, just 3.9 portions out of our recommended five a day. Meanwhile, some experts think five is not enough, claiming we really need seven or even ten. I think Fern will be presiding over the green  fingers equivalent of cookery porn: we’ll be salivating  over the marrows and aubergines, but how many viewers will eat them, let alone  grow them from scratch? Very few.","David Cameron admits he turns to the Church for support in difficult times .

"A TV commercial featuring the presenter on ITV’s This Morning, Ruth Langsford, who heralded the benefits of eye correction surgery, has been banned. The wife of fellow TV celebrity Eamonn Holmes appeared in a commercial for an eye lens replacement treatment sold under the Clarivu brand. The 53-year-old presenter said she had been able to throw away her glasses after having the treatment, which claims to restore both long and short sight. Scroll down for video . This Morning host Ruth Langsford said she had been able to throw away her glasses after having the treatment which claims to restore both long and short sight . However, an eye specialist complained that there is no guarantee patients will not need glasses, particularly for reading, after the treatment. Now the Advertising Standards Authority(ASA) has banned the commercial on the grounds it was misleading. The Clarivu surgery is most effective for people over 50 who cannot be helped by laser eye surgery. It involves removing the lens at the front of the eye and replacing it with a synthetic multifocal alternative. In theory, the surgery, which costs £3,495 per eye, means people can see items that are close up or far away. Claims: But the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned the commercial on the grounds it was misleading . Miss Langsford was featured in the . commercial saying: ‘As a TV Presenter it was so frustrating having to . rely on glasses and contact lenses, but for me laser eye surgery wasn't . suitable. 'Then I discovered Clarivu from the eyecare experts at Optegra. ‘Clarivu corrects both long and short sightedness in a proven and permanent lens replacement procedure. Ms Langsford and her fellow morning television presenter husband Eamonn Holmes . ‘Clarivu has changed my life forever.  Goodbye glasses, hello Clarivu. See my story at Optegra.com.’ Optegra provided a raft of independent research and clinical evidence to demonstrate the success of advanced intra-ocular lenses (IOL) in providing near, intermediate and distance vision correction. It said that Clarivu represented a new category of eye surgery ‒ refractive lens exchange for those over 50 years of age ‒ which did not exist before. However, the eye specialist told the ASA  that his understanding was that the multifocal lenses could not yet provide the full range of near vision correction to remove the need for glasses. The watchdog said it did accept that there is good evidence to believe the replacement lenses ‘could provide sufficient correction of both long and short distance vision to the extent that many patients would no longer require glasses or contact lenses’. However, it said this was not guaranteed for all patients. Consequently, it concluded that the claims made by Miss Langsford and Optegra were misleading. The ASA said: ‘The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Optegra UK Ltd not to imply that all consumers who underwent the Clarivu procedure would no longer require glasses or contact lenses after the procedure if that was not the case.’ As a result Optegra edited their advertisement and an amended version of it is now running. Today Optegra released a statement saying: 'Following comments from the ASA, an amended version of the Clarivu advert featuring Ruth Langsford was resubmitted, received ASA and industry approval, and has been broadcasting on ITV since 27 January. 'Optegra has a rigorous clinical evaluation and consenting process with all patients carried out by our expert ophthalmic surgeons.  All risks and benefits associated with all eye surgery are made clear at the point of consultation ahead of consent. 'The advert features Ruth Langsford’s personal experience as a patient. Like the vast majority of our Clarivu patients, Ruth achieved 20/20 vision after the Clarivu procedure, and is delighted to be free of glasses.  The procedure is not suitable for everyone and will depend on the individual patient’s vision and lifestyle needs.

"Jos Buttler begins his Test career as England’s wicket-keeper batsman on Sunday but just a few years ago the former child prodigy was a reluctant gloveman. The 23-year-old former Somerset star — whose remarkable ball-striking ability has drawn comparisons with Viv Richards and Ian Botham — caught the attention of England’s hierarchy at a early age, once scoring 227 not out for his school first XI in a record 340-run partnership in 2008. The player who had the best view in the house that day, former school friend and current Somerset batsman Alex Barrow, says the man making his Test debut in place of 79-cap veteran Matt Prior today was not always a willing wicket-keeper. Catching practice: Jos Buttler in an England nets session on Saturday . Debutant: He is set to make his Test bow for England against India on Sunday . ‘Jos was actually very reluctant to keep at school,’ Barrow said. ‘On several occasions he’d hand the gloves over to someone else so he could have a bowl. He was a very good keeper but didn’t really enjoy it. 'He didn’t really want to do it but he’s come on a long way and done a huge amount of work which is testament to him for becoming a Test keeper. But there were many times at school he didn’t fancy it.’ With his opportunities at Taunton limited by former England keeper Craig Kieswetter, Buttler moved to Lancashire from Somerset this winter to gain regular wicket-keeping opportunities at first-class level. He has worked tirelessly with wicketkeeping coach Bruce French and is entrusted with the gloves at the Ageas Bowl following Prior’s decision to take a break. He is the least experienced wicketkeeper England have selected in the past 50 years in terms of first-class appearances, apart from Essex skipper James Foster who made his Test debut against India in 2001. Buttler’s one-day credentials are already established and his astonishing innings of 121 from 74 balls in a losing cause against Sri Lanka at Lord’s in May led to calls from many — including Kevin Pietersen — for him to be elevated even sooner. ‘Jos’s ball-striking was always pretty exceptional,’ said Barrow. ‘He was able to clear the boarding house at one end and the science block from the first XI square at school, which was around a 100m carry. 'No-one else could get close but Jos could hit it over pretty regularly and pretty comfortably. He could always hit the ball a long way. He could also always hit the ball in strange areas, too. ‘We batted together in a Twenty20 tournament at Millfield and he walked down the wicket to me in one game and said “I’m going to try to hit this guy over point for six”. In my naivety I wondered how the hell he was going to cut the ball for six, but the next ball he came down and he said: “I’m going to reverse sweep him for six”. And that’s exactly what he did. It was pretty amazing. ‘He spent a lot more time practising those sorts of skills at a younger age than most other people.’ Pedigree: He is already established in limited overs cricket for England . Backup: In training with captain Alastair Cook (centre) and Chris Jordan (right) Buttler’s parents, John and  Patricia, will be at the Ageas Bowl today to witness his Test debut. ‘Jos was a bowler at a young age but when one of his team’s wicket keepers was ill and the other was injured on that day, Jos took over, and that was it,’ John told the Mail on Sunday. ‘One thing that he has had ever since he was born is incredible hand-eye co-ordination. It means if there’s something to be hit or something to be caught, he has the natural ability to do it.’ Jos honed his skills as a youngster by playing against his older brother James, seven years his senior, in the garden of their family home in the Somerset village of Wedmore. Patricia said: ‘We had a mown strip up the top of the garden and they would charge in at each other, smashing around the place. Windows were broken, the greenhouse was in pieces but they played and played. ‘Because there were so many years between them, if Jos wanted to play he had to play as hard as his older brother. They were so competitive and still are. They still play whenever they’re both here. ‘People have told us that Jos is the same as Kevin Pietersen. They go because he’s playing, he’s got something special to inspire a crowd.’ Buttler turned down the chance to be a school prefect in order to concentrate on his cricket and A-Levels in his final year at King’s, Taunton, a West Country boarding school he attended through a cricket scholarship won aged 13. ‘He was an unbelievable cricketer and clearly a class above everybody else,’ said headmaster Richard Biggs. ‘There was no doubt he would go on to succeed in the game. But he wasn’t just a cricketer, he was also an exceptionally talented rugby player who I have no doubt could have gone on to make a living out of that. He played hockey very well and was also a bright boy who did very well in his A-Levels. ‘He was modest, softly spoken and a great ambassador for the school. The only place he pushed himself on to the centre stage was on the cricket field. He was never arrogant and everybody liked him.’ Batsman: According to a school friend, he was a reluctant wicketkeeper growing up . Safe hands: But he has been working hard with Somerset to prepare for his chance when it comes . Buttler was soon on Somerset’s radar where former England batsman Brian Rose — county captain in the late Seventies of a side containing Botham and Richards — immediately spotted his promise. ‘I was fortunate enough at Somerset to see Ian Botham emerging and one or two others,’ said Rose. ‘I’ve seen Jos play cricket since he was 13 and it was immediately apparent to me he was going to play at the highest level. ‘There are not many people you can say that about. People as talented as Jos will always get through. 'His hand-eye co-ordination and ability to hit the ball anywhere in the ground takes me back a long time to when I was watching people like Ian Botham and Viv Richards, one of the greatest cricketers ever to play. ‘I think Jos has that special ability. His big challenge is to bat for longer periods in first-class cricket.’ At just under six feet, Buttler is relatively tall for a wicket-keeper. ‘Initially I doubted he’d be a wicketkeeper because of his height,’ Rose added. ‘But he’s naturally flexible and is good on his feet. His glovework has come on a lot and he’s been helped a lot by Frenchy over the last couple of years. ‘He’s a natural athlete so the more he keeps practising with soft hands he’ll be fine.’","Buttler was a reluctant wicketkeeper when he was growing up .

"Elderly actors who played Munchkins in The Wizard of Oz have told of their shock at the campaign to propel Ding Dong!

Mr Maren, who also appeared in the Judy Garland film, agreed, adding: 'It is shocking that the song is being used to celebrate the death of someone.' He described Baroness Thatcher as a 'great lady'. The pair spoke out after the BBC was accused of fudging the decision over whether to play the track during the chart show on Radio 1 this weekend.

"At the end of a low scoring week at the picturesque Golfclub Schloss Finkenstein, Moritz Lampert was left holding the trophy aloft as winner of the Karnten Golf Open presented by Mazda. Seven birdies and just a single dropped shot added up to a round of 65 on Sunday as the German posted a 19 under par total to win by a stroke from playing partner Byeong-hun An, with Italy’s Filippo Bergamaschi a shot further back in third position. This latest success for Lampert, who won his first professional title earlier this year on the Pro Golf Tour, means the 22-year-old will now have a full category on the Challenge Tour for the rest of the year. It will allow the German to plan a proper schedule, and it also sees him jump to fifth on the Rankings, with the top 15 earning their place on The European Tour come the end of the season. All smiles: Moritz Lampert holds his prize aloft after sealing victory in the Karnten Golf Open . Having just received the trophy, and a rather large cheque for €25,600 at the presentation on the 18th green, Lampert was clearly over the moon with his success. 'This is pretty cool,' said the German, who represents Golf Club St Leon-Rot, part of The European Tour Properties network. 'My first round wasn’t that great, but since then I have played some really good golf, and for it to turn into a victory this week, well, I can’t put it into words. It is my first victory, which makes it special, because I have been playing on invites up until now and this just changes my whole schedule, my season, and my goals. 'It’s easy to say now that I saw it coming, but I felt like I was playing well again, and have been hitting the ball like I wanted to. To win takes so much more than just playing well though, as there are so many good guys out here, so you could say I got lucky in the end, as I holed a great putt on 15 to win by one.

On Tuesday I go to Czech, so tomorrow will be the day to celebrate. I don’t know what it will be, but I’m sure my family and my girlfriend will figure something out.' Coming up just short of Lampert’s winning total was Korea’s An, who birdied his final three holes on Sunday to match his best ever finish on the Challenge Tour, which came at the Scottish Hydro Challenge hosted by Macdonald Hotels and Resorts last June. While some players might be disappointed to come up just shy of a maiden title, the 22 year old Orlando resident was excited to continue a run of consistent form. 'I played alright today,' said An. 'Five under is always a decent score, Mo just played great today. I tried my best, and I’m quite happy with my finish, especially making those birdies in the last few holes. 'I’m getting closer to winning, I’ve still got plenty of golf ahead of me, and I think it’s coming. It is better to play more consistent in my opinion, rather than win and then not play well. I’d rather do that, play well every week, still trying to win. I am very happy with a second place finish.' On his own in third place was Bergamaschi, who fired a four under par 67 on Sunday to continue a fine run of form in this event, having finished second 12 months ago. The Italian finished a stroke clear of overnight leader Cyril Bouniol, who posted his best result of a maiden Challenge Tour campaign by finishing in a tie for fourth, thanks to a Sunday 69 in Carinthia. Alongside him were Jake Roos (66), who won the opening event of the season at the Barclays Kenya Open in March, as well as Germany’s Florian Fritsch (68), who had lead in the early stages of the final round. A shot further back were Scotland’s Wallace Booth, who shot a 64 in the final round to move into a tie for seventh with the English pair of Sam Hutsby (65) and Paul Maddy (69), as well as Irishman Ruaidhri McGee (67).","Moritz Lampert claims maiden Challenge Tour title .

"The remains of over 400 Red Army soldiers who fought and died in the Korean War will finally be returned to China for burial - 60 years after the end of the conflict. These extraordinary pictures show Chinese government officials observing the remains of 437 Chinese soldiers at a cemetery in Paju, South Korea - all of whom were killed in the Korean War. Communist China sent troops to fight alongside North Korean soldiers during the 1950-53 conflict - which was the primary result of the political division of the country following the Second World War. A Chinese military officer observes the remains of Red Army soldiers at a cemetery in Paju, South Korea. The skeletons of 437 men will be returned to China, having laid at the cemetery for over 60 years . The remains of the men, pictured, along with their helmets, ID papers and personal belongings were placed into coffins this afternoon and will now return to China . They fought against the South Korean army which was . backed by the United States and other Western powers. Thousands of men from The Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) perished on the Korean Peninsula during the war -  which ended in armistice following two years of negotiations. Chinese troops were lumbered with poor military equipment and suffered from serious logistical problems - meaning a large number of men were lost during the conflict. Some argue the conflict has never truly been resolved, however - especially following a series of incursions and acts of aggression from the North. Today, the remains - as well as the soldier's clothes, helmets and other personal belongings - were put in coffins ahead of their planned repatriation to China. Communist China sent thousands of troops to fight alongside the North Koreans in the 1950-3 conflict. They fought against South Korean and UN troops in the war - which began following the political division of the country in the Second World War . The men's remains are wrapped and put in to coffins. Despite being great in number, Chinese troops had poor equipment and so many died in conflict . About 55 men had their identification records attached to them. Seoul and Beijing made an agreement in 2013 to return the Chinese soldiers' bodies which have been buried in the Paju cemetery for many years. It came after Park Geun-hye, South Korean president, visited China in June last year. The removal of the bodies began in . December last year - with the process taking several months as the . skeletons needed to be cleaned and dried. Both South Korean and Chinese officials attended the coffin ceremony today  in Paju, a town near the demilitarized zone with North Korea. The removal of the bodies began in December last year - with the process taking several months as the skeletons needed to be cleaned and dried . An agreement was made to return the remains last year following the South Korean president's visit to China . Li Guiguang, an official from China's ministry of civil affair, told People Daily: 'We want to express our deep gratitude . to South Korean government and all the people who have contributed to . the return of the remains of Chinese soldiers.' He say the ceremony marked a good day in terms of relations between the two sides . 'The return of Chinese soldiers' remains was a milestone of healing the wounds of war both countries suffered,' Moon Sang Gyun, an official from South Korean defense ministry, added. The bodies are not the first to be returned to China. It is thought 43 remains of Chinese soldiers have been returned via the United Nations Military Armistice Commission since 1981. The Korean War was a conflict between the Republic of Korea  - now South Korea - who were backed by the United Nations, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  - now North Korea - supported at points by China and the Soviet Union. It was the result, primarily at least, of Korea's division following the Second World War. The Korean Peninsula was ruled by Japan from 1910 until 1945. Following the country's surrender in September of that year - officials from the US cut up the peninsula along the 38th parallel. South Korean soldiers move in single file toward Korea's east-central front near Lookout Mountain, east of the Pukhan River, 1953 . The US occupied the southern area and Soviet forces took the north. The sense of division between the two areas was intensified when, in 1948, the North established a communist government and the south, a right-wing ruling system. Over time, the 38th parallel became an increasingly political border - with negotiations following the war for reunification of the two areas causing more tension than solutions. On June 25 1950 open warfare began when North Korean forces invaded the south. The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution shortly afterwards authorising military intervention. Men of the US Army pictured loaded on trucks for transport up to the firing line during the Korean War . The US provided a vast majority of the soldiers who aided the South Korean forces, with men from twenties other countries also drafted in. The North Koreans were pushed back past the 38th parallel before China stepped in - forcing southern forces to retreat back over the division. The fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when an armistice agreement was signed after long and troublesome negotiations. The agreement restored the original borders and created the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which acts as a 2.5-mile buffer zone between the nations. Minor incidents still continue today.","Remains of 437 Chinese soldiers to be returned from South Korea .

"This is Gold Base, the secret desert HQ of the Scientology Church and the controversial Sea Org group, reportedly central to Katie Holmes’s marital split from Tom Cruise. Ominously for those inside, the razor-sharp fences surrounding the 700-acre compound of Gold Base have spikes pointing in both directions. With motion sensors along the perimeter and a camouflaged sniper bunker hidden in the hillside above, it is unclear whether the prison-style security is to keep people out or to keep them in — or both. The base, surrounded by hills near the town of Hemet in southern California, was for decades a secret even to most Scientologists. But now it has been thrust into the spotlight amid claims that Holmes ended her six-year-marriage to the Mission Impossible star over fears that he wanted to send their daughter Suri to join Sea Org. Although Suri is only six and Sea . Org  usually recruits young people over 16, Cruise — yesterday named the . highest-paid Hollywood star after earning £47 million last year — holds . enormous sway in the church and would have no problem pulling strings. But Sea Org’s dire reputation is . enough to give any mother palpitations. Its members wear naval uniforms, . use military ranks and are expected to salute to senior church members . like Cruise and call them ‘sir’. Outraged former members say that . conditions are anything but fraternal and have painted Sea Org — which . stands for Sea Organisation, a reference to the church’s early days . sailing the globe on ships — as slavery by another name. Some 800 of the 6,000 Sea Org members are at Gold Base at any given time, but all of them can expect . to spend some of their toughest years in the church there. Formerly a resort popular with the . Hollywood industry and known by the unfortunate title of Massacre . Canyon after an old Indian tribal battle, Gold Base was bought by the . church in 1978. It has since spent at least £30 million redeveloping it. Enclave: Gold Base, the Scientology camp on a 500-acre compound at San Jacinto in Riverside County, California . All aboard: The masts of a ship-like structure next to a swimming pool at the isolated Gold Base compound in the Californian wilderness . Headquarters: The Scientology base in California has a church, mansion, golf course accommodation and swimming pool . Spiritual home: The $9.4million mansion which former members claim was built for the return of L. Ron  Hubbard who died in 1986 . The site boasts comfortable villas . where the group’s authoritarian leader David Miscavige and other senior . Scientologists live and work, a castle-style film studio that  produces . propaganda, a huge church, a ship-themed swimming pool, a golf course . and the mansion of the late Scientology founder, L. Ron Hubbard. The latter, the grand house at the . top of the compound called Bonnie View, is now a museum but is . reportedly kept fully staffed and furnished. Scientologists believe in . reincarnation, and hope Hubbard may some day return. Ex-Sea Org members claim  they were continually forced to work 20-hour days for just room, board and a weekly allowance of £15. Physical relationships, marriage and . especially childbirth are said to be discouraged as they are seen as a . distraction from Sea Org’s arduous work running the Scientology . organisation. Recruits sign billion-year contracts . because — as Scientologists believe in reincarnation — they are expected . to return to Sea Org in future lives. When they have tried to leave, some . Sea Orgers — as members are called — have said the church has given them . a bill for tens of thousands of dollars for the teaching and training . they received while serving in Sea Org.

Church leaders at Gold Base are . allegedly encouraged to instil  aggressive, even violent discipline on . the compound both with Sea Org foot soldiers and other visiting church . members. Those who fail to submit are . reportedly punished in ‘the Hole’, a pair of extra-wide mobile homes on . Gold Base used as a prison block for Scientologists who have in some way . offended their leaders. Although the church denies the . existence of such a place and some believe the buildings have been . removed, a string of former Scientologists have come forward to detail . the abuse they allege went on there. Mark ‘Marty’ Rathbun, once the . second most powerful figure in the church — but who later fell out with . the organisation and fled from the base — told a court that between 80 . and 100 Scientologists were  sentenced to the Hole at a time and were . required to do group confessions all day and all night. He claimed that, one night, . Miscavige visited the Hole and organised a brutal game of musical . chairs. Putting the Queen song Bohemian Rhapsody on the sound system, he . announced that only the winner would be allowed to remain a member of . the church, prompting a desperate fight as Scientologists came to blows . over the chairs. The church has denied all allegations, saying that Rathbun was ‘delusional’. Earlier this year, another high- . profile Scientologist defector,  Debbie Cook, tearfully told a court how . in 2007 she and fellow ‘Holees’ at Gold Base — including church . management from as far afield as France and Australia — were forced to . share a single conference room with cubicles and office spaces around . it.

Residents also have access to a sprawling and well-kept golf course, that's part of the Gold Base compound . There were bars on the windows and the only exit was guarded 24 hours a day by church security men, she said. Meals were a ‘slop’ of reheated . leftovers, such as beans and rice, barely providing enough energy for . the days’ main activity — hurling abuse at each other in often violent . confessionals designed to get them to admit ill-feeling towards . Miscavige. She described her own 12-hour ordeal . as she was forced to stand in a large rubbish bin while the 100 other . inmates poured water over her and screamed in her face that she was a . lesbian. ‘You ate there, you slept there on . the floor and you never left with the exception of a brief period to go . take a shower,’ she said, adding that the place was infested with ants. At one point, Miscavige is said to . have piled on the discomfort by turning off the electricity — and . therefore the air-conditioning — for two weeks, making the temperature . inside the Hole soar to 106F (41C). Rank-and-file Sea Org members  toiling away at Gold Base are similarly vulnerable to abuse, some of them claim. Marc Headley, who spent 15 years in . Sea Org, recounted how under- performers at Gold Base were  frequently . sent to work-camps, where they would be humiliated. He recounted how he and many  others . once had to spend several days in the blistering desert heat chipping . out several feet of solidified waste from a dried-out sewage lake.

"A congressional candidate running as a Republican in the upcoming Illinois primary says the 'Holocaust never happened.' Arthur Jones, 64, who organizes neo-Nazi events around Adolf Hitler’s birthday, hopes to be the Republican candidate chosen to run against Rep. Dan Lipinski in Illinois’ 3rd Congressional District. ‘As far as I’m concerned, the Holocaust is nothing more than an international extortion racket by the Jews,’ Jones said. Controversial: Arthur Jones, a candidate running as a Republican in the Illinois primary, is a Holocaust denier . ‘It’s the blackest lie in history. Millions of dollars are being made by Jews telling this tale of woe and misfortune in books, movies, plays and TV. The more survivors, the more lies that are told.’ Holocaust denial is illegal in a number of European countries and carries a prison sentence for people who break the law. Jones, a Vietnam War veteran, was previously a member of the Nationalist Socialist White People's Party and has taken part in a Nazi march. 'Philosophically, I’m a National Socialist,' Jones said. 'Officially, I don’t belong to any party except my own, the America First Committee.' Holocaust: The entrance to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where 1.3million died during World War II . Nazis: Jones claims to be a former member of the National Socialist party . Jones has already blown his retirement savings on two prior congressional runs – with no success. Jones, an insurance salesman, also . condemned fellow Republicans Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich and Mitt . Romney as ‘war-mongering fools.’ Competition: Arthur Jones hopes to run against Democrat Dan Lipinski (pictured) He said: 'These war-mongering fools in congress like Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney—we can’t let Iran have one nuclear weapon but we let Israel have all the nuclear weapons they want. This is ridiculous.' He claims that he is running again partly because of what he describes as Lipinski’s 'strange affiliation' with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. He describes the body as the 'American Israel Pro Israel Affairs Committee'. The candidate also compares today's conditions in the United States to Germany at the end of World War I. 'Our country is falling apart economically, politically, culturally, militarily,' he said. 'We are going down.' In an online questionnaire, Jones admitted he has been arrested for ‘minor street skirmishes with Leftists.’ The state Republican party has tried to keep the candidate off the ballot because of his anti-semitic views, even though he has gathered enough signatures to qualify.","Illinois candidate Arthur Jones, 64, 'organises Nazi events to celebrate Hitler's birthday'

"Think your morning commute is bad? Spare a thought for your fellow commuters in Istanbul, which has just been crowned king of the traffic jam. Turkey's largest city has the most congested streets in Europe, according to new research. Other major traffic hotspots are Warsaw in Poland, Marseille in France and Palermo and Rome in Italy. Choked: Beneath the beauty of Istanbul lies bumper-to-bumper traffic . Meanwhile, British cities compared favourably to rush hour cities on the continent. The combination of sky high petrol prices and traffic measures like the congestion charge in London has helped cut the number of drivers in many city centres, said satnav firm TomTom in its quarterly Congestion Index. Leeds-Bradford is the most congested conurbation in the UK yet only sits 17th in the top 60 European cities that suffer the most during their peak rush hours. TomTom monitors millions of traffic journeys a year to compare the percentage change between non-peak times and rush hour to compile its hotspot list. Istanbul is the worst for jams as its peak time is 57 per cent more congested than its non-peak times. In April the city suffered its longest . traffic jam in recent memory, lasted for a steering wheel-smashing 72 . hours on the Ataturk Bridge. Top Ten Cities for Congestion (% busier at peak times than during non-peak times):1.Istanbul (Turkey) - 57% 2.Warsaw (Poland) - 45%3.Marseille (France) - 40%4.Palermo (Italy) - 40%5.Rome (Italy) - 34%6.Paris (France) - 34%7.Stuttgart (Germany) - 33%8.Brussels (Belgium) - 32%9.Hamburg (Germany) - 32%10.Stockholm (Sweden) - 30% . ...and the ranking of British cities in the European list:1.Leeds/Bradford - 27%2.London - 26%3.Nottingham - 24%4.Manchester - 22%5.Birmingham - 20%6.Sheffield - 20%7.Newcastle-Sunderland - 20%8.Liverpool - 20%9.Glasgow - 17% . Poland's capital, Warsaw, is in second place with a 45 per cent increase and Marseille is in third with a 40 per cent leap, narrowly ahead of Palermo in Italy. The top ten includes capitals Paris and Rome, both notorious for the constant stream of traffic in the city centres, plus German industrial towns Hamburg and Stuttgart. The top 60 includes nine British cities but only two are in the top 20, Leeds-Bradford and London. Other British cities to feature in the congestion index include Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield along with Newcastle-Sunderland, Nottingham and Glasgow. A spokesman for TomTom said: 'Whilst cold, ice and snow were an important cause of extra congestion in the UK in the first quarter of the year, rainstorms played a major role in April, May and June. 'April to June were some of the wettest months on record.  This has a major influence on road speeds. 'We also saw some major construction projects causing traffic delays, such as the development of New Street rail station in Birmingham and the temporary closure of Liverpool Central station. 'Other recurring causes include insufficient road capacity compared to demand, and ineffective management of that road capacity.'

"The head of Ukraine’s secret service has claimed rebels intended to down a Russian airliner to give Vladimir Putin a pretext for invasion – but blasted Flight MH17 out of the sky by mistake. Valentyn Nalyvaichenko said that Russian-backed fighters were supposed to take their BUK rocket launcher – which had been transported across the Russian border – to a village called Pervomaiskoe in Ukrainian-held territory west of Donetsk. Instead, they mistakenly positioned it in a rebel-controlled village of the same name to the east of the city. Scroll down for video . Got it wrong? Valentyn Nalyvaichenko claims pro-Russian rebels targeted the wrong civilian airliner . If they had gone where they had been ordered, he said, they would have hit an Aeroflot flight carrying civilians travelling from Moscow to Larnaca in Cyprus. Crucially, the crash site would have been in Ukrainian-held territory. The mass killing of Russian tourists could then have been blamed on the Ukrainian army, giving Moscow a justification for invasion, said Mr Nalyvaichenko, head of the Ukrainian intelligence service, the SBU. ‘This cynical terrorist act was intended to justify an immediate military invasion by the Russian Federation,’ he said. Aeroflot flight AFL2074 was close to Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 when it was blown out of the sky on July 17, killing all 298 on board, he said. ‘It is incredibly cynical that the act of terrorism was planned against peaceful innocent Russian citizens who were on the way to their holidays with children,’ added Mr Nalyvaichenko. He claimed this was a significant conclusion of Kiev’s probe into MH17’s downing. Last night there was no independent confirmation of the claim by the SBU, formerly part of the Soviet KGB but now closely co-operating with Western intelligence agencies. There are no fewer than seven villages called Pervomaiskoe in Donetsk region, and the rebels chose the wrong one – close to Torez – to site the mobile BUK system, according to the theory. The SBU say that they have given evidence of their ‘wrong village’ allegations to the Dutch-led team leading the investigation into the crash. Tensions: The offensive in Ukraine continued last night amid claims Russia was preparing a military invasion . 'Immense convoy': Kiev-sent troops paraded down a road near Donetsk allegedly heading off Russian troops . The news came as tensions in Ukraine rose yesterday after claims Russia was preparing to stage a military invasion in the guise of a ‘humanitarian’ mission, which Russia has been repeatedly calling for in the east of the country. An ‘immense convoy’ comprising ‘troops and military hardware’ was thwarted from entering the country early yesterday, according to a senior Ukrainian official, amid fears of a full-scale war breaking out. Britain and the US warned sending Russian troops in a ‘humanitarian’ mission would be ‘unjustified and illegal’. A rebel leader in Donetsk has claimed the city is surrounded by Ukrainian forces and that his troops are willing to accept a ceasefire. But observers warned that it may be a tactical move laying the groundwork for Russian intervention. The SBU separately claimed that President Putin had sent his crack Pskov Airborne Assault Division to the village of Veidelevka in Russia’s Voronezh region, six miles from the border. Other brigades from Siberia have been posted close to the frontier, to join tens of thousands of troops already in the area. ‘The personnel of these compounds are preparing firing positions and equipping field camps,’ said Andriy Lysenko of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council.","Valentyn Nalyvaichenko said pro-Russian rebels hit wrong civilian plane .

"Tory chairman Grant Shapps has been accused of changing entries on his Wikipedia page to make it read more favourably. Among the deletions are references to his school results and a section on political gaffes. The online encyclopedia had reported details of his time at Watford grammar school, saying he had ‘obtained four O-levels including an A in CDT (Craft, Design and Technology)’. References removed: Tory party chairman Grant Shapps, pictured last week, is said to have deleted details about his time at senior school on Wikipedia . In its place, Mr Shapps, 43, inserted a glowing testimony to his ‘influential’ work on homelessness. Mr Shapps, who took over as Tory party . chairman last week, also deleted a Wikipedia passage referring to . donations to his office while he was shadow housing minister. The original entry read that in May . 2008 he had ‘taken large donations from companies related to his . frontbench portfolio’ and that this was ‘potentially damaging for Mr . Shapps given the extent of the donations’. The amounts were said to have run into . ‘tens of thousands of pounds’ and had been from mortgage brokers, an . estate agent and a firm of solicitors. His side: Mr Shapps, 43, justified the edits, saying he removed politically biased or unreferenced edits and claiming 'content must be verifiable' Mr Shapps sent a letter to the . parliamentary commissioner in 2008 admitting a potential conflict of . interest. Sources say the reference to the donations was deleted from . Wikipedia because many of them were set up by his predecessor Michael . Gove. Another passage deleted by Mr Shapps . referred to ‘media attention for a number of gaffes during his time on . the Conservative frontbench’. It is the second brush Mr Shapps has . had with an internet company in the past few days. It was reported over . the weekend that Google had blacklisted a network of websites run by Mr . Shapps’s family for breaching rules on copyright infringement, but this . has been denied by a spokesman. The MP is said to have used a pseudonym – Michael Green – to set up and promote a company that broke Google’s rules. Education: He is said to have deleted details about his time at Watford Grammar School for Boys, where the website claimed he 'obtained four O-levels' The business HowToCorp sells software . which increases a website’s advertising revenue by using content from . other sites. Mr Shapps is no longer named on the firm’s documents. Mr Shapps last night told the Mail he . had not touched the Wikipedia site for years. He said: ‘If it was a . vanity exercise then I certainly wouldn’t have got rid of a Wiki claim . that I received an A in Craft, Design & Technology – sadly for me, I . only achieved a B. ‘Everyone knows I’m not in the least . bit embarrassed about my schooling and I am proud to live in a country . where people can succeed regardless of their background.

"Syrian troops killed dozens of jihadi fighters in heavy clashes  around a sprawling northern air base that the Islamic State group is trying to seize, activists and state media said. Islamic State fighters began a long-anticipated offensive  to seize Tabqa air base in the northern province of Raqqa, the last position held by the Syrian government in a province that is a stronghold of the al-Qaida breakaway group. The assault on the Tabqa air base had been expected for weeks. Islamic State fighters have tightened their siege of the military facility in recent days, capturing a string of nearby villages. Syria's state news agency SANA quoted an unnamed military official as saying that 'large numbers of terrorists were wiped out' near the air base. Islamic State spokesman Abu Mosa, who appeared in the Vice News ISIS documentary, was killed in Raqqa . The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the death toll among Islamic State fighters is at least 11 and possibly as many as 'tens.' Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV said more than 150 members of the Islamic State were killed in an ambush near the air base. Al-Manar, a network run by the Lebanese Hezbollah, which is a close ally of the Syrian government, gave a similar number. The Raqqa Media Center, an activist collective, reported fierce clashes around the facility accompanied by government airstrikes. It said a prominent Islamic State media activist known as Abu Mosa, who appeared in a recent Vice News documentary about the group, was among those killed. It said that another media activist, Abu Abdullah al-Ansari, was also killed. The Observatory, which relies on a network of activists inside Syria, confirmed Abu Mosa and al-Ansari's deaths. A member loyal to the Islamic State waves an IS flag in Raqqa where the group has proclaimed its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghadi as 'Caliph' The Observatory said the Islamic State group launched two suicide attacks on Wednesday but failed to break into the air base. The Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said Islamic State fighters attacking the air base are led by Omar al-Shishani, one of the group's most prominent military figures. The air base is one of the most significant military facilities in the area, containing several warplanes, helicopters, tanks, artillery and ammunition. Last month, Islamic State fighters overran the Division 17 military base in Raqqa, killing at least 85 soldiers. Two weeks later, the extremists seized the nearby Brigade 93 base after days of heavy fighting. Since July, following their blitz across Iraq and after they declared a self-styled caliphate straddling the Iraq-Syria border, Islamic State fighters have methodically picked off isolated government bases in northern and eastern Syria, killing and decapitating army commanders and pro-government militiamen.","Islamic State fighters killed in offensive to seize Tabqa air base .

"Millionaire Hekmat Kaveh, 55, who runs £20,000-a-year The Abbey College in Malvern, Worcestershire, admitted 15 breaches of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 . The owner of one of Britain's top independent schools has been ordered to pay nearly £50,000 for risking pupils' lives by having 'woefully inadequate' fire safety measures. Millionaire Hekmat Kaveh, 55, who runs £20,000-a-year The Abbey College in Malvern, Worcestershire, admitted 15 fire safety breaches when he appeared in court on Wednesday. The Iranian-born property developer, who lives in a £1.4million Georgian mansion in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was fined £24,000 for the offences and ordered to pay £25,000 court costs. Worcester Crown Court heard the school, which has around 200 pupils . aged 14-20, had 'defective smoke alarms and non-functional fire doors in . student sleeping areas'. Judge Michael Cullum told Kaveh his fire risk assessment was 'woefully . inadequate' and said the wealthy businessman had 'both a moral and legal . responsibility' for the staff and children. 'The consequences of a fire would have been disastrous,' he added. Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service brought the prosecution . against Kaveh after inspectors visited the school in 2011. Kaveh told . the court: 'Clearly, I was let down by those people employed and . instructed to review the fire assessment at the start of the year, but . the law is clear in that the employer is the responsible person and for . that reason I had no option but to plead guilty. 'The college now meets all regulatory requirements. 'Obviously the fire assessments were reviewed when I was made aware of this by external contractors.' The school, set in 70 acres of rolling Worcestershire countryside, was founded in 1974 and teaches GCSEs and A-Levels to predominantly rich foreign students. Each class has an average of just seven students. Speaking . after the sentencing, deputy chief officer Richard Lawrence, said lives had been put at risk. The Abbey College in Malvern, Worcestershire, was founded in 1974 and teaches GCSEs and A-Levels to predominantly rich foreign students. Each class has an average of just seven students . He said: 'This was an extremely serious case where those living and sleeping . inside the premises were being put at risk. 'Business owners have a . clear responsibility to ensure that both the public and their employees . are as safe as possible from the risk of fire. 'This verdict sends . out a clear message: in severe cases where responsibilities are ignored, . we will prosecute, as it is never acceptable to put lives at risk.' The . school, which boasts on its website about being in 'one of the safest . and most beautiful areas of central England', is understood to be under . the control of a limited company.

Forensic tests revealed the substance was 38g of opium with a street value of £100 but all charges were dropped. Last August Kaveh was also accused of demolishing the garden of a couple whose property backs onto the boundary of the school. And in June last year he was also fined £1,000 and ordered to pay £5,000 costs for misusing the title of ‘architect’. The .

"Criticism: Former Tory minister Tim Loughton used a Commons debate to criticise Sussex Police . Police warned a former minister he could be prosecuted for harassing a ‘nightmare constituent’. Tory MP Tim Loughton used a debate in Parliament to heavily criticise Sussex Police which spent six months investigating him for alleged racist abuse after describing Kieran Francis as 'unkempt'. He warned that the police actions were a ‘clear breach’ of parliamentary privilege which if unchallenged could see allow any unhappy voter to pursue a grudge against their MP. Mr Loughton, MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, raised concerns about Mr Francis during a debate in the Commons in March. But this led his constituent to step up an ‘onslaught of vile abuse’, mainly against him, including doctoring photographs of his children taken from social media sites and urging him to commit suicide. During the March debate Mr Loughton, who was education minister until last year, said he was ‘sacking Mr Francis as my constituent’. He added that his staff had been told to put the phone down on him. Mr Loughton said he planned to inform Mr Francis of this information in a letter but instead sent a complete Hansard record which included the March 13 debate. But today the MP revealed that sending the copy of Hansard resulted in him receiving a police information notice (Pin) from Sussex Police. The Pin warned that this action had caused ‘alarm and distress’ to the ex-constituent and warned he would be liable to arrest and prosecution if that kind of behaviour continued, according to Mr Loughton. The Tory told the Commons today he believed Sussex Police's actions represented a ‘clear breach’ of parliamentary privilege. Mr Loughton said: ‘If this goes unchecked, any constituent with a grudge against his or her member of Parliament could claim harassment. ‘Any MP exposing any dodgy organisation in Parliament could find themselves being questioned by the police and... being given advice as to how to do our job. ‘Indeed, Abu Hamza may well have a . case against (Home Secretary Theresa May) for being rightly beastly . about him in Parliament and find herself on the receiving end of a . police information notice.’ Mr Loughton's motion for the Pin to be referred to the Committee of Privileges was passed unopposed in the Commons. Moving the motion, Mr Loughton said . he had no communication with his ex-constituent since sending the . Hansard record while he claimed Mr Francis had ‘stepped up an onslaught . of vile abuse’, which included targeting the leader and chairman of Adur . District Council, among others. Mr . Loughton said: ‘Many come under the heading of political abuse which, . however offensive that is, we all know it is part of our job. ‘However, . what is not part of that job is they have included doctored photographs . of my children taken from their social media sites - what a man in his . 40s is doing trawling the social media sites of teenage girls I do not . know. ‘They were eventually . taken down but he then attempted blackmail - to put them up again - . against me unless I comply with his demands. ‘He's posted doctored pictures of the council leader's young children with Nazi insignia. ‘He has posted vile contorted accounts . of my parents' divorce, forged tweets, posted references to my . neighbours, photographs of my home, most recently a direct tweet urging . me to commit suicide, along with assorted lies, made-up stories and pure . fantasy.’ Battle: Kieran Francis has been embroiled in a long-running online battle with Mr Loughton . Mr Loughton said . despite making complaints to the police, Mr Francis had been arrested . once and no charges were brought against him. He . said: ‘The police have failed to secure any charges and he carries on . harassing, bullying, stalking, trolling and abusing me, my family and . colleagues.’ On September 4, Mr Loughton said a Pin notice was served against him. He said: ‘The notice stated the police . had received an allegation of harassment against me by the . aforementioned constituent, making me aware if the kind of behaviour . described were to continue, then I would be liable to arrest and . prosecution. ‘And the . specific single incident behaviour which gave rise to this Pin was the . act of sending a copy of Hansard to my constituent. ‘Apparently . this had caused my ex-constituent alarm and distress. That came as a . surprise to me and various others, particularly given on his blog on . March 14 that ex-constituent had described how he had watched my . adjournment (debate) on television with great amusement. ‘Apparently . Hansard is a cause of alarm and distress. Our deliberations are a . potent weapon of abuse if you work for Sussex Police.’ Warning: Mr Loughton said the episode raised concerns about the ability of MPs to do their job . Mr Loughton said there was no way to appeal against a Pin and it remains on file for at least 12 months. He added that Detective Chief Inspector David Wardley-Wilkins had also offered him instructions about how he should correspond with constituents without risking a Pin. Mr Loughton said: ‘Police telling us how to do our job. The chief constable, who has been copied in to all these events, has been content to waste taxpayers' resources on this nonsense while senior management of his force are brought into disrepute and he has clearly lost the plot when it comes to distinguishing between the victim and the perpetrator.’ In a statement, Sussex Police said the matter is related to an investigation into a series of allegations and counter allegations ‘where all parties have in turn been considered as victims and suspects’. Assistant Chief Constable Robin Merrett said: ‘We have attempted to mediate between all of the parties involved in this incident for some time, but some have declined to engage in this process and our attempts to do so have not been successful. ‘We did not wish to criminalise anyone, but it became apparent that the issue was not going to be resolved among those concerned and that some form of action was necessary in order to prevent it escalating further. ‘After much consideration and independent scrutiny, the decision was taken to bring matters to a conclusion by issuing Pins  to all of the parties involved. However, it appears that Mr Loughton does not consider the matter closed. ‘In his speech Mr Loughton focused in particular on the supply of the Hansard record to suggest that Sussex Police has interfered with the parliamentary process. The person who received the Hansard report believed it to be a continuation of harassment against him and subsequently reported it to us. ‘We would never seek to interfere with parliamentary processes or privilege, but I strongly support actions taken by the force, which have been subject to independent legal scrutiny. We will of course await the views of the Committee of Privileges before commenting further.’","Tim Loughton said Kieran Francis, of Romany Gipsy descent, was unkempt .

"Despite the rusting hull and tired façade, she retains a majesty which hints to untrained observers of her importance to history.

"Guillermo Ochoa must have been distracted. The Robin van Persie corner was wicked, Dirk Kuyt's movement direct; the Mexican goalkeeper span on his goalline to find Stefan de Vrij careering in from nowhere. The Dutch defender latched on to the cross with a sweetly-hit volley four yards out. Goal, surely? No, on the turn Ochoa threw out two big hands and punch away at point-blank range. It was one of the most stunning saves at this World Cup. And this was no fluke.

Wesley Snejider's volley was unstoppable and coach Miguel Herrera could not legislate for the apparent Arjen Robben dive that eventually won Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's side the game. Up until the 88th minute Mexico were through to the quarter-finals, where they would have played Costa Rica. That, in part, was down to the No 1. He made another super save, from Robben when bearing down on goal, and organised his defence with ultimate assurance.

"Named: Teenage hacker Mustafa Al-Bassam can be named for the first time today after an anonymity order was lifted . This is the 18-year-old British hacker who joined in high-tech attacks on the CIA and the Serious Organised Crime Agency. A-Level student Mustafa Al-Bassam, who until now had his identity protected because of his age, previously admitted two computer crime charges relating to notorious hacker collective Lulzsec. During the attacks on February 1, 2011, members of the loosely-organised group hijacked computers to overwhelm the systems of major bodies including Sony and newspaper publisher News International. The so-called 'distributed denial of service' attacks (DdoS) work by overwhelming target servers with useless data and flooding computers with traffic. Al-Bassam also pleaded guilty to a longer-running hacking campaign that saw data stolen from the systems of organisations including 20th Century Fox, Nintendo, the NHS, and the Arizona State Police. Two further charges, in which he was accused alongside others of posting confidential documents on the web for others to see, have been dropped by prosecutors. Al-Bassam, who turned 18 in January, was not present at Southwark Crown Court this morning, where co-accused Ryan Ackroyd, 26, and Jake Davis, 20, were due to stand trial on similar charges. Ackroyd, from Doncaster, who was central to the campaign waged by Lulzsec when it launched the attacks in 2011, changed his plea to a key charge at the last minute. He is the last of four British members of . the shady online outfit, whose victims included the Pentagon, the CIA, . and the UK's Serious and Organised Crime Agency, to be convicted. Prosecutors announced they were satisfied with two charges Davis pleaded guilty to at an earlier hearing. Davis, known by the alias 'Topiary', took part in the cyber assaults from his bedroom in the Shetland Islands, and has been bailed ahead of sentencing. Ryan Cleary, 21, of  Wickford, Essex, previously admitted joining the hack attacks, and is currently awaiting sentencing. Lulzsec: Jake Davis, 20, is pictured left outside Westminster Crown Court 2011, while Ryan Cleary, 21, is seen right outside Southwark Crown Court, also in 2011 . He controlled a 'botnet' of up to half a million compromised computers which he used to launch DDoS attacks against websites. The name Lulzsec is a combination of 'lulz' or 'lols', meaning 'laugh out loud' and security. Notorious: Ryan Ackroyd, 25, seen arriving at Southwark Crown Court today, changed his plea at the last minute today and is now on bail awaiting sentencing . Al-Bassam, of Peckham, southeast London, admits two counts of conspiring to do an unauthorised act with intent, or reckless as to, impairing the operation of computer. He was bailed ahead of sentencing. Other high-profile victims of the online outfit included electronics giant Sony, film studios 20th Century Fox, and the Arizona State Police. Sandip Patel, prosecuting, said the Crown Prosecution Service was prepared to drop a separate hacking charge against Ackroyd on the basis of his guilty plea. He said: 'The defendant now acknowledges, as borne out by the evidence, that he was a member of Lulzsec. 'He was the hacker - they turned to him for his expertise as a hacker. 'In respect of some of the victims he now acknowledges he was 'Kayla', a 16-year-old girl, amongst others.' Kayla is an alias Ackroyd used online to hide his true identity. Ackroyd admitted a charge which accused him of hacking into a series of organisations' computer systems between February 1, 2011, and September 2 the same year. He continues to deny a separate allegation of taking part in so-called 'distributed denial of service attacks', which overwhelm computers with useless data, earlier that year. That charge is to be formally withdrawn by the prosecution at the next hearing. Adjourning proceedings, Judge Deborah Taylor told him: 'I'm adjourning this case for sentencing until May 14. 'I'm granting you bail on the same conditions as before.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Mustafa Al-Bassam named for first time after anonymity order was lifted .

When . he finally revealed he would not support missiles going into Syria . without more conditions, Mr Cameron accused him of ‘letting down .

But . yesterday Mr Miliband insisted he was not turning his back on the . victims of the civil war, including the hundreds of children attacked . with nerve gas by the regime of tyrant Bashar al-Assad. ‘We need the peace talks to get going,’ he said. ‘So there are other things the Government should be doing.’ A . Government source last night accused Mr Miliband of ‘breathtaking . hypocrisy’, adding: ‘It’s beyond parody. He needs to start taking some . responsibility for his own actions.’ Business . minister Matthew Hancock took to Twitter, saying: ‘Didn’t think Ed . Miliband could sink much lower but having given in to his party to . scupper action, now he asks Government not to “wash its hands”.’ The . row came amid mounting speculation that Mr Miliband, who initially . indicated cautious support for intervention, pulled back after being . warned that as many as seven members of his frontbench team could resign . if he backed retaliatory strikes against the Assad regime. Health spokesman Diane Abbott indicated she would consider quitting if Mr Miliband backed the Prime Minister. Ed Miliband (left) said he wasn't turning his back on the people of Syria.

Labour’s Blairites descended into soul-searching about the fact that . the party now appeared to have adopted a clear anti-interventionist . stance. Former Labour Culture . Secretary Ben Bradshaw blamed Mr Cameron for the outcome, but insisted . that Labour must not turn its back on the unfolding crisis in Syria. Mr Bradshaw said MPs had voted against military action ‘by accident’. He . added: ‘Public opinion is fickle. More reports like last night’s on the . BBC of an appalling attack on a Syrian primary school could quickly . change the public mood.’ Peter . Watt, Labour’s former general-secretary said he was ‘slightly ashamed’ of the outcome of Mr Miliband’s manoeuvrings, adding: ‘I just hope that . if the evidence is compelling (not conclusive) that the Americans take . action.’ Yesterday Mr Miliband . said he had not ruled out ever backing military action in Syria, but . added: ‘Given where we are and given what’s happened, I think now . Britain needs to focus on what Britain can do for the people of Syria. ‘The innocent of Syria have been let down by domestic politics and domestic political calculation.’ Mr Miliband said it was right that Britain and the US made their own decisions about how to respond to the situation in Syria. ‘America . has got to take its own judgment about what’s right for America, but . Britain also has to take its own judgment about where its national . interests lie and how we should be acting,’ he said.

'The time we missed apart, we're definitely making up for that now.' But she admits the process has not been easy and her 10-year-old daughter has been teased at school forcing teachers to block her Taylor's name on internet searches at the facility. 'She was being picked on, had students telling her they saw her mom on TV, saying, why is your mom in jail?' Taylor said. 'Students asking her, put your mom's name in the computer, let's see what comes up. It was rough.' On March 20 a witness found the baby crying hysterically and sweating profusely as temperatures inside the SUV topped 100 degrees.

The story made national headlines after Taylor's emotional mug shot emerged, and she revealed that she had acted out of desperation after the babysitter pulled out at the last minute. 'It was me knowing my family was in crisis and knowing that I had to make a choice between providing for my children or caring for my children,' she told Matt Lauer on the Today show earlier this summer. As strangers donated more than $114,000 to pay her legal fees and other expenses, the story sparked a national debate about how much access single mothers or those in dire financial situations have to public assistance. According to court documents, firefighters found the vehicle's windows rolled down an inch and no running air conditioning to keep the children cool (file photo) Her children were taken to hospital on the day of her arrest but were not found to have suffered any injuries. They were placed with family and Taylor was eventually allowed to see them under supervision. Taylor was released from jail on March 31. She was granted custody of her three children at a hearing in a Maricopa County courtroom earlier this month. The court previously agreed to dismiss the abuse charges against her as long as she completes parenting classes. Taylor said she is still looking for a job and hopes to land one in the service industry. 'I am still looking. It's been a little bit difficult.

The Paris catacombs are a 200-mile network of old caves, tunnels and quarries - and much of it is filled with the skulls and bones of the dead. Going underground: An explorer roams through the skull and bone-lined walkways of the Paris catacombs . Death on display: The macabre mosaics lining the walls of the underground network are the remains of 6million former Parisians . Much of the catacombs are . out of bounds to the public, making it illegal to explore unsupervised. But nevertheless, it is a powerful draw for a hardcore group of explorers with a thirst for adventure. A tourist-friendly, legal entrance can be found off Place Denfert-Rochereau . in the 14th arrondissement of Paris, near the Montparnasse district. Here, visitors from all over the . world can descend into the city's dark and dank bowels for a . whistle-stop tour of a small section of the catacombs. One visitor told CNN: . 'I think people are fascinated with death. They don't know what it's . about and you see all these bones stacked up, and the people that have . come before us, and it's fascinating. We're trying to find our past and . it's crazy and gruesome and fun all at the same time.' Eerie: These subterranean quarries had been used to store the remains of generations of Parisians in a bid to tackle overcrowding in cemeteries . Tunnel patrol: Much of the catacombs are off-limits to the public and those caught illegally exploring can be fine up to 60 euros . The well-worn trail might be enough to satisfy the tourists, but other Parisians like to go further - and . deeper - to explore the network. The name given to the group of explorers who go into the cave network illegally and unsupervised is Cataphiles. The top secret groups go deep underground, using hidden entrances all over the city. And they sometimes stay for days at a time, equipped with head lamps and home-made maps. Street names are etched into the walls to help explorers navigate their way around the underground version of the city and some groups have even been known to throw parties in the tunnels or drink wine. For catacomb devotees, the silence experienced deep in tunnels cannot be replicated anywhere else. Still life: Cataphiles seeking out peace and quiet say there is a unique kind of silence to be found in the tunnels . The network has become a draw for Parisians who want to explore the unchartered territory, who are known as Cataphiles . Urban explorer Loic Antoine-Gambeaud told CNN: 'I think it's in the collective . imagination. Everybody knows that there is something below Paris; that . something goes on that's mysterious. But I don't think many people have . even an idea of what the underground is like.' Those caught exploring unauthorised . sections of the network could end up out of pocket. Police tasked with . patrolling the tunnels have the power to hand out fines of 60 euros to . anyone caught illegally roaming the network. A by-product of the early development . of Paris, the catacombs were subterranean quarries which were . established as limestone was extracted deep underground to build the . city above. However, a number of streets . collapsed as the quarries weakened parts of the city's foundations. Repairs and reinforcements were made and the network went through . several transformations throughout history. However it wasn't until the 18th . century that the catacombs became known as the Empire of the Dead when . they became the solution to overcrowding in the city's cemeteries. Empire of the dead: While much of the 200-mile network is out of bounds, a small section is open to tourists . Hidden network of adventure: The tunnels and quarries are still monitored for safety . The number of dead bodies buried in . Paris's cemeteries and beneath its churches was so great that they began . breaking through the walls of people's cellars and causing serious . health concerns. So the human remains were transferred . to the underground quarries in the early 1780s. There are now more than . 6million people underground. The space was the perfect solution to ease overcrowding in cemeteries but it presented disadvantages elsewhere. It is the reason there are few tall buildings in Paris; large foundations cannot be built because the catacombs are directly under the city's streets. The tunnels also played their part in the Second World War. Parisian members of the French Resistance used the winding tunnels . And German soldiers also set up an underground bunker in the catacombs, just below the 6th arrondissement. World’s Untold Stories: Empire of the Dead’ airs on CNN International, Saturday 11 August at 1400 and 2130 BST .","More than 6million of Paris's dead are buried under the City of Lights .
Much of it is out of bounds, but for some Parisians, the lure of the catacombs is one they cannot resist ."

"Body odor is among 52 criteria that officials at San Diego International Airport use to judge taxi drivers. Cabbies say that smacks of prejudice and discrimination. For years, inspectors with the San Diego Regional Airport Authority run down their checklist for each cabbie — proof of insurance, functioning windshield wipers, adequate tire treads, good brakes. Drivers are graded pass, fail or needs fixing. Anyone who flunks the smell test is told to change before picking up another customer. Discrimination? San Diego airport inspectors are judging how taxi drivers smell, a practice that some drivers say may lead to discrimination against immigrants . Leaders of the United Taxi Workers of San Diego union say the litmus perpetuates a stereotype that predominantly foreign-born taxi drivers smell bad. A 2013 survey of 331 drivers by San Diego State University and Center on Policy Initiatives found 94 percent were immigrants and 65 percent were from East Africa. Drivers wonder how inspectors determine who reeks. Driver Abel Seifu, 36, from Ethiopia, suspects they sniff inconspicuously during friendly conversations in the staging area. Airport authority spokeswoman Rebecca Bloomfield said there is 'no standard process' to testing. Others drivers question how inspectors distinguish between them and their cars. The checklist has a separate item for a vehicle's 'foul interior odors,' which Bloomfield says may include gasoline, vomit or mildew. 'If they want to bring their smell detector, they can use it to test the customers and the drivers,' said driver Negus Gebrenarian, 39, from Ethiopia. He, like other drivers, said the stench is just as likely to come from the back seat as it is from the front. The airport authority says it is enforcing a policy of the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System, which regulates taxis throughout the region, that prohibits foul-smelling drivers and promotes regular bathing. It also says the practice is about satisfying customers. 'Taxi drivers are often the first impression that travelers iujjreceive when arriving into San Diego and we want to encourage a positive experience,' Bloomfield said. Only about three drivers fail to get a passing grade each year, she said. Inspectors have been smelling drivers for years. There was no controversy until a union employee waded through a 568-page airport board agenda and noticed the checklist, which had been approved in July for revisions unrelated to the body odor test. KPBS reported on the practice last week. Outrage: Leaders of the United Taxi Workers of San Diego union say the litmus perpetuates a stereotype that predominantly foreign-born taxi drivers smell bad . Prejudice? Cabbies have complained about the body odor smell test for at San Diego International Airport. A recent survey found that 94 percent of cabbies were immigrants and 65 percent were from East Africa . San Diego's policy appears to be unusually explicit about sniffing out smelly cabbies. Chicago requires that drivers be 'clean and neat in their appearance.' New York City's wording is similarly broad. Seattle long evaluated cabbies for body odor associated with infrequent bathing and not washing clothes but dropped that test last month for a more general requirement on cleanliness. 'The industry didn't like it and they felt that we were kind of overstepping: Why are we dictating to them? We don't tell city employees that you've got to shower more often,' said Denise Movius, Seattle's deputy director of finance and administrative services. Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the 18,000-member New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said her face reddened with anger and dismay when she learned about the San Diego practice. She suggested the airport leave it to customers to complain about body odor. 'What a dehumanizing way to treat your workers,' she said. Travelers arriving in San Diego on Wednesday were mixed. Sue Beneventi, 70, thinks cabbies are getting picked on. 'If you're going to say cab drivers, shouldn't you also say waitresses and anyone else who deals with the public?' she said after returning from San Antonio. Daniel Johnson, an 18-year-old Marine who came from Flint, Michigan, said it's fair to grade on body odor, especially considering the $70 fare to get to his base. He has felt trapped in smelly cabs in other cities. 'The smell puts a sour expression on your face and you're thinking I just don't want to be in here,' he said.","Body odor is among 52 criteria that officials at San Diego International Airport use to judge taxi drivers .

The homecoming parade was the third for 40 Commando following events in 2008 and 2010 when thousands lined the streets of Taunton to pay tribute . The Royal Marines of 40 Commando homecoming parade marks the last major element of more than 14,000 Royal Marines who have withdrawn from Afghanistan after 10 years of deployment . The British Army created its first commando unit in 1940 and from 1942 on, it joined with the Royal Marines. It was during the 1939-45 war, that the Royal Marines took on a commando role, linking the regiment to the Army Commandos that already existed. Winston Churchill had ordered the creation of a 'butcher and bolt' small group raiding unit after the defeat at Dunkirk and the evacuation of the BEF from mainland Europe. The commandos task was to land in Nazi-occupied Western Europe usually at night, destroy vital targets and leave as quickly as possible. In June 1940, Churchill had called for 20,000 men; men he called 'leopards' ready to spring at the throats of the Germans.'There ought to be at least 20,000 Storm Troops or 'Leopards' drawn from existing units, ready to spring at the throats of any small landings or descents.' That month a department in the War Office was created to deal with the issues surrounding the creation of such a force. This office was to become Combined Operations as it involved all three services . Recruits were drawn from the British Army. Churchill himself ordered that thye should be equipped with the best equipment. In 1942, men from the Royal Marines joined (40 Commando was formed in February 1942) and recruits were also drawn from the British Police Force. Selection for the new commando force was necessarily demanding. Men had to be physically very fit. But they also had to show that they did not need the traditional chain of command to operate in the field as in the heat of battle such chains of command could break down. Initiative was considered to be a vital commodity. Some 400 men passed through the first phase of recruitment - which included training when live ammunition was being used. The first official commando raid was in June 1940 on the northern French coast.  Commandos were also in action in other parts of France, Norway, the Middle East and Italy. They played also significant part in D-Day. 'We are also here because Taunton really supports 40 Commando. 'We have been through a range of emotions but it is fabulous to be here today. It is such a relief to have Sam back, words can’t describe it. 'We knew he was going out there, it is what he joined to do and we supported him.' The homecoming marks the last major element of more than 14,000 Royal Marines who have withdrawn from Afghanistan after 10 years of deployment. It was the third for 40 Commando following events in 2008 and 2010 when thousands lined the streets of Taunton to pay tribute. David and Jo Daykin, from Nottingham, took grandsons Harry, five, and Isaac, seven, to watch the Marines. Mr Daykin, who is retired, said: 'We are here to support the troops. We have just got to support them, it is so important. 'It is brilliant to watch them today, it is better than we could have imagined. 'We know one or two of the lads here today as well, so it was another reason to come.' 40 Commando have served in Afghanistan three times, though some members of the unit went out to the country in 2001. Their final tour was completed in April this year, making today their third homecoming. Many members of Somerset County Council attended the parade in Taunton, with staff handing out flags for well-wishers to wave. The authority said it was using the parade as a reminder of the Armed Forces Community Covenant. The Covenant, which is led by the council, is a partnership of local armed forces, local authorities and the voluntary sector and promotes opportunities to link military and civilian societies. Groups across the county can apply for grants from a £35 million national Ministry of Defence fund for projects. The Covenant was established in February 2012. One successful bid has been for 4-40, a family support group for local Royal Marines and a £58,000 play area for children at Bishop Henderson School in Taunton. Interim Leader of the council John Osman, said: 'I'm delighted that Somerset turned out in force to welcome home the Royal Marines of 40 Commando and thanked them for their sacrifice and bravery. 'It's important that our Armed Forces, which are so well represented in Somerset, receive our year-round support and the Covenant is one way in which we can help encourage that. 'I'm sure there must be many more ideas for projects that the Partnership would really like to hear about - and I hope we will see many more applications later this year.'

"Nigel Farage said he blamed a 1988 advert on the high number of youngsters attending university. He added that Britain should look at legalising drugs including heroin . Millions will remember Maureen Lipman’s TV character Beattie praising her grandson when he ‘got an ’ology’. But the TV advert from 1988 has been blamed by Ukip leader Nigel Farage for encouraging a generation to study for what he considers to be worthless degrees. The BT commercial shows Miss Lipman being told her grandson has failed almost every subject in his GCSEs – but passed sociology. Clearly relieved, she tells him: ‘You got an ’ology, you’re a scientist.’ The Ukip leader said: ‘We have got a lot of people getting ’ologies, and I think the way we have demeaned the idea of people learning skills and trades, is just stupid. I blame Maureen Lipman for the whole thing. ‘I think we are sending too many youngsters to university. We are encouraging people to go and get degrees, in many cases not particularly good degrees.’ The comments were made just after Mr Farage said that he believes the war on drugs has been lost and Britain should look at legalising them - including heroin. The UK Independence Party leader made the highly controversial claim that Portugal, where drugs were decriminalised 12 years ago, may have a ‘more enlightened’ approach. He said in a television phone-in that he ‘hates drugs’, has never taken them, and has experience of the damage they can do to young people’s lives. But he believes the current laws criminalising users are ineffective, and would back a Royal Commission to look at alternatives including that in Portugal and some American states. ‘I personally think that the war on drugs was lost many, many years ago and that the lives of millions of people in Britain are being made miserable by the huge criminal element that surrounds the illicit drugs trade and I do think that Portugal does show us that perhaps there is a better, more enlightened way to deal with this’, he said. ‘I’m not pro-drugs by the way, as someone with teenage children, and I’ve seen fairly close to hand the damage that drugs can do to young people. Of the television advert, pictured, Farage said: 'We have got a lot of people getting 'ologies, and I think the way we have demeaned the idea of people learning skills and trades, is just stupid. I blame Maureen Lipman for the whole thing' ‘So I hate drugs, I’ve never taken them myself, I hope I never do, but I just have a feeling that the criminalisation of all these drugs is actually not really helping British society,' he told a Telegraph phone-in. ‘I think we should look at it and if ever there was a subject where we needed a genuine Royal Commission – not to kick it in the long grass – but a genuine Royal Commission to examine Portugal, to examine perhaps what has happened in one or two states in America and in Switzerland, this subject would be it.’ Mr Farage admitted these were his personal views, and not Ukip policy, saying: ‘This is one subject where I differ strongly from my party’. In Portugal , drug users are allowed a 10 day supply, which the law states can include a gram of heroin . He was asked by a viewer about . Portugal, where police and courts no longer pursue people for buying or . possessing small amounts of drugs. They . are allowed a 10 day supply, which the law states is a gram of heroin, . two grams of cocaine, 5g of cannabis and up to a gram of ecstasy or . amphetamine. Anyone with these drugs in higher quantities  is treated as a dealer and charged in court. Those caught with drugs within these limits must report to a ‘warning commission on addition’ which can send them to rehab if they are deemed to have a problem. Experts are divided on how well this has worked, with no big increase in drug use as some had predicted, but no substantial drop either, and in some years deaths from drugs been high. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured today in Devon, has rejected calls from MPs to consider decriminalisation . Dr Manuel Pinto Coelho, President of the Association for a Drug Free Portugal, declared last year that decriminalisation, which treats drug taking as an illness rather than a crime, had ‘not worked’. Mr Farage expressed his support, earlier this year, for Nick Clegg who said following a visit to Columbia that Britain needed to look at alternatives to prohibition. The Ukip leader said in February: ‘The fact is our current approach to drugs is neither practical nor effective. I strongly believe in promoting individual freedom – but I also strongly believe in reducing the public harm caused by drugs. ‘As a parent as much as a politician, I say we have to accept that current policy has not achieved the reductions in crime or consumption that we'd hoped for.’ David Cameron and Theresa May shot down calls from the Home Affairs Select Committee for a royal commission on drugs in 2012. Mr Cameron said at the time: ‘I don't support decriminalisation. We have a policy which actually is working in Britain. Drugs use is coming down, the emphasis on treatment is absolutely right, and we need to continue with that to make sure we can really make a difference. Also, we need to do more to keep drugs out of our prisons. ‘These are the government's priorities and I think we should continue with that rather than have some very, very long-term royal commission.’","BT advert features Maureen Lipman praising grandson on his 'ology'

"Unification fights are nothing new in boxing but the divisions Carl Frampton will be fighting to close this Saturday night are more important than titles and belts. The Jackal is not only bidding to become a world champion but to help heal the sectarian rifts which still haunt he city of Belfast. Frampton takes on Kiko Martinez for the IBF super-bantamweight title, while challenging the old prejudices which brought decades of strife to Northern Ireland. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Carl Frampton square up to Kiko Martinez in heated weigh-in . Fight: Kiko Martinez will take on Carl Frampton for the IBF super-bantamweight world title . He does so as a Protestant boy who married a Catholic girl. It is a Titanic task so it is fitting that it will be undertaken on the site from which that great, if doomed, vessel was launched. A temporary arena has been erected in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast and it is a tribute to the power for good of which the hardest old game is capable that it will be packed with 16,000 Ulstermen and women of both religious persuasions. Thus Frampton follows in the courageous footsteps of his mentor. The great Barry McGuigan, now Frampton’s manager and promoter, defied the worst of The Troubles in reverse wedlock to his protegee, as a Catholic married to a Protestant. The Clones Cyclone also campaigned for peace while bringing a world championship to Ireland, in his case by defeating the renowned featherweight maestro Eusebio Pedroza in London in 1985. Weigh-in: The fight will take place in the Titanic Quarter of Frampton's hometown, Belfast . Head-to-head: Carl Frampton squares up to Martinez during the weigh-in in Belfast . Spaniard: Martinez, from Alicante, was unfazed by Frampton's theatrics . Promoter: Barry McGuigan recognises something of himself in Frampton . McGuigan, who has been married to Sandra for 33 years now, says of young Carl and Christine: ‘He’s a great boxer and a bright kid from a hard loyalist district, she’s a lovely girl with a degree in criminology from a tough Republican area. ‘They offer hope for a new kind of Belfast.’ As did McGuigan himself two decades ago. Frampton talks just as eloquently about being brought up at a virtual battle-front, in streets where the walls were pock-marked with bullet holes. As both his ring-wise inspiration and his living example, McGuigan has steered Frampton to the brink of glory in only his 18th fight while offering living proof that the bitterest of enmities can be overcome. Manager: Carl Frampton's manager ad promoter is Barry McGuigan, who can empathise with Frampton's past . The combine into a formidable force, one which Martinez for all his qualities is unlikely to be able to resist. Frampton has already stopped the Spaniard once, in the ninth round early last year, and should be able to repeat that achievement, especially given home advantage again. Martinez regrouped, admirably, to claim this IBF title but Frampton has been getting stronger and better with every fight. The Jackal’s family – both parents, his pregnant wife and their three-year-old daughter Carla – will be in close attendance. Opponent: Kiko Martinez's record is fought 35, won 31 (23 by knockout) and lost four . They are likely to see him triumph more quickly if he goes to work on the Martinez body from the start. It was when he stepped up that mode of attack that this opponent began to unravel first time out. If so, a golden future will open for Frampton in the shape of more traditional title unification fights against Scott Quigg, Leo Santa Cruz and current champion emeritus Guillermo Rigondeaux. Of itself, this will be the biggest fight in Belfast since McGuigan used to fill the old King’s Hall by uniting rival communities in the name of sport. The open night air will be electric with anticipation. Expect exciting victory, inside and outside the ring. Frampton v Martinez will be televised live on BoxNation this Saturday from 7 pm.

"Famed artist, scientist, and engineer Leonardo di Vinci created a beeswax sculpture of a man riding a horse in 1508, thought to be a model for a larger commission. But the Italian Renaissance master died before the model could be cast in metal, and mysteriously vanished from public sight for centuries. But after painstaking search, the casting was recovered, and a bronze sculpture of the horse and rider was finally unveiled. Mastery: The first bronze casting of Leonardo da Vinci's original Horse and Rider wax sculpture was unveiled in Los Angeles; it took three years to produce . The original beeswax sculpture, as well as the carefully constructed cast, were put on display in Las Vegas in an exhibition called ‘Da Vinci – the Genius’ after their unveiling at the Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills, California. The tale of how the cast was preserved, re-discovered, and re-created is one of deep fascination. In 1508, the great artist created the 12-inch high, 12-inch long beeswax sculpture of a Renaissance military man mounted on a bucking horse, intended for Da Vinci’s friend Charles d’Amboise. However, Da Vinci died in 1519 without completing his work, and the cast was passed onto his apprentice, Francesco Mezi. According to Yahoo News, the sculpture was kept safe in the Mezi family until the 1930s, when World War II came to Italy. The family then moved it to Switzerland for safekeeping. Little was known about the sculpture’s whereabouts until the 1980s, when a group of roving businessmen made it their mission to track it down. Casting call: The new mould was taken from Leonardo's beeswax sculpture . Businessman Richard A. Lewis purchased the statue in 1985, but was unsure of his purchase until he spoke with Dr Carlo Pedretti, an expert on the artist and professor emeritus of art history at The University of California – Los Angeles. Renaissance man: This sculpture is the only surviving work of the legendary Italian artist . After meticulously studying the relic, Dr Pedretti confirmed that it was indeed authentic. Twenty-five years later, Mr Lewis hired the American Fine Arts Foundry to create a bronze sculpture, a process that took three years. In addition to the first replica, Art Encounter will make a limited amount of additional facsimiles to sell to art collectors. Mr Lewis said that $1million of the proceeds will be donated to the Salvation Army’s substance abuse program. According to the Las Vegas Sun, the replicas will be sold at $25,000 to $35,000. He told Yahoo News at the unveiling: ‘It’s a magnificent piece of art and I’d like to have as many people as possible be able to appreciate it.’ The statue will make its rounds to London and New York after the Las Vegas exhibit closes. Born in 1452, Da Vinci was the bastard son of a peasant and a land owner, and began apprenticing for an artist at the age of 14. By age 20, he began his own workshop, having learned under Verrocchio the skills of leather working, metal arts, sculpting, drawing, and carpentry. By 1482, Da Vinci was quickly gaining fame for his work, completing his fresco painting The Last Supper during this time. He was privately commissioned to paint what is arguably his most famous work, the Mona Lisa. The painting of the mysteriously smiling woman was completed around 1507. The artist also had some 13,000 pages worth of scientific and anatomical sketches. He died in 1519. The statue is considered to be the only surviving example of his sculptural work, and shows that the Renaissance man truly deserves the title of master artist.","Master created beeswax mould for sculpture, possibly intended as a design for larger statue .

"The five children who were allegedly slain by their father were remembered at a memorial in Mississippi on Friday, while 500 miles away, their father's lawyers told a court he was 'not a monster'. Timothy Ray Jones Jr., 32, is accused of killing his three boys and two girls, wrapping their bodies in separate trash bags and driving around for days with their decomposing bodies before dumping them on a rural hilltop in Alabama earlier this month. Their bodies were found on Tuesday. At the memorial for his slain children today at the Amory Church of Christ in Mississippi, a poem was read for each sibling. There were balloons released in their honor and a slide show. The program given out had a smiling photo of each child and described what they loved to do. The program says the youngest girl, Elaine, 'loved giving high fives and kisses'. The oldest, Merah Gracie, eight, enjoyed reading books and coloring. Two of the boys - seven-year-old Elias and six-year-old Nahtahn, loved to fish. Their brother, Gabriel, enjoyed watching Care Bears and 'VeggieTales.' At the end of the description for the four oldest children, it said they 'loved wrestling with dad'. Scroll down for video .

Authorities released photos of each child's smiling face earlier this week. The emotional sheriff said at the time he wouldn't release the names until autopsies were done. The children were named as Merah, eight; Elias, seven; Nahtahn, six; Gabriel, two, and one-year-old Elaine Marie, in court records from their parents' divorce. Jones killed his five children at home, 'by violent means,' about a week before his ex-wife reported them missing, Acting Lexington County Sheriff Lewis McCarty said in news release issued late on Thursday. Lexington County Coroner Earl Wells conducted autopsies and ruled each of the deaths a homicide. The cause of the children's deaths is still being investigated, Wells said in a statement.

Timothy Jones, Sr., left, hugs his son Travis Jones who clutches a balloon to release in honor of his nieces and nephews . Jones has been charged with five counts of murder. Lawyers said today Jones has been treated for mental health issues in the past as he has waived his first court appearance in South Carolina. His attorney Aimee Zmroczek would not elaborate on what kind of problems Jones  has suffered from. She said his legal team wants to get him an evaluation as soon as possible. During the minute-long hearing, the lawyer said he did not appear in court because he did not want to create further spectacle. She said Jones is being portrayed as a monster but that he is just a man trying to deal with the situation and that he is 'scared'. The sheriff has moved Jones to the state prison after fears for his safety in the county jail. He had been held overnight on suicide watch, police said. Timothy Ray Jones Jr., is escorted by lawmen out of the Smith County Jail to a vehicle for transport to Lexington County, South Carolina on Thursday . On Thursday, in South Carolina, social services officials said they visited Jones' homes a dozen times in the last three years. The children seemed happy and well-adjusted despite occasional spankings, and the family took a summer trip to Disney World and the beach, according to documents released by the Department of Social Services. Authorities never found anything serious enough to take the children away, but the documents revealed Jones, as a single father and computer engineer, struggling to raise his children. In the social worker's last visit - two weeks before the children's disappearance - a social worker summed up Jones' life: 'Dad appears to be overwhelmed as he is unable to maintain the home, but the children appear to be clean, groomed and appropriately dressed,' wrote the case worker, whose name was blacked out, on an August 13 report. On August 28, Jones picked up his children from school and day care. McCarty said the children were likely killed soon after that, with Jones loading their bodies in trash bags in his Cadillac Escalade. An intoxicated and agitated Jones was arrested at a DUI checkpoint in Smith County, Mississippi, on Saturday, and authorities said he had a form of synthetic marijuana on him. Officers found children's clothes, blood and maggots in his SUV. A view of the home of Timothy Ray Jones is shown, in Redbank, South Carolina on Wednesday. Authorities expect to charge Jones in connection with the deaths of his five children after he led officers to a secluded clearing in Alabama where their bodies lay wrapped in individual garbage bags . Three days later, he led police to the bodies on a remote hillside in Alabama. Authorities said they still don't know his motive, how the children were killed and why they were buried there. Jones was returned to South Carolina on Thursday to face murder charges. In October 2011, Jones confronted a case worker who demanded he clean up the clothes and blankets scattered on the floor, boxes of food on top of the counter with tools scattered around them where the children could be hurt and an open air vent, where a kid could step and break a leg. The argument got so heated the case worker called deputies, and Jones calmed down when they arrived.

Three days later, the case worker returned and wrote: 'observed the home to be VERY VERY VERY CLEAN.' Case workers made follow up visits over the next several months as Jones' marriage fell apart amid allegations his wife cheated on him with a neighbor. Jones' wife talked about being lonely and what a mistake the couple thought they made moving from Mississippi, where Jones' family lived. They moved after he got a degree at Mississippi State University and was hired making $71,000-a-year job as a computer engineer at Intel. More than a decade ago, when Jones was 19, he was convicted of cocaine possession and a crime spree in the suburbs of Chicago, where he grew up, that consisted of car theft, burglary and passing forged checks on his father's account. 'Typical teenager doing stupid stuff, that's about it,' Jones' father, Tim Jones Sr, said from his home in Amory, Mississippi.

"GOLDENEYE: IAN FLEMING'S JAMAICA by Matthew Parkinson (Hutchinson £20) At the height of summer July 1943, Ian Fleming, then the assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence, flew to Jamaica with his old friend Ivar Bryce to investigate reports that a millionaire Swede — and Nazi sympathiser — had built a secret submarine base on the island. Bryce came away convinced that the trip had been a disaster. They found no evidence of a base and it rained incessantly — so much so that toadstools grew in their shoes overnight. Unbeknown to him, Fleming felt quite differently. He didn’t care about the rain or the toadstools in his shoes. He loved everything about Jamaica, especially its air of romantic decay. Jamaican idyll: Ursula Andress and Sean Connery in Bond film Dr No, filmed near Fleming’s island home . As soon as the war was over, he asked Bryce — who knew the island well — to look for a plot of land where he could build a house. Bryce found a 14-acre strip of coastline with a thin sliver of silver sand below. It was on sale for £2,000. When he visited the site with the land agent, Bryce thought it had everything Fleming wanted. Gazing out to sea, he saw a beautiful local girl swimming. When she got out of the water, she was naked. That was the clincher. ‘He will adore this place,’ Bryce told the agent. ‘Tie it up tomorrow, Reggie.’ Bryce was right. Fleming was entranced. From the start, he had a very clear idea about what sort of house he wanted. Exotic inspiration: Ian Fleming at his typewriter in his Jamaican home Goldeneye, were James Bond began . The most important thing was that it should be simple. There was to be no glass in the windows ‘so that the birds could fly through’, no cupboards, only coat hooks, and the bedrooms should be ‘insignificant and small’. The finished house looked, according to Fleming’s friend Noel Coward, exactly like a medical centre, but Fleming didn’t care. Coward didn’t think much of the cooking either, claiming that the food ‘tasted of armpits’, but nothing could dent Fleming’s enthusiasm. Shortly after moving into Goldeneye, he began work on what was to become the first James Bond novel, Casino Royale. The mixture of action and sensuality that Fleming found at Goldeneye — as he christened his new home — proved to be the rock upon which James Bond was built. But it wasn’t just that — Bond owed his very existence to the place. Fleming took his name from the ornithologist author of The Field Guide To Birds Of The West Indies. Fleming was a passionate ornithologist, and as Matthew Parker observes, anyone who kills a bird in a Bond story unleashes his fiercest wrath and always ends up dead. the rock on which Bond was built: Shortly after moving into Goldeneye, Fleming began work on what was to become the first James Bond novel, Casino Royale . Golden home: Tense, aloof and pretty unlikable in London, Fleming became far more easygoing as soon as he set foot in Jamaica (Goldeneye pictured) Friends who visited Fleming noticed that he seemed quite different when he was at Goldeneye. Tense, aloof and pretty unlikable in London, he became far more easygoing as soon as he set foot in Jamaica. In a sense he left his other life behind, at least temporarily, although it wasn’t long before trouble — women trouble in particular — followed him across the Atlantic. For several years he had been having an affair with Ann Harmsworth, the wife of Viscount Rothermere, proprietor of the Mail. Rothermere, not altogether surprisingly, had become increasingly fed-up with his wife’s behaviour. Mixed blessing: Ann Harmsworth, Fleming's mistress and then wife, pictured with her first husband Viscount Rothmere . When she became pregnant — by Fleming — he decided he’d finally had enough and filed for divorce. For an incorrigible philanderer like Fleming, this was a distinctly mixed blessing. He felt he had no alternative but to ask Ann to marry him, but did so in a spirit of deep foreboding. She plainly had her doubts, too. Writing to Fleming from America while he was at Goldeneye, she begged him to try to stay faithful to her for three weeks just as an experiment. ‘You have never done it before and it might make you feel very happy.’ Like Bond, there was something distinctly misogynistic about Fleming’s philandering. The novelist, Rosamond Lehmann, once observed that he ‘got off with women because he could not get on with them’. All this hardly boded well for their future together. On the day that Ann’s decree absolute came through, they were married in the local town hall, then went to Goldeneye for a wedding supper. Again Noel Coward, one of the two witnesses, was appalled by the food — ‘the black crab tasted just like cigarette ash’. But the cooking proved to be the least of their problems. Ann, it soon became clear, regarded James Bond as a bit of an embarrassment. She referred to Fleming’s books as ‘horror comics’ and ‘pornography’. And then there was parenthood. When Ann gave birth to a son, Casper, the couple quickly grew bored of him — a nanny would bring him to see them before dinner, then a few minutes later take him away again. Fleming’s drinking, always pretty heavy, became heavier still. His health began to suffer — doctors repeatedly told him to cut down on the booze and the cigarettes, but to no avail. Then, just as Fleming was feeling his age, Bond took off. The books got a huge boost in 1961 when President Kennedy — no slouch in the bedroom himself — named From Russia With Love as one of his favourite novels. Mix of action and sensuality: Ursula Andress and Sean Connery on the set of Dr No in Jamaica . Not long before, Kennedy and Fleming had met. Over dinner, Kennedy asked him what James Bond would do about Fidel Castro, who had just seized power in Cuba. Fleming, jokingly, said that Bond would slip something into his drink to make his beard fall out. Amazingly, the CIA took up his suggestion and worked on a plan to dust Castro’s shoes with thallium, a strong depilatory. Three years later, Fleming was dead of a massive heart attack, at just 56. Subsequently, Goldeneye was bought by the record producer, Chris Blackwell, the son of a friend of Fleming’s, who did the place up and turned it into a swanky holiday let — Sting wrote Every Breath You Take there. You might think there is nothing new to say about Ian Fleming — that every detail of his life has been obsessively picked over by biographers. Matthew Parker, though, has produced a book as illuminating as it is intriguing. Written in a quick-fire, atmospheric, prose style that clearly owes something to Fleming’s own, it cracks along with all the urgency of a Bond novel. An odd love story: Ian Fleming's relationship with his Jamaican home Goldeneye might  be the most fulfilling affair he ever had . As Parker shrewdly points out, in an odd sort of way this is a love story — albeit one between a man and a house. Yet it might just be the most fulfilling affair that Fleming ever had. Parker’s just as insightful on our own love affair with Bond and what it tells us about ourselves. The books — and films — tap into our sense of national pride, as well as our tendency towards self-deprecation. We know that Bond’s patriotism is absurd, and that he himself is absurd, but every time he bumps off another baddy or beds another woman, we can’t help raising an imaginary glass and murmuring: ‘Good on you, chum.’","When Ian Fleming first visited Jamaica in 1943 he was entranced .

"An ex-convict who served 11 years in prison for the brutal death of an off-duty police officer has been fired as a Chicago little league baseball coach after the dead man's family raised concerns over his suitability to mentor children. Officer John Matthews was murdered in Hegewisch in 1988 by a group of five young men – including Dean Chavez - who beat him to death with baseball bats. Matthews’ wife, 23, was left to raise three children under the age of six on her own. Dean Chavez, left, was sacked earlier this summer but only after the family of John Matthews, right, a Chicago cop brutally murdered in 1988, complained to the national president of the Babe Ruth League . Mathews' son Joey, now 30, told ABC7 that he was incredulous when he found out that one of the men found guilty of murdering his father was coaching kids in the same neighborhood. ‘The fact is, a man who killed another man using a baseball bat is coaching kids to swing a baseball bat. It boggles the mind,’ said Matthews. Convicted of second degree murder, Chavez was sentenced to 27 years and served 11. In recent years he has coached youth baseball in the Hegewisch Babe Ruth Baseball program, including a first place finish earlier this summer. When Joey Mathews approached the league over their failure to carry out a proper background check on Chavez, he claims they tried to sweep the matter under the carpet. Both he and his mother sent emails to . Hegewisch baseball officials asking for Chavez to be removed, but were . told that he was a good coach who didn't compromise the safety of the . children. Joey Mathews, left, claims that when he approached the league over their failure to carry out a proper background check on Chavez, right, they tried to sweep the matter under the carpet . It was only after Mathews approached the national president of the Babe Ruth League, that Chavez was fired. Now the Mathews family are also seeking the dismissal of the league's five board members, and for the local and national Babe Ruth bylaws to be changed so that this doesn't happen again. The bylaws currently only cover potential coaches convicted of a sexual offense or an offense against a minor, according to Mathews. ‘Unfortunately, he (Chavez) forfeited . his . right to be a role model and a mentor when he took my father’s life,’ said Joey's sister Anne, who was six when her father was murdered. Chavez told ABC7 that he had been trying to make amends and help his community, but said he now has no plans to continue coaching or volunteering. The league are hosting a meeting on Wednesday evening in Hegewisch to address the matter which Mathews said has opened up old wounds for his mom. 'No one should have to live through this twice,' he said.","Dean Chavez was convicted of second degree murder and served 11 for his part in the brutal murder of Chicago cop John Matthews .

"A 12-year-old girl stabbed 19 times in a murder plot allegedly hatched by two classmates to win favor with a fictional character called Slender Man, has been sent a prestigious Purple Heart medal by an anonymous well-wisher, the victim's family said on Tuesday. The Purple Heart was recently sent to the 12-year-old girl in an unsigned card that read: 'The Only Heart I Could Find – Be Strong,' the Wisconsin family said in a statement.

'It does not surprise me that a decorated veteran unselfishly gave this amazingly brave and courageous little girl something from his or her heart,' Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary John Scocos said in a statement. The Slender Man is a prevalent internet myth that has been a viral sensation since it emerged online in 2009 . The girl, who has not been identified, was lured into a park and stabbed 19 times in late May in Waukesha, a western suburb of Milwaukee, by two classmates after a sleepover the night before, according to authorities.

"He has been thrust into the public spotlight since taking on the role as head of the Catholic Church. Yet the early years of Pope Francis I remain somewhat of an unknown with most of the focus rightly centred on his life in the church. Jorge Mario Bergoglio was born . on 17 December 1936 in Buenos Aires into a middle-class family of seven in 1936, his father a railway worker and his mother a housewife. Happy youth? Portrait shots are often forced, but a young Jorge Mario Bergoglio looks relaxed and cheery here, and right, he now Pope Francis (left) in his young years with his brother Oscar Bergoglio . Little is know about his life as a child and latterly as a teenager, but judging by these pictures, he was a pleasant, family-orientated, well-turned out young man. As a sixth-grade pupil, Bergoglio attended Don Bosco school on Avenida de Mayo 1800 in Ramos Mejia, and decided to continue his quest for higher education. He holds a . degree as a chemical technician, but then chose the priesthood and . entered the seminary of Villa Devoto. He became a priest at 32, nearly a decade after losing a lung due to respiratory illness and quitting his chemistry studies. Despite his late start, he was leading the local Jesuit community within four years, holding the post from 1973 to 1979. From 1980 to 1986 he was rector of the Philosophical and Theological Faculty of San Miguel as well as pastor of the Patriarca San Jose parish in the Diocese of San Miguel. In March of 1986 he went to Germany to finish his doctoral thesis. Flashback: Jorge Mario Bergoglio (circled) attended Don Bosco school as a sixth grade pupil . Young buck: Jorge Mario Bergoglio, circled, stands at the top of the tree with friends and classmates . The superiors then sent him to the University of El Salvador and then to Cordoba where he served as a confessor and spiritual director. On 20 May 1992, John Paul II appointed him titular Bishop of Auca and Auxiliary of Buenos Aires. On June 3, 1997 he was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Buenos Aires and succeeded Cardinal Antonio Quarracino on 28 February 1998. During his time as Archbishop in his home city, his humility and 'man of the people' nature was all to evident as he travelled to some of the poorer parts of Buenos Aires delivering mass to communities. He refused to sample any luxuries in his life - he lived in a modest apartment, and often chose to use public transport to attend engagements, meetings and masses. He was created and proclaimed Cardinal by Blessed John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 2001, of the Title of S. Roberto Bellarmino (St. Robert Bellarmine). Student: Jorge Mario Bergoglio, circled, studied chemistry before joining the priesthood . Humble: Pope Francis has come a long way since his days of graduating in chemistry . Pope Francis has been described by commentators as a voice of conscience and a reconciler. Classed by some as a moderniser of a strict South American church, he is still conservative and an opponent of such ideas as gay marriage. Jorge Mario Bergoglio is the third Pontiff in a row who is not from Italy and the first in more than a millennium from outside Europe. Warm welcome: Newly elected Pope Francis and Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina waves from the steps of the Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica in Rome yesterday . His election to the Papacy signals the importance of the burgeoning strength of the church in Latin America and in Africa, now home to a growing proportion of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics. The election of the first Jesuit to the Papacy also represents the triumph of the order founded nearly 500 years ago, which has for centuries concentrated on mission around the globe, and particularly in the Americas. The Vatican said he chose the name Francis after St. Francis of Assisi, who formed the Franciscan order, saying that the new Pope is a 'lover of the poor'.","Pictures of Pope Francis as a child show a smart, well-turned out and cheery youngster .

Barlaston Hall, in Staffordshire, was sold for just £1 in 1981 because it was in a state of decay with rotting floor boards as it had been used for coal mining operations . The Grade-I listed mansion was sold as a dilapidated wreck for £1 just three decades ago, but is now on sale for £2.3 million . By the early 1980s, the hall was in a state of decay, with few repairs for many years and a serious threat of subsidence having been undermined by coal workings.

The library after its restoration - the renovation of the building is regarded as one of the most significant success stories in English heritage . The restoration of Barlaston Hall is seen as one of the most significant success stories in English heritage. It was built by architect Sir Robert Taylor for Thomas Mills in 1756, to replace the existing manor house he had acquired through marriage. In 1816, Rosamund Mills married Ralph Adderley and it was lived in by their son, Ralph Thomas Adderley who was a High Sheriff of Staffordshire. Following his death in 1931, the estate, which then compromised some 380 acres, was put up for sale and bought by the Wedgwood Pottery company in 1937. After World War Two, its safety (pictured left) was affected by coal mining operations and the fact it was on a geological fault, which led to severe cracks. It has since been restored (right) and is on the market for £2.3 million . Having acquired the mansion, the company built its factory and a model village for its workforce in its grounds. During World War Two, it was used by the Bank of England. After the War, it became the Wedgwood Memorial College. But it did not stay there for long as dry rot was found in it. Worse was to come as its safety was compromised by subsidence due to coal mining operations and the fact it was on a geological fault, which led to severe cracks. Wedgwood left it to decay and at the mercy of vandals. The drawing room in Barlaston Hall that was built by architect Sir Robert Taylor in 1756.

The mansion that was used by the Bank of England during World War Two has five bathrooms and is available to purchase for £2.3 million by estate agents Knight Frank . In a famous coup, SAVE Britain's Heritage, saved the mansion from the Wedgwood pottery company and purchased it for just £1 in 1981 . The mansion has eight bedrooms, five reception rooms and five bathrooms and sits within 4.5 acres of land . The company twice tried to have the Grade I listed building demolished. But in a famous conservation coup, SAVE Britain's Heritage - a group which championed the cause of decaying country houses -  saved the mansion and purchased it for just £1. The Heritage group was given further grants and a loan, which enabled them to complete the work in the 1990s. In 1992, it was bought by its current owners, James and Carol Hall, for £300,00 who restored the interior as it was conceived by architect Sir Robert Taylor when he first designed it. The complete restoration, with the help of the English Heritage, took five years to complete. They now hope the new owners will retain the hall's charms. The mansion sits beside the old church of St John the Baptist, which has a medieval tower and churchyard. It has been deconsecrated and is under different ownership from the hall. It can be purchased separately. The property stands on a wooded ridge above the valley of the Trent between the canal market town of Stone and just five-and-a-half miles from Stoke-on-Trent. Estate agent George Dennis, said: 'This house is a one-off in that Grade-I listed buildings don't come on the market very often. The building is a fine piece of architecture and the current owners have put a lot of money into the restoration. 'The reason why the owners are selling is because they are looking to move back to Scotland. It has been a home to them and this building is best suited for that purpose.' The Grade-I listed mansion was bought by the Wedgwood Pottery company in 1937 as a site to replace its operation a few miles away in an industrial part of Stoke-on-Trent. A new electric pottery and model village was built for its employees in the grounds. During the Second World War, it was used by the Bank of England because it was deemed to be structurally safe. From 1945, the hall housed the Wedgwood Memorial College, but when the building was found to contain dry rot, they left and moved elsewhere in the village. Wedgwood continued to maintain the Hall until the late 1960s. By the early 1980s, the hall was in a state of decay, with few repairs for many years. Wedgwood made two applications to have the building demolished. But SAVE Britain's Heritage preserved the mansion and purchased it for just £1 in 1981.","Grade-I listed Barlaston Hall, in Staffordshire, was sold for £1 just three decades ago, but is now on sale for £2.3m .

"THE FINAL SEASON by Nigel McCrery (Random House £14.99) Most of us are familiar with one football-related story from World War I — that during the so-called Christmas truce of 1914, British and German troops played each other along the Western Front. Football was the ‘common denominator that drew the two sides together for a few hours of peace and humanity amid the horrors of war’, writes Nigel McCrery in this fascinating book. He provides evidence that British Tommies lost one game 3‑2: ‘We can assume the Germans won on penalties,’ he adds, wryly. Celtic's William Angus showed true courage by saving a comrade's life . Already, by Christmas Day, 1914, Britain’s dead included some of the nation’s most feted footballers. In telling their stories, and those of the other players who perished, McCrery offers a new perspective on the conflict itself. There is Leigh Richmond Roose, the Welsh international once known as ‘the Prince of Goalkeepers’, an incorrigible entertainer who would sit on the crossbar at half-time, bantering with the crowd. He was also famously handsome — the Daily Mail called him ‘London’s most eligible bachelor’ — and was ‘close’ to the music hall star Marie Lloyd. Roose, who studied medicine at King’s College London, went with the Royal Army Medical Corps to Gallipoli. For many years, it was assumed, even by his family, that he died there. But he didn’t. He joined the 9th Royal Fusiliers as a humble private, evidently because he wanted to fight even more than he wanted to treat the wounded. He died the following summer on the Somme, but not before showing great heroism, and more than a little evidence of his goalkeeping skills, in resisting an attack by German troops armed with flame-throwers. According to the regimental history, Roose, though choking and burnt, ‘continued to throw bombs until his arm gave out’. Not all of these heroic former footballers died. McCrery tells the remarkable story of Corporal Willie Angus, the former Celtic player. In June 1915, he volunteered to crawl out, under constant fire and at the cost of his left eye and right foot, almost to the German lines to retrieve a badly-wounded officer, Lieutenant James Martin. Two months later, King George V presented him with the Victoria Cross. Even more thrillingly, perhaps, he received standing ovations from huge crowds at Celtic Park and Ibrox, home of Celtic’s bitter rivals Glasgow Rangers — on the very same day. Angus and Martin remained great friends for their rest of their lives. Martin died in 1956, Angus three years later. Another who survived the war, but not to play football again, was Pat Crossan, a Heart of Midlothian player famed for his incredible speed, and so devastatingly good-looking (or so he claimed) he used to boast that women came to matches just to see him. ‘Pat can maybe pass the ball, but he couldn’t pass a mirror if he tried,’ one of his teammates once joked. In a field hospital at the Somme, Crossan came within minutes of having his left foot amputated. It was saved by a captured German surgeon. 213 professional players fell in action in WW1 . The tales of these men before (and, in some cases, after) the war give this book a hugely poignant punch. The background story of football itself is also enthralling, for then, as now, those playing it professionally seemed to be the most gilded of young men. In 1914, there were almost 4,500 professional players in Britain, the best of them earning £4 a week legitimately, but much more ‘under the table’. By definition, they were among the fittest of their generation, yet few of them joined up at the outbreak of war, since Football Association secretary Frederick Wallhad decreed that (unlike rugby and cricket) the season would continue regardless. A few weeks later, author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (McCrery neglects to tell us Sherlock Holmes’s creator was an former goalkeeper) weighed in, appealing to footballers to fight for their country. Still they didn’t, causing widespread dismay. All of the 16th Royal Scots Battalion Football Team were either gassed or wounded in battle, with some later dying from their injuries . Then, as now, those governing football seemed to be a law unto themselves. However, the impasse was broken when 16 players for Hearts, then leading the Scottish First Division, joined a new battalion, the 16th Royal Scots. The next day, an English MP, William Joynson-Hicks, decided to raise a battalion of footballers, the 17th Middlesex. The 16th Royal Scots regiment, pictured in 195, were also keen footballers including Ducan Currie (far left) and Ernie Ellis (third from far left) Needless to say, they prospered in the inter-army football tournament, beating the 34th Brigade Royal Field Artillery 11-0 in the 1916 final. They distinguished themselves on the battlefield, too, but with significant losses. As for the 16th Royal Scots, machine-gun fire on the Somme yielded a terrible statistic: Hearts lost three of their finest players, Henry Wattie, Duncan Currie and Ernest Ellis, in under a minute. For those of us who love football, and still more for those who make fortunes playing it, all this sacrifice should offer considerable food for thought. Gary Lineker says as much in a thoughtful foreword. And, while McCrery’s book is not perfect, with a slightly ponderous prose style at times, I wish with all my heart a copy could be given to every Premier League player as he embarks on negotiations for another £20,000 a week.

"Warning: Ex-MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove said jihadists should not get the 'oxygen of publicity' The threat posed by 'pathetic' British jihadis is being exaggerated and the government should instead focus more on tensions such as those between Russia and Ukraine, the former head of MI6 has warned. Sir Richard Dearlove said the 9/11 attacks put a 'distortion' towards Islamic extremism in the public consciousness which has remained ever since. And he insisted the 'oxygen of publicity' being handed to young radicals could make them more dangerous than they really are. A former intelligence officer who served in Kenya, Switzerland, the U.S. and the Czech Republic, Sir Richard oversaw MI6 from 1999 to 2004 during the invasion of Iraq. He insisted the British and U.S.-led intervention in 2003 had 'probably very small significance' in relation to the current wave of terror sweeping through Iraq. That is despite many blaming the aftermath of the war for opening up a chasm which allowed the extremist group ISIS to take hold in key cities. Using social media to spread their wave of terror, ISIS militants have gained strongholds in several parts of Iraq over the last few months. Yesterday images emerged of almost a dozen ancient shrines and Shia mosques being destroyed. Sir Richard's comments, on the ninth anniversary of the London bombings, came after several young British jihadis signed up to fight in Syria and Iraq. Some, barely out of their teens, have appeared in recruitment videos pledging to give their lives in the name of religious fight. But Sir Richard argued much of the current conflict was 'Muslim on Muslim' and unlikely to affect those on British soil. In a speech to the Royal United Services Institute defence and security think tank (Rusi), he said: 'Despite . some of the blood-curdling claims made on our TV screens by young . British jihadis... this new conflict is essentially Muslim on . Muslim. Wave of terror: Images emerged yesterday showing almost a dozen ancient shrines and Shia mosques being destroyed in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Sir Richard said the conflict is largely 'Muslim on Muslim' The images were posted on a website which carries official statements from the Islamic State extremist group . 'It is time to move away . from the distortion that 9/11 understandably created in our national . security stance. 'Counter-terrorism activity will . remain an important requirement but it should no longer dominate our . national security thinking and planning, rather a problem we have . learned to live with and that should seldom be given, either by the . Government or the media, the oxygen of publicity. 'We . must continue to cover the Middle East as a political requirement but . without putting the incipient terrorist threat to ourselves at the . centre of the picture and, in particular, without demonising our own . Muslim community on account of the small number of their young men who . were tragically sucked into the conflict and risk returning home in an . ugly and dangerous frame of mind.' Sir Richard, who has been the Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge, since he left MI6 in 2004, blamed ministers for 'warning us again and again about the seriousness of the terrorist problems that we face' and blamed the media for making extremists into 'monsters'. 'I feel deeply uncomfortable to see our national media making national security monsters out of rather misguided young men from our Muslim communities who frankly, I think, cut rather pathetic figures,' he said. Probe: Security agencies in Iraq were yesterday working to verify a video of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured), the leader of Islamic State, purportedly delivering a sermon at the Great Mosque in Mosul . 'They achieve celebrity status beyond their wildest dreams and are probably actually encouraged by the attention towards fulfilment of some of their more extreme radical fantasies. 'Surely better to ignore them and assume the means to control them, if and when they do come home, are sufficient to meet the threat that they pose.' Britain's resources would be better-served focusing more on other issues such as the growing dominance of China or political populism in Europe, he said. The Russian incursion into Ukraine will have provoked a 'lively debate' about the share of resources that should be moved from counter-terrorism to other threats, he added.","Ex-intelligence chief made remarks in a speech in London yesterday .

"OPERATION SEALION by Leo McKinstry (John Murray £25) During May 1940, the Nazi blitzkrieg swept through France in a matter of days. Denmark, Norway, Belgium and Holland too were crushed with lightning speed. Britain stood alone against Hitler’s domination of Europe. The traditional view of what happened next has long been that we were saved only by the superiority of the RAF’s Spitfires and Hurricanes to the Luftwaffe’s Messerschmitts, and the gallantry of the men who flew them. If we had lost the Battle of Britain, all that stood between us and a fascist future was the Home Guard, a Dad’s Army of oldsters armed with broomsticks. Defenders of the Home Front: The Home Guard (inspiration for TV show Dad's Army) were a formidable force . Leo McKinstry’s engrossing, forensic review of the evidence challenges that idea and exposes some myths along the way. Not only was Britain well armed and prepared, but the Germans weren’t very eager to invade us anyway. At the time France fell and the British Expeditionary Force scrambled its way home from Dunkirk, there was no German plan to invade Britain. Hitler, a huge admirer of the British Empire and the way it was run, expected us to seek peace terms. And there were plenty this side of the Channel who wanted to, especially some Tory members of the coalition government, led by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax. Of course, Winston Churchill was fiercely opposed to any settlement, and his stance held sway with the support of Labour and Liberal members of the government. 'We shall fight them on the beaches': Winston Churchill inspects the guard of honour of the Home Guard . Faced with Britain’s defiance, Hitler himself disagreed with some of his military staff, who were eager to continue the momentum across Europe and finish the job. He had no interest in naval warfare and believed that, isolated from imports by a U-boat cordon, Britain would be worn down until she made terms. 25,000 Londoners were made homeless in the first two weeks of the Blitz . There were good military reasons for his caution, too. Mostly there was the Royal Navy, the mightiest sea force in the world with ten times as many ships as the Germans had and the right ones too, 13 battleships to their two, 169 destroyers to their ten. Even if Germany succeeded in attaining air superiority, it would be risky to take hundreds of troop-carrying craft across the notoriously choppy English Channel while under fire from our ships. To put the difficulty into context, going the other way, four years later, the Allies took two years planning and rehearsing D-Day, had massive air and sea superiority and even then only just made it. Churchill himself was sceptical about the threat of invasion. And contrary to myth, Britain was well prepared. Well-armed and well-prepared: Home Guards patrol on a country road near Brighton . British factories were turning out fighter planes faster than the Germans, with nearly 500 being produced in July alone. And we had a massive army. By mid-July we had 1,300,000 regular troops, plus 600,000 Local Defence Volunteers — later renamed the Home Guard by Churchill. While it’s true the latter included at least one man as old as Dad’s Army’s Corporal Jones, the average age was actually 35. Rather than being a bunch of well-meaning duffers led by pompous twits, most were former servicemen with sound military knowledge. And although they initially had no weapons and trained with broomsticks, they were soon well equipped with 615,000 rifles from the U.S. Putting up a fight: Leo McKinstry's admirable book sets the record about the Home Guard straight . All in all, they could have put up a decent fight. It’s also a mistake to forget the stunningly efficient way that countless pillboxes and other defences were thrown up around the country. Unfortunately, this fed paranoid rumours that the invasion was imminent. One rumour — repeated in Dad’s Army — claimed that a force of Germans dressed as nuns was spreading across the country, although they could be detected by their hairy forearms. It was also feared German paratroopers might land dressed in British uniforms taken from men who had been captured at Dunkirk. General Montgomery advised that the simplest way to rumble them was to make them take off their helmets — as ‘the very marked square-head of the Teuton can easily be recognised’. In mid-July, smarting under English insults, Hitler finally gave the go-ahead for the invasion, codenamed Operation Sealion. As it was considered an impos-sible undertaking beyond mid-September because of worsening weather, he gave his underlings a month to prepare. It was a logistical nightmare. The Germans possessed no landing craft, troop carriers that could be driven right up onto a beach. They rapidly began amassing a collection of barges and other commercial boats from all over Europe, 1,910 in total, plus 419 tugs to tow them. As the tugs couldn’t pull them right to the shore, the men would have to jump out in deep water and wade to land under fire. Post-invasion plans included taking all able-bodied Britons aged 17-45 to Germany as slave labour, and Nelson’s column to Berlin. But it was all pie in the sky. The RAF began making raids on the assembling invasion force, damaging 12 per cent of it, a demonstration of what might happen to an actual attempt. The Royal Navy attacked German ships in port, while back home the security forces proved remarkably adept at rounding up German spies. Formidable and dangerous foe: Footage of Home guard soldiers training during the early months of the war . After a bombastic speech on September 4 that an invasion was imminent, Hitler again began to have cold feet. The finalenail in the coffin was September 15, Battle of Britain Day, when the RAF downed 60 German fighters, for a loss of 26. Clearly Germany did not command the skies. Two days later, the Fuhrer announced that Operation Sealion was postponed and the fleet began dispersing because of RAF bombing attacks. It proved the end of Sealion, as Hitler’s attention turned East and Operation Barbarossa, the attack on Russia the following year. Far from being a sitting duck, Britain — even at its loneliest and most exposed — had proved too dangerous and formidable a foe for the Nazis to tackle head-on. In our self-deprecating way, we rather forget how ruthless and proficient our preparations against invasion actually were and tend to treat this particular chapter of our national story almost as a joke. McKinstry’s admirable book sets the record straight.","During May 1940 Britain stood alone against Hitler’s domination of Europe .
Many believe  all that stood between us and a fascist future was the Home Guard, a Dad’s Army of oldsters armed with broomsticks .

"'Earn your place': Liv Garfield is set to become the youngest woman ever to lead a FTSE 100 company . From travelling 90 miles to football matches every weekend with her dad, to bringing up two sons, she is used to being in a man’s world. Which is probably just as well – since Liv Garfield is about to join one of the most exclusive men’s clubs of all. The mother-of-two is set to become the youngest woman ever to lead a FTSE 100 company. The granddaughter of an Everton football club groundsman will make history when she leaves BT early next year to become head of water giant Severn Trent. As a female chief executive of a FTSE firm, she will be joining one of the smallest and most exclusive groups in British corporate life. And at 38, she will also become the youngest woman ever to ascend to the top of a blue chip company. The Footsie blue chip index lists the 100 biggest companies in the London Stock Exchange, and includes corporate giants such as Vodafone, Shell and Tesco. Currently only three companies in the index – airline easyJet, cigarette firm Imperial Tobacco and fashion label Burberry – have female chief executives, making Mrs Garfield’s arrival all the more remarkable. But there is one ambition she still has the occasional daydream about. She told the Mail: ‘I said for my entire childhood that I wanted to be the Everton manager, so that was my absolute ambition. ‘My mum had my bedroom with pink and fluffy clouds and I spent my childhood pinning up Everton pin-ups over them.’ From the age of five, she would travel every weekend with her dad to the Everton match – even though her family lived 90 miles away in Harrogate. ‘My grandparents are all Scousers. My dad and I used to go with my granddad,’ she said. ‘That was normal for me.’ Successful: Liv Garfield with Prime Minister David Cameron in March earlier this year . Now the Cambridge graduate takes her . two young sons to the game most weekends – and is trying to dissuade her . youngest, aged two, from switching his support to Chelsea. Her husband Morgan runs a property investment fund. She said her biggest mistake in the past was buying a sports car, only to discover that she was pregnant. ‘I couldn’t get into it,’ she said. But that was the only time family life has held her back – and she said she never encountered the ‘glass ceiling’ that prevents many women rising to the top. Despite being a hugely successful businesswoman, Mrs Garfield's regret is not becoming the Everton manager . ‘I didn’t find getting back on the ladder [after motherhood] hard,’ she said. ‘For any female to do well in business you have to ignore the fact that you are female. 'You have got to earn your place based on your own qualities and abilities.’ And her approach certainly seems to work. In September, she was ranked as number ten in Fortune Magazine’s hottest rising business stars, putting her alongside success stories such as Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, and making her the highest ranked Briton. In addition to the three existing FTSE 100 companies led by women, Royal Mail, which floated last month and is led by Canadian Moya Greene, is expected to enter the FTSE 100 next month. Unless any of the companies drop out of the index, Mrs Garfield will be the fifth female chief executive when she takes up her new role. She was educated at the independent Birklands Belmont School – now the £8,733-a-year Belmont Grosvenor – in Birstwith, near Harrogate, and then at Bootham School in York, which charges up to £15,990 annually for day pupils and £26,115 for borders. During school holidays she would help her parents run their project management business. After studying French and German at Cambridge, she worked at management consultancy Accenture for six years. She joined BT in 2000 and will now move to Severn Trent, which supplies water to about four million households across the Midlands and Wales. The job, which could pay up to £2.4million a year, will see her lead the largest water company listed on the London Stock Exchange. She said it was a ‘huge wrench’ to leave BT, but added: ‘I have every confidence it will continue to thrive. I am really looking forward to joining Severn Trent.’","Liv Garfield to become youngest woman ever to lead a FTSE 100 company .

"A British tourist has collapsed and died after suffering severe altitude sickness during a dream holiday to South America. Father-of-three Stephen Mortimer, 68, was taken ill as he waited for a bus to the world famous Machu Picchu site high in the Peruvian Andes. The retired sea pilot was rushed to a local medical centre but died soon afterwards. Dream holiday: Steve Mortimer, seen on a recent trip to Camden Lock in London with his wife Marian, died from altitude sickness at Machu Picchu at the start of a trip of a lifetime to South America . Dad-of-three Steve Mortimer, 68, died at the 15th-century Inca site Machu Picchu in Peru . His family say they were told by a local coroner that he suffered a fatal heart attack linked to problems caused by the high altitude. Mr Mortimer had been suffering from breathlessness for days before he collapsed in the town of Aguas Calientes, where he was waiting with his wife to be bussed to the site at 8,000ft above sea level. Daughter Kathryn, 23, said her father’s symptoms had been more acute than others in the tour group he was travelling with. ‘He suffered a heart attack but it was the altitude that brought it on,’ she said. His widow Marian, 59, described her husband as the ‘kindest, most generous, fun-loving man’. ‘You only had to be in his company for five minutes – he put everyone at ease,’ she added. ‘He really was the life and soul of the party. We had the most amazing marriage. I am so lucky to have him in my life.’ Mr Mortimer died on July 29, two weeks into the trip. 'Fun-loving': Mr Mortimer and his wife had talked about visiting the famous Peruvian site for the past 30 years . But Mrs Mortimer was stranded in Peru for more than a week after their passports were damaged in a hotel laundry. The teacher was turned away from the first flight she booked and had to arrange emergency travel documents so she could return home to Kirkbymoorside, North Yorkshire. ‘It was horrendous, your worst nightmare,’ she said. ‘We were an organised tour and six young people in the same group cancelled the rest of their holidays to wait for me in Peru so that I wouldn’t be alone.’ Mr Mortimer had two sons, Jason, 45, and Daniel, 43, from a previous marriage and daughter Kathryn with Mrs Mortimer. He rose to the rank of captain in the Merchant Navy and worked as a Humber sea pilot before retiring in 2011. He and his wife were seasoned travellers, visiting China, Australia and North America, and were on the second leg of a world tour when Mr Mortimer died. It is believed he died of altitude sickness. The popular tourist spot lies around 8,000ft above sea level . The pair had wanted to visit Peru’s top tourist attraction, known as the Lost City of the Incas, for 30 years. Last September tourist Adam Savory, 25, from Eastbourne, collapsed and died in Peru while visiting the city of Cusco, which lies 11,000ft above sea level. He had suffered altitude sickness symptoms for days before he was taken to hospital, where his condition deteriorated and he died. His family have now set up the charity Para-Monte to highlight the dangers of altitude sickness and raise funds for research into the potentially fatal problem. His mother Jeannet, 59, a college lecturer, said yesterday: ‘Altitude sickness is very unforgiving and doesn’t discriminate against sex or age or fitness. ‘We would urge people with symptoms to get medical advice from a local doctor straight away and not leave it for a few days in the hope it will improve.’","Steve Mortimer died at the popular history spot in the mountains of Peru .

Data from Flightradar showed the AIrbus A330 - flying from London to Beijing - circling over Sussex and the English Channel at 8,000ft before finally returning to the airport. It took off as scheduled at 1.30pm but landed almost two hours later after reportedly dumping fuel, which is usually done to lighten the aircraft or reduce the risk of fire. Passengers claim that the captain announced the gear could not be retracted after take-off, requiring them to return to London. An observer on the ground reported the wheels at the front of the aircraft had been lifted up, but the main landing gear towards the read of the plane appeared to still be down when the aircraft climbed out of Gatwick. The runway at Gatwick airport was closed for 20 minutes before the plane was towed to a stand . A spokesperson at Gatwick said the runway was closed shortly after 3.20pm but was re-opened around 20 minutes later before the plane towed to a stand. He added: 'Due to a technical issue, an Air China aircraft had to make a return journey to Gatwick Airport. 'It landed safely with no injury to passengers. The runway was temporarily closed‎ while the aircraft was safely taxiied to a stand. 'The runway was reopened within 20 minutes and as a result there were some minor delays to outbound aircraft.' The flight landed safely and no injuries were reported on board.","Pilots sent out a 'squawk' code - the international signal for an emergency .

"A tiny Victorian garage on a millionaire’s row has gone on the market for a whopping £80,000. The lock-up in Cambridge on a road with an average house price of £900,000 has been described as a ‘Victorian detached’ in an ‘outstanding location just to the north of the river’. The current owners are hoping the bubbling housing market and competition for property in the university city on Chesterton Hall Crescent will bag them a generous £80,000. Scroll down for video . Garage for £80,000: The lock-up in Cambridge is in an 'outstanding location just to the north of the river' Pricey location: Measuring just 20ft by 12ft, the garage in Cambridge comes with a 20ft by 13ft forecourt . Measuring just 20ft by 12ft, the garage comes with a 20ft by 13ft forecourt - but you can’t even sleep there, after a planning application to turn it into a home was refused by the council in 2004. But changes to planning laws could mean permission may be granted by the council in the future. Chris Carey, head of residential with Bidwells estate agents, said: ‘The price reflects the fact that in Cambridge it very difficult to find off street parking in the more urban areas. ‘And if someone owns a house in a street where house prices are up to a million pounds then they will want off street parking to go with the property, because that’s what buyers want. ‘It may not have planning permission to be a dwelling now but 10 years down the line it may and then £80,000 will look cheap. Cambridge is reflecting what is happening in London where garages are going for £300,000 to £400,000.’ The priciest recent sale on the road was £1,245,000 for a five-bedroom semi-detached house in August 2013. That is also the road's most expensive home by current value, according to Zoopla. From above: A planning application to turn the garage into a home was refused by the council in 2004 . Expensive: The average house price on Chesterton Hall Crescent in the university city is £900,000 . Cambridge house prices have soared by 20 per cent with property website Rightmove estimating the cost of an average home in the city as £419,000. It has also become the fastest selling city in Britain. The Nationwide house price index, published in April, found average Cambridge prices are higher than those in London - £406,040 to £401,000. 'If someone owns a house in a street where house prices are up to a million pounds then they will want off street parking to go with the property, because that’s what buyers want' Chris Carey, Bidwells estate agents . Nick Redmayne, of estate agents Redmayne Arnold & Harris, which is representing the owner of the garage, said: ‘It was refused planning permission 10 years ago to be a dwelling but it may be easier now. But it could be an office studio or a place to park some very nice cars. 'I don’t think this is really a reflection on house prices in Cambridge or parking. It is an unusual property. It also has an inspection pit so it may be for someone who likes to fix up cars or turn it into a business.’ A new record was set in April for the most expensive garage in Britain, after a 568ft former coach house in Camberwell, south London, was sold for £550,000 - triple the asking price.","Cambridge garage in 'outstanding location just to the north of the river'

"Diane Sheridan got more than she bargained for during a shopping trip yesterday - when her romantic boyfriend proposed to her via a huge 23ft TV screen. Ms Sheridan 26, was at the Intu Braehead shopping centre in Glasgow with her partner when a video of her daughter Lilly was broadcast to shoppers. Then her partner Tony Moore, 43, appeared on the huge 23ft by 13ft screen, went down on one knee and popped the question. Scroll down for video . Diane Sheridan and her now fiance Tony Moore, from Glasgow, celebrate their engagement with a kiss . Mr Moore surprised his partner Diane Sheridan by playing a video of the proposal on a shopping mall's giant TV screen at Intu Braehead mall, in Glasgow. Fortunately, she said yes to the proposal . He had taken her along to the shopping mall after telling her he had won a prize in a competition which he needed to collect. Family members including aunts, and uncle were also hiding nearby after finding out about the proposal plans only days before. And as they were waiting to collect the 'prize' Tony's video flashed up on screen. She said: 'I thought what the hell is going on here? I kind of smelt a rat. 'I thought it seemed a bit much for a competition. Then I saw Lilly on screen and I wondered how they managed to get those images because she was dressed differently. 'I was shocked, I can be quite shy sometimes. I saw family members nearby when we were waiting so I thought something might be up.' She looked speechless as she saw her partner on the big screen before he got down on one knee on screen to present a sparkling diamond ring. The engagement ring Tony Moore bought his partner - which she happily accepted . The couple, pictured after their engagement at Intu Braehead mall, have been together for two-and-a-half years . The couple have been together for two-and-half-years and he had been planning to propose for a while. The driver for Marks and Spencer's said: 'I've been thinking about it for quite a wee while but I couldn't afford to get a ring at the time. 'I wasn't planning something as big as this and I was worried about how she would react. Newly engaged Diane Sheridan and Tony Moore with their 14-month old daughter Lily and Tony's stepson Declan . 'I just thought about what I wanted to do for a while. 'The video was brilliant and I couldn't wait for it to be shown on the big screen. 'I liked the idea of proposing in the video because as well as being very unusual, it was also quite personal. 'Diane knows every time I do something I like to push the boat out and don't do things low-key.' Mr Moore also has a 10-year-old stepson, Declan who was at Braehead to see the unusual proposal alongside their daughter Lily. The full-time mum - who said yes - said the pair would celebrate with a few glasses of champagne to get over the shock. She said: 'We're definitely going to have a glass of bubbly - or maybe a few bottles to get over the shock.' The proposal video was played yesterday afternoon in between the latest music videos, news bulletins and adverts normally shown on the screen. In the video, he said: 'Hi Diane, surprise! Bet you weren't expecting to see me here. 'I told you a wee bit of a lie on Monday when I said I was going to see the mortgage adviser. 'I was over in Braehead making this video and I feel as if it's time now, we have been together for a wee while - yourself, Declan and now we have got beautiful Lilly. 'I want to do this - will you marry me Diane? Please say yes.' Assistant marketing manager for intu Braehead, Christine Macdonald said: 'I'm sure Diane won't forget this shopping trip in a hurry and we wish the happy couple all the very best for the future.'","Boyfriend Tony Moore proposed via a 23ft TV screen during shopping trip .

"A toddler has become an unlikely internet sensation after taking part in the Ice Bucket Challenge before promptly blurting out the F-word - much to the horror of her grandmother. Three-year-old Scarlett-Rose Davis begged her grandparents to let her take part in the craze which is currently taking the world by storm in aid of motor neurone disease. But grandmother Carla Davis-Ball, said she 'could have died' when the little girl blurted out 'f***ing hell' after tipping an icy bucket of water over her head - and the episode was all caught on camera. Scarlett begged her grandparents to take part in the challenge. They agreed but insisted on warm water . Potty mouth: Three-year-old Scarlett-Rose Davis turned the air blue during an ice bucket challenge - and her doting grandparents have now revealed she intends to try out for Britain's Got Talent as a rapper . Mrs Davis-Ball recorded the footage of Scarlett-Rose being doused with warm water from a cooking pot after nominating a young friend called Marshall to take the challenge last weekend. After she put . it on Facebook and her husband Stuart Ball, 33, uploaded it to YouTube, . it has been viewed more than 40,000 times since Monday, and has been shared several thousand times around the world. The 40-year-old, from Coalpool in Walsall, West Midlands, said: 'I couldn't believe it when she came out with that language. Staying warm: Mrs Davie-Brown did not want Scarlett-Rose to be cold, so she was allowed to do the challenge on the condition she used warm water from a cooking pot instead of a bucket of ice . Back for more: Scarlett-Rose has a second go at the challenge - this time with a smile on her face . Polite: Mrs Davis-Ball joked the three-year-old would have to watch her language on the television show . 'She has picked up a few bad words when we have gone out for meals or into town. 'It did shock me but she's so clever I'm not surprised she's picked it up. We told her it was a naughty word. 'Children have brains like sponges and I can't stop it. But she does know it's wrong. 'I have to say when I heard her swearing I nearly died with laughter. I know it's wrong but it's the same reaction most adults would have after being drenched in ice water. 'We did tell her not to say rude words and she is normally very good and polite.'

The video captures the moment the little girl stomps off after her icy challenge - exclaiming 'f***ing hell' She begged her grandparents to let her take part in the ice bucket challenge and they agreed only if they could use warm water. 'She had seen some of the ice bucket videos on my phone and seen one of my friends do it,' said mother-of-three Mrs Davis-Ball. 'She said: ""Nanny, can I do that?"" 'I wasn't keen on her having ice water poured over her so I said we'd use warm water from the cooking pot. 'It makes me so happy that a three-year-old picked on a good cause and wanted to get involved. She knows it's for poorly people.' Scarlett-Rose has a baby brother called Shankley-Gary, aged ten months. The couple care for the children five nights a week and they spend two nights with their mother Demi Davis, 19.

'We're . very proud she took part in the ice bucket challenge and if her . swearing raises more money for the charity then it's a positive . outcome.' Scarlett-Rose is not the youngest person to take the ice bucket challenge. A video of a seven-month-old baby having a small plastic cup of water poured over its head was also posted on YouTube earlier this month. The craze has raised £48 million in less than a month in aid of research into motor neurone disease. The disease affects the brain and the spinal cord, causing motor neurones to degenerate and die, leading to gradual paralysis and eventually death.","Scarlett-Rose Davis, 3, begged grandparents to let her take part in craze .

"For some parents, persuading their children to eat fruit and vegetables can be an arduous task. But not for the parents of toddler Max Billingham who lives on a diet of carrots, potatoes and bananas. The two-year-old, from Felling in Gateshead, has a rare condition which means he is allergic to almost all foods. He risks going into shock, turning blue and ending up in hospital if he eats anything else. Two year old Max Billington, from Felling in Gateshead, was diagnosed with food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) and dysmotility of the bowel as a baby meaning he is allergic to most foods . Max, who is allergic to all foods other than potatoes, carrots and bananas, has recently undergone surgery to have a feeding pump fitted to get food into his body . Doctors diagnosed Max with the allergy when he was a baby. But since then the list of foods he is allergic to, which currently includes chicken, blueberries and rice, grows by the day. Max lives on a special milk formula and has recently had an operation where surgeons inserted a pump, allowing him to be fed for 14 hours a day. Max's mother, Laura Billingam said it is a difficult condition to manage because her son doesn't understand why he is different from other children. She said: 'It's really stressful because everything revolves around food. 'A lot of social events include going out for meals or a buffet. He just doesn't understand why he can't have the food.' Max, who was born eight weeks premature, suffered a severe reaction to milk and foods as a baby prompting doctors to carry out food tests. Food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome or FPIES is a severe reaction to food proteins that happens one to four hours after a problematic food is ingested. The condition primarily occurs in infants, with most outgrowing it by the age of three, but it can also exist in adults and older children. At its most extreme, the allergy sparks vomiting, diarrhoea and a shock-like state. The exact cause within the body is unknown. The most common problem foods are milk and soy protein, but rice, chicken, oats, peanuts, potato and fish are also known to have caused problems. The condition is often missed by paediatricians because it does not spark the usual immune response and is not traceable through typical allergy tests. Skin prick tests for allergies come up negative. He was diagnosed with the rare condition food protein induced enterocolitis (FPIES) and dysmotility of the bowel as a baby. His family say his disease has baffled doctors and he is the only child in the North East they know to be living with both conditions. 'Some of the doctors haven't even heard of it,' said Mrs Billington, a children's nurse. 'To look at him you wouldn't think anything was wrong but he's really ill and we're constantly in and out of hospital.' This week Max was fitted with a feeding pump which will be used to get food into his body, and he will remain in hospital for another eight weeks. Although he may grow out of the disorder as he gets older, he might have to live with the feeding pump for the rest of his life. Mrs Billington and husband Scott, 33, a driving instructor, will soon make the trip to specialist hospital Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, where experts will assess Max's condition. The couple, who are also parents to four-year-old Halle, said it is a very difficult time for the family but they want to raise awareness of Max's condition. Mrs Billington said she is constantly worried abouther son suffering an allergic reaction. She said: 'It's a case of trial and error and often you don't know what foods have caused his reaction as sometimes the chronic reaction can be delayed. Max' mother Laura Billingham says she is thankful that his nursery school, have been incredibly supportive, taking Max into another room during lunchtimes so an allergic reaction is not triggered . 'My daughter once had a biscuit and he ate the tiniest of crumbs and he was poorly. It's a horrible condition and we just want to raise awareness.' She said that staff at Max's nursery school in Swalwell, Gateshead, have been incredibly supportive. She said: 'The nursery has been a lifesaver. They take him into a different room when the other children are eating and they've just been a huge support.' Next week family and friends will take part in a coast to coast cycle race to raise money for ongoing test for Max. You can donate by logging into his Just Giving page.","Max Billingham was diagnosed with food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) and dysmotility of the bowel as a baby .

"Passengers in cars and taxis are being exposed to air pollution up to 15 times greater than cyclists and pedestrians on busy city streets, a new study has found. Travelling inside a vehicle could be much worse than cycling by the kerb or walking on the pavement because emissions are highest in the centre of the carriageway, where vehicles suck in dirty air from those in front, scientists say. Their shocking findings were revealed following an experiment by a group of five MPs who sit on the Government’s cross-party Environmental Audit Committee (EAC). People in cars and taxis are being exposed to far more air pollution than those cycling and on foot . Each was provided with a gadget to measure airborne pollution levels, as well as a GPS tracker device, by scientists from King’s College London, who analysed where pollution was at its highest during their travels across London and in their constituencies over a week in July. By far the highest levels of tiny particles of ‘black carbon’ or deadly soot breathed in by the MPs was during taxi journeys in cities. On average each inhaled around 50 million particles per breath while inside a cab in London, around seven times more than the six to seven million particles per breath inhaled while walking around Whitehall or Oxford Street, and 15 times greater than levels recorded outside their eventual destination City Hall where, on leaving the cab, levels fell to three million particles per breath. London Mayor Boris Johnson (right) is expected to announce a new initiative to combat pollution next week in the wake of Joan Walley (left) and the rest of the EAC's findings . The findings are worrying because persistent inhalation of air pollution and traffic emissions have been linked to lower life expectancy and serious illnesses, including heart disease and cancer, as well as low birth weights and stunted lung development in children. Ben Barratt, a lecturer and air quality scientist at King’s College, said that air pollutants, such as black carbon, nitrogen dioxide and the toxic leftovers of inefficiently burnt fuel, were highest in the middle of a carriageway and in the first two to three feet above the road, dropping off nearer to the kerb and pavement. ‘Travelling in vehicles gave the greatest average exposure,’ Dr Barratt said. Five MPs carried out the Environmental Audit Committee study in London taxis . ‘When you are in a vehicle, nose to tail with those in front, you are right in the middle of the source of the pollution. ‘Vehicles close together suck in each other’s emissions. ‘The air intakes are in the engine compartment close to road level, so they pick up the fumes emitted by the vehicle in front of them. Open windows are another route.’ Dr Barratt said often dirty air became trapped in cars and taxis, whereas cyclists and pedestrians had a constant ‘flow of air’ breezing in from all directions around them. The MPs who took part in the research were chairwoman of the EAC Joan Walley, fellow Labour MPs Alan Whitehead and Mike Kane, and Conservatives Caroline Nokes and Matthew Offord. They are investigating why diesel engines, which are now recognised as some of the worst pollutants, were mistakenly promoted by officials as environmentally friendly. On Wednesday, London Mayor Boris Johnson will appear before the EAC to explain why the capital persistently breaches EU standards on pollution levels. Mr Johnson is expected to announce an new initiative – Breathe Better Together – where commuters will be asked to work from home or use bikes, trains and buses instead of cars and taxis when air pollution levels are highest. However, it is not just in London where pollution is a problem. Mrs Walley’s monitor saw her inhale more than 80 million particles per breath during a car journey in her Stoke-on-Trent North constituency, while Mr Kane was exposed to 20 million particles per breath during a cab ride in Manchester. Dense smog hangs over London, obscuring buildings like The Shard earlier this year . Mrs Walley said: ‘Our monitoring equipment showed that people in vehicles were far more exposed to air pollution than they would be walking. ‘Car makers test exhaust emissions but this raises a question about whether they should also be considering air quality inside vehicles.’ Research suggests that up to 29,000 premature deaths are caused each year in Britain by pollution - 10 times the number of people killed in road accidents. Those who live in big cities have a lower life expectancy, studies have found, because of poor air quality. London has by far the worst air pollution problem in the country - in 2010, 3,389 people died and 41,404 years of life were lost as a result of air pollution in the capital, according to Public Health England. The biggest concern is the tiny bits of carbon - around 30 times smaller than a human hair - which are so small they can get into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, passing through major organs, such as the heart and brain. They can have immediate effects on people with existing health conditions, triggering asthma attacks, heart attacks and strokes. But, worryingly, pollution can also cause diseases in healthy individuals, such as heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and even cancer.","People in cars exposed to up to 15 times pollution of walkers and cyclists .

"A girl who was driven to quit college when she was bullied for her looks feels she has now had the last laugh by becoming a beauty queen. Jade Colcombe, 20, dropped out of college after she was subjected to a torrent of abuse by bullies who said she looked like a man. From the age of 12, tormented Jade, from Tonypandy, Wales, would skip school and fake illness in a desperate attempt to avoid the verbal abuse which reduced her to tears on a daily basis. Her school bullies even threatened to kill her because she wore 'tomboy' clothes instead of make-up or expensive branded clothing. Jade has overcome years of torment and low-self esteem, conquering her own personal demons by entering beauty contests . Jade, here with her mother, was tormented by bullies at school from a young age . The bullies called Jade a host of names, including 'a man', leaving her in tears nearly every day . Jade explained: 'There have been times where I just felt like breaking down a crying. 'I'd walk into the room and the 'popular' gang would sit and snigger just because I didn't have expensive clothes or wear make-up. 'I was called 'buck-tooth', because of my teeth, 'Dalmatian', because of my beauty spots and 'man' because the hair on my arm was dark and noticeable. 'The thought of having to go back to school as a total outcast really got me down.' Jade, who started doing karate at the age of 11 for self-protection, says she quit sixth form halfway through her A levels because she felt like an 'outcast'. Jade was encouraged by family to enter Miss Radiant Photogenic UK 2014 to build her confidence . Jade was shocked when she was crowned queen and now won second title, Miss Supermodel Great Britain . Instead, she went on to study art and design at another college, but despite the change, still found the girls would snigger at her dress sense and call her ugly and stupid. However, defiant Jade hit back at her bullies in the most unexpected way. After enduring years of put downs from bullies who told her she would achieve nothing in life, she was encouraged by family and friends to enter Miss Radiant Photogenic UK 2014 to build her confidence and prove her bullies wrong. To her amazement, she was crowned queen, which spurred her on to claim her second title, Miss Supermodel Great Britain 2014 at Dream Street's Miss United Kingdom pageant, earlier this month. And despite dropping out of her A levels, she's now secured a top job as a quantity surveyor. She said: 'To be honest, the bullies did me a favour. 'At my lowest point, I refused to talk to anyone because I feared that they would just laugh at me. 'But for the first time at Miss UK, I actually spoke in front of an audience without getting upset or really nervous about it. 'And now that I am entering national pageants all over the UK, I really feel like I've beat those bullies and proved them wrong.' Since then, Jade has set her sights on her third title at the final of Miss British Empire Wales. Jade with her sister  age two, who suffers from a non-curable form of epilepsy . But despite conquering her own personal demons, Jade says she is yet to face the biggest challenge of her life - climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. She's attempting to climb 19,341 feet above sea level, in a bid to raise funds for Noah's Ark - a children's hospital in Wales. She says her sister, Lexi, age two, who suffers from a non-curable form of epilepsy, was saved by doctors at the hospital after violent seizures left her clinging to life. She said: 'Doctors at Noah's Ark were amazing, they saved my sister's life. 'It's definitely going to be a big challenge, but I feel that I needed to give them something back. 'I beat my bullies, so with the support of my family, beating Kilimanjaro should be no problem.'","From 12 bullying meant Jade would skip school as often as possible .

"Gauges in tank at Plymouth University measured water motion and sent electronic signals to a synthesizer which created the Orchestra Of Waves . A composer dubbed 'King Canute' has today become the first in the world to perform music created by waves - in a swimming pool. Dr Alexis Kirke transformed his body into a 'giant baton' by covering himself with motion sensors that controlled the water in a massive wave tank at the University of Plymouth, Devon. The more he moved his arms, the louder and more intense the music became - just like a normal conductor. Dr Kirke, 42, used the sensors on his arms to manipulate the number and size of waves created by 24 giant paddles in the pool. Scroll down for video . Dr Alexis Kirke performed his pioneering piece of music at Plymouth University in Devon by controlling waves in a massive water tank . His movements controlled waves in the tank and gauges in the water then measured the water’s movements. The gauges sent electronic signals to a synthesizer which created the music, which vaguely resembled whale song. Raising his arms changed the pitch of the sound while joysticks also enabled him to change the volume. Dr Kirke’s Orchestra Of Waves was watched by hundreds of people at the university. It was performed after the Duke of . Edinburgh opened the university’s new £19million Marine Building, . which contains the 35m by 15m tank. Gauges in the tank monitored the wave motion and sent electronic signals to a synthesizer which created the music . By raising his arms, Dr Kirke changed the pitch of the music while joysticks also enabled him to change the volume. His Orchestra Of Waves was watched by hundreds of people at the university . Dr Kirke has put together the 12-minute show with co-composer Samuel Freeman, . Dr Kirke said: 'I told him I wanted to be like King Canute, controlling the waves. 'The show went very well and people in the audience were asking whether they could buy the music. 'You are in a building and hear the noise of the waves and the smell and see them crashing down. 'There’s no way of explaining what it’s like to have dramatic sounds synchronized with that.' The pool also contained a special buoy which made a sound like a deep bell ringing when hit by a wave. The more the waves struck it, the more times the bells rang. Four students joined in with drumming. Foolish or wise? An illustration showing King Canute on his throne at the sea shore . Canute, the second son of King Sweyn of Denmark, became King of England in 1017. An effective ruler, he created a unified system of government and abolished the Danegeld tax, which had seen English kings pay a tax to Danish lords to prevent them from pillaging across England. However, he is best remembered for his association with trying to turn back the tide. It is said that his courtiers flattered him into believing he had the power to make the sea recede. Some say that he then took his throne down to the shore and tried in vain to command the waves, until he nearly drowned. Others suggest that he put on the futile demonstration to show his courtiers he was no fool - and thus put an end to their senseless talk. Canute died in 1035 and was buried in Winchester.","Dr Alexis Kirke covered himself in motion sensors to manipulate wave size .

"A California teen who gained internet fame as 'Instagram's richest kid' is now living the down and out life in jail for committing the lowly act of selling a stolen iPhone online. While 18-year-old Param Sharma's Instagram antics often included him showing off his multiple iPhones, he claims it was someone else's that he listed on Craigslist as a favor which won him a 90-day sentence August 18. As of Thursday, the self-proclaimed rich kid was still behind bars at the Santa Rita jail, apparently unable to cover his $30,000 bond. Got confused? Instagram celebrity Lavish P AKA Param Sharma was convicted last month of selling a stolen iPhone on Craigslist . Hard knocks: The 18-year-old is famous for showing off his apparent wealth in over-the-top staged photos . Police said the phone was stolen. Sharma charged with a misdemeanor crime of failure to make a reasonable effort to find the owner of the phone. Sharma and his attorney Andrew Shalaby claim Sharma was simply selling the phone for a friend who was unable to do it himself. Shalaby also said his client is the first person ever convicted of the obscure charge in the state of California and that the bond set does not match the low-level crime. 'The police knew him and were unhappy with his social media accounts. $30,000 bail is not something that could be done for these charges,' Sharma’s attorney told Buzzfeed.

"Having served in Afghanistan and Iraq, Corporal Mark Rymer was all too used to the tragedy of losing those close to him. But there was one thing it could not prepare him for – the unbearable agony of watching his baby daughter have six heart operations . The experienced soldier said that not knowing if his daughter would survive was scarier than being on the front line. Corporal Mark Rymer and wife Lisa, of Felling Gateshead, said that watching their daughter undergo surgery was like being trapped in a nightmare . Corporal Rymer, 31, and his wife Lisa, from Dishforth, North Yorkshire, were petrified when Lily-Ann was diagnosed with congenital heart disease at five days old. He said: ‘Seeing our little girl in intensive care was awful, we thought she was going to die. ‘Lisa had just given birth and I knew I needed to be strong for both my girls but despite being a “tough soldier” it was hard to keep my emotions together. ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what job role you have, it’s impossible to cope with the utter heartbreak of thinking your child will die. ‘Even being under enemy fire and fearing for my own life has no comparison.’ Thankfully, Lily-Ann battled back from the brink of death to become an active two-year-old who is about to start pre-school. Her parents knew there was something was wrong when she was only an hour old – she was making a strange snoring noise, her lips were blue and her skin was blotchy. Their worst fears were soon confirmed when a scan revealed she had two holes in her heart and her arteries were the wrong way around. Her first heart operation came when she was nine days old, then only five days later she had surgery to reposition her arteries. Corporal Rymer, 31, is now fundraising for the Children's Heart Unit Fund in Newcastle, where Lily-Ann underwent the six heart operations that saved her life . Corporal Rymer said: ‘We feared she wasn’t strong enough to survive. But after nine hours, she pulled through and was stable on the life-support machine.’ She was back on the operating table just days after that to widen a narrowed artery. Corporal Rymer, who is currently stationed in North Yorkshire, said: ‘I’ve been in the Army for 11 years. Despite serving in Afghanistan and Iraq and losing friends through war, nothing compares to the shock and worry of being told your baby has serious heart problems. ‘I was in bits, I’m not normally an emotional person either but I was petrified of losing Lily-Ann.’ His wife added: ‘It was like being trapped in a nightmare, I didn’t stop crying for two weeks.’ Despite her rocky start, Lily-Ann has gone from strength to strength since being born in September 2012. Her latest operation last year, to have an aortic valve replaced, prompted her parents to sign up to be listed as organ donors. Lily-Ann is reviewed by heart specialists every six months and will need further operations as she grows and her heart valves need widening. But her parents are optimistic that she will be able to go on to lead a normal life. Her father added: ‘You’d never know by looking at her that she’s been through the journey she has in the past two years but we are extremely proud of the little fighter we’ve raised.’ Corporal Rymer said: 'It doesn't matter who you are or what job role you have, it's impossible to cope with the utter heart break of thinking your child will die. Even being under enemy fire and fearing for my own life has no comparison' Congenital heart disease is a general term for a range of birth defects that affect the normal workings of the heart. The term congenital means the condition is present at birth. Congenital heart disease is one of the most common types of birth defect, affecting up to 9 in every 1,000 babies born in the UK. Signs and symptoms . The condition can have a number of symptoms, including: . rapid heartbeat . rapid breathing . excessive sweating . extreme tiredness and fatigue . a blue tinge to the skin (cyanosis) tiredness and rapid breathing when a baby is feeding .

"Mr Brightside: Brandon Flowers, singer of The Killers was not always this steady on stage . With a new Christmas single, an appearance on tomorrow’s X Factor Final and their first hits collection, The Killers are marking the tenth anniversary of their debut British gig with their customary swagger. The Las Vegas rockers, fronted by  Brandon Flowers, have sold 22 million albums and headlined at Glastonbury, Wembley and even the White House. But the ride has not always been smooth. Early hits like Mr Brightside were universally lauded, but the band’s second album, 2006’s Sam’s Town, was initially mauled by critics and fans alike — and Brandon was badly stung. ‘I struggled with that response,’ Flowers admits. ‘I had felt compelled to show something of where I come . from — smalltown America — and the Press destroyed me for it. ‘I . made the mistake of believing the bad reviews. They convinced me I was . just a pop tart who didn’t belong in  the realm of serious rock artists. 'Our  following album, Day & Age, was a total reaction to Sam’s . Town.’ The singer . is more philosophical these days. And rightly so. The new retrospective, . Direct Hits, draws material from all four of their studio albums, with . the Bruce Springsteen-esque guitars of the Sam’s Town numbers sitting . seamlessly alongside poppier, synth-powered tracks. ‘I’m . happy we’ve finally released a hits album,’ says the 32-year-old, who . formed The Killers with guitarist Dave Keuning in 2001. ‘I grew up with . “best-of” cassettes. My first Smiths record was Hatful Of Hollow and I . had hits albums by Elton John and The Cars.’ Chatting . ahead of The X Factor Final, which also features Elton, Katy Perry and . One Direction,  Brandon says he is now more at ease with himself than in . the past. On stage: Brandon with his fellow bandmates in The Killers on The Jonathan Ross Show last year . ‘On our first UK tour, I was still wondering whether I was good enough to do this,’ he admits. ‘Our first gig was in a pub, The Dublin Castle in Camden Town, and I was so nervous that I fell offstage during Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine. ‘There had been a lot of hoopla beforehand about us being the  next big thing, so it was very embarrassing.’ The new assurance stems partly from a settled home life in Las Vegas. Since marrying childhood sweetheart Tana Mundkowsky eight years ago, Brandon has become the proud father of three sons. A devout Mormon, he avoids  alcohol and drugs. ‘I used to drink. And smoke. But, as you get older, and have a wife and children, the dynamic starts to change,’ he says. ‘The drinking is fun when it starts, but it doesn’t always end that way. ‘I live a normal life. But I’m always thinking about what I’m going to do next, musically. Do I need a fresh producer? What was Peter Gabriel doing when he was 32?’ Originally influenced by British acts like The Cure and New Order — Brandon was once praised for his ‘genuine fake English accent’ — The Killers have since sought inspiration closer to home, working alongside Lou Reed and Springsteen. Killing it: The Killers have sold 22 million albums and headlined at Glastonbury, Wembley and even the White House . Having collaborated with Reed on Tranquilize, the opening track on the 2007 rarities album Sawdust, Flowers was saddened to hear of the rock pioneer’s death. ‘Spending time with Lou was surreal because of the folklore that surrounds him,’ he says. ‘We were scared to death, but he was sweet, and great to work with. The night he died, we played a show in Las Vegas and sang Pale Blue Eyes in tribute.’ The Springsteen liaison came about at a rock festival in Holland. ‘We were playing Mr Brightside when I saw Bruce really going for it at the side of the stage. That was like some weird dream. He suggested I join him onstage later for Thunder Road, and I jumped at the chance. That song is part of my DNA.’ Beyond the hits CD — and  Christmas In LA, the Killers’ eighth festive charity single — the band will take a breather. Brandon is working on a solo album, but he assures me that he will return to the group when the time is right. ‘This is the end of something,’ he says. ‘Maybe we have become too comfortable. I’ll do my solo stuff and then come back to give The Killers a kick in the pants.’ Direct Hits is out on Island.","Brandon Flowers fell off the stage on his first UK gig in Camden in 2003 .

"Couple: The new Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, (left) has spoken of how his wife Caroline (right) keeps an eye on his drinking . The Archbishop of Canterbury has asked his wife to monitor his drinking, he admitted yesterday. Justin Welby, who is to be enthroned as leader of the Anglican church this week, said his father had been an alcoholic and he feared going down the same road himself. He said he has an agreement with his wife Caroline to tell him if he is drinking too much and that he takes care never to drink alone. Dr Welby disclosed his worries in an interview in which he spoke of his father who was a bootlegger and socialite in the United States before settling in Britain. ‘You never knew what was going to happen,’ Dr Welby said. ‘The experience of living with a parent who had a drink problem is very shaping as to one’s views of what human beings are like.’ He added that his father had engaged in ‘very erratic behaviour, very irrational, dishonesty, shouting. Then, of course, one worries how much of this is how one is going to behave oneself’. Dr Welby said his childhood experience had ‘absolutely not’ made him a teetotaller. ‘I very much enjoy a drink,’ he said. ‘I remember reading that the children of alcoholics have a much better chance themselves of having a dependency problem. ‘So Caroline and I have an agreement that she keeps an eye on me, so she’ll say if I am going over ... but I have rules myself. I don’t drink alone, things like that.’ In a wide-ranging interview in advance of his enthronement at Canterbury on Thursday, the Archbishop said he believed that sex outside marriage was wrong. ‘I have no sense of moral outrage over sexuality in any particular direction,’ he added. ‘I’m far too conscious of my own weaknesses to start hurling rocks at people. ‘My understanding of sexual ethics has been that, regardless of whether it’s gay or straight, sex outside marriage is wrong. Now that gets me into all kinds of difficulty. We don’t have to be obsessive. The trouble is in the Church we get totally hooked on sexual sin. It’s not the thing that most concerns me. Marriage: Justin Welby and his wife Caroline (pictured at Lambeth Palace last November) have five children . ‘People move in together, they have partners, they are not legally married; but there is a profound sense of commitment to each other, which is of intrinsic value.’ The Archbishop said the Government’s same-sex marriage plan, which is being championed by David Cameron, was ‘a bad piece  of legislation’. He distinguished himself from his predecessor Rowan Williams – who frequently suggested that capitalism is a destructive force – by praising the work of banks. The former oil industry chief said: ‘The efficient allocation of capital is a good, enabling companies to grow. ‘One thing I learned over years working in Africa is that the absence of financial services is a severe bad. It is not a good thing at all. It makes human flourishing and wellbeing much harder to achieve, in fact, impossible. ‘But you can do the right thing in such a way it becomes the wrong thing.’ Dr Welby said that had happened in the financial world. He also spoke about the death of his seven-month-old daughter, Johanna, who lived for five days after being flung out of a car in a crash in France in 1983. ‘For me and Caroline, Johanna’s death and the few days after the accident and before she died were the most utter agony,’ he said. ‘Yet at the same time the presence of God was more clearly present than at any time in my life or Caroline’s. It’s a very rare day that I don’t think of Johanna.’","Father-of-four Most Rev Justin Welby admits: 'I very much enjoy a drink'

"Ever wondered what celebrities eat when they're not nibbling on canapes at events or dining at lavish restaurants? Thanks to a new charity cookbook we know exactly what David Cameron cooks for Samantha after a long day in Parliament and just how Russell Brand gets an energy kick in the morning. Estate agent Strutt & Parker has launched a charity cookery book featuring 52 celebrity recipes by high profile actors, singers, chefs, politicians and sports people in aid of Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity. Scroll down for video . Chef Cameron: Thanks to a new charity cookbook, Food With Heart, we know exactly what David Cameron cooks for Samantha behind the doors of Number 10 Downing Street . Highlights of the book, entitled Food with Heart, include David Cameron’s very own Italian pasta dish, which he likes to cook for Samantha and the children at No.10, Simon Cowell’s cottage pie, Gary Lineker’s lasagne and even Russell Brand’s detox ‘green breakfast’ smoothie. Those with a sweeter tooth can choose between an array of superstar desserts including Elizabeth Hurley’s decadent chocolate mousse, Amanda Holden’s shortbread and Jack Whitehall’s bread and butter pudding. Inside, the recipes have been brought to life with drawings by distinctive illustrator Louise Morgan, well known for her instantly-recognisable work for Waitrose. Skills: David, who can be seen cooking up a storm with President Obama, loves to cook Italian pasta with red wine and lots of double cream . It seems that the Prime Minister has taken inspiration from the River Cafe - his pasta dish, which is crammed with spicy Italian sausage, red wine and double cream, is a shortened adapted version of the London restaurant. Tony Blair's baba ghanouj recipe was inspired by his travels to the Middle East and he says that he 'loves' the dish and has it 'all the time' when he's visiting. Funny man Jack Whitehall has shared his hot cross bun/pannettone bread and butter pudding recipe and said: 'This won me Comic Relief Masterchef. I was up against Micky Flanagan, who cooked a fish and orange dish, so it wasn't the best competition.' Russell Brand's super clean green smoothie recipe is full of apples, pineapple, ginger, cucumber, spinach, celery and chard, while Emma Bunton's 'delicious squidgy chocolate cake' is a little less virtuous.

"For a certain generation, Kabaddi was a typical feature on Trans World Sport, but now the niche sport is set for the big time under the lights at the 02 Arena. The newly formed World Kabaddi League launches in London this weekend and aims to drag the sport into the 21st century and the mainstream. Set for the big time: Kabaddi will begin a new world league to open up at London's 02 Arena this weekend . Big Asia appeal: India and Pakistan compete in the men's World Cup final last year, held in Punjab . Going global: Kabaddi players compete in India but the sport's new league hopes to appeal around the world . Kabaddi is a blend of rugby without the ball, tag for grown ups, with wrestling thrown in. It contains a mixture of tactical brainpower and beastly brawn. The teams take turns sending a 'raider' into the other half. To win a point, the raider must take a breath, run into the opposing half, tag one or more members of the opposite team, then return to his home half before inhaling again. The raider will chant 'kabaddi, kabaddi' with his exhaling breath to show the referee he has not inhaled. The raider will be declared 'out' and will not gain the point if he inhales before returning to his side, or returns without touching an opponent. The tagged defenders will be 'out' if they do not succeed in catching the raider who tagged them. Defenders may not cross the centre line (the 'lobby') of the field and the raider may not cross the boundary lines. However, there is one bonus line which can grant extra points for the raider if he manages to touch it and return successfully. Players who are out are temporarily sent off the field. Each time a player is out, the opposing team earns a point. A team scores a bonus of two points (called a 'lona'), if the entire opposing team is declared out. At the end of the game, the team with the most points wins. It has a following of 100 million around the world mainly in South Asia and within the Asian diaspora. While the sport is big in India it has been played 'underground' around the rest of the world. But the WKL seeks to change that this year as eight newly formed super teams compete in 14 cities in five countries over the next five months after which one of the sides will be crowned the first ever world Kabaddi champions. The WKL begins on Saturday and Sunday at the 02 Arena and will be supported by  singers and dancers from Bollywood, including Akshay Kumar who co-owns one of the teams in London's Khalsa Warriors. WKL has received enthusiastic backing from Labour MP for Ealing Southall Virendra Sharma said: 'I played it as younger man. It’s a great game which in England is already being played by the white communities as well as being very big amongst Asians. 'It’s popular with women too. 'The formation of WKL can see the sport grow and I hope come the next Commonwealth Games it will be included and further down the line be recognised as an Olympic sport too.' British based business man Talwinder Hayre, co owner of the Birmingham side, United Singhs added: 'I am confident that the formation of WKL will see Kabaddi take off. 'In five years our aim is for the sport to be up there with IPL cricket in terms of its popularity.' After this weekend the WKL road show travels to Birmingham before moving onto New York and beyond.

"Advertising magnate Lord Maurice Saatchi has spoken of the unbearable grief of losing his wife to cancer and how he visits her tomb each morning to have breakfast with her. The 66-year-old says Josephine Hart’s death has been so painful for him that he still sets a place out for her during meal times. And in the morning he arranges the papers in the order in which the bestselling author liked to read them. Tragic: Lord Maurice Saatchi with his late wife Josephine Hart in 2005, six years before she died of cancer . Lord Saatchi in 1991 and his late wife Josephine Hart, in 1989. The pair married in 1984 when Hart was 37 . Hart, an Irish-born writer and poet, died from ovarian cancer in June last year, after keeping her health problems a secret for two years. Saatchi told the Sunday Times: ‘I’ve never experienced grief before; this is an incomparable nightmare.’ Every morning when he is staying at their home in West Sussex, he drives to his wife’s tomb, marked J&M, at the end of the lake and eats a grapefruit cocktail. At meal times the Tory peer behaves as if she were still there. He said: ‘I have thought, that this is close to madness.’ But in the moving interview, he rejected the idea that those suffering from bereavement need to move on. He added: ‘In my view, to move on is a monstrous act of betrayal and to come to terms with – I think I’d call that an act of selfishness.’ Tragically, he admitted to the newspaper he has thought of suicide 'continuously' since her death. Millionaire Lord Saatchi, who made his fortune with his brother Charles in Saatchi & Saatchi, the advertising agency, was four years her junior and Hart's second husband. They pair began an affair while they worked at the publishers Haymarket and married shortly after in 1984 . Saatchi, right, sees it as his role to continue his late wife's work and foundation . They began an affair while they worked at the publishers Haymarket and married shortly after in 1984, when she was 37. They had a son together, Edward, who is now in his late 20s. Hart’s 1991 debut novel, Damage, sold more than one million copies, was translated into 27  languages and made into a film starring Jeremy Irons. She also produced a number of West End plays. Her other novels include Sin, Oblivion, The Stillest Day and The Reconstructionist. She had a troubled upbringing after losing her brother Charles at the age of six and her younger sister, Sheila shortly after. Within eight months brother Owen was killed in an accident. In the decade before her death she made poetry fashionable with popular readings at the British Library. A collection of her critical introductions to 19 poets and a few of their poems, entitled Life Saving: Why We Need Poetry, was published last Thursday. After her death Saatchi launched The Poetry App, created by the Josephine Hart Poetry Foundation, which features classic poems read by actors. Saatchi is half of the most famous advertising partnership in history. He now runs M&C Saatchi with his brother after being ousted from the original company. He sees it as his role to continue Hart's work and foundation and is devoted to ensuring his wife's legacy lives on.","Advertising magnate says he still sets a meal place out for his late wife .

"As interplanetary exploration goes, it could be a first. Not content with sending rovers to Mars, scientists have revealed an ambitious plan to send a boat to Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Engineers who unveiled their proposal at the European Planetary Science Congress today with a selection of potential craft powered by wheels, paddles and even a screw. Saturn and its largest moon, Titan. Researchers hope to send a boat to the liquid gas lakes on the moon's surface. Titan is one of the most Earth-like bodies in the Solar System. With . a thick atmosphere, a diameter between that of Earth and the planet . Mercury, and a network of seas, lakes and rivers, it is in many respects . more like a planet than a moon like the Earth’s. The Cassini-Huygens mission, which studied Titan extensively in the 2000s, confirmed that lakes, seas and rivers of liquid hydrocarbons (similar to household gas) exist, covering much of the satellite’s northern hemisphere. Although it eventually landed on solid ground, the Hugyens lander was designed to be able to float for a short period. The new plans, called the Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer, proposes a boat-probe, propelled by wheels, paddles or screws. The probe would land in the middle of Ligeia Mare (the biggest lake, near Titan’s north pole), then set sail for the coast, taking scientific measurements along the way. The mission would last around six months to a year. Ligeia Mar (left) captured by Cassini, compared to Lake Superior (on the right). The sea on Titan is believed to be 100,000 square kilometers, larger than Lake Superior (82,000 square kilometers). 'The main innovation in TALISE is the propulsion system,' said Igone Urdampilleta (SENER), a member of the team developing the idea. 'This allows the probe to move, under control, from the landing site in the lake, to the closest shore. 'The displacement capability would achieve the obtaining of liquid and solid samples from several scientific interesting locations on Titan's surface such as the landing place, along the route towards the shore and finally at the shoreline.'

Researchers believe Titan's environment is too cold for life as we know it, but its environment, rich in the building blocks of life, is of great interest to astrobiologists. The satellite's atmosphere is made up largely of nitrogen (like Earth’s), and is rich in organic compounds and hydrogen cyanide, which may have played a role in the emergence of life on Earth. The TALISE concept is being developed as a partnership between SENER, a private engineering and technology group, and the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid, Spain. This rendering of the proposed TALISE probe shows one possible means of propulsion: screws on either side of the probe. A prototype using wheels is also being developed. A third version using paddles is being considered by the team.","Plans would send a craft sailing through Titan's seas, lakes and rivers of liquid gas .

"An aspiring model has been scarred for life by a dentist’s drill that overheated and burned through her lip. Jade Blinco, 24, says she now looks ‘like a monster’ after the hospital operation to remove two wisdom teeth went horribly wrong. NHS bosses have admitted the injury could have been prevented and are negotiating an out-of-court settlement. Scroll down for video . Jade Blinco, 24, from Bilston in the West Midlands, was left permanently scarred when a dentist's drill overheated and melted her lip . The 24-year-old, pictured before the incident, had her wisdom teeth removed at Birmingham City Hospital. She said: 'I've always had a fear of dentists. But I never expected something like this could happen' Yesterday Miss Blinco, from Bilston, West Midlands, said: ‘The last three years have been horrendous as I have tried to come to terms with living with the horrific injury and scar I have been left with. ‘I’ve always had a fear of dentists. I was scared of needles and sitting in the dentist’s chair. But I never expected something like this.’ Describing what happened at Birmingham City Hospital on September 1, 2011, she said: ‘The dentist explained what was going to happen and gave me a contract to read through and sign before the procedure. ‘They were putting me under general anaesthetic so he mentioned that. As soon as I woke up I felt excruciating pain. ‘No one told me what had happened, they gave me two doses of morphine and sent me back to sleep. No one noticed in the operating theatre. I never imagined for one minute that I would wake from surgery to be told I had a serious painful burn that has scarred me for life. ‘I just felt ugly, being a model I took a lot of pictures of myself and took care over my appearance, and suddenly I looked a monster. ‘I’ve been told I may need plastic surgery to try and improve the appearance of my lip but it’s likely I will never look the same as before.’ Miss Blinco quit her job as a nursery worker because her scar was scaring the children. Miss Blinco, pictured (left) before the incident, claims her hopes of becoming a model have now been dashed because of the permanent scar on her lip (right) The 24-year-old, pictured with the scar she is left with, claims she was forced to leave her job as a nursery nurse because the children were so scared of her scar . Miss Blinco said the scar, which she calls 'disgusting', changes throughout the year and often peels . She said: ‘When I went back to the nursery to hand in my sick note, the kids were horrified by what had happened to me. ‘They looked really distressed and scared. I walked out in tears and knew then, for definite, that I couldn’t go back. ‘And no modelling agencies will take me any more with this scar.’ Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust has admitted full liability and Miss Blinco is in line for a payout. A spokesman for the NHS Trust said: ‘We are very sorry for the distress experienced by Miss Blinco. 'We apologised immediately after the incident in person and subsequently in writing to her. 'On the day of surgery an apology was given to Miss Blinco by the senior surgeon which was reiterated the following day in the presence of family members. 'Our chief executive has also written to apologise to Miss Blinco earlier this year. 'Since the incident we have changed all of our hand pieces ensuring that this issue will not occur again.’ Charlotte Cook, a medical expert for solicitors Irwin Mitchell who represented her, said: 'Jade suffered a serious injury that has left her permanently scarred and has had a huge impact on her life and future. 'One of the most concerning elements of what happened is that the Trust's investigation highlighted that it was aware the drill tool was prone to overheating after a previous instance of a patient suffering a lip burn. 'Jade's injuries were totally unnecessary and could easily have been prevented.' The NHS Trust admitted the injury could have been prevented and are negotiating an out-of-court settlement .","Jade Blinco, 24, went into hospital to have her wisdom teeth removed .

Naked ambition: A group of Malaysian nudists involved in a naked sports event are now under investigation by authorities .

"Guilty: Reston Zoo Director Meghan Mogensen, 26, was sentenced to 30 days in jail for animal cruelty and llegal possession of animal anaesthesia . A Virginia zoo director has been found guilty of animal cruelty after drowning an injured wallaby in a bucket of water. Reston Zoo Director Meghan Mogensen, 26, was sentenced to 30 days in jail on Friday after the body of the adult wallaby named Parmesan was recovered soaking in a plastic bag last January by a now former employee. That former zoo curator turned whistleblower, Ashley Rood, testified that the wallaby's death was just the tip of inhumane killings undertaken by the director that included rabbits slammed into walls, chickens fed to pythons and others plainly shot. It was an eye injury sustained by Parmesan while hopping around its pen on January 26th that led to its barbaric death and disposal at the hands of the director, according to Rood. ‘I ripped open the bag and I saw the animal and it solidified it for me,' Rood described to ABC7 of finding the wallaby’s body soaking in one of the park’s dumpsters. From what started as a bandage on Parmesan's left eye and his placement by zookeepers in a plastic crate for his recovery, Rood said the animal managed to bang his head, further puncturing his eye which started bleeding. According to Rood, Ashley Mogensen asked the zoo's owner, Eric Mogensen, what to do. He told her to euthanize the animal, a decision that 'dumbfounded' Rood who believed its injuries could be treated. 'I didn't think the eye could be salvaged but it could be removed by a vet,' Rood said, according to the Vienna Patch. 'I told [Ashley Mogensen] other than that, he appears perfectly fine.' Scroll down for video . Killed: The wallaby named Parmesan, pictured, was recovered wrapped inside a garbage bag with tests finding neither sign of a needle's injection or a drug in the animal's body . Rood claimed Mogensen retorted with: 'These animals are Eric’s property, and we need to do what he wants with them.' Mogensen, according to Rood, said she'd 'take care of it' and sent her on an errand after she expressed not wanting anything to do with its euthanasia. Returning to find the wallaby missing from its enclosure and a bucket of water one-quarter of the way full sitting nearby, Rood said she put two and two together and raced to a dumpster to find the animal soaking wet while wrapped inside a trash bag. Rood immediately announced her resignation and called local authorities. 'I told Meghan ""I think you and your father are sick, sadistic people and I am not going to be a part of it anymore,"" said Rood. 'It is one thing to euthanize them. It is another thing to drown them.' Appealing: Morgensen, seen holding a baby kangaroo in 2011, plans to appeal the guilty verdict . Injury: Parmesan had suffered an eye injury while hopping around its pen, one that the zoo's curator believed could be treated instead of being killed . Responding authorities who saw the animal's body were told that Mogensen had just washed the wallaby -reasoning its wet condition - after humanely euthanizing it with an IV injection of Beuthanasia-D. They turned critical when seeing the zoo didn't have permits or training to legally administer the drug. Ordering a necropsy and toxicology test on the body, expert witnesses also reported finding neither sign of a needle's injection or a drug in the animal's body. Instead there were ruptured blood vessels in its lungs along with plant matter and bacteria consistent with a drowning, according to Jaime Weisman, veterinary  diagnostician with the Virginia Department of Agriculture who was one of 15 witnesses who testified on behalf of prosecutors. Mogensen has been sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $1,000 for the animal cruelty charge along with a $250 fine and six month suspensions of her driver’s license for illegal possession of animal anaesthetics. Whistleblower: That curator Ashley Rood, pictured, said she called authorities who recovered the body which the director said was humanely killed and only wet because of a bath . String of abuse: The curator claims that the wallaby's death was the breaking point for her after previous animal killings at the zoo allegedly involved banging rabbits against walls and shooting them . Asked by the judge if she had anything to say before her verdict’s reading, Mogensen did not speak, in addition to not testifying during the trial. 'I don't wish anything bad for the zoo, there are so many animals there that I love and there are people who work there that do really love what they do and I know it's hard for them right now,' Rood told WUSA after the trial whose verdict she described being a major relief to her. Meghan Mogensen is said by her attorneys to be appealing the charges against her. ‘She was concerned about this animal,’ Defence Attorney Caleb Kershner said in his closing statement according to the Washington Post. ‘It was suffering.’ Other zoos owned by Eric Mogensen have been scrutinized in recent years while this was the first against the Reston Zoo, according to the Post which also lists the current allegations of additional inhumane animal killings within the zoo according to Rood. A request for comment by the Reston Zoo was not immediately returned on Saturday.

"TV debates between the party leaders will be scrapped by David Cameron, the UK Independence Party claimed today. UKIP believe the Tories will try to pull the plug on the live debates in 2015 to prevent the Prime Minister having to go head to head with Nigel Farage. After making gains in local and European elections, UKIP believes it would be impossible for the debates to go ahead without them. UKIP strategists believe Nigel Farage would have a strong claim to taking part in the debates after strong election success, an idea they beleive David Cameron will jettison . UKIP have heaped pressure on the Tories, winning dozens of county council seats and picking up a quarter of the popular vote. Many senior Tories blame the debates in 2010 for Mr Cameron's failure to secure an outright majority. He performed badly in the first encounter, while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg benefited from being comparatively unknown. Conservative strategists fear Mr Farage could enjoy a similar boost in the polls if he was given a platform in the debates. ""There will not be any television debates in 2015 because David Cameron refuses to debate with Nigel Farage,' a UKIP source told The Guardian, . 'If we win the European elections next year it will be completely unjustified not to have us in the debates. Therefore they will not happen. 'It is impossible just to have David Cameron and Ed Miliband in the debates. If you have Nick Clegg you have to have Nigel. Therefore there will be no debates.' Block: Ed Miliband, left, wants to prevent UKIP's Nigel Farage, right, from joining leaders of the main three political parties in the election TV debates . The warning comes after it was suggested Labour leader Ed Miliband also wants to . block the UKIP from having a role in the debates . Labour had thought UKIP would only damage the Tories' election hopes. But strategists now fear UKIP's 'brand of anti-politics could damage all three main parties in unpredictable ways,' The Guardian reported. Mr Clegg enjoyed a surge in the polls in the 2010 polls as a relatively unknown figure alongside Mr Cameron and Gordon Brown. Spotlight: Labour has joined the Tories in blocking UKIP leader Nigel Farage from the leader's debates held in the build up to the General Election . Until recently Labour had hoped to . capitalise on the rise of UKIP, hoping it would split the centre-right . vote and allow them to clinch crucial swing seats. But recent polls suggest UKIP has taken support from all the main parties. A source close to Ed Miliband insisted no final decision had been made on UKIP's involvement. 'We've got to get David Cameron to agree to it first. Without him there will be no debates, then we'll worry about keeping Farage out.' In the Eastleigh by-election UKIP came second pushing the Tories into an embarrassing second. A . poll by former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft found UKIP attracted the . support of 22 per cent of people who voted Tory in 2010, 19 per cent of .

It was the first time in their history that Wigan had reached the final and their triumph matched Wimbledon’s unlikely victory over Liverpool in 1988.

Silverware: Emmerson Boyce and Gary Caldwell lift the FA Cup after Wigan's dramatic success . Glorious: Wigan celebrate their win on the Wembley pitch . Wigan chairman Dave Whelan, who broke his leg playing for Blackburn Rovers in the 1960 final,  said: ‘Fantastic! I had the  dream but I didn’t publish it. I thought we would get to the final and win 1-0 and it is repayment for me breaking my leg.’ Manager Roberto Martinez described Manchester City as a brilliant side but said: ‘We didn’t win by luck – from start to finish it was an incredible performance.’ Wigan are currently facing relegation from the Premier League, but those troubles seemed to be temporarily forgotten as the players and fans celebrated beating last season’s Premier League champions and the richest club in the . world, backed by the oil dollars of Abu Dhabi. The Latics had never gone beyond the quarter-finals of the competition before this season but a remarkable story ended in perfect fashion when the injury-time winner proved to be enough. Whelan bought Wigan 18 years ago when the club were in the bottom tier of the Football League and struggling to attract crowds of 2,000. Today's 1-0 victory earned his club the first major trophy of their 81-year history. Whelan said: 'We played so well. Manchester City are a quality side. I thought we were miles the better team. We should have had a penalty just before half-time. We had more chances and we played them off the park. Hands on the prize: Match winner Watson and Martinez lift the FA Cup .

There will be no celebrating just yet for the Latics, though, with their Premier League future still very much in the balance.

"Scientists have discovered that nature created mechanical gears long before man made cars and bikes - in the legs of a tiny jumping insect. The baby Issus bug, a plant hopping garden dweller, has curved cog-like strips of teeth on each hind leg which interlock and rotate like mechanical gears to help it jump. The discovery proves that gear mechanisms previously thought to be a solely man made invention were in fact first created by nature. The baby Issus' rear legs has curved cog-like strips of opposing teeth hat intermesh, rotating like mechanical gears . Scientists at Cambridge University made the discovery using a combination of body structure analysis and high-speed video. ‘We usually think of gears as something that we see in human designed machinery, but we’ve found that that is only because we didn’t look hard enough,’ said Zoologist and paper author Gregory Sutton. ‘These gears are not designed; they are evolved - representing high speed and precision machinery evolved for synchronisation in the animal world.’ Each gear on the Issus¿ leg is around 400 micrometres long, and there are between ten and 12 teeth on each leg . The gears on the opposing hind legs lock together like those in in car gear box to make sure the legs are completely synchronised when they move . The Issus Coleoptratus is fairly common in England, especially in the southeast, but rarer in Scotland and Wales. It is found on a range of woody plants, including most common deciduous trees. The baby Issus bug, a plant hopping . garden dweller, has curved cog-like strips of teeth on each hind leg . which interlock and rotate like mechanical gears to help it jump. The insects legs always move within 30 microseconds of each other, with one microsecond equal to a millionth of a second. The mechanical gears are only found in the juvenile insect, and are lost when the bug grows into its adult phase. Each gear tooth on the insect’s legs has a rounded corner at the point it connects with the other gears to stop teeth from shearing off when they clash, similar to gears on a bike. The gears on the opposing hind legs lock together like those in in car gear box to make sure the legs are completely synchronised when they move. This is critical for powerful jumps as even a tiny discrepancy in the timing between the legs would see, the little Issus spin out of control. The legs always move within 30 microseconds of each other, with one microsecond equal to a millionth of a second. ‘This precise synchronisation would be impossible to achieve through a nervous system, as neural impulses would take far too long for the extraordinarily tight coordination required,’ said lead author Professor Malcolm Burrows. ‘By developing mechanical gears, the . Issus can just send nerve signals to its muscles to produce  roughly the . same amount of force - then if one leg starts to propel the jump the . gears will interlock, creating absolute synchronicity. The mechanical gears are only found in the juvenile insect, and are lost when the bug grows into its adult phase . The legs always move within 30 microseconds of each other, with one microsecond equal to a millionth of a second . ‘In Issus, the skeleton is used to solve a complex problem that the brain and nervous system can’t. ‘This emphasises the importance of considering the properties of the skeleton in how movement is produced.’ The mechanical gears are only found in the juvenile insect, and are lost when the bug grows into its adult phase. It is not yet known why this happens, but scientists think it could be because if one tooth on the gear breaks, the whole mechanism is damaged, and while juveniles can self-repair, any damage in adulthood is permanent. Each gear on the Issus’ leg is around 400 micrometres long, and there are between ten and 12 teeth on each leg. Unlike man-made gears, each gear tooth is asymmetrical and curved towards the point where the cogs interlock. This is because man-made gears need a symmetric shape to work in both rotational directions, whereas the Issus gears are only powering one way to launch the animal forward. While there are examples of cogs in the animal kingdom, such as on the shell of a turtle, gears with a functioning role have never been found until now. The findings are reported in the latest issue of the journal Science.","The baby Issus bug has curved cog-like strips of teeth on each hind leg .
These cogs can interlock and rotate like mechanical gears to help it jump .
This is the first time that mechanical gears similar have been found in nature ."
"There was nothing Dr Antony Kidman loved more than to spend time with his adoring family. The father of Nicole and Antonia Kidman and grandfather of ten – will now be remembered for how he was always there to support his family with his wisdom, kindness and a big smile. The family is currently in deep shock after the clinical psychologist tragically died on Friday in Singapore, where he was visiting daughter Antonia and her family. Scroll down for video . Daddy's girl: Nicole Kidman kissed her happy father Antony Kidman on the red carpet at the Swisse Celebrate Life Ball in Melbourne, in June . The visit was typical of the doting father, who would regularly be pictured with his daughters and their children. Despite being in his seventies Antony was still happy to travel to wherever his children needed him and on this occasion had been spending time with Antonia, who lives in Singapore with her husband Craig Marran and her six children. It had been a very special start to the year for the Kidman family as Antony and Janelle celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. As an indication of how close they all are to each other, the busy family all came to Sydney from various parts of the world in January to toast the special occasion and this is reportedly the last time they were seen all together. Family affair: Nicole was joined by her parents, Antony and Janelle at the 59th Golden Globes Awards in 2002 . Tragic: Antony died on Friday following a fall at his Singapore Hotel room . But the last pictures of Nicole seen publicly with Antony were at the Swisse Celebrate Life Ball in Melbourne, in June this year, when the actress beamed as she walked the red carpet with her two favourite men – her father and husband Keith Urban. The Hollywood star giggled as she spoke to press whilst pulling her dad close and even broke off from her interview to make a special mention about her dad. ‘Here’s my dad,’ she laughed. ‘I’ve got my men here with me tonight.’ Family album: Antonia, Janelle, Antony and Nicole all posed for this picture in 1990 . Big smiles: The girls gathered around their dad as they enjoyed a special moment with their father . Antony stood quietly listening to Nicole answer questions, smiley widely and looking incredibly proud of his film star daughter. Daddy’s girl Nicole would regularly take her father along with her to glitzy red carpet events. He was always happy to take regularly breaks from his schedule to accompany her to important landmark occasions like the Oscars in 2003 - when she won Best Actress in a Leading Role for The Hours. Always happy to talk about Antony, Nicole had previously described him as a brilliant dad. Happy times: Father of the bride Antony couldn't have looked prouder as he joined Nicole when she married Keith Urban in 2006 . Memories: Wherever they went Antony would always be beaming with happiness and he helped calm Nicole nerves with his laughter on her wedding day in Sydney . She said: ‘He's a great father, I can call him at three in the morning and he's there for me. The beauty added that he always supported her career decisions: 'By the time I was a teenager, I had developed skills as a writer, and my father encouraged me to think about a career in journalism.' A psychologist and Director of the Health Psychology Unit at Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital Antony, who was awarded an Order of Australia in 2005 for his contributions to clinical psychology, clearly instilled a hardworking ethic into his daughters. She also talked about the way she was brought up adding: ‘My father always used the phrase when we were growing up: 'With love, but firm'. Big night: Nicole's parents both accompanied her to the Oscars in 2003, when she won the Best Actress in a Leading Role for The Hours . Long happy marriage: The family all came together in Sydney in January to celebrate Antony and Janelle's 50th wedding anniversay . 'Believe me, I grew up with all the rules and guidelines and boundaries. 'My sister and I were only allowed to watch half an hour of television a day! My parents were always extremely supportive. They allowed me any artistic outlet I wanted.' She would also often make anecdotal references about him and his cooking skills while she was at school. 'All the other mums would make these beautiful little sandwiches, but my daddy would just put a slab of butter on top of the bread and then say: 'Whatddaya want-peanut butter?' Helping out: Antony, pictured here with Sunday Rose in 2010, would regularly help Nicole and Antonia by looking after their children . 'Wouldn't cut it and would't wrap it properly, so by the time you opened it at school it was all stale, and all the kids would tease us.' Nicole made mention of how active her father was, recalling: 'He ran eight miles at lunchtime, and I used to get terribly embarrassed when the kids at school saw him running, as he'd be all sweaty and look like hell. 'He has brought me up to believe in certain issues, definite values. Catching up for lunch: Antony, Janelle, Antonia and her daughter Lucia would regularly spend time together . 'He encouraged me to find time off by myself to meditate every day. He swears by that.' Just like he was always present for Antonia and Nicole when they were little girls, Antony was also there for them in their adult life. Both daughters split from their first husbands - Nicole divorced Tom Cruise in 2001 while Antonia also separated from her first husband Angus Hawley in 2007. It always appeared through pictures taken of him with his girls that he was a stable constant in their lives.","Famous family mourns the tragic loss of Antony Kidman .

"There used to be an unremarkable gravestone in a garden in Windsor etched with the line 'Here lies Joy' - but behind that simple sentence is a truly remarkable story that stretches back to the early 20th century and across hundreds of miles to Russia. The grave was the final resting place not of a human, but a spaniel – who belonged to the son of Russia’s last monarch, Tsar Nikolai II Romanov. He was executed in Ipatiev House, along with his wife, Empress Alexandra, five children and four servants by revolutionary communist forces on 17 July 1918 in Yekaterinburg. How Joy came to be buried in England, in the shadow of Windsor Castle, is a story that’s not even very well known among Russian historians. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Crown Prince Alexei with Joy, whose fate remained a mystery for many years . Joy was much-loved by Alexei, who was killed at the age of 13 by Bolshevik forces . Joy was a constant companion to Tsar Nikolai’s son, 13-year-old Crown Prince Alexei, and it was thought for a long time that he was shot dead by a Bolshevik execution squad that wanted no trace of the Romanov family left, as they were perceived to have been responsible for many of Russia’s problems at the time. However, it turns out that while two other dogs the royal family owned were shot dead, one of the soldiers in the execution squad took pity on Joy and allowed him to live. The soldiers had to retreat, but on their return to the house eight days later found Joy running around the yard in a malnourished state, according to The Siberian Times. Royal dog: Tsar Nikolai II with Joy . Joy was eventually homed with Colonel Pavel (Paul) Rodzianko, who was serviing with the British Expeditionary Force in Siberia, according to the paper. The British were expelled from Russia by the Bolsheviks and Rodzianko had grown so fond of Joy that he took him back to England. He wrote in his book Tattered Banners: ‘With heavy hearts we sailed away from Vladivostok. Joy, the little ill-named spaniel who had seen his master murdered, that fateful night, travelled with me. I have never seen Russia again.' Joy was given a home somewhere on Clewer Hill Road in Windsor, where he saw out the rest of his days in comfort. It's thought that the garden has now made way for a car park. How Joy escaped from Russia to Windsor . Joy was buried in Sefton Lawn, Windsor, having escaped hundreds of miles from Russia .

"People with the rare AB blood group are more likely to develop memory loss, a study has found. U.S. researchers found that people with the rare bloody type were 82 per cent more likely to develop thinking and memory problems that can lead to dementia, than  people with other blood types. The new study comes on the back of past research which suggests  people with blood type O have a lower risk of heart disease and stroke, thus decreasing the risk of memory loss and dementia. Researchers analysed a group of people, aged 45 and above, for an average of more than three years. U.S. researchers found that people with rare blood group AB were 82 per cent more likely to develop the thinking and memory problems that can lead to dementia, than people with other blood types . They identified 495 participants who developed thinking and memory problems or cognitive impairment, during the study. They were compared with 687 people with no cognitive problems. People with AB blood type made up six per cent of those who developed cognitive impairment - higher than the four per cent of the general population with the blood group. Author Dr Mary Cushman, of the University of Vermont College of Medicine, said the new study supports the idea that having a certain blood group may give a lower risk for heart disease and stroke, which in turn protects the brain. She said: 'Our study looks at blood type and risk of cognitive impairment, but several studies have shown that factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes increase the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. 'Blood type is also related to other vascular conditions like stroke, so the findings highlight the connections between vascular issues and brain health.' Researchers said the study supports previous research which suggests having a certain blood group, like O, gives a lower risk for heart disease and stroke, which in turn protects the brain . She added: 'More research is needed to confirm these results.' Researchers also looked at blood levels of factor VIII, a protein that helps blood to clot. High levels of factor VIII are related to higher risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. People in this study with higher levels of factor VIII in their blood were 24 per cent more likely to develop thinking and memory problems than people with lower levels of the protein. People with AB blood had a higher average level of factor VIII than people with other blood types.","Study found that people with rare blood type AB were 82% more likely to develop memory loss than people with other blood types .

"Rescuers searching a Himalayan river for dozens of Indian students, who were swept away when a dam released a rush of water, have retrieved four bodies. The 25 students from the southern city of Hyderabad had been taking photographs on the banks of the Beas River on Sunday when they were engulfed by the water from the Larji hydropower station near the mountain resort town of Manali in Himachal Pradesh. They had been on a 10-day field trip with around 48 students, some of whom managed to scramble to safety. Scroll down for video .

'We saw a wall of water hit those who were on the banks. They fell flat and disappeared under the waves,' a student identified only as Sumiran told The Indian Express newspaper. Kiran Kumar, a professor who was accompanying the students, said he saw the water level rising and told the students to step back from the bank. But 'within one or two seconds, the water level increased all of a sudden. Some of the students were washed away right in front of me,' he told the the Associated Press. Police in Manali said four bodies were recovered Monday morning after the search resumed at dawn. They said a shortage of boats and divers was hampering the operation.

"A retired nurse has made a 7,000 mile pilgrimage from Canada to England for the last five years just to visit a tree. Val Theroux, 64, is so infatuated with the oak she even found it on Google Earth so she could see it from abroad. The mother-of-two flies over just to see the tree and gets up early in the morning so she can be alone with it. Trunk 'a Trunk 'a burnin' love: Val  with her beloved oak tree that she flys from Canada every year to visit . Don't ever leaf me: Val in the shadow of her one true love . During her visits to the oak, in Brockenhurst, in the New Forest, Hampshire, she hugs it and stands with her back against it. Her husband of 40 years, John, 63, jokes that it is her 'tree lover' and used to join her for the visits but now prefers to stay at home. Val said she discovered the oak, which is at a popular spot for picnic makers and has a rope for children to swing from, in 2005 while visiting her daughter. She said: 'When I first walked in the New Forest I felt that I was home in a way that I never had before. 'I came back the next year with my husband and I've been drawn back to the forest ever since. 'As soon as I walked around the corner and glimpsed my special tree I felt connected to it. 'I think all trees have an energy, like people. But some people are good friends and some are soul mates, that's what this tree is to me. 'I know it like a person. It's like you see a house that appeals to you and you'd remember that. 'I first thought of this tree as a teenager but its character has matured a lot over the last 12 months.' Nuts about you: Val's beloved acorn tree in all its glory . Val Theroux is just one of many people around the world who feel an emotional and often romantic desire towards inanimate objects. In March, British citizen Amanda Whittaker spoke of her attraction to the Statue of Liberty, saying:  'She is my long-distance lover and I am blown away by how stunning she is. Other people might be shocked to think I can have romantic feelings for an object, but I am not the same as them.' In 2007 Robert Stewart, 51, admitted a sexually aggravated breach of the peace after stripping off and simulating sex with a bicycle in Scotland. Mr Stewart was caught by cleaners in his bedroom at hostel in Ayr. The court heard: ‘They used a master key to unlock the door and they then observed the accused wearing only a white t-shirt, naked from the waist down. The accused was holding the bike and moving his hips back and forth as if to simulate sex.’ For some, close emotional relationships with humans are incomprehensible. Val, from Kamloops, in British Columbia, has flown to the tree once each year since discovering it in 2008, costing around £4,000. She believes trees hold a lot of wisdom because they have been around for so long and says she is able to tune into her tree's perspective of the world when she is home in Canada. Val added: 'Some trees will not give you the time of day, while others are very welcoming. 'I come over specifically just to see it. If I'm here for a week I will see it most days and spend a few hours with it. 'I've been very happily married for 40 years but my husband and I joke that I come back to see my tree lover. I get a lot of healing from this tree and go away feeling like I've seen an old friend.' Val, who is currently in the UK visiting her tree, says she will continue to make her annual pilgrimage as long as she can afford to. She said: 'I love my husband dearly, I would never look sideways at another man, except this tree. 'My husband is quite used to me and he doesn't necessarily want to come and visit the same place again, so I come on my own.'","'Some trees will not give you the time of day', but this one is her 'soulmate' says besotted Val Theroux, 64 .

"He is being called ‘The Third Winkelvoss’. A man is suing the founders of photo sharing app Snapchat because he claims that they stole the idea from him. Frank Reginald Brown says in his lawsuit that he came up with the concept whilst working on it with Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy when they were students at Stanford. He alleges that things suddenly turned sour so they changed the passwords to the servers and shut him out. Stolen: Frank Reginald Brown IV, seen left, has filed a lawsuit against company Snapchat as well as its co-founders Bobby Murphy and Evan Spiegel, seen right, alleging they stole his idea for the program . Value: Analysts have valued the company that uses this ghost as its logo at $800 million . Brown was then horrified when he saw Snapchat become a huge hit with 60million pictures now being shared every day via the service. Analysts have valued the company at between $60million and $70million. Brown’s claims echo those of twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who say that Mark Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook from them whilst they were all at Harvard. They were given $65million in a settlement but spent four years trying in vain to get more, with their story being dramatised in the film The Social Network which was about the birth of Facebook. Snapchat lets users send photos to each other which will then be deleted after a certain period of time, typically 10 seconds. It lets people send embarrassing pictures without the worry they will be saved forever. Happier times: In September Snapchat celebrated their one-year anniversary and so had a new cake but Frank Reginald Brown was visibly not around to share it . New team: The Snapchat team posted a picture of themselves in Norway last fall, left, as well as one of the team members playing with their app, right, five months before the lawsuit was filed against them . Brown, 23, alleges that he came up with the concept before going to Spiegel, who called it a ‘million-dollar idea’. They supposedly agreed to work together and looked for somebody to write the code, so chose Murphy. The trio moved into Spiegel’s father’s house in Los Angeles where they worked on the app in the summer of 2011, the lawsuit states. Brown claims he came up with the ghost logo and the original name, Picaboo, which the trio used in the launch of July that year. The following month however they had a falling out and the lawsuit states that Brown was locked out and the other two refused to talk to him. The next month Snapchat was launched. The twins: Twins Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, seen at a special screening of 'The Social Network' in New York, were given a $65million settlement after their claimed part in Facebook . As part of his claim Brown included a photo of all three men by a cake with the Snapchat logo on it, the Los Angeles Times reported. Brown's lawyer Luan Tran told the paper: ‘He wants his share of what he is entitled to’. The claims of start-up skulduggery will be all too familiar to the Winklevoss brothers, who were dubbed the ‘Wiklevii’ in The Social Network. It was in 2003 that they claimed they asked Zuckerberg to write the code on their own social network, called Harvard Connection. They alleged that he then started his own rival called thefacebook.com which went on to become the biggest website of its kind in the world with more than one billion users. Whilst they were given their $65million settlement Zuckerberg has gone on to become one of the richest men in the world. According to the latest Forbes rankings, he is the 35th richest man on Earth with a fortune of $17.5billion, although he was far wealthier before Facebook’s bungled stock market floatation. A representative for Snapchat said: ‘We are aware of the allegations, believe them to be utterly devoid of merit, and will vigorously defend ourselves against this frivolous suit. ‘It would be inappropriate to comment further on this pending legal matter.’","Frank Reginald Brown claims he was shut out of company just after its development .

"Milo, pictured on his first day, was well enough to start school three weeks ago . For most children, the beginning of the school year is an exciting time, especially for those moving from nursery into mainstream schooling for the first time. But for one little boy, this transition is all the more special, having survived five rounds of chemotherapy to treat a rare form of kidney cancer which had spread to his lungs and liver. Milo Carter, four, was diagnosed a year ago, but three weeks ago was well enough to start school thanks to life saving treatment at Great Ormond Street hospital. Now his mother Sarah has decided to share Milo's story to help raise awareness of childhood cancers and the importance of the work of Cancer Research UK, which funds life saving research. Sarah, 36, who lives in Auchtertool, Scotland said: 'I call Milo my little Tonka truck as nothing knocks him and he just keeps on going. 'He's unbelievable and has responded amazingly well to everything that's been thrown at him. Milo has a strong body and all he focuses on are the good things. 'Last summer he was going through major surgery to take out a kidney with cancer in it and this August he was getting his bag packed ready for a first day at school. What a difference a year makes.' But Milo's fierce fight for life started on the day he was born. Sarah recalls vividly how excited she and her husband Kevin were ahead of their first child Milo's birth. Pregnancy scans had not picked up any problems so it was a huge shock when doctors at Victoria hospital, Kirkcaldy explained that Milo was struggling to breathe. At just 72 hours old, Milo went in to heart failure and was blue lighted through to hospital where he endured a nine hour operation to repair his heart. Milo's treatment involved two major operations and aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy . Despite his intensive treatment, Milo has taken everything in his stride, attending nursery whenever he could . Before Milo was diagnosed, the only symptoms he displayed were tiredness and some nausea . Sarah, here with Noah and Milo at a party, is incredibly proud of the way Milo has handled everything . Sarah said: 'The first week after the operation was awful. It took several attempts to get Milo off the ventilator and breathing on his own again. It was so frightening. Milo was in hospital for two and a half months. Staying in that hospital with Milo became my whole life. But we got through it and after we finally got home Milo did really well. 'We started to relax, feeling that Milo had been through his fair share of bad luck and was free to grow up healthy. It never entered our heads that at just three, Milo would have to go through a second life threatening problem totally unrelated to the first. What were the chances of that?' That's why it was a such a blow when just months after Milo's brother Noah, now two, was born, Milo's appetite vanished and he became permanently exhausted. Worried, Sarah took Milo to the doctor who referred them to hospital for more tests. And in April 2013, Milo was diagnosed with a Wilms tumour; a rare and aggressive cancer in both kidneys which scans revealed had already spread to his lungs and liver. Sarah said: 'He needed the highest dose of chemotherapy and radiotherapy they could give. 'Milo's left kidney was twice the size it's meant to be. It was huge and he had three tumours in his second kidney as well as tumours in the main vein leading up to his heart. He started on chemotherapy straight away.' Sarah has decided to share Milo's story to help raise awareness of childhood cancers . Milo (right) with his little brother Noah (centre) and father Kevin during his treatment . At first they were warned that Milo may need to have both kidneys removed- facing a lifetime on dialysis or a transplant. But a surgeon at Great Ormond Street hospital in London succeeded in saving 90 per cent of Milo's right kidney. Explaining to Milo what was happening to him was heartbreaking for his family. Sarah said: 'Milo knew that he wasn't managing to eat a lot. I told him there was something inside called a tumour inside his tummy. 'I explained that he had all those bits in his body and there was something pushing on his tummy that the doctor was going to take out to make him feel better again. I told him there were bad cells that the doctors were going to take away. I tried to be as honest with him as I could.' And in November last year, Milo returned to London to have the tumours on his right kidney removed. Only six days later Milo was well enough to explore all five floors of Hamley's world famous toy shop in Regent Street. Milo spent Christmas at home in Scotland with the family ahead of three weeks in January of radiotherapy . Milo, pictured here with father Kevin, was shown in the latest scans to be tumour free . Sarah, here with Milo and carrying Noah is supporting Give Up Clothes for Good, raising money to help beat childrens’ cancer sooner . It meant Milo could spend Christmas at home in Scotland with the family ahead of three weeks in January of radiotherapy where he had to endure an anaesthetic every day. Sarah said; 'The nursery staff and parents have been amazing. 'They gave me a a photobook with lovely messages and they've been there every step of the way. Through all of this it was really important to me that everything was kept as normal as possible for Milo and he's been at nursery as often as he can be.' Just weeks ago, mum Sarah was speechless when doctors explained that latest scans show the treatment is working. Sarah said; 'That took my breath away. They can see no tumours or abnormalities in his body at the moment. 'Milo absolutely loves school. He finished treatment about three weeks before he started so he didn't feel too unwell and his hair was semi back - so he felt quite normal. 'It's early days now and too early to talk about a cure. But things have gone so well so far and although there may be a lot of worry ahead but we'll get through it with the help of friends and family.' Sarah is supporting Give Up Clothes for Good, a campaign supported by TK Maxx and Cancer Research UK raising money to help beat kids’ cancer sooner. Visit tkmaxx.com . Since 2004, the campaign has raised £13.2m to help the charity find ways to beat children’s cancers sooner by funding research into many areas including developing better treatments that also reduce the long term side effects .","Milo, 4, had his first day at school three weeks ago .

"Liverpool have returned to Europe's elite competition for the first time in five years and their Champions League comeback means the youth team can get involved in the fun too. If you've not come across it by now, the UEFA Youth League is an Under 19 competition that runs parallel to the main show. And Liverpool's maiden appearance in the tournament was a big success as their academy side defeated Ludogorets Razgrad 4-0 on Tuesday afternoon. The star of the show at Langtree Park in St Helens was forward Jerome Sinclair, who notched two goals in the comprehensive win. But who is the hotshot tipped for a big future at Anfield? Sportsmail has everything you need to know. Jerome Sinclair scored twice as Liverpool's Under 19s beat Ludogorets Razgrad in the UEFA Youth League . Name: Jerome Sinclair . Age: 17 . Club: Liverpool . Position: Striker . I'm going to need more than that... In contrast to the senior side, who needed a stoppage time penalty to overcome Ludogorets at Anfield later in the day, Liverpool's youngsters were far too powerful for their Bulgarian opponents. They ran the show from first whistle to last in the St Helens sunshine and the chances and goals flowed at frequent intervals. If they had sustained the free-flowing football of the first-half, in which they scored three times, this could have been a victory for the record books. But in the end, four goals was more than sufficient, with Jerome Sinclair very happy with his match-defining double. His first, on the half-hour mark, was an accomplished finish after left-back Sam Hart had split the Ludogorets back line with a surging run from deep. Sinclair is congratulated by team-mate Sam Hart after scoring Liverpool's opening goal against Lodogorets . Sinclair showing his pace and acceleration during a FA Youth Cup tie at Blackburn in December 2013 . His second, three minutes from time, was a straightforward piece of opportunism, pouncing to score on the rebound after Harry Wilson's free-kick had rebounded off the post. These were just two examples of the many types of goal Sinclair is capable of and a small glimpse into the buzz around a 17-year-old coaches at Anfield believe can become the next Raheem Sterling. Sinclair already holds the distinction of being the youngest player to turn out for Liverpool, making his senior debut with a nine-minute cameo in a League Cup tie at West Brom in september 2012. He was a tender 16 years and six days old. Why all the fuss? Well, although that remains Sinclair's one and only senior outing, he has been making great strides at youth team and Under 21 level. Born in Birmingham in September 1996, Sinclair was a member of the West Brom academy between the ages of 10 and 14 before being spotted by Liverpool. He spent the 2011-2012 campaign mainly with the Under 16 side but made a handful of appearances for the Under 18 team towards the end. Sinclair gets the better of Manchester United's Joe Riley in an Under 18 Premier League fixture . Sinclair takes on Alex Davey of Chelsea in the 2013 FA Youth Cup semi-final, second leg at Stamford Bridge . His coach Mike Marsh was impressed by his talent and a 15-year-old Sinclair was even invited to rub shoulders with the likes of Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard at Melwood, something he later described as a 'great learning curve.' It wasn't long before Sinclair found his scoring boots, with a prolific pre-season in 2012 leading to a call up into the squad Rodolfo Borrell was about to lead into the NextGen Series. Sinclair impressed in the first group match away to Inter Milan, winning a penalty that Krisztian Adorjan converted and going close himself on a number of occasions. Liverpool were narrowly beaten 3-2 in that game but went on to advance from the group, Sinclair scoring his first goal in continental competition in a 4-1 win over Rosenborg. Sinclair shifts the ball to try and get past Man United defender Ro-Shaun Williams in an Under 18 fixture . These appearances came either side of that first team run-out at The Hawthorns, a moment Sinclair described as a 'dream come true' in a later interview. Sinclair has since represented the club's Under 18 team and also made three appearances for the Under 21s at the tail end of last season. His double against Ludogorets will only enhance his reputation, with group matches against Real Madrid and Basle to come. What about international recognition? Sinclair has represented England at Under 16 and Under 17 level. His debut came in the Victory Shield in October 2011, when Wales were beaten 4-0. His first goals for the Three Lions came at the 2012 Montaigu Tournament in France, helping to secure wins against the hosts and also Morocco. Sinclair in England colours breaking through the Italian defence in an Under 17 international in August 2012 . What are his strengths? As shown in the Youth League, Sinclair is already a good finisher and has a knack of getting into the right place at the right time to gobble up loose balls. He seems strong on both feet when in and around the penalty area and has good placement. At 5ft 8in, Sinclair won't win a great deal in their air but he has tricky feet and good acceleration too, so he fits in with the fluid passing game the Liverpool academy try to foster. What happens next? Sinclair can really make a name for himself in the Youth League, especially if he performs in the matches against real Madrid, which will enjoy a raised profile. He will continue to get opportunities for the Under 21 team and has plenty of time on his side to mature and develop in this age bracket. Though unlikely to break into the first team just yet, he is well on the way to realising his abundant potential.

"Get rich quick: Slavica Ecclestone topped the richest divorcees list when she was awarded an estimated £740million after splitting from Bernie in 2009 . Marry rich but divorce even richer – that’s the way to join the ranks of the super-wealthy. Divorce has paid well for several women in Britain whose settlements have seen them walk from court with hundreds of millions of pounds. Slavica Ecclestone topped the Sunday Times’ Rich List in the ‘richest divorcees’ category after she was awarded an estimated £740million in 2009 in her divorce from Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone when their 23-year marriage ended on the grounds of his ‘unreasonable behaviour’. Coming in second was Irina Malandina who walked away with a reported £155million in 2007 from her divorce to Russian Roman Abramovich, one of the richest men in the world, after 16 years of marriage and five children together. Glamorous former Bosnian refugee Diana Jenkins got a sizeable chunk of her ex-husband Roger Jenkins’ fortune he made as a tax expert at Barclays Bank, pocketing an estimated £150million after her ten-year marriage. The estranged couple called their 2011 split as ‘the happiest divorce ever’ and last year she joined him among Britain’s wealthiest 500 individuals as a result. Galina Besharova made her millions in seconds, awarded £100million in a 45-second divorce to the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky in 2011 while Beverley Charman also made the top ten when she received a record-breaking £48million in 2006 after her split from millionaire businessman John Charman. Ayesha Vardag from Vardags told The Times: ‘In England today, the single easiest way for an attractive woman to make her fortune is to marry a very rich man and then divorce him a few years later, preferably after having a child.’ Family partner at Withers Mark Harper said: 'Since 2000, divorce in England has been about sharing the fruits of the marital partnership. 'Those fruits have grown rich and . luscious with the growth in international wealth and so wives divorcing . in England have benefittted from the change in the law to a percentage . division in assets.'

"A teenager who has been jailed for five years for raping a six-year-old boy knew exactly what he was doing when he carried out the sickening attack, a crown court judge has said. Judge Brian Forster QC said the attacker from South Tyneside, who was 15 at the time of the offence, took advantage of the schoolboy for his 'own sexual satisfaction'. He added that he was 'quite sure' that the teenager - who the court heard has become a 'hate target' since the attack - knew what he was doing was 'very wrong'. A teenage schoolboy has been jailed for five years at Newcastle Crown Court, pictured above, for raping a six-year-old boy for his 'own sexual satisfaction' Speaking at Newcastle Crown Court, the judge said: 'The circumstances were fully considered by the jury during the course of the trial. 'I had the opportunity to assess you during the course of the trial and I am quite sure you knew what you were doing was very wrong.' The attacker, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denied his guilt, meaning the young victim was forced to give evidence at the trial. But jurors convicted the defendant - who the judge described as 'cocky' - of two charges of rape. Both charges related to the one incident which took place last year. The court also heard how, just months after raping the boy, the teenager was convicted of having sex with an underage girl. The judge added: 'You took advantage of him for your own sexual satisfaction. It is important to keep in mind that the long term impact of this type of offending on a young victim is unknown. 'I have found you to be a cocky young man. I noted the way which you answered questions and it is clear to me you knew that what you were doing was very wrong.' For the defence, David Callan said the teen, who the court heard has poor school attendance, had become a hate target and was recently hospitalised after a violent attack. He added that the attacker was immature for his age. In sentencing the teenager, the judge said he needed to consider the defendant's welfare, but also needed to prevent him from commmitting further crimes. He  ordered the defendant, who is now 16, to sign the sex offenders' register for life. The defendant was also put under a sexual offences prevention order for the next ten years.","Judge Forster said teen took advantage of boy for 'own sexual satisfaction'

"It's the sort of far-fetched accident you would expect to see in a Tom and Jerry sketch - but what happened to Quasimodo the cat is no laughing matter. After being hit by a car at 70mph, the poor moggy became wedged head first in the front of the vehicle as it drove a further ten miles down the motorway. With his top half buried in the car's grill and pressed against the hot running engine, the tips of his ears were agonisingly burnt off - leaving him as deformed as his namesake. No laughing matter: Quasimodo is half concealed with his head wedged in the car's grill . The collision happened shortly before midnight when Stephanie Huber was driving her Peugeot at full speed on the A14 past the Gisikon exit heading towards Lucerne, Switzerland. The young woman told police she had not seen anything, but had heard a muffled thud and carried on without thinking much of it. But when she parked in Lucerne she realised that the grill on the front bumper had a cat's body sticking out of it, with the head wedged inside. When she saw the animal was alive, she quickly called the police. Swiss police spokesman Urs Wigger said: 'After hearing that a motorist had struck an animal at 120 kilometres-an-hour we were positive it wouldn't be alive, especially after then being carried along by the car for another 12 kilometres. 'When we found out that it had indeed survived, it was a real surprise. Sticky situation:  The poor cat was left completely helpless after being hit by the car at 70mph and dragged for another ten miles down the motorway . 'The officers were unable to free the cat and so a vet was called to carry out the complicated procedure.' The vet, Nico Kipfer, 38,  then tranquillised Quasimodo so that it could be removed without causing further injury. The stricken animal was taken to the veterinary surgery in Lucerne where it needed to be operated on several times to treat head injuries. Mr Kipfer added: 'We had to operate on him three or four times but he is now out of danger for sure.' Road to recovery: Despite having most of his ears burnt off, Quasimodo is now on the mend . Animal clinic boss Martin Keiser, 46, said that Quasimodo had head injuries but that the real damage had been caused by the hot motor. He added: 'I don't think in all my years as a person in charge of an animal clinic that I have ever such a remarkable survival story.' When the owner was not found, the vet nicknamed the cat Quasimodo to match his new unfortunate appearance. He has now been adopted by staff at the clinic, who say they want to keep him after all they have been through together.","Driver only saw the cat when she parked in next town - Lucerne, Switzerland .

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers insists the club's efforts to strengthen over the summer in which they have lost Luis Suarez should not be compared to the case of Tottenham and Gareth Bale from a year ago.

Forward Suarez followed Bale in making a mega-money switch to Spain by signing for Barcelona in July, by which time Liverpool had already been spending significantly on new players and have continued to do so. Scroll down for videos... Nothing compares: Brendan Rodgers insists Liverpool have not spent for same reasons as Spurs last season . Big bucks: Gareth Bale and Luis Suarez left the Premier League for Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively . Nine have been recruited by the Reds in the transfer window to date, with the latest being the most high-profile in maverick Italy striker Mario Balotelli. How it all comes together remains to be seen, but Rodgers, whose side face Tottenham away in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday, is feeling optimistic about his restructured squad. And asked about his confidence that Liverpool will not suffer the problems Spurs have post-Bale, the Northern Irishman said: 'I think it is totally different circumstances. 'Spurs were a strong squad, had a top, world-class player in Gareth Bale and they will have their reasons for bringing in their players. 'For us, I think it is pretty obvious we were very low in terms of our numbers and that quality and depth. 'So, irrespective of Luis staying or going, it was something we had to do and I'm very glad we did it, because I look at the quality in our training and it has gone up a level. Maverick: Italy international Mario Balotelli (R) is one of nine new arrivals at Anfield this summer . One in, one out: Dejan Lovren was signed in a £20million deal from Southampton, while Daniel Agger has left . 'I see the hunger that the young players coming into the squad have given and the boost that has given the senior players as well. 'I think it is different circumstances, but obviously over the course of the coming years we will see.' While Tottenham could only finish sixth last term, Liverpool, who thrashed them 5-0 at White Hart Lane and then 4-0 at Anfield during the campaign, surprised many by comfortably securing a Champions League berth and going close to claiming the Premier League title, eventually coming second. Back in the European competition for the first time since 2009, the Reds discovered on Thursday that they are set to come up against Bale, having been drawn with defending champions Real in Group B. Same again? Philippe Coutinho (C) scores one of nine goals that Liverpool put past Spurs last season . Training day: Mauricio Pochettino (2R) prepares for Liverpool's visit to White Hart Lane on Sunday . Rodgers, who will be in charge of Liverpool for a 100th competitive game on Sunday, is relishing the prospect of taking on the Primera Division giants. He said: 'It was great on Thursday for the supporters and is great that Liverpool are back in their rightful place in the Champions League. 'They are two clubs that are very special - you are looking at 15-times winners between the two (five times for Liverpool, 10 for Real), which is incredible. 'There is no doubt it felt good on Thursday and must have been great for everyone connected with Liverpool to watch the draw'. Certainly Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard, who won the Champions League with the club in 2005, was an excited viewer on Thursday. 'It was massive - I planned my whole day around the Champions League draw, I had friends and family round and we had it on the television,' Gerrard told liverpoolfc.com. 'We couldn't wait for it, it was so exciting. I've missed it so much. There's almost a jealousy when you watch the Champions League and you're not involved in it.

"Scottish banks will be broken up and oil giant BP nationalised to punish them for backing the No campaign, a leading SNP figure warned last night. In an extraordinary intervention, the Scottish National Party’s former deputy leader said businesses that had spoken out against independence would face a ‘day of reckoning’. Jim Sillars said: ‘This referendum is about power, and when we get a Yes majority, we will use that power for a day of reckoning with BP and the banks. Tirade: Jim Sillars (right), the former deputy leader of the SNP and a key ally of Alex Salmond (centre), said oil giant BP would need to 'learn the meaning of nationalisation' and major banks would be broken up . 'The heads of these companies are rich men, in cahoots with a rich English Tory Prime Minister, to keep Scotland’s poor poorer through lies and distortions.’ The threats were last night condemned by opponents of independence, who said the Yes camp’s ‘mask has slipped’. On BP, which has questioned SNP leader Alex Salmond’s extravagant claims about Scotland’s oil reserves, Mr Sillars said: ‘BP, in an independent Scotland, will need to learn the meaning of nationalisation, in part or in whole.’ He added: ‘If it wants into the “monster fields” in the areas west of Shetland, it will have to learn to bend the knee to a greater power – us, the sovereign people of Scotland. ‘We will be masters of the oil fields, not BP or any of the other majors.’ Firebrand: Mr Sillars (pictured in the red tie) declared in his speech: 'We will be masters of the oil fields, not BP' Mr Sillars – a leading member of the independence campaign hailed for his ‘fantastic’ work by Mr Salmond this week – also called for a boycott on stores that had backed the No campaign. Labour MP Ian Davidson said: ‘Now we see the real face of nationalism in all its ugliness.’ Mr Sillars’s threats came as economists and business leaders issued new dire warnings about the impact of a Yes vote. In a string of bleak warnings: . Frozen out: Iceland boss Malcolm Walker warned his response to a Yes vote would be 'panic' The SNP has been infuriated by warnings from big business about the economic risks of a Yes vote, accusing business leaders of ‘scare-mongering’. Its economic case was shattered on Thursday after Scots were warned by a string of retailers that higher prices were inevitable if the nation voted to split from the UK. Asda, Waitrose, John Lewis and Marks and Spencer all sounded warnings, while the Bank of England warned of huge tax rises and analysts said the universal postal service would also be in doubt. In his explosive response yesterday, Mr Sillars declared that leading banks, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and TSB, faced being broken up for warning they will move their headquarters to England if Scotland goes independent. And major retailers such as John Lewis could face consumer boycotts after warning that independence will force up prices at the checkout. Mr Walker said Iceland had 71 stores and a major distribution centre in Scotland. ‘The consequences will be just massive,’ he told Channel 4 News, adding that his first response to a Yes vote on Thursday would be to ‘panic!’ ‘To be perfectly honest with you, we didn’t take it too seriously. I don’t think anybody for one moment considered that there would be a Yes vote.’ Figures yesterday showed that growing fears of a split have led to more than £17billion being pulled out of the UK in the past month. The sum is the largest amount of money moved out of Britain in a single month since the financial crisis hit in 2008. Heating up: Mr Salmond's Yes campaign has suffered several stark warnings from big business this week . More than £127billion has been pulled out of the UK’s stock markets and debt markets so far this year, according to figures from consultancy CrossBorder Capital. Swiss banking giant UBS also warned that Scotland’s economy could shrink by as much as 5 per cent if it voted to leave. An independent Scotland would shed jobs and tax revenues as banks and major firms relocated to England under a cloud of uncertainty over the future, the bank said. Analyst Paul Donovan said: ‘Until there is clarity over the currency arrangements and the banking system, Scotland is likely to suffer some degree of a credit crunch.’ He warned that ‘half of the banking sector’ would move to England before independence takes hold fully in 2016. The report added to the mountain of evidence about the dire economic consequences of a victory for the Yes campaign. Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley also said it had seen the highest amount of selling ‘on record’ as investors queued up to pull their funds out of Britain. Nigel Farage’s visit to Scotland yesterday to campaign for the Union will have persuaded voters to back independence, Alex Salmond claimed last night. The First Minister said the Ukip leader joining the campaign trail in Glasgow to ask Scots to vote No was a gift to the Yes campaign. Mr Farage said that he had gone there to win back Labour supporters who had decided to vote for independence. Fury: Protesters against Nigel Farage's visit in Glasgow last night. He described Scotland as 'our territory' But before he had even arrived he had upset Scots by describing Scotland as simply ‘a large chunk of our territory’. At a Ukip rally last night, Mr Farage said the Prime Minister had been ‘moronic’ for not putting the option of maximum devolution on the ballot paper along with Yes and No. He said: ‘I was astonished that the Prime Minister allowed for the separatists to be given the “yes” side of the referendum question. ‘Far better from his point of view, you would have thought, would have been to have asked the question “Should Scotland remain part of the United Kingdom?”. But no, on this he blundered and more fundamentally he blundered by not offering the Scottish people, the “devo max” option.’ Anger: Mr Farage has had a hostile reception in Scotland before and it was repeated last night in Glasgow . Earlier, Mr Farage had suggested the Queen has a responsibility to speak out and tell Scots not to vote for independence if the polls are still close tomorrow. Mr Salmond said the Ukip leader was an asset to the Yes camp because of ‘Ukip’s negative, insular, anti-European brand of politics’. Last night 60 demonstrators gathered outside the Ukip rally and Mr Farage was smuggled in a side door to avoid them. It overshadowed an event held by Labour last night, which saw party leader Ed Miliband share a platform with former prime minister Gordon Brown for the first time since he left Downing Street in 2010.","Extraordinary intervention last night from former deputy leader Jim Sillars .

"Malaysian Airlines flight MH17  was most likely shot down from the ground, says the detective charged with finding those responsible for the crash. The airplane plunged to earth while flying over territory held by pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine on July 17 after taking off from Amsterdam, killing all 298 passengers and crew on board. Detective Fred Westerbeke, who is overseeing the criminal investigation in to the incident, revealed it was 'most likely' shot down but warned it may take years to prosecute the culprits as violence rages on war-torn Ukraine. Scroll down for video . Flight MH17 was 'most likely' shot down from the ground says the detective charged with finding those responsible for the tragedy. An emergency services worker examines the wreckage of the flight in eastern Ukraine . Ukrainian servicemen inspect the crash site in July. Dutch investigators, who are charged with leading the hunt for those responsible for the crash, say it could take years to identify and prosecute culprits as conflict rages on in eastern Ukraine . 'It's going to be a long investigation. I don't rule out that we can identify a suspect and bring this to a prosecution,' he said after revealing the theory that the flight was shot down was 'the one getting the most attention' from the Dutch National Prosecutors Office. It has previously speculated the flight was brought down accidentally by pro-Russian rebels fighting over territory in eastern Ukraine. The theory that the Kremlin aided rebel fighters by supplying them with weapons has been vehemently denied by President Vladimir Putin. Shortly after the disaster in June, a highly placed rebel revealed in a press interview that the plane had been shot down by a mixed team of rebels and Russian military personnel who believed they were targeting a Ukrainian military plane. Intercepted phone calls between fighters supported his claims. Dutch police chief Patricia Zorko said detectives were considering more than 300million web pages and thousands of images as part of the investigation into the tragedy. The flight took off from Schiphol airport near Amsterdam on July 17 shortly after 12.30pm (pictured). All 298 passengers and crew on board were killed when it plummeted . Flowers and cuddly toys are left at a monument for the tragic flight in the village of Hrabove, some 80km east of Donetsk . 'More investigation is underway to find out where these things come from,' she said. Detective Westerbeke's comments come after a separate report claimed the aircraft was split into multiple pieces before it hit the ground. The report by the Dutch Safety Board said it was likely the damage caused 'resulted in a loss of structural integrity of the aircraft, leading to an in-flight break up.' Its findings were supported by the U.S. State Department, a spokesman for which said it matched 'our original assessment, that it was likely shot down by one of these surface-to-air missiles fired from separatist-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine.' The full report is expected to be completed by next July.","Fred Westerbeke said theory was getting 'most attention' as investigation continues .

"The ozone layer that shields the Earth from the sun is showing the first signs of recovery, UN scientists have revealed. The gaping hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica  – which in the 1980s caused a major environmental scare – has stopped growing, they have found. And other damage to the ozone layer is ‘well on track’ to recovery and may have even been reversed by 2050, according the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization. Earth's protective but fragile ozone layer is finally starting to rebound, says a United Nations panel of scientists. Scientists hail this as rare environmental good news, demonstrating that when the world comes together it can stop a brewing ecological crisis. Here the shifting size of the ozone hole is illustrated in a dark blue . Ozone forms a ‘screen’ in the upper levels of the atmosphere which absorbs damaging solar rays. Evidence emerged 30 years ago that ozone was being severely depleted by man-made gases, such as the CFCs used in fridges. It caused a huge health scare, especially in southern-hemisphere countries such as Australia and New Zealand, which are situated close to the massive hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica. Earth's ozone forms a protective 'screen' in the upper atmosphere that absorbs damaging solar rays. It shields Earth from the sun, but 30 years ago it emerged that man-made gases were severely depleting it, opening up 'holes' and increasing radiation risks on Earth. This led to a ban on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), pollutants found in items such as fridges. And now actions such as these have enabled the ozone to start recovering, according to the latest report. Experts predicted that the reduced screening from UV rays would lead to soaring rates of skin cancer. The scare led to a 1987 ban on CFC gases in fridges and aerosols – an action that the UN said is responsible for the ozone recovery and has saved 2 million a year from skin cancer. WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud said: ‘International action on the ozone layer is a major environmental success story.’ The hole in the ozone layer will start shrinking in about a decade, scientists hope. WMO senior scientific officer Geir Braathen added: ‘Now for the first time in this report we say that we see indications of a small increase in total ozone. That means recovery of the ozone layer in terms of total ozone has just started. The ozone layer that shields the Earth from the Sun is showing the first signs of recovery, UN scientists have revealed. The gaping hole in the ozone - which in the 1980s caused a major environmental scare - has stopped growing, they have found . 'We think in about 2025 or thereabouts we’ll be able to say with certainty that the ozone hole is getting smaller.’ Professor David Vaughan from the British Antarctic Survey said that test results from his organisation would throw extra light on the WMO’s findings. ‘We have to be a bit cautious, but this does look on the face of it like some very good news,’ he said. ‘Our own data from the Antarctic will take a few weeks to process but we hope to confirm the findings. If it’s accurate, it underlines the potential power of international agreement.’ Achim Steiner, UNEP’s executive director, used the success of the international protocol to call for a similar international deal on climate change. David Cameron announced this week he will travel to New York on September 23 for an international summit on climate change. Barack Obama has also agreed to attend – but the ability of the conference to see meaningful agreements has been undermined by news that the leaders of Germany, China and India will not be there.","Gaping hole in ozone which in 1980s caused a major environmental scare .

"Phone companies have revealed the cost of using mobiles and land-lines will 'inevitably' rise if Scotland leaves the UK . Phone bills are set to rise for millions of Scots if the country votes for independence next week. BT and a host of telecoms firms are to set out plans that mean higher costs for almost every Scottish family will be ‘inevitable’. It comes on top of mounting evidence that the cost of living for families in Scotland will soar after independence. Major stores including Asda and Next warned that prices on essentials such as bread, milk and children’s clothes will rise. The boss of Iceland has now added his voice to growing concerns, saying he would ‘panic’ if Scotland voted Yes. And figures published yesterday showed that fears of a split have led to more than £17billion being pulled out of the UK in the last month. It is the largest amount of money moved out of Britain in a single month since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. More than £127billion has been pulled out of the UK’s stock markets and debt markets so far this year, according to figures from consultancy CrossBorder Capital. Swiss banking giant UBS also warned that Scotland’s economy could shrink by as much as 5 per cent if it votes to leave. The cost of landlines, mobile phones and internet will increase in Scotland, a host of firms will say before the vote. BT is in talks with mobile providers Vodafone, EE and O2 as well as TalkTalk about issuing a joint statement warning of the implications of separation. It will be released over the weekend or early next week. The cost of installing broadband cables or mobile phone masts are already higher in Scotland because of the distances involved. Currently these are subsidised by the rest of the UK, but an independent Scotland would be likely to have its own separate pricing structure. A draft of the letter was yesterday said to warn of ‘the inevitability of cost increases’. Several companies are waiting to see the final wording before agreeing to sign. The announcement adds to mounting evidence the cost of living for families in Scotland is likely to soar if the country chooses to leave the UK on September 18 . The talks are being led by BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, who is also president of business lobby group the CBI. BT, Vodafone, O2 and TalkTalk refused to comment but an EE spokesman said: ‘Independence is entirely an issue for the Scottish people. Any political changes could of course add complexity to our operations and for this reason we are keeping a close eye on the referendum. ‘We remain fully committed to our network, employees and customers in Scotland.’ A separate letter warning of price rises by a host of retailers is also set to be published before the vote on Thursday. The traditional white, red and blue of the Union Flag could be replaced by yellow, red and black if Scotland votes Yes. The Flag Institute has drawn up a new design that shows the cross of St Andrew replaced by elements of the St David’s flag. The flag institute has drawn up a design for a potential new flag if Scotland leaves the union . Written by Sir Ian Cheshire, boss of B&Q owner Kingfisher, the letter has also been signed by the chiefs of Marks & Spencer, John Lewis and Asda. John Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield this week warned that the department store would be forced to pass on higher costs of operating in an independent Scotland. Iceland boss Malcolm Walker, whose chain has 71 stores and a major distribution centre in Scotland and employs more than 2,000 people, said his first response to a Yes vote would be to ‘panic!’. ‘The consequences will be just massive,’ he told Channel 4 News. ‘To be perfectly honest with you, we didn’t take it too seriously. 'I don’t think anybody for one moment considered that there would be a Yes vote.’ Large Scottish banks including RBS and Lloyds have drawn up contingency plans to move their registered offices South. UBS said an independent Scotland would shed jobs and tax revenues. Economists at the bank said: ‘Until there is clarity over the currency arrangements and the banking system, Scotland is likely to suffer some degree of a credit crunch. ‘Scottish GDP would suffer a one-off contraction of somewhere between four per cent and five per cent as half of the banking sector moves to Britain before independence.’ A spokesman from Deutsche Bank said last night that ‘a Yes vote would go down in history as a political and economic mistake as large as Winston Churchill’s decision in 1925 to return the pound to the Gold Standard or the failure of the Federal Reserve to provide sufficient liquidity to the US banking system, which we now know brought on the Great Depression in the US’.","BT is among the many telecom firms which say hike in prices is 'inevitable'

"Gable Tostee was 'heavily intoxicated' and 'causing alarm' on the Gold Coast between 2am and 3am in the months before his fateful date with balcony fall victim Warriena Wright, court documents allege. The documents, filed by prosecutors in Brisbane Supreme Court to oppose the 28-year-old's bid for bail this week, also allege he repeatedly told a police officer to 'f*** off' and called him a 'small man' during an incident on January 27 at a Surfers Paradise convenience store. The bodybuilder and carpet layer was also charged with high-range drink driving in July this year, the documents filed on Monday claim. Scroll down for video . Eleven days before Warriena Wright (pictured) fell to her death from Gable Tostee's Surfers Paradise balcony, Mr Tostee was arrested for high range drink driving on the Gold Coast, documents filed with his bail application in the Brisbane Supreme Court allege . Gable Tostee's criminal history includes four outstanding charges, according to documents filed by both prosecutors and his own defence during his bail application on a murder charge. Tostee was 'heavily intoxicated' and 'causing alarm' on the Gold Coast between 2am and 3am on January 27, prosecutors say in the court documents . His criminal history, which includes four outstanding charges for which he was on bail, are part of a legal brief tendered in the court before Justice Debra Mullins during his bail application on a murder charge. Gable Tostee is charged with the August 8 murder of New Zealander, Warriena Wright. His lawyer, Michael Purcell, told the court his client will strenuously defend the charge, which Mr Purcell described as inappropriate. In Mr Tostee's bail application, he admitted to two past offences, namely a forgery charge in 2006 for which no conviction was recorded, a 2011 driving charge, and four outstanding charges from this year which are due to be mentioned in the Southport Magistrates Court on October 10. Two outstanding charges against Mr Tostee from January 27 relate to an alleged incident which took place after police were flagged down by a tuk-tuk driver who claimed he had run from the vehicle without paying his fare, according to the court documents. Prosecutors claim, in the court documents, Mr Tostee was standing in a nearby Surfers Paradise convenience store on Ferny Avenue, buying chocolate and 'using obscene language' when Constable Leigh Hurley approached him and was told twice to 'f*** off'. The court documents state Constable Hurley observed Mr Tostee was 'causing alarm to members of the public attempting to purchase items from the store and that he was interfering with 'peaceable business'. When the officer arrested Mr Tostee, the defendant allegedly said to him, according to court documents: 'What are you going to do small man, f*** off c***'. Prosecutors allege, in the court documents, after being placed in the rear of a police vehicle, Mr Tostee then allegedly put his foot in the door to prevent it being closed, said 'f*** off' again, 'violently kicked out at' Sergeant Stephen Wright, who sprayed Tostee with capsicum spray which 'had no effect'. He was charged with one count each of commit public nuisance and assault or obstruct a police officer, according to the court documents. Warriena Wright, pictured with her mother Beth (left) and younger sister Reza (centre), is alleged in the court documents to have met Gable Tostee on a Tinder date on August 7 in Surfers Paradise. The court documents claim she died after falling from the balcony of the apartment rented by Mr Tostee, who has made an application for bail on a charge of murdering her . Reza Wright (left), the sister of Warriena (right) flew to the Gold Coast following Ms Wright's death and made an impassioned plea for members of the public to come forward with any clues as to the case . The court documents filed during Mr Tostee's bail application on Monday say he was charged on July 27 with driving under the influence of liquor and breaching bail. The court documents allege that at 3am on July 27, Mr Tostee was detected 'travelling at high speed' in a silver Ford Falcon on the highway across the NSW border. The court documents say NSW Police attempted to intercept the vehicle by throwing tyre spikes across the road, but the vehicle continued over the Queensland border until it came to a stop. Queensland Police breathalysed Mr Tostee, who allegedly had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.203 - nearly five times more than the legal limit, it is alleged in court documents. He had also breached bail conditions he had been placed on in January following the alleged incident on Ferny Avenue, according to the court documents. Gable Tostee (right) was also charged with drink driving, according to court documents filed during his bail application on a charge of murdering Warriena Wright (left)  who plunged from the apartment block on August 8 . Tostee was living in this Surfers Paradise block, the Avalon Apartments when he was charged on January 27 with assaulting or obstructing  a police officer while allegedly 'heavily intoxicated', according to court documents . The court documents about the charges which were filed included an alleged transcript of conversations between Mr Tostee and the late Warriena Wright inside his apartment on August 8, along with character references for Mr Tostee. Justice Mullins adjourned Mr Tostee's bail application on the murder charge on Monday, giving Mr Tostee's defence team more time to revisit part of the bail application after the prosecution told the court Tostee was unlikely to have been on the balcony when Ms Wright plunged 14-storeys to her death. 'The prosecution case is that the applicant wasn't on the balcony that Ms Wright fell from?' Justice Mullins asked. Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden replied: 'That appears to be the most likely scenario'. Justice Mullins described the Crown prosecutor's case for murder as 'weak' and 'difficult', but said a case of manslaughter would be 'strong'. Justice Mullins said a diagnosis of autism for Gable Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his Surfers Paradise apartment on the night Ms Wright died. 'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' she told defence barrister Tony Kimmins. 'But in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.' Gable Tostee was out in Surfers Paradise on the night of January 27 this year, police say in court documents, when he told an officer to 'f*** off you c***' after he was accused of not paying for a tuk-tuk fare and allegedly 'causing alarm to members of the public' inside a convenience store .

Mr Tappin, who said that he feared the fox might bite him, said that the animal reacted aggressively when he tried to scare it - walking towards him rather than backing away. He said: 'My granddaughter could have been bitten. 'I wouldn't leave a puppy or a dog I trusted with my granddaughter. You don't expect there to be a fox in the house. 'It held me prisoner in my own property. I went out to try to scare it away with water - it just came towards me. 'My wife, Christine, even threw a pan of water at it. She is terrified. Trapped: Mr Tappin, who works at Tilbury docks, was unable to go to work while he tried to scare away the fox, pictured outside. He tried to chase it away, and splashed it with water, but the animal refused to leave . 'I couldn't get any closer than four feet to it. What happens if it bites me? What happens if it does something else? 'The police told me you can't hurt an animal and I told them I don't want it to invade my property. 'Canvey people have just about had enough of these foxes.' Mr Tappin called Castle Point Council, the RSPCA and Essex Police for help with the fox. The animal paced around his daughter's home between noon and 4.30pm on Thursday, when an RSPCA inspector came to remove it. Removed: The fox circled Mr Tappin's daughter's house for more than four hours - until an RSPCA investigator came to sedate the animal and take it away. Mr Tappin said he thought the animal might have been sick . Mr Tappin said that he thought the  fox may have been ill as it appeared 'mangy' and was being sick just before the inspector arrived. Mr Tappin, who works at Tilbury Docks, was unable to go to work while he tried to sort the problem. He believes the foxes are being attracted by people having to store rubbish and recycling in their gardens. He added: 'Nobody wanted anything to do with the foxes, but there is a plague of them on Canvey at the moment.'","Philip Tappin was visiting his daughter's home on Canvey Island, Essex .
