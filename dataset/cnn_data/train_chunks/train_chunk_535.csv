Gold bars stolen in a £1 million bullion snatch involving the stepfather of The Only Way Is Essex stars Sam and Billie Faiers were found hidden inside a woman’s bra, a court heard today. The alleged gang used an ‘inside man’ to steal the gold in a fake lorry hi-jacking in Belgium before trying to smuggle it back to the UK and convert it into cash. Sheron Mancini, 53, was later caught with two ingots inside her underwear when she was stopped by Belgian police in a car with her husband David Gale a week after the snatch, the Old Bailey heard. Accused: Sheron Mancini was discovered with bars of gold in her bra, a jury was told . ‘She could provide no sensible explanation for the discovery of this gold concealed in her underwear,’ said prosecutor John Price QC. ‘For in truth, there could be none.’ Gale, 55, who has already admitted his part in the plot, was caught with grains of silver stolen in the same raid inside his travel bag at the same time. Also among the six who have pleaded guilty to the conspiracy is David Chatwood, 58, who is married to the Faiers sisters’ mother Sue Wells and shares a home with them in Brentwood. Mancini is on trial alongside John . Corley, 52, Kyriacos Nicolas, 30, and his father Andreas Nicolas, 50, . over their alleged involvement. Jurors in the trial have been told the Faiers sisters will be called as witnesses during the case. Belgian . police discovered lorry driver Brian Mulcahy, 46, seemingly locked . inside the trailer of his vehicle at a service station near Wetteren . last October 4, jurors have been told. He . had been transporting a consigment of 25kg of gold bullion and 150kg of . silver grain from Vilvoorde, near Brussels, back to the UK. 'Organised plot': John Corley is accused of being been instrumental in the heist . In the dock: Nicolas Kyriacos denies the charges made against him . Mulcahy, who has admitted his part in the crime, told officers he had been hijacked and gunpoint and his cargo stolen before he was locked inside the trailer. But his account was ‘pure fiction’, said Mr Price. ‘Mr Mulcahy had not been the victim of a robbery,’ he added. ‘No violence or threat or violence was used against him. ‘It hadn’t been necessary for anyone to do so because in this instance the driver of the lorry was one of the thieves.’ But the plan was ‘doomed to fail’, said the prosecutor, because several key players were under surveillance by UK police. Corley is said to have been instrumental in the plot, travelling to the continent on several occasions and attending regular meetings with other conspirators. TOWIE: Sam and Billie Faiers will be called as witness, the jury was told . Jurors have been told he will not dispute he was present, but will claim he did not realise the nature of the plan. Corley, of Biggin Hill, Kent; and Kyriacos Nicolas, of Winchmore Hill, north London, deny alternative counts of conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to conceal, disguise, convert or transfer criminal property. Mancini, of Roydon, Harlow, Essex; and Andreas Nicolas, of Duxford, Cambridgeshire, deny conspiracy to conceal, disguise, convert or transfer criminal property. Mancini was cleared of conspiracy to steal on the directions of the judge after prosecutors offered no evidence shortly after a jury was sworn in to try her. Stanely Rose, 75, Gary Cummings, 51, and Matthew Middleton, 42, along with Chatwood, Mulcahy and Gale, have already admitted their part in the plot. Chatwood, of Brentwood, Essex; Mulcahy, of Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex; Middleton, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex; Rose, of Pilgrims Hatch, Brentwoodand; Cummings, of Ilford, Essex; Middleton, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex, all admitted conspiracy to steal.

"By . Rob Cooper and Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . UPDATED: . 05:05 EST, 15 December 2011 . Tube drivers whose salary is set to rocket to more than £50,000 a year came under fire yesterday for planning a four-day strike over pay. They are planning to walk out on Boxing Day, bringing severe disruption to the capital. December 26 is one of the biggest days in the retail calendar as shops – many of which are battling for survival – begin their post-Christmas sales. Strike action: Aslef, which represents 60 per cent of the 3,500 Tube drivers, has announced four days of industrial action that will bring London to a standstill . Shoppers pour into London on Boxing Day to snap up a bargain, but the strike will prevent many travelling into the capital. The walkout is being organised by the . transport union Aslef. It balloted 2,200 of its members, who make up . around 60 per cent of London Underground drivers. Of those who voted, 92.3 per cent . voted ‘yes’ to industrial action. They are asking for extra money to . work on Boxing Day. One source said they would agree to triple pay and a . day off in lieu for working on the bank holiday. Disruption will be worse if members of the RMT - led by Bob Crow - refuse to cross the picket line . Aslef warned that it will take further . action on January 16 and on February 3 and 13 if no agreement is . reached with Tube bosses. Last Christmas, Tube drivers did not receive a special bonus for working Boxing Day. London Underground said Aslef and . other unions had signed up to an agreement that saw them getting higher . salaries and increased leave on the understanding that this would . involve working on some public holidays. Earlier this year it was . announced that Tube drivers would get a £1,800 bonus in return for not . going on strike during the Olympics. The average Briton with a full-time . job earns around £26,000. Tube drivers’ pay is expected to rise to . almost double that during their current four-year pay deal. A spokesman for London mayor Boris . Johnson said: ‘It is appalling and wrong that at a time when many . Londoners are enduring a decline in salary in real terms and rising . living costs that the union are asking for more money for something . already included in their salaries.’ Colin Stanbridge, chief executive of . the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, accused Aslef of ‘holding . London and its businesses to ransom’. Christmas crush: Tube drivers will stage the first of four one-day walkouts on Boxing Day - hitting the shopping plans of hundreds of thousands of people . 'Retailers have . already had one of their toughest years with recent sales figures . showing a decline year-on-year fuelled by poor consumer confidence, . rising unemployment and mild weather. 'The last thing they need now is . disruption on Boxing Day, one of their most important trading dates. 'We . urge Aslef to consider the damage their actions will cause to the London . economy and reconsider their decision.' Walkout: Underground trains sit idle during a previous strike. The overwhelming majority of Aslef members balloted voted in favour of action . Howard Collins, London Underground's Chief Operating Officer, said: 'It is disgraceful for the Aslef leadership to threaten strike action while we are engaged in continuing discussions on this issue. 'The threat of strike action will not achieve anything and I urge Aslef to join us in our commitment to resolve this matter through discussions. 'London Underground has a long-standing agreement with all of its trade unions which cover staff working arrangements on bank holidays, and Boxing Day is included in that agreement. 'However, we have shown good faith in reviewing Boxing Day services so that staffing requirements are lower than when Aslef raised this matter last year, and Aslef should do the same.' A spokesman for Transport for London added: 'The services we have put on in the past on Boxing Day when there has been strike action have kept London moving and less people have come into the capital. 'It is something that is endurable. Their further strikes as the economy is trying to pick up at the start of 2013, are a different order of things. 'This is intended to be as disruptive as possible.'","Drivers demand £366 and a lieu day for December 26 .

Not a single driver breaking the speed limit on the M25 motorway has been issued with a ticket from its new overhead cameras over the past year. A network of 36 digital cameras has been installed along the busy London orbital motorway by the Highways Agency, but the machines are yet to be switched on, according to a report. The agency, which has blamed 'technical and legal difficulties' for the blunder, said it was working with police to solve the problem as a 'matter of urgency'. 'Incompetence': Safety groups hit out at the Highways Agency after it emerged that no tickets have been issued from its network of overhead speeding cameras on the M25 over the past year . According to a report in the Daily Telegraph, the failure emerged when the AOL website tried to identify which camera along the stretch of road had raised the most money in speeding penalties over the year. In fact, it discovered, the cameras - the first of which was installed in 2009 - have failed to catch a single speeding driver. The Highways Agency, which owns the network, said it was yet to receive statutory authority to use the new cameras on the Surrey, Hertfordshire and Essex stretches of the M25. The cameras covering these areas have not even been tested yet, the agency admitted. In parts where it does have permission to put the cameras into use, the agency has been beset by 'technical' difficulties surrounding the upgrade of the old-style machines to the new, digital generation, it said. Enforcement: Cameras have been used to catch speeding drivers on the M25 - one of Europe's busiest motorways - since 1995 . Temporary average-speed cameras monitoring stretches of roadworks along the motorway are understood to be working. A spokesman for the Highways Agency, who was unable to say how much the network of cameras cost or when they would be put into use, said that mandatory speed limits were still enforceable, and that the onus was on drivers to obey them. Cameras have been used to catch drivers . breaking the limit on the route since 1995. Police patrols also enforce . limits on the motorway. Jim Fitzpatrick, Labour's road safety spokesman, described the revelation as 'unbelievable'. 'The M25 is already used as a racetrack by  number of reckless drivers. If there is one place where we need working cameras it is on that stretch of motorway,' he told the newspaper.","Not a single ticket has been issued from the motorway's network of 36 overhead digital cameras over the past year .

Law changes to make sure Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first baby can succeed to the throne are to be rushed through parliament. MPs will meet on Monday to start rewriting 660-year-old laws to ensure that if the royal couple have a girl she will become Queen, even if she has a young brother. Ministers are to prioritise the law change with the urgency usually reserved for anti-terror laws. Just a week after the Duchess of Cambridge left the King Edward VII hospital, ministers published new legislation to ensure their son or daughter becomes monarch . The Succession to the Crown Bill will stop men leapfrogging an older woman in line to the throne. It will also scrap the ban on anyone in line to the throne marrying a Roman Catholic. Ministers had insisted that a deal agreed by Commonwealth countries to change the succession rules last year would be backdated, so there was no need to rush legislation. But barely a week after Kate and William announced they were expecting their first child, the government has published legislation which it hopes to rush through before Christmas. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘This Bill will bring to an end centuries of discrimination against women so that the first born is next in line to the throne, regardless of whether they’re a boy or a girl. ‘I’m delighted that all of the Queen’s realms have agreed to this historic piece of legislation, that will enact in law what we agreed back in 2011 – that if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have a baby girl, she can one day be our Queen even if she has younger brothers. ‘We’re pressing ahead with this as quickly as we can – it’s clearly something the entire country can get behind towards the close of this momentous Jubilee year.’ The four-page Bill states that in future ‘succession to the Crown not to depend on gender’ and rewrites the Treason Act 1351 to replace ‘first son and heir’ to mean ‘eldest child and heir’. Other laws affected include the Bill of Rights, Act of Settlement and the Regency Act 1937. The baby will be third in line to the throne regardless of gender after Prime Minister David Cameron agreed a deal with other Commonwealth countries to change the rules on  the royal line of succession which means male heirs will no longer be given priority. This means that in the 15 other countries where the Queen is head of state the rules must be changed. It had been feared there could be a constitutional crisis if the Royal couple had a baby girl before the law was changed. But today's announcement that the . Duchess of Cambridge is expecting the couple's first child - third in line to the throne - has come after the deal was agreed. In . October 2011, David Cameron announced that the 16 Commonwealth . countries where the Queen is head of state had agreed to give female . royals the same rights of succession as their brothers. 'Put . simply, if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were to have a little . girl, that girl would one day be our queen,' Mr Cameron said. Under . the ancient rules of male primogeniture, first born royal daughters in . direct line to the throne were leapfrogged by their younger male . siblings. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the legislation would be passed 'as quickly as we can' The principle was criticised and widely viewed as outdated and discriminatory. The current law of male primogeniture only allows Elizabeth II to be queen because she did not have any brothers. Moves towards constitutional change gathered pace in the wake of the Duke and Duchess’s wedding in April 2011 in anticipation they would produce an offspring. Mr Cameron had previously warned it would take time due to on-going negotiations with the Commonwealth countries where the Queen is also head of state, but at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in October 2011 he confirmed the changes would go ahead. Downing Street said any attempt to alter the law would be a 'difficult and complex matter', with parallel legislation needed in all such Commonwealth nations. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's . first child will push Prince Harry into fourth place in the line of . succession to the throne - even if they have a girl. Prince William and Kate's child would move into third place, become more important than Harry and not be subject to the centuries-old law of primogeniture, which puts male heirs ahead of women. He or she will leapfrog Harry by being be the first born of first-in-line Prince Charles's first son. It is anticipated that Harry and . Pippa Middleton could be asked to be the child's godparents, if the . royal couple follow the tradition appointing the best man and maid of . honour from their wedding. Ministers have made clear the changes will apply from October 28, 2011 – the date of the Commonwealth summit where the countries agreed the plans. So close: The Duchess of Cambridge, (centre), Prince William (right) and Prince Harry (left) wave as they pass the Houses of Parliament during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant in June . The change needs to be legislated for . in the Commonwealth nations of the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, . Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Grenada, Belize, St . Christopher and Nevis, St Lucia, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, St . Vincent and the Grenadines and Papua New Guinea. But this is regarded as assured.","A week after Duchess of Cornwall left hospital, minister publish Bill .

The writers behind Game Change are working on a sequel about Mitt Romney’s failed bid for the White House - with a film already in the works. Authors Mark Halperin and John Heilemann are writing Double Down: Game Change 2012 to dissect what went wrong with the Republicans during the election. It will be published in Fall next year with the film coming some time after. Mitt and Ann Romney: The writers behind Game Change are working on a sequel about his failed bid for the White House - with a film already in the works . Julianne Moore won an Emmy for Best Actress in a Mini-Series or Movie after playing Sarah Palin in Game Change . The book and film will likely make the Romney camp squirm as Game Change made the Republican party’s 2008 campaign appear riven with conflict. It was also harsh on former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and made it seem like she was completely unqualified for the role. Her equivalent in this year’s election was Paul Ryan who some have claimed hijacked Romney’s campaign with his economic ideology. Game Change 2012 will also lead to speculation about who will play the main characters. The original had an impressive cast including Julianne Moore who won an Emmy for Best Actress in a Mini-Series or Movie for the lead role. Ed Harris played Republican Presidential candidate John McCain whilst Woody Harrelson was Republican strategist Steve Schmidt. It is unknown yet who will play Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan in the forthcoming Double Down movie . In total Game Change won four Emmys including the coveted Outstanding Mini-Series or Movie. It was directed by a Jay Roach-directed and written by Danny Strong and according to the Hollywood Reporter, which first reported the news, both are likely to return for the sequel. Whilst the original Game Change was a hit for HBO, Republicans were outraged by it. Palin was deeply unimpressed and sent out her own video response to fans titled ‘Game Change We Can Believe In’, a pun on Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign slogan. In a note she said that the film ‘lapsed into a tired routine of manipulating facts and omitting key parts of Governor Palin’s story in order to push a biased agenda and drive ratings.’ Palin later attacked it for being ‘based on a false narrative’ and said that she didn’t care about being ‘in the good graces of Hollywood's Team Obama.’ Both John McCain and Sarah Palin were critical of the original Game Change which documented their 2008 bid for the White House . Ed Harris played John McCain in the Emmy winning film Game Change, while Sarah Palin was played by Oscar-winner Julianne Moore . In an interview McCain has said that even though he was portrayed sympathetically, he did not like how his character used so many swear words and that Palin was made to look bad. He said: ‘I don't understand, even in the tough world of politics, why there continues to be such an assault on a good and decent person. ‘I admired and respect her. I'm proud of our campaign....I thought she was the most qualified person.’ Penguin publisher Ann Godoff said in a statement: ‘John Heilemann and Mark Halperin reinvented the campaign narrative with Game Change. ‘Their new book Double Down will, of course, break news; but more importantly, it will create the lasting story of the 2012 race for the presidency.""","Double Down: Game Change 2012 will dissect what went wrong with the Republicans during the recent election race .

Britain's most prolific church lead theft gang were today jailed for a total of more than two decades after they left the Church of England with a £1million repair bill at 20 churches across three counties. The gang from Lithuania, who were based in the cathedral city of Lincoln, struck across the East Midlands and were only caught when police stopped a vehicle laden with stolen lead on the A46. They made almost £70,000 from selling stolen lead over nine months in 2011, but six of the gang were arrested after being linked to the offences through sales of stolen metal to recycling yards. Scroll down for video . Lithuanian gang: Andrius Cereska (left), Audrius Kvedaras (centre) and Tadas Andruska (right) struck across the East Midlands and were only caught when police stopped a vehicle laden-with stolen lead on the A46 . Involved: The gang, which included Nerijus Razma (left) and Vidas Andruska (right), made almost £70,000 from selling stolen lead over nine months in 2011, but six were eventually arrested. Vitalijus Vilkys is not pictured . Some of the metal had traces of ‘smart . water’ which allowed officers to identify from where the lead had been . stolen - and police believe they were also responsible for a number of . other raids. DNA evidence left behind on a cigarette butt and a beer can at one church, along with evidence from automatic number plate recognition cameras, also led to some of the gang being identified. Investigators believe the gang were the main reason for the high number of church thefts last year in Lincolnshire, when 186 religious buildings were hit - making it the second most affected county. Raids have fallen 90 per cent since their arrests, with just 19 churches suffering lead theft in 2012. Between 2007 and 2011 over 14,000 cases of church lead theft were reported across the country, costing the Church £32million. That compared with just 20 thefts a year between 2000 and 2004. Repair job: One of the churches targeted by the Lithuanian gang in Lincolnshire was St Nicholas in Fulbeck . Damaged: St Laurence in Norwell was one of the two churches in Nottinghamshire that was targeted . Although most of the churches targeted by the gang were in Lincolnshire, others in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire were also raided, Stephen Lowne, prosecuting, told Lincoln Crown Court. 'The value of the lead was but a small proportion of the cost inflicted upon the churches concerned' Stephen Lowne, prosecuting . ‘The value of the lead was but a small proportion of the cost inflicted upon the churches concerned,’ he said. ‘These churches were fairly isolated and some of them did not have houses nearby. 'In some cases it was some time before the thefts were discovered, allowing the ingress of rainwater. Extensive infrastructure damage was caused to some of the churches.’ The crime became so prevalent that the Ecclesiastical Insurance Group, which provides insurance to Church of England churches, restricted claims to £5,000 per church - allowing one claim per year. Problematic: Among the buildings hit in August last year was the St James the Greater Church in Little Dalby, near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire . Andrius Cereska, 30, Audrius Kvedavas, 30, and Tadas Andruska, 36, all of Lincoln, all admitted conspiring to steal lead belonging to the Church of England between January and September 2011. Theft: Fifteen of the targeted churches were in Lincolnshire, including St Margaret's in Quadring . The trio were each jailed for four years. Meanwhile, Vidas Andruska, 34, also of Lincoln,  was found guilty of the same charge after a trial and was jailed for seven years. Vitalijus Vilkys, 27, also of Lincoln, admitted handling stolen lead and was sentenced to six months imprisonment suspended for two years and 180 hours community punishment. Nerijus Razma, 23, of Lincoln, pleaded guilty to a single theft charge and was jailed for 22 months. Passing sentence, Judge Michael Heath told the gang: ‘These thefts caused serious financial consequences. The overall costs to the 20 churches, I am told, is in the region of £1million. ‘It is a great deal of money. It is very important and the distress felt by Christians at the desecration of their scared places of divine worship should not be underestimated. ‘You lot could not care less about those feelings. All you were interested in was stealing lead, weighing it in, and making money.’ Among the buildings hit in August last year was the St James the Greater Church in Little Dalby, near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. Retired vicar Canon Michael Covington . called for more co-ordinated action after an estimated £50,000-worth of . lead was removed from the Grade II-listed church. Tarpaulin: St Nicholas in Lutton was another of the 15 churches targeted by the gang in Lincolnshire . 'The convictions and jail terms represented the biggest success in the fight against heritage crime in Britain to date' DI Keith Blakey, Lincolnshire Police . Two other village churches in Leicestershire, St James in Ab Kettleby, and All Saints in Asfordby, were struck, along with two in Nottinghamshire - St Andrew's in Asgarby, and St Laurence in Norwell. The 15 other churches hit were in Lincolnshire. Reverend Gary Morgan, from St Peter and St Paul's church in the Lincolnshire village of Algarkirk, said there had been two previous lead thefts at his church, which he admitted was ‘very dispiriting.’ Rebuild effort: St Peter's in Thorpe St Peter, Lincolnshire, was also targeted by the thieves who made a fortune . The churches in Lincolnshire were St Nicholas in Fulbeck, All Saints in Holton-cum-Beckering, St Peter and St Laurence in Wickenby, St Botolph in Newton, St Mary's and All Saints in Swarby, St Nicholas in Walcot, St Mary's in Sutterton, St Peter and St Paul in Algarkirk, St Peter & St Paul in Gosberton, St Nicholas in Lutton, St Margaret’s in Quadring, St Mary's and All Saints in Kirkby Underwood, St Leodegars in Wyberton, All Saints in Hougham, and St Peter's in Thorpe St Peter. 'Since the arrests of these men there has been a massive drop in the number of church lead theft cases in this area' DI Keith Blakey, Lincolnshire Police . Detective Inspector Keith Blakey of Lincolnshire Police, who led the probe, said ‘The convictions and jail terms represented the biggest success in the fight against heritage crime in Britain to date. ‘These thieves targeted some of the most important heritage sites in the heart of our rural communities, causing huge amounts of damage to religious buildings and leading to a great deal of upset among congregations.

Free speech campaigners have hailed a vote by the House of Lords to scrap a  draconian law that made it a crime simply to insult someone. The controversial legislation led to countless arrests of ordinary people for making jokes and expressing opinions about  religion and sexuality. An amendment to strike out the term 'insult' by Lord Dear, a crossbencher and former West Midlands chief constable, was backed by 150 votes to 54 . Section 5 of the Public Order Act criminalised ‘insulting’ words and behaviour – without defining what the term meant. Critics warned that over- zealous police and prosecutors  were abusing the law, leading to ludicrous scenarios such as the conviction of a teenager for saying ‘woof’ to two dogs. An amendment to strike out the term ‘insult’ by Lord Dear, a crossbencher and former West Midlands chief constable, was backed by 150 votes to 54 late on Tuesday. The move was backed despite the Government and Labour peers opposing the change. Liberal Democrats banded with rebel lords from across the parties and crossbench peers to vote for the change. Lord Dear said: ‘We must never lose sight of our basic constitutional freedoms within the law which are so important in any civilised country. ‘That’s why the vote was so important in upholding and enhancing one of those basic freedoms.’ Simon Calvert, of The Christian Institute and campaign director for Reform Section 5, said: ‘We are delighted the House of Lords has voted to enhance free speech for everyone by reforming Section 5. ‘The vote will encourage everyone who believes in robust debate, especially those who feel free speech has become less free in recent years. ‘We now wait to hear whether the Government will try to overturn this vote in the Commons.’ The amendment was passed by the House of Lords as part of the Crime and Courts Bill. It will still need to go through the House of Commons for approval, however, and will need government backing to become law. A senior MP told the Mail Theresa May had become hesitant to change the law following the 'plebgate' row involving former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell . Last night, the Home Office said it was ‘considering’ the arguments for change and ‘will reflect on the Lords’ decision’. A spokesman added: ‘The  Government supported the retention of Section 5 as it  currently stands, because we believe it is wrong to swear at police officers.’ The Home Office launched a consultation on repealing Section 5 in January, but no decision has yet been reached about whether it will back the change. One senior MP told the Mail the Home Office had taken an unusually long time to deliberate and had ‘become hesitant’ to change the law following the ‘plebgate’ row involving former International Development  Secretary Andrew Mitchell. The MP said: ‘Until Mitchell’s plebgate, we thought the Home Office and police could work this out and agree to drop it. But Theresa May did not want to be seen undermining police in the wake of that.’ Mr Mitchell was accused of swearing at police officers outside Downing Street when he was asked to get off his bicycle. But the intervention last week of the Crown Prosecution Service will heap pressure on the Government to back the change. Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said the law could be ‘safely’ amended while still protecting vulnerable  people from harassment under existing laws. Police used Section 5 to pursue the following cases .","Section 5 of the Public Order Act criminalised ‘insulting’ words and behaviour .

High-flier: Former BBC director-general Mark Thompson was among executives who clocked up over £1million on flights to the U.S. over a seven-month period . The BBC spent more than £1 million on flights to America in the space of seven months this year, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, . Executives including former director-general Mark Thompson clocked up the massive bill flying both business and economy class for meetings and to make programmes. In total, the Corporation’s U.S. flights bill came to £1,135,726 between April 1 and October 31. That works out at an average of £162,246 per month, or around £40,000 per week. The new figures show 1,026 tickets were bought, though the BBC has admitted that final total could be even higher. With around 20,000 BBC employees in total, an average of one member of staff in every 20 flew to the U.S. at some point during the seven-month period. The figures do not include the cost of sending 94 assorted staff to the U.S. for last month’s presidential election. In its FoI response, the BBC said the bill covers tickets booked for staff, contributors and equipment — but doesn’t include any flights that may have been booked directly by staff or guests and then claimed back. As the BBC is not legally obliged to reveal full details of how it spends the £3.7 billion it is given each year through the licence fee, it is not possible to name every staff member who flew to the U.S. between April and October. Big spenders: The corporation's flights averaged £162,246 per month, or around £40,000 per week . However, last week the BBC released details for the first quarter of the financial year for its best-paid 100 employees. This showed that Thompson, who quit in September to become chief executive of The New York Times, took a return business-class flight to San Francisco in June for £5,789. Also flying to California in June was American-born Ralph Rivera, the £309,000-a-year BBC director of future media, whose return ticket cost £6,213.09. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC has offices across the UK and all over the world. In addition, staff have to represent the organisation at international conferences and events that happen worldwide. ‘Fuel and flight costs are rising, but we continue to try and reduce our expenditure in this area wherever possible.’","FoI request reveals executives, including Mark thompson, ran up huge bill .

The Staffie-cross was found abandoned wandering the streets of Birmingham by the dog warden in the summer. He was taken to Birmingham Dogs' Home weighing little more than 5kg, the weight of a healthy cat, and he was so thin horrified staff could easily count his ribs. Starved: Staffie-cross Sammi was so this his ribs were clearly visible after he was left abandoned on the streets . Picture of health: But he now looks full of life after being nursed back to a normal weight by staff at Birmingham Dogs' Home . But after months of dedicated care, 12-month-old Sammi has been nursed back to health and delighted kennel workers have managed to find him a new home just in time for the festive season. Sammi, who now weighs a healthy 12.5kg, has happily settled into his new home with owner Pauline Soloman. Alayna Warner, who looked after Sammi at the home, said: 'Sammi was in a real state when he was brought to us - he was very nervous and so thin. 'We think someone had just abandoned him on the street after deciding they didn't want him. 'The poor thing was so think - it was heart-breaking. He was very nervous at first, but obviously a friendly dog, as it wasn't long before his cheeky personality started to shine through. 'He's now back up to full health and has settled in really well with his new owner.' Abandoned: Sammi weighed the same as a cat when he was found wandering the streets of Birmingham . Visible: Nurses at the dogs' home were shocked at how they could see Sammi's ribs when he first arrived .

New owner Pauline said: 'Sammi is a lovely dog and I'm so glad I've been able to offer him a loving home. 'He was so skinny when he was taken into the home, but fortunately, he's happy and healthy now.

'A lot of people don't research the cost involved, and just throw their pet out on the streets when they get bored with it. 'There has been a notable decrease in the number of people coming to us to collect their dogs. 'It used to be the case that about half of our dogs had gone missing, and people phoned around looking for them before coming to collect them from us - but in the last 12 months, fewer and fewer owners are coming to us to be reunited with their pets. 'People even bring dogs into us with the most ludicrous reasons why they can't keep them - one woman told us she didn't expect the dog to bark, and several people have brought dogs to us saying they didn't realise their puppies would grow so big. 'It's great that Sammi has found a home, and we hope that all our dogs will be as lucky as him.'

A desperate university student on her way to an exam risked her own life and sparked chaos on a railway line when her train set off without her and she sprinted a mile down the track to catch it . The 34-year old Lancashire woman decided to get off and buy a ticket at a railway station kiosk after her bank card was declined by a conductor's chip and pin machine. But as she was about to get back on the train it pulled out of Burnley Central in Lancashire - and she realised she had left her dissertation and other revision papers on board. Risky business: The unnamed woman chaed the train for a mile along these tracks after her train left Burnley Central station without her . As the train set off, the unnamed woman panicked, leapt off the platform and ran onto the line after the train in the hope of catching up with it at the next stop Burnley Barracks. But her amazing chase along the track and across the 15-arch 1848 Burnley viaduct caused chaos on the line forcing another train coming the other way to grind a halt. Ralway staff eventually stopped her and called police. She was later quizzed on suspicion of trespassing on a railway line and issued with a £50 fixed penalty notice. The incident caused disruption on the Northern Rail service between Colne and Blackpool and trains were stopped for around ten minutes . The incident took place at noon yesterday after the student had boarded the Colne to Blackpool train at Nelson to go to Preston where it was believed she was studying in the city. Lancashire Police confirmed the woman had tried to buy a £10 return ticket on board the train for the hour long journey but her bank card had been declined so she was advised by the conductor to get off at the next stop and buy a ticket from the kiosk. Disruption: The woman was issued with a £50 fixed penalty notice for trespassing following the incident which caused a train travelling in the other direction to stop . Inspector Phil Hutchinson, from Lancashire Police, said: 'She was on her way to university to sit an exam and some of her property was still on the train. 'It is absolutely one of the most dangerous things people can do. From our point of view, it not only puts yourself in danger, but my staff as well. 'We have a duty to protect people and make sure they are safe, but I have to deploy my officers onto the live tracks if someone gets on. Sprint: The railway viaduct the student ran across while she was chasing her train to get to an end of term exam . 'People don't often think about the additional consequences. If a train had hit her she could have been killed.' A Northern Rail spokesman said: 'We ask that all passengers boarding at a station that has an open ticket office or a ticket vending machine, to purchase tickets before getting on the train. 'This particular passenger made the decision to leave the train at Burnley Central to purchase a ticket after her card was declined on-board. 'We would like to remind passengers to take their belongings with them when they leave the train to reduce incidents such as this happening again. 'Not only did the woman's actions cause delay but she also put own safety at risk by trespassing on the tracks.' Passenger Sharon Ellis, 27, from Nelson, said: 'I've been in a situation like that myself but I just buy a ticket on the train. I don't know what possessed her but I bet she feels a bit stupid now.' Percy Lane, 68, from Colne, said: 'It's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard. She could have got herself killed. It's ridiculous to cause such chaos.' A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'BTP officers were called to the line close to Burnley Central railway station after a report of a woman trespassing. 'The incident was reported to us at 12.11pm and was also attended by Lancashire Police. 'Officers subsequently spoke to the 34-year-old woman and issued her with a £50 fixed penalty notice for trespassing.'","Student got on tracks and chased train for a mile after it left without her .

A judge has credited a knife-wielding thug for 'taking care not to inflict life threatening injuries' when he stabbed his victim five times in a nightclub attack. Hoopang Wong, 25, who has two previous convictions for possessing a knife, stabbed Karlos Fredericks three times in his right thigh, once in his left thigh and once in his left armpit. Recorder Michael Hunter, sitting at Kingston Crown Court, sentenced Wong to seven years in jail for wounding with intent. Credit: Recorder Michael Hunter, pictured right, gave Hoopang Wong, left, credit for taking care not to inflict life threatening injuries during an attack, for which he jailed him for seven years . He told him he would be 'failing to protect the public' if he did not pass a substantial custodial sentence, but gave him credit for using the knife in the way he did. He said: 'I take into account four of the wounds and two of the deep wounds were deliberately made by you on the legs. 'I am therefore giving you credit for the fact that when you used the knife the way you did you were taking care not to inflict life threatening injuries, although I am aware that such injuries can cause death. 'I can only hope that when you are released from prison you will use your potential and never return to prison again.' The court heard the victim had surgery and stitches above his left eyebrow and has ongoing issues with feeling and movement in his legs. Wong attacked his victim with a flick knife on May 20 this year at the Oceana nightclub in Clarence Street, Kingston, Surrey. He claimed during his trial that Mr Fredericks had attacked him, and after finding the blade on the floor of the club, he accidentally cut the victim in self defence. Mr Fredericks received four cuts to his legs, including one down to the bone, and a fifth to the chest. Wong was found guilty of the stabbing on November 12. On Tuesday Mr Hunter told Wong: 'I would be failing to protect the public if I did not pass upon you a substantial custodial sentence.' Attack: The club where Wong attacked Mr Fredericks and later claimed he had used the knife in self defence . The judge accepted that Wong had not intended to kill Mr Fredericks as the majority of injuries were to the legs. But . he also pointed to the fact Wong, from Northolt in Middlesex, had two . previous convictions for possessing a knife, serving an eight week . prison sentence for the second offence in 2007. Mr Hunter said: 'I have to take into account the fact that you have previous convictions for possession of a rather similar knife, and I'm sure you would have been warned in the past if you were to use such a knife again. Defending Wong, Nathalie Carter . described her client as a 'warm, loyal and sensitive young man,' with . aspirations of becoming a tattoo artist. She also submitted letters to Mr Hunter, written by Wong and members of his family. Mr Hunter said: 'I have read your very well constructed letter, and I take into account your expressions of remorse. 'But I could have given you much more credit if you had pleaded guilty and not blamed the victim. 'You have robbed me of the opportunity of giving you a greater discount.' The femoral artery, pictured right, is a large artery in the thigh which runs through the groin and supplies blood to the legs. Due to the need for it to supply blood to the muscles of the legs it is one of the largest arteries in the body and often has the highest blood pressure. It is particularly vulnerable due to how close it is to the surface of the skin and, if punctured, the victim can bleed to death in a matter of minutes. The axillary artery meanwhile is a large blood vessel which conveys blood to the armpit, the thorax and the upper limb. If the axillary artery is cut, a person can bleed to death in one minute or less.","Hoopang Wong, 25, stabbed victim Karlos Fredericks four times in the legs and once in his armpit .

Eric Stamatin was hunting for crayfish behind his backyard in Troy, Michigan, with his cousin Andrew Gainariu when they spotted what they thought was a rock in the water. On closer inspection, the boys noticed a large hole in the middle of the object and wondered if it might be something else. Fossil fun: Eric Stamatin (left) and his cousin Andrew Gainariu with the 13,000-year-old mastodon bone they found while hunting for crayfish in a stream in Michigan . But when they took it home to Eric's mother, she guessed it was probably just a cow's bone and it sat on a shelf in the dining room for months. It was only when she finally contacted a paleontologist in November they realised they had in fact found a second vertebrae in the spinal column of an American mastodon. 'Oh my gosh, we were liked psyched,' said Eric, from Shelby Township, after learning of his discovery, which he made in a branch of the Clinton River in June. Thought it belonged to a cow: The bone was a second vertebrae in the spinal column of a mastodon (pictured) which roamed America until their extinction around 10,000 years ago . Mastodons lived from about the Oligocene of the Paleogene period, about 30 million years ago, in North and central America until about 10,000 years ago. Although similar to elephants and woolly mammoths, they are not that closely related. They are thought to have become extinct due to nomadic hunters and an abrupt climate change when temperatures plunged to glacial conditions. 'I thought it was a rock at first, but a . couple minutes later I looked more at it. I didn't think it was a . dinosaur bone, but I wasn't sure.' The mastodon, which resembles a woolly mammoth although not closely related, roamed the plains of North and Central America until their extinction around 10,000 years ago. John Zawiskie, a geologist and paleontologist at the Cranbrook Institute of Science, rushed over to Eric's house to tell them the news. He told CNN: 'Every once in a while - by construction workers or exploring 11-year-old boys and girls - something like this comes to the forefront and reminds us of the incredible history of Earth's landscape.' Eric is now preparing to give his science class their 'coolest' show-and-tell ever. 'I feel really special,' he said.

A teenager who murdered his mother by stabbing her 94 times after he became fascinated with knives has been jailed for life. Kieren Smith, 17, who was named for the first time yesterday after reporting restrictions were lifted by the judge, killed mum Leah Whittle in a ‘ferocious attack’ at her Dorset home on July 21,then claimed a gang of ‘mystery men from Yorkshire’ were to blame. Jailing him for life yesterday Judge Guy Boney told Smith he would serve at least 15 years before he could be considered for parole. 17-year-old Kieren Smith, pictured left, has been jailed for life after . murdering his mother Leah Whittle, 44, pictured right, in a 'ferocious . attack' The judge said: 'You have been convicted of a deeply shocking and really utterly dreadful offence - that of killing your own mother in as brutal a way as can be imagined. 'You have cut short by many years the life of the very person who gave you life in the first place and expressing your crime in that way tells everyone the true horror of what you did.' Smith ‘rained down’ 94 blows in a ‘ferocious’ attack lasting over a minute with a knife he had bought on the internet, Judge Boney said. He said: 'For the whole of that period it seems you were completely blacked out and engrossed in one thing - killing your own mother.' The eight-day trial heard Smith attacked his 42-year-old mother in their flat in Benville Road, Weymouth, Dorset, before he told police she had been killed by drug-dealers. The youth turned on his mother, stabbing her with at least one knife in an attack so sudden she had 'little chance' to defend herself. He inflicted knife wounds across her head, back and front in the two-bedroomed flat they shared, jurors were told. Investigation: Forensics carrying out their search for clues at the Dorset flat where Smith murdered his mother in July . The court heard Smith had been expelled . from school at the age of 14 and had spent the last two years alone in . his room watching DVDs which fuelled his fascination with knives. Judge Boney said: 'Your life revolved around watching DVDs alone in your room with an absence of emotional engagement. 'It is from that diet of constant DVDs that your fascination of knives came from.' The judge told Smith: 'That kind of unhappy and unfulfilling life that you lived must, in fairness, be put against your background, that your parents separated when you were little more than a baby and your family life was almost non-existent.' He said Smith had not shown a 'smidgen of remorse', although accepted he was not by nature an emotional man. Never known: Smith's barrister told the court it was 'impossible' to give an explanation for why he carried out the crime . Nicholas Haggan QC, defending, said Smith’s motive for the killing was unknown. He said: 'It’s always difficult to give an explanation and in this particular case it’s impossible. One will never know why the defendant did what he did. 'This is not an ordinary case; we accept it’s very unusual for a young man to kill his mother.' Mr Haggan told how Smith, who has an IQ of 72 which puts him in the lowest four per cent of the population, was excluded from school after becoming disruptive, leading to drink and drugs problems. He said the defendant had become isolated and shunned contact with others to avoid getting emotionally hurt. Denial: Smith claimed a 'gang of mystery men' had come down from Yorkshire to murder his mother . He said: 'For the two years prior to the killing, the defendant spent it alone in his room watching DVDs. He led a very lonely existence. 'He is a very lonely and unhappy individual who finds it very difficult or impossible to express his true emotions - he has told us again and again he finds it impossible to cry.' Mr Haggan added that Smith had shown little remorse and he believed his client may have blocked out the killing. Divorced mum-of-three Ms Whittle was not found slumped against the hallway wall of her home until the following day in July. Forensics: Smith told his friends cuts on his arms had come from scaling down a drainpipe after climbing out of a window, but traces of his blood were found in the flat . Experts believe Ms Whittle was 'immobilised' early on in a horrific killing at her own son’s hands. A blade wielded by Smith severed her spinal cord, a post mortem of her bloodstained body revealed. There were no injuries on her arms or hands, suggesting she was rendered unconscious early in the attack. Smith then took money from his mother’s handbag, changed his trousers and left through the window. Smith told his three friends - all girls - that cuts on his hands were from scaling down the drainpipe. But forensics experts found traces of his blood inside the flat. Giving evidence, the girls recalled Smith’s socks had been soaked in blood, and that despite the terrible events he had acted as if nothing had happened. Smith rang police to report his mother’s murder around 12 hours after she died, but turned his phone off and took the battery and SIM card out after giving the address. The murder weapon has never been recovered. Smith - who could not be named for legal reasons before his conviction - said he threw the knife the gang used into bushes as he fled. Richard Smith QC, prosecuting, told the jury that the defendant, who was 16 at the time, had an interest in knives and had a temper but said the reason for the murder would never be known. Smith had denied the killing and said that men came down from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, to execute his mother because his brother had got into trouble over a drug debt. He told friends and the police that he had seen a man or men attack his mother through a bathroom door and when they left he bolted the door, took some money from his mother’s purse and escaped through a window and down a drainpipe. Ms Whittle had moved back to Dorset after living in Yorkshire until her marriage broke down.The court heard that her relationship with her son was often less than harmonious but the teenager told police the pair were close. Detective Inspector Marcus Hester, of Dorset Police, said: 'This case involved a particularly horrific and sustained attack on a woman who was unable to defend herself. 'This is a very tragic case where a young man, through his own violent actions, has killed his mother. 'He now has to face the consequences of these actions as well as to live with the loss of his mother. 'Our sympathy is with Leah Whittle’s family and friends who are still coming to terms with their loss.'","Teenager Kieren Smith murdered his mother by stabbing her 94 times .

A teen mother laid a honeytrap for a man trying to woo her by saying she was having a bath at home before letting him in - where he was subjected to an attack by thugs, a court heard. Zoey Tomlinson, 18, of Gorton, Manchester, was annoyed by the 20-year-old man's text messages and asked friends to warn him off - but the thugs went too far, Manchester Crown Court was told.

A madam has been convicted of running a 'high class' brothel from luxury penthouse flats close to the waterside homes of Premier League footballers. Suzanna Symington, 29, recruited girls to work at two apartments in the exclusive Ocean Village Marina, in Southampton, Hampshire. She provided them with accommodation, security cameras and a video intercom along with contraceptives and a variety of sex toys. Prosecutor David Jenkins told Southampton Crown Court the 'very high class set up' offered a variety of services from escorting to full sex. Judge Nigel Pascoe sentenced her to seven months in prison, suspended for a year, and fined her £250. He told her: 'In life there are sometimes turning points. 'You may like to consider that not going to prison today maybe the turning point in your life - but that is a matter for you.' Prices at the brothel, known as Elite Devine Honeys, ranged from £80 for 'girlfriend experiences' to £2,000 for a full weekend. Symington started off as a prostitute herself, working under the name Lucy Devine. But her business was so successful she decided to expand into two flats, taking a cut of the girls' profits to pay the rent and utility bills. She had dreamed of becoming a millionaire with a home in the sun, a swimming pool and even a book deal chronicling how she made her fortune, the court heard. But police raided her brothel after four months in August last year, during which time the business is believed to have made almost £34,000. Officers found a purse containing £13,410 in cash and a quantity of amphetamine. Exclusive: Symington built up her business after becoming a prostitute herself when her gambler boyfriend left her with debts . Ocean village: The area is known to be home to Premier League footballers, although there is no suggestion any used the brothel . Symington, of Southampton, said in police interview the drugs were for personal use to help her lose weight. The court heard she began working as a prostitute when her gambler boyfriend left her with crippling debts. Symington was convicted of controlling or managing a brothel for the use of prostitution and possessing criminal property. The madam also admitted possessing a class B drug. Aspirations: The court heard how Symington had dreams of becoming a millionaire with a home in the sun and even a book deal . Toby Long, defending, said Symington had been 'disarmingly' honest and had co-operated with police. He said her former boyfriend had all but coerced her into opening the brothels and had taken much of the profits she was making for himself. Symington sat motionless in a figure-hugging black suit with animal print collar and cuffs throughout the court hearing. She only flashed a smile when an online advert describing her as 'a young dark haired babe' who was 'perfect and perky' was read out. Ocean Village is a luxurious development, with bars, restaurants, an arthouse cinema and a marina housing dozens of expensive yachts. Houses on the development are regularly occupied by Premier League footballers from the nearby Southampton FC. There is no suggestion that any of those players used the brothel.","Madam Suzanna Symington ran 'high class' brothel .

Will Self and Peter Hitchens clashed during an electric episode of Question Time last night as they expressed their strong views on the decriminalisation of drugs. The controversial author and former heroin addict told the Mail on Sunday journalist to 'take a chill pill' during their furious arguments on the BBC One programme. Mr Self, who once snorted heroin on the then-prime minister John Major's plane, argued that drug use should be legalised in order to focus on treating addicts. But Mr Hitchens responded that his claims were based on 'propaganda'. Scroll down to watch . Fight!: A furious row erupted on Question Time last night. From left to right writer Will Self, Lord Bilimoria, co-founder of Cobra Beer, Tory Justine Greening, international development secretary and the Mail on Sunday's Peter Hitchens . The panellists, who were joined in Bristol by minister Justine Greening, Labour's Stella Creasy and beer magnate Lord Bilimoria, were speaking in the wake of calls to set up a royal commission into the possible decriminalisation of drugs. The suggestion has opened another crack in the Coalition after David Cameron was quick to dismiss the idea but Nick Clegg urged him to show 'courage' and 'tell the truth' about the need for reform. Mr Hitchens is a staunch conservative who has repeatedly spoken out about the need to crack down on drug use and recently published a book on the topic. Mr Self, by contrast, has opened up about his own struggle with drug addiction, and is a strong supporter of reform to current legislation on drugs. He admitted snorting a line of heroin along the side of the wash basin as he flew with John Major's press team on an election campaign flight from London to the East Midlands in April 1997. Despite initially denying the claim, the writer later admitted going to the toilet during the flight to snort, saying: 'So I was smacked out on the Prime Minister's jet - big deal.' Ms Greening, the International Development Secretary, began the discussion by arguing that the current laws were working well as she claimed that the number of drug addicts was at a record low. Passion: Mr Hitchens and Mr Self have both been outspoken on the topic of drug legislation . Fan: Student Tom Williams was one of many viewers who welcomed the aggressive clash . Not keen: MP Chris Bryant was less impressed with the high-octane argument on Question Time . Mr Self broke in to say, 'Compared to what, 1630?', prompting appreciative laughter from his rival Mr Hitchens. He then launched a fierce attack on the Conservative MP's comments, saying: 'I don't think you know anything about it, Justine - I get that strong feeling that you actually know nothing about it.' The author went on to claim that the majority of drug users were healthy and otherwise law-abiding and that government intervention should be targeted to addicts - but Mr Hitchens unsurprisingly took issue with his argument. 'You've had a very long go, I think it's time somebody else said something intelligent,' the columnist said. 'We have decriminalised drugs in this country - if the police can even be bothered with someone caught in possession of cannabis, the most likely treatment is something called a ""cannabis warning"", which was invented by the police without even asking Parliament, which means you are let off.' When asked why the Home Affairs Select Committee had called for an investigation into decriminalisation if drugs were effectively legal anyway, Mr Hitchens pointed to the effect of international legalisation efforts. 'They want a royal commission because there is a very very powerful and well-financed international campaign to legalise drugs so that various wicked people can make very large sums of money out of selling them to the population,' he said. Head-to-head: Other panellists were left as bystanders to the fiery clashes between the outspoken pair . Panel: The pair were joined by (left to right) Lord Bilimoria, Justine Greening, David Dimbleby and Stella Creasy . But Mr Self ridiculed Mr Hitchens' call for stronger enforcement of the law, asking if he knew how many people were currently in possession of illegal narcotics. 'I've no idea, how would I know?', Mr Hitchens replied. He agreed that it would be impossible to jail all drug users, but pointed out: 'The point of having a proper criminal law is not to put people in prison, but to deter people from committing stupid crimes.' Showing his irritation at his rival's arguments, the journalist muttered: 'It's so simple, anyone could answer that - almost.' Repeating his claim that drugs have been effectively decriminalised for the past four decades, Mr Hitchens said: 'Until this point sinks in, we can't have an intelligent discussion... people need to deal with some facts on this, instead of propaganda.' Chairman David Dimbleby replied, 'We can't have a one-man discussion,' and asked Ms Creasy to respond to the suggestion that the UK should 'go down the Portuguese route' by focussing on treatment. Portugal's example was explicitly singled out by the select committee, who pointed to the fact that users of heroin and cocaine are offered rehabilitation rather than punished as a possible model for British drugs law. After another question from the audience on the topic, Mr Hitchens was so keen to display his passion that Mr Self joked: 'Take a chill pill, Peter.' The animosity between the two men did not go unnoticed by their fellow panellists. Ms Creasy, the shadow minister for crime prevention, called for a national discussion on drugs, 'with perhaps even Mr Self and Mr Hitchens taking part in that debate at the same time as each other'. 'Pity the poor chairman,' Mr Dimbleby quipped. But Mr Hitchens was not the only panellist to face a tongue-lashing from the famously acerbic Mr Self. When Lord Bilimoria, who founded the company which makes Cobra Beer, said he worried about the possibility of his children becoming addicted to drugs, the author said: 'My biggest fear is that my children become alcoholics, but you got a peerage for flogging beer.' Twitter users joked about the clash between the journalist and the novelist - student Tom Williams wrote: 'Why don't we just have a #bbcqt edition of Gladiators with Hitchens and Self beating each other off podiums with big cushions on sticks?' However, not all viewers were so delighted by the fiery exchanges, as Labour MP Chris Bryant tweeted: 'Oh god. Drugs with Hitchens and Self. Might have to go to bed.'

A hero tree surgeon has spoken of how he saved a man from being savagely beaten after confronting the thug while dressed as a caveman. Courageous Karl Stephenson, 30, leapt into action wearing his caveman outfit after he saw a helpless victim being battered outside a pub in Stourbridge, West Midlands. CCTV footage which captured the moment made headlines around the world last week after police released it in a bid to trace the attacker. Scroll down for video . Courageous caveman: Karl Stephenson came to the aid of a man who was being savagely beaten on a night out, while wearing this fancy dress costume . And now fearless Karl, who managed to scare the thug away before staying with the 31-year-old injured man until an ambulance arrived, has spoken of the ordeal. Just moments before the attack, the victim was pushed to the ground before the thug rained blows on his face and continued to kick him in the head. Armed with just his inflatable club, Karl, in his Halloween costume, stormed over in disgust as the yob kicked and punched the man unconscious. But modest Karl, of Hagley, West Midlands, today said he was just trying to be a good citizen. He said: 'For some reason my friends went out the front door and I went out the back. That's when I saw the man being kicked. 'There were three men attacking him. I wanted them to stop so I went over and asked them what they were doing. Sickening: The attacker kicks the victim in the head as he lies defenceless on the ground . Vicious: The CCTV footage shows the thug attacking the victim even though he is clearly helpless . 'One of my friends called the police and ambulance to help the injured man. 'It was really horrible. It was one of those moments where I was thinking ""was that real?"" I couldn't believe it had happened.' Karl said the man had been badly injured, but he was glad he was recovering well. Rescued: The attacker stops after Karl, dressed as a caveman, and his acquaintance arrive to pull him off his victim . He said: 'I was just trying to be a good citizen and I hope somebody would so the same for me. 'The first thing I knew about the footage being released was when my sister text me to say she had heard it on the radio. 'I couldn't believe it when I saw the video - it was everywhere. Out of all the things I could be wearing it was a dead caveman costume. 'We had decided to wear fancy dress because it was almost Halloween.' Helping hand: Karl is seen to drop his club as he comes to the aid of the beaten victim . Detective Constable John Horrobin, from West Midlands Police, appealed for any witnesses to the incident on October 27 to come forward . He said: 'In the footage you will see a couple of people in fancy dress costume. 'There had been a fancy dress party at the Mitre Inn on that night and we are appealing to anyone that may have seen the victim on the night to come forward. 'If you saw the assault we would also like to speak to you - ultimately we are hoping that someone will recognise the attacker and will come forward with a name. 'The victim has little recollection of the attack and thankfully he will make a full recovery.'

Her mother Kristi Taylor told WKRG-TV: . 'He tried to kill her. He's lucky he didn't kill her. She's lucky to be . alive. I didn't recognize her when I got here. It's hard to look at her . like that.' Miss Owens was hospitalized and treated for a broken nose and numerous lacerations. Her eyes were swollen shut after the brutal beating and she had to receive facial reconstruction surgery. Ms Taylor said that there was friction with the Hawkins family over the fact that her daughter was gay and had a relationship with the sister, which Hawkins reportedly did not approve of.

David Cameron has been warned by the French that he cannot treat Europe as an ‘a la carte’ menu, where Britain picks and chooses which bits it likes. French President Francois Hollande insisted signing up to the euro bloc was ‘for life’ and ruled out allowing the UK to take back powers already surrendered to Brussels. Mr Cameron will use a major speech in the New Year to spell out set out his vision on Britain’s place in the European Union, offering a referendum on a new settlement. What entente cordiale? French President Francois Hollande warned David Cameron he could not treat Europe like an 'a la carte' menu, scuppering hopes of Britain bringing powers back from Brussels . The PM is expected to reveal the results of a coalition review of EU powers which he wants to repatriate, including justice, business and employment regulations. But Mr Hollande signalled his opposition to the idea, arguing the 27 member states must sign up to the EU’s entire policy programme. It raises the prospect of France blocking any attempt by Britain to negotiate a new relationship with Europe, scuppering Mr Cameron’s hopes of placating a growing band of Eurosceptics on the Tory benches. Mr Hollande told reporters at the European Council summit in Brussels: ‘To repatriate? Usually when a country commits it is for life. ‘I believe that treaties are meant to be complied with. This discussion could take place but Europe is not a Europe in which you can take back competences. It is not Europe a la carte.’ The warning echoes remarks made . earlier this week by Cecilia Malmström, EU home affairs commissioner, . who said it would be difficult for Britain to opt out of a raft of laws . and then opt in to the ones it likes. She . told the Financial Times: ‘On each of these opt-ins there will have to . be a negotiation and the other member states will have to agree.’ But today Mr Cameron was defiant, insisting: ‘There has to be flexibility in Europe.’ Mr Cameron told reporters at the European Council that there was nothing to fear in the eurozone becoming more closely integrated, creating a two-speed Europe . The PM was speaking after EU leaders agreed a deal for a new banking watchdog for countries which use the single currency. Mr Cameron told reporters at a press conference he hoped to use the closer integration of the Eurozone nations to secure a ‘better deal’ for Britain. ‘The changes that the euro is driving, of course are affecting the eurozone countries, but they affect all of us. They affect the organisation that we are a member of, that we are a contributor to, that we are an important part of. ‘There has to be flexibility in Europe. There has to be flexibility that respects the fact that there are countries that don’t want to, and never will in our case, in my view, join the euro. ‘But also I believe it will lead to opportunities for us in the UK to make changes in our relationship with the European Union that will suit us better, that the British people will be more comfortable about.’ Mr Cameron wants the EU to go further on scrap regulations but praised progress made so far. His long-awaited Europe speech, due this month, is now expected early in the New Year. At a Westminster lunch this week, the Premier defended delays in ‘tantric’ approach to policymaking., adding: ‘It will be even better when it does eventually come.’","British PM wants to repatriate powers from the EU before putting new settlement to British people in a referendum .

An amber chess board taken by King Charles 1 to his execution has been sold for a record £600,000. The board was owned by the controversial King, who was such an enthusiast for chess he was engrossed in a game when a messenger told him he had been betrayed by the Scots to the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War. The news sealed the royal's fate and he was executed on January 30, 1649. Royal game: The chess board believed to have been owned by King Charles I, which has been sold for a record breaking £600,000 at an auction . Final moves: The amber board opens up to reveal a board for the game backgammon, one of the oldest board games for two players which also involves an element of luck . Strategy games: On the other side of the piece is a board for the game Nine Men's Morris, which has also been known as Cowboy Checkers . It is known the King took with him . two precious possessions to the scaffold where he was beheaded: a Bible . and an amber games board, believed to be the one that has now sold for £601,250. Erik Bijzet, an expert in European sculpture at auctioneers Sotherby's, said: 'This board was made by Georg Schreiber who was known as the ""King of the Gamesboards"". 'He was an amber worker in Koeningsberg, the capital of Prussia, . where amber washed up on the shores of the East Sea in small amounts. Chess enthusiast: Charles, pictured here with what is believed to be a chess piece around his neck, was an avid fan of the 'King's Game', known to have been used to teach war strategy . 'The board is dated 1607 and was given to either James I or Henry Frederick as Charles was only seven-years-old then. 'When . at the height of the Civil War a messenger arrived to inform Charles . that he had been betrayed by the Scots he didn't rise from his game of . chess, even though his fate had effectively been sealed. 'Charles took a Bible and a games board with him to the scaffold where he was beheaded.' Following his death the items were passed on to his personal chaplain, Bishop William Juxon, who read Charles his last rites. The board then remained in his family until the 18th century before it was acquired by British peer Sir Robert Hesketh. It has now been sold by the Second Baron Hesketh's Will Trust. The board was bought at auction in London by a private collector, following a dramatic bidding war, for £601,250, the highest amount ever paid for an amber games board. Mr Bijzet said: 'It entered into the ownership of the Hesketh family and an inventory of their possessions is the earliest record that mentions that the board belonged to Charles. Execution: King Charles was believed to have taken the amber chess board to the scaffold where he was beheaded for high treason in 1649 . 'Besides the provenance, this board is a tour-de-force of amber working, is of superb quality and was made by the maker of Royal chess sets. 'We only know of four comparable boards, none of which have seemed to survive in good condition.' The board, which measures 27ins by 13ins, opens into two halves, allowing it to be used for different games including chess, backgammon, draughts and Nine Men's Morris, a strategy board game which emerged from the Roman Empire. The board would have been extremely sought after and expensive during the 17th century due to amber being found only in small quantities. Mr Bijzet said: 'Everyone in the saleroom seemed to hold their breath when the bidding went down to the collectors. 'As these two reached the limits of their resources a third contender in the front row entered the bidding and won the object.' King Charles I, was the first monarch to be tried and executed for treason. His final years were dominated by the English Civil War, which saw him battle the English and Scottish parliaments who were challenging his bid to to do away with parliamentary authority. He also used his position as head of the English Church to pursue religious policies which angered reformed groups such as the Puritans. He was defeated in the First Civil War, which lasted from 1642 to 1645, and was expected to accept Parliament's demands for a constitutional monarchy. However, Charles attempted to forge an alliance with Scotland, prompting the start of the Second Civil War in 1648. He was defeated for a second time and subsequently tried and executed for high treason, in 1649. The monarchy was abolished and the Commonwealth of England, also known as the Cromwellian Interregnum, came into power. An 11-year gap in royal rule followed before Charles' son, Charles II, took the reins in the restoration of 1660.

Parents are being warned not to buy face painting sets for their children without checking them after thousands were found to contain lead. More than 7,000 Tartan Collection paint pot sets have been imported from a factory in China by Chelford Ltd in Salford, Greater Manchester, and sold on to outlets throughout the UK. The sets could cause brain damage in very young children - and only 324 out of the 7,200 sets have been recovered. Chelford Ltd has been ordered to pay more than £14,000 at Manchester Magistrates' Court for breaching product safety laws. Danger: The Tartan Collection sets which contain lead (left) and the UK boss who distributed them, Joel Cope . Boss Joel Cope, 39, was also hauled into court and fined £1,200 for putting the public's health at risk. A Trading Standards investigation . found the sets, which were discovered on sale at shops in Salford and . Rochdale, included lead which can be absorbed through the skin. It is not known how many painting sets have been bought or used. Salford City Council is now warning parents to stay away from the face paint sets when buying Christmas presents. Importer: Chelford Ltd in Salford, Greater Manchester, where the poisoned face painting sets were brought in . Salford mayor Ian Stewart said: 'It's very worrying, especially at this time of year, that these dangerous items have found their way on to the high street. 'It's really important that the public are extremely vigilant. These sets can be very dangerous, particularly to small children.' Mr Cope admitted six breaches of product safety regulations in his role as managing director of Chelford Ltd, based at Agecroft Trading Estate in Langley Road, Salford, as well as a further six identical offences on behalf of the company. Cope, from Lancaster Drive, Prestwich, was in charge of the firm - which specialises in keyrings and stationery - when it sold the 7,200 Tartan Collection face paint and stencil sets, containing lead, to shops around the country. Some were found on sale at Pound Paradise store in Gerald Street, Salford, and others in Budget Greeting Cards Ltd in Milnrow, Rochdale. Salford trading standards officers bought a test sample from Pound Paradise and discovered they were toxic. The court heard that Salford trading standards officers were first contacted about Chelford Ltd last year by health officials in Ireland who had discovered the firm's paints on sale there contained lead. The officials told Cope that the paints were potentially toxic, but he did not immediately recall the items in the UK, the court heard. Laura Raine, prosecuting for Salford council, said: 'He used the excuse that he thought the laws were different in Ireland.' Trading standards later issued a notice ordering Chelford to recall the paints. Toby Sasse, representing Chelford Ltd and Cope, said his clients had co-operated with the investigation and admitted guilt. Mr Sasse said Cope had been given misleading advice by consultants who suggested he was complying with the correct regulations. He said Cope was carrying out further testing of the paints when trading standards became involved.","Face painting sets from factory in China could cause brain damage .

It's the NBA. You've got to get used to it.' After the game, Celtics coach Doc Rivers . told reporters: 'Kevin could have gotten hurt. He's in the air. He took . a bad fall. And so Rondo saw that and probably reacted, and . over-reacted, obviously.' Battle wounds: After the game, Humphries posted this picture on Twitter with the caption, 'Anyone know where I can quick get a Tetanus shot in Boston?' 'I think guys just try to defend . themselves,' Nets coach Avery Johnson said. 'I think the league should . really take that into account. Because I don't know if guys can just . walk away all the time. They've got to kind of protect themselves.' Humphries kept in good humor about the situation, posting a photo of his scratched left shoulder with the caption, 'Anyone know . where I can quick get a Tetanus shot in Boston?' The photo was met with some criticism on the microblogging site, as one fan mocked him as 'cry baby Kris.' Another said: 'Don't mess with Boston brah... Cuz it bites back.' Fox Sports commentator Erin Andrews tweeted: 'Really?? tweeting a post gm ""scratched"" arm photo from a hoops gm? have you seen the injuries NFL and NHL players get? #taketheskirtoff.' Rage-on: Rondo, who was rejected from the game, was suspended twice last year for violence toward NBA officials . Rondo is no stranger to NBA discipline. He was suspended for one game in the first round of last year's playoffs against Atlanta following an incident with referee Marc Davis, whom Rondo chest-bumped . while complaining about a call in the final minute of a Celtics loss. In the 2011-12 regular season, he was suspended for two games for hurling a basketball at one of the officials. 'Usually he goes after the refs,' Rivers said. 'This was another guy, so this was better.' While . Humphries has been playing in the NBA since 2004, the Nets power . forward launched into national consciousness with his televised . courtship of reality starlet Kim Kardashian. Brief romance: Humphries was married to reality star Kim Kardashian for just 72 days in what was widely viewed as a new low for celebrity marriages. The divorce proceedings are still ongoing . The camera followed their engagement and star-studded wedding on August 20, 2011 - a ratings powerhouse for the E! network. But it all came crashing down just 72 days later when Kardashian filed for divorce. Humphries . fired back, petitioning for an annulment on the grounds that he was the . victim of an elaborate sham orchestrated by the Kardashian clan to . further their own interests and products. The spectacle was widely viewed as a new low for celebrity marriages. While Humphries has been linked to on-again, off-again girlfriend Myla Sinanaj, Kardashian continues to get hot and heavy with rapper Kanye West, but their divorce is still not yet final.

"By . Daniel Miller . PUBLISHED: . 06:45 EST, 14 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:26 EST, 14 December 2012 . Mobile phone apps which allow wives and husbands to spy on their spouses by monitoring their whereabouts as well as their calls and text messages will be banned under a new law to be put before congress. Software companies are currently able to sell so-called cyberstalking apps that operate secretly on cellphones thanks to a loophole in current laws. Apps such Retina Software's SpouseSpy or ePhoneTracker, which sell for around $50 online, have become increasingly popular among jealous wives or husbands, but there are concerns they could be encouraging stalking and domestic violence. Cyberspy: Mobile phone apps such as SpouseSpy allow users to monitor their partners' whereabouts and mobile phone communications . After being installed on a person's phone, ePhoneTracker works by automatically emailing details of their activities to the worried partner. 'Suspect your spouse is cheating?' the company's website says. 'Don't break the bank by hiring a private investigator.' Their website proudly describes how the app 'silently records EVERYTHING including full SMS messages, call info, GPS locations, web sites visited, contacts added and more'. But yesterday, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill that makes it a crime for companies to make and intentionally operate a stalking app. The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., also would curb the appeal for such inexpensive and easy-to-use programs by requiring companies to disclose their existence on a target's phone. Stalking and wiretapping already are illegal, but there are no provisions in federal law that clearly prohibit businesses from making an app whose primary purpose is to help one person stalk another. Sen. Franken's proposal would extend the criminal and civil liabilities for the improper use of the apps to include the software companies that sell them. The proposal would update laws passed years before wireless technology revolutionized communications. Telephone companies currently are barred from disclosing to businesses the locations of people who make traditional phone calls. But there's no such prohibition when communicating over the Internet. If a mobile device sends an email, links to a website or launches an app, the precise location of the phone can be passed to advertisers, marketers and others without the user's permission. 'What's most troubling is this: Our law is not protecting location information,' said Sen. Franken, chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law. An emailed statement from Retina Software said the program is for the lawful monitoring of a cellphone that the purchaser of the software owns and has a right to monitor. 'If there is evidence the customer doesn't own the phone, the account is closed, the company said. The program is not intended or marketed for malicious purposes and doesn't facilitate stalking, the statement said. The spy apps are also marketed as a way for concerned parents to monitor their children's mobile phones . But Franken and supporters of his bill said there is no way to ensure the rules are followed. These programs can be installed in moments, perhaps while the cellphone's actual owner is sleeping or in the shower. The apps operate invisibly to the cellphone's user. They can silently record text messages, call logs, physical locations and visits to websites. All the information is relayed to an email address chosen by the installer. Even when people discover the software on their phones, they don't know what to do, said Rick Mislan, a Rochester Institute of Technology professor who specializes in mobile security and forensics. 'Law enforcement usually won't help them because they've got bigger fish to fry,' he said. Franken's bill is a common-sense step . to curb stalking and domestic violence by taking away a tool that gives . one person power over another, victims advocacy groups said. Senator Al Franken chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee which has approved a bill making it a crime for companies to make stalking apps . 'It's really, really troubling that an industry would see an opportunity to make money off of strengthening someone's opportunity to control and threaten another individual,' said Karen Jarmoc, executive director of the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Franken's bill would make companies subject to civil liability if they fail to secure permission before obtaining location information from a person's cellphone and sharing it with anyone else. They also would be liable if they fail to tell a user no later than seven days after the service begins that the program is running on their phone. Companies would face a criminal penalty if they knowingly operate an app with the intent to facilitate stalking. The bill includes an exception to the permission requirement for parents who want to place tracking software on the cellphones of minor children without them being aware it is there. A domestic violence case in St. Louis County, Minn., helped persuade Franken to introduce his bill. A woman had entered a county building to meet with her advocate when she received a text message from her abuser asking her why she was there, according to congressional testimony delivered last year by the National Network to End Domestic Violence. Frightened, she and her advocate went to the local courthouse to file for a protective order. She got another text demanding to know why she was at the courthouse. They later determined her abuser was tracing her movements with an app that had been placed on her cellphone. The woman was not identified by name in the congressional testimony. Franken said that while doing research for the bill, he heard similar stories from women in Iowa, Wisconsin, Arizona and several other states. An organization representing software companies opposes Franken's bill because it said the user consent requirement would curb innovation in the private sector without adequately addressing the problem of cyberstalking. Voluntary but enforceable codes of conduct for the industry are more effective methods for increasing transparency and consumer confidence, said David LeDuc, senior director for public policy at the Software & Information Industry Association. Those concerns resonated with the Judiciary Committee's top Republican and one of its senior Democrats. The bill could have unintended consequences for an industry that is growing and creating new jobs, said Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Both senators voted for the bill, however.","Secret apps record texts, calls, photos and GPS locations before emailing details to the concerned party .

"By . Louise Boyle and Thomas Durante . PUBLISHED: . 00:49 EST, 6 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:53 EST, 7 December 2012 . A father who launched a transatlantic custody battle against his estranged wife over their daughter has accused his former partner of drunkenness and domestic violence. U.S. Army Sgt Jeffrey Lee Chafin is reportedly 'deeply concerned' about Lynn Hales' abilities as a mother. The bitter custody dispute is over the couple's five-year-old daughter Eris. When the couple split up in 2010, Ms Hales, a Scottish native, sued for custody and took the girl back to Scotland from Alabama. The Supreme Court is now considering whether an American court can have any further say in the international custody dispute. A decision is expected to be made in the next few months. Sgt Chafin this week questioned Ms Hales fitness as a parent. He said she was arrested on . Christmas Eve 2010 for threatening him with a knife as their marriage broke down, according to the Daily Telegraph. Ms Hales denies . these claims. She was also arrested earlier in December 2010 for being drunk in public and reportedly fighting with a taxi driver in the U.S. but was never charged. Sgt Chafin's lawyer Michael E. Manely told MailOnline today that he expected a swift decision on the case and believed that the Supreme Court would find in favor of his client. Mr Manely said his client, who remains on active service with the U.S. Army, wants his daughter to be returned to America. Mr Manely described the Chafins, who have a divorce case pending in Alabama, as having a 'love-hate' relationship. However he added that they seemed intent on working out custody arrangements for their daughter. Custody fight: The Supreme Court is trying to determine whether Sgt Jeffrey Lee Chafin, can appeal a federal judge's decision to let his estranged wife take their daughter Eris back to her native Scotland . Mother: A lawyer for Lynne Hales Chafin, pictured, argues that the Supreme Court no longer has jurisdiction . Sgt Chafin and Ms Hales, of Muirhead, . Lanarkshire, got married in Germany in 2006 and their daughter was born . there the following year. The . family resided in Germany before Sgt Chafin, 42, was deployed to . Afghanistan. Mother and daughter returned to her family in Scotland. In . 2009, Sgt Chafin was posted to Redstone Arsenal, Alabama and was joined . by 35-year-old Mrs Chafin and Eris where they began to build a life . together. However over the next year, the relationship broke down. Hales was deported back to Scotland in 2011 for overstaying her tourist visa. She . sued to take their five-year-old daughter Eris with her, citing the 1980 Hague convention on . international child abductions. The . convention is designed to return children . illegally taken from member countries. She said their daughter's . residence was Scotland and that her husband illegally retained the child . in the United States. A . federal judge agreed and allowed the girl be taken to Scotland. The . judge also refused to allow an appeal. Sgt . Chafin then took the case to the circuit court, which said the case could not be considered because the child's official residence is in Scotland. Now in the Supreme Court, judges are trying to . determine whether Sgt Chafin can appeal a federal judge's decision to . let Lynne Hales Chafin take Eris to Scotland. The . 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Sgt Chafin's appeal was . moot because the girl has now been in Scotland for more than a year, and . that his only remedy is in the Scottish courts. Firing back: Hales has argued that their daughter's residence was Scotland . Justice . Ruth Bader Ginsburg told Sgt Chafin's lawyer . that the point of the Hague Convention was to stop the shuttling of . children from country to country during custody disputes. She . said: 'What you're urging is exactly what this Convention was meant to . stop. 'This child has been in Scotland for 14 months. Now, you say bring . it back to the United States, and we start over. 'The whole object of the return procedure is so that you get the child to a place that's a proper place to determine custody.' But several judges seemed concerned by the idea that a foreign-born parent could escape U.S. court jurisdiction by leaving the country. Chief Justice John Roberts said the situation would encourage such parents in custody disputes 'to leave immediately' following a favorable decision, even though it is not a final decision in U.S. courts. Roberts said that was a parent flees 'it is all over', calling the situation a 'very unfortunate result'. Lynne Chafin's lawyer Stephen Cullen said if a child has left America on an international flight the jurisdiction of the U.S. court system is over. 'There can be no re-return' order from the U.S. courts, Mr Cullen said, adding that Sgt Chafin can plead his case in Scottish courts.

"By . Daniel Miller . PUBLISHED: . 04:29 EST, 7 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:08 EST, 7 December 2012 . Former Nazi guard Anton Geiser, 88, has appealed against a deportation ruling arguing he was forced to serve in the SS . A former Nazi concentration camp guard, who has lived in the U.S. for more than 50 years, has launched an appeal arguing he should not be deported because he was forced to join the SS as a teenager. The case of Anton Geiser, 88, was yesterday being heard at the Board of Immigration Appeals in Falls Church, the nation's highest immigration court, where his lawyer argued that he had served in Hitler's army against his will. At a 2010 hearing, Geiser, of Sharon, Pa, acknowledged serving in the Nazi SS as a guard in the Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald concentration camps for which a federal judge ordered he should be deported to any country that would take him, of which one possibility was Austria. But his lawyer Adrian Roe argued that the court should have considered that Geiser was forced to join the SS against his will as a 17-year-old. Government lawyers argued to uphold the deportation saying federal law places former Nazis in a harsher immigration category, and no exceptions should be made because of   compulsory service. Mr Roe acknowledged that Congress did indeed place Nazis in a separate, harsher category when it comes to determining their rights to immigrate to and live in the U.S. But he said that not everyone conscripted into the Hitler war machine is truly a Nazi. He argued: 'The label Nazi itself sort of goes to belief. If they were a true believer, we don't want them here. If they were a forced participant, are they really a Nazi?' Geiser, who was recently hospitalized, did not attend yesterday's hearing. He came to the U.S. in 1956 and was naturalized in 1962. He lived in Sharon, about 75 miles north of Pittsburgh, where he worked in a steel mill for decades and raised five children. Justice Department lawyer Susan Siegal questioned whether Geiser's service as a camp guard was truly involuntary. She said he could have requested a transfer back to the Russian front, where he was initially serving, or that he could have simply walked away from service or defied immoral orders. She said the Nuremberg trials after . World War II and military code established the precedent that following . immoral orders is not an adequate defense. 'I'm sorry - Mr. Geiser did engage in crimes against humanity,' Siegal said. Roe took exception to the portrayal of . Geiser as a war criminal. Geiser says he was forced to join the SS in . 1942, and that he never killed anyone, though tens of thousands are . believed to have died at Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen. Tragic times: Soldiers of the Third Reich arrest factory leaders . Concentration bunks: Wooden bunks stand inside a children's barracks, Compound BII13, at Birkenau, part of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest Nazi concentration camp and extermination camp in operation during World War II . Geiser does not dispute that the Nazi camps were horrific, and he previously told prosecutors he was ashamed of his service. 'I was not proud where I served and I didn't like it then and I didn't like it now,' he said. Roe argued that a 2009 Supreme Court decision requires . immigration judges to consider whether an alleged perpetrator of . persecution was doing so voluntarily. More broadly, he said U.S. law in . nearly all aspects takes into account whether a person was forced to act . against his will, and he said the same principles should be extended to . Geiser's case. The three members of the Board that . heard the case - two appointed by Republicans, one by a Democrat - are . expected to issue their ruling in a few months. While it is the highest immigration . court, it is an administrative body and its rulings are subject to . review by federal judges and the Supreme Court. It is expected that the . board's ruling will be appealed by the losing side. Tucked away: Geiser has been living in the small western Pennsylvania town Sharon for more than 50 years . The Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald . camps held some political and military prisoners, but tens of thousands . of people also died there under horrific conditions, such as starvation, . slave labor, medical experiments, and executions. Peter . Black, the senior historian at the United States Holocaust Memorial . Museum, said that it's ‘very difficult’ to tell whether any particular . individual actually volunteered for the SS, or was pressured to join. But he said the guards were essential to the concentration camp system. ‘Even . if they don't have any contact with a prisoner, by walking the . perimeter as an armed guard, they are helping to keep the people inside . that place where they are enduring persecution,’ Black said, adding that . SS guards were paid, got leave time, and health benefits for their . service. Most of the hearing, though, dealt not . with Geiser's actions during the war but on narrow questions of legal . precedent.","Anton Geiser, 88, claims he was forced to join the SS as a 17-year-old .

A woman reported to be Casey Anthony was seen eating out at a steakhouse in Lake Worth, Florida, on Friday. Gossip Extra was the first to report the possible sighting . Murdered: Caylee Anthony, pictured with Casey, was not yet three years old when she disappeared from Orlando, Florida, in 2008 . RadarOnline reports that sources have confirmed that the woman seen in the photo is indeed Anthony. In the picture, the woman is seen wearing a white knitted hat over her dark hair, as well as a . white blouse and beige cardigan. She is seen sitting next to an . unidentified bald man. Regular customer of the restaurant said they don't know . the man and had never seen him before. Gossip Extra  reports that Pat . McKenna, a private investigator who worked on Anthony's case and also . help clear OJ Simpson, was seated across from her. McKenna is not seen in the photo, but reportedly paid for the meal with a credit card under his name. Gossip Extra claims the photo, taken Friday, is possible proof that Anthony is hiding out in South Florida. Anthony has long been rumored to be in Palm Beach, near Lake Worth, but it has never been confirmed. Jose Lambiet, the founder of Gossip Extra, has offered a $1,000 bounty for 'irrefutable proof' that she is living in Palm Beach County. Night out: Anthony went to this outpost Flanigan's Seafood Bar and Grill in Lake Worth, Florida, which is part of a South Florida restaurant chain . If the woman at the table is Casey Anthony, she appears to be taking precautions before going out in public. One of the men when into the restaurant ahead of her and waited for a table about 7pm Friday. The woman, claimed to be Anthony, only came inside once the table was ready. In hiding: Anthony's whereabouts are unknown and she reportedly does not leave her home . Gossip Extra reports that tipsters at .

'No one wants to be associated with Casey, it's just such bad publicity,' a source told Radar Online. 'She was really quiet and not that many people were noticing it was her.' Caylee disappeared in July 2008, shortly before her third birthday. She was not reported missing for 31 days, until Casey's grandparents discovered Casey's car had a strong odor of decomposition.

During the time her daughter was missing, Casey partied with friends and participated in a 'hot body' contest at an Orlando nightclub. Caylee's body was found bound and gagged in a garbage bag in a swamp in December 11 - just a few miles from the Orlando home of Casey's parents. During the trial, prosecutors argued the Casey killed her daughter because she was a burden to her social life. However, Casey's parents testified in her favor and a jury acquitted her of nearly all charged in June 2011. Tragic: Caylee wasn't reported missing for 31 days.

Hazing claims: Soccer coach Michael Divincenzo is under investigation after three teenage boys were allegedly sodomized by players at a Des Plaines high school . A soccer coach witnessed a teenage boy being sodomized by teammates then congratulated the victim, asking 'if it was all good', it has been claimed. The new allegations on Wednesday concern an incident in July involving coach Michael Divincenzo, known to students as 'Divo', who reportedly told older players to assault freshmen. The fresh claim came to light after three boys were allegedly sexually assaulted in a hazing ritual at Maine West . High School in Des Plaines, Illinois on September 27. It has been alleged that three boys were shoved to the ground and beaten by the older members of the varsity team. The players then held them down, pulled down their pants, tore off their underwear and sodomized each of them. The coaches supported the hazing . ritual, by ordering a 'campus run' after the three . freshman made the senior team, the Daily Herald reported. Divincenzo, two coaches who are also teachers at . theschool and varsity coach Emilo . Rodriguez, have been transferred with pay, pending the outcome of a . school district investigation. Three other coaches have been fired. A Des Plaines police investigation of the incident led to six students being sent to juvenile court to face hazing charges.

Antonio Romanucci, the attorney who filed a lawsuit on behalf of three students and their parents, said the hazing . practice has taken place at the school for the last four years.

The U.S. jobless rate fell to a four year low of 7.7 percent the Labor Department announced today as 146,000 jobs were added to the economy in November. However, the news was not all rosy for the U.S. economy and President Obama, with one worrying aspect to the Labor Deparment's report showing a drop in the size of the workforce as a whole - an indication that some people have given up looking for work altogether. The mixed report offered a mixed picture for the economy with hiring remaining steady during Superstom Sandy and in the face of looming fiscal cliff tax rises. However Obama administration admitted that employers added 49,000 fewer jobs in October and September than they had estimated. The US unemployment rate fell in November to a nearly four-year low and job growth picked up but showed only modest improvement in the economy . The unemployment rate fell to a four-year low in November from 7.9 percent in October mostly because more people stopped looking for work and weren't counted as unemployed. There were signs that the storm disrupted economic activity. Construction employment dropped 20,000. And weather prevented 369,000 people from getting to work – the most in almost two years. They were still counted as employed. 'The labor market is not getting worse, but is . also not getting much better,' said Jacob Oubina, a senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. Stock futures jumped after the report. Dow Jones industrial average futures were down 20 points in the minutes before the report came out at 8:30 a.m., and just after were up 70 points. Chart showing trend in weekly claims for unemployment insurance since December 2007 - figures released today showed that U.S. jobless claims have dropped to their lowest level for four years . As money moved into stocks, it moved out of safer bonds. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which moves opposite the price, rose to 1.63 percent from 1.58 percent just before the report. Since July, the economy has added an average of 158,000 jobs a month. That's a modest pickup from 146,000 in the first six months of the year. The increase suggests employers are not yet delaying hiring decisions because of the 'fiscal cliff.' That's the combination of sharp tax increases and spending cuts that are set to take effect next year without a budget deal. Retailers added 53,000 positions while temporary help companies added 18,000 and education and health care also gained 18,000. Auto manufacturers added nearly 10,000 jobs. Still, overall manufacturing jobs fell 7,000. That was pushed down by a loss of 12,000 jobs in food manufacturing that likely reflects the layoff of workers at Hostess. Sandy forced restaurants, retailers and other businesses to close in late October and early November in 24 states, particularly in the Northeast. The U.S. grew at a solid 2.7 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter. But many economists say growth is slowing to a 1.5 percent rate in the October-December quarter, largely because of the storm and threat of the fiscal cliff. That's not enough growth to lower the unemployment rate. The storm held back consumer spending and income, which drive economic growth. Consumer spending declined in October and work interruptions caused by Sandy reduced wages and salaries that month by about $18 billion at an annual rate, the government said. Still, many say economic growth could accelerate next year if the fiscal cliff is avoided. The economy is also expected to get a boost from efforts to rebuild in the Northeast after the storm. November's job gains were in line with the trend that has prevailed all year. Job growth has averaged 151,000 per month since January, just enough to push the jobless rate lower, but only slowly. Economists say roughly 200,000-250,000 jobs per month are normally needed to really make headway. U.S. employment grew faster than expected in November, but a drop in the jobless rate to a near-four year low as people gave up the search for work suggested the labor market was still tepid . The 0.2 percentage point drop in the unemployment rate last month to 7.7 percent -- the lowest since December 2008 -- reflected a decrease in the size of the labor force as measured by a survey of households. Economists generally rely more heavily on the payrolls reading from the separate and much larger survey of employers. While job gains for both September and October were revised to show 49,000 fewer jobs created than earlier reported, the revision was concentrated in the government sector. Private sector job growth did slow in November to 147,000 from 189,000 in October, but economists were heartened it did not drop off more in light of the storm. 'While more work remains to be done, today's employment report provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to heal from the wounds inflicted by the worst downturn since the Great Depression,' said Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Employment continues to be held back by fears the government may fail to prevent the $600 billion in automatic tax hikes and government spending cuts set to take hold at the start of next year. The debt crisis in Europe has also weighed. Worries about this 'fiscal cliff' hit consumer sentiment in early December. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary confidence reading plummeted to 74.5 in early December from 82.7 a month earlier. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., right, accompanied by Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., gestures during a news conference in Washington, Thursday, Dec. 6, 2012, to discuss efforts to boost the economy . 'Confidence plunged in early December as consumers confronted the rising likelihood that political gridlock would push the country over the fiscal cliff,' survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement. With the labor market far from full health, Federal Reserve policymakers, who meet on Tuesday and Wednesday, look certain to keep U.S. monetary policy on its current ultra-easy course. Economists said an anticipated tightening of fiscal policy next year, even if a deal is reached to avoid completely going over the fiscal cliff, provides ample reason for the U.S. central bank to maintain its stance. 'It doesn't change the outlook for the Fed ... I still would be expecting them to announce next week that they'll be extending their (bond) purchases to next year,' said Jeremy Lawson, a senior U.S. economist at BNP Paribas in New York. Relentless labor market weakness led the Fed in September to launch a program to buy $40 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities every month to drive down borrowing costs. That is on top of a program dubbed 'Operation Twist' in which it was re-weighting securities it holds toward longer maturities. Twist expires at the end of this month and economists expect the Fed to replace it with a program that buys government bonds with newly created money. All of the jobs gains in November were in the private sector, with government employment slipping 1,000. Within the vast private services sector, retail employment gained 52,600 and professional and businesses services increased 43,000. Temporary help hiring increased 18,000. In the goods-producing sector, manufacturing employment fell 7,000. Construction payrolls surprisingly dropped 20,000, despite a surge on homebuilding, which is benefiting from the Fed's accommodative policy stance.","Jobless rate fell to 7.7 percent for November - its lowest rate in four years .

In a surprise verdict the driver behind the wheel of the horrific Bronx bus crash that killed 15 passengers last year walked out of court a free man with only a $500 fine - $33 for each life. A jury found Ophadell Williams not guilty of 53 counts of manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide and assault - leaving survivors and relatives of those killed fuming in disgust. 'He’s still responsible for the crash since he was the driver,' said a shocked Florence Wong, whose 76-year-old father, Don Lee, was killed in the crash. 'He’s still responsible for the lives.' Scroll Down for Video . Ophadel Williams bows his head in relief after his not-guilty verdict is read out in court in the Bronx on Friday . Another man who lost an in-law in the tragic predawn March 2011 accident said, 'Obviously, 15 lives were lost and no one's going to pay criminally. It's an outrage.' As the verdict was read out in the Bronx court room - Williams who had faced 15-years in prison held his head in his hands as it became clear he was going to walk away a free man. The 41-year-old Brooklyn resident was convicted of one minor charge of aggravated unlicensed operation of a vehicle for which he has already served time - and his wife wept as she realised her husband would not go to prison. Turning to his lawyer Patrick Bruno, Williams' eyes welled up with tears and he whispered 'Thank you'. Ophadel Williams was released from court a free man on Friday after a Bronx jury found him not guilty of 53 counts of manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide and assault . After the verdict was announced, Williams was taken into a holding room without his handcuffs and allowed to return home. 'It was a very difficult decision to make,' said one unidentified juror to the New York Post. In March 2011, Williams claimed that he lost control of the bus he was driving from New York to Mohegan Sun Casino in Connecticut after he was cut off on the I-95 bu a tractor-trailer. Prosecutors said Williams, whose driving record included 18 suspensions over two decades, was tired when his speeding bus hit a guardrail, flipped onto its side and skidded into a highway sign pole, shearing off the roof. Of 32 passengers, 15 died and 15 were injured, some severely. Defense attorney Patrick Bruno cheered the verdict. He said the jury realized that Williams was 'a fall guy for a horrendous accident.' When the bus careered off the road at approximately 5.40 a.m. on March 12th survivors recalled screaming with fear as a signpost tore through the vehicle. However, for some, the verdict was a travesty of justice. 'I do not agree with the verdict,' said Florence Wong, the daughter of a passenger killed in the accident to the New York Daily News. 'Williams is still responsible for the lives lost. I don't believe the truck cut him off. There was no physical evidence that the truck made contact. He was responsible. He was driving the bus.' The horrific crash on the morning of March 12th 2011 led to the loss of 15 lives as gamblers made their way back from a casino resort in Connecticut . In the aftermath of the accident, the National Transportation Safety Board determined that Williams was motoring along the freeway at 78 mph in a 50 mph zone. The bus 'black box' revealed that Williams never attempted to hit the brakes to avoid the vehicle and never made contact with the tractor. Passengers who survived testified that Williams was weaving between lanes and changing speeds, which Williams' attorney said was due to his client driving through construction zones and speed traps. One witness told the court that she thought the vehicle was a 'party bus' due to the speed it was being driven at. 'We believe that our case was compelling; nevertheless we accept the decision of the jury,' said DA Robert Johnson in a statement. Emergency personnel investigate the scene of a bus crash on Interstate 95 in the Bronx borough of New York . The bus carrying gamblers coming from a Connecticut casino was sheared open like a sardine can when it struck a pole . Patrick Bruno, Williams' attorney said that the former bus driver felt terrible about the accident. In June, the National Transportation Safety Board investigated the incident and decided that driver fatigue had been the most likely cause. There reasons being that Williams had had almost no sleep over the past three days prior to the crash/ . Indicted in September 2011 for criminal charges relating to the accident, Williams was held in prison on $250,000 throughout the trial. Lawsuits seeking millions of dollars have already been filed against Williams by victims and their families, said Bruno, saying the case belongs in civil court, not criminal court. Assistant Bronx District Attorney Gary Weil said he was disappointed by the verdict. 'Everyone said it was a tough case because everyone falls asleep at the wheel at some point,' he told colleagues as he left the court.","On March 12th 2011 Ophadell Williams lost control of the bus he was driving back to New York's Chinatown and seared his vehicle through a signpost - the accident cost 15 lives .

Paedophile: Michael Gwyther was jailed for life at Swindon Crown Court for abusing three underage girls and repeatedly raping one of them . A paedophile who took a 12-year-old girl he was abusing to a notorious dogging site to be raped by another man has been jailed for life. Michael Gwyther, 44, repeatedly raped the youngster and took her to an open-air sex site where he offered to share her with other men. Swindon Crown Court heard Gwyther's campaign of abuse only came to light when parents of two other girls aged 14 and 15 who he was grooming found out and contacted police. Officers found indecent pictures and an explicit video of the 12-year-old on his phone when they arrested him at his home in Easterton, Wiltshire. Claire Marlow, prosecuting, told the court police uncovered the shocking abuse of the girl when they examined his mobile. She said one of the older girls’ mothers was looking at her daughter’s computer and found inappropriate messages from Gwyther. She said the 14-year-old said he had given her a lift home from a youth club in August last year and put his hand on her leg. Another girl, aged 15, who had also got a lift with Gwyther said she too had been molested by him around the same time. When officers tracked down the girl in the images she was too terrified to detail the horrific abuse she had suffered at the hands of Gwyther. She eventually told how he had been raping and abusing her since she was 12, and he even took her to notorious dogging site The Barn, where strangers gathered to have sex. Gwyther forced the young girl to have sex with a man while videotaping them, but that footage has not been found. Marcus Davey, defending, said his client was full of remorse for what he had done. Judge Douglas Field ruled last Friday that Gwyther presented a serious risk of reoffending. He . said: 'You have corrupted her by engaging in ever more serious sexual . activity with her, starting when she was about 12 and ending when 14 or . 15. 'When she was 12 you even started raping her. You raped her on six occasions, twice when she was under 13. Swindon Crown Court: Judge Douglas Field said Gwyther abused the girls to gratify an 'entrenched deviance' 'You took her to what was known as dogging sites where strangers gather quite openly to have sex with each other. There you have instigated her having sex with unknown men. 'You did all this to gratify your entrenched deviance; you have an excessive sexual interest in underage girls. 'You started grooming the other victims. You made contact over the internet. 'This was to groom them so they would meet you so you could commit sexual offences against them. 'Your offending has caused your victims very considerable psychological damage. 'It's quite understandable to hear they have difficulties dealing with everyday life and that will last for some time.'

The moon took quite a beating in its early days, more than previously believed, scientists reported Wednesday. This surprising new view of the moon comes from detailed gravity mapping by twin NASA spacecraft, which slipped into orbit around the celestial body earlier this year to peer into the interior. Researchers have long known that the moon and rocky planets - including the Earth - suffered heavy bombardment from asteroids and comets during their formative years billions of years ago. Scroll down for video . The variations in the lunar gravity field as measured by NASA's Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) during its primary mapping mission from March to May 2012 . These maps of the moon show the 'Bouguer' gravity anomalies on the lunar surface caused by collisions . The map was created by the dual GRAIL spacecraft transmitting radio signals to define precisely the distance between them as they orbit the Moon in formation. As they fly over areas of greater and lesser gravity caused by visible features, such as mountains and craters, and masses hidden beneath the lunar surface, the distance between the two spacecraft will change slightly. Now they are just starting to realize the extent. The moon is 'far more broken up and shattered than we've seen before,' said mission chief scientist Maria Zuber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Measurements by the NASA spacecraft called Ebb and Flow also found that the moon's crust, or outermost layer, is much thinner than scientists thought - only about 25 miles thick. Results were presented Wednesday at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco and published online in the journal Science. Though past missions have measured lunar gravity - about one-sixth Earth's pull - Ebb and Flow are the first spacecraft dedicated to this pursuit. To collect data, the washing machine-size spacecraft flew in formation, orbiting about 35 miles above the moon's surface. Their positions allowed them to look deep inside. Underground lunar dykes identified by GRAIL are 50 times longer and 1,000 times wider than the dyke on Earth seen here on the left . The resulting gravity maps revealed an exceptionally smooth lunar interior - consistent with it being pulverized by impacts. Fracturing extended deep into the crust and may have penetrated the mantle, scientists said. The maps also exposed numerous lunar features in greater detail than before including volcanoes, basins and craters. A provocative paper published last year hypothesized that Earth once had two moons that collided early on in the solar system's history to create the orb that graces the sky today. But Zuber said high-resolution mapping by the spacecraft did not find evidence for that. The mission is scheduled to end later this month when Ebb and Flow crash into the moon.

The parents of twin girls have revealed they can't even cradle them, because they suffer from a rare condition which means they are as fragile as china dolls. Five-month-old twins Amy and Ava Cowan, from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, were born with Osteogenesis Imperfecta - otherwise known as brittle bones. OI sufferers can repeatedly break their bones, and may experience several hundred fractures throughout their lifetime. The condition affects just 1 in 15,000 people in the UK. Our precious baby girls: Charmaine and John with twins Ava and Amy who suffer from brittle bones . Baby Amy (left) and Ava. Their parents realised there was something wrong after they let out high-pitched cries after they were taken home . The twins' mother, Charmaine, said: 'The girls are so delicate that however gentle we are with them they're bound to break something. 'In one of the first x-rays we had after they were born the results showed they had twelve broken bones between them. I just couldn't believe it - they'd barely moved! 'It's heartbreaking because I hate to see my girls in pain, but the slightest knock can mean a break.' Charmaine, 29, and husband John, 30, have to be extra careful with their tiny daughters, because even rocking them in their arms could break their ribs. Mrs Cowan said at first the condition left her paranoid about hurting them, and with good reason. 'When they were first born, whenever . I'd hold the girls I'd place them on support cushions, and to feed them . I'd rest them on pillows. 'I would only dress them in romper . suits with velcro fastenings so I could slip their clothes on and off . quickly. I was so scared that I'd hurt them, everything was a struggle. 'One day I was bathing Ava gently under her arm when I felt it go limp. I froze and shouted out to my husband - I'd just broken her arm. 'We rushed to Ava to hospital, but we were only back from the hospital for five minutes when Amy had broken her leg by wriggling in her cot. 'It was only a couple of days later when Ava broke her ribs by fighting against her blankets in her cot.It was my first experience of the girls breaking their bones at home, and I just had no idea how I was going to be able to handle it.' Charmaine said she slowly gained confidence in handling her daughters (Ava left in left picture). Amy is pictured wearing supportive bands (right) Mr and Mrs Cowan are teaching their other children (l-r) Sophia, 4, Airan, 4, and Kaelan, 2, to be very gentle with Ava (l) and Amy . Charmaine was just 23 weeks pregnant when she was told her children would be born with health problems. 'We were told that the girls could be born with skeletal dysplasia, and it was very likely that they could be deformed. 'There are 500 types of skeletal dysplasia, so we couldn't be 100 per cent sure what they would look like, or what would be wrong with them, but we were advised to terminate the pregnancy. 'It was absolutely devastating. It was explained that the girls would be injected in the heart to terminate the pregnancy, and then I would have to deliver them. 'The thought of having to plan a funeral for them was horrendous. We were in two minds about what to do until I had a 4D scan. 'As soon as I saw their perfect little faces I knew there was no way I could have an abortion. They were my little girls, and I'd love them no matter what.' At 35 weeks' pregnant Charmaine was taken to the hospital when the levels of fluid around Amy was too low. Charmaine was given an emergency caesarean section and delivered Amy and Ava on the 25th of June 2012. Older twin Amy spent a short time in special care, but it wasn't long before Charmaine and John were able to take their two seemingly healthy baby girls home. Ava (left) and Amy shortly after birth: A scan taken when they were 11 days old revealed they both had multiple breaks . 'As soon as we got them home we knew something wasn't right. They constantly let out a high pitched scream and whatever we did we just couldn't stop them from crying. 'At 11 days old, the girls were referred to Yorkhill Children's Hospital in Glasgow for further tests to try and get to the root of the problem. 'At Yorkhill the girls were given a full body scan, and it was then the doctors noticed how many breaks they had. 'The consultant took us into a room and told us straight away that from the results of the x-ray it looked like the girls had OI. I was terrified. I had no idea what that meant, or how it would affect them. I just didn't understand.' Charmaine, and husband John then met with an occupational therapist who explained how they should look after Amy and Ava. 'They . taught us how to hold the girls without hurting them. You have to hold . them with your hands spread out around their back, because cradling them . in your arms could break their ribs. 'At home we had to make sure they had really soft beds. 'It was really daunting at first - I was terrified when we finally took the girls home three days later.' The twin girls suffer from a condition that affects just one in 15,000 people in the UK . Amy and Ava were put on bone strengthening drug pamidronate and were discharged from hospital.It's been a steep learning curve for the family, but since the twins' diagnosis, Charmaine, John, and there three older children have been learning to deal with the condition. 'My other children, Sophia 4, Kaelan 2, and Airan 1, don't really understand why they have to be so careful with their younger sisters, but they're learning to be very, very gentle. 'We have to make sure they all play quietly together, because if Amy and Ava get startled, and wake up with a fright, even that could break their bones. 'As they've got older I'm much more confident with them. You just have to be so careful. 'I do worry about what the future holds but I will never regret my decision to have my beautiful baby girls.  know they're fighters and they already have a high pain threshold.'","Amy and Ava are so fragile that even cradling them could break their ribs .

Brooks, 44, appeared first, along with former Sun chief reporter John Kay, 69, and Ministry of Defence employee Bettina Jordan-Barber, 39. Brooks, from Churchill, Oxfordshire, and Kay, from north west London, are accused of conspiring to pay Jordan-Barber around £100,000 for information. Scroll down for video . Ex-News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks arrives at Westminster Magistrates Court . Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks each faced a charge of conspiracy when they appeared in court . Prosecutors allege Brooks and Kay plotted to pay Jordan-Barber in bribes to hand over sensitive Ministry of Defence information which fuelled a series of exclusives in The Sun between January 2004 and January this year. 'All three defendants are jointly charged on one allegation of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office', said prosecutor Mark Bryant-Heron. 'On the back of confidential information, Mr Kay wrote more than 60 articles published in The Sun. 'In exchange for information, it is alleged Ms Jordan-Barber was paid £100,000 in cash over the course of more than 30 separate transactions between 2004 and 2011.' They spoke only to confirm their names, dates of birth and addresses during the short hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court. Bettina Jordan-Barber . Clive Goodman . John Kay . Wearing a black jacket and tan trousers, Brooks sat next to Kay, who was in a grey suit with a white shirt and blue tie. Both were charged with one count of conspiracy. Jordan-Barber, who is from Shrivenham near Swindon, sat apart from the pair in the dock wearing a black dress and pink shirt. She was charged with a wilful misconduct in judicial/public office. Jordan-Barber made a bid for her home address to be kept private on the grounds she would suffer media intrusion, but the application was dismissed. The three were accused of plotting together between January 1 2004 and January 31 this year. They were all released on unconditional bail until they next appear at Southwark Crown Court on December 6. Court illustration shows (from left to right) Bettina Jordan-Barber, John Kay and Rebekah Brooks sitting in the dock at Westminster Magistrates Court . Coulson and ex-News of the World (NOTW) royal correspondent Clive Goodman appeared afterwards. They are charged with conspiracy to pay for information including a royal phone directory known as the 'Green Book'. It contained contact details for the Royal Family and members of their households. Coulson, 44, from Kent, and Goodman, 55, from Surrey, face two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office - one between August 31 2002 and January 31 2003, and the other between January 31 and June 3 2005. They relate to the alleged request and authorisation of payments to public officials in exchange for information, including the royal contacts book. 'The allegation is that Mr Coulson and Mr Goodman conspired with persons unknown to acquire the Royal telephone directory', said Mr Bryant-Heron. Coulson, who wore a grey suit, white shirt and blue tie, and Goodman, who was in a dark suit with a blue shirt and purple tie, were both released on unconditional bail until the same date as the other three defendants. The charges are the first brought by the Met Police since they launched Operation Elveden, investigating alleged corruption of public officials by journalists. Brooks resigned from her post as chief executive in July 2011 in the wake of the phone hacking scandal which forced the closure of the News of the World. Coulson quit as editor of the paper in 2007, and was forced to resign as Prime Minister David Cameron’s communications guru in 2010 after allegations of phone hacking under his watch were made. Kay joined in The Sun in 1974 and went on to serve as chief reporter for 21 years until 2011. He was named Reporter of the Year twice by the British Press Association.

Anger: Starbucks will pay £20million in corporation tax over the next two years after it . was accused of acting 'immorally' for not paying the levy over the last three years . Starbucks last night caved in to public pressure and agreed to pay millions in corporation tax amid fears of a growing consumer boycott. The global coffee group struck a deal with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to pay £20million over the next two years, whether or not it reports a profit. The move will bring valuable money into Treasury coffers and piles pressure on other multi-nationals such as Google and Amazon to restructure their affairs to make contributions. But critics said the figure was an ‘arbitrary’ contribution to try to quell public anger over Starbucks’ financial affairs and warned it could go back to its ‘immoral’ tax-avoiding ways within 12 months. The deal, they said, was evidence of Britain running a ‘voluntary’ tax system where companies opt to pay what they like, rather than what they owe. Starbucks has also agreed to suspend the clever accounting techniques it used to push profits overseas and minimise its tax bill. It has not paid corporation tax for 14 of the past 15 years of trading in the UK, despite owning more than 700 stores and taking more than £3billion in sales since arriving in Britain. Last year the coffee giant registered sales of £398million but claimed to make a loss of £33million – giving it a corporation tax bill of zero. But now it will hand over £10million for the year, under the terms of yesterday’s deal. It will also pay ‘in the region of £10million’ next year, despite not knowing what its sales or profits will be. Tax accountant Richard Murphy said: ‘The accusation is that we’re now asking for tax on a voluntary basis. This isn’t a church collection – if you owe it, then you should pay it.’ He added: ‘My fear is that Starbucks haven’t changed anything. These payments are token gestures.’ By registering huge costs in the UK, Starbucks was able to report losses year after year to the taxman, meaning it faced no corporation tax. Freebies: A Starbucks worker hands out hot chocolate to cold shoppers in . London's Oxford Street, but the public are upset about the lack of . tax they have paid . It did this by charging its UK arm royalty fees for using the Starbucks logo and coffee to a sister company in the Netherlands. Six per cent of the revenue from every . cup of coffee sold in Britain was given to the Netherlands for the . rights to use the name. This will be suspended for 12 months after . yesterday’s deal. Starbucks’ arrangements, which . critics said were designed specifically to avoid paying corporation tax, . also saw it buying its coffee through Switzerland, even though the . beans never arrived on Swiss soil. It also took out loans from other . parts of the company, located in lower-tax areas, for which it was . charged large interest rates. Yesterday UK boss Kris Engskov said the group would put those practices on ice ‘for two years or until we make a profit’. 'Name and shame': MP Margaret Hodge called on ministers to reveal firms that were not paying their fair share and suggested that the Government should back boycotts like the one facing Starbucks . Crackdown plans: Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander is backing a boycott on Starbucks and other companies accused of avoiding tax . He said ‘doing the right thing is part . of the DNA of our company’, but added ‘we have always organised our tax . affairs according to the letter of the law’. The company last night could not . offer any firm assurances that it would not reinstate its old methods . for pushing profits to Switzerland and the Netherlands once the period . had ended. It said the changes were not permanent. ‘Offering to pay some tax if and when . it suits you doesn’t stop you being a tax dodger,’ said Hannah Pearce, a . spokesman for protest group UK Uncut, which is organising . demonstrations in 40 Starbucks outlets this weekend. ‘This announcement . is just a desperate attempt to deflect public pressure . . . it’s a . hollow promise.’ A spokesman for HMRC said: . ‘Corporation tax is not a voluntary tax and Parliament sets out the . rules and rates for businesses to follow. The public expects businesses . to pay their fair share and HMRC will challenge, through the courts if . necessary, any structures or tax payments that do not comply with the UK . tax law.’ The move will pile pressure on Google and Amazon to bow to public pressure and contribute to government coffers. All three were brought before the Public Accounts Committee last month to explain why they paid little or no corporation tax. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna . said: ‘Starbucks have much to do to rebuild trust among their customers . and the public. This is a welcome first step. No doubt other firms will . want to consider following their lead.’","The US-owned coffee chain has paid just £8.6 million in corporation tax in the past 14 years .

The oldest known representations of a Pharaoh dating back as far as 3200BC have been found carved on rocks near the Nile River in southern Egypt, a new study claims. Researchers say the engravings on rock faces in the desert four miles north of the Aswan Dam are the earliest found indication of royal power in the country. The images of a Pharaoh riding boats with attendant prisoners and animals offer a window on Dynasty 0, they say, and show the moment pre-Dynastic Egypt was first captured by the rule of a single monarch. The royal boat procession: This image, heavily damaged in recent times, shows the earliest known image of a ruler wearing the 'White Crown', one of the earliest symbols of Egyptian dynastic power . Traced: The researchers copy of the carving shows the detail of the picture more clearly . 'It's really the end of pre-history and the beginning of history,' study researcher Maria Gatto, of Yale University, told LiveScience. Researchers found seven carvings around the area, many of which are tableaux of boats flanked by prisoners. On of the most extensive shows the earliest known image of a ruler wearing the 'White Crown', one of the earliest symbols of Egyptian dynastic power, as he travels in ceremonial processions and on sickle-shaped boats. Falcon and bull insignia on the Pharaoh's boat indicate royalty, which is emphasised by by the four men standing alongside it holding ropes - most likely to tow it along the Nile. The cycle of images is said to be the first with hieroglyphic annotation, with one on this particular scene labelling it a 'nautical following'. This the researchers say, is likely related to the royal and ritual event known as the 'Following of Horus', a biennial tax-collection tour made by the royal court to stamp its authority on the country. Symbolism: These are animal representations, with mythological animals on the right . The same picture as it appears after being traced by the researchers . A general view of both tableaux: The site was discovered in the southern Egyptian desert, 4km north of the Aswan High Dam . Other carvings include pastoral scenes . of cattle herding and a cluster of animals, two of which appear to be . mythical part-lion creatures. 'The theme of catching and bringing up wild animals is most important for pre-Dynastic times,' the researchers said. 'Although . archaeozoological studies show that hunting was only of marginal . economic importance during pre-Dynastic times hunting was part of the . elite lifestyle, and slaughtering wild animals on the occasion of . religious festivals or elite burials allowed the upper echelons of . society to show their importance in real life.' Other animals shown are familiar native African species, including ostriches, an ibex and a bull - the latter of which is shown 'dominating' the animals around it and is said to be a royal symbol. Another tableau shows people brewing and drinking beer, perhaps in reference to some kind of festival. This carving shows a boat with three men, probably prisoners, behind and slightly below the stern: Researchers found seven carvings around the area, many of which are tableaux of boats flanked by prisoners . First recorded in the 1890s by the archaeologist Archibald Sayce, the carvings were lost to Egyptologists until the Sixties, when Egyptian archaeologist Labib Habachi found and photographed them, but never published his work. It was after seeing one of these pictures that Ms Gatto led a team of international researchers that rediscovered them in 2008, despite fears they had been destroyed in the interim . The study published in the most recent issue of Antiquity is the first to offer a detailed description of the carvings. Ms Gatto told LiveScience that the style of the carvings and the kinds of hieroglyphics dated the images to between 3200BC and 3100BC, around the time of the reign of Narmer who was the first Pharaoh to unify Upper and Lower Egypt. 'It seems that for Narmer it was important first to settle the situation in the South, to control the South, and then apparently move to the North, and at that time he unified Egypt and we have the first dynasty,' she said.","Carvings on rock faces are the earliest indication of royal power in Egypt .

"By . Jill Reilly and Alex Ward . PUBLISHED: . 15:13 EST, 8 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:55 EST, 10 December 2012 . Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian Prime Minister, has confirmed that he will stand in next year’s election, a year after being forced to resign amid a sex scandal and a debt crisis. The flamboyant 76-year-old media tycoon, who faces possible jail time for tax fraud and a trial for having sex with an underage prostitute, declared he would not allow Italy to spiral into recession and said he had been 'besieged by requests' to run. Berlusconi had hinted for months that he might make a comeback in the election which is due in about three months’ time. Is running for office: Italy's disgraced former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has confirmed that he will run for leadership again in next year's election . Berlusconi's centre-right People of Liberty Party (PDL) lags Pier Luigi Bersani's centre-left Democratic Party (PD) by at least 16 percentage points in opinion polls, and also trails the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. While another Berlusconi victory looks almost impossible, the man who has dominated Italy's centre-right for 19 years may hope to help it win enough support to keep the centre-left from winning a clear majority in both houses of parliament. The question mark that remains over the election is whether the current prime minister will run. So far current Prime Minister Mario Monti has said he will step in only if the election result is unclear, but there has been speculation he could join forces with a centrist group. But his criticism of Monti's handling of the economy was particularly harsh and came at a critical moment in the run-up to the parliamentary polls. 'The situation today is much worse than . it was a year ago when I left the government out of a sense of . responsibility and a love for my country,' Berlusconi said in a . statement issued after a long meeting with his People of Liberty (PDL) party leaders earlier in the day. Loyal: Supporters of fromer Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi hold a banner reading 'Silvio, Italy believes in you' in front of Berlusconi's Roman residence on Thursday . 'I cannot let my country fall into a recessive spiral without end. It's not possible to go on like this,' Berlusconi said after explaining that he had been 'besieged by requests from (his) party to announce at the soonest my re-entry into politics to guide the PDL.' Berlusconi's comeback arrives slightly more than a year after he resigned as prime minister as collapsing market confidence pushed Italy's debt costs to critical levels. His international reputation had already been left in tatters by lurid stories of ‘bunga bunga’ parties with pole-dancing prostitutes at his home outside Milan. He is currently appealing a four-year jail sentence for tax fraud and faces a trial over paying for sex with an underage nightclub dancer. Italians will probably vote in March with a recession that began mid-way through last year showing no signs of abating and unemployment at 11.1 percent, a record high. ‘I race to win,’ Berlusconi told reporters at the practice field for AC Milan, the soccer club he controls, after repeating criticism of Monti's handling of the economy over the past year. Trials and accusations: Mr Berlusconi, now 76, is accused in another trial of paying to have sex with Karima El-Mahroug in 2010 when she was 17 . He said: ‘To win, everyone said there had to be a tested leader. It's not that we did not look for one. We did, and how! But there isn't one... I'm doing it out of a sense of responsibility.’ His move may unsettle financial markets, whose loss of faith in Berlusconi's guidance of the economy pushed the country to the edge of a Greek-style debt crisis last year and prompted President Giorgio Napolitano to ask the former European commissioner Monti to step in to restore confidence. With the support of a right-left coalition including the PDL, Monti imposed austerity measures to bring borrowing costs under control, but Berlusconi said on Wednesday that the economic professor's policies had left Italy facing a ‘recessive spiral without end’. The PDL withdrew parliamentary . support for Monti on Thursday, raising the spectre of a snap election . and driving up the difference between German and Italian benchmark bonds . by about 30 basis points. President . Giorgio Napolitano asked the former European commissioner Monti to form . a government of technocrats with the support of a right-left coalition . that includes the PDL. Monti . imposed austerity measures to bring borrowing costs under control. But . the higher taxes have weighed on consumer spending and deepened a . recession that began in the second half of last year. Criticised: Berlusconi has argued that current Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti's handling of the economy has been particularly harsh . Though the euro zone's third-biggest economy is still struggling, Monti has calmed the financial markets and the spread between Italy and German benchmark bonds this week fell to nearly half the level it was when he took over. Monti, who is a life-appointed Senator, says he will not stand in next year's vote, but is willing to step in afterward if the result is not clear. The tone of Berlusconi's statement echoed comments made and broadcast on his Mediaset television network when he entered politics in 1994, saying he would 'take the field' to save the country from communism. In recent months, Berlusconi's hesitation to say whether or not he would run in parliamentary elections has left the centre-right in disarray just as its centre-left rivals picked their candidate, Democratic Party (PD) leader Pier Luigi Bersani, in a primary vote on Sunday. Bersani met Monti for the first time as a candidate earlier on Wednesday, and the prime minister praised the primary vote, ANSA news agency reported citing government sources.

The boss of British Airways’ parent company Willie Walsh has bet Sir Richard Branson ‘a knee in the groin’ that Virgin Atlantic will not survive five years. And Sir Richard has accepted the remarkable challenge – saying the painful debt will be paid out to the loser at the winner’s headquarters. The unusual ‘below the belt’ wager came after America's largest airline, Delta, took a 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic under a major deal announced today. Sir Richard tried to bet Walsh £1million that his Virgin airline would flourish after the deal. But Walsh said he did not have the cash and offered the 'painful' bet instead. Depending on who wins, it raises the bizarre prospect on  December 11, 2017 of airline staff witnessing Mr Walsh administering his low kick - or Sir Richard returning the favour. Sir Richard Branson (right) announces via video link at a news conference that Delta Air Lines is buying a 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic Airways . Delta Airlines CEO Richard Anderson addresses a news conference today as he announces a $360million investment in Virgin as it tries to catch up to rivals in the lucrative New York-to-London travel market . The air-rage row erupted as Virgin boss Sir Richard announced he was retaining control of his airline Virgin Atlantic after a deal that will see America's largest carrier Delta Air Lines take a 49per cent  stake. Sir Richard will retain the majority 51 per cent share. Delta has paid £224million ($360million) to buy its new  holding in Virgin Atlantic from Singapore Airlines, which paid £600million for the stake in 1999. Sir Richard said the Delta deal  secures the airline’s future and marks ‘the start of a new era of expansion.’ Sir Richard was today on his luxury private Island of Necker in  the British Virgin Islands while his team announced the Delta deal simultaneously in London and New York. Mr Walsh meanwhile was in the South Korean capital Seoul to launch a new British Airways route. But the spat – carried on over a distance of 7,000 miles and  a difference of 14 hours across international time zones  - marks the latest round of a long-running, long-distance slanging match between the two airline bosses. More... Richard Branson bets £1m with BA over Virgin's future . British Airways to cut 400 cabin crew jobs but promises all will be voluntary redundancies . Ryanair plane carrying 141 passengers from Manchester 'nearly crashed over Germany after pilots altered landing approach to make up lost time' It is also part of a deep-seated feud between the two airlines which harks back decades to an infamous ‘dirty tricks’ row. The latest twist began when Mr Walsh suggested Virgin would not survive the tie up with Delta. Sir Richard responded by offering IAG boss Mr Walsh a £1million wager that Virgin Atlantic – launched 28 years ago - would indeed survive. Speaking in Korea, Mr Walsh, chief executive of British Airways’ parent company, the International Airline Group (IAG), said he could not afford £1million but was prepared to bet his rival ‘a knee in the groin’ that Virgin Atlantic would not survive five years. He predicted that Sir Richard  would have to relinquish control by selling some of his 51pc shareholding, leaving Delta free to erase the Virgin Atlantic name. Mr Walsh told a press conference in Seoul, South Korea: ‘He’s a billionaire banker and I don’t think £1m would hurt him. ‘I don’t have £1million so maybe a bet that would be as painful for him as it might be to me. Maybe something like a knee in the groin.’ Arch rival Willie Walsh, CEO of British Airways parent company, bet Branson that Virgin Atlantic would not survive five years . The Delta and Virgin Atlantic model planes are on display at the conference. The airlines will begin a joint venture on 31 roundtrip daily flights between North America and Heathrow Airport . Mr Walsh said: ‘If he wants to bet that in five years’ time he will still own 51pc of Virgin Atlantic and it will exist in its current form …. that would be an interesting bet to accept.’ Mr Walsh also compared Branson unfavourably to outspoken Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary, who he labelled a ‘true pioneer’, despite Ryanair’s ‘awful’ service: ’I don’t see that the guy has anything that stands out in terms of what he’s achieved in the industry. I think O’Leary deserves great credit for what he’s done.’ Sir Richard responded in kind by writing on the social networking site Twitter: 'Happy to accept Willie Walsh's bet: loser to receive a knee in the groin - at winning airline's HQ. ‘We've got used to BA hitting below the belt over the years, but it would be the other way around on this occasion.' And speaking on a video link from Necker Island, Sir Richard then hit back announcing: ‘Ignore the BA and press speculation. I’m not going anywhere.’ The boss of his new partner airline Delta, speaking at the press launch in New York, then also dived into the row. Asked directly if he agreed with Mr Walsh that Delta would extinguish the Virgin name, Delta chief executive Richard Anderson said: ‘No. That actually makes my blood boil. Virgin is an iconic brand. ‘ . To laughter he added without elaborating: ’‘I don’t know what the  English term is, but we have a term in Texas….’. The deep-seated animosity between Virgin and British Airways goes back to the so-called ‘dirty tricks’ campaign in which BA managers adopted underhand tactics to undermine Virgin ticket sales leading to the two airlines suing each other. When the case came to court, in 1993, BA had to pay damages of £500,000 to Sir Richard and a further £110,000 to Virgin.","Billionaire Sir Richard Branson sells 49 per cent stake in airline to Delta .

Devastated Alex Smith, 37, suffered heart failure after developing a serious chest infection in December 2010. The former RAF dog handler, who served in the second Gulf War, was fitted with a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) which pumps blood around his body while he waits for a heart transplant.

'15 seconds from death': Alex with his LVAD machine. If it fails, he will soon die . The machine connects a pump to his heart which is attached to a battery he carries around with him 24 hours a day. If the machine fails or becomes disconnected from the battery Alex has just 15 seconds before his heart stops beating. Despite becoming exhausted after walking a few yards he had his Employment Support Allowance (ESA) of £420-a-month axed after Department of Work and Pensions officials ruled he could get a job. Bizarrely, Alex, who left the RAF in 2008 to work for the probation service helping reformed criminals, still qualifies for the highest rate of disability allowance of £520-a-month. Tired: Even walking his dog Tank is an exhausting ordeal for Alex . Divorced Alex, who has two sons, Luke, 12, and eight-year-old Dalton who live with his ex-wife, said: 'I feel like my integrity and honesty is being questioned. 'I did not want to claim benefits anyway but I did so out of necessity. 'If my machine was to fail I would pass out within 15 seconds and I would die quite quickly. 'I am 15 seconds away from death at any time. 'My life ended when my heart failed - this machine allows me to exist but not to live. He added: 'The fight will just start again if I get a transplant - you are on drugs for the rest of your life. 'I wish for a transplant but that is just the next fight starting. 'Going out to work physically drains me. After a day's work, I need to rest up completely for three days. I'm a physical wreck.' Alex, who lives in a rented house in Lincoln with fiance Elaine, 29, a teacher at a school for pupils with behavioural problems, had his benefits stopped following a physical assessment in Lincoln on October 24. He said: 'I had a call from the DWP on October 23 asking me to come for an assessment the next day which I had no problem with, I've never had anything to hide. 'But when I got to the assessment centre the officials said that because I had walked unaided into the centre that I was fit to work. 'I explained about my heart failure and even showed them the LVAD machine. The woman asked me what it did and I simply said ""If it stops I'm dead"". 'I get very tired very easily and it hurts me to accept that I am unable to work because of my condition. Lifesaver: The LVAD machine pumps blood around Alex's body as his heart failed in 2010 .

Tens of thousands of opponents and supporters of Egypt’s president have staged rival rallies in Cairo four days ahead of a nationwide referendum on a contentious draft constitution. The demonstrations came hours after masked assailants set upon opposition protesters who were taking parting in a sit-in at Tahrir Square. Security officials said birdshot was fired and knives and sticks were swung into the crowd injuring 11 protesters, according to the MENA state news agency. Armed response: An Egyptian Army tank deploys as protesters gather outside the presidential palace during a demonstration against President Mohammed Morsi . Security: Egyptian Army tanks, left, deploy outside the presidential palace . Officials later said that five ‘hardened criminals’ were arrested in connection with the attack. The violence has served as a stark reminder of the stakes in the political battle over the disputed draft constitution. A . nationwide referendum will be held on Saturday and is expected to go . ahead despite the head of Egypt’s key association of judges saying 90 . per cent of its members have voted not to oversee the poll. The . announcement is unlikely to stop the referendum from taking place but . casts further doubt on the legitimacy of the constitutional drafting . process. President . Mohammed Morsi's deputy has said that if there are not enough judges to . oversee the referendum, the vote can be staggered over several days. A . faction of judges loyal to Mr Morsi has said it would not boycott the . vote. Egypt's political . crisis began on November 22 when Morsi issued a decree granting himself - . and the Islamist-dominated panel writing the constitution - immunity . from judicial oversight or challenge. Those decrees sparked mass . demonstrations, with opponents saying they were issued initially to . protect the draft charter from the judiciary. The . constitution has polarized the nation and triggered some of the worst . street violence since Mr Morsi took office in June as Egypt’s first . freely elected president. Egypt's army chief will host national unity talks on Wednesday, seeking to end a growing political and economic crisis. 'We will not speak about politics nor about the referendum. We will sit together as Egyptians,' armed forces chief and Defence Minister Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said at a gathering of army and police officials on Tuesday. The main opposition coalition has yet to decide whether it will participate. Supporters of the constitution include Mr Morsi, his Muslim Brotherhood and ultra-orthodox Salafis. Opponents include a collection of . liberals, leftists and Christians who claim the draft charter restricts . freedoms and gives Islamists vast influence over the running of the . country. In Cairo's Nasr . City district, a Muslim Brotherhood stronghold, tens of thousands of the . president's backers, some of them waving Egyptian flags, rallied in . front of a neighbourhood mosque. ‘I . want the chant of “Morsi” to shake the earth,’ a man on a stage set up . in front of the mosque shouted into a microphone. ‘Alleyway to alleyway, . house to house, the constitution means stability.’ The . crowd grew rapidly as dozens of buses, most of them bearing license . plate numbers from provinces outside of Cairo, offloaded thousands of . Morsi supporters at the venue. Anger: Anti-Morsi demonstrators chant slogans at Tahrir Square as tens of thousands of people take to the street . Demonstration: Protesters are held back by police as they crowd in front of the presidential palace . Division: Anti Morsi protesters wave national flags. Opposition sides held mass rallies for and against the controversial draft constitution . Opposition protestors hold a banner thats reads in Arabic 'no for the referendum on the blood of Egyptians' Destruction: A wall surrounding the presidential palace is dismantled . The crowd denounced the liberal opposition and its leaders, calling them undemocratic and accusing them of being loyalists of Hosni Mubarak, the authoritarian leader who was ousted in a popular uprising last year. ‘Those protesting at the presidential palace are feloul (remnants of the Mubarak regime) and counter-revolutionaries,’ said Mohammed Abdel-Aziz, a young Islamist protester. ‘They don't want Islam.’ Several hundred Islamists also have . set up camp across town outside a media complex that is home to several . independent TV networks critical of Morsi and the Brotherhood. The . Islamists have threatened to storm the facility. In . the nearby Heliopolis neighbourhood, tens of thousands of opposition . supporters rallied outside the presidential palace, pushing their . demands that Mr Morsi scrap the referendum on the charter. With . four days left before the referendum, the opposition has yet to decide . whether to campaign for a ""no"" vote or call for a boycott - something . many see as a reflection of divisions within the opposition. The . disparate opposition groups are led by reformist and Nobel Peace prize . laureate Mohamed ElBaradei, Egypt's former foreign minister and Arab . League chief Amr Moussa, and leftist politician Hamdeen Sabahi. Blocked: Egyptian soldiers prevent protesters moving into the precinct in front of the palace .

On Monday, another key opposition figure, El-Sayed Badawi of the Wafd party, met Mr Morsi at the presidential palace. Mr Badawi later issued a statement saying he remained loyal to the opposition's goals: scrapping the draft charter and postponing the vote. The opposition has rejected any dialogue with Mr Morsi until he shelves the draft constitution and postpones the referendum. They have also demanded that Mr Morsi rescind decrees giving him near absolute powers. He withdrew those powers on Saturday, but insisted that the referendum will go ahead as scheduled. Anticipating unrest on the day of the referendum, Mr Morsi has ordered the military to join the police in maintaining security and protecting state institutions until after the results of the vote are announced.

Non-essential crew on the nearby North Sea Producer, a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, were evacuated to other rigs as a precaution because the disabled boat was drifting. The incident in Sunderland took place at about 1.30pm this afternoon. A total of 15 fisherman were hit by two huge waves, which knocked them off their feet. Bev Allen, watch manager for Humber Coastguard, said: 'We had a number of people on the pier at Roker who were knocked off their feet. One sustained a broken leg and they all had to be evacuated off. 'They were anglers hit by two successive waves which knocked them all over. If anybody had of gone into the water it would have been very dangerous.' The man with the broken leg was winched off the pier by a rescue helicopter while the remaining fisherman were evacuated through a tunnel under the pier. It has now been closed to the public. More than 120 areas across the UK are on flood alert this morning with heavy rain set to lash the country over the weekend. The Environment Agency increased the number of areas at risk overnight as rain continued for a second day. While . the worst affected places are in the South West, 128 areas across the . South East, Midlands, central and northern England, Wales and southern . and central Scotland are also on alert. The . weather has been so severe that pensioners were forced to flee their . homes because of raging coastal floods in Aberdeenshire. High tides and drastic conditions led to 25 people being taken from sheltered housing complexes at Stonehaven. They were taken to St Bridget's Hall in the town, where a rest centre was set up. Further north at Peterhead, about 30 people were evacuated from properties in the Roanheads area. Some stayed with friends while others were given accommodation at a hotel, according to Aberdeenshire Council. People at a care home in Huntly, which . sits inland at the River Deveron, were told to prepare to leave but . later given the all clear. Willie . Munro, of Aberdeenshire Council, said: 'Trained council staff and . emergency services personnel are on hand at St Bridget's Hall to provide . support for the people who have been evacuated. 'High . tide in Stonehaven has passed and, while we continue to monitor the . levels of the River Carron closely, there are currently no concerns that . the river will flood.'

A dog walker braves the waters to find a path alongside the floodwater from Pocklington Canal, Sutton upon Derwent, East Yorkshire . Authorities took the action because of unusually high waters, which also affected other parts of Scotland. In Wick, on the far north coast, roads were closed and fishing boats were damaged in high winds. About 12 cars were moved from a car park when a strong surge breached a river bank, police said. Several roads were closed by debris thrown up by the waves. A further 15 areas across the west, as . well as in Northampton and Warrington, are expected to flood, the . Environment Agency said. Around . 30 commercial properties were flooded yesterday in the coastal town of . Looe, south Cornwall, as a band of heavy rain swept in from the . Atlantic. Tom Tombler, . meteorologist for MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press . Association, said: 'The heavy rain will affect mostly the western parts . of the the UK and southern England as well as Wales. 'The risk of localised flooding remains throughout the day, especially in areas which saw heavy rain yesterday. 'Between 10mm and 20mm is expected in the worst-hit areas. 'Temperatures will remain milder though, around 10C for most areas.' The heavy rain is expected to stay for . the weekend, before a brighter start to the week, he added, although the . rain will return on Thursday. Firefighters praised the speedy actions of three hunters who found a man desperately clinging to a tree following a flash flood. Early this morning crews were called to a brook, near the River Exe in Devon, which had swollen to around 6ft deep. More than 12 firefighters helped rescue the man, who was taken to hospital suffering with hypothermia. The fire service said it believed he had taken a wrong turn while walking back to his home in Exwick, near Exeter, before slipping into the brook. Sean Faulkner, from Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'Luckily there was a group of three gentlemen who were out hunting and they heard his cries, because it was in the middle of nowhere, and they raised the alarm. 'If it wasn't for the swift actions of the men and the crew it could have been a different outcome.' A spokeswoman for Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said crews received a 999 call to the incident at around 1.15am today. She also added the service had received around 10 calls relating to flooding within the past 24 hours. Yesterday Plymouth endured 29mm of rain, while Culdrose in west Cornwall received 21mm in 18 hours. The Environment Agency is still advising people to stay away from seafronts, quaysides and jetties along the south coast to avoid powerful waves. A spokesman said: 'The strong winds and high tides can be quite dangerous for people walking along the coast, with waves breaking on to coastal paths.' The combination of warmer temperatures and flash floods have dashed hopes of a white Christmas. Met Office forecaster George Goodfellow said: 'It’s mild and wet at the moment and it looks unsettled with showers of spells of rain ahead all the way into January, with low pressure for much of the time. 'There’s no signal for a colder spell in the Christmas period. Temperatures are expected to be around average - and snow is rare in the South in late December. 'There’s always a higher chance of snow on hills and mountains in Scotland and the North, but there’s no indication of a widespread wintry spell. 'Rain will be accompanied by strong winds and perhaps gales in exposed northern and western areas at times.'MeteoGroup forecaster John Lee said: . 'Christmas looks unsettled with south-westerly winds keeping it mild.

Disappointed: Dr Helen McGlore, at Edinburgh Court of Session, sued for £20million after two smear tests failed to spot pre-cancerous cells . A woman left unable to have children after a health board failed to spot her cancer has been awarded more than £2million in damages. Helen McGlone, 33, claimed medical negligence ended her prospects of a high-flying career in the financial sector and will force her to use a surrogate mother to have children. But the money given to her for loss of earnings at the Court of Session fell far short of the £20million for which she had sued. In a written ruling issued yesterday, Lord Bannatyne rejected the physics graduate’s claim that a lucrative career was a certainty before her two botched smear tests. Instead, he said her chances of getting a top City job during the financial crash of 2008 were only 30 per cent. Dr McGlone was said to be ‘disappointed’ by the award. She is still seeking compensation from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to pay for a surrogate mother in the US after being forced to undergo a radical  hysterectomy when her cancer was discovered two years too late. Following the decision, she said: ‘I am still working through the detail of what has been published today. ‘Only someone who has suffered a serious cancer and the resulting treatment can truly appreciate the pain, fear and loss that come with it. ‘I was fortunate in that I survived,  but I certainly had to fight hard to do so. This case is about protecting other women from an atrocious, preventable cancer and I will continue to do everything I can for them.' The 33-year-old, who was born in Falkirk, Stirlingshire, had planned to have as many as four children – but was left unable to become a mother by a double medical blunder. She had two cervical smears in 2005 and 2006, both of which failed to spot pre-cancerous cells. Her eventual diagnosis came by accident after she graduated with a particle physics doctorate from Glasgow University and moved to Switzerland to work for the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, CERN. After cutting her hand, she discovered she had medical insurance and, as one of a number of medical checks, was given a smear test. The cancer was caught so late that she was forced to have radical surgery. Her chances of survival during  chemotherapy were given as just over 50 per cent, but she battled through – although she can no longer have children. Then began a long-running legal fight to get the health board to take responsibility for this, ending in a judgment last year that it was to blame. Dr McGlone listened to four weeks of evidence earlier this year on her loss of earnings from the cancer, which she claims has left her with post- traumatic stress disorder and unable to work. Giving evidence, she said she was on the point of getting her first job as a quantitative analyst with a top financial institution. She claims she would have made £15-£20million over the course of her career. Lord Bannatyne ruled at Edinburgh Court of Sessions said the chances of Dr McGlone getting a top City job was just 30 per cent . However, the written judgment revealed she had applied to 12 banks following her diagnosis and had been offered a job by none. Moreover, there are only 600 such posts in London, with women filling only 7 per cent. These considerations led to the compensation figure being downgraded. Lord Bannatyne also said Dr McGlone was a woman who was ‘driven, highly competitive, calculating, committed to getting on and highly focused’ and that he believed she would find other work. Taking into account her suffering, loss of earnings and pension, as well as plastic surgery to cover scars, she was awarded £2,026,750. That may increase following a further hearing on other financial matters. No date has yet been fixed for damages relating to her surrogacy treatment – which, if awarded, would be unprecedented in British courts. Stephen Hay, head of litigation at Gildeas Solicitors, which represented Dr McGlone, said she was considering an appeal. He added: ‘She was initially disappointed when she heard the headline figure. She put forward a case where her income would be £300,000 a year until the age of 55 and to be told her loss of earnings will be £1.7million is clearly a significant difference. ‘But the main thing for her has always been that other women should not have to go through this.’ A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said yesterday that its legal team was still going through the 100-page written judgment and that any further statement at this time would be ‘inappropriate’. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Helen McGlone had two smear tests but pre-cancerous cells not spotted .

Egyptian army officers were seen constructing the third line of the hastily erected barricades around the presidential palace of leader Mohammed Morsi today. The security measures followed threats of protests against President's Morsi's decision not to delay the referendum on his controversial draft constitution, set to be held next Saturday. Hundreds of Egyptians today marched on the presidential palace and the newly build barricades, despite Morsi rescinded a decree that would stop the judiciary challenging his rule. Scroll down for video . Building barricades: A man talks with Egyptian army officers as they construct a third line of concrete blocks outside of the Egyptian presidential palace in Cairo today . His decision to renounce his planned . 'Pharaoh' powers was a desperate bid to end the violence in which at . least seven have died and hundreds have been injured. Liberal and secular opponents say the . framework of the draft constitution is too deeply influenced by Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood party. The ratification of the constitution would seal the democratic transition that began when the country's 2011 uprising saw dictator Hosni Mubarak ousted after three decades of one-man rule. National . Salvation Front leader Ahmed Said called the race to a referendum an . ‘act of war’. His  movement called for a mass protest at the palace in . Cairo. The building was stormed last week by activists angered by the . power grab. Protecting the palace: Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi ordered the barricades to be built after threats of further protests escalated earlier today . Taking it back: Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, pictured yesterday, has announced that he will give up his 'Pharaoh' decree, which granted him near-absolute powers and immunity from courts . The concrete wall is the third . barrier built outside the presidential palace and as hundreds marched on . the palace today Morsi's worried proved not to be unfounded. However, Mori's choice to lift the . decree last night could persuade many judges to drop their two-week . strike to protest against it, which means they would oversee the . referendum as is customary in Egypt. It was the decrees that initially . sparked the wave of protests against Morsi that has brought tens of . thousands into the streets in past weeks. However, the rushed passage of the . constitution further inflamed those who claim Morsi and his Islamist . allies are monopolizing power in . Egypt and trying to force their agenda. The draft charter was adopted amid a boycott by liberal and Christian . members of the Constituent Assembly, meaning not all members voted. The document would open the door to . Egypt's most extensive implementation of Islamic law or Shariah, . enshrining a say for Muslim clerics in legislation, making civil rights . subordinate to Shariah and broadly allowing the state to protect 'ethics . and morals'. It fails to outlaw gender discrimination and mainly refers . to women in relation to home and family. Protect and serve: Egyptian army engineers and soldiers work on the barricades outside the Egyptian presidential palace . In his late night announcement on Saturday, Morsi . replaced the scrapped decrees with a new one that doesn't give him . unrestricted powers, but allows him to give voters an option if they . decide to vote ""no"" on the disputed draft charter. In the new decree, if the . constitution is rejected, Morsi would call for new elections to select . 100-member panel to write a new charter within three months. The new panel would then have up to six months to complete its task, and the president calls for a new referendum with a month. Bassem Sabry, a writer and activist, . called the partial concession a 'stunt' that would embarrass the . opposition by making it look like Morsi was willing to compromise but . not solve the problem. 'In the end, Morsi got everything he . wanted,' he said, pointing out the referendum would be held without the . consensus Morsi had promised to seek and without giving people . sufficient time to study the document. Yesterday Morsi was warned by the . powerful Egyptian army that ‘anything other than dialogue will force us . into a dark tunnel with disastrous consequences.’ The statement, broadcast on Egyptian . state TV was attributed to an anonymous official who promised the . military would not allow this to happen. Planning president: Behind the barricades, inside his palace, President Morsi prepares his next move after Egyptian army leaders gave an ultimatum to him and the opposition to hold talks . Good idea: The building works may have been justified as it was reported that several hundreds of Egyptians marched on the palace to protest against the vote on the draft constitution next Saturday .","President build third concrete wall to protect the palace from protestors .

His brother Matthew, right, hanged himself in March after splitting with a girlfreind . The family is today being comforted by relatives and friends following Jonny's funeral as they try to come to terms with the double tragedy. Caryn, 56, said the family was in 'complete shock' and said that Jonny was schizophrenic. She said: 'It’s the total devastation of it all. We have had children . everywhere for years and we would come home and think ‘I can’t cope with . all this'.' 'Now you don’t want to come home because there’s nothing here, it’s so quiet.' 'You . think ‘When are they coming home?’ or you lie awake at 3am and think . ‘They are going to ring up for a lift home soon’ but they don’t.'

Friends: The boys' mother Caryn Watson, 56, said Jonny had 'struggled' since his older brother committed suicide in March . She said Jonny had 'struggled' after his brother Matthew committed suicide eight months ago because the pair enjoyed a close relationship. 'We feel we have done our level best for Jonny but he got increasingly unable to cope. It all mounted up and up,' Mrs Watson added.

'The three of them have always been together and wherever they were, they would keep in touch. Jonny was previously admitted to the Melbury Lodge mental health unit near the family home but was returned home after a six-week stay. The couple urged other people suffering from depression to talk to family and friends about their problems. Mrs Watson said: 'We were always there for him but Jonny would not talk to people about things. It’s been so difficult to come to terms with. It’s so bad and it’s so tragic and it affects so many people’s lives. 'If anybody feels that desperately low or feels they’re stuck in a situation they need to talk about it. We’ve had five children and we’ve always tried to be open with them and we’ve always been there for all of them.' She thanked friends and neighbors for their 'wonderful support', adding: 'John . went to the shop the other day and the woman behind the counter said .

A growing majority of Americans think global warming is occurring, that it will become a serious problem and that the U.S. government should do something about it, a new Associated Press-GfK poll finds. Even most people who say they don't trust scientists on the environment say temperatures are rising. The poll found 4 out of every 5 Americans said climate change will be a serious problem for the United States if nothing is done about it. That's up from 73 per cent when the same question was asked in 2009. Rising concern: A growing majority of Americans think global warming is occurring, that it will become a serious problem and that the U.S. government should do something about it, a new poll finds . Changing views: Even most people who say they don't trust scientists on the environment say temperatures are rising. And 57 per cent of Americans say the U.S. government should do a great deal or quite a bit about the problem. That's up from 52 per cent in 2009. Only 22 per cent of those surveyed think little or nothing should be done, a figure that dropped from 25 per cent. Overall, 78 per cent of those surveyed said they believe temperatures are rising, up from 75 per cent three years earlier. In general, U.S. belief in global warming, according to AP-GfK and other polls, has fluctuated over the years but has stayed between about 70 and 85 per cent. The biggest change in the polling is among people who trust scientists only a little or not at all. About 1 in 3 of the people surveyed fell into that category. Within that highly sceptical group, 61 per cent now say temperatures have been rising over the past 100 years. A visible indicator: Scientists believe that Greenland with its melting ice caps and disappearing glaciers, is an accurate thermometer of global warming . Scientists say: This chart shows some of the believed impacts of global warming . That's a substantial increase from 2009, when the AP-GfK poll found that only 47 per cent of those with little or no trust in scientists believed the world was getting warmer. This is an important development because, often in the past, opinion about climate change doesn't move much in core groups — like those who deny it exists and those who firmly believe it's an alarming problem, said Jon Krosnick, a Stanford University social psychologist and pollster. Krosnick, who consulted with The Associated Press on the poll questions, said the changes the poll shows aren't in the hard-core ‘anti-warming’ deniers, but in the next group, who had serious doubts. ‘They don't believe what the scientists say, they believe what the thermometers say,’ Krosnick said. ‘Events are helping these people see what scientists thought they had been seeing all along.’ Phil Adams, a retired freelance photographer from Washington, North Carolina, said he was ‘fairly cynical’ about scientists and their theories. But he believes very much in climate change because of what he's seen with his own eyes. Passing by: A fishing boat passes by icebergs floating in the Jacobshavn Bay on August 26, 2007 near the town of Ilulissat, Greenland . ‘Having lived for 67 years, we consistently see more and more changes based upon the fact that the weather is warmer,’ he said. ‘The seasons are more severe. The climate is definitely getting warmer.’‘Storms seem to be more severe,’ he added. Nearly half, 49 per cent, of those surveyed called global warming not just serious but ‘very serious,’ up from 42 per cent in 2009. More than half, 57 per cent, of those surveyed thought the U.S. government should do a great deal or quite a bit about global warming, up from 52 per cent three years earlier. But only 45 per cent of those surveyed think President Barack Obama will take major action to fight climate change in his second term, slightly more than the 41 per cent who don't think he will act. Overall, the 78 per cent who think temperatures are rising is not the highest percentage of Americans who have believed in climate change, according to AP polling. In 2006, less than a year after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, 85 per cent thought temperatures were rising. Floating ice: An icebergs floats in the Jacobshavn Bay on August 27, 2007 near the town of Ilulissat, Greenland . The lowest point in the past 15 years for belief in warming was in December 2009, after some snowy winters and in the middle of an uproar about climate scientists' emails that later independent investigations found showed no manipulation of data. Broken down by political party, 83 per cent of Democrats and 70 per cent of Republicans say the world is getting warmer. And 77 per cent of independents say temperatures are rising. Among scientists who write about the issue in peer-reviewed literature, the belief in global warming is about 97 per cent, according to a 2010 scientific study. About 1 in 4 people surveyed think that efforts to curb global warming would hurt the American economy, a figure down slightly from 27 per cent in 2009 when the economy was in worse shape. Just under half, 46 per cent, think such action would help the U.S. economy, about the same as said so three years ago. The AP-GfK poll was conducted November 29 to December 3 by GfK Roper Public Affairs and Corporate Communications. It involved landline and cell phone interviews with 1,002 adults nationwide. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points; the margin of error is larger for subgroups. The latest AP-GfK poll jibes with other surveys and more in-depth research on global warming, said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of Yale University's Project on Climate Change Communication. He took no part in the poll.mets0ryankies . When climate change belief was at its lowest, concerns about the economy were heightened and the country had gone through some incredible snowstorms and that may have chipped away at some belief in global warming, Leiserowitz said. Now the economy is better and the weather is warmer and worse in ways that seem easier to connect to climate change, he said. ‘One extreme event after another after another,’ Leiserowitz said. ‘People have noticed... They're connecting the dots between climate change and this long bout of extreme weather themselves.’ Thomas Coffey, 77, of Houston, said you can't help but notice it. ‘We use to have mild temperatures in the fall going into winter months. Now, we have summer temperatures going into winter,’ Coffey said. ‘The whole Earth is getting warmer and when it gets warmer, the ice cap is going to melt and the ocean is going to rise.’ He also said that's what he thinks is causing recent extreme weather. ‘That's why you see New York and New Jersey,’ he said, referring to Superstorm Sandy and its devastation in late October. ‘When you have a flood like that, flooding tunnels like that. And look at how long the tunnel has been there.’ First-hand observer: A Greenlandic Inuit hunter and fisherman steers his boat past a melting iceberg, along a fjord leading away from the edge of the Greenland ice sheet .","A recent poll found 4 out of every 5 Americans .

Police could soon be armed with handcuffs that deliver an electric shock to arrested people who refuse to go quietly. A U.S. firm has applied for a patent for a new kind of restraint that can literally shock detainees into submission if they refuse to cooperate. The design is not limited to handcuffs, but also could be applied equally to ankle cuffs, straight jackets, restraining belts, neck collars and even facial restraints. 'The augmented detainee restraint': Police could . soon be armed with handcuffs that are able to administer electric . shocks to prisoners. An image from the patent filing is pictured above . And the company behind it envision not only delivering electric shocks, but also provide for systems that could administer sedative drugs to those held captive. The idea is likely to shock civil liberties groups and could spark a new debate regarding how far force can be legitimately used to keep detainees quiet. Patent Bolt, which first broke the story, commented: 'Whether you're in law enforcement or in an activist group, it's an interesting read that will keep your interest. 'Yes, the cuffs are designed to restrain ""the bad guys,"" but it sure looks as though there's potential here for abuse in the form of mild torture. 'This kind of invention will have to be carefully monitored and legislated to exacting standards so that the ""good guys"" walk the line on this one.' Schematic: The cuffs could be controlled . internally using various sensors that detect when the person locked in . them starts to misbehave, or they could be externally activated by a . guard . U.S. Patent Application 20120298119 describes a 'system for restraining detainees through devices attached to the detainees and configured to administer electrical shocks when certain predetermined conditions occur.' The cuffs, developed by Arizona-based firm Scottsdale Inventions, could be controlled internally using various sensors that indicate when the person locked in them starts to misbehave. Alternatively, whoever is guarding the captive could choose when to administer electric shocks, or a signal could be sent automatically when, for example, the detainee moves beyond a certain range. According to the patent application, safety mechanisms could be included in the control mechanism of the cuffs to stop the detainee from receiving too much current too quickly. In one embodiment, it could be equipped with sensors to determine just how much electrical current a detainee can take, so that they are not inadvertently killed by the device. For example, if the sensors determine that the captive has a health issue like a weak heart, a warning could be issued to the person or system controlling the device. Boundary control: The device could also be linked to a sensor that can automatically deliver an electric shock to its wearer when they move inside or outside a predetermined perimeter . A further feature of the device envisioned by Scottsdale inventions is a drug delivery system that, according to the patent filing, could administer 'an irritant, a medication, a sedative, a transdermal medication or transdermal enhancers such as dimethyl sulfoxide, a chemical restraint, a paralytic, a medication prescribed to the detainee, and combinations thereof'. This could word either by means of a moveable needle or gas injection system, the patent says, and could be in addition or in place of electric shocks. The patent includes a number of schematic-type drawings of the planned device. However it also includes one image that stood out as appearing like a photograph of an actual prototype, suggesting that electric handcuffs could be available to a police force near you soon.","Arizona-based company has applied to patent the technology .

Ed Miliband is under fire on immigration after he dropped an admission that Labour’s open door policy had left communities across Britain ‘struggling to cope’. His spin doctors had briefed the media that he would admit that Labour’s failure to control immigration had damaged Britain and increased community tensions. He had been expected to say: ‘We did too little to tackle the realities of segregation in communities that were struggling to cope.’ 'Mistakes': Labour leader Ed Miliband admitted his party failed to tackle the growing problem of segregation while it was in power but dropped an admission that Labour's open door policy left communities 'struggling to cope' The Labour leader used a speech at Samaj Hall in Tooting to suggest money used for translating leaflets would be better spent on English lessons . The frank admission led news bulletins on the BBC and newspaper websites for much of the day. But Mr Miliband then dropped it from his speech, merely repeating a vague acknowledgment that the party had made ‘mistakes’ on immigration when in Government. The Labour leader called for a new strategy to help millions of immigrants integrate with British society. But he was silent on ways to control immigration levels in future. Senior Tories last night called on Mr Miliband to apologise for Labour’s record on immigration. David Cameron challenged Mr Miliband to support government policies to curb immigration . David Cameron said the last government, in which Mr Miliband was a Cabinet minister, had left behind an immigration system in ‘complete and utter meltdown’. He challenged the Labour leader to drop his opposition to the Government’s immigration cap and its crackdown on bogus students. Mr Miliband’s speech came days after the results of the 2011 census showed that the number of people born abroad and living in the UK had increased by almost four million in ten years. There are now around one million households where no one speaks English. Labour insisted Mr Miliband ‘stands by’ the omitted section of his speech and had simply forgotten to say it. Yesterday’s speech on immigration was designed to toughen the party’s image on an issue where it persistently trails the Tories in the polls. Mr Miliband acknowledged ‘deep anxiety’ about the scale of immigration, which resulted from Labour’s decision not to put controls on immigration from eastern Europe. He said: ‘The capacity of our economy to absorb new migrants has outrun the capacity of some of our communities to adapt. The last Labour government made mistakes in this regard.’ He outlined plans for a ‘comprehensive strategy’ to improve integration, including requiring applicants for certain public sector jobs, such as care work, to speak English. He called for spending on English language teaching for migrants to be prioritised and said more affordable housing should be built to end the situation where migrants were exploited by unscrupulous landlords. Segregation: The release of the 2011 census this week revealed the multi-ethnic nature of modern Britain . Since the previous census in 2001 there has been an unprecedented surge in the number of immigrants coming to this country. There are now 7.5 million people living in England and Wales who were born abroad .","Leader dropped admission that party's open door policy left communities 'struggling to cope'

Nyasasaurus parringtoni would have been alive 10 to 15 million years before any previously known dinosaurs - and more than 150million years before the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex. The size of a Labrador and slight of build, Nyasasaurus had a five foot-long tail and likely walked upright on two legs. Nyasasaurus parringtoni, either the earliest dinosaur or the closest dinosaur relative yet discovered. It was up to three metres long, and similar in size to a golden retriever . The fossilized upper arm and six . vertebrae date from just a few million years after the 'Permo-Triassic . mass extinction', the greatest of all time, and provide important . insight into the origin and early evolution of dinosaurs. All life on Earth today is descended . from the four per cent of species that survived the mysterious event 250 . million years ago that may have been caused by an asteroid impact or . volcanic eruptions. The researchers said: 'We can say, . with confidence, the lineage leading to dinosaurs evolved by the . Anisian, the early part of the Middle Triassic epoch, approximately 243 . million years ago.' With only a few ribs and arm bones to go on, the scientists can't be sure what the world's oldest dinosaur ate. However, it is likely it had a similar diet to other early dinosaurs of small prey, insects and plants. The fossilised bones were collected during a Cambridge University expedition to Tanzania in the 1930s and gradually examined over the decades by Natural History Museum palaeontologist Alan Charig. He requested that the work be continued on his death and the full details have now been published. Dr Paul Barrett, a NHM dinosaur expert who took part in the study, said: 'We don't know if it walked on two legs or four legs but our prediction is that it's two legs and the reason is that the majority of early dinosaurs are two-legged animals. 'We don't know what it ate because we don't have any of the teeth of skull. 'But other early dinosaurs had a mixed diet.' The remains do, however, allow for its size to be estimated. Nyasasaurus is believed to have been 6.5 to 10ft from nose to tail, with its tail accounting for half of that. Its slight build means it would have lived 'in the shadow' of other much larger reptiles alive at the time. The humerus, or upper arm bone, of Nyasasaurus parringtoni next to a cross section of the bone. The many colors indicate that the bone fibers are disorganized, much like those of early dinosaurs. University of Washington researcher Dr Sterling Nesbitt said: 'If the newly named Nyasasaurus parringtoni is not the earliest dinosaur, then it is the closest relative found so far. 'Nyasasaurus establishes that dinosaurs likely evolved earlier than previously expected and refutes the idea that dinosaur diversity burst onto the scene in the Late Triassic, a burst of diversification unseen in any other groups at that time.' It may not be correct to say . dinosaurs originated in Tanzania because when Nyasasaurus lived the . world’s continents were joined in the landmass called Pangaea. Tanzania would have been part of Southern Pangaea that included Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia. Dr Paul Barrett, of the Natural History Museum in London, . said: 'The new findings place the early evolution of dinosaurs and . dinosaur like reptiles firmly in the southern continents. The specimen, which is detailed in the Royal Society Journal Biology Letters, is stored in London at the Natural History Museum. Remains of a second of the creatures are kept in Cape Town. Nyasasaurus parringtoni is named after the African lake Nyasa (also known as Lake Malawi) and Rex Parrington, the Cambridge University palaeontologist who collected the specimen in the 1930s. Bones of Nyasasaurus parringtoni were collected in southwest Tanzania in the 1930s from the Manda beds, which preserves fossils of many animals from the Triassic Period of Earth's history. Paul Barrett of London's Natural History Museum, part of the team who made the new discovery, excavates a skeleton of a prosauropod dinosaur near Lady Grey, South Africa . The bones of the new animal reveal a number of characteristics common to early dinosaurs and their close relatives. For example, the bone tissues in the upper arm bone appear as if they are woven haphazardly and not laid down in an organised way indicating rapid growth, a common feature of dinosaurs. Biologist Sarah Werning, of the University of California, Berkeley, who did the bone analysis, said: 'We can tell from the bone tissues Nyasasaurus had a lot of bone cells and blood vessels. 'In living animals, we only see this many bone cells and blood vessels in animals that grow quickly, like some mammals or birds. 'The bone tissue of Nyasasaurus is exactly what we would expect for an animal at this position on the dinosaur family tree. 'It is a very good example of a transitional fossil; the bone tissue shows Nyasasaurus grew about as fast as other primitive dinosaurs, but not as fast as later ones.' Another example is the upper arm bone’s distinctively enlarged crest, needed to anchor the upper arm muscles. The feature, known as an elongated deltopectoral crest, is also common to all early dinosaurs.","Nyasasaurus parringtoni is more than 10 million years older than previously discovered dinosaurs .

When Avril Rowlands, 67, and husband Christopher, 68, bought the small pine tree for just £6 from a garden centre in 1978 they hardly expected it to be standing higher than 40ft tall 34 years later. The couple planted the 6ft tree outside their new home in the village of Inkberrow, Worcestershire, and took a photograph to commemorate the occasion. Through the years: Avril and Christopher Rowlands planted the tree when it stood at just 6ft tall after moving to their new home 34 years ago . Standing tall: The tree now towers over the couple's home after growing to more than 40ft tall . Small beginnings: The couple bought the tree for £6 and took a picture to commemorate the occasion . But after more than 30 years of dedicated care it is still standing proud at 42 ft tall, and it is still growing. The tree has become so big it now towers over the couple's home and has become a focal point for the local community. Each year it is decorated with more than 1,000 traditional tungsten bulbs using a cherry picker loaned by a local firm. And for the last three years the couple have held on switch-on event which many villagers now see at the start of the festive period. Television writer Avril said: 'My husband and I moved up to the village from London in 1978 for a more meaningful life. 'We saw that the local post office had a Christmas tree which was covered in fairy lights and it really stood out.

But animal lovers have fewer reasons to shop there following the supermarket’s festive advert featuring a child feeding Christmas Pudding to the family dog. Vets warned that dried fruit in the cake could cause acute renal failure and death in dogs if left untreated and branded the supermarket ‘irresponsible’ for showing the advert. Campaigners have now set up a Facebook page and have complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the advert, saying it encourages people to feed Christmas pudding to dogs. Scroll down to watch video . 'Not everyone loves traditional Christmas pud': A child in the Morrisons advert looks suspiciously at some Christmas pudding placed on his plate . Sneaky: When no one is looking, the child lifts up the Christmas pudding and starts to lower it beneath the table . The 20-second clip shows a young boy being handed a plate with a slice of the pudding that he then passes to his little brother who then passes it to the family dog under the table. The advert, which showcases Morrisons’ alternative Christmas desserts, features the voiceover saying: ‘Not everyone loves traditional Christmas pud’. Although the dog deposits the Christmas pudding in the plant pot, the advert suggests that dogs can eat the dessert, despite the dangers which are well-known to dog-lovers, according to campaigners. Paula Boyden, veterinary director of the Dogs Trust, said any advert that suggested feeding Christmas pudding to dogs was ‘irresponsible’. She said: ‘We don’t know exactly why it is toxic, but if dogs eat dried fruit they will suffer vomiting, diarrhoea, weakness and lethargy and eventually acute renal failure if it isn’t treated. ‘There’s always a risk around Christmas time with Christmas puddings, Christmas cake and chocolate. Christmas is a bit of a minefield for dogs. ‘If you do think your dog has consumed dried fruit, you need to seek immediate veterinary attention. The vet may then induce vomiting in the dog to get rid of the food before they absorb it. Going, going, gone: The child successfully manages to hide the pudding underneath the table . Warning: Vets and animal charities are unhappy that the advert shows the boy handing the pudding to a dog as dried fruit is toxic to animals . ‘The bottom line is that dried fruits are very, very toxic and they could end up costing you your dog’s life.’ She warned owners not to feed their pets raisins, sultanas, currants, dates, grapes, mince pies, Christmas pudding, alcohol, onion, raw green potato, turkey (or any other) bones and chocolate. Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today Magazine (ALL CORR), said her readers had been outraged the moment they saw the advert and demanded Morrisons stop showing the advert and apologise. She said: ‘We received a number of complaints about the advert the minute it aired. ‘Everyone knows about the danger of giving dogs chocolate but I’m not sure that people know the dangers of the dried fruit in Christmas pudding. ‘All you need is a child to watch it, to give the pudding to a less fussy dog than the one in the advert and the animal could suffer renal failure and die. ‘It would have been nice if they had consulted a vet or a welfare group before filming this advert, or even a dog owner as most of them are well aware of the problems with dried fruit.’ She said the advert showed a little boy ‘poisoning’ his pet dog, adding: ‘It’s like giving a dog Warfarin. It really is that bad.’ 'Misleading': The dog then deposits the Christmas pudding in a plant pot but campaigners argue the advert makes it seem the dessert is not dangerous to dogs . Minimal risk: A Morrisons spokesman said that vets advised the supermarket there would be minimal, if any, risks to a dog from eating a small amount of Christmas pudding . Critics have now set up a Facebook page where people can give their opinions on the advert: https://www.facebook.com/MorrisonsChristmasPuddingTvAdCouldKill . Two years ago, John Lewis caused controversy when their Christmas advert featured a shot of the family dog out in the howling wind and snow in a kennel that was too small for it. Outraged campaigners said the shots of the wolfhound sitting in the kennel set a bad example to other owners and encouraged animal cruelty. The company apologised and cut the clip from some of their adverts. Morrisons are continuing to show the advert. Ms Cuddy added: ‘John Lewis got it in the neck for what their Christmas advert about the dog. It set animal welfare back about 50 years because everyone thought that if it’s ok for John Lewis, it’s ok for everyone. ‘By the same logic, Morrison are telling us that children who don’t like Christmas pudding should give it to the dog. It’s very irresponsible.’ Peter Jones, President of the British Veterinary Association, said: ‘It is vital that advertisers use animals responsibly and we are disappointed to see the Morrisons Christmas desserts TV commercial depicting a small boy feeding Christmas pudding to his dog. ‘Christmas pudding, Christmas cake and mince pies - because they contain raisins or sultanas - are potentially harmful to pets and in some cases can lead to kidney failure.

Long suffering: The mother buys all the presents, while the father is largely absent in the Asda advert . ‘While we accept that many pet owners understand what is and what is not appropriate to feed their pets, children watch adverts and can be easily influenced by what they see. ‘Veterinary organisations and animal welfare charities work really hard to promote messages about responsible pet ownership and TV adverts such as this one, with huge audiences, can undermine this work.’ So far, 40 people have complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the clip.Dog-lover Jan Yates posted a comment on the Facebook page saying: ‘My grandchildren (3, 3 and 6) constantly copy things they see on the TV, particularly the little ones. ‘As we can’t watch them 24/7 I feel this is incredibly irresponsible of Morrisons. ‘Had they put their hands up to it straight away I would forgive sloppy research, but to continue with the ad is arrogance personified.’ Emma Judson said: ‘Imagine the advert said some people don’t like Advocaat and showed Grandma handing a glass of the horrible stuff to the toddler who then pours it into a plant pot...’ A Morrisons spokesman said: ‘We know that many of our customers are dog lovers and we would never run any advert that encouraged poor pet care. ‘We were therefore careful to seek veterinary advice prior to filming the advert and ensured we had a vet present during filming. ‘The veterinary advice we received concluded that there would be minimal, if any, risk to a dog of serious toxic reaction should a small amount, in relation to its body weight, of Christmas cake or pudding be consumed on a one-off basis.’ The spokesman added that the advice was that there would only be a risk of toxicity if a dog ate raw fruits weighing 1 - 2.5lbs - a figure that vets said was inaccurate.

ESPN pundit and sports commentator Rob Parker has been criticised for his controversial and racially charged remarks about Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III. Speaking on the sports broadcaster's morning show 'First Take', Parker, who is African-American asked if the former Heisman Trophy winner is 'a brother or a cornball brother?' Rushing to distance themselves from the growing race row, ESPN said that the comments were 'Inappropriate' and that they would 'evaluate its next step.' Scroll Down for Video . Suspended: Rob Parker made the controversial comments on ESPN's sports show 'First Take' on Thursday morning . Questioned: Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III pictured on December 9, watching the end of the game against the Baltimore Ravens . Parker, 48, a former Detroit News columnist openly questioned the blackness of Robert Griffin III and claimed that he was not an authentic representative of the black community. Speaking live on air, host Stephen A. Smith immediately answered back to Parker, 'What does that mean?' Parker then launched into a confused diatribe about the rising star quarterback's color. 'Well, he's black, he kind of does his thing,' said Parker. 'But he's not really down with the cause, he's not one of us. He's kind of black. But he's not really the guy you'd really want to hang out with because he's off to do something else.' Bayliss pushed Parker along with other members of the panel to explain himself. 'Because that's how I - I want to find out about him. I don't know because I keep hearing these things. We all know he has a white fiance,' said Parker.

People got a little wondering about him early on.' Having spoken about his fiance and his racial roots, Parker was then prompted into talking about the man's hair. 'Now that's different. Because to me, that's very urban and makes you feel like - I think he would have a clean cut, if he was more straight-laced or not like - wearing braids is, you're a brother. You're a brother if you got braids on.' Parker's questions came one day after Griffin answered questions about the relationship between his race and his career and identity.

A builder today unveiled Britain's most luxurious treehouse, which cost £60,000 to make and comes complete with log burner, 60-inch plasma TV and even a hot tub. Chris Whalley created the incredible hideaway in Blean, Kent, over seven months, crafting it almost entirely from driftwood gathered from a nearby beach. The holiday home has plumbing and electricity and comes with all the creature comforts of a five-star hotel, with a rustic decor that works in harmony with its natural setting. Reaching for the sky: Chris Whalley with his luxury Treehouse Hideaway, which he has spent £60,000 on building over seven months . Rustic look: The businessman used scrap wood . from a builders' merchants and driftwood from Whitstable beach to . construct the home . Stylish living: The cabin promises the finest Egyptian cotton linen, Waters and Noble bathrobes and towels and top of the range kitchen crockery . Handcrafted: Some pieces of furniture in the house are worth more than £1,500 each . Bathing in style: An elevated hot tub backs up Mr Walley's claim that this is the most deluxe treehouse in Britain . Entrancing: The jacuzzi is the ultimate luxury additions to the magical space . The impressive construction sits a staggering 20ft above the ground, making it the tallest habitable tre house in Britain - and the most deluxe. Talented Mr Whalley, who runs a holiday letting business, started designing his high-tech treehouse on a computer in March this year. To keep costs down, he used scraps of wood from a builders' merchant and piles of driftwood collected from nearby Whitstable beach. He built the cabin largely without the help of any scaffolding, by shimmying up and down the tree with ropes. Mr Whalley and wife Michelle, 48, who have six children, also salvaged enough scrap materials to build cupboards, a table and bed. The finished product now proudly sits around a 25ft red cedar tree among the holiday log cabins Mr and Mrs Whalley built six years ago. Stunning view: The hideaway is the tallest habitable treehouse in Britain at 20ft from the ground . Resourceful: The grandfather of four shimmied up and down ropes to build the luxury getaway from builders' scrap wood and driftwood from Whitstable beach . Inspired: The businessman came up with the idea when a little girl staying in one of his log cabins tried to climb a tree . Almost every feature in the house, including the tree trunk sink and the concrete wood-effect kitchen worktop are one of a kind bespoke items worth more than £1,500. The cabin promises the finest Egyptian cotton linen, Waters and Noble bath robes and towels and top of the range kitchen crockery. The grandfather of four revealed he was inspired to build the luxury home after a little girl on holiday in one of his lets nagged him for a tree house. He said: 'One night me and Michelle were staying in the log cabin, and sat in the hot tub with a glass of wine and I said ""I'm bored"" - I needed something to do. 'I said I wanted to build a treehouse at the top of the garden and that was it. 'I built it from scratch. It was a bit ambitious and I'm glad it's over - it's half-killed me. Fantasy home: The unusual dwelling sits on top of a 25ft cedar tree, but has all the amenities of a 5* hotel . Penthouse views: It overlooks animal enclosures at Druidstone Wildlife park near Canterbury . Reaching for the stars: Mr Whalley designed the high-tech treehouse on a computer in March this year . 'There are several treehouses in Britain, but none that are habitable. 'People often have to go abroad to France if they want to stay in one. We have had nothing but good responses so far.' Mr Whalley first had the idea for his tree house two years ago when a family with young children came to stay in one of his log cabins. One of the young girls was trying to climb the tree and Mr Whalley told her it wasn't safe, but if she came back next year he would build her a treehouse. Last year, the holidaymakers returned to the log cabin and it had a children's treehouse for their youngsters to play in. Bespoke: The tree-trunk sink, pictured, and wood-effect worktop make the special home utterly unique . Booking up: A decorator helps add the thoughtful touches to the already wildly popular hideaway . Inspired, Mr Whalley then decided he could do more with the sturdy tree and started his luxury project. The couple's dreams were almost dashed before they got off the ground after Blean Parish Council received several complaints and objections. But the couple took the objections on board before the application was sent to Canterbury City Council planning committee. The couple were then given the go ahead for their luxury holiday let in October 2011 and began building in March 2012. The treehouse, which overlooks animal enclosures at Druidstone Wildlife park near Canterbury was completed in October. Mr Whalley said: 'Everyone who returned to the site said they loved the children's tree house and it was a pity that they couldn't stay in there. Bookings are now taking being taken with customers from as far away as Australia and the U.S. branching out for the added luxury. The treehouse, is available for between £150 and £200 a night, has already scored an impressive five-star score on its TripAdvisor reviews.","Chris Whalley created the luxury treehouse over seven months .

Sixteen years ago tennis player Andrea Jaeger was so touched by the devastating massacre of 16 children at Dunblane, Scotland, in 1996 that she flew 5,000 miles to help and helped inspire U.S. Open champion Andy Murray. Today she unfortunately found herself once again at the scene of a brutal school shooting as she arrived to lay flowers at the makeshift memorial of Sandy Hook Elementary. Speaking of her humanitarian work with her Little Star foundation, Andrea, 47, said she hoped that one child from the tragic Connecticut school could one day emulate Murray. Comfort: Andrea Jaeger arrives to place flowers and a candle at the makeshift memorial in Newtown, Connecticut . Healing process: Andrea Jaeger (center) traveled to Scotland to comfort survivors of the Dunblane massacre, including current world number three Andy Murray (second from right) 'I was helping the recovery relief of Sandy in Staten Island when I heard of the shooting,' said Angela. 'Sandy Hook and Dunblane are so similar in a way - they are both close knit communities, so rural and quiet. 'They have both been hit so badly by the tragedies they have both endured.' Arriving to offer the elementary school any assistance she can, Andrea hopes to be as important to the community's recovery as she was to Dunblane and Andy Murray. Dunblane tragedy: Children weep as they are led away from the school where gunman Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher in Dunblane, Scotland, in 1996 . Jaeger prays at the scene of Friday's shooting . 'I arrived around one week after the . attack and brought as many tennis rackets as I could with me from . Colorado,' said Andrea (who was a former world number two and retired in . 1987). 'The kids were shaken up, but some like Andy who had to hide (during the shootings) were quiet and seemed haunted. 'We set up a net and a court, and we played a game of tennis. 'Andy . was already playing tennis by then and he definitely had an idea of how . to hold a grip and he successfully passed me on the court. 'He was small but pretty good. 'Of course he had to hide during the attack (carried out by the 43-year-old gunman Thomas Hamilton) and a lot of people didn't really know till recently that he was even there during the massacre.' U.S. tennis champion Andy Murray was forced to hide in his classroom during the Dunblane massacre . The funeral of a five-year-old David Kerr in Dunblane in 1996. Andrea Jaeger believes that communities can come together to heal but that the tragedy will 'never leave' the children involved . Andrea said that she believes Andy expressed himself on court and now that hopes one day a child from Sandy Hook could go on to be as successful. Murray is current world number three and won the 2012 U.S. Open in September. 'He has only recently begun to discuss the events of 16 years ago,' said Andrea. 'Did I know then that he would go on to win Olympic Gold and the U.S. Open?' Andrea asked herself. 'No,' she admits, before adding that she saw Murray's mother Judy 2 years ago, who thanked Jaeger for what she did. Saying that she knows from her experience with Dunblane that the tragedy will never leave the children, Andrea hopes the community can come together to heal. 'How we react to this is something personal,' said Andrea. 'I came to lay flowers and offer my help. 'One boy from Dunblane told me he had to hide while blood dropped onto his head. That never leaves you - but I still get letters from kids from the school.' Asked if she thought Andy Murray would come to visit Sandy Hook, Andrea said she believed that people in Connecticut were in his thoughts. 'I think Andy has had enough - but I know he is thinking of them all.' On 13 March 1996, unemployed former shopkeeper Thomas Hamilton, 43, walked into the Dunblane Primary School armed with four handguns. He shot and killed 16 children and one adult before committing suicide. Future tennis champion . Andy Murray attended the school at the time and was forced to take cover . in a classroom. Murray has previously stated that he was too young to . understand what was happening and is reluctant to talk about it in . interviews. In his autobiography Hitting Back he . states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his . mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car. Hamilton entered the school and made his way to the gymnasium where he opened fire on a class of five- and six-year-olds, killing or wounding all but one person. Fifteen children died together with their class teacher, Gwen Mayor, who was killed trying to protect the children. Hamilton then left the gymnasium and shot into a mobile classroom, where children were hiding under tables. Hamilton then shot at children in the corridor, injuring a teacher. He then returned to the gym and killed himself. Eleven children and three adults were rushed to the hospital. Another child was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. Following the tragedy at Dunblane the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 and the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997 were enacted, which effectively made private ownership of handguns illegal in the United Kingdom.","Former world number 2 tennis player Andrea Jaeger traveled to Scotland after 16 children shot in Dunblane school massacre in 1996 .

Just one day after the 'plague ship' arrived back in the UK, a second cruise liner hit by the norovirus vomiting illness has docked in the same port. The Azura arrived in Southampton this morning with passengers suffering from the bug after the Oriana initially brought 300 to the port with the illness yesterday. The latest ship, which has been carrying 3,059 passengers on an 11-night Iberia cruise, was due to leave later for a 12-night Christmas cruise to the Canaries. Sea sick: The Azura cruiseliner has brought ten people back to the UK with the norovirus bug following the 300 sufferers on yesterday's Oriana . Luxury: The atrium at the heart of the Azura has been billed as one of the ship's main features . Ten of those on the cruise which has just ended however have been struck down by the winter vomiting bug. P&O Cruises said: 'There has been an incidence of a mild gastrointestinal illness among the passengers on Azura. 'This illness is suspected to be norovirus, which is highly contagious and typically transmitted from person to person. 'Norovirus is common throughout the UK, Europe and North America and has affected a number of schools, hospitals, nursing homes and children’s day care centres.' Another P&O liner, the Oriana, was yesterday dubbed 'a plague ship' after around 300 passengers were struck by the virus. The ship, which carries 1,843 passengers, returned to Southampton yesterday from a 10-day Baltic cruise and left last night for a 23-night cruise in the eastern Mediterranean. 'Holiday from hell': Passengers arrived back from the Oriana cruise ship on Friday after hundreds were struck down with the vomiting bug . Hundreds of passengers who paid up to £1,429 for the Baltic tour of Christmas markets were struck down by the winter vomiting bug on the fateful cruise. Large parts of the ship were closed off to avoid the virus spreading further and passengers were quarantined as many were sick in corridors, theatres and restaurants. Those who fell ill were ordered to stay in their cabins and miss stop offs as the crew battled to contain the highly contagious virus, which also causes diarrhoea. 'Nightmare': Large parts of the Oriana were closed off to avoid the virus spreading any further . During the cruise, passenger Paul Gilman, 62, told the Daily Mail: 'People were falling like flies, yet the crew were trying to insist everything was fine. 'Everyone is saying, ‘this is a plague ship’. It’s a living nightmare.' Birmingham City Hospital yesterday told visitors to stay away after it was forced to close three wards due to the norovirus infection. Other hospitals have also taken to Twitter to caution visitors and potential patients. Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust tweeted: 'Please don't visit hospital until at least 2 days after last symptoms of #vomiting #diarrhoea #norovirus Stay home, rest & take fluids.' Recent figures from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) show more than 750,000 people could be affected by the outbreak of norovirus that has swept the UK. There have been 2,630 confirmed reports of norovirus so far this season, but for every reported case there are likely to be a further 288 unreported sufferers, the HPA said. It means 757,440 people could be affected by the stomach bug - representing a 72 per cent increase on the same period last year. The infection has led to the closure of dozens of hospital wards. Norovirus is highly contagious and can be transmitted through contact with an infected person or contaminated surfaces and objects. It is known to spread rapidly in closed environments such as hospitals, schools and nursing homes.Symptoms include sudden vomiting, diarrhoea or both, a temperature, headache and stomach cramps. The bug usually goes away within a few days. Although people can suffer from norovirus at any time of the year, activity increases in the winter months, with most cases seen between October and April.","Cruiseliner Azura brings passengers back from trip with vomiting bug .

"By . James Tozer . PUBLISHED: . 20:55 EST, 5 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:46 EST, 6 December 2012 . A hospital was yesterday accused of secretly placing a  68-year-old musician on the Liverpool Care Pathway after launching a court battle against his family. David James was admitted to hospital with constipation last May but contracted pneumonia and had to be transferred to intensive care. The married grandfather has remained there since, suffering severe infections, the near failure of his kidneys, a stroke and a heart attack. Plea: Relatives of grandfather David James, pictured at Easter this year, are in a legal battle with a hospital trust that wants to withdraw his treatment . Yesterday the trust launched a rare legal bid to withdraw ‘aggressive’ treatment of Mr James, arguing the pain and distress it caused him were out of proportion to his tiny chances of recovery. But his wife and children challenged the application, saying they were able to communicate with him by lip-reading and blaming his deterioration on being placed on the controversial pathway, something the hospital – which cannot be named for legal reasons – denies. Daughter Julie James, 48, told the Court of Protection: ‘I’ve always believed that from about when Dad was ventilated, he was put on the Liverpool Care Pathway. I believe he’s been put on and taken off, put on and taken off. I do believe the pathway hasn’t worked, that’s why he keeps bouncing back.’ She said she could lip-read her father asking ‘Why aren’t you in work?’ when she visited him in the morning, and suggested the hospital was taking action because he had been on the unit for so long. Miss James added: ‘There’s never been a diagnosis made – Dad has been seven months on the critical care unit. I just think he’s been there too long.’ She accused doctors of worsening his condition by refusing to give him fluids, adding: ‘We’ve never seen him in pain, we’ve never seen him grimace.’ Family: Mr James' wife May, left, and their daughter Julie, right, insist the 68-year-old musician - who is unable to speak following a tracheotomy - would want to persevere with treatment . Mr James, a well-known guitarist  who played on the 1974 hit Who Do You Think You Are? by Candlewick Green, overcame bowel cancer ten years ago. In May he was admitted to the hospital and initially seemed to be doing well. However later that month he became critically ill after contracting pneumonia and was transferred to intensive care. Doctors warned his family he was unlikely to survive, but despite suffering multiple organ failure and needing constant monitoring for low blood pressure, he is still in the hospital’s critical care unit. He cannot speak after having a tracheotomy and the trust does not accept he is capable of expressing his wishes in any other way. 'We've never seen him in pain, we've never seen him grimace' David James' daughter Julie . Yesterday the trust went to court seeking permission to stop giving Mr James medication to raise his blood pressure, dialysis for his kidneys or cardiopulmonary resuscitation if he suffers a heart attack. The court heard that if the judge agrees, Mr James will suffer further infections, slip into a coma and die. An independent intensive care consultant who has examined Mr James for the Official Solicitor – who is acting on his behalf – has backed the hospital’s argument that he is in distress and has no realistic prospect of recovery. But in emotional evidence his family yesterday told the court they did not believe the doctors and insisted he smiled when they visited and enjoyed reading the newspaper, listening to music and seeing his grandchildren. Mr James’s wife May, 67, who celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary at his bedside in September, said he sat up and read a newspaper just this week. She said when he was diagnosed with bowel cancer, his attitude was: ‘This isn’t going to beat me.’ Asked what he would say to doctors who wanted to withdraw treatment now, she said: ‘He would feel exactly the same.’ Earlier the court heard from a consultant treating Mr James, who can be referred to only as Dr G, who said: ‘I can unequivocally state we’ve never used or considered using the Liverpool Care Pathway in Mr James’s case.’ Independent doctor Christopher Danbury examined Mr James and confirmed that he was only minimally conscious. He said his chances of recovery were less than 1 per cent. The case continues.","David James, 68, has suffered a host of health problems including pneumonia, a stroke, and a heart attack .

Kiff, who admitted 19 counts of fraud last month, was jailed yesterday for 16 months after Judge Ian Pringle told her that she carried out a 'shocking' breach of trust. Wendy Hewitt, prosecuting, said Kiff had worked as Miss Baker’s sole support . worker for many years and had been employed by Mencap since 1998 when . the charity took over the company she worked for. 'The course of offending involved the use of debit cards to make transactions, to make withdrawals and in count one posing as Miss Baker to obtain a loan for £5,000,' she said. Ms Hewitt said that Kiff had been using Miss Baker’s debit cards from as far back as April 2007, until March 2011 when she ceased working with her after taking indefinite leave, and later sick leave. Between December 2009 and March 2011 she made 14 cash withdrawals, taking money from banks in and around Banbury, Oxfordshire, as well as two failed attempts to extract £50 while in Weymouth, Dorset. She also used the same card to buy goods from a jewellers, a petrol station and from a branch of clothing store Monsoon. The fraud came to light when her stand-in noticed that Miss Baker’s bank account was overdrawn by £150 and Miss Baker did not know why. Jailed: Denise Kiff, 40, was sent to prison for 16 months after admitting stealing more than £31,000 from the vulnerable woman she was supposed to be caring for . 'Denise Kiff was employed as Miss Baker’s sole support worker, responsible in every respect for not only her money but her cooking, cleaning and hygiene,' said Ms Hewitt. 'It has to fall within a severe breach of trust given her advanced years and her mental age. 'Denise Kiff had been employed for many years to care for her and this happened in Miss Baker’s own home.' Jane Brady, defending, said that Kiff had taken the money because she was in financial difficulty, and had wanted to help her recently widowed father. She told the course that Kiff and Miss Baker had been extremely close, and that Kiff regretted her actions. 'She took money from Miss Baker with a desire to improve other people’s lives not her own,' said Miss Brady. 'She accepts that spiralled out of control.' Miss Brady told the court that Kiff, of St Leonard’s Close, Banbury, was suffering from a degenerative spinal condition, which meant that she could only walk with the help of crutches. She also suffered from type two diabetes, asthma and mental health problems, and has to take nine different medications daily. The court was told that Kiff had no previous convictions save for a police caution after a football was kicked over her fence and she refused to return it. Judge Pringle told brunette Kiff, who wore a pair of sunglasses on top of her head and an anorak as she stood in the dock that he had no option but to sentence her to immediate imprisonment. 'You feel deep and genuine remorse for what you did but I would be failing in my duty if I were not to send you straight to prison,' he said. 'That is what I’m going to do. What you did over a period of nearly four years to this lady, Maureen Baker, will shock almost everybody. 'Of all the people who needed help and protection she was one of them and that’s why you were there, to assist. 'Your position was one of trust, it’s difficult to put someone in a greater amount of trust and you breached it regularly - you broke it 19 times on this indictment - and you took more than £31,000 from that lady’s bank account.' Judge Pringle sentenced her to 16 months in prison which was reduced because of her early guilty plea and medical conditions.","Denise Kiff, 40, used Maureen baker's debit card over four years .

He loved nothing more than a sing-along during his long showbusiness career. So as Max Bygraves lay dying with Alzheimer’s, it was  natural he should hark back to his musical roots.

And . to raise money for the Alzheimer’s Society, he is re-releasing his . father’s 1998 track Mary’s Boy Child as a Christmas single. The married father of three, who . lives in Bournemouth, said: ‘Dad loved singing along to his old songs in . the last few years of his life. Right until he died, he could remember . every song he’d ever done – every refrain, every verse, chorus, where . the change of key came. ‘He’d . recorded over 2,000 songs. He could remember them all, but he couldn’t . remember where the bathroom was. Remembering words and tunes is one of . the last parts of the memory to go.’ Anthony Bygraves now works as a volunteer for the Alzheimer’s Society’s Singing for the Brain service. More than 200 groups of Alzheimer’s sufferers around Britain gather for weekly sing-alongs, helping them socialise and express themselves in supportive groups. He said: ‘I help out in a group of 30 people. I just take some of my Dad’s albums down and we all sing along to them together. Lots of people know his old songs off by heart. ‘Singing them really helps people feel better for a bit.’ Incredible: Speaking for the first time about his father's death, Anthony Bygraves, pictured here with his father, said the disease that ravaged his brain left his ability to recall lyrics unharmed .

Innocent clubbers were caught up in a terrifying city centre clash between gangs as rival members tried to run each other over following a long-running dispute, a court heard. The dispute between Nathan Wood and Mark Crouth came to the boil as hundreds of partygoers poured out of Liquid nightclub in Newcastle-upon-Tyne at 3.30am on a day in April last year. Wood, 20, of Seghill, Northumberland, and Crouth, 18, of Cramlington, Northumberland, had a hatred of each other and trouble flared when they met, Newcastle Crown Court heard on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: Mark Crouth, 18, of Cramlington, Northumberland, was pictured with a golf club as partygoers poured out of Liquid nightclub in Newcastle at 3.30am on an early morning in April last year . Initial confrontation: Hundreds of innocent clubbers were caught up in the terrifying city centre clash last year . Wood began kicking a car in which Crouth was being driven by a man called David Langlands, who reversed it towards Wood and knocked down someone who was not involved in the disturbance. That person escaped without suffering serious injuries, but the car then drove a short distance up the road, stopped and Crouth got out carrying a golf club. As he marched towards a car being driven by Wood, Wood aimed his car at Crouth. Crouth managed to jump out of the way of Wood's car and started smashing its windows with the golf club. ‘Wood reverses up the street towards Crouth, who strikes the windscreen with the golf club,’ Gavin Doig, prosecuting, said. ‘Wood brings the vehicle to a stop and then drives towards Crouth.’ Violence: Wood is pictured kicking the car with Crouth inside as trouble flared when they met in Newcastle . Wood pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and affray. He was given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and was banned from driving for 12 months. 'It was a serious incident and people could have been badly injured by what took place' Judge James Goss QC . Crouth pleaded guilty to affray and was given 16 weeks suspended for 12 months. Langlands, 24, of Cramlington, was convicted of careless driving but cleared of dangerous driving and affray.  He was fined £300 and was given seven penalty points on his licence. Two members of Wood's group, Jamie Douglas, 22, of Choppington, Northumberland, and Sandy Burns, 20, of Cramlington, also pleaded guilty to affray but were said to be on the periphery of the incident. Dangerous: Wood is pictured reversing his car towards Crouth. Crouth managed to jump out of the way of Wood's car and started smashing its windows with the golf club . Douglas was given a community order with 100 hours of unpaid work while Burns was given a conditional discharge and must pay £50 costs. John Wilkinson, for Wood, said there had been trouble between him and Crouth in the past and he had given witness statements to the police about other incidents. Robert Adams, for Crouth, said: ‘He was 17 at the time and it was a long-standing dispute between him and Wood which had been going on for three years.’ Robin Denny, for Langlands, said he was a painter and decorator and that trouble had come to him. Sentence: Wood pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and affray. He was given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and was banned from driving for 12 months. Crouth is pictured left .

The ex-boyfriend of Amy Winehouse has told a court today he was optimistic of having a relationship with a woman he is accused of raping twice. Reg Traviss, 35, denies two counts of rape and told Southwark Crown Court: 'There is no truth in this allegation whatsoever.' The 27-year-old woman said earlier she woke twice in the early hours of New Year's Eve 2011 to find Traviss raping her. Reg Traviss, pictured with Any Winehouse in 2010, said he did not go out often following the singer's death in July 2011 . However the filmmaker said the pair had consensual sex at his flat after getting merrily drunk together at three bars in central London. Today he told the jury of six men and six women he had not been out for several months 'whatsoever' after Amy Winehouse died. He says he was seduced by the woman who invited him to bed. The film director, who was going out with the Back to Black star when she died in July 2011, said the following morning he and the alleged victim kissed as he walked her half way to the Tube and even made further plans to see each other. Asked by his QC Ian Winter if he thought he and the woman could have a relationship, he said: 'I sort of came away from that evening thinking this could be really good, this could be the start of something. 'I wasn’t looking for a girlfriend but she is somebody I have known for a long time and that there could be something in this.' When he did not hear back from her weeks later, after she had gone to meet a man in New York, he said: 'I thought it’s a pity and that she had got together with somebody else or just blown me out, it’s a pity. 'I thought we would meet up again and be friends after a certain time had elapsed and just go back to being friends.' Traviss, appearing in the witness box in his trademark black collared jacket and slick-backed hair, said he was shocked when the police got in touch in April with a sex allegation against him. He was not initially told who had made the complaint and said he thought it might have been a stalker inventing an allegation. Traviss, pictured arriving at court this week, left, and viewing flowers outside Amy Winehouse's home, right, said he was 'flabbergasted' by the rape accusations . Reg Traviss said he thought the evening with the alleged victim could have led to a relationship . Traviss said he was ‘completely and utterly flabbergasted’ by the allegations and believed he and his alleged victim had shared a ‘great night’. Traviss told the court he and the woman had protected, consensual sex twice at his flat. He said on the first occasion the woman had asked him to get in bed with her after he had offered to sleep on the sofa. He said she was someone he knew and trusted the woman and she instigated sex on both occasions. He added: ‘She was leading it just as much as I was going along with it. It was completely equal. ‘She was completely together mentally, compos mentis, she was completely together. She was wide awake.’ Traviss told the court they had stopped having sex after the woman said they should stop. They then chatted in the living room before she led him back to bed, he said. He told jurors that when they finished she had wanted to carry on but, after some time, he had told her ‘I’m tired. I need to go to sleep’. Prosecutor Katherine Lumsdon told jurors the woman had been ‘very drunk’ and had been ‘propping herself up’ in the last of three bars she had gone to with Traviss on December 30, 2011. But Traviss said today that she was not as drunk as she claimed to be and had held open a 11ft high glass door for him when the left the final bar at around 3.30am. The trial continues.

Plans to convert the former Bishop's Palace into a fee-paying faith school have been given the go-ahead. The BAHR Academy will cater for up to 340 boys and girls between 11 and 16 in Benwell, Newcastle. The site has been on the market since 2007, a year after the BBC stopped filming the series. Transformation: The building, pictured behind members of the Byker Grove cast, including Ant and Dec, will become an Islamic Academy . Plans include the development of the run-down site and will include a community building, coffee shop and events space that will be open at weekends. BAHR Academy principal Mufti Muhammad Abdulmuheet welcomed the decision by Newcastle City Council, which he said will see a derelict building put back into the community. He said: 'When it was run by the BBC, the site was not open to everyone but we want the public to come along, the community facilities are for everyone to use. 'We want to show that Islam is inclusive and we want to be a part of Benwell and Scotswood. 'At the moment the building is in a dire state but the community has raised funds to bring it back into use.' Write caption here .

Nurse Jacintha Saldanha, 46, unwittingly transferred their call to a colleague who gave the DJs detailed information on the Duchess's health. Ms Saldanha was found hanged days later - leading to worldwide condemnation of the DJs' prank. In hiding: Sydney-based 2DayFM radio presenters Michael Christian (left) and Mel Greig (right) have gone into hiding following the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha .

At least eight other senior staff . members at the 2Day FM radio station and its parent company, .

What has added to the fears, in the . wake of a week of hate messages on social media, is a letter sent from . South Australia and addressed to DJ Michael Christian warning him that . there was a bullet with his name on it. It is understood the letter, accompanied by a torrent of foul language, also mentioned a shotgun. Australian police, who are liaising . with Scotland Yard as a probe continues into the hoax call, are keeping in close . contact with radio station executives as a wave of fear runs through the . radio network. Police are continuing to scour social . media for any sign of further threats – and are watching for fake . messages on sites that pretend to be sourced from the radio station or . its staff. One disrespectful message regarding . Miss Saldanha and purporting to have been written by SCAustereo chief . executive officer Rhyss Holleran was dismissed by a company spokeswoman . yesterday as ‘a total fabrication.’ Sam Kaye told the Mail: ‘This is . clearly a fake, following on from other fake messages that have been . written by people out to hurt us.

Sydney’s Daily Telegraph today published photos of 10 staff members who were directly, or indirectly, behind the prank call. As well as the two DJs and Mr Holleran, they include the executive producer of the prank show, Hot30, Emily Mills and Guy Dobson, SCAustreo's head of content. Together: Ms Jacintha's husband Barboza (centre) and her children Lisha and Junal (pictured here with Labour MP Keith Vaz (right), had no idea the nurse had received the hoax phone call . The body of Jacintha Saldanha, 46, was discovered in her room in staff quarters last Friday. Two notes were found nearby and a third was among her possessions. The mother of two had also sent a . number of emails and made telephone calls that police believe might help . explain what happened. During a five-minute hearing at . Westminster Coroner’s Court earlier this week it was revealed that attempts were . made to revive the nurse but they were ‘to no avail’.

Saldanha, a night sister, was the senior nurse on duty when she took a . call at 5.30am on Tuesday from Australian DJs Mel Greig and Michael . Christian, who were pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles. She . unwittingly transferred the call to a colleague, who described in . detail the condition of Kate, who was being treated for severe morning . sickness.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 02:25 EST, 12 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:55 EST, 12 December 2012 . Two Alabama men who federal investigators say wanted to wage violent jihad overseas have been arrested in Georgia on terrorism charges, and one has close ties to another man previously identified as an Islamic terror leader, authorities said Tuesday. Mohammad Abdul Rahman Abukhdair and Randy 'Rasheed' Wilson, both 25 and from Mobile, were named in terrorism charges filed Monday, according to Kenyen R. Brown, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama. Prosecutors said Abukhdair was arrested at a bus terminal in Augusta, Ga., and Wilson was stopped in Atlanta while attempting to board a flight for the first leg of a trip to Morocco. Most-wanted: One of the men arrested is a former room-mate of Omar Shafik Hammami. Hammami is a 28-year-old American from Alabama who traveled to Somalia and became a prominent rebel spokesman. He was recently added to the FBI's most-wanted list . A sworn statement from an FBI agent . said Wilson is a close friend and former roommate of Alabama native Omar . Hammami, who was recently added to the list of the FBI's most-wanted . terror suspects. 'The law enforcement actions of today . should send a clear warning to those who would consider engaging in . violent jihad, either at home or abroad, that their future is bleak: . they may end up in a U.S. prison cell or a casualty on a foreign . battlefield,' Brown said in a statement. Court records did not indicate whether Abukhdair or Wilson has an attorney. Abukhdair was among a group of people . arrested in Egypt in 2010, on suspicion of being involved with a terror . group there, according to the sworn document, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Mobile. He was held for two months in Egypt before being deported to the United States, the statement said. Abukhdair is a native of Syracuse, . N.Y., and had lived in South Carolina and Ohio before moving to south . Alabama in October 2011, court documents said. Authorities say the men met online in 2010 while Wilson was in Alabama and Abukhdair was in Egypt. Later, Wilson allegedly told an . undercover FBI employee that he and the other man planned to travel . overseas to participate in violent jihad. Agents tracked the men's plans through an informant and the undercover FBI employee, according to the complaint. Wilson and Abukhdair planned to travel to Casablanca, Morocco, before going to Mauritania or another Muslim country to fight. The agent's statement said Abukhdair once mentioned the possibility of a terrorist kidnapping, a bombing or a shootout with police inside the United States since he feared not being able to leave the country, but Wilson didn't like the idea. U.S. attorney Kenyen R. Brown said the arrests should send a 'clear warning' to Americans who are considering engaging in jihad . Believing the FBI was on to their plans to wage jihad overseas and hoping to divert agents, Abukhdair and Wilson used $3,900 from a vehicle sale and more money from their father and stepfather to open a men's fragrance store in March, but it went out of business by July, the complaint said. The document didn't say where the store was located. A mutual friend of Hammami and Wilson began helping investigators after being denied boarding on an international flight in June, said the complaint. Both men are charged with conspiring to provide material support to terrorists with plans to kill people outside the United States. Abukhdair also is charged with passport fraud, accused of lying to obtain a new one since his old one contained immigration stamps from Egypt. Hammami, the son of a Christian mother and an Islamic father, grew up near Mobile and attended college at the University of South Alabama, where he was president of the Muslim student association.

Mark Carney, the new Bank of England governor, said it might be necessary to abandon the inflation target to prioritise growth . The Canadian who will take over the Bank of England has suggested he will be more aggressive in trying to get the British economy moving. Mark Carney hinted that he thought boosting growth is more important than keeping inflation under control. Instead central banks must take more radical measures to encourage business to expand and bring down unemployment. The move would be welcomed by mortgage owners who would expect record low interest rates to last for a long time. The Bank of England currently has a target that inflation – the annual rise in prices - should be 2 per cent. Mr Carney, who replaces Sir Mervyn King next June, used a speech to suggest central banks should instead target keeping interest rates low to reduce jobless figures. He said ‘precise numerical thresholds’ for unemployment could be used as a target instead. ‘If yet further stimulus were required, the policy framework itself would likely have to be changed,’ said Mr Carney, who is currently governor of the Bank of Canada. He later stressed that he was talking about Canadian policy, but the remarks will be seen as a sign that he will take a tougher approach when he moves to Threadneedle Street next year. Chancellor George Osborne hailed Mr Carney as 'the outstanding central banker of his generation' The UK economy has been stagnant for two years, with forecasts suggesting it will shrink by 0.1 per cent this year and grow by only 0.8 per cent next year. After being given the job by George Osborne, Mr Carney said he was going ‘where the challenges are greatest’. Mr Osborne hailed Mr Carney as 'the outstanding central banker of his generation' who would bring the 'strong leadership and external experience the Bank needs'. In a speech last night to the Chartered Financial . Analyst Society in Toronto, Mr Carney said central banks had to take . togher action during major economic slumps. He . said: ‘To achieve a better path for the economy over time, a central . bank may need to commit credibly to maintaining highly accommodative . policy even after the economy and, potentially, inflation picks up. ‘To . “tie its hands”, a central bank could publicly announce precise . numerical thresholds for inflation and unemployment that must be met . before reducing stimulus. Sir Mervyn King will stand down as Bank of England governor next June . ‘If yet further stimulus were required, the policy framework itself would likely have to be changed. For example, adopting a nominal GDP level target could in many respects be more powerful than employing thresholds under flexible inflation targeting.” It would mark a major shift from the policy of Sir Mervyn who has refused to drop the inflation target of two per cent which was set by the Labour government in 1997.","Canadian Mark Carney suggests inflation target could be ditched to focus on unemployment .

A Victoria Cross awarded to a war hero who was so badly wounded that his wife was wrongly told he was dead has sold for an impressive £192,000 - but the tale of valour behind the medal is priceless. Sergeant William Traynor was awarded the VC in 1901 for jumping from his trench into heavy enemy fire in order to dash across a battlefield to help a wounded man. He was shot in the leg and chest but still dragged the casualty to safety with the help of another comrade. Reward for valour: Sgt William Traynor's Victoria Cross (pictured left) was sold for £192,000. The brave soldier is pictured left wearing his honour after he received it in 1901 . Sheer horror: An artist's impression of the Boer war - horses were set free and men killed in their beds as the Boers launched a 3am ambush . His own injuries appeared so bad that military officials sent a telegram home to his wife saying he had been killed. She later learned that he had . survived and he went on to recover from his wounds suffered in the Boer . War at Bothwell Camp, South Africa. The grandson of Sergeant William Traynor . decided to sell the prestigious medal in order to split the proceeds . between his own children. It was bought by a British private collector for £160,000. With all the fees added on the overall price paid for it was £192,000. Christopher Hill, from auctioneers . Dix Noonan and Webb, said: ‘One of the great-grandchildren was at the . sale and was quite emotional. ‘The seller found himself in the . position of being unable to leave the medal to any one child and so . decided the best thing would be to let it go to a good home and let all . four children benefit from it. ‘We were very happy with the price the medal achieves, it was well above the pre-sale estimate.’ He added: ‘As is oft forgotten, the Victoria Cross is as much issued for saving life as it is for taking it. ‘And the gallantry displayed by William Traynor at Bothwell was a classic example of the former. Respect: He couldn't collect his Victoria Cross from King Edward VII, but Sergeant William Traynor had the chance to meet Winston Churchill - who also fought in the Boer conflict - at Sevenoaks in 1945 . ‘He rescued a wounded comrade under a murderous fire at night, himself taking hits in the chest and a thigh. ‘Indeed such was the serious nature . of his resultant wounds that his wife Jane received an erroneous War . Office telegram reporting that he had been killed in action. ‘His case has all the drama one might expect of a VC action.’ Some 2,000 enemy Boer soldiers attacked the British camp at Bothwell at 3am on February 6, 1901. They let loose horses run through the camp in order to disorientate the . British and make them think they were being attacked by the cavalry. Many . were killed in their beds before they had even dressed to respond to . the attack. Twenty-four officers were killed and 53 were badly wounded. Decorated for bravery: Sergeant William Traynor was awarded the Viictoria Cross (first left) after he left the safety of the trenches under heavy enemy fire and dashed across a battlefield to help a wounded man . Sgt . Traynor's valiant actions were true to Arthur Conan Doyle's description . of the regiment in his history of the Boer war - 'The West Yorkshires . were no more flurried at three in the morning than at three in the . afternoon.' But the . injuries he suffered in the daring rescue were so extensive that . military doctors expected him to die. Although Sgt Traynor went on to recover and reunite with his . wife, his injuries . led to him being discharged from the army. He was also unable to travel to . Buckingham Palace to receive his VC from King Edward VII. He was . invested with it at York by Colonel Edward Browne, also a VC winner from . the Boer War. Sgt Traynor later moved to Dover, . Kent, where he was given the post of barrack warden and was mentioned . for valuable service during the the First World War. He retired in 1935 but remained active in the Royal British Legion until his death in 1953 aged 83.

"Brown’s alleged mistreatment was not Delta’s first bungle involving military personnel . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:50 EST, 14 December 2012 . | .

Corporal Christian Brown, of Atlanta, Georgia, was ‘clumsily wheeled to the back row of the plane’ on Sunday, according to a complaint sent to the airline by another outraged passenger and military service member. Efforts by several fellow military veterans to move Brown from a coach seat to a first class seat offered up by another flyer were rebuffed by the crew, Army Colonel Nickey Knighton wrote in a detailed customer care report to Delta. Mistreated hero: Corporal Christian Brown, of Atlanta, Georgia, was was reportedly 'humiliated to the point of tears' by Delta Air Line staff during a flight to Washington D.C. The Delta flight attendants insisted no one could move through the cabin because the doors were being closed for lift-off, Knighton wrote. Knighton, a former helicopter pilot with nearly 30 years of service, said she had assumed that because Brown boarded last, he would be seated up front for comfort and ease of exit in case of emergency. Instead Brown was squeezed into a narrow aviation wheelchair that ‘bumped up against stationary aisle seats as he was wheeled through the aircraft,’ Knighton wrote in her complaint. ‘[He] was obviously humiliated by being paraded through the aircraft and was visibly upset. I touched Brown on his shoulders and asked if he was okay. Tears ran down his face, but he did not cry out loud.’ Brown was flying back to Washington with a military ‘escort buddy,’ according to The Washington Post. He was also reportedly sick during the flight. Brown’s mother told the Washington . Post that had she been with her son, ‘it would have turned out a little . bit differently. I just can’t imagine what it was like for him, being . that sick. He had a 104-degree fever and he was shaking.’ Furious complaint: Brown, of Atlanta, Georgia, was 'clumsily wheeled to the back row of the plane' on Sunday, according to a complaint sent to the airline . Loss of limbs: Brown was leading his squad on a foot patrol in Afghanistan's Helmand province when he stepped on an explosive device that blew off both his legs, one above the knee, the other below his hip .

He was leading his squad on a foot in the country’s Helmand province when he stepped on an explosive device that blew off both his legs, one above the knee, the other below his hip. He also lost part of his right index finger. Brown’s alleged mistreatment was not Delta’s first bungle involving military personnel. The Atlanta-based airline became the target of a national outrage in June 2011, when two soldiers posted a YouTube video about their experience catching a connecting flight from Baltimore to Atlanta after an 18-hour layover from Afghanistan. Several in the group of more than 30 service members were charged $200 each to check a fourth bag. Rough flight: The double amputee had also reportedly become sick during his Delta flight . 'Hell no': Brown said he will never fly Delta again . Following a wave public and Congressional criticism in response to that video, Delta announced it would allow military personnel and dependents to check extra bags for free. In Brown’s case, the solution may be comprehensive sensitivity training for crew members, writes ABC News. Brown’s ‘story in no way reflects either Delta’s standard operating procedure or the very high regard we hold for our nation’s service members,’ Delta spokesman Michael Thomas said in an email statement responding to Knighton’s complaint letter. ‘We are sorry for the difficulties that transpired and are investigating this event to determine the appropriate next steps.’ After Delta handles the allegations and appropriate next steps, will Brown fly the airline again? ‘Hell, no,’ he told the Washington Post.

But now it appears that the tide has turned for the rare creatures and thanks to a successful breeding programme there are more than 1,000 on the islands. The tortoises which helped inspire Charles Darwin's theories of evolution were virtually extinct - but thanks to pioneering work the future looks much less bleak. Road to recovery: A young tortoise at the Fausto Llerena Breeding Centre in Galapagos National Park where a successful breeding programme has seen numbers rise to more than 1,000 . There are now thought to be more than 1,000 tortoises on the islands of Santa Cruz, Santiago, Pinzen, and Espanola. Conservationists began a unique project to return the environment back to the time when Darwin first visited the Galapagos in the mid 19th Century. The group of rocky, volcanic islands 600 miles west of mainland Ecuador are a Unesco world natural heritage site and home to dozens of species found nowhere else. Some 95 per cent of the territory's 3,000 sq miles is a protected area. Endangered: The giant tortoise, seen here feeding on a prickly pear, was almost wiped out after the arrival of humans to the Galapagos islands . Success: Conservationists say there are now more than 1,000 giant tortoises on the Galapagos islands following a successful breeding and repatriation programme . Charles Darwin visited the Galapagos islands during his five-year voyage around South America which set sail in 1831. He was fascinated by the giant tortoise and in particular noted the difference in the shape of their shells between the different species on each island. It helped him understand how animals adapt to their environment and inspire his theories of evolution which shook the scientific world when they were published in 1859. Inspiring: Tortoise eggs in an incubation pod as part of the successful breeding programme which has helped save the iconic giant tortoise from extinction . Theory: Charles Darwin became fascinated by the giant tortoise and noted the difference between the shells of different species. This helped him understand how animals adapt to their environment . But the iconic species was all but wiped out by the actions of the human population throughout the 20th century. After running out of tortoises to eat, sailors introduced goats to the island and their numbers multiplied rapidly, destroying the island's vegetation. The remaining tortoises had to be taken into a captive breeding environment while the goat population was culled. But there is renewed hope that the giant tortiose will flourish now that tortoise numbers have risen and the species appears to have become part of the ecosystem once again.","Pioneering breeding programme has saved the iconic species .

One in ten families are millionaires if they include assets such as their homes and their pension pots, official figures revealed yesterday. The figures, from the Office for National Statistics, show the huge wealth of the top 10 per cent in this country at a time when millions are struggling to get by. They also reveal the extent of the North-South divide, with the highest concentration of millionaire households in the Home Counties. This graphic, showing the distribution of the wealthiest households in Britain, reveals that the highest concentration of millionaire households is in the Home Counties . The ONS said the rich 10 per cent, equal to around 2.5million families, each have assets which are ‘greater than £967,000’. In fact, the average wealth among this group is £1.3million – meaning that the wealthiest of all are worth many millions more than this. Meanwhile, one in every two families in Britain have almost nothing, with few assets and little chance of a comfortable retirement as a result. At the very bottom, there are 10 per cent of families with total assets of less than £13,000. The study, called the Wealth and Assets survey, is one of the largest investigations into the nation’s wealth. It was based on the assets of 20,170 households and carried out between 2008 and 2010. Householders were asked about the value of their home, minus the value of any mortgage. Second homes, such as a country cottage in the Cotswolds, a buy-to-let investment or a holiday home in another country, were included. On average, the richest 10 per cent of households have pension wealth of £742,000, property wealth of £340,000, physical wealth of £68,000 and net financial wealth of £123,200 . Their pension pot is also taken into account, as well as their ‘net financial wealth’ – their savings and investments –  excluding any debts. Finally, their ‘physical wealth’, which is the value of the contents of their home – or homes – was estimated. In total, the ONS said the net wealth of all private households in Britain is £10.3trillion. The rich 10 per cent have assets worth a total £4.5trillion, nearly 45 per cent of the total. On average, these households have pension wealth of £742,000, property wealth of £340,000, physical wealth of £68,000 and net financial wealth of £123,200. The bottom 50 per cent have an average pension pot of £4,000, savings and investments of £400 and no property wealth at all, according to the ONS. However, 2.5 per cent of households in this group have still splashed out on a personalised numberplate. The study, called the Wealth and Assets survey, asked householders about the value of their home, minus the value of any mortgage . The study showed that a typical family has total household wealth of £232,000 – although many of them feel far from wealthy and regularly face a struggle to make ends meet. While they have significant assets, much of it is tied up in something which they cannot actually use to pay for the weekly food shop or their rising energy bill, such as their pension pot or their home. The ONS said there was a huge regional variations in the number of millionaire households. The South East is the biggest winner, with 15.5 per cent – or more than one in six – of households in the richest 10 per cent, compared to only 6.9 per cent in Scotland and 7.6 per cent in the North East and North West. The research shows the effect of the house price boom. Many of the millionaire households bought their properties decades ago and have seen their value soar. There are 668,500 households between the age of 45 and 54 and 929,600 households between the age of 55 and 64 who are in the richest top 10 per cent of Britons. Because they are nearing retirement, they often have very large pension pots. This group are also three times more likely to hold a degree or an even higher academic qualification than those in the least wealthy half of households. A spokesman for StepChange, the debt charity, said: ‘The wealth of the top 10 per cent stands in marked contrast to the dire financial situation many households in Britain find themselves in today.’","Most millionaire households are in the Home Counties .

Beaten up: Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer has allegedly been assaulted by an 18-year-old in Kentucky . A US marine who received the nation's highest military award for valour is recovering after being attacked by a teenager. Sgt Dakota Meyer, who received Medal of Honor from President Barack Obama last year, has been recovering after allegedly being attacked in Kentucky. Police have arrested 18-year-old Kanissa'a Thompson, who has been charged with second-degree assault, in connection with the incident. Former marine Sgt Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor last September, two years after the young corporal saved 36 lives during a six-hour ambush in Afghanistan. He is the third living recipient of the award for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan. Fox News has reported how he was injured in the fight which took place early Sunday at the Red Barn Event Rental, near Colombia, Kentucky, which is used to host events including wedding receptions and class reunions. He is reported to have told the news channel that he was hit over the head with a bottle and then kicked and beaten while on the ground by a group of up to ten or more people before he woke up in hospital with three staples in his head. According to reports, Sgt Meyer was injured badly enough to be treated at a local hospital. A State Police spokesman was also reported as saying the severity of the charge indicates he was seriously injured, a State Police spokesman told the Herald-Leader. During the 2009 firefight a 21-year-old Sgt Meyer defied orders from his commanders by charging five times in a Humvee into heavy gunfire and provided cover for his team, allowing many to escape likely death. He killed at least eight Taliban insurgents. After the medal was approved, President Barack Obama waited to call until Sgt Meyer's lunch break because the then 23-year-old worried about taking a call on the job. He also made headlines last year when he tried to sue a defense contractor that he said ridiculed his Medal of Honor, called him mentally unstable and suggested he had a drinking problem, thereby costing him a job.

In a defamation lawsuit filed in Texas, Sgt Meyer alleged that his former employer, BAE Systems OASYS Inc. ruined his chances at landing a new job by telling a prospective employer that he was a poor worker during a three-month stint this past spring. Leaving active duty in May of 2010, Sgt Meyer was hired by BAE in March the following year after working for another defense contractor named Ausgar Technologies that hired veterans to train active-duty service members, according to the Wall Street Journal. BAE's manager had claimed Sgt Meyer in that time 'was mentally unstable, that Sgt.

He has already been jailed for his anti-social behaviour and last year was forced to wear an electronic tag to ensure he kept the peace. But that didn’t stop 86-year-old John Bushell launching yet another torrent of abuse at his long-suffering neighbours. The retired book-keeper was sweeping his drive when he accused Kenneth and Marjorie Mills of living in a ‘midden’ – a 14th century word for a manure dump. Of Scandinavian origin, the term is still in use in Scotland and the North of England where it refers to anything that is a mess. Bushell also called his 66-year-old neighbours – who were filming him with a camcorder – ‘scumbags’. His actions resulted in him breaking the restraining order the couple had taken out against him. Bushell was first handed an order in 1998 which banned him from contacting the couple. Tensions have grown during the five decades they have lived next-door to each other in a cul-de-sac in Hebburn, South Tyneside. He has breached the order eight times, resulting in a further three convictions and was jailed in 2001 and tagged last year. The court at the time of the jail . sentence heard how Bushell plagued the lives of families he thought did . not keep their homes up to scratch. He has now been found guilty of breaching the order again after he hurled abuse at his neighbours on May 7. South Tyneside magistrates deferred his sentence for six months. Bushell admitted shouting at Mr and Mrs Mills, but said he had been provoked by them filming him. In his defence, he said: ‘They are plaguing my life with the camera. I was just out trying to make my place look nice. Marjorie Mills and husband Kenneth have been victims of a 40 year campaign of harassment by neighbour John Bushell, which saw him jailed in 2001 and electronically tagged last year . ‘She came out and said she had me locked up before and would  do again. ‘She said we were snobs and no one liked us and we should just leave. I called them scumbags in response to that.’ After seeing a video of the rant and . hearing from other neighbours who watched the exchange, magistrates . found he had no excuse for the insults he directed at the couple. Chairwoman of the bench Patricia Morris said: 'We believe it has been proved that you breached the order. South Tyneside magistrates watched a video of Bushell's rant and found he had no excuse . 'And we are satisfied that evidence we heard from Mr and Mrs Mills and the other neighbours was credible. 'We . do not accept you had reasonable grounds to breach the order and . therefore find the case proved beyond all reasonable doubt."" Instead . of sentencing Bushell straight away, the magistrates deferred the . sentence for six months and he will be back at the court on May 1. Mrs Morris added: 'During that time, we expect you to keep away from your neighbours.' Speaking after Bushell’s latest conviction, Mr and Mrs Mills said they wanted to call an end to their feud. The couple said they had lived  in . fear of their neighbour since moving into their home in 1970. Mrs Mills . said: ‘All we want to do is to be able to enjoy our lives in peace. 'We have been here before. 'He has been to jail and had a curfew and been warned by judges about his behaviour, but it hasn't stopped him.' The couple say they have lived in fear of their neighbour since moving into their home in Mill Crescent, Hebburn, in 1970. A 'midden' is a Middle English term deriving from the Scandinavian word 'mykdyngja' which literally translates as 'manure pile'. The term 'midden' is commonly used by . archaeologists to describe any kind of feature containing waste . products relating to day-to-day human life. The East Chisenbury midden, on Salisbury Plain, . is a famous example of a large dump.The midden mound contains numerous discrete layers of flint, charcoal, . bones, pottery and excrement. The couple have tried to sell their . £200,000 home three times, but the buyers have pulled out each time . after hearing about Bushell. Bushell also claims to have tried to sell his home but neither family have managed to move. Mrs Mill added: 'No one wants to live next to a man like him. He would have a better chance of selling the house. 'There . have been sale signs up twice but I don't think he will move really. I . don't mind him living there, as long as he keeps out of our way. 'He can sweep his yard, walk past our house and do whatever he likes - as long as it doesn't involve us. 'We don't bother him, so why should he bother us. 'He said we shouldn't film him but I only do that when he starts harassing us, mit is the only way to prove what he is like.' Bushell, . who lives with wife Sonia in the cul-de-sac, said he has listened to . the magistrates and will do his best to keep the peace. Speaking after the case, he said: 'I have got to accept the court's decision and do as they say. 'I will keep myself to myself and keep out of their way.'

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 09:19 EST, 9 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:51 EST, 10 December 2012 . Hillary Clinton is set to set up camp in a luxury Hamptons home with husband Bill and plot her moves for a widely-expected run for the Presidency in 2016. She will step down as Secretary of State after the President's inauguration in January, and aides have revealed how she will retreat to the New York seaside famous for its wealthy residents. Mrs Clinton is also set to discuss whether or not she will run for president in 2016. Mrs Clinton got an unexpected endorsement from former Republican speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who said that his party has no one that could match her if she does step up for the nomination. Weighing her options: Hillary Clinton is likely to command hefty fees on the speaker circuit after she leaves her post as Secretary of State, though it is unclear if she will run for president again in 2016 . 'If their competitor in 2016 is Hillary Clinton, supported by Bill Clinton and presumably a still relatively popular President Barack Obama, trying to win that will be the Super Bowl. And the Republican party today is incapable of competing at that level,' he said during an appearance on Meet The Press. The compliment is particularly surprising considering that Gingrich and Bill Clinton famously sparred when they were rivals in the 1990s, and Gingrich was the one to push for the investigation of the then-President's affair with intern Monica Lewinsky. 'First of all, she's very formidable as a person. She's a very competent person. She's married to the most popular Democrat in the country; they both think (it) would be good for her to be president. It makes it virtually impossible to stop her for the nomination,' he said. His prediction is backed up by numbers, as a recent Washington Post poll reports that 57 per cent of Americans would support a Hillary Clinton campaign. According to multiple reports, Mrs Clinton has echoed her denials of plans to run for office in both private and public, but that doesn't mean that she can just go ahead and truly let loose in her new-found state of unemployment. With any and all positions that she decides to take, she will have to weigh the optics of if it would look appropriate for a presidential candidate. That said, another concern is shoring up a steady income, because it doesn't come cheap to live like the Clintons. The good life: The Clintons have been frequent visitors to the Hamptons in the summer, seen here this past August, though it is now thought that they may be buying a place there . Longtime fans: President Clinton (seen here in 1999) has previously rented homes and stayed with some of their famous friends- like Kate Capshaw and Stephen Spielberg . The New York Times . reports that one of her first moves out of office would be to look into . buying a home in the Hamptons, as she and former President Bill have . frequently vacationed in the tony beach getaway. A . home befitting two of the country's biggest political heavyweights . would easily run in the multi-million dollar range, any the couple are . known to enjoy the benefits of a lifestyle that allows private jet use. Much of her hesitation in deciding about 2016 comes from the failed bid in 2008, and it comes as little surprise that those mistakes are also influencing her financial decisions. As recently as September 30 of this year, Hillary still has $73,000 remaining of her campaign debt. Politico reported that her husband sent out multiple emails to supporters in hopes of earning back some of that money to have that number decreased- if not deleted- by this month. Aides to Mrs Clinton say a continued working partnership between she and Bill is one of the likely steps after she takes some immediate time off from her taxing travel schedule following her leave of office. The Clinton Foundation, which has occupied much of the former President's time since he left the White House, is seen as an ideal place for Hillary to ease her way back into public life and find a way to work on causes closest to her. Fighting for women's rights has always been at the top of her agenda, and it is considered a given that she will be working for that cause in some form for the rest of her career. Time together: Aides think that Hillary will spend some time working with her husband's foundation as she finds her footing outside of the constraints of formal political office for the first time in decades . Who knows: She reportedly thinks that one of her biggest mistakes in her last presidential bid was announcing too early, so if she goes for it again, she likely won't say so publicly until mid-2015 . Speaking engagements and a new book about her time as Secretary of State are two other options for the ways to fill the time- and her bank accounts- but the frankness of those potential opportunities will be limited if she does eventually decide to run for president again. If her words are being seen as keys to a possible political agenda, as opposed to candid reflections on her time as the American emissary abroad, she will be forced to leave the candor for private conversations. Realistically though, such a decision will not come for some time, as she has told insiders that one of the biggest mistakes she made in her last campaign was announcing her candidacy too early, effectively making the race longer and less manageable. That time, she announced two years before the election, so if she heeds her own advice, that means that she likely will not publicly discuss the option until mid-2015. For now, however, she continues to keep all of her options open- and decidedly vague. 'I’m frankly looking forward to returning to living a life that enjoys a lot of simple pleasures and gives me time for family and friends and other pursuits,' she said during her latest trip to Ireland.","Leaving office in January and is considered a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 .

PUBLISHED: . 10:52 EST, 14 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:32 EST, 14 December 2012 . She has made quite a name for herself during her first few weeks on Made in Chelsea thanks to her man-hopping antics, explosive arguments and overused 'catchphrase' 'why is everyone getting up in my grill?'. But self-confessed 'player' Lucy Watson insists that she isn't as bad as people think and that the show portrays her in the wrong light. 'I'm not as bad as I look on TV, I promise,' she told MailOnline after co-star and former flame Jamie Laing dubbed her a 'b****'. Setting the record straight: Lucy Watson insists that she is nicer in real life than the way she is portrayed on TV . The pretty brunette who was caught in a love triangle with loveable blonde Jamie and nostril-flaring favourite Andy Jordan enraged viewers when she ditched both men to set her sights on Louise Thompson's boyfriend Spencer Matthews this week. But while some cast mates haven't warmed to 21-year-old Lucy, newcomer Stevie Johnson has nothing but nice things to say about her. 'She really is a lovely girl,' he said at fellow Made in Chelsea star turned clothes designer Ollie Proudlock's launch night on Wednesday. Handsome Sam Cussins added: 'Even though she's a good lass she could be a bit high maintenance for me. 'Lucy is more into her bad boy type which me and Stevie don't massively fit into!' Dumped: Lucy dumped Andy Jordan on Monday night's episode, leaving him to dine alone . Most of the Chelsea cast were out in force to support the launch of Proudlock's Serge DeNimes clothing label and pop-up shop at Wolf and Badger in Mayfair, but Andy Jordan was notably absent. One surprise guest was I'm a Celebrity Get Me out of Here star Hugo Taylor and his petite girlfriend Natalie Joel. The pair couldn't keep their hands off each other and whilst the rest of the cast partied in private members club Mortons until the early hours, the smitten couple retired early. Support: Hugo Taylor and girlfriend Natalie Joel as well as Jamie Laing and Spencer Matthews turned out to support Proudlock's pop-up . Dolled up: Rosie Fortescue dressed up for the occasion and wore her trademark fedora hat . 'Apart from one other clothing label, Serge DeNimes is all I wear. I even wore it in the jungle, I love the new stuff, Ollie has put so much work into it,' Hugo told MailOnline. Jamie Laing added: 'I love the clothes, my boy Ollie is repping it hard. 'I'm not wearing any because I thought it was too embarrassing to turn up wearing a T-shirt at the Serge launch; I thought that would show a bit too much keenness. 'I have most of the collection, I always steal the T-Shirts from him.' Stressed: Ollie Proudlock had a stressful day planning the event but was so happy with the turn out . The pint-sized blonde couldn't hide his excitement about moving in with best friend Spencer, even though Spencer's girlfriend Louise made it extremely clear she is unhappy about the decision in Monday's episode. Jamie said: 'I can't wait for us all to move in together. 'We are still looking for a place. I think we are going to wait until January, that's like our Christmas present to each other, moving in with each other.' Man of the evening Ollie Proudlock, who was supported by his Serge DeNimes team and his family including mother Lena who Oliver describes as his 'inspiration' and fashion muse, chatted to guests sporting a selection of pieces from his eponymous label. He said: 'I'm pretty stressed, it was one of those days when everything comes together really late but it's a great turn out, all my friends are here and I love the way the shop looks.'

"By . LOrd Heseltine . PUBLISHED: . 21:10 EST, 8 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:10 EST, 8 December 2012 . George Osborne had the guts to tell it as it is last Wednesday. We are a trading nation. Every market to which we sell has its economic problem: America has a fiscal cliff, China and India are both slowing, Europe is mired in debt. Searching for silver linings in such a cloud-laden sky as though we live in an economy divorced from the rest of the world is for the naive or the deceitful. Hard road to recovery: Lord Heseltine, a former deputy Prime Minister, is adamant there are no quick fixes to solve the country's economic problems . Recovery will be slow as consumers live within their means, banks rebuild their balance sheets and governments get a grip on public extravagance. In team Cameron-Osborne, we have one of the most determined drivers of strategic growth I have seen. This is no flash-in-the-pan gesture or packet of gimmicks. This is a Government prepared to argue for a strategy for the nation, and much more important, actually do something to implement it. Chancellor George Osborne has set his face to the wind.  Michael Gove is tackling a country of educational underperformance. Iain Duncan Smith is talking about dependency as though he understands it. Unlike Labour, they are all determined to reduce the levels of debt. For there is no serious long-term future for our economy that does not grip the scale of indebtedness. Leadership: Chancellor George Osborne showed guts by not shying away from the difficult decisions needed to set the country on the road to recovery . There is no more money, as the outgoing Labour Chief Secretary honourably admitted as Labour lost the Election. Nothing has changed – except the official Labour line that the economic law of gravity has somehow ceased to exist. Listening to Ed Balls on economic policy has all the coherence of consulting the undertaker before the doctor has called. You cannot borrow your way out of debt . – everyone in the real world knows that. So we have to get better value . from what we can afford. That is the message of my report, No Stone Unturned, which aims to reverse a century of centralisation. Mr . Osborne has endorsed its localist thrust to revive the local initiative . and drive of earlier centuries that made us what we are. Switching . money from departmental administration budgets into building schemes is . the right way to go. Taking . cash from bureaucracy and channelling it into house-building, schools . and science will create jobs now and provide long-term stability. Rather . than Ministers and civil servants in London saying to places such as . Carlisle and Crewe, ‘You can have this much for roads, this much for . housing, this much for waste’, ask those places: ‘What would you spend . it on?’ It’s truly transformational. Folly: Listening to shadow chancellor Ed Balls' economic policy of borrowing your way out of a debt crisis would be disastrous . It gives me great encouragement that Mr Osborne said on Wednesday that he agrees with that idea and will work up plans in next year’s Spending Review to achieve it. I salute such confidence. The confidence of a Government to turn to someone outside and ask for their thoughts. Not just anyone, but me. The fact is I come with baggage – I have previous, as some would say. But that baggage – my 40 years in Whitehall and my 60 years running my own business – has taught me there is another, better way of doing things. We are far too over-centralised in the UK. In the US, they have the states, in France the departments and in Germany the länder. We have no comparable system of real local power, influence and decision-making. The Chancellor also gave the green light to my suggestion that Local Enterprise Partnerships receive money to develop growth plans for their areas. Green light: Chancellor George Osborne gave the go-ahead in his Autumn Statement to Local Enterprise Partnerships, which will rejuvenate the economy in hard hit areas of the country . LEPs are led by local business people and are a partnership with local government. They have thus far relied largely on goodwill, but will now be funded by government to spend two years looking at strengths they wish to build on and weaknesses they wish to overcome. Just imagine – 39 teams right across England, beavering away  to identify how high streets and businesses can flourish. Mr Osborne announced further money for the Regional Growth Fund. To find extra cash for it at such times of economic prudence is a sign of its remarkable success. It is delivering long-lasting private sector jobs in the places that most need them. The fund is underpinned by all the things I believe in – that government should ask local people for their ideas rather than dictating to them from London; that wealth creation should be a joint venture between the private and public sectors; and that if you make the allocation of public money a competitive process, the amount of match-funding you can lever in from the private sector is staggering. Hope for growth: Under Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured during a visit to a car maker in Solihull, and Chancellor George Osborne the country has determined drivers for strategic growth . There were, of course, things the Chancellor did not say I would have liked him to, but I am heartened to hear a full response to my ideas will come in the spring. I hope that response will say more about local business support. There is little point giving more money, and influence over how it is spent, to our towns and cities if there is not an environment in which firms help each other to get ahead. If you are interested in exporting, you need to be able to speak to someone who has been doing it successfully for years. If you want to take on apprentices, you need the advice of a firm that already has dozens on its books. None of this is rocket science but it can’t happen by chance. All of our major competitors have sophisticated local business support, yet ours is too fragmented, or non-existent in places. The chamber of commerce in Milan has 350,000 businesses as members, whereas Birmingham’s has fewer than 3,000. We must do something to remedy that. We cannot make firms sign up to chambers, so why don’t we make them attractive bodies that people want to join? To that end, I suggest letting chambers deliver services that currently sit in Whitehall and its quangos. Part of the reason we have fallen behind in the global race is that too often people think growth is someone else’s problem. Whether it is Whitehall departments not seeing how they contribute to wealth creation, local authorities obsessing about social provision, or coasting businesses not doing more to increase their performance, we all can – and should – do more. Governments do not have all the answers. As a Conservative, I have never believed they could do. But only the Government can empower us to find those answers ourselves. I hope that in their full response in the spring, this Government will take the opportunity to do just that.",One of the biggest beasts in the Tory jungle savages Labour delusions over Britain’s gargantuan debt .

A baby girl who underwent open heart surgery at just 30 minutes old has been allowed home for the first time ever to celebrate Christmas. Five-month-old Jessica Muse is believed to be the youngest person ever to undergo open heart surgery after she had the procedure half an hour after birth. Jessica has spent her whole life in hospital, but today left the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle for the first time with her delighted parents Claire and Dom, so they can enjoy the festive season at home. Five-month-old Jessica Muse, pictured with parents Claire and Dom, is believed to be the youngest ever person to undergo open heart surgery, just 30 minutes after she was born . Jessica was born hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, meaning she essentially had half a heart as the left side of her heart was severely underdeveloped and did not work. The life-threatening condition was detected during Mrs Muse's 20-week scan and doctors also discovered she had an 'intact septum' meaning the top two chambers of her heart were fully closed.Without surgery, Jessica would not survive after birth. When she was born weighing 7lbs 5oz on July 16th this year by Caesarean section, Mrs Muse, 31, and husband Dom, 29, a process operator at a factory, only managed to get a quick glimpse of their daughter before she was whisked away immediately for surgery. Jessica was born hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, meaning she essentially had half a heart as the left side was severely underdeveloped and did not work . Dr Asif Hasan performed the delicate operation on Jessica, whose heart was the size of a walnut, in an open heart procedure known as an atrial septostomy. The top two chambers of her tiny heart were cut open and operation enabled her to survive long enough to have her next seven-hour long open heart procedure at ten days old. At one point, her parents, who live in Newcastle, were told their daughter's chances of survival were 'very small' and feared she might not make it. But after nine operations in total, including the two open heart surgeries, Jessica is battling back and is getting used to life at home. Mrs Muse, a computer technician at Northumbria University, said: 'After Jessica was born, I literally heard her cry and she was whisked away to be operated on. Now, after nine operations, including the two open heart surgeries, Jessica is getting used to life at home . 'I just wanted to grab hold of her and keep her safe but I knew that she urgently needed the surgery. 'We've been told she's probably the youngest ever to have open heart surgery. 'Without the staff and surgeons at the hospital, Jessica wouldn't be here today. We can't thank them enough, they are brilliant. 'It's her first Christmas and it's so special. We didn't know if she'd even be here at this point. 'We didn't know whether to buy many presents at first because we weren't sure if she'd get to come home, but Jessica has a lot of gifts now, from us and friends. 'We managed to get the Christmas tree up for her too so we're really looking forward to it. 'Looking at her now, it's hard to believe that she's been through so much and we are so grateful to the Children's Heart Unit Fund at the Freeman.' During surgery, the top two chambers of her tiny heart were cut open. This enabled her to survive long enough to have her next seven-hour long open heart procedure at ten days old . Jessica will also need a heart transplant when she is ten . Mrs Muse was unable to be by her daughter's side immediately after the birth because the Freeman does not have a maternity unit and spent an agonising night at the Royal Victoria Infirmary awaiting news about whether the operation had been a success. She said: 'It was very scary not being there with her or knowing what was going on. 'Although we knew from a very early stage in my pregnancy that Jessica would be poorly, we didn't know exactly what would be wrong with her. 'Normally babies have surgery where a balloon is inserted through the veins and it opens up the heart, but Jessica had to have open heart surgery. 'The doctors couldn't tell us what would happen because it all depended on how she reacted and if she could cope, but the surgeon let me know as soon as possible that Jessica had made it.' Following the second surgery, Jessica's sternum was left open and covered with a plastic film and it was eventually closed when she was three and a half weeks old. She also met a special visitor during her final few days at the Freeman . Hospital. Ex-Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer has recently become patron of the Children's Heart Unit Fund charity . Her mother added: 'You could see her little heart beating underneath the film which was a little scary, but she needed it to survive.' After the second operation, Jessica was also diagnosed with pulmonary lymphangiectasia, a lung condition which was caused due to her underdeveloped heart. She had her last operation, a tracheostomy, at six weeks and one day old, to help her breathe. Jessica faces two more operations - one at the end of January and another aged four to allow her heart to function properly. Eventually she will need a heart transplant, at around the age of ten. Jessica also had a special visitor during her final few days at the Freeman Hosptal, ex-Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer, who this week took on the role of patron of the Children's Heart Unit Fund charity. Mrs Muse said: 'She had her picture taken with Shearer holding her when he came to visit the hospital.'Dom says he's going to get the picture framed with a caption underneath it saying: ""One legend meets another"".'","Five-month-old Jessica Muse is believed to be the youngest person ever to undergo open heart surgery when she was just 30 minutes old .

Daniels told Fox that they even called a bomb specialist to the scene, while other passengers reportedly spoke out in support of Shelbi and offered her tissues and candy. 'There were people saying, ""Really? You're going to do this to her? Y'all have to take her somewhere private . where she's not out in the public and everyone can see her"",' Shelbi told Fox in Fort Worth. 'It was frightening. I kinda got mad.' Ordeal: Her mother said she was not allowed to get close to her crying daughter to comfort her . Bizarre: They had to wait for an hour in front of hundreds of travellers while the TSA called a bomb expert . After nearly an hour, Daniels said agents suddenly told them they were free to pass through the security checkpoint but offered no explanation for the incident. 'It's okay, you didn't do anything wrong, we're going to get you on your way,' an agent can be heard telling Shelbi in the video as she cries into her hands. The youngster and her mother made it just in time for their flight. But Shelbi said that a check of wheelchair could have revealed the TSA's mistake much earlier. 'It could have come off fertilizer, . because we have chickens,' she told WFAA. 'It could have just come off the ground, because I roll . through everything.' Enraged: Shelbi said they should have checked the wheelchair as she had probably rolled through something . Annoyed: Her mother, Tammy Daniels, said the TSA needs to reconsider how it treats children . Her mother added that she had been left outraged by the way her daughter was treated. 'I am by no means undermining our safety in the air,' she said. 'After 9/11, by no . means am I doing that. But when it comes to . children, common sense is not in a textbook.' But the TSA defended the incident in a statement. 'We are sensitive to the concerns of . passengers who were not satisfied with their screening experience and we . invite those individuals to provide feedback to TSA through a variety . of channels,' it said. 'We work to balance those concerns . with the very real threat that our adversaries will attempt to use . explosives to carry out attacks on planes.' Scene: The TSA said they try to balance considerate screenings with the threats of air travel . The video is just the latest to bring the TSA's responses into question. Last month, Representative Ralph Hall of Texas claimed his 17-year-old niece had her dress pulled down after she was taken aside to be screened at Hartsfield-Jackson Airport in Atlanta. The incident happened two years ago but came to light under the Freedom of Information Act after it was caught on surveillance camera. Hall has called for the agent to be fired. And last year, two other wheelchair users, Jason and Jennifer Steitler from Florida, claim they were forced up from their wheelchairs and groped under their girls by agents at Greater Rochester International Airport in New York.","Video shows Shelbi Walser as she is held in front of hundreds of passengers .

Trafficking of wildlife and products such as timber and rhino horn is one of the world's biggest illegal trades, worth £12 billion a year, conservationists have warned. Species such as rhinos, elephants and tigers are being poached in Africa and Asia, while antique collections, museums and even zoos in the UK are at risk from criminal gangs attempting to steal rhino horn, conservation group WWF said. Exhibits of rhino heads at Haslemere Educational Museum, Surrey, and Norwich Castle Museum have both been targeted by thieves as criminals seek to cash in on increasing demand for rhino horn as a cancer medicine or 'hangover cure' in Asia. The WWF has warned species such as rhinos are being poached in Africa and Asia, while antique collections, museums and even zoos in the UK are at risk from criminal gangs attempting to steal rhino horn . Across the world, illegal trade in wildlife including timber and unregulated and unreported fishing has become a lucrative business for criminal syndicates, with profits that can be used to finance civil conflicts and terrorism, a report for WWF found. It is also pushing some species to the brink of extinction, hitting local communities in some of the poorest parts of the world and raising the threat of spreading infectious diseases. The internet is also making it easier for criminals to trade in illegal products around the world, the research by Dalberg Global Development Advisors warned. Rhino horn is now worth more than £37,000 a kilo, fetching more on the black market than diamonds and cocaine, leading to a surge of poaching in South Africa to record highs last year. It is particularly sought after in Vietnam. Elephants are also being targeted for their ivory, with poaching across Africa at record levels in 2011. The animals are being targeted in mass poaching incidents by criminal gangs armed with military issue machine guns, and there have been reports of Sudanese militias including the Janjaweed poaching ivory for profit. Illegal ivory found by authorities in Kenya. Poaching across Africa was at record levels in 2011 . Kenya Wildlife Service warders carry tusks that were intercepted from poachers in Marsabit where they were being transported to Ethiopia and then to Egypt . A recent incident in Central Africa saw 300 elephants killed by Sudanese poachers, and WWF's wildlife trade expert Heather Sohl warned the species could face localised extinctions if poaching continued at that level. She said of the threats to animals such as elephants, rhinos and tigers: 'These are iconic species, they are being exploited and it's illegal and should be stopped.' The report warned that species with high value to illegal traders had seen dramatic declines in recent years, including forest elephants in parts of the Congo basin, Asian elephant, Sumatran rhino and Javan rhino. In the UK, auction houses saw huge prices paid for pieces from rhinos before the Government took action to prevent them being exported to Asia to meet demand for the animal's horn, and there has also been an increase in thefts. 'It's a high profit, low risk business, . the chances of them being caught in some of these countries is very low, . and if that happens there's a great deal of corruption in these . countries and they can offer a bribe and you don't see convictions.' Expert Heather Sohl . 'It's such a concern that enforcement authorities have spoken to all these antique collections, museums and even zoos to say they could be at risk here. 'There's a serious criminal network engaged in these types of theft in the UK and across the EU, and it is believed this is linked to the fact there is increased demand for rhino horn,' Ms Sohl said. Rhino horn is just one part of a trade worth an estimated 19 billion US dollars (£12 billion), making it the fourth biggest global illegal trade after narcotics, counterfeiting and human trafficking. The report estimates that unreported and unregulated fisheries is worth 4.2 to 5.9 billion US dollars (£2.6 to £3.7 billion), the illegal timber trade is worth 7 billion US dollars (£4.4 billion) and other wildlife trafficking worth up to 7.8 billion US dollars (£4.8 billion). Among the reasons for the trade is demand for medicines, consumer goods and the desire to possess exotic pets, hunting trophies and rare plants and animals, the study suggested. Illegal wildlife trade thrives in places with widespread corruption, weak law enforcement and where rangers, police officers and customs officials are not sufficiently trained or resourced with new tools such as DNA tracing technology. Ms Sohl said: 'It's a high profit, low risk business, the chances of them being caught in some of these countries is very low, and if that happens there's a great deal of corruption in these countries and they can offer a bribe and you don't see convictions.' WWF and its global wildlife trade programme Traffic want wildlife trafficking to be taken seriously by governments, with improvements to law enforcement, more severe penalties imposed on criminals, efforts to tackle corruption and long-term campaigns to reduce demand for products from consumers. Ms Sohl added that in the UK funding for the National Wildlife Crime Unit was only secured until March 2013, and called for continued funding at the same level and long-term security for the unit to ensure it can develop expertise.","Conservation group WWF warns there is rising demand for rhino horn .

A married New York police officer has denied claims he skipped work to have an affair with a Wall Street executive while on duty. Long Island cop Mike Tedesco allegedly spent 100 nights with girlfriend Tara Obenauer while he should have been on shift. The pair would spend hours having sex, watching TV and napping together, the New York Post reported. Accused: Married cop Mike Tedesco allegedly spent 100 nights with his lover Tara Obenaeur when should have been on duty . Single mother Ms Obenauer says he would lounge around the house in his uniform, watch TV with her two children and bragged that he'd been skipping shifts for 22 years. Tedesco, who lives with his wife and children, would also use his police car to chauffeur her daughter and get ice creams for the children, she claimed. His tryst may have cost the taxpayers an estimated $25,000 - the equivalent to 300 hours' pay out of his $175,000 salary. Tedesco, 43, did not comment as he was led in to the District Attorney’s office early yesterday morning following his arrest. He was supported by his wife Sharon. He denies 80 counts of official . misconduct, 25 counts of falsifying business records, and four counts . of tampering business records. GPS records allegedly show he was dating the two women at the same time. He faces up to seven years in prison if . convicted. State Supreme Court Justice Anthony Marano set bail at $10,000 bond or $5,000 cash. Tedesco is due back in court on January 9. 'Ultimately, not every lapse in judgement amounts to a crime,' said his lawyer, Aida Leisenring. After Tedesco’s arraignment, Nassau District Attorney Kathleen Rice said he 'endangered the public with his selfishness' by reporting to his bosses that he was en route to calls — including a cardiac arrest — when in fact he was still at his lover's house for as long as a half an hour. 'He was late to calls and lied about his whereabouts. His crimes could have cost people their lives,' said Rice. 'He betrayed the public trust. He violated his oath.' When the pair first met, Ms Obenauer was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer and about a month later they began a relationship. Tedesco was caught out when a suspicious neighbour blew the whistle. Suspicious: Neighbors called the police department because they thought it was unusual that a patrol car was parked in Ms Obenauer's Massapequa driveway so often . Ms Obenauer, from Massapequa, assisted Internal Affairs and has obtained an order of protection over fears he will seek retribution. Since the scandal emerged, Tedesco has put in for retirement and is currently collecting a state pension. Nassau has refused to grant him additional accrued pay -- but he is disputing that. Ms Obenauer is also suing Nassau county for $10 million for allowing Tedseco to seduce her under false pretenses. He had been a New York housing officer for four years before serving on the Nassau force for 17 years.

Tragedy: Ana Hernandez, 32, died in June in what are now described as suspicious circumstances . A teacher who is under investigation over his pregnant fiancée's sudden death is in hospital after collapsing in the street. Darren Stott had apparently told his mother he was feeling suicidal over the decision to reopen the investigation into the death of Ana Hernandez, who was found to have taken a lethal cocktail of drugs. Ms Hernandez, a lawyer, allegedly claimed that Stott was trying to poison her shortly before she was found dead at her Yorkshire home in June. An inquest into her death was adjourned last week after her fiancé failed to attend and a coroner said his account of her final days contained 'glaring inconsistencies'. On Sunday Stott, 42, collapsed in the . streets of Gran Canaria, in the Canary Islands where he now lives, and . was believed to be in critical condition in hospital. His . mother Carol told the Daily Telegraph he was 'very seriously ill and . hasn't woken up yet' - adding that earlier that day he told her he had . been having suicidal thoughts over the police investigation. 'He . is utterly devastated and had talked about taking his own life,' she . said as she insisted that he had been planning to co-operate fully with . investigators. On . Tuesday, as he lay in hospital, he was sacked from the school in San . Agustin where he had been working as an English teacher after parents . raised concerns about the suspicious nature of his 32-year-old fiancée's . death. South Yorkshire . police have confirmed that they are re-investigating Ms Hernandez's . death in the light of 'fresh information', but emphasised that no arrest . warrant has been issued for Stott. A post-mortem examination of Ms . Hernandez revealed a cocktail of drugs – none of which had been . prescribed to her – in her system. Tests also revealed the drugs may have been mixed into a spicy stew which she had eaten. Police . initially concluded there was nothing suspicious about the death as she . had been given paracetamol for a headache despite her strong opposition . to the idea. Friends and . relatives of the Spaniard, who was four months pregnant, were stunned by . her sudden death as she was a fitness fanatic and vehemently opposed to . taking medication during pregnancy. Her family insisted the staunch Roman Catholic would never have taken her life. Collapsed: Darren Stott is in critical condition in hospital in Gran Canaria, where now lives . The . inquest heard that Stott, who lectured at Leeds Metropolitan . University before moving to Spain this summer, met Miss Hernandez in the Canary Islands in April 2011. She proposed to him on February 29 and moved in March to live with him in the village of Barnburgh, near Doncaster. A statement from Mr Stott said said when she found out she was pregnant, ‘I was extremely happy and so was Ana’. In early June the couple visited the home of local friends, Geoff and Carolyn Telford, for a drink. Mr Telford said: ‘She told me, “Darren is trying to kill me. He’s trying to make me take drugs.” She wasn’t very happy.’ Mrs Telford said Miss Hernandez complained of a headache and said: ‘He’s trying to kill me with these drugs.’ The inquest was told Mr Stott travelled to Berkshire to attend a course on June 26. His fiancée’s body was found two days later at their three-bedroom bungalow after Mr Stott asked the Telfords to check on her.

Life expectancy around the world has soared, but we are now living with health problems that cause us years of pain, disability and mental distress. This 'devastating irony', as researchers describe it, is one of the key findings of a landmark study assessing the global health in the history of medicine. From 1990 to 2010, life expectancy continued to increase in most parts of the world. The average age of death rose from 59 to 70, with women outliving men by about five years. The map below highlights the average life expectancy by area, with Scandinavia and Australia having the oldest populations. World life expectancy map . The map shows the average life expectancy for men around the world in 2009. The overall global life expectancy has risen from 59 in 1990, to 70 today . However, as the population has aged, the number of years that people live with chronic diseases and disabilities, such as back pain, diabetes, arthritis and depression, has also risen. Today's major health problems now are diseases and conditions that don't kill, but make us ill. We now live longer with more health problems that cause pain, impair mobility, and prevent us seeing, hearing and thinking clearly. These consequences of an ageing population were compiled by researchers from more than 300 institutions from 50 countries around the world. They took data from surveys, censuses and hospital records and used computer models to estimate how long people live and how healthy they are. Smoking and alcohol use have also overtaken child hunger to become the second and third . leading health risks . The Global Burden of Disease study, led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at Washington University, found that countries face a wave of financial and social costs from rising numbers of people living with disease and injury. Among other findings are that while malnutrition has dropped down the rankings as a cause of death and illness, the effects of excessive eating are taking its place. Smoking and alcohol use have also overtaken child hunger to become the second and third leading health risks, behind high blood pressure. Over three million deaths globally were attributable in 2010 to excess body weight, more than three times as many as malnutrition. 'We've gone from a world 20 years ago where people weren't getting enough to eat to a world now where too much food and unhealthy food - even in developing countries - is making us sick,' said Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London, one of the lead researchers. The research also found that of 52.8 million deaths globally in 2010, chronic diseases took the highest tolls. About 12.9 million deaths were due to stroke and heart disease - conditions exacerbated by eating and drinking too much, smoking and taking too little exercise - and eight million were from cancer. HIV/AIDS killed 1.5 million people in 2010, and tuberculosis, another infectious disease, killed 1.2 million. While child mortality has decreased, there has also been a startling 44 percent increase in the number of deaths among adults aged 15 to 49 between 1970 and 2010. This is partly because of increases in violence such as homicide and traffic accidents and the AIDS epidemic, the researchers said. 'Very few people are walking around with perfect health, and as people age, they accumulate health conditions,' said Christopher Murray, the IHME's director. 'This means we should recalibrate what life will be like for us in our 70s and 80s. It also has profound implications for health systems as they set priorities.' The study,  was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and published as seven papers in The Lancet medical journal.","From 1990 to 2010, the global average age of death rose from 59 to 70, with women outliving men by about five years .

Controversy: Shaun Donovan, who is in charge of long-term Sandy recovery, said it may not be worth rebuilding all areas destroyed by Sandy . The man appointed by President Obama to be in charge of helping the rebuilding process following Superstorm Sandy has sparked outrage by saying some areas may not be worth rebuilding at all. Housing and urban development secretary Shaun Donovan said in a news conference Thursday that while many communities will be rebuilt with additional safety precautions, he said that a ‘very small share’ of homes ‘may not make sense to rebuild at all.’ When the massive storm struck on October 29, it destroyed thousands of homes and cost billions of dollars in damage. Donovan, who is running the long-term relief effort following the storm, said Thursday that it didn’t make sense for certain areas destroyed by Sandy to rebuild. ‘It may be as small as a block or a couple of blocks, but that is something we have to think about,’ he said, according to television station NY1. He said that in many cases, it was easiest to rebuild homes with more safety features, including elevating homes and pulling them back from the shore. Donovan also said that sea barriers and other blockades need to be considered to protect the low-lying areas of the city. In the days following the storm, President Obama asked Congress to approve $60.4billion to go to federal Sandy relief. Devastated: A Christmas wreath is displayed on the second floor porch railing of a home adjacent to the fire-damaged zone in Breezy Point, Queens last week . Also on Thursday, the governors of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut issued a powerful plea to Congress to act immediately on their decision to provide aid for states battered by Sandy. Joining the effort were more than 125 prominent CEOs based in New York who also urged Congress to quickly pass a $60billion aid package. Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Andrew Cuomo of New York and Dannel Malloy of Connecticut said no region or state should have to stand alone after a disaster. They wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that Congress hasn't acted in seven weeks following Sandy, taking longer to provide aid than in previous disasters such as Hurricane Katrina. 'Storms and disasters lay waste to communities and deliver damage far beyond the resources and capacity of any single state to recover on its own,' wrote Cuomo and Malloy, both Democrats, and Christie, a Republican. 'This is why Congress has always come to the assistance of Americans facing a recovery effort of this scale.' Damage: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, left, pictured on November 2 in Bayhead, New Jersey surveying the damage: Christie has demanded $60billion in federal support . Meditations in an emergency: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, left, also wrote in on the op-ed piece; Obama, right, has requested $60billion in federal aid . They wrote: 'Americans come together in times of crisis. Our states have stood with your communities when they suffered and faced devastation. It's time for Congress to stand with us.' The CEOS backing the aid include top executives of Time Warner, NBC Universal, Bloomberg, Morgan Stanley, Madison Square Garden and the National Basketball Association. Many of the companies are major media outlets and campaign contributors. 'Americans come together in times of . crisis. Our states have stood with your communities when they suffered . and faced devastation. It's time for Congress to stand with us.' 'This region is the most critical platform for American business and the largest contributor to federal tax revenues,' the CEOs wrote in a letter to congressional leaders sent by The Partnership for New York City, a business advocacy group. 'We believe that failure to expeditiously fund storm relief and recovery will severely weaken this region and worsen our nation's overall fiscal condition.' President Barack Obama a week ago proposed $60.4billion for the states, about three-quarters of what they requested. Now it's in the hands of Congress, which is already in a budget battle to cut spending by January 1. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, is pushing the aid request in the Republican House and told The Associated Press in an interview that the high-stakes budget negotiations already under way when Sandy hit made the requests more challenging. Worth it? Donovan said that some areas may not be worth rebuilding; here, homes in the Rockaways are torn down . 'I'm still reasonably confident we can do this, but it is a concern,' King said. 'But the governors raise a good wake-up call.' Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, said the aid package should be a bipartisan priority. 'Before we leave this year, we must act to provide emergency disaster aid to fund the response to Superstorm Sandy,' Schumer said at a news conference of Senate leaders Thursday, a day after a televised fundraising concert. 'Last night, 2billion people around the world tuned into a benefit concert to help raise money for the Sandy relief efforts.' The governors said their states' legislators had supported aid after previous disasters. 'They did so in the spirit of compassion, recognizing that in times of crisis no region, state or single American should have to stand alone or be left to fend for themselves,' they wrote.","Housing and development secretary Shaun Donovan said some areas may not be worth rebuilding after Superstorm Sandy .

First and youngest: Noah Pozner was the youngest of the 16 six-year-olds who was killed in the shooting on Friday . Just three days after the young children were gunned down in their classrooms, a half-dozen of their bodies are now being prepared for coffins as the first funerals will be held on Monday. The first funeral on Monday is that of Noah Pozner, the youngest of the 16 six-year-old victims. The funeral for his friend Jack Pinto will be held at the same time at a Newtown facility, and a wake will be held for James Mattioli, also 6-years-old, later that afternoon. James and fellow Catholic student Jessica Rekos will both have funeral services at St. Rose  of Lima Church on Tuesday, and Rachel D'Avino is going to be buried in neighboring Watertown that same day. The first adult victim's funeral will take place on Wednesday when the 27-year-old heroic teacher Victoria Soto has her service. Student Daniel Barden will have his funeral on the same day. Those are just six of the 20 funerals for the student victims that the town's clergy need to coordinate and host in the coming week, a task so daunting that 100 funeral directors from across the state have volunteered to help the process. Some have donated use of their hearses and time, while coffin manufacturers have given heart-wrenchingly small child-sized caskets for the victims. The Pozner family, which includes Noah's twin sister Arielle who he called 'his best friend' and their 8-year-old sister Sophia, reportedly moved to Newtown from Brooklyn a year ago because they felt that New York City schools were not safe enough for the young children. House of worship: Noah's funeral will be held at the Adath Israel temple on Monday, kicking off a grim week where 20 young children and six of their teachers are laid to rest . 'The reason they moved to that area is because they did not consider any school in New York state on the same level. That's one of the reasons they moved, for safety and education,' Noah's uncle Arthur Pozner told CBS News. Arielle survived because she had been assigned to a different class than her brother, placing her out of the gunman's path when the shooting took place. Noah's mother was supported by their family rabbi when she saw her son's dead body for the first time on Sunday. The New York Times reports that she listened to the suggestion of the social worker who warned that she should not lift the sheet covering the boy's corpse, which only exposed his head and neck. Newtown's only undertaker is so overwhelmed with grisly mortuary tasks like covering up bullet holes that he has been forced to hire an additional 30 staffers. Daniel Honan, the director of Honan Funeral Home, said he’s hired between 25 and 30 new staffers to handle the 11 victims from Friday's Sandy Hook massacre, reports the Daily News. Honan said the additional workers will help handle what called it 'the week from hell.' 'I’ve never seen anything like this, never,” Honan said. 'We added staff to meet the demand and do what we do.' Since the funeral home opened in 1903, none of the previous generations of morticians has been tasked with providing services for so many grieving families at once, according to the News. Honan said his staff is working around the clock for a week’s worth of wakes. And to conceal gruesome bullet holes. 'We’re trained to cover them up,' he said. 'We have people with special skills to do that. Some caskets will be open and some will be closed.'

Two Mexican police officers have found themselves on the wrong side of the law after they were arrested this week for looting from the site of music superstar Jenni Rivera's fatal plane crash. The officers were caught after images of the crash site were found on one of the arrested officers' cell phones - the same images leaked to the Mexican media this week, according to the Nuevo Leon state government. The extremely graphic photos depicted body parts and personal documents belonging to those aboard the doomed flight, including Rivera, 43, a singer and reality star known as the 'Queen of Banda.'

The former champion runner - who claimed he worked 19-hour days in the run-up to the London Games - said he owed much of his success to the woman who first taught him to 'balance' his lifestyle . Angela Coe died in 2005 aged 75 from progressive supranuclear palsy, or PSP, an incurable brain condition that affects fewer than six in 100,000 people. Hosting a fundraising event for the PSP Association on Tuesday, Lord Coe said watching her health decline in the five years before her death was ‘hideous’. He said: ‘My mother was what the empire was made of. So she was quite stoic when she was diagnosed. ‘But it is a pretty hideous disease. The last few years were hideous. ‘First of all, she slowed up, which I guess you are allowed to do in your early 70s. But it was quite dramatic. ‘This was a woman who was playing football with her grandchildren, reading five books a day and just on top of her game. ‘After we first noticed her symptoms, we spent a year and a half going to pillar to post to specialists who didn’t know enough to identify the disease. Lord Sebastian Coe, Chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (seen here with TV presenter Gabby Logan) ‘It was a big burden on my family and on my father, who was a lot older than her and having to deal with his own frailties as well as become a full-time carer.’ Coached by his father Peter, Lord Coe won two Olympic middle-distance gold medals between 1980 and 1986. But the former runner said his mother played just as significant a role in his future success by teaching him to manage his workload. He said: ‘The London Olympics has been most days of the week including Saturdays and Sundays five until midnight. I mean five in the morning until midnight. ‘I have always been very good at being able to structure my time. My mother had a huge influence on me. My dad was my coach. He was a hugely influential figure. ‘But my mum was critical in getting me to recognise very early on that although what I was doing was pretty serious, quite selfish and probably to most people pretty obsessive, there actually was more to life than running quickly twice round a track. 'Mum was critical in getting me to recognise very early on that although what I was doing was pretty serious... there was actually was more to life than running quickly twice round a track.' Above, Coe wins the men's 1500m at the XXII Summer Olympic Games in Moscow . ‘So she sort of kept the balance there.’ He added: ‘She was a fixture around running tracks. 'Whenever we were racing or training in or around London, she would end up cooking for the other athletes, including Steve Ovett and Daley Thompson. ‘She was a massive influence on everything I did.’ Lord Coe will take on another high-pressure role next month, when he is elected chairman of the British Olympic Association. Despite taking just a ‘few days’ of holiday since the Olympics, he denied being addicted to work, saying: ‘I don’t think I am a workaholic. I prefer to keep busy. It is better than the alternative. ‘What I am really quite keen to hold on to is a little more weekend time.

History of drug abuse: Steroids were found in the room where Garrett Reid, pictured, died from an accidental heroin overdose . A probe into the fatal heroin overdose of Garrett Reid, the oldest son of Philadelphia Eagles coach Andy Reid, revealed there were steroids discovered near his body on the day he died, a Pennsylvania prosecutor said on Monday. Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said that anabolic steroids were found in the room where Garrett Reid was staying when he overdosed on heroin on August 5 during Eagles training camp. Reid was helping the team's strength and conditioning coach at the time of his death. Morganelli said there was no evidence that Reid was giving the steroids to any Eagles players, and that investigators could not determine if the drugs were for Reid's own use or for distribution. He showed little appetite for a deeper probe. 'The issue of steroids, it's an illegal substance in Pennsylvania law. It has probably more significance in the sports world. But since it did not appear to be related to his death, we're not pursuing that any further,' Morganelli said. Morganelli said in October that investigators found 47 syringes and 65 needles . in Reid's gym bag, many of them unopened. Also found were spoons and 19 vials of an unknown liquid. Eagles Chairman Jeffrey Lurie called the news of the steroids disappointing, and noted that neither the organization nor the players were aware or involved with anything related to steroids. 'It's clear the conduct in which he apparently engaged runs counter to the values and principles mandated for everyone associated with our organization. We have spoken with the league office and have pledged our full cooperation with their requests should there be any,' Lurie said. 'While we remained saddened by the tragic end of a young man's life and know how hard this must be for the entire Reid family, we are extremely confident that Garrett's actions were unknown to those around him and did not involve our football team.' Coach: Garret Reid is the son of Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid, pictured during a game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday . Reid's body was found in his dorm room at Lehigh University in Bethlehem. The coroner said the 29-year-old died of an accidental heroin overdose. Lehigh University police were called to the dorm room around 7:20am on August 5, arriving after Eagles team physician Dr Omar Elkhamra had tried to revive him with a defibrillator. Investigators searching his room found a used syringe and spoon, along with a gym bag filled with dozens of syringes and needles, many of them unopened, as well as 19 vials of an unknown liquid. Testing revealed the vials contained four types of anabolic steroids, Morganelli said. But said he did not have any evidence that Reid was distributing steroids to players. Asked how aggressively his office and Lehigh University's police department pursued the question, Morganelli said: 'Lots of interviews were conducted by the police. And I can't go into all of them, but all I can say is that we could not provide any evidence or substantiate that anybody in the Eagles organization was involved in this, or whether or not this was for his personal use. It was just undetermined.' Philadelphia Eagles coach Andy Reid, center, is embraced after the funeral for his son Garrett Reid on Tuesday August 2, when some 900 people attended . Britt Reid, center left, is embraced after the funeral for his brother Garrett who had a long battle with drug addiction . He acknowledged the quantity found could have been intended for distribution, 'but what I'm saying is I have no evidence of that, that there was any distribution by Mr Reid, either here or anywhere else.' The prosecutor said he had not been in touch either with the NFL or the Eagles organization. In a statement, Andy Reid said he was 'confident that my son's decisions did not affect our football team in any way.' 'I cannot apologize enough for any adverse appearances that my son's actions may have for an organization and a community that has been nothing but supportive of our family,' the Eagles coach said. It wasn't clear if Reid had steroids in his system at the time of his death. Northampton County Coroner Zachary Lysek did not immediately return a phone call. Once the corner determined that Reid had succumbed to heroin, investigators focused on learning who had supplied him with it, combing through Reid's phone records to see who he was calling and texting before his death. But Morganelli said that probe ran into a dead end. 'It cannot be determined whether Mr. Reid obtained heroin here in the Lehigh Valley or brought it with him to training camp from elsewhere,' Morganelli said, adding that Lehigh University police has closed the investigation. Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli announces his findings in the death of Garrett Reid, saying it was an accidental overdose of heroin . 'I don't want to be that kid who was the son of the head coach of the Eagles, who was spoiled and on drugs and OD'd and just faded into oblivion,' Garrett told a judge in 2007. His dad is being hugged, center . Reid seemed to have rebounded from a long struggle with drug abuse that at times jeopardized his father's job. He was sentenced to nearly two years in prison for a 2007 high-speed car crash that injured another driver. Police said Reid was high on heroin, and they found the drug and more than 200 pills in his car. More recently, exercise and training had become his passion and he aspired to make it a career. At the time of his death, he had been helping strength and conditioning coach Barry Rubin. But an autopsy revealed his body showed signs of chronic drug use. Reid's younger brother, Britt, has also struggled with drug use and was arrested on the same day as Garrett in 2007 after a road-rage incident. Police discovered weapons and drugs in Britt Reid's vehicle. He now works as a graduate assistant coach at Temple.

As Bradley Wiggins was released from hospital following an accident in Lancashire on Wednesday, the head coach of Great Britain was rushed to A&E in Manchester suffering bleeding on the brain after being knocked off his bike. Shane Sutton, 55, one of Wiggins' coaches for his time trial success at the London Olympics, was hospitalised with bleeding and bruising on the brain following the road accident in Levenshulme, Manchester, on Thursday. The incident came less than 24 hours after Wiggins, who was out training, was knocked off his bike by a Vauxhall Astra as it . pulled out of a filling station. Charming: Bradley Wiggins swore at photographers on his way home from hospital on Thursday . 'Ok': Wiggins left with at least two broken ribs after being knocked off his bike by a car . Hospitalised: Shane Sutton, Team GB's head cycling coach, was rushed to hospital on Thursday afternoon . He lay on the floor for a . quarter of an hour before the ambulance arrived, according to witnesses, and sustained at least two broken ribs and a suspected dislocated finger.

The spokesperson added: 'It is extremely rare that our riders and coaches are hurt while out cycling on the road, even rarer that two incidents should occur in a short space of time, and we wish Shane and Bradley a speedy recovery. 'Cycling is not an intrinsically dangerous activity but there is much more to be done to improve conditions for cyclists on the roads. 'British Cycling is calling on the government to put cycling at the heart of transport policy to ensure that cycle safety is built into the design of all new roads, junctions and transport projects, rather than being an afterthought.' Police sources said the collision involving Sutton, on his bike, and a Peugeot 206 car took place at about 8.55am near the junction of Stockport Road and Clare Road in Levenshulme. The driver of the Peugeot was not injured and no arrests were made. British Cycling director Martin Gibbs . believes the Government should be doing more to prevent such incidents, and said: 'These . incidents do remind you that we've got a long way to go we need to look . to our cousins abroad and Copenhagen and see what they've done. '30 per cent of people making journey there do so on their bike. 'We need the Department of Transport to stop thinking of cycling as an add-on.

Mentor: Sutton was one of Wiggins' coaches when he sealed a time trial gold at London 2012 . He was awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list in 2010 for his services to sport. Sutton's career began as a road and track cyclist where he won numerous . titles including a Commonwealth Games gold medal in the 1978 team . pursuit competition and the 1990 Milk Race. He split his time between the track and the road in coaching this year's British competitors at the London Olympics. Throughout his career at GB Cycling, . he was said by Team Sky to have 'repeatedly got the best out of his . charges through his sheer enthusiasm and force of personality'. Police also confirmed that Wiggins, 32, has broken at least two ribs but has otherwise escaped with severe bruising. His support team who were following him raced to his aid at Wrightington, Lancashire, close to his home near Chorley. The mum of the cycling champion has spoken to the star since the crash. Linda Wiggins, a school secretary, said: 'I have spoken to him briefly and he's okay.' Garage attendant Yasmin Smith, who also helped Wiggins, said: ‘By the time I got there he had moved to a safer place but was still on the ground and he was in a lot of pain. 'His hands looked bruised and they were curled up a bit. And then his colour changed.'He got put in a local person's car and when the ambulance came they attended to him immediately. His wife [tried to] hug him and he said: 'Don't, my ribs'.'He was assisted [in] walking to the ambulance. He could stand up. I think his ribs and hands were the main concern. ‘He said he thought he had broken his ribs and while a lot of police cars arrived it was about 15 minutes before the ambulance got there and by then he was blue.’ Another witness, truck driver Barry Blacklidge, arrived shortly after the incident. He told The Sun: 'I could see a pushbike, like a mountain bike, and the front wheel was all buckled. I went into the garage and asked what was going on.

An Iraqi policeman has claimed he was strangled, beaten with a rifle butt and told he would be murdered by an undercover SAS soldier during an interrogation. The officer is one of nine people who say they were tortured by Special Forces troops trying to track down the killers of six British military policemen – known as Red Caps – in Iraq. Ahmed Al-Maliki and his colleagues, who are claiming damages from the Government for their physical and psychological injuries, have spoken for the first time about their alleged ordeal. Ordeal: One Iraqi policeman after the alleged beating. Nine people claim to have been tortured by Special Forces troops . But their bid for compensation has also caused dismay. Iraq War hero Colonel Tim Collins last night described lawyers representing the policemen as ‘a cynical bunch of ambulance-chasers’. Mr Al-Maliki, 41, described how on June 30, 2003, about 20 SAS soldiers who were posing as Red Caps and wearing their traditional berets entered the police station in the southern Iraqi town of Majar al-Kabir. The soldiers, armed with automatic rifles, allegedly attacked the police officers after their questions about who killed the Red Caps went unanswered. Mr Al-Maliki said: ‘During the incident I was violently beaten with a rifle to my back and legs.’ He added: ‘A soldier placed his hands around my neck and applied great pressure. He said, “Provide me with information or I will kill you.” The soldier was very tall and strong. He was white-skinned and clean-shaven. Even after 100 years, I would still recognise him. ‘He held my neck for around 30 seconds . and I was strangled two more times with so much pressure I couldn’t . breathe. Afterwards, another soldier, who was wearing a red cap, applied . a scarf around my neck. I was then dragged along the floor by my neck – . all because I could not tell them what they wanted to hear.’ Treatment: Ahmed Al-Maliki was allegedly beaten with a rifle to his back and legs and strangled . Mr Al-Maliki says he suffered serious injuries to his throat, back and legs that required medical treatment. He later left the police force. He has pledged to co-operate with a criminal investigation launched by Ministry  of Defence police. The soldiers could face jail if found guilty of abusing the policemen. Mr Al-Maliki said: ‘For ten days, I couldn’t swallow properly and I was drinking through a straw. I want to know why this happened to me and who was responsible.’ The top-secret SAS operation was launched hours after the six Red Caps, led by Sergeant Simon Hamilton-Jewell, were executed by an Iraqi mob at the Majar  al-Kabir police station. The Iraqi policemen they were training fled the gun-toting protesters. Another policeman, Mustafa Jbara, 31, pleaded with the SAS soldiers that he knew nothing about the Red Caps’ deaths. He claims that during his ordeal he was forced to maintain painful stress positions – an interrogation technique banned under UK law since the Seventies. He said: ‘I was lying face down in the corridor of the police station with my colleagues. The soldiers kept stepping on our backs. I was also made to squat down, placing my hands on my head. When I tried to link my fingers so I could balance better, a soldier struck my hands with the butt of his rifle. It was very frightening. Red Cap Simon Hamilton-Jewell was executed by an Iraqi mob along with five others . ‘I was kicked hard, punched and beaten with rifles. I could hear my colleagues screaming and the soldiers laughing. It was painful and humiliating. Afterwards, we were made to do sit-ups and tied together with plastic cuffs.’ The nine policemen were eventually released. Some underwent X-rays although no fractures were found and no surgery was carried  out. However, according to medical reports, the policemen suffered internal injuries and severe bruising. Dr Adnan Mohammed, head  of medicine at Majar al-Kabir  hospital, who examined the men, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Most of the patients were suffering from hypotension. They had bruising and evidence of trauma to the back, neck and legs. Some had bruising around their wrists. ‘I have never seen policemen attacked like that. A lot of people changed their attitudes towards the British as a result of that day.’ However, Col Collins, who served as an SAS officer before the Iraq War, said the soldiers were within their rights to adopt a robust approach. He said: ‘If the policemen did get pushed around, I’m not surprised because this incident took place in brutal circumstances. ‘Lives had been taken and there was potential for more lives to be lost. This was rough handling, not torture. Whatever it takes to get information is acceptable, so long as no permanent damage is done. What we have here is a cynical bunch of ambulance-chasing lawyers going after compensation.’ The MoD has already paid millions of pounds to claimants who alleged abuse in southern Iraq, where UK troops were based between 2003 and 2009. Anna Crowther, of law firm Leigh Day & Co, which is representing the nine men, said: ‘The recent disturbing revelations regarding the involvement of the SAS in this incident puts more pressure on the British Government to provide proper answers as to who was involved in these assaults and at what level this was sanctioned by the UK.’ A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘We are committed to investigating all cases of alleged abuse by UK service personnel  in Iraq. ‘We are currently investigating these specific allegations so it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.’","Ahmed Al-Maliki and colleagues are claiming damages from Government .

And despite having avoided prison for an almost identitcal offence involving a glass in a pub four years ago, Robson, 27, was handed a suspended sentence and ordered to do community service. In a victim statement Miss Pulford, 30, told how the attack left her feeling sickened and shocked at what her one time lodger was capable of. Robson was ordered to do 200 hours community service and to pay £300 in compensation after admitting the attack. Sentencing Robson, Judge Gillian Matthews QC, said: 'It was unpleasant and it is serious - using a weapon in a public place causing a wound merits custody. 'I have had to pause long and hard to consider this. When you walked into the dock this morning, I was very clear I would be sending you to custody. 'Taking into account all the positive factors I know about you and that this was not a prolonged indcident, I can suspend the sentence of imprisonment.' Robson's barrister Dan Cordley said that the though of jail had 'worried her greatly'. He told the judge that Robson cares for her disabled mother and brother and provided references which 'give an indication of another side to her.' Free: Colleen Robson, 27, was spared jail at Teesside Crown Court, pictured . The court heard how the two women fell out about two years ago and Robson's attempts via Facebook to rekindle the friendship were rebuffed. Since the incident, she has been barred from pubs and clubs, and Mr Cordey said: 'She has willingly abided by that. She realises it has got her into trouble.' He added: 'If she doesn't go to custody today, Colleen Robson knows it will be by the skin of her teeth and that there will be no further chances.'","Colleen Robson left Charlene Pulford needing stitches to a three inch gash on the top of her head after the attack in Darlington .

While the pain of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting is felt across the nation, the sports world is no different - as several players took part in pregame ceremonies and honoring the victims in their own way. Miami Heat star LeBron James, who has two children about the same age as Newtown, Connecticut's youngest victims, felt the pain of the parents who lost their kids when gunman Adam Lanza forced his way into the school and began firing.

James and teammate Dwyane Wade came up with the idea. They said that if they were going to honor the victims of the shooting, then they wanted their own children to share in that solemn tribute. James said: 'Basketball, . this is nothing. These games are nothing compared to when you have a . tragedy like that.

Luxury perfume brands fear the European Union's new laws against allergens could severely curb or ban natural ingredients used in vintage best-sellers and put some perfume makers out of business. But Brussels' proposed legislation — a draft will be unveiled early next year — is also causing a stir for another reason. It sheds light on the best-kept secret in the £20billion trade: many big brands have been tweaking their formulas for years. 'It is a taboo in the industry. People are scared to say anything about it,' said Fflur Roberts, head of luxury goods at market research company Euromonitor. Brands like Dior, left, and Guerlain, right, will be most affected by the new regulations as their fragrances use many natural ingredients and were created before scientists started looking into potential health hazards . The brands most affected will be those which have been in the perfume industry for more than half a century, such as Dior, Chanel and Guerlain. All those fragrances use many natural ingredients and were created before scientists started looking into perfumes' potential health hazards. Chanel's No.5, one of the world's best-selling perfumes and named after its creator's fifth trial, was created in 1921. Chanel declined to comment on whether it has ever changed the formula of its world-famous perfume, as did Guerlain, Dior and luxury brand Hermes, which all make high-end perfumes using natural ingredients. Most luxury perfume names do not want to disclose the fact that they have had to make tweaks to their scents for fear they could lose customers or damage their carefully nurtured luxury brand. Perfume lovers, though, are hard to fool. 'Consumers know their perfume better than any expert,' said Jean Guichard, who heads the perfume school in Paris set up in 1946 by Swiss fragrance maker Givaudan. Chanel's No.5, one of the world's best-selling perfumes and named after its creator's fifth trial, was created in 1921 . 'We say nothing to consumers, but they . notice when their fragrance has been changed and they may decide to opt . for another product. Brands need to be careful when they reformulate . their perfumes as they can lose consumers.' Until now, changes to perfume formulas . have come as a result of increasingly severe restrictions imposed by . the industry's self-regulatory body, the International Fragrance . Association (IFRA). 'Most perfumes which are 20 years old or . more will have already been reformulated several times because science . has evolved and we want to ensure the safety of consumers,' said IFRA . president Pierre Sivac. If new, even stricter rules are adopted, hundreds of perfumes would have to be reformulated with synthetic allergen-free contents. That, many in the industry fear, could threaten their business. 'If this law goes ahead I am finished, as my perfumes are all filled with these ingredients,' said Frederic Malle, who owns high-end perfume company Editions de Parfums Frederic Malle. The impact on luxury perfume brands as a whole would, he said, be 'like an atomic explosion and we would not have the means to rebuild ourselves.' Most fine perfumes are composed of a mix of natural ingredients and synthetic molecules. Changing a scent can cost several hundred thousand euros depending on the complexity of the original formula, and perfume makers say that replacing natural with synthetic ingredients is rarely an improvement. Many traditional essences that perfume creators consider core to their craft have been blacklisted in recent decades. Birch tar oil was removed from Guerlain's Shalimar several decades ago because it was thought to be a cancer risk. Clove oil and rose oil, which contain a component called eugenol, and lavender, which contains linalool, may only be used in limited quantities in case of allergies. And oakmoss, one of the most commonly used raw materials because of its rich, earthy aroma and ability to 'fix' a perfume to make it last longer, has been increasingly restricted because of worries about skin sensitivity. Changing a scent can cost several hundred thousand euros depending on the complexity of the original formula . That means perfumes like Shalimar, Chanel's No. 5, Dior's Eau Sauvage and Poison, Yves Saint Laurent's Opium and Cacharel's Anais Anais are only a shadow of their original, olfactory selves, according to industry experts. 'Eau Sauvage was a real [masterpiece] in its original form,' retired perfume-maker Pierre Bourdon, who created Dior's Dolce Vita and Yves Saint Laurent's Kouros, said of the 1966 scent. 'It used to be very green and fresh. Today, it has been replaced by something softer and duller.' He contends the scent has been stripped of furocoumarins, a kind of organic chemical compound produced by plants like bergamot that can cause dark spots on the skin when exposed to the sun. Mr Bourdon said he still wore Eau Sauvage . because it reminded him of his father, Rene, who as deputy head of Dior . perfumes in the 1960s and 1970s supervised the creation of the perfume. 'Eau Sauvage was a real [masterpiece] in its original form,' retired perfume-maker Pierre Bourdon said . If the industry largely got away with quietly tweaking its fragrances up till now, however, experts say that will be impossible if Europe backs the proposals aimed at wiping allergenic substances from the perfume-makers' palettes altogether. Brigitte Aubert, a 68-year-old Parisian interior decorator, gave up Shalimar in the 1980s after developing an allergy to it. 'My neck became all red but I continued wearing Shalimar for a long time. It was part of my identity, I couldn't just give it up,' she said. 'It reminded me of those carefree days of Paris in the 1960s.' Aubert is one of an estimated five million to 15 million people, or one to three per cent of the EU population who are allergic or potentially allergic to natural ingredients contained in fine perfumes, according to a report published in July by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS). Patrick Saint-Yves, president of the French Society of Perfume Creators (SFP), is furious about the recommendation. 'I simply find that there is a huge . contradiction,' Saint-Yves said. 'We encourage the use of many essential . oils such as lavender in aromatherapy for massages, but we want to ban . it in perfumes. Shops continue to sell alcohol and cigarettes which do . much more harm.' Part of the problem is the secrecy . surrounding perfumes. Most perfume brands are reluctant to label their . products. In 2005, the EU passed a law in 2005 forcing perfume brands to label any of 26 . potentially allergenic ingredients. The brands now list those . ingredients — but in Latin. Now the SCCS is proposing to extend that list to . more than 100 potential allergens. Europe is not the only region to look . more closely at the impact of fragrance.

Struggling stores are slashing prices by up to 80 per cent as they launch the greatest Christmas sales ever seen to tempt back  missing shoppers. The number of customers in the high street and shopping centres is considerably down on last year and those who are out are spending less, according to the British Retail Consortium. As a result, bargains normally reserved for January sales are available at almost every shop from John Lewis to Laura Ashley. Mass sales: Nearly 70 per cent of stores are running sales or pre-Christmas promotions . A spokesman for accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers said: ‘Slow sales appear to have spooked retailers, causing them to cut their prices.’ Its research shows that 69 per cent of retailers are running sales or advertising promotions in their shop window. The average discount being advertised is 36 per cent. Retailers have adopted a three-point battle plan to try to boost sales during what is a make-or-break period in the final days before Christmas. Opening hours are being extended late into the night, with hundreds of supermarkets trading around the clock over most of the next ten days. Time to find a bargain: High street retailers are being forced to compete with cheaper online stores . Marks & Spencer, for example, will open a number of stores until midnight, and some Waitrose outlets will be open until 11pm. Most household-name retailers have launched ‘secret sales’ by issuing money-off vouchers and discount codes to be used in their online stores. At the same time, bargain deals are the order of the day at high street chains such as Gap, Laura Ashley, M&S, Debenhams, House of Fraser, H&M and Argos. Retail analyst Jonathan De Mello said: ‘We are seeing deeper discounts than ever before. ‘There has been a big drop in footfall that has meant that shops are having to offer heavy discounts to attract people and high street retailers are also having to compete with prices online. ‘Certain department stores have started their sales a lot earlier this year and we are starting to see really substantial price cuts.’ This weekend will be a particularly busy time for internet retailers, although sales will depend heavily on whether shoppers have confidence that the bad weather will not – as in previous years – disrupt deliveries. The British Retail Consortium said the number of people out Christmas shopping was disappointing. Its research, compiled by Barclaycard, shows visitors to shopping centres down 4.9 per cent on this time last year, while the fall is 0.8 per cent in out-of-town malls and 0.4 per cent in the high street. This translates to an overall reduction of 1.7 per cent. BRC director general Stephen Robertson said: ‘People who haven’t got spare money aren’t shopping and cold weather may have motivated many to stay indoors and do shopping online rather than venturing out in freezing conditions.’ Barclaycard said it expects retailers to step up their reductions from Monday and a sharp rise in the number of shoppers. A spokesman said: ‘The same week last year saw spending growth shoot up 7 per cent as retailers moved to get rid of remaining stock. Saturday, December 22, is expected to be the single biggest day of the season.’","Christmas spending is down on last year, British Retail Consortium reports .

Doctors could be forced to work at weekends under plans to create a health service with supermarket-style opening hours. Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS’s medical director, said that patients, like shoppers, should be entitled to the same quality of service on Saturday and Sunday as during the week. He said it was no longer acceptable for hospitals and GPs’ surgeries to operate for the convenience of their staff at the expense of patients and that clinics and day case operations should be available seven days a week. It should also be possible to get weekend hospital appointments for scans and GPs should provide slots to treat patients at weekends, he said. The proposal is to be considered by the NHS Commissioning Board in an effort to improve access to healthcare. He told the Sunday Times: 'Our system has been based around providing as good a working environment as you can for the people who work in the health service, which isn't necessarily matched with what the people who want services have. 'If you wanted a day case operation, and you didn't want to take a day off work, why can't you have it on a Saturday or Sunday?' 'Tesco have had to go through this  - it was a complex issue for them - we will need to look at the terms and conditions or service of people.' He added that having empty clinics and operating theatres on a Saturday and Sunday is a waste of NHS resources. Research by the board found that a patient admitted to hospital on a Sunday was 16 per cent more likely to die than if they were admitted on a Wednesday. Keogh can introduce the changes and implement financial rewards and penalties to ensure that hospitals follow the guidelines. Contract changes: Many medical professionals will have to work Saturdays and Sundays for the first time . The plans will no doubt anger doctors who will be keen to protect their current working hours. Medical professionals will not receive any extra money for working weekends but will be given days off in the week instead. The proposals will be fully outlined in the NHS Commissioning Board's first planning guidance which will detail how health funds will be spent ahead and which will be released on Tuesday. The British Medical Association (BMA) last night rejected the idea that that the medical profession could learn from private firms such as Tesco but it was 'open' to discussing seven day working.","Oupatients appointments and surgical procedures could be carried out on Saturdays and Sundays for the first time .

He was told he could not wear the brightly coloured strip because it was not the Middlesex side's 'official colours'. Pretty in pink: Jack Turner (pictured) was banned from wearing a pink football kit which he had made to raise money for a breast cancer charity . He said: ‘I felt wearing the kit was the least I could do to support my mum and raise some money for charity in the process. ‘I expected to get a bit of attention from away fans but they have been very supportive. I cannot believe the league's attitude. ‘I . am not harming anyone and just trying to raise awareness. I never . wanted to cause any trouble and do not understand what all the fuss is . about.’ Staines, who play in the Blue Square South - five divisions below the Premier League, have even been threatened with a fine if Mr Turner defies the ban. Heartbreaking: Mr Turner also wanted to wear the kit to support his mother who had breast cancer . Mrs Turner, meanwhile, has blasted the ruling as 'heartless'. She said: ‘The league are out of touch and need to grow a heart. ‘I am recovering from breast cancer along with my mother and my cousin, who have also got cancer and because pink is associated with that, Jack had this idea to wear the kit. ‘He has taken quite a lot of stick from visiting fans regarding the colour of his kit, but when they realise the reason he wears it they applaud and support him. ‘Recently supporters of Tonbridge Angels even passed a hat around behind his goal and at Farnborough the same thing happened. ‘No club has ever objected to him wearing pink at home matches but the Conference say it is unprofessional - despite being told exactly why he wears it. ‘All my son is trying to do it support me, the charity and raise awareness.’ Mr Turner, who played professionally for AFC Wimbledon, is not the first soccer star to wear pink in aid of charity. Former England goalkeeper David James spent a year risking the wrath of away fans while playing for Portsmouth in 2009 to generate funds for the Wessex Cancer Trust. The Premier League turned a blind eye but Conference general manager Dennis Strudwick has ordered Mr Turner to revert to Staines's registered colours of all-blue.

City's JFK Airport. A second plane was discovered to have loose seats on Monday after taking off for Miami and was forced to return to JFK. Flight 443 left Kennedy at 7.11 am and returned to the gate around an hour later. After a delay of two hours, passengers continued on their journey. Airline and government officials discouraged speculation that the incidents could be related to labor-management tension at American, which is cutting labor costs and laying off maintenance workers as it tries to turn around under bankruptcy protection. Last week American accused some pilots of conducting an illegal work slowdown that has led to a spike in delayed and canceled flights. The airline threatened to take the pilots' union to court. The delays and cancellations have annoyed passengers, but even the hint of mechanical issues could frighten them away and even threaten American's existence, experts said. 'These things can kill an airline,' said George Hobica, founder of travel website airfarewatchdog.com. 'With a delay or cancellation, you're sitting on the ground. (With loose seats) if the plane hits turbulence, people go flying.'

Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry . analyst in San Francisco, said that if travelers perceive maintenance to . be lax, 'passengers will start booking away from American Airlines in . droves. This is very serious stuff. You need to get corporate security . involved'. The Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 10,000 pilots, said the incident could have been a real disaster. 'A row of seats basically became . unbolted from the floor. The seats were completely not attached,' said . Sam Mayer, a New York-based AA pilot and spokesman for the Allied Pilots . Association to The New York Post. 'With . turbulence, you have to be cautious. That’s why everyone has to stow . everything under the seat to prevent loose objects from flying around . the cabin — and you’ve got a whole row of seats unbolted.' He said that in his 24 years with American, he had never heard of such an incident. According to Mr Mayer, the passengers alerted the crew after takeoff, but the Boeing 757 was already too far out to return to Logan Airport. The crew urgently requested an emergency landing at JFK, where a crash-emergency response unit waited for them. Since the flight had a full tank of fuel, the pilot had to land 'heavy', a dangerous maneuver. The plane made it safely to JFK at 12:48pm on Saturday morning. American spokeswoman Mary Frances Fagan said the passengers in the 'wobbly' row were relocated to safer seats. 'A second aircraft was used to continue the flight to Miami,' she said to MailOnline.

As incongruous as it may seem for the . 85-year-old Benedict to be on Twitter, Vatican officials have stressed . that he is merely walking in the footsteps of his predecessors in using . the latest in communications technology to spread the faith. Pope Pius XI, for example, caused a . similar stir when he launched Vatican Radio some 80 years ago to bring . the pope's message on radio waves around the globe. The Vatican also has . its own newspaper, television service and maintains dedicated YouTube . channels and an Internet news portal. Although Pope Benedict sent today's first tweet . himself, in the future most will be written by aides . and he will sign them off before they are sent. The tweets will be going out in Spanish, English, Italian, Portuguese, . German, Polish, Arabic and French. Other languages will be added in the . future. Greg Burke, senior media advisor to the Vatican said the Twitter handle @Pontifex is appropriate for a number of reasons. 'The . handle is a good one. It means ""pope"" and it also means ""bridge . builder"",' he said. 'The Pope wants to reach out to everyone. 'We are going to get a spiritual . message. The Pope is not going to be walking around with a Blackberry or . an iPad and no one is going to be putting words into the Pope's mouth. 'He will tweet what he wants to tweet,' Burke said. Primarily . the tweets will come from the contents of his weekly general audience, . Sunday blessings and homilies on major Church holidays. They will also include reaction to major world events, such as natural disasters. But while the Pope will be one of the . world's most high-profile tweeters and have many followers, he will not . be following anyone himself. The . Pope's Twitter page is designed in yellow and white - the colours of . the Vatican, with a backdrop of the Vatican and his picture. Livery: The official account features Vatican livery and images of the city state, as well as the Pope's signature . It may change during different liturgical seasons of the year and when he is away from the Vatican on trips. The Vatican said precautions had been taken to make sure the Pope's certified account is not hacked. Only one computer in the Vatican's secretariat of state will be used for the tweets. Pope Benedict XVI blessed the possibilities of social media last year but warned it may lead to isolation. 'The . Pope's presence on Twitter is a concrete expression of his conviction . that the Church must be present in the digital arena,' the Vatican said. 'This initiative is best understood . in the context of his reflections on the importance of the cultural . space that has been brought into being by the new technologies ... the . Pope's presence on Twitter can be seen as the 'tip of the iceberg' that . is the Church's presence in the world of new media,' it said in a . statement. Mass: Pope Benedict XVI sits by a crib during his weekly general audience this morning . The Pope, who still writes his speeches and books by hand, has given a qualified blessing to social networking. In . a document issued last year, he said the possibilities of new media and . social networks offered 'a great opportunity', but warned of the risks . of depersonalisation, alienation, self-indulgence, and the dangers of . having more virtual friends than real ones. The . Vatican decided against using a personal Facebook page for the pope . because they thought it was too personal an interaction and would . require more manpower to keep updated. In . 2009, a new Vatican website, www.pope2you.net, went live, offering an . application called 'The Pope meets you on Facebook"", and another . allowing the faithful to see the pontiff's speeches and messages on . their iPhones or iPods.

A sensational plot by an assassin and a drugs baron to escape jail by helicopter has been foiled by guards. Gang leader Mark Osborne and hitman Wayne Collins hatched a plan to break-out from Gartree prison in Leicester, which was the scene of Britain's only other helicopter prison escape in 1987. But guards at the Category B prison were tipped-off about the plan and swooped on their cells, making the duo wear a striped outfit given to 'potential escapees'. Mark (left) and Tony (middle) Osborne and gunman Wayne Collins . According to the Daily Star Sunday, . they were then transferred to high-security prisons - Osborne to . Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire and Collins to Full Sutton in East . Yorkshire. A prison insider . told the paper: 'Osborne and Collins were plotting to escape.They had . built up a plan and had been raising the funds for the operation for . months.' It is believed the pair were to pay for the operation through drug running - both inside and outside prison. Bold: Hitman Wayne Collins and drug baron Mark Osborne wanted to escape Gartree prison in Leics in a helicopter . Osborne, 29, and his brother Tony supplied hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of cocaine in the Romford area of Essex. They hired gunman Collins to execute Mark Tredinnick in front of his four-year-old son in June 2007. Mark Osborne used a phone that was smuggled into his jail cell to order the assassination of Tredinnick, 39. He was shot nine times after being ambushed in a country lane in Romford as partner Kerri Ann Shanahan and their son looked on. Tredinnick had owed money to Osborne, who was in jail for wounding at the time of the killing. He believed Tredinnick had stolen drugs from him. The Osbornes and Collins all got life sentences for the murder in 2009. All three had appeals rejected and it is said the failure sparked the escape plot. The source added: 'There were suspicions they were still involved in drug dealing and it is believed the money from the drugs was to fund the escape. Prison break: Guards at Gartree foiled the daring plan after a tip-off . 'Word is they were getting outsiders to fly a chopper into the yard.' The only successful helicopter escape in Britain happened at Gartree when murderer Sydney Draper and robber John Kendall fled by air. They were later recaptured. In March 2009, a plot to free nine Muslim terrorists from Full Sutton using a hijacked helicopter was foiled. Al-Qaida henchmen on the outside planned to hire the chopper, then force the pilot to land at gunpoint.","Hired killer Wayne Collins and gang leader Mark Osborne hatched escape plan from Gartree Prison, Leics .

President Obama last night gave the clearest sign yet that the federal government has no intention of challenging those states which voted to legalize the recreational use and sale of marijuana. Speaking to ABC News' Barbara Walters, the President said that the prosecution of recreational marijuana users in states that have legalized the substance won't be a ‘top priority’ for federal law enforcement officials in the war on drugs. ‘We've got bigger fish to fry,' said the President, who was speaking about cannabis for the first time since Colorado and Washington voted to legalize it. Speaking to ABC News' Barbara Walters, President Obama has given the clearest signal yet that federal government has no intention of challenging those states which voted to legalize marijuana . The President was interviewed by Barbara Walters as one of her most fascinating people of 2012 . ‘It would not make sense for us to see a . top priority as going after recreational users in states that have . determined that it's legal,’ he told Walters in a 20/20 interview which airs Friday night. Although the sale and use of marijuana is in defiance of federal law, the president's comments are the strongest suggestion yet that he plans to adopt a 'hands-off' approach, similar to that taken toward users of medicinal marijuana in the 18 states where it is legal. Marijuana remains classified under the Controlled Substances Act as a Schedule I narcotic whose cultivation, distribution, possession and use are criminal acts. It is in the same category as heroin, LSD and Ecstasy all deemed to have high potential for abuse. Obama told Walters he does not - ‘at this point’ – support the widespread legalization of marijuana. But he cited shifting public opinion and limited government resources as reasons to find a middle ground on punishing use of the drug. ‘This is a tough problem, because Congress has not yet changed the law,’ Obama said. 'I head up the executive branch; we're supposed to be carrying out laws. And so what we're going to need to have is a conversation about, How do you reconcile a federal law that still says marijuana is a federal offense and state laws that say that it's legal?' Attorney General Eric Holder and the Justice Department have been asked by the president to examine the legal questions surrounding conflicting state and federal laws on drugs. 'There are a number of issues that have to be considered, among them the impact that drug usage has on young people, [and] we have treaty obligations with nations outside the United States,' said Holder on Wednesday. School daze: As a young man, the President was an avid pot user and in this photograph from his yearbook he thanks his friends in the Choom Gang - slang for smoking pot - and Ray, his drug dealer . A marijuana rally in Denver, Colorado, the state voted in November to permit the possession of up to an ounce of marijuana for those 21 and older . As a politician, Obama has always opposed legalizing marijuana and downplayed his personal history with the substance. Obama wrote in his 1995 memoir, ‘Dreams from My Father,’ that he would smoke pot regularly with his high school buddies who formed the ‘Choom Gang’ - slang for smoking marijuana. Further details about the president's dope-smoking days as a high school student in the 1970s were revealed by biographer David Maraniss in his book, Barack Obama: The Story, published in June. Called Barry by his friends, the future president 'was known for starting a few pot-smoking trends', including one called 'total absorption.' The rules of TA stated that if you exhaled early, 'you were assessed a penalty and your turn was skipped the next time the joint came around'. 'Wasting good bud smoke was not tolerated,' an old school friend told the author. And if that rule didn't give enough of an insight into how much Obama loved his marijuana, Maraniss goes on to reveal he was known for his 'interceptions' when a joint was being passed around. President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama held a Hanukkah reception in the Grand Foyer of the White House on Thursday evening . 'He often elbowed his way in, out of turn, shouted ""intercepted"", and took an extra hit,' he writes.The anecdotes are from Obama's time studying at Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii and Occidental College in Los Angeles. ‘There are a bunch of things I did that I regret when I was a kid,’ Obama told Walters. ‘My attitude is, substance abuse generally is not good for our kids, not good for our society. ‘I want to discourage drug use,’ he added. Colorado and Washington are the first states to legalize recreational use of marijuana. In both states, pot use remains illegal . in public. Eighteen states have approved the use of marijuana for . medicinal use with a doctor's order. Federal law still prohibits all use . and sale of marijuana. Barbara Walters' exclusive first joint, post-election interview with President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama airs Friday night on 20/20 at 10 p.m. ET on ABC.","The prosecution of cannabis users won't be a 'top priority', he told Barbara Walters .

A school cafeteria worker in Missouri lost her job after giving away free food to a student in need. Dianne Brame, 60, had been sneaking hot meals to fourth grader who always came without money to lunch at Hudson Elementary in Webster Groves, St Louis County. The boy had previously been on the free lunch program but Brame believes his parents didn't understand how to reapply for the new school year. Popular: Dianne Brame continues to be a popular member of staff . When Brame's employers found out that she had been giving out food against regulations she lost the job she had loved for the past two years. Brame told Fox2now how much she enjoyed her work: 'I knew kids by their names, I knew their likes and dislikes, so it was just fun.' When she noticed the one boy always had the standard plain cheese sandwich, which is given to children with no lunch money, Brame began to worry. 'Kids can be cruel to see this kid eating cheese sandwiches day after day after day. [They said] ""You don’t have any money in your account, that’s why you have to eat cheese sandwiches."" And my heart just couldn’t tolerate that, so I broke the rule.' she told Kmov. The lunch lady proudly shows off the apron she used for two years . So Brame began bending regulations to feed . the boy hot meals. But this was dimly viewed by her employers, . Chartwell’s School Dining Services. Brame explained: 'I let his account get over $45 which I’m only supposed to let it get over $10, and I started letting him come through my lunch line without putting his number in, and they look at that as stealing. I thought it was just taking care of a kid.' Her supervisor gave Brame a stark choice - to take a demotion at another school or lose her job. As she explains, she could only take a job within walking distance so told her supervisor to sack her. 'My husband died in February, I lost my home, car got repo’ed,' Brame told Fox, 'Hudson is in walking distance from me, so I took the firing. Fire me.' When this story was first reported Brame said she wouldn't have changed a thing about her dismissal. But following a huge response from the local community, on Friday Brame was reinstated to her job. Higher-grade Chartwells' employees overruled Brame's supervisor and the company has described the incident as 'an unfortunate misunderstanding.' A statement said: 'Chartwells is pleased to have resolved this misunderstanding together with the employee and she will be at work, as usual, this coming week.' With news of Brame's rehiring, her son wrote an emotional tribute on Fox2now, claiming: 'What she was doing at the school for that little boy did not surprise me at all. It is who she is. 'A strong, beautiful, and compassionate woman. When my brother and I asked her about lawsuits and tightening the screws on her employer in typical Mom fashion she said no but I would like to have my job back because even though I broke the rules I did not do anything wrong.' Back to work: Brame has been reinstated and will return to the school on Monday .","Diane Brame, 60, of St Louis County, sneaked hot food to a boy who never came with lunch money .

There are certain unmitigated facts – that a gunman entered Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday morning, and that as a direct consequence, 27 people in the small town of Newtown, Connecticut are dead. But as the investigation into the shooting goes on, many aspects of it remain complex. Perhaps the biggest question lingering on people’s minds across the nation is why the shooting happened – something that may never be answered in a satisfactory manner. Scroll down for video . Two days after the shooting that claimed 27 lives, the investigation remains complicated as a nation demands answers . Mourners react at a makeshift memorial near the school following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 15 . One of the biggest questions remains what connection shooter Adam Lanza had with Sandy Hook Elementary School, and if his mother, Nancy Lanza even taught there. It was initially reported that she was a substitute kindergarten teacher there. ‘No one has heard of her,’ former board member Lillian Bittman told the Wall Street Journal. ‘Teachers don’t know her.’ However, the AP is still reporting that Mrs Lanza was a substitute teacher. It is also unclear what, if any, ties Adam Lanza had with the elementary school . Chief Medical Examiner Dr. H. Wayne Carver was asked if the victims – including 20 children - suffered. 'If so,' he said, 'not for very long.' The terrible details about the last moments of young innocents emerged as authorities released their names and ages — the youngest 6 and 7, the oldest 56. They included Ana Marquez-Greene, a little girl who had just moved to Newtown from Canada; Victoria Soto, a 27-year-old teacher who apparently died while trying to hide her pupils; and principal Dawn Hochsprung, who authorities said lunged at the gunman in an attempt to overtake him and paid with her life. The tragedy has plunged Newtown into mourning and added the picturesque New England community of handsome Colonial homes, red-brick sidewalks and 27,000 people to the grim map of towns where mass shootings in recent years have periodically reignited the national debate over gun control but led to little change. A Connecticut state police man fights back tears on Saturday . A handwritten sign reads 'Pray for Newtown' following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School . Faced with the unimaginable, townspeople sadly took down some of their Christmas decorations and struggled Saturday with how to go on. Signs around town read, 'Hug a teacher today,' ''Please pray for Newtown' and 'Love will get us through.' As the ‘TODAY’ show notes, information remains confusing and at times, contradictory. It was first reported that the gunman was buzzed in by Principal Hochsprung, but authorities later said that he forced himself in. Police shed no light on what triggered Adam Lanza, 20, to carry out the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, though state police Lt. Paul Vance said investigators had found ""very good evidence ... that our investigators will be able to use in painting the complete picture, the how and, more importantly, the why."" He would not elaborate. However, another law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said investigators have found no note or manifesto from Lanza of the sort they have come to expect after murderous rampages such as the Virginia Tech bloodbath in 2007 that left 33 people dead. Amid the confusion and sorrow, stories of heroism emerged, including an account of Hochsprung, 47, and the school psychologist, Mary Sherlach, 56, rushing toward Lanza in an attempt to stop him.  Both died. There was also 27-year-old teacher Victoria Soto, whose name has been invoked as a portrait of selflessness and humanity among unfathomable evil. Mourners gather for a candlelight vigil outside the Edmond Town Hall in Newtown . Investigators told relatives she was killed while shielding her first-graders from danger. She reportedly hid some students in a bathroom or closet, ensuring they were safe, a cousin, Jim Wiltsie, told ABC News. 'She put those children first. That's all she ever talked about,' a friend, Andrea Crowell, told The Associated Press. 'She wanted to do her best for them, to teach them something new every day.' There was also 6-year-old Emilie Parker, whose grieving father, Robbie, talked to reporters not long after police released the names of the victims but expressed no animosity, offering sympathy for Lanza's family. 'I can't imagine how hard this experience must be for you,' he said.

It surely wasn’t what she – or the publisher who stumped up a £400,000 advance – expected. But Pippa Middleton’s party-planning book has struggled to sell after attracting an avalanche of unkind reviews blasting its advice as ‘glaringly obvious’. If she is disheartened, however, ‘Her Royal Hotness’ isn’t showing it – and has even launched a tireless book-signing blitzkrieg in an attempt to turn things around. Recipe for success: Pippa signs one of many cut-price copies of Celebrate . Her work ethic is hard to fault: Amsterdam one day, Berkshire the next – and that’s where we witnessed her irresistible, full-on charm offensive first-hand. Whether the well-heeled villagers of Stanford Dingley need to be taught how to pass the parcel, play conkers or sit on a hay bale is, of course, a moot point. But the Duchess of Cambridge’s 29-year-old sister clearly believes they do as she hustles for sales in her charming local pub, The Bull, two miles from the family’s £4.85 million seven-bedroom manor house. And as £20 copies of Celebrate fly out of the door, who can argue with her? She is a trouper, standing behind the bar for almost four hours, signing for the faithful as she sups stoically on a pint of iced water. ‘A whole five pounds off,’ she tells me winningly, leaping through the hatch to pose for a picture. ‘And signed, too.’ Indeed. The woman next in line buys six signed copies, then hurries for the door. ‘Right,’ she says gleefully, to no one in particular. ‘These babies are going straight on eBay for £40.’ Discounted: Pippa presented a signed copy to Mail on Sunday reporter Adam Lee-Potter . Her dour partner replies: ‘I don’t know if it’s worth it, love. They’re going for £4 a time in Sainsbury’s.’ The book is, like its author, pretty, slight but engaging. Both mean well. ‘How is your sister?’ I ask, enquiring after Kate’s acute morning sickness. ‘Oh, she’s doing much better, thank you,’ she says. How are books sales going? ‘Oh, tolerable, you know.’ Pippa obligingly nestles beside me, a petite hand in the small of my back. She is, frankly, impossible to dislike, and – next to Simon Cowell – the most flirtatious person I have ever met. Flicking her hair like a show pony, she could flirt with a brick wall. ‘Isn’t this fun?’ she gushes. ‘I adore this pub. Everyone has been so kind. Would you like a pheasant goujon? It’s my own recipe.’ Was writing the book hard work? ‘Awfully,’ says Pippa. ‘But so worth it. I love being an author. And I love parties. This was my dream job.’ The Middletons are clearly at home here. This is, after all, where Pippa learnt to cook, working in the kitchen during her gap year as a ‘ciabatta roll maker’. Pippa’s parents – who ARE bestsellers, with their Party Pieces business worth £30 million – have come out to support the cause. Dad Michael, 63, guards the bar, stolidly drinking red wine. Mum Carole, 55, works the room like a pro, matching her husband glass for glass. Carole spots me, standing alone, and barrels over chummily, tottering slightly on expensive heels. ‘I’ve been having hot flushes,’ she says, randomly. ‘Are you local?’ ‘No,’ I tell her. ‘I’m from Dorset.’ Celebration: Pippa Middleton, left, pictured at the launch of her book Celebrate, right, in October . This doesn’t go down at all well. ‘Ah,’ she says. ‘I must go and talk to a friend of mine over there.’ She wanders over to the corner of the bar to pet a spaniel puppy. Staff come round proffering canapes inspired by the book –  Pippa’s pheasant goujons and what look like Ritz crackers smeared with cream cheese – but both are largely ignored. Pippa is the star attraction. The other hit – apart from Pippa’s celebrated derriere, encased tonight in a green frock that sits slightly oddly with her Eton collar – is the ‘Pippa’s Cocktails’ list. Support: Pippa's parents Carole and Michael Middleton were at the book signing . As a handsome woman of a certain age tells me, petting her labradoodle: ‘The Horse’s Neck is especially good. The book’s worth it for that recipe alone.’ She has a point. It is undeniably moreish: brandy, ginger beer, lime juice and Angostura bitters. Moreover, at £5, it’s possibly the cheapest thing on the menu. Pippa is a game old sort and doesn’t take herself too seriously, happy to highlight a parody Twitter account called @pippatips that offers such advice as: ‘Enjoy a glass of water by getting a clean glass and pouring in water from a tap or bottle.’ But she is at pains to point out that any guide has to cover the basics, writing in The Spectator: ‘If I were to write a cookery book, I would be compelled to say that, to make an omelette, you have to break at least one egg. Actually, that’s not a bad idea. Or maybe I should write a sequel and call it Bottoms Up? Now that could be a bestseller.’ She also revealed that her father has a penchant for festive fancy dress: ‘A couple of Christmases ago he appeared in an inflatable sumo outfit.’ But here he opts for herringbone jacket, navy slacks and tan shoes. The locals – all dressed identically, the men at least – mob him and his wife. The Middletons are the rock stars of Stanford Dingley. The book signings finally dry up. Pippa stands at the bar – still beaming like a professional ice-skater – until all the Middletons head off home. In their wake, the pub  empties like a bathtub.

A Post Office in the tiny Welsh village of BETHLEHEM has been swamped with customers who want to have their Christmas cards stamped with its unique postmark. Thousands of visitors from all over the world will be flocking to the village for their Christmas mail to be stamped with the festive name. Postmaster Mike Williams said: 'This is a very busy time for our Bethlehem branch. Swamped: Bethlehem Post Office in a tiny village in Carmathanshire West Wales has been inundated with visitors who want their Christmas cards sent with its unique stamp . Left, the coveted Bethlehem stamp with the angel and the harp, and right, post office worker Pauline Bewley, who is coping with thousands of tourist customers . 'People come from all over the UK and abroad to hand deliver their cards to make sure they get the Bethlehem handstamp. 'We have had visitors from as far as America, Australia and even from the more famous Bethlehem.' The unique stamp shows an angel and a harp, with greetings in English and Welsh. And crucially it carries the name of the Biblical city in Palestine fabled as the birthplace of Jesus. The post office in the quiet Carmarthenshire village is more than 2,500 miles from the 'Little Town of Bethlehem' featured in the popular Christmas carol. But that hasn't stopped customers rushing there - and mail chiefs expect around 30,000 letters to pass through the post office this year. Royal Mail Director Tony Fox, said: 'Thousands of our customers take advantage of this unique handstamp helping bring festive cheer to those who receive it at Christmas.'

Tourist destination: Thousands of people flock to Bethlehem every year because of its famous name . Traveller: The Prince of Wales in 1862 . Photographs and previously unseen diary extracts charting a royal visit to Bethlehem 150 years ago are to go on display. Queen Victoria's eldest son King Edward VII travelled on an educational trip to the Middle East in 1862 when he was the Prince of Wales. He was joined by Francis Bedford - the first photographer to accompany a royal tour. Bedford's images of the trip captured a view of Bethlehem from the roof of the Church of the Nativity, said to be built on the spot where Jesus was born. He also took a picture of the Shepherds' Field showing the area where the Angel Gabriel is said to have appeared to the shepherds. The photographs, which belong to the Royal Collection, will form part of a new exhibition - Cairo to Constantinople: Early Photographs of the Middle East - at The Queen's Gallery, Palace of Holyroodhouse, from March 8, 2013. Curator Sophie Gordon said the purpose of taking the photograph from the Church of the Nativity was to show the Victorian audience that Bethlehem really existed and to add weight to the Christian tradition. 'Bethlehem wasn't directly on the Prince's route - and so his party made a particular point of going there,' she said. Dr Gordon added: 'Very little was known about this part of the world at the time, and what information they did have was largely based on knowledge of the Bible.' In the early 1860s, photography was still in its infancy and had only been introduced to the public in 1839. 'Bedford's camera would have been quite large to accommodate a 10 x 12in glass plate negative,' Dr Gordon added. 'He must have had porters to carry all his equipment, as the entire photographic process had to be done on the spot. Exhibition: The Shepherds' Field, Bethlehem, taken on a royal visit . to Bethlehem in 1862 . 'Just before he took the photograph, Bedford would have coated and sensitised the plate, because the plate had to go in the camera when it was still wet. 'He would have then developed and fixed the image, while excluding all light, and washed the plate. 'To carry out this process, Bedford would have constructed a temporary dark room, perhaps on the church roof.' The then Prince of Wales described the party's visit to Bethlehem in his diary entry for April 3, 1862, describing how 'our tents were struck at 8.30am and we started at that time (on horseback of course) for Bethlehem, which we reached in about a couple of hours time, stopping on the way at Rachel's tomb, and it was ascertained for certain that the tomb is on the site of the real one'. Unseen: Royal photographer Francis Bedford took this picture of Bethlehem 150 years ago while on a visit with the Prince of Wales . He recalls how they had 'some splendid refreshment' and how they saw a 'fine view' on the top of the church. On April 18, 1862, when the party encountered poor weather ahead of a ride to Nazareth, he wrote: 'Early in the morning it blew a regular hurricane and poured with rain and all our tents were in gt. jeopardy.' The heir to the throne's four-month trip to the Middle East was designed to increase his understanding of the area at a time when the Ottoman Empire was disintegrating and Britain needed to secure the route to India. Cairo to Constantinople: Early Photographs of the Middle East will go on show at the Queen's Gallery, Palace of Holyroodhouse, from March 8 to July 21, and at the Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace, from October 2014 to February 2015.","Thousands flock to village with the famous name of Bethlehem .

You'd be forgiven for thinking a steaming hot toddy is the best remedy for a cold, but according to new research it's lager you should be knocking back to beat the dreaded lurgy. A new Japanese study suggests that a key ingredient found in beer may help to warn off the winter sniffles. Researchers at Sapporo Medical University found that humulone, a chemical compound in hops, was effective against the respiratory syncytial (RS) virus and was found to have an anti-inflammatory effect. Can drinking beer really keep a winter cold at bay? Jun Fuchimoto, a researcher from the beer company, said: 'The RS virus can cause serious pneumonia and breathing difficulties for . infants and toddlers, but no vaccination is available at the moment to . contain it.' Particularly common during cold winter months, the RS virus can also cause symptoms similar to that of the common cold in adults. Beer contains natural antioxidants and vitamins that can help prevent heart disease and rebuild muscle. Darker  beers contain more antioxidants, which help reverse cellular damage that occurs in the body. Hops contain polyphenols, which can help lower cholesterol, fight cancer and kill viruses. Sapporo Breweries now hopes to . create humulone-containing food and (non-alcoholic) beverages that both . adults and children can consume. It's not the first time that the health benefits of beer have been touted. In November, Alexis Nasard, chief commercial officer of Heineken, announced that beer was not only natural but 'healthy'. In an interview with CNBC, he added that beer has fewer calories than a lot of things, including a glass of milk.Previous research has suggested that drinking beer may help build better bones thanks to its high silicon content. The mineral is important for the growth . and development of bone and connective tissue and helping reduce the . risk of the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis. Sniffles: Many Britons suffer from an annual winter cold . But before you reach for a cold one, while experts agree that beer may be beneficial for some people when consumed in moderation, guzzling too much beer - or indeed alcohol - can result in weight gain, dehydration and a plethora of other physical and social hazards. And since only small quantities of . humulone can be found in beer, researchers say you would have to . drink about 30 12 oz. cans of it to benefit from the . anti-virus effect. However another leading beer expert, Professor Ramon Etruch of the University Hospital in Barcelona, has previously said that only a single unit’s worth of beer is required to obtain some of the beneficial health effects.","Humulone, the bitter-tasting chemical compound found in hops, is said to be effective against cold and flu virus .

Hate preacher Abu Qatada, who has just moved into a new £450,000 taxpayer-funded home, has received more than £500,000 in legal aid. The vast bill for funding the Al Qaeda fanatic’s decade-long legal battle against the British government was last night described as ‘sickening’ by a campaign group. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the payment of such large sums dented public confidence in the legal system. Scroll down for video . Qatada has received more than £500,000 in legal aid funding, it has emerged . It came amid complaints from Qatada’s . new landlady that she had been unaware of the identity of her tenant . when she agreed to let out her north London property, which is close to a . church. The property, let through an agency, . costs £1,400 a month – paid for by state handouts. Qatada moved in last . week after complaining his previous house, in north-west London, was not . big enough for his wife and four of his five children. The owner of the . new property said: ‘I had no idea who was living there. I have read . about this man and why he was in prison, he does not seem like a nice . character. We signed a contract with the company for six months but . there is no way I would have given my permission to rent the house to a . man like that – not ever.’ Sprialling cost: Theresa May has vowed to continue to deport Qatada, pictured outside his home in November after being released on bail . Abu Qatada's new home in north London . Qatada, once described as Osama bin . Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, is fighting attempts to deport him to . his native Jordan where he is wanted on charges of terrorism. His . removal is being blocked under human rights law amid concerns some of . the evidence which may be used against him could have been obtained by . torture. He was freed from jail on strict bail . conditions last month, pending an appeal by the Home Secretary. Previous . estimates had placed his legal aid bill at less than £400,000. But, in a . written Parliamentary answer, the Ministry of Justice revealed that, as . of December 5, the department had provided £515,778 in legal aid . funding to the cleric. Ministers confirmed the total cost . will be higher, warning: ‘The legal services commission has not received . final claims from Abu Qatada’s solicitors.’ Mr Grayling said: ‘We must . never lose sight of the fact that legal aid is paid for by the taxpayer. ‘The total costs in some cases seem very high, and many – myself included – will question whether they provide value for money.’ Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Legal aid is there to ensure everyone has equal access . to justice, but it is sickening to see the extent to which this vile . hate preacher has been taking advantage of it.’ The total public bill for Qatada is . estimated to have now reached £3million. Keeping him in a maximum . security prison for more than eight years has cost the taxpayer an . estimated £850,000. The Home Office has confirmed its own . legal bill for trying to deport him has so far totalled £825,000. Qatada’s home is monitored round-the clock by security staff at a cost . of £100,000 a week. In 2009 the House of Lords ruled it . was safe to deport Qatada, but earlier this year the European Court of . Human Rights said he would not receive a fair trial. That verdict has . since been upheld by British immigration judges. A satellite dish is removed from the hate preacher's old home . Removal men were seen outside the radical cleric's north-West London home, loading possessions, including a large satellite dish and what looked like a personal cross-trainer, into a van . A panel set up by David Cameron to end abuse of human rights law is tomorrow expected to produce a ‘disappointing and vague’ report of little use to ministers. The Commission on a Bill of Rights is said to be deeply split. It contains senior Labour and Lib Dem figures who are resistant to any serious reform of the last government’s Human Rights Act.Some members are understood to be pushing for even more human rights to be enshrined in legislation. The Prime Minister had originally pledged to scrap the Act and replace it with a Bill of Rights, which would stop the system being a charter for criminals and those who refused to work. But, after being forced into a coalition with the Lib Dems, he had to downgrade his pledge. Instead, he established the commission to decide the best way forward. Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, who quit the panel in protest over its lack of direction, warned of the likelihood of an underwhelming final product. The academic said: ‘Several of my former colleagues on the commission have warned me not to hold my breath and to expect a disappointing and vague report.‘If the commission makes a majority recommendation – as seems likely – that there should in principle be a new British Bill of Rights, the report may do little more than set out alternative options as to the contents.’","Cost of Qatada's legal bill 'still rises' as he continues to fight deportation .

Trains were supposed to be running as normal from 6am today, but further problems were found, causing yet more misery for unhappy commuters. Long wait: Rail passengers were left stranded at the London train station for hours following problems with overhead wires . The electrical problems were identified on two lines through Hitchin, Hertfordshire yesterday and trains between Stevenage and Letchworth garden City (for Cambridge) were cancelled. The problem is affecting passengers with . four train companies - East Coast, First Capital Connect, First Hull . Trains and Grand Central. A reduced service is now running between Kings Cross and Peterborough but with delays of up to half an hour, following three-hour waits this morning. Replacement buses will be in place between Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City until the end of the day, but the line between Welwyn and Biggleswade has reopened.

First Hull Trains passengers may use East Coast trains between London and Doncaster. Grand Central passengers may use .

It said 14 'droppers', which are part of the overhead wires, were found to be broken and contact wires damaged, causing damage to trains. Rail bosses urged passengers heading away for the great Christmas getaway to stay in the capital for the time being, if possible. An East Coast train company spokesman said: 'We apologise to passengers for the continued disruption to our services this morning. 'Earlier this morning, another train operator's service joining the main line at Hitchin was involved in an incident which led to reports of new overhead power line damage, following damage yesterday afternoon.' A spokesman for National Rail told Mail Online today: 'We first became aware of the problem just after 2.30pm yesterday.

'Engineers have been there since 3pm yesterday, and are still there trying to fix the damaged cable. 'Between 1am and 6.30am, crews were replacing the damaged wires. Unfortunately, sometimes with these these problems, you only find out the extent of the damage when run a train through it, and we've discovered there is a lot more damage. 'Normal service will not resume until later this morning, and customers are advised to check with their operator for details. 'We do apologise for the continued delays and we are working to fix the problem.' Elsewhere on the railways today, a broken-down train at Dumfries in southern Scotland meant buses had to replace trains between Carlisle in Cumbria and Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. In the Manchester area, a signalling problem near Guide Bridge led to delays for passengers travelling between Romiley/Dinting and Guide Bridge on Northern Rail services, with limited replacement buses operating. On the Tube, there were delays on the Northern line between Camden Town and High Barnet/Mill Hill East due to a signal failure at East Finchley. The Hertfordshire overhead wire problem is the latest, and one of the worst, incidents which have plagued passengers in recent weeks. After a comparatively trouble-free early autumn, rail services have been hit by numerous rush-hour problems as the darker days and colder weather arrived. The next nightmare for passengers will be average season ticket rises of 4.2 per cent on January 2.","Broken overhead wires in Hertfordshire cause huge problems for trains .

Landlord Alan Law, 46, and his wife Sue, 42, said they could not believe their eyes when the black and white critter casually strolled around their beer garden - feasting on a leftover carvery. The raccoon has been spotted by locals at the Holt Fleet pub and restaurant in Worcester - who have nicknamed him 'Bandit'. Landord Alan and Sue Law could not believe their eyes when this black and white critter casually strolled around their pub beer garden, and was found feasting on leftover carvery . The picturesque pub is set in 15 acres of woodland, where the raccoon is believed to be hiding out . Mother of two Sue said: 'It is very bizarre. They're not even found in this country so we don't know where it could have come from. Alan and Sue Law believe the raccoon is probably an escaped pet . 'It could be someone's pet or has escaped from somewhere - it's a mystery. It's behaviour is just like a cat - it just sat and looked at us. 'He seems to like the pub, the smells from the kitchen probably entice him into the garden.' Bandit was first spotted by chef Richard Smith eating by food skips at the back of the pub and restaurant on Friday, December 4. Fellow workers laughed off his claims, dismissing it as a fox until barman James Stanley, 20, captured a picture of the creature on his mobile phone. There has since been additional sightings of the mammal, which is believed to live in woodland behind the pub. A spokesman for the RSPCA said raccoon's were not native to the UK and it was illegal to release them here. She said: 'At the moment there have been sightings of the Raccoon but we don't know where it is to rescue it. 'It may be a case of setting a safe humane trap so we can catch it.  It is likely that this Raccoon could be an escaped or abandoned pet.' Raccoons are easily identified by its black mask like colouring around its eyes. It is also endowed with unusually long toes, which are often mistaken as fingers. They originated in North America and were later introduced to other countries such as Japan.  The animal is mainly found in forests, marshes, prairies, but they also known to venture in to cities and make homes in the attics of houses. The raccoon's main predators are the fox and dog. It is also killed by humans and its fur is used for clothing including coats and hats.","The critter was found in Worcester - 4,000 miles away from native home in North America .

Violent death: Leah Whittle, 42, was stabbed to death at her house by her teenage son Kieren Smith. He will be sentenced tomorrow . A 17-year-old youth has been found guilty of the murder of his mother who he stabbed to death after losing his temper. Kieren Smith killed 42-year-old Leah Whittle at her home in Benville Road, Weymouth, Dorset, on July 21. A jury found him guilty of murder at Winchester Crown Court today following an eight-day trial. Smith is due to be sentenced at the same court tomorrow. Smith inflicted knife wounds across her head, back and front in the two bedroom flat they shared, jurors were told. The teenager, who has ‘an interest in knives’, fled the flat in the early hours, climbing out of his first floor bedroom window and down a drainpipe. Following the conviction, Detective Inspector Marcus Hester, of Dorset Police, said: 'This case involved a particularly horrific and sustained attack on a woman who was unable to defend herself. 'This is a very tragic case where a young man, through his own violent actions, has killed his mother. He now has to face the consequences of these actions as well as to live with the loss of his mother.' The trial heard that Smith repeatedly attacked his mother in the flat they shared. Richard Smith QC, prosecuting, told the jury that the defendant, who was 16 at the time, had an interest in knives and had a temper but he said the reason for the alleged murder would never be known. Smith had denied the killing and said that men came down from Doncaster in Yorkshire to execute his mother because his brother had got into trouble over a drug debt. He told friends and the police that he had seen the man or men attack his mother through a bathroom door and when they had left he had bolted the door, taken some money from his mother’s purse and escaped through a window and down a drainpipe. Mr Smith told the jury that the defendant had spoken to a girlfriend in the hours before his mother was murdered to say she only had a couple of days to live because of the problems over the drug debt. But Mr Smith alleged that this was just 'setting a scene for some sort of attack on his mother' and that the teenager had either formed a murderous intent or the bravado of the conversation had spurred him on to commit murder because he was 'brooding' over something that had happened between them. Smith told friends of his 'escape' when he met up with them shortly before 3am, but they did not call the police or an ambulance. In an earlier phone call, at around 10pm that evening, Smith had told a . female friend in that group his mum would be executed and had 'days to . live'. Experts believe Ms Whittle was 'immobilised' early on in a horrific killing at her own son’s hands. A blade wielded by Smith severed her spinal cord, a post mortem of her bloodstained body revealed. 'Interest in knives': Winchester Crown Court heard the teenager turned on his mother, stabbing her in the head, back and front and then blaming mystery men from Yorkshire . There were no injuries on her arms or . hands, suggesting she was rendered unconscious early in the attack. Smith then took money from his mother’s handbag, changed his trousers . and left through the window. He told his three friends - all girls - that cuts on his hands were from scaling down the drainpipe. But forensics experts found traces of his blood inside the flat. Giving evidence, the girls recalled . Smith’s socks had been soaked in blood, and that despite the . events their old school friend had acted as if nothing had happened. Smith rang police to report his . mother’s murder the next day, but turned his phone off and took the . battery and SIM card out after giving the address. The murder weapons have never been recovered. Smith - who could not be named for . legal reasons before his conviction today - said he threw the knife the . gang used into bushes as he fled. Unemployed Ms Whittle had moved back to Dorset after living in Yorkshire until her marriage had broken down. The . court heard that her relationship with her son was often less than . harmonious but the teenager told police the pair were close.","Kieren Smith turned on Leah Whittle, stabbing her with at least one knife .

The man behind a fundraising dinner where Mitt Romney was secretly filmed disparaging President Obama's supporters as welfare dependents - has reportedly planned another event in support of his presidential campaign. The Republican leader was criticised after a recording of him saying that 47 per cent of voters planning to back President Obama believed they were 'entitled' to government support and considered themselves 'victims,' was posted online. Businessman Marc Leder, who hosted the fundraiser where the comments were made in May, is reported to have said he has organised another event in Florida this Saturday out of an apparent sense of obligation to Mr Romney following the fall-out from the secret film. Plan: Marc Leder hosted the $50,000-a-plate fundraiser where Mr Romney made his much-criticised remarks in May. He has reportedly helped organise another fundraiser for the Republican campaign this Saturday . A separate . fundraiser for the Romney Campaign, also co-hosted by Mr Leder is believed to be planned for Friday night in Boca . Raton, Florida, according to reports. In the secret recording from the May event, which was leaked on the left-leaning Mother Jones website, Mr Romney said 47 percent of the people who . will vote for the president 'are dependent upon government.' He said they 'believe that, that they . are victims, who believe that government has the responsibility to care . for them' and 'that they are entitled to health care, to food, . to housing.' Mr Romney said the people he referred to would vote for the president 'no matter what' and that he would not worry about them because he would 'never convince them they should take . personal responsibility and care for their lives.' James Carter, grandson of former . Democratic president Jimmy Carter, put reporters from Mother Jones in . touch with an unnamed individual . who had shot the secret footage. Scroll down to watch the video . Mission: The video was posted online by the Mother Jones website with the help of James Carter (pictured) grandson of former president Jimmy Carter . Comments: Mr Romney (seen here during the town hall debate with President Obama at Hofstra University in New York, on Tuesday) has since retracted the remarks . Leaked: Mother Jones, a liberal news magazine, says it obtained the footage from an anonymous person who attended the fundraiser . Bona fide: The Romney campaign did not dispute the authenticity of the video . Mr Romney's comments were used by his critics to dismiss him as 'out of touch.' The Republican leader has since retracted the comments saying they were 'just completely . wrong.' His campaign team is believed to have tightened rules on the recording of fundraising events following the leak. Mr Leder, who is reported to be a . leveraged buy-out specialist, has been telling potential donors that he . wants to 'make the situation right' by raising more funds for the Romney . campaign, according to the Huffington Post. Facts: Romney has statistics on his side when it comes to the 47 percent comment -- only 53 percent of Americans pay federal income tax after deductions and rebates . The Post quoted one donor saying that Mr Leder had been 'taking heat' following the fundraiser. Unlike the last event, which was . hosted by Mr Leder at his home, Saturday's dinner is reportedly being . held at a venue in Palm Beach, Florida. Mr Leder - who is the co-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers - has an increasing public profile.

The Indiana man who was arrested for threatening to 'go on a rampage' at a local school and was found to have 47 guns in his home entered a not guilty plea in court today. The wife of Von Meyer, 60, called police after he said he would stab her with a screwdriver, kill her children and grandchildren, and launch a shooting spree at the school where she works as part of the cafeteria staff. Meyer's threats on Friday came just hours before a 20-year-old man opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School halfway across the country in Connecticut. Arrested: Von Meyer, 60, was arrested after threatening to kill people at a nearby elementary school . Meyer's wife, who has not been . publicly named, got in an altercation with her husband on Friday morning . when he threatened to gouge her eyes out, stab her with the . construction tool, and light her on fire when she was sleeping. He also threatened his wife's . children and grand children before turning his attention to the children . of Jane Ball Elementary School. The couple's home is less than 500 . feet from the school, and Meyer was undoubtedly familiar with the . facility because his wife works there. The police report states that the . school is easily accessed from Meyer's home by a series of trails and . paths that cut through a wooded area. Officials at Jane Ball School were notified, and they immediately took unspecified security measures. The same happened at all local schools on . Friday because of the threat, which was undoubtedly heightened as news . rolled in of the shooting in Connecticut. Wooded area: Meyer lives in a home that is less than 1,000 feet away from an elementary school . Dangerously close: Meyer's house is extremely close to an elementary school, making his comments more threatening . He claimed that he was going to 'kill . as many people as he could before police could stop him', and once they . showed up at the couple's Ceder Lake home, it was clear that he would . have been able to carry through with that threat. When police arrived at Meyer's home, . they found 47 guns- many of which would have fit in a historical . collection- and ammunition, the sum of which cost more than $100,000. 'Through investigation, police . learned that Meyer reportedly had a large number of weapons hidden . throughout the two story historical home,' the report states. Police arrested Meyer and he now . faces four counts of felony intimidation, two counts of resisting law . enforcement, and one count of domestic battery. Bond has been set at $100,000 and he is going to be represented by a public defender. That said, police chief Jerry Smill . told the Associated Press that he believes that the threat against the . school was not serious. Meyer's wife said in the probable . cause affidavit that it was not the first time that her husband had . threatened her, and that they had a 'turbulent' relationship. Meyer was known to be a member of the Invaders Motorcycle Gang, though his role in the group was unclear. Like . the notorious Hells Angels, the Invaders Motorcycle Gang is also . considered an outlaw group.

Gangsters who plotted to murder Justin Bieber and castrate him with a pair of garden shears were offered a bounty of $2,500 for each of the teen heart-throb's testicles, it has been claimed. Jailed Dana Martin, who has a tattoo of the star on his leg, is accused of offering the reward after recruiting two men to kidnap the singer along with his body guard and two other victims. According to police Martin hatched the grisly plot because he felt Bieber had snubbed his efforts to contact him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Target: Two men who planned to kill and castrate Justin Bieber after . his November 28 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York (pictured) were offered $2,500 for each of the singer's testicles it has been claimed . Plot: Dana Martin (left) is said to be obsessed with the pop singer, and has a tattoo of Bieber on his leg; he recruited Mark Staake (right) to carry out the plot . He allegedly ordered his accomplices to first . strangle the victims with a paisley tie as it was his 'calling card' which he had used in previous attacks. Martin met Mark Staake, a fellow . inmate at Las Cruces state prison in New Mexico years ago. While there, . Staake agreed to enlist his own nephew in order to carry out the . murderous plot. Tooled up: One of the gang was picked up in possession of pair of garden shears he allegedly planned to use to carry out the castration . Staake and Ruane were alledly poised . to strike while the Canadian singer was in New York for a performance at . Madison Square Garden on November 28. But for unknown reasons, Martin told . jail wardens about the plot and Staake, 41, was arrested in Vermont on . an unrelated outstanding warrant while driving with 23-year-old Ruane. Ruane was released but was later recorded discussing plans with Martin on the phone. According to court documents obtained by the Sun Newspaper, when Mr . Martin asked what Staake had bought to castrate the victims, Ruane said . he had bought a pair of hand-held hedge clippers. When Ruane was arrested in New York on . November 20 police discovered a brand new pair of Fiskars Durasharp . pruning shears in his car. A police document sates: 'In response . to Mr Staake’s reluctance to follow through with the castrations, Mr . Ruane stated he was going to do it and get ‘five large for each one I . get’. Mr Martin confirmed that Mr Ruane was going to get $2,500 per . testicle.' Mastermind: Dana Martin was arrested for raping and killing a 15-year-old girl in 2000 (seen here), but since spending time behind bars, his newest teenage target appears to be the Canadian singer . Criminal relatives: Mark Staake (left) met Martin in prison and agreed to take on the assassination plot with the help of his nephew Tanner Ruane (right) Martin is currently serving two life sentences for raping and killing a 15-year-old girl in 2000. In an affidavit enclosed with Tanner . Ruane's warrant Martin explained that had plotted the attack because he . was upset that Bieber had snubbed his attempts to make contact. According to the arrest warrant Martin . had asked Ruane if they had bags to put the testicles in and had . suggested hiding them in the engine compartment of the car to avoid . detection should they get pulled over by police. The court papers state: 'When asked to . explain why Victim 3 (Bieber) was to be killed, Mr Martin stated that . Victim 3 has a measure of fame and that he had become infatuated with . Victim 3. Turning against them: Martin was the one who reported the plot to police, even though he planned the whole operation, including the instruction to use paisley ties (right) since those were his 'calling card' 'Mr Martin stated he had attempted to solicit correspondence on numerous occasions and that Victim 3 never returned in kind. 'This perceived slight made Mr Martin . upset and, coupled with Mr Martin’s perception of being a ‘nobody’ in . prison, led him to begin plotting the kidnap and murder.' As Martin is already serving life . sentences it is not known if he will face further charges. But a New . York State Police spokesman said he may be responsible for other . kidnaps and murders across America. A spokesman for Bieber, 18, who has sold more than 15million albums since bursting on the scene in 2009, said every precaution was taken to protect the star and his fans. WATCH THE VIDEO .

It was one of the most enduring hoaxes in history and fooled scientists into believing a crucial evolutionary 'missing link' had been found in England. Now 100 years after the discovery of the Piltdown Man, a team of archeologists and anthropologists will finally be able to expose the truth behind the scam, and pinpoint who was responsible. The Geological Society will meet this week to discuss the results of their investigation into the elaborate hoax, almost a century to the day after the same society hailed its importance to the world. Fraud: A replica model of the 'Piltdown Man' hoax skull. The original was comprised of a human skull and an ape jaw, possibly from an organutan . Excavation: Charles Dawson (sitting) poses at the Piltdown gravel pit in 1913 alongside Robert Kenwood Jr, left, Arthur Smith Woodward, far right, and 'Chipper' the goose . Elaborate hoax: A Natural History Museum scientist examines the Piltdown Man fragments during a previous investigation . The remains of Eoanthropas dawsoni was discovered alongside stone tools and animal fossils in a gravel pit in Piltdown, East Sussex, in December, 1912. For almost 40 years archeologists believed it was the missing piece in the link between humans and apes. The scam was only exposed when modern techniques showed the fossils, once belied to be around 500,000 years old, were was in fact a recent composite of two different species - a human skull and an ape jaw, believed to be an orangutan. Among those implicated in the fraud was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who invented Sherlock Holmes and composed his own paleontological thriller The Lost World. But the prime suspect remains amateur fossil hunter Charles Dawson, who 'found' the pieces of skull and jaw. And it is hoped new tests will conclusively prove him as the culprit. Dr Miles Russell, an archaeologist at Bournemouth University who has published a book called The Piltdown Man Hoax: Case Closed, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'It is quite clear that over his lifetime he fabricated 38 separate dubious finds all of which seem to have been intended to impress museum curators to get into different scientific societies. 'When you look at the finds, however, they seem to have happened within 15 miles of his house in East Sussex. In many cases material he found then went missing after he described it.' Exposed: The 1953 meeting in which Geological Society revealed the Piltdown Man to be a hoax . Among the 'finds' Dawson made were one of the earliest timber boats in the country, that went missing shortly after discovery, and a tooth he said was a missing link between reptiles and mammals. The Piltdown Man 'fossils' were locked away followings Dawson's death in 1916 and it was not until 1949 that scientists were able to carry out extensive tests. Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle, who lived near the site, was one of the people rumoured to have been involved in the hoax . As well as discovering the remains originated from two different species, they also found microscopic scratches on the teeth, proving they had been filed down to appear more human like. Most of the finds at the site, including the tools, had been artificially stained to match the local gravel colour. In the recent investigation, scientists subjected the bone fragments to DNA analysis to prove which ape species the jaw came from. Tests on the different stainsused in the Piltdown Man will also finally prove who was responsible. If material obtained at the two sites match then Dawson is the most likely culprit. Natural History Museum anthropologist Professor Chris Stringer, who is leading the study, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'We haven't got a signed confession so we can never know conclusively, but I think we can add more evidence that it was probably one person who was responsible. 'That person was probably Dawson.' But despite being a fraud Prof Dawson believes the Piltdown Man does have a genuine importance. He said: 'The hoax is a stark reminder to . scientists that if something seems too good to be true then perhaps it . is too good to be true. 'It is a warning to scientists to keep . their critical guard up, but on the positive side it is also an example . of the eventual triumph of the scientific method.'","Scientists tested remains of 1912 hoax to discover who was responsible .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:08 EST, 18 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:32 EST, 18 October 2012 . A ten-year-old girl died following an epileptic fit in her sleep, after doctors 'missed opportunities' to diagnose her with the condition, an inquest heard. Dena Hale was found cold and unresponsive by her mother Debbie on the morning of March 3, 2011. Despite her frantic father performing CPR and the efforts of paramedics who attended the family home in Normanton, West Yorkshire, Dena was pronounced dead at nearby Pinderfields Hospital that morning. Dena Hale had shown symptoms of likely neurological problems in the form of epilepsy before her death . The Wakefield inquest heard that Dena had been to her GP surgery with slurred speech and pins and needles in August 2009 - where she was seen by a locum doctor. The locum doctor had written in her notes that he thought she had been dehydrated, adding 'refer to specialist' - but this referral never happened, something which coroner David Hinchliff called a 'missed opportunity” to diagnose her. Her regular GP at the Newland surgery, Dr Ram Prasad Gupta, was also unable to understand a memo the locum had written on Dena’s notes - ‘CSOS’ - which another doctor had to translate as ‘See in an emergency’. Speaking through their representative Mr Oliver Longstaff, Dena’s mother and father Stephen asked the GP why the locum’s notes had not been followed up. Mr Longstaff asked Dr Gupta: 'From his notes, do you believe the locum should do the referral or you?' To which the GP answered: 'He should.' Mr Longstaff asked: 'So if there was a suggestion that there should be a referral that was never followed up? And if he doesn’t then the suggestion just gets lost in the system?' Dr Gupta said: 'Yes.' But coroner Hinchliff also noted that Dena had been seen by a specialist after visiting the A&E in January 2010 when her parents said she had suffered a fit - but even after this she had not been diagnosed with epilepsy or put on any medication. He noted that she had been given a wake EEG (electroencephalogram), which is used to pick up electrical activity in the brain, but not a sleep EEG.And when she was reviewed in a surgery a year later, it was found that she had not had any more episodes. Prof Judith Cross, an expert witness, said she thought Dena could have been suffering from Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes, which occurs in children after the age of five and usually stops when they reach 14, and presents itself with pins and needles and trouble speaking, and in the majority occurs in sleep. Prof Cross also explained that if Dena had been diagnosed with the epilepsy, there would have then been a discussion with the family about whether or not to place her on treatment. In her opinion, this would have been of comfort to the family. Asked by the coroner whether the GP should have referred Dena to a specialist after she visited in August 2009, Prof Cross said yes, but she also agreed with the statement that GPs were not specialists and could not be expected to know every symptom of every condition. A post-mortem examination found teeth marks on Dena’s lip and tongue, which pathologist Dr Mudher Al-Adnani noted was consistent with an epileptic fit, but added that there are few other signs after someone has suffered a fit. Recording a verdict of death by natural causes caused by sudden and unexplained death in epilepsy, Coroner Hinchliff said: 'I’m very conscious that Dena has showed symptoms of likely neurological problems in the form of epilepsy. Dena was declared dead at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield in March 2011 . 'She was seen by her GP on more than one occasion I think that there were indications there that would have been appropriate for her to be referred to the appropriate clinicians with expertise both in paediatrics and epilepsy for her to have been reviewed and followed up. 'Had that been the case then based on the fact that there were at least two events that were suggestive of some epileptic activity some diagnosis could have been made. 'Then, assuming this, there would have been a discussion about treatment and options. 'Whether that would have been putting Dena on some kind of medication would have been discussed. 'I strongly suspect that Dena’s parents would have had reassurance if there had been a positive diagnosis, and been a discussion of options. 'As part of that a sleep EEG should have been performed. Whether that would have been diagnostically helpful can only be guessed. I’m troubled by the records of the GP, in particular when the locum doctor has made reference to a referral that did not happen. I would regard that as a missed opportunity.' But he added: 'Bearing in mind even if Dena had had the review and even if she had been prescribed medication it wouldn’t necessarily have meant that should would have been saved. 'The medication and treatment helps to alleviate the symptoms, it doesn’t cure them.' Speaking after the inquest, Dena’s mother Debbie, 37, said: 'We’ve been through hell since Dena died and we’re still going through it. 'Dena was a lovely, friendly girl who lit up a room when she walked into it. If she saw anyone upset she wanted to make it better. 'The coroner talked about missed opportunities but the biggest missed opportunity is Dena’s missed opportunities - she should have been at high school now, playing with her friends, spending time with her family. 'We tried so many times to get answers - but no-one would listen to us.' Teacher Debbie, who is married to 59-year-old Stephen, a driving instructor, added: 'The inquest hasn’t answered many of our questions; it’s just given up lots more.' A statement issued on behalf of the family added: 'Further questions now arise as to the impact of the ‘missed opportunities’ and whether Dena would still be alive if appropriate action had been taken.' Switalskis Solicitors also confirmed that the family will be pursuing a claim for medical negligence in respect of the treatment received by Dena concerning her undiagnosed epileptic condition.","Parents took Dena to her GP with slurred speech and pins in needles .

With its low-flying helicopters slipping under the radar into Pakistan and special forces commandos leaping into the dark compound below, last year’s stunning operation to kill Osama Bin Laden was a Boy’s Own drama that had old-fashioned machismo written all over it. The reality of America’s battle against terrorism, it seemed, couldn’t have been more different to the glamorised, politically-correct fiction of Homeland, the hit TV show in which Claire Danes plays a beautiful CIA agent who spots the Al Qaeda plot which her misguided male colleagues have missed. The world’s most dangerous terror group foiled by a killer blonde in Calvin Klein who wars with her superiors? Only in Hollywood’s dreams, surely. Scroll down for video . CIA supersleuth: A attractive young female CIA agent, played by Jessica Chastain in the film Zero Dark Thirty, spent the best part of a decade to finding Bin Laden and became the SEALs' go-to expert on intelligence matters about their target . But, astonishingly, it has now emerged that truth may indeed be as strange as fiction. According to Zero Dark Thirty, a forthcoming film about the hunt for Bin Laden — whose makers were given top-level access to those involved — he might never have been found if it hadn’t been for an attractive young female CIA agent every bit as troublesome as Homeland’s Carrie Mathison. CIA insiders have confirmed claims by the film’s director Kathryn Bigelow that she is entirely justified in focusing on the role played by a junior female CIA analyst, named Maya in the film and played by Jessica Chastain. And just as in Homeland, the real agent has been snubbed by superiors and fallen out with colleagues since the Bin Laden raid in May last year. But who is this CIA supersleuth? Although the woman is still undercover and has never been identified, Zero Dark Thirty’s emphasis on Maya’s importance tallies with the account of a U.S. Navy SEAL involved in the raid who later wrote about it in a book. Bin Laden hunt: A very different side of the agent was seen days after Bin Laden's body was brought back. She even started crying . Matt Bissonnette writes in No Easy Day of flying out to Afghanistan before the raid with a CIA analyst he called ‘Jen’ who was ‘wicked smart, kind of feisty’ and liked to wear expensive high heels. She had devoted the best part of a decade to finding Bin Laden and had become the SEALs’ go-to expert on intelligence matters about their target, he said. And while her colleagues were only 60 per cent sure their quarry was in the compound in Abbottabad, she told the SEAL she was 100 per cent certain. ‘I can’t give her enough credit, I mean, she, in my opinion, she kind of teed up this whole thing,’ Bissonnette said later. The commando saw a very different side of her days later when they brought Bin Laden’s body back to their Afghan hangar. Having previously told Bissonnette she didn’t want to see the body, ‘Jen’ stayed at the back of the crowd as they unzipped the terrorist’s body bag. She ‘looked pale and stressed’ and started crying. ‘A couple of the SEALs put their arms around her and walked her over to the edge of the group to look at the body,’ wrote Bissonnette. ‘She didn’t say anything . . . with tears rolling down her cheeks, I could tell it was taking a while for Jen to process. She’d spent half a decade tracking this man. And now there he was at her feet.’ Jen’s role in the operation passed largely unremarked when Bissonnette’s book came out but now the new film — which is released in the UK in January — has confirmed his estimation of her importance. Although she remains active as a CIA analyst, it is believed Mark Boal, Bigelow’s screenwriter, was allowed to interview her at length. It has emerged that she is in her 30s and joined the CIA after leaving college and before the 9/11 attacks turned American security upside down. On target: The agent was one of the first to advance the theory that the key to finding Bin Laden lay in Al Qaeda's courier network which led to his compound (pictured is the attack scene in the movie) According to the Washington Post, she worked in the CIA’s station in Islamabad, Pakistan, as a ‘targeter’, a role which involves finding people to recruit as spies or to obliterate in drone attacks. But CIA insiders say she worked almost solely on finding Bin Laden for a decade. She was still in Pakistan when the hunt heated up after Barack Obama became President in 2008 and ordered a renewed effort to find him. According to colleagues, the female agent was one of the first to advance the theory — apparently against the views of other CIA staff — that the key to finding Bin Laden lay in Al Qaeda’s courier network. The agency was convinced Bin Laden, who never used the phone, managed to communicate with his disparate organisation without revealing his whereabouts by passing hand-delivered messages to trusted couriers. The agent spent years pursuing the courier angle, and it was a hunch that proved spectacularly correct when the U.S. uncovered a courier known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti and tracked him back to a compound in the sleepy Pakistan town of Abbottabad. Fiesty: Jessica Chastain as agent Maya in Zero Dark Thirty about the hunt for Bin Laden . It was a stunning success for the dedicated agent, though she hardly endeared herself to her colleagues in the process. As one might expect of a woman . working in the largely male world of intelligence, colleagues stress she . is no shrinking violet but a prickly workaholic with a reputation for . clashing with anyone — even senior intelligence chiefs — who disagreed . with her. ‘She’s not Miss Congeniality, but that’s not going to find Osama Bin Laden,’ a former colleague told the Washington Post. Another . added: ‘Do you know how many CIA officers are jerks? If that was a . disqualifier, the whole National Clandestine Service would be gone.’ In . the film, Maya is portrayed as a loner who has a . ‘her-against-the-world’ attitude and pummels superiors into submission . by sheer force of will. CIA colleagues say the film’s depiction of her . is spot-on. If this is the case, then she shows . little of the feminine tenderness that serves Carrie Mathison so well in . Homeland and which Hollywood usually uses to soften female protagonists . like Maya. Instead, the film shows her happily colluding in the torture by waterboarding of an Al Qaeda suspect. And . Navy SEAL Bissonnette reported how she had told him she wasn’t in . favour of storming the Bin Laden compound but preferred to ‘just push . the easy button and bomb it’. Given that the bombing option would almost . certainly have killed the women and children the CIA knew were inside, . her comment suggests a cold indifference to  ‘civilian’ casualties. But then the real female agent is hardly your archetypal film heroine. She has reportedly been passed over for promotion since the Bin Laden raid, perhaps adding to her sense of grievance. Although she was among a handful of CIA staff rewarded over the operation with the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the agency’s highest honour, dozens of other colleagues were given lesser gongs. Fellow staff say this prompted her . anger to boil over: she hit ‘reply all’ to an email announcing the . awards and added her own message which — according to one — effectively . said: ‘You guys tried to obstruct me. You fought me. Only I deserve the . award.’ Although colleagues . say the intense attention she received from the film-makers has made . many of them jealous, they are shocked she was passed over for promotion . and merely given a cash bonus for her Bin Laden triumph. Glamorised fiction: The reality of America's battle against terrorism couldn't have been more different to the politically-correct hit TV show Homeland, in which Claire Danes plays a beautiful CIA agent who spots the Al Qaeda plot which her misguided colleagues missed . She has also been moved within the CIA, reassigned to a new counter-terrorism role. Bigelow, who won an Oscar as director of the Iraq war drama The Hurt Locker, has said it was like being dealt a Royal Flush at poker when she discovered a woman at the heart of the story. ‘The juicy thing about Maya was the surprise of it,’ she said. One thing is certain: The emotional cost of her achievement took its toll on her. Bissonnette recalls seeing her again as he and his comrades got on to a plane back to their main base at Bagram in Afghanistan. She was sitting on the floor of the plane sobbing, ‘hugging her legs to her chest in the fetal position’. Her eyes were ‘puffy and she seemed to be staring into the distance’. When he tried to reassure her that the mission had been a ‘100 per cent’ success, she simply nodded and started crying again. He put it down to a mixture of exhaustion and relief for a woman who had, with almost messianic zeal, dedicated her life to hunting down the architect of 9/11.

Joseph Woodland, co-inventor with Bernard Silver of the bar code that labels nearly every product in stores today, died on Sunday at the age of 91 . Scanned more than five million times a day, instantaneously encoding product data while boosting work production, it was with Norman Joseph Woodland's fingers in the sand that he first invented the revolutionizing bar code. Mr Woodland, deemed co-inventor of the what was originally a circular emblem of lines that would later become responsible for nearly every product labeling in stores, died on Sunday at the age of 91. Suffering the effect Alzheimer's disease and complications of his advanced age in his home in Edgewater, New Jersey, his daughter, Susan Woodland of New York, announced his death on Thursday. As an undergraduate student at what's now called Drexel University in Philadelphia, it was after later co-inventor Bernard Silver  overheard a grocery-store executive's pleas to the engineering school's dean for students for help. His request was an invention that would quickly capture product information at checkout that both were inspired, according to Susan Woodland. Woodland notably had worked on the Manhattan Project, the U.S. military's atomic bomb development team. After having already earned a mechanical engineering degree, Woodland dropped out of graduate school to work on the bar code idea. He stole away to spend time with his grandfather in Miami to focus on developing a code that could symbolically capture details about an item, Susan Woodland. Patented: Mr Woodland's original 1952 patent for the bar code, pictured left, was circular allowing it to be scanned from any direction while right, a device capable of reading it is seen . Modernized: IBM promoted a rectangular barcode to the inventors' circular version, leading to a standard for universal product code, or UPC, technology . The only code Woodland knew was the Morse Code he'd learned in the Boy Scouts, his daughter said. One day, he drew Morse dots and dashes as he sat on the beach and absent-mindedly left his fingers in the sand where they traced a series of parallel lines. 'It was a moment of inspiration. He said, 'instead of dots and dashes I can have thick and thin bars,'' Susan Woodland said. Woodland and Silver submitted their patent in 1949 for a code patterned on concentric circles that looked like a bull's eye. The patent was issued in 1952, 60 years ago this fall. Silver died in 1963. Both eventually sold their patent for $15,000 to Philco, making the most they ever received from their patent. Woodland joined IBM in 1951 hoping to develop the bar code, but the technology wasn't accepted for more than two decades until lasers made it possible to read the code readily, the technology company said. In the early 1970s, Woodland moved to Raleigh to join a team at IBM's Research Triangle Park, N.C., facility. About . 10 years after the patent had expired, the team developed a . bar-code-reading laser scanner system in response to demand from . grocers' desires to automate and speed checkout while also cutting . handling and inventory management costs. Solution: Appealing to grocers' desires to speed up checkout, IBM developed a bar-code-reading laser scanner system, one right, capable of reading them at little expense modernizing the code into a universal symbol, seen tattooed left . Challenge: A QR Code, developed in Japan, is growing in competition to the original UPC code while this one can be scanned using cell phones . IBM promoted a rectangular barcode that led to a standard for universal product code technology. The first product sold using a UPC scan was a 67-cent package of Wrigley's chewing gum at a supermarket in Troy, Ohio, in June 1974, according to GS1 US, the American affiliate of the global standard-setting UPC body. Today, about 5 billion products are scanned and tracked worldwide every day. Woodland was born Sept 6, 1921, in Atlantic City, N.J. Woodland and Microsoft founder Bill Gates were among those honored at the White House in 1992 for their achievements to technology, four months after President George H.W. Bush appeared amazed at a demonstration of a grocery checkout machine.","Norman Joseph Woodland died on Sunday in his New Jersey home after suffering Alzheimer's disease .

Older people who feel alone are much more at risk of the degenerative brain disease (posed by model) Lonely people are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s in later life, say researchers. Their study revealed a significant link between feelings of solitariness – rather than having no friends – and the risk of having the degenerative brain disease. Earlier studies have suggested social isolation or lack of personal contact carries an increased risk of dementia and mental decline. Researchers running the Amsterdam Study of the Elderly tracked the long term health and wellbeing of more than 2,000 patients without signs of dementia. Among those who lived alone, almost one in ten developed dementia after three years compared with one in 20 of those who lived with others. Among those who had never married, similar proportions developed dementia as remained free from the condition, possibly because their lifestyles meant they were not the type to feel lonely. When it came to those who said they felt lonely, more than twice as many developed dementia – 13.4 per cent compared with 5.7 per cent. It is possible that feeling lonely is actually a signal of mental decline that in turn affects social skills, says the study published online in the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry. But feelings of loneliness may also be the mark of 'vulnerable' personality or an expression of a 'frailty factor' that puts certain people at higher risk of dementia, it says. Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, affecting over 800,000 Britons, with about 500 cases diagnosed every day. One theory is that feeling lonely is actually a signal of mental decline that in turn affects social skills, say the researchers . The Amsterdam study said: 'These results suggest that feelings of loneliness independently contribute to the risk of dementia in later life. 'Interestingly, the fact that 'feeling lonely' rather than 'being alone' was associated with dementia onset suggests that it is not the objective situation, but, rather, the perceived absence of social attachments that increases the risk of cognitive decline.' Jessica Smith, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said strong evidence suggested the best way to reduce the risks was to exercise, eat well and avoid smoking. 'As Christmas approaches, many of us are looking forward to full houses and festive parties,' she said.'However, for others it can be a time that can really heighten loneliness.' Dr Simon Ridley of Alzheimer’s Research UK, the nation’s leading dementia research charity, said the findings could have important consequences for society. 'Age still remains the biggest risk factor for dementia, but this study links feelings of loneliness to a slightly higher risk of the condition,' he said. 'While such a finding could have important consequences for society, it is hard to determine cause and effect at this stage - feelings of loneliness could be a consequence of the early stages of dementia rather than a contributing factor.'","Dutch researchers found a significant link between .

Few details about the plot were provided by prosecutors or outlined in a brief, three-page grand jury indictment. Authorities said the case was not an FBI sting operation but declined any additional comment. ‘Any potential threat posed by these two individuals has been disrupted,’ said Miami U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer. In Washington, Justice Department . national security spokesman Dean Boyd called the case ‘an ongoing, very . active investigation’ but provided no specifics. The . indictment charges that the two provided money, property, lodging, . communications equipment and other support for a conspiracy to obtain a . weapon of mass destruction between July 2011 and this week. The goal was to ‘use a weapon of mass . destruction (explosives) against persons and property within the United . States,’ prosecutors said in a news release. It wasn't clear whether the conspirators actually did obtain explosives or what their potential targets might have been. Threat disrupted: Wifredo Ferrer, U.S Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, said any potential threat has been disrupted . The Qazi brothers had initial court appearances Friday, but court-appointed attorneys for the two did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. One official who spoke to ABC News described the younger brother's intent as ‘serious,’ but the source said it did not appear that an attack was imminent. ‘This was not a sting,’ sources told the news channel, adding that Raees Alam Qazi had been in contact with overseas radicals, possibly connected to al Qaeda. Still, the FBI found evidence that Raees Alam Qazi had been monitoring recent FBI ‘sting’ cases, sources told ABC. The Qazi brothers are being held at the Broward County Main Jail in Florida. An arraignment and bond hearing to decide whether they will remain locked up pending trial is scheduled for Dec. 7. They are both charged with conspiring to provide material support to terrorists, which carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence, and with conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. The maximum is life in prison for that charge. South Florida has seen several high-profile terrorism cases, including the conviction of al-Qaida operative Jose Padilla and the convictions of five men accused of plotting to join forces with al-Qaida to destroy a landmark Chicago skyscraper and bomb FBI offices in several cities. More recently, a Miami Muslim cleric and one of his sons are facing trial on charges they provided thousands of dollars in financial support to the Pakistani Taliban terrorism group.

The last photography craze to sweep the internet, known as 'planking', saw people balancing poker-straight on inanimate, often dangerous, objects. But a new craze has gone viral whereby internet users picture themselves doing something even more risky - taking their heads off. Photographs are beginning to flood the web showing seemingly beheaded people standing beside a detached head. Scroll down for video . Where's your head at: The craze, known as horsemanning, has started to sweep the internet. The name is derived from the Headless Horseman . Craze: Horsemanning is not a new craze and is thought to have been performed in front of cameras since the 1920s . Ouch: People adopt humourous positions to make it appear they have been beheaded . With the swift death of 'planking' and 'owling', it was only a matter of time before 'horsemaning' had its moment once more. Spurred by historical pictures of people cleverly posing as if they had been beheaded, internet users have flooded sites with their own takes on the concept. The craze is a homage to the folklore character, the Headless Horseman. The optical trick sees people positioning their bodies so that their head cannot be seen. Another person then positions themselves nearby, making it appear that the head has been detached. Heads will roll: Whether it is going to work, or posing by the Great Wall of China, tricksters can easily seize the moment for a spot of horsemanning . Open wider: Horsemanning helps this man eat a slice of pizza while lying on his back . Head on a string: Internet users get the opportunity to show off their flexibility, with this woman bending backwards to hide her head . The set-up allows people room for improvisation, often with hilarious results. But if the savvy photgraphers taking the snaps think they are being wholly original by partaking in the craze, they may want to think again. Horsemanning dates as far back as the 1920s, when it was a popular way to pose for photographs. Inventive users often use props such as sofas to perform the trick, but some are slightly darker, placing their headless bodies in machines and under cars. It is the latest in a series of trends to take over message boards and forums. Before 'planking', the internet was awash with people 'owling', whereby they would sit like the nocturnal bird in unusual positions.

Astronomers peering through the Hubble Space Telescope have found galaxies so ancient they describe them as 'baby pictures of the Universe'. The seven galaxies pictured formed relatively shortly after the dawn of time 13.7billion years ago and are the and are the most primitive and distant ever seen. One of the objects may be the oldest galaxy yet found, dating back to a time when the universe was just 380 million years old, a fraction of its current age. Scroll down for video . The Hubble Ultra Deep Field 2012: New data have revealed for the first time a population of distant galaxies at redshifts between 9 and 12, including the most distant object observed to date . 'These early galaxies represent the building blocks of present-day galaxies,' said John Grunsfeld, Nasa's associate administrator for science. The discovery of galaxies dating back to the universe's early years should help scientists figure out what happened after the Universe's 'dark ages'. This was a period of time about 200million years after the Big Bang explosion when cooling clouds of hydrogen, clumped together by gravity, began to ignite, triggering the first generation of stars. 'It was a very important moment in cosmic history,' said astronomer Richard Ellis of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. Scientists do not know exactly when this 'cosmic dawn' occurred and whether it was a single, dramatic event that caused all the galaxies to form their first stars, or whether it happened more gradually over millions of years. The new observations span a period between 350 million and 600 million years after the Big Bang and represent the first reliable census of galaxies at such an early time in cosmic history, the Caltech team says. The astronomers found that the number of galaxies steadily increased as time went on, supporting the idea that the first galaxies didn’t form in a sudden burst but gradually assembled their stars. Furthest look achieved yet: The new galaxies are shown at the top of the picture, and their locations are pinpointed in the main image . Because it takes light billions of years to travel such vast distances, astronomical images show how the universe looked during the period, billions of years ago, when that light first embarked on its journey. The farther away astronomers peer into space, the further back in time they are looking. The latest study explores the deepest reaches of the cosmos - and therefore the most distant past - that has ever been studied with Hubble. 'We’ve made the longest exposure that Hubble has ever taken, capturing some of the faintest and most distant galaxies,' says Richard Ellis, astronomy professor at Caltech and the first author of the paper. 'The added depth and our carefully designed observing strategy have been the key features of our campaign to reliably probe this early period of cosmic history.' The results are the first from a new Hubble survey that focused on a small patch of sky known as the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), which was first studied nine years ago. This timeline shows the development of the galaxies in our universe since the Big Bang 13.7billion years ago: Because it takes light billions of years to travel vast distances, the farther away astronomers peer into space, the further back in time they are looking . The astronomers used Hubble’s Wide . Field Camera 3 (WFC3) to observe the HUDF in near-infrared light over a . period of six weeks during August and September 2012. To . determine the distances to these galaxies, the team measured their . colours using four filters that allow Hubble to capture near-infrared . light at specific wavelengths. Pushed to its limit: The observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope (pictured) will be expanded on by the planned James Webb Space Telescope . 'We . employed a filter that has not been used in deep imaging before, and . undertook much deeper exposures in some filters than in earlier work, in . order to convincingly reject the possibility that some of our galaxies . might be foreground objects,' said team member James Dunlop of the . University of Edinburgh's Institute for Astronomy. The . filters allowed the astronomers to measure the light that was absorbed . by neutral hydrogen, which filled the universe beginning about 400,000 . years after the Big Bang. As . stars and galaxies started to form roughly 200million years after the . Big Bang they bathed the cosmos with ultraviolet light, which ionised . the neutral hydrogen by stripping an electron from each hydrogen atom. This so-called 'epoch of reionisation' lasted until the universe was about a billion years old. If . everything in the universe were stationary, astronomers would see that . only a specific wavelength of light was absorbed by neutral hydrogen. But the universe is expanding, and this stretches the wavelengths of . light coming from galaxies. The . amount that the light is stretched - called the redshift - depends on . distance: the farther away a galaxy is, the greater the redshift. Launched from the Space Shuttle in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope sits 353 miles above the surface of the Earth peering into the cosmos with a view uninhibited by interference from our atmosphere. Shifting pockets of air distort light from space — that's why stars seem to twinkle when viewed from the ground. Furthermore, the atmosphere blocks some wavelengths of light partially or entirely, making space the only place where it is possible to get a truly clear and comprehensive view of the universe. In its first 15 years, the telescope recorded over 700,000 images and helped to expand our understanding of star birth, star death, galaxy evolution, and has helped move black holes from theory to fact. Hubble's large mirror collects light from celestial objects and directs it to the telescope's instruments, the astronomer’s eyes to the universe. Hubble's current instruments are the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), and Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS). It is set to be replaced by the James Webb Space Telescope, due for launch in 2018, which will orbit a million miles from Earth. It is hoped that the infrared-optimised Webb will find the first galaxies that formed in the early Universe, connecting the Big Bang to our own Milky Way Galaxy. As . a result of this cosmic expansion, astronomers observe that the . absorption of light by neutral hydrogen occurs at longer wavelengths for . more distant galaxies. The . filters enabled the researchers to determine at which wavelength the . light was absorbed; this revealed the distance to the galaxy - and . therefore the period in cosmic history when it is being formed. Using this technique to penetrate further and further back in time, the team found a steadily decreasing number of galaxies. 'Our . data confirms that reionisation is a drawn-out process occurring over . several hundred million years with galaxies slowly building up their . stars and chemical elements,' said co-author Brant Robertson of the . University of Arizona in Tucson. 'There wasn’t a single dramatic moment when galaxies formed; it’s a gradual process.' The new observations - which pushed Hubble to its technical limits - hint at what is to come with next-generation infrared space telescopes, the researchers say. To probe even further back in time to see ever more primitive galaxies, astronomers will need to observe in wavelengths longer than those that can be detected by Hubble. That’s because cosmic expansion has stretched the light from the most distant galaxies so much that they glow predominantly in the infrared. The upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, slated for launch in a few years, will target those galaxies. 'Although we may have reached back as far as Hubble will see, Hubble has, in a sense, set the stage for Webb,' says team member Anton Koekemoer of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. 'Our work indicates there is a rich field of even earlier galaxies that Webb will be able to study.' The research appears in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.","One of the objects may be the oldest galaxy yet found, dating back to when the cosmos was just 380million years old .

One of the images however shows the heart-stopping moment Timmons attempts to land a trick jump but misses his footing. Fortunately participants of the highlining are tethered to the line so that they don't fall. Highlining is a form of slacklining, which is the art of balancing on two inch wide nylon webbing tensioned between to points. The sport is similar to walking a tightrope, only the webbing used in highlining has more slack. Sedona is situated on the county line between the Coconino and Yavapai counties in the northern Verde Valley region of the state of Arizona.

The rocks appear to glow in brilliant orange and red when illuminated by the rising or setting sun and are the home to activities ranging from extreme sports to spiritual pursuits. Rope walking has been around in various forms for thousands of years, but the origin of slacklining is usually attributed to rock climbers Adam Grosowsky and Jeff Ellington from their time at Washington's The Evergreen State College in 1979.

Bork, who stepped in to fire the Watergate prosecutor at Richard Nixon's behest and whose failed 1980s nomination to the Supreme Court helped draw the modern boundaries of cultural fights over abortion, civil rights and other issues, has died. He was 85. Son Robert H. Bork Jr. confirmed his father died Wednesday at Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington, Va. The son said Bork died from complications of heart ailments. Brilliant, blunt, and piercingly witty, Robert Heron Bork had a long career in politics and the law that took him from respected academic to a totem of conservative grievance. Brilliant, blunt, and piercingly witty: Robert Bork had a long career in politics and the law that took him from respected academic to a totem of conservative grievance . Along the way, Bork was accused of being a partisan hatchet man for Nixon when, as the third-ranking official at the Justice Department he fired Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the Saturday Night Massacre of 1973. Attorney General Elliot Richardson resigned rather than fire Cox. The next in line, William Ruckelshaus, refused to fire Cox and was himself fired. Bork's drubbing during the 1987 Senate nomination hearings made him a hero to the right and a rallying cry for younger conservatives. The Senate experience embittered Bork and hardened many of his conservative positions, even as it gave him prominence as an author and long popularity on the conservative speaking circuit. 'Robert Bork was a giant, a brilliant and fearless legal scholar, and a gentleman whose incredible wit and erudition made him a wonderful Hudson colleague,' said Kenneth Weinstein, head of the Washington think-tank Hudson Institute where Bork was a distinguished fellow. Known before his Supreme Court nomination as one of the foremost national experts on antitrust law, Bork became much more widely known as a conservative cultural critic in the years that followed. With President Reagan in 1987: Bork's failed Supreme Court nomination amassed the largest ever negative vote . His 1996 book, 'Slouching Towards toward Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline,' was an acid indictment of what Bork viewed as the crumbling ethics of modern society and the morally bankrupt politics of the left. 'Opportunities for teen-agers to engage in sex are ... more frequent than previously; much of it takes place in homes that are now empty because the mothers are working,' Bork wrote then. 'The modern liberal devotion to sex education is an ideological commitment rather than a policy of prudence.' Bork, known until his death as 'Judge Bork,' served a relatively short tenure on the bench. He was a federal judge on the nation's most prestigious appellate panel, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, from 1982 until 1988, when he resigned in the wake of the bitter Supreme Court nomination fight. Earlier, Bork had been a private attorney, Yale Law School professor and a Republican political appointee. At Yale, two of his constitutional law students were Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham. 'I no longer say they were students,' Bork joked long afterward. 'I say they were in the room.' Nixon named Bork as solicitor general, the administration's advocate before the Supreme Court, in January, 1973. President Gerald Ford, left, introduces Supreme Court nominee Bork, center, at confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill in 1987. Ford praised Bork as being 'uniquely qualified' Bork served as acting attorney general after Richardson's resignation, then returned to the solicitor general's job until 1977, far outlasting the Nixon administration. Long mentioned as a possible Supreme Court nominee, Bork got his chance toward the end of Ronald Reagan's second term. He was nominated July 1, 1987, to fill the seat vacated by Justice Lewis F. Powell. Nearly four months later the Senate voted 58-42 to defeat him, after the first national political and lobbying offensive mounted against a judicial nominee. It was the largest negative vote ever recorded for a Supreme Court nominee. Reagan and Bork's Senate backers called him eminently qualified - a brilliant judge who had managed to write nearly a quarter of his court's majority rulings in just five years on the bench, without once being overturned by the Supreme Court. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., summed up the opposition by saying, 'In Robert Bork's America there is no room at the inn for blacks and no place in the Constitution for women.' Critics also called Bork a free-speech censor and a danger to the principle of separation of church and state. Bork's opponents used his prolific writings against him, and some called him a hypocrite when he seemed to waffle on previous strongly worded positions. Bork was accused of being a partisan hatchet man for Richard Nixon when, as the third-ranking official at the Justice Department he fired Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the Saturday Night Massacre of 1973 . Despite a reputation for personal charm, Bork did not play well on television. He answered questions in a seemingly bloodless, academic style and he cut a severe figure, with hooded eyes and heavy, rustic beard. Stoic and stubborn throughout, Bork refused to withdraw when his defeat seemed assured. The fight has defined every high-profile judicial nomination since, and largely established the opposing roles of vocal and well-funded interest groups in Senate nomination fights. Bork would say later that the ferocity of the fight took him and the Reagan White House by surprise, and he rebuked the administration for not doing more to salvage his nomination. The process begat a verb, 'to bork,' meaning vilification of a nominee on ideological grounds. In later years, some accused Bork of borking Clinton nominees with nearly the zeal that some liberal commentators had pursued him. Bork denied any animus, and said he was happy commenting, writing and making money outside government. Even friends did not entirely believe that. 'He was very embittered by the experience,' said lawyer Andrew Frey, a longtime friend who worked for Bork in the solicitor general's office. 'He was not well treated, and partly as a result of that he did become more conservative.'

But the traditional taxi hail could soon be a thing of the past. The city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission announced today to approve a pilot program allowing riders to use their smartphones to ‘e-hail’ a yellow cab as early as next February. The technological step is revolutionary for many reasons, with one being that before now, it has been illegal for the iconic taxicabs to pre-arrange rides. Thing of the past: A new app will allow passengers to 'e-hail' cabs, making for a lot less exasperated commuters (stock photo) The tests, which are slated to start on February 15, are an answer to a growing question of how smartphones have been used for transport around the city. Uber fun: The Uber app is available in other cities; its New York pilot version will be tested for a year . 'We should not ignore technology that's out there. This is not speculative, this is real,' Commissioner David Yassky told the Associated Press. The commission issued a news release after the vote celebrating what it called 'appy days ahead.' The system will be tried out for one year. After the free apps start linking customers with drivers in mid-February, the commission will produce quarterly reports on the program's success, leading to a decision on whether to extend it. At least a dozen companies are ready to provide the service, including ones now operating in other U.S. cities and overseas. London has a thriving taxi e-hail system. Commission research showed drivers still prefer to pick up gesturing passengers, Yassky said. 'They'll still tend to pick up a ride that's there first,' he said. 'I think drivers will use the app when there's no passenger out there.' Mensah Kwabenah, a cabbie waiting for customers near Penn Station, said he'll respond to app hails if his cab owner wants him to. The 56-year-old driver said that personally, he felt checking his phone for a customer's location 'is going to be a distraction, and it could cause accidents' — even if the cell phone is mounted. No need to lift a finger: Hailing a taxi on a New York street is going high-tech, with a smartphone application . A potential fare uses the app to request a ride. That request goes out to all participating cabbies within a certain distance, and the cabbie who uses his or her own cellphone to respond first will get the fare. City law prohibits drivers from talking on handheld cellphones, but they will be able to use them to respond to an e-hail. The electronic system is optional for cab companies. The commission was subject to lobbying from the service car industry, which fears loss of business if yellow cabs are allowed to prearrange rides. The commissioner said the city will make sure both drivers and customers are protected. The driver should be able to accept a ride with a single touch after receiving a passenger signal, Yassky said. Distance limits will be built into the technology. For example, from 59th Street to Battery Park in Manhattan — the primary business zone — yellow cabs will be allowed to respond to an electronic hail within a half-mile. Elsewhere in the city, the limit is a mile and a half. Customers may pay by using apps that interact with the technology being used in a particular yellow cab, according to TLC spokesman Allan Fromberg.","TLC announced pilot program allowing riders to digitally hail a cab via a smartphone app .

Banned: Guy Pelly, 30, has been banned from driving after he was caught speeding at 129 mph in an Audi R8 V10 . A socialite friend of Prince William and Prince Harry was banned from driving yesterday. Guy Pelly, who owns a nightclub, was caught by police while doing 129mph on a dual carriageway in a £100,000 Audi. The 30-year-old failed to show up to answer the charge of speeding, claiming to be ill. In his absence, magistrates banned him from driving for 56 days, fined him £750 and ordered him to pay £265 in costs. They were told Pelly was in an Audi R8 V10 when he was stopped on the A303 near Salisbury in Wiltshire on March 17. James Harrison, a barrister appearing on Pelly’s behalf, said his client had been speeding but not at 129mph. However Adrian Ridley, the constable who stopped Pelly, told Salisbury magistrates there was nothing wrong with his speed gun. Stowe-educated Pelly, from Kensington, West London, was banned in 2007 for speeding at 90mph on the M4 in his Volkswagen. Nick Batty, of the road safety charity Brake, said his latest ban was too short. He said: ‘Driving at a speed of 129mph is incredibly dangerous, risky and selfish behaviour which shows no concern for the law or for the safety of other road users.’ Pelly, from Kensington, London, has been friends with the Princes since he met them while fox hunting. And it is thought he even helped organise William's stag do ahead of his marriage to Kate Middleton in April 2011. Pelly was due to appear at Salisbury Magistrates' Court in person but failed to appear because he was ill. The hearing went ahead in his absence. PC Adrian Ridley told the court he had spotted Pelly's car from about 1km away and judged it was travelling 'significantly faster' than the cars around it. He said he had more than 20 years' experience and was satisfied there was nothing wrong with the equipment or the reading it gave. He told the court: 'I was on duty in uniform when I saw an Audi R8 being driven on the A303 at Cholderton. Supercar: Pelly was caught speeding in an Audi R8 V10 which has a top speed of 197 mph . 'In my opinion, the speed was in excess of 70 miles per hour - the speed limit for that road. 'I checked the speed of the vehicle by means of a laser, approved by the Secretary of State. 'To the best of my knowledge and belief, the device was operated in accordance with the approval given. 'The speed recorded on the display meter was 129 miles per hour. I spoke to the driver who gave his name as Guy Pelly.' He added: 'It's not an option at all that there was something wrong with the reading. 'I'm more than happy the speed I got on the device was the correct speed.' Magistrates said they found the policeman 'credible' and were satisfied the device was working accurately. Guidelines say justices should consider a ban for motorists caught exceeding 101 mph. After previously been found guilty of speeding, Pelly unsuccessfully begged magistrates not to disqualify him, saying he needed to give lifts to his disabled mum. She had her right leg amputated below the knee nine years ago following a motorbike accident in Florence, Italy. Pelly was one of a handful of friends who joined the Princes on William's stag do at a secluded mansion in north Devon ahead of his marriage to Kate Middleton. And he previously dated Susanna Warren, granddaughter of the Queen's former racing manager, the Earl of Carnarvon.

Tory peer: Lord McAlpine (pictured in 1998), who had not been contacted by the programme, strenuously denied the allegations, launching legal action . The Newsnight report that led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly named as a paedophile was aired because the production team failed to follow the BBC's own editorial guidelines, a report said today. The broadcast on November 2 was a ‘grave breach which had been costly to all concerned’ and resulted in the public being misled, the BBC Trust's Editorial Standards Committee (ESC) found. Its report, published today, coincided with the Pollard Review into why a Newsnight investigation into broadcaster and DJ Jimmy Savile was shelved. And in its findings, the committee ordered another report by the BBC next year into what steps will be taken to make sure the corporation ‘learns from these events’. The programme, which featured an interview with Steve Messham who said a senior political figure of the time abused him, led to the widespread naming of Lord McAlpine. The Tory peer, who had not been contacted by the programme, strenuously denied the allegations, launching legal action. It later emerged that Mr Messham had not even been shown a photo of the politician - and when he eventually saw one, he realised he had made a mistake. The following week, Newsnight broadcast an apology, as well as apologies from Mr Messham, and Lord McAlpine later received £185,000 damages from the corporation. A report by the BBC, led by the corporation's Scotland director, Ken MacQuarrie, found that Newsnight failed to complete 'basic journalistic checks' and there was confusion about who had the ultimate responsibility for 'final editorial sign-off'. Difficult day: BBC Trust Chairman Lord Patten arrives at BBC Broadcasting House in London ahead the release of the Pollard Report into the BBC's handling of the Jimmy Savile investigation . Out: The botched investigation led to the resignation of director-general George Entwistle (left, with Lord Patten last month) after just 54 days in the job, and three BBC employees have been disciplined . He found that the programme's editorial management structure had been ‘seriously weakened’ as a result of the editor having to step aside over the Savile scandal, and the departure of the deputy editor. Today, the ESC said there was a failure of editorial control within the BBC, adding: 'This was a high-risk report which required rigorous supervision and did not receive it.' The committee's report said a 'most serious breach of the accuracy guidelines had occurred'. 'The allegations were not based on sound evidence. They were not thoroughly tested and, whilst there was no suggestion that the programme-makers had sought to mislead the public, this had been the effect,' Trustees said. 'The combination of the Newsnight report and the online speculation had led to Lord McAlpine being incorrectly identified as Mr Messham's abuser. 'The Trustees noted that the failures by members of the Newsnight team resulted largely from a failure to adhere to the editorial guidelines.' The committee said issues of privacy and fairness obligations were being considered by Ofcom, so it would turn to those after the watchdog had completed its investigation. Mistakes: The programme, which featured an interview with Steve Messham (pictured) who said a senior political figure of the time abused him, led to the widespread naming of Lord McAlpine . It has requested a report from the BBC next year ‘on the steps that will be taken to ensure the BBC learns from these events after Ofcom has published its finding’. ‘The Executive will also be asked to identify where best practice and experience in investigation and editorial control exists in the BBC and share those lessons across the BBC. This report will be published.’ 'The allegations were not based on sound evidence. They were not thoroughly tested and, whilst there was no suggestion that the programme-makers had sought to mislead the public, this had been the effect' BBC Trust . It added: ‘This has been a grave breach which had been costly to all concerned. ‘The Trustees wish to put on record an apology to Lord McAlpine and to the public for this serious failure of BBC journalism.’ The botched investigation led to the resignation of director-general George Entwistle after just 54 days in the job. Three BBC employees have been disciplined. They are Liz Gibbons, the programme's editor and Adrian van Klaveren. Both have moved to other jobs within the corporation. The third is an unidentified employee. It also prompted the corporation to suspend all new investigations by Newsnight, as well as put on hold work with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ), which helped in the programme. Twelve hours before the Newsnight report was broadcast, then-managing editor of the BIJ Iain Overton - who has since resigned - tweeted: ‘If all goes well we've got a Newsnight out tonight about a very senior political figure who is a paedophile’, leading to further speculation throughout the day of broadcast. Television Centre: Today, the ESC said there was a failure of editorial control within the BBC, adding: 'This was a high-risk report which required rigorous supervision and did not receive it' Today's report from the Trust's Editorial and Standards Committee said the failure by Newsnight was 'extremely concerning'. 'The Trustees found it particularly . concerning that, at no point in advance of the broadcast of the . Newsnight report, was Mr Messham shown a photograph of Lord McAlpine and . asked to confirm that he was the individual at the centre of the . allegations' BBC Trust . It found that freelance reporter Angus Stickler, who took the story to the programme, was considered a ‘safe pair of hands’ and may have been subjected to ‘lighter-touch editorial checks’ than if he had been less well-known to the BBC. It said the report was wrongly treated as if it had two sources - Mr Messham, and an interview with a second victim broadcast on BBC Five Live in 2000, who could not be contacted. ‘The Trustees agreed that members of the Newsnight team were wrong to regard this as a report with two sources, given that the second witness could not be found. ‘The Trustees found it particularly concerning that, at no point in advance of the broadcast of the Newsnight report, was Mr Messham shown a photograph of Lord McAlpine and asked to confirm that he was the individual at the centre of the allegations.’ It found that, although Lord McAlpine had denied the allegations when contacted by Channel 4 News journalist Michael Crick ahead of the broadcast of the Newsnight programme, the BBC still made no attempt to contact the peer, which it should have done. Elsewhere: The report over the botched investigation, published today, coincided with the Pollard Review into why a Newsnight investigation into broadcaster and DJ Jimmy Savile (pictured) was shelved . Trustees also said that concerns had been raised previously about the credibility of some of Mr Messham's evidence - which was known to members of BBC Wales, but no effort was made to contact them. ‘The Trustees considered that parts of . BBC News not contacting colleagues in the nations and regions when . investigating stories on their patch was very poor practice.’ 'The Trustees were clear that there was a failure of editorial control within the BBC; this was a high-risk report which required rigorous supervision and did not receive it' BBC Trust . They also noted that the failure came in the wake of the decision not to run the Savile Newsnight programme in December 2011 and said that situation led to a ‘lack of clarity concerning who had overall editorial responsibility for the content of the Newsnight report’. They said: ‘Concern about possible reputational damage in that event ""played too large a part"" in the decision to proceed with the broadcast.’ The committee found there was a lack of clarity in who had final editorial sign-off. They added: ‘The Trustees were clear that there was a failure of editorial control within the BBC; this was a high-risk report which required rigorous supervision and did not receive it.’ An Ofcom spokesman said: ‘Ofcom's investigation into the Newsnight child sex abuse allegations is currently ongoing. We will make the outcome of this investigation known in due course.’","Broadcast was a 'grave .

'There is ridiculous drama this season. Andy is a chief, he's a schweff who likes girls more than his mates. Made in Chelsea star Jamie Laing says newcomer Lucy is a 'b***h' and Andy values girls over his friends . Jamie found it hilarious that Lucy ditched him for friend and co-star Andy Jordan . 'As much as I was annoyed that she rejected me, Lucy is a b***h who doesn't care what people think of her, she's hilarious. 'The situation between us is pretty bad as you'll see tonight. We're not mates, she doesn't like me,' he told MailOnline. The 22-year-old reality TV star has had his fair share of love interests on the show and avid fans will remember his love predicament with Binky earlier this season. After she announced that she will be buying her former flame a 'Guilty Pour Homme' fragrance for Christmas, Jamie feels nothing but remorse. Jamie says he accepts that he didn't treat Binky well and has bought her a 'sweet' Christmas present to make up for it . 'I think it's fair enough that she's buying me that; I deserve it. I've already got her present. Let's just say it's very sweet and you put it on your keys,' he said. The star, who will be spending Christmas at home in Gloucestershire, is jetting off for some winter sun in Barbados with co-star and best friend Ollie Proudlock for the New Year. 'We've been to Barbados together before with Francis too but he is playing polo or something this time so can't come. Jamie will be moving in with Proudlock, Francis and Spencer who he nicknames 'the pug' 'It's going to be so fun, partying and hanging out with girls on the beach.' The three boys have as much off-screen rapport as on-screen and have spent the last year living together. 'I have had the most fun I've ever had in my life living with the boys this year and it is so upsetting that we have to move out of the house but we are looking for somewhere new and are going to take the plunge and live with Spencer too, it's going to be awesome,' he said.

Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles could soon be built in oil-rich Saudi Arabia as Middle Eastern demand for the luxury British-made vehicles grows. The £1bn plan follows Jaguar Land Rover sales in the Middle East and North Africa increasing by more than 9per cent to 11,418 vehicles this year. The move forms part of the car company's global expansion strategy that recently saw it complete a £1bn deal to build its vehicles in China. One of the biggest car manufacturers in the UK, Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India-based Tata Motors, also plans to create an additional 4,500 production and manufacturing jobs in the UK over the next five years. In demand: Sales of Jaguar Land Rover vehicles to the Middle East and North Africa have increased by more than 9 per cent to 11,418 vehicles so far this year . Hope for growth: Prime Minister David Cameron visited Jaguar Land Rover in Solihull earlier this week and highlighted the need for more engineers, mechanics and scientists to boost Britain's economy . Jaguar Land Rover chief executive Dr . Speth said: ‘We are committed to further international partnerships to . meet record demand for our highly sought after vehicles. 'The Kingdom of . Saudi Arabia is an attractive potential development option, . complementing our existing advanced facilities in Britain and recent . manufacturing plans to expand in other countries including India and .

Steve Fowler, editor-in-chief of motoring magazine Auto Express said; ‘This is a brilliant deal in the desert for Jaguar Land Rover. It’s a massive coup. And it could prove to be a masterstroke.’ Mr Fowler  said: ’Everyone is concentrating on emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil. But an awful lot of luxury cars are also  sold in the Middle East and it’s a growing market. It could be very lucrative. The deal would present an opportunity for British workers to head out to Saudi Arabia to train local staff, although the company stresses it is not 'exporting British jobs abroad'. Last month the firm announced that Jaguars and Land Rovers are to be built in China for the first time ever following a £1billion joint-venture deal with China’s sixth largest car-manufacturer Chery.

No bail: Amber Hilberling, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, is accused of pushing husband Joshua, through a window after he threatened to leave her less than a year into their marriage . A heavily pregnant newlywed accused of killing her Air Force husband by pushing him out of a 17th floor window has been denied bail. Amber Hilberling, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, allegedly defenestrated husband Joshua, after he threatened to leave her less than a year into their marriage. She was arrested soon after the incident in June 2011 and released on $250,000 bail. But in January she was jailed for . breaking her bond conditions after testing positive for marijuana and . repeatedly failing to recharge her electronic tracking tag. Mr Hilberling fell from the 115 . metre University Club tower building where they lived on to a parking . garage below - and when 19-year-old wife Amber was later arrested she is . said to have admitted that she pushed him. Amber, who was more than seven months . pregnant at the time, denies second-degree murder, insisting he fell by . accident, blaming the apartment's operator for installing dangerously thin glass in the building. Amber is said to have been escorted . from the building shortly afterwards, where she 'made statements to . witnesses that she pushed the victim and that caused him to fall through . the window,' according to the police report. The couple had a history of domestic . violence, according to court records, but 'it depends on what side of . the family you talk to as to who is the more aggressive one,' Sergeant . Dave Walker said at the time. Happier times: The couple married in August 2010 in Wichita Falls in Texas after graduating from Victory Christian High School, where he was a star football player . A month before his death, Mr . Hilberling filed a protective order against his wife but the case was . dismissed after neither turned up for the court hearing, according to . True Crime Report. Mr Hilberling had written in an . official statement that his wife had taken a floor lamp and . 'pushed/threw the lamp at me and busted me in the head.' He was taken to hospital after the incident and had to have ten staples and 11 stitches put in to close the wound on his head, he had claimed. Plunge: Mr Hilberling fell from the 115 metre University Club Tower building where they lived on to a parking garage below . Mr Hilberling's parents said their son had tried to work through the domestic problems with his wife. 'I think that’s why he stayed with Amber as long as he did, because he thought he could fix it,” Patrick Hilberling told Tulsa World. Ambitions: Joshua was discharged from the Air Force and moved back to Tulsa in May 2010, where he was set to study to become a registered nurse (pictured together) 'When I saw the (Tulsa Police Department) Chaplain, I knew she killed him. She finally did it.' Jeanne Hilberling described her son as 'just a sweet boy.' 'He’s always willing to help others,' she said. 'He would help others and neglect himself. He always had a smile and witty sense of humour. 'Writing on a Facebook memorial group, she added: 'He was trying to leave her. He called his dad at 3:30 and said his bags were packed - he couldn't take anymore. 'She charged him with all her insanity strength and pushed him out the window. He fell 17 stories and landed on the 8th floor parking garage. 'She admitted at the scene that she pushed him - no remorse - nothing. Even smiled at the by standers.'

The female CIA agent credited with tracking down Osama bin Laden was passed over for promotion amid widespread jealousy among her colleagues over her part in finding the terror mastermind. The agent also came under investigation for meeting with the makers of the Hollywood film 'Zero Dark Thirty' which chronicles the hunt for the al Qaeda leader. According to The Washington Post, she has been at the center of controversy during the promotion of the film, and one of the clearest examples came after an email was sent announcing that she won an award and dozens of her colleagues were given less prestigious recognition. That was too much for her to bare. She reportedly sent an email essentially saying: 'You guys tried to obstruct me. You fought me. Only I deserve the award,' and sent it to the entire agency. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . CIA: The film focuses on, Maya, the 'wicked smart' female CIA agent played by actress Jessica Chastain who was obsessed with catching and killing bin Laden, pictured . She met with scriptwriter Mark Boal to . talk about her role in tracking bin Laden to his hideout in Pakistan, . which lead to the terror mastermind's May 2011 death. A US Navy SEAL team shot dead bin Laden in May 2011 after a stealth raid on his compound in Pakistan. In . the aftermath of the successful raid a female agent was given much of . the credit for refusing to give up in the 10 year manhunt. It was her persistence that led to bin Laden finally being tracked down by agents by following one of his trusted couriers. The female agent, who is in her 30s, has never been named and still works for the spy agency in a counter terrorism unit. Women of the film: Chastain plays the lead . character (left) and said that she knew the film would be politically . controversial, while director Kathryn Bigelow (right) said that the . torture scenes were the hardest to film . But following the death of bin Laden, The Washington Post reports that she was widely expected to get promotion - only to be passed over. The agent is said to have angered many of her colleagues by sending out an email saying they did not deserve the same accolades as her for finding bin Laden. Although she was given a cash award for her work on finding bin Laden missing out on promotion is said to have cost her a rise of $16,000 a year. Integral: The real-life agent who spearheaded the raid is reportedly furious that other agents- who she feels slowed down the progress of the search- were given awards for their work . Propaganda: Osama bin Laden -- watching Barack Obama on television in Pakistan before he died . A profile of the agent in The Washington . Post said many of her colleagues were envious of the attention she . received from Hollywood. Star: Many in the CIA are reportedly envious of how the female agent is getting so much credit for the assassination of Bin Laden . 'She’s not Miss Congeniality, but that’s not going to find Osama bin Laden,' said a former CIA associate. Other colleagues said she had been treated harshly and had come under suspicion of cooperating too closely with the makers of Zero Dark Thirty, which opens in the U.S. on December 19th. The film has been tipped for Oscar success and has already won a host of critics awards. It is also mired in controversy with the opening scenes showing terror suspects being waterboarded and US politicians complaining that director Kathryn Bigelow was given too much access. The role of the female CIA agent is played by Jessica Chastain and has the fictional name of 'Maya'. The film shows her dogged pursuit of bin Laden and challenging superiors who doubted he would ever be found. A spokesman for the CIA refused to talk about the agent but said many people were involved in the hunt for bin Laden. Spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood said: 'Over the course of a decade, hundreds of analysts, operators and many others played key roles in the hunt.' The film's director Kathryn Bigelow has been quick to dole out praise to the unidentified agent, however. 'With her tenacity, her courage and her dedication, really drove that lead forward and gave it a lot of traction and the interesting thing about the movie is it puts you in her shoes,' Bigelow said during an appearance on CBS' This Morning. The Navy SEAL who wrote the controversial book detailing the assassination of Osama bin Laden credits a 'feisty' female CIA analyst for leading them to their target, after spending five years hunting him. Author Matt Bissonnette – whose identity was revealed even though he wrote the tell-all book under the pen name of  Mark Owen – only refers to the woman using the pseudonym ‘Jen’ in his book. Same inspiration? Claire Danes' character Carrie Mathison is thought to be based on the female agent who lead the search for Osama bin Laden, and she is also at the center of the upcoming film Zero Dark Thirty . The similarities between her backstory and that of the lead character in the hit television series Homeland are obvious. 'I can't give her enough credit,' he said during the interview. 'I mean, she, in my opinion, she kind of teed up this whole thing.' In his book, Bissonnette writes that he sat next to the woman during one of the long-haul flights as they headed to Pakistan for the mission, and his brief description paints a picture of a young and extremely dedicated analyst. 'Recruited by the agency out of college, she'd been working on the Bin Laden task force for the last five years. Analysts rotated in and out of the task force, but she stayed and kept after it. 'After the al-Kuwaiti phone call, she'd worked to put all the pieces together... she had been our go-to analyst on all intelligence questions regarding the target,' he writes. Even though the fact that the CIA is dominated by men is well-documented, it may be too quick to assume that the same ‘wicked smart, kind of feisty’ agent that Bissonnette wrote about was the basis for the lead character in the Golden Globe-winning series Homeland. However, actress Claire Danes hinted at a connection during an interview about the research she did to prepare for her role as Carrie Mathison. 'There’s a woman Carrie is loosely modeled on and she’s a CIA officer and so I met with her and she took me to Langley and introduced me to some of her colleagues,' Danes told The Wall Street Journal. The Homeland protagonist is described as being stubborn, headstrong, and outspoken. The same appears true for the female agent. 'Jen wasn't afraid to share her opinion with even the highest officers,' Bissonnette wrote in the book. 'This was her baby. Jen and her team spent five years tracking him to get us where we were now.' --- Meghan Keneally . WATCH THE TRAILER HERE .","Female CIA agent serves as basis for upcoming film Zero Dark Thirty .

Spain was accused of an 'act of war' today after its naval ships repeatedly entered the territorial waters of Gibraltar. Bob Stewart, Tory MP for Beckenham, said the British Government needed to 'respond robustly to this aggravation' after Commons Leader Andrew Lansley said two Spanish naval vessels entered the waters of Gibraltar on Monday. He said they were given radio warnings before leaving but Mr Stewart, a former colonel, said the incursion was illegal and the Government needed to 'do something about it'. Two Spanish naval vessels entered the waters of Gibraltar on Monday in what has been branded an 'act of war' The Spanish boats swiftly left the area after they were radioed and the Government said it was dealing with the situation 'through diplomatic means' Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Foreign Secretary William Hague should update the Commons with a statement, he said. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Stewart told MPs: 'May I gently remind the House that an illegal incursion into British Gibraltarian sovereign waters is actually, technically an act of war? 'What is happening at the moment is wrong and we should do something about it. MP Bob Stewart said the British Government needed to 'respond robustly to this aggravation' 'Can I ask for an urgent statement by . the Secretary of State for Defence and the Secretary of State for . Foreign Affairs to actually respond robustly to this aggravation?' His comments came after his Tory colleague Andrew Rosindell, MP for Romford, said Spain needed to be stopped immediately. In his question to Mr Lansley, he said: 'I am sure the entire House will be shocked, angered and dismayed at the continual incursions by the Spanish government into the waters around the British sovereign territory of Gibraltar. 'This is an act of aggression and will you ask the Secretary of State for Defence and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to make a statement about what Her Majesty's Government will do to ensure these illegal incursions into British sovereign waters are stopped forthwith?' The Commons Leader said the Government had protested to Spain through diplomatic channels. He told Mr Rosindell: 'I can tell you there were two incursions by Spanish naval vessels into British Gibraltar territorial waters on December 10. 'Radio warnings were issued and the vessels departed from those waters. We have protested to Spain via diplomatic channels. 'The Royal Navy challenges Guardia . Civil and other Spanish state vessels whenever they make unlawful . incursions into British Gibraltar territorial waters and we will back . those up by making formal diplomatic protests to the Spanish government. Tension: This image shows the territorial waters surrounding Gibraltor . On guard: The Ministry of Defence in Gibraltar issued a statement saying HMS Sutherland was conducting 'routine maritime security patrols' The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major source of tension between the UK and Spain. Both in 1967 and 2002, the people of Gibraltar rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty. Yet, despite this, Spain still asserts a claim to the territory. The tension began in 1704 when an Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltor from Spain during the war of the Spanish succession. The territory was then ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Historically, it has proved to be an important base for the Royal Navy. Now, its economy is based on tourism, financial services and shipping. Under the 2006 constitution of Gibraltar, the territory governs its own affairs although defence and foreign relations are still the responsibility of the UK Government. Located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres. 'They will make clear that such incursions are an unacceptable violation of British sovereignty.' Yesterday, Royal Navy warship HMS Sutherland used a routine visit to Gibraltar to patrol British waters around the Rock. The . Ministry of Defence in Gibraltar issued a statement saying HMS . Sutherland was conducting 'routine maritime security patrols'. Supporting the warship was one of its Merlin helicopters, which flew over the waters in a clear signal to the Spanish navy. The ship had been due to stop in Gibraltar after conducting anti-piracy patrols in the Indian Ocean but received orders to make its patrol as a message to Spain. In a written parliamentary question earlier this week, Mr Rosindell discovered that the number of incursions had spiked this year. Responding to the question, Defence Minister Andrew Robathan said there were 67 instances in 2010 and another 23 last year. But from the beginning of January to the end of November this year there had been 197 occasions when Spanish ships had sailed into the waters of Gibraltar.

The UK and the U.S. today refused to sign the first UN telecommunications treaty of the Internet age, claiming it would lead to greater government control of cyberspace. They were among a group of 20 nations which walked away from negotiations in Dubai after an ideological split over the nature of the Internet and who is responsible for its growth and governance. Rival countries - including Iran, China and African states - insisted governments should have a greater sway over Internet affairs and sought to break the Western grip on information technology. Scroll down for video . Summit: Delegates at the ITUtalks in Dubai listen to Hamadoun Toure, the group's secretary-general. The UK and U.S. today led a bloc of 20 nations which refused to sign the accords . They also favoured greater international help to bring reliable online links to the world's least developed regions. In a testament to the contentious atmosphere at the negotiations of the UN's International Telecommunications Union, the pages of reservations and comments by various countries involved were longer than the treaty itself. In the end, it was supported by 89 countries in the 193-member union. Fifty-five did not sign, including the U.S.-led bloc of more than 20 nations, and others needing home country approval. The remainder did not have high-ranking envoys in Dubai. The ITU - which dates to the age of the telegraph in the mid-19th century - has no technical powers to change how the Internet operates or force countries to follow its non-binding accords, which also dealt with issues such as mobile phone roaming rates and international emergency numbers. But the U.S. and its backers nevertheless worried that the new treaty could alter the tone of debates about the Internet. Instead of viewing it as a free-form network, they claim, it could increasingly been seen as a commodity that needs clear lines of oversight. Hamadoun Toure, the group's . secretary-general, said he was 'very much surprised' by the U.S.-led . snub after days of difficult negotiations that dropped or softened . wording that troubled the West. Yet . it fell short of American-led demands that all references to the . Internet - even indirect or couched in general language - be omitted. Breakdown in communications: Mr Toure, left, said said he was very much surprised by the snub after days of difficult negotiations had softened or dropped wording that had troubled U.S. delegate Terry Kramer, right . Even apparently clear-cut issues such as unsolicited email 'spam' brought division. Efforts to try to address blanket electronic message barrages was seen by American envoys and others as something governments could use as possible U.N. cover for increased surveillance on email traffic. 'Fundamental divides were exposed,' said Lynn St. Amour, CEO and president of the Internet Society, an industry group. Internet restrictions and availability at selected countries and regions around the world: . Internet use is extremely restricted with many of North Korea's 24million people unable to get online. Some North Koreans can access an internal Intranet that connects to state media. Members of the elite, resident foreigners and visitors in certain hotels are allowed full access. Most Western social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter are blocked in Iran, as well as political opposition and sexually explicit websites. But proxy server sites and other methods are widely used to get around the official restrictions. There are more than 500 million Chinese online but they contend with an extensive Internet filtering and censorship system popularly known as the 'Great Fire Wall.' Censors police blogs and domestic social media for content deemed pornographic or politically subversive and delete it. Tight control, slow connections and high costs mean only around 5 percent of Cubans have access to the global Internet, with another 23 percent relying instead on a government intranet with very limited content. Web access is mainly via public facilities where people must first register with identification. Internet censorship is prevalent across former Soviet Central Asian republics, but the strongest restrictions have been recorded in Iran's authoritarian neighbours to the north, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The government restricts access to the Internet and closely monitors online communications. The U.S. State Department's latest human rights report said the government monitored email without obtaining warrants as required by law, and that all Internet users were required to use one of three service providers owned directly by the government or controlled by members of the country's sole party. Mr Toure framed it as clash of 'two societies'; a so-called digital divide with citizens of wealthy countries able to access the Net on one side, and 4.5 billion others in poor nations on the other. 'We are defending here the right to communicate as a basic human right. That's something very important in the ITU. We so remind our members constantly of that obligation,' he told reporters. He also said there was no specific endorsement of 'Internet control or Internet governance.' Still the dissident nations said the general acknowledgement of a government stake in 21st century telecommunications was just as troubling as any specific wording. 'Internet policy should not be determined by member states, but by citizens, communities and broader society ... the private sector and civil society,' Terry Kramer, head of the U.S. delegation, told the gathering late last night. 'That has not happened here.' Mr Toure today said it was impossible and illogical to ignore the Net. 'If the word Internet was used frequently here in Dubai, it is simply a reflection of the reality of the modern world,' said Mr Toure, a Russian-trained engineer from Mali. 'Telecommunication networks are not just used for making voice calls, so our two worlds are linked.' Overshadowed by the Internet showdowns were other details in the pact. They include agreements that could lower mobile phone roaming charges, pledges to invest more communications infrastructure in poorer countries, efforts for greater communication technology for the disabled and a move to create a common emergency number for mobile phones and other devices. Either the 911 or 112 number will be picked in later talks. It's unclear whether countries that rejected the pact could benefit from possible changes such as lower roaming rates when the accord takes effect in 2015. 'Some really good stuff' in the accord, said a Twitter post by .nxt, a website following Internet policy. But it said the disputes over possible Internet controls forced the U.S and others 'to bail' out on the deal.","U.S. led group of 20 nations which walked away from the treaty .

Britain's first property rental ASBO is set to be handed down to a slum landlord who leased rotting homes and bedsits strewn with rubbish to vulnerable people. David McCabe, 57, a landlord for 30 years, was fined £28,000 for 28 counts of . breaching housing regulations and failing to clean up two of his homes, . which he had split into six bedsits. Plymouth Magistrates Court heard how the homes and bedsits were strewn with rubbish, the bathrooms dilapidated and the carpets and walls covered in dirt. Floors of his properties were rotting, there were inadequate fire alarms and fire-fighting equipment, and the back gardens and yards were cluttered with tyres, furniture and timber. Some of the windows and doors of his homes were also seized shut. McCabe, of Plymouth, Devon, leased rooms with only basic furniture, and sometimes not even a bed to vulnerable people on benefits - many with alcohol problems, it was said. Plymouth City Council also launched a pioneering legal application for an Anti-Social Behaviour Order which would stop him renting rooms to anyone on housing benefit. Speaking in court council lawyer Helen Morris said the two houses were 'in a state of Dickensian squalor'. She said: 'They did not meet modern housing standards. These are vulnerable tenants on very limited means. 'The council tried to work with him for many years and he is brought before court as a last resort.' Filth: A stained and dirty sink at a Plymouth property rented by McCabe who was found guilty of allowing tenants to live in Dickensian squalor . Beware of the mice: Mouse droppings in the sink at one of McCabe's properties . Rotten: Plymouth Magistrates Court heard how the bathrooms were dilapidated and the floors rotten . McCabe denied two allegations of failing to comply with improvement notices from the city council ordering him to carry out work at the homes. He also denied 26 counts of failing to comply with regulations on the homes, which had been converted to bedsits for five or six tenants. But magistrates found him guilty on all 28 counts and he was fined £1,000 for each. McCabe must also pay £4,500 towards the council's costs. Mrs Morris said McCabe had been issued with improvement notices to repair and refurbish both of the properties. But she added an inspection in March found 26 breaches of housing regulations. McCabe dismissed some of the complaints as 'petty', saying officers had enlarged photographs of damage and dirt so they seemed much larger. He said he could not be expected to be aware of 'minor' problems unless tenants reported them. McCabe blamed some of the problems on tenants doing their own makeshift repairs or deliberately causing damage. He added he would provide a cooker and a fridge in their rooms but not always a bed. A fresh hearing is to be held next month to hear the council's application for an ASBO, which is understood to be the first of its kind in the country. Cllr Chris Penberthy, the city council's cabinet member for Cooperatives and Community Development, said after the case: 'We work with landlords and landlords' representatives and the majority do keep their properties in good order. 'They expect us to take action against poor landlords who undermine their reputation and that of the private rented sector generally.'

They may not look very threatening, but an invasion of Giant African Land Snails is causing havoc in parts of Florida. The slimy creatures, which are native to East Africa, cause widespread damage to crops and buildings, while some carry thousands of 'rat lungworms' which can cause meningitis if ingested by humans. Government officials battling to stem the tide have collected more than 40,000 of the snails since they were first found in the south of the state late last year. Threat: Giant African Land Snails like this one can carry thousands of worms which, if ingested, may cause meningitis in humans . Large numbers of the snails, which can grow up to eight inches in length and more than four inches in width, have also infested parts of South and Central America. Parasitic Rat lungworms use the snails as hosts. After a rat eats an infected snail, thousands of the worms - up to 60mm long - may grow in its brain. If a human ingests a snail infected by the worms they can reach the brain, causing eosinophilic meningitis. Symptoms can include headaches, numbness and spasms and in the most serious cases - death. Prolific: State officials face a long battle to rid Florida of the fast-breeding snails . The snails are eaten in parts of . South and Central American. Properly cooked, they are safe to eat, but . they are eaten either raw or partially cooked by some communities.

Worms: Even juvenile snails like this can carry thousands of potentially deadly rat lungworms . The species can live up to nine years, and produce more than a thousand eggs a year. They reach maturity after a year and . can produce 200-300 eggs a month. This leads to enormous infestations over a short time-scale. The snails are listed among the world's top 100 invasive species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

A 'supervolcano' eruption is the most catastrophic natural disaster that can hit our planet, short of an asteroid impact - and now scientists believe they may build up a deadly head of steam far faster than we thought. Instead of the process taking hundreds of thousands of years, it could take just hundreds. The news could be bad for the US, where a supervolcano is said to be simmering beneath Yellowstone National Park. If it erupted, two thirds of the country could be rendered uninhabitable. Eruption: Supervolcanoes with the power to destroy human civilisations may build up a deadly head of steam far faster than scientists believed . Supervolcanoes are fuelled by giant pools of magma that form deep underground. Geologists had thought it took between 100,000 to 200,000 years for a supervolcano magma pool to build up enough pressure to erupt. But the new study suggests that the giant magma bodies may only exist for a few thousand years, or even a few hundred, before exploding. A magma reservoir six miles below Yellowstone has been rising at a record rate since 2004. The Wyoming park sits above a gigantic plume of hot and molten rock that begins at least 400 miles beneath Earth's surface and rises to 30 miles underground, where it widens to about 300 miles across. Blobs of magma occasionally break off from the top of the plume, and rise farther, resupplying the magma chamber beneath the Yellowstone Caldera.

Resembling the lid of a cooking pot, the caldera formed when the last super-eruption occurred 600,000 years ago. The supervolcano has erupted a total of three times in the last 2.1 million years. Scientists believe it could be due to erupt again.A full scale eruption at Yellowstone would be 1,000 times more powerful than the volcanic blast that tore apart Mount St Helens in 1980.There is evidence that a similar super-eruption in Indonesia 74,000 years ago came close to wiping out the entire human species.The new study was based on analysis of a super-eruption that occurred in eastern California 760,000 years ago.Several independent lines of evidence indicated that the magma pool erupted within a few thousand years, perhaps within a few hundred years, covering half the North American continent with smouldering ash.The scientists based their estimate on quartz crystallisation rates. Previous studies have relied on the growth of zircon crystals, which is said to be a less accurate method.The research is published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE.Lead scientist Dr Guilherme Gualda, from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, said: ‘Our study suggests that when these exceptionally large magma pools form they are ephemeral and cannot exist very long without erupting.‘The fact that the process of magma body formation occurs in historical time, instead of geological time, completely changes the nature of the problem.’He said regions such as Yellowstone should be monitored regularly to provide advance warning of a catastrophic super-eruption.","Most deadly event that can hit Earth short of asteroid .

The judge didn't specify exactly where Scott Studer's fine should be directed, only that it go to the Newtown community. ‘I don’t care where that money comes from, but something good is going to come from this very awful situation,’ said Stark County Common Pleas Judge Frank Forchione. Studer, 46, was sentenced after he pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with eight counts of illegal use of a minor in a nudity-oriented material or performance: one count for each of the eight seasons during which the coach spied on his students. He was initially facing up to 64 years in prison. After pleading guilty to each of the counts Studer issued an apology to the victims. ‘I’m so sorry for the bad things that I did. I always talked to my players about trust and respect and family. My bad decisions went against everything that I ever talked about. ‘I wish that I could take it all back and make everything better for them but I can’t. I hope someday they can find it in their hearts to forgive me but I understand if they can’t,’ he said, according to Fox8. Assistant Stark County Prosecutor Chryssa Hartnett read statements from parents and from victims, whose names have not been made public to protect their privacy.

Another letter written by one of Studer's victims said 'Coach Stu' was once his inspiration. 'I thought you were a great man,' the letter stated, 'but now all I see are lies and deceit. You have tainted the program I love and tarnished the memories we all hold most dear.' Judge Forchione ordered the tapes destroyed after two years pending civil lawsuits or appeals. In addition, Studer was banned for life from attending any scholastic or athletic events in Jackson Township and from making any contact with the victims. At least 74 boys have been identified on the secretly recorded videotapes made over the span of eight years, Jackson Township police Lt. Rick Mitchell said Wednesday. He wasn't sure whether more victims might be identified, but authorities have noted in the past that Studer may have been in contact with as many as 112 boys dating back to 2005 when it is believed that the 46-year-old began taping students in the shower. Prosecutors detailed the logistics of Studer's crime, explaining that he would place small cameras 'in a box or a shoe and put them in the locker room, face the shower and put towels over them and adjust them where he would be able to film the victims.' Atonement: Studer has been ordered to give $5,000 to the families of the victims of the school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut . During the investigation, police carefully examined Studer's computers and emails to see if he shared the photos or even discussed them with anyone else, but came to the conclusion that he kept them to himself. The search of Studer's home was led by . the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, which hasn't commented on what led . its investigators to him. ‘I don’t think there’s any question you have a very tortured soul to take advantage of these young men and your penalty will be severe, and not just the penalty of the clanging of the bars when they close but I think you are going to find yourself ostracized from this community forever,’ Judge Forchione told the defendant. The parents of all those who were videotaped and the victims who are now adults have been notified, he said. Mitchell said the community would welcome the resolution of the case. ‘I think the quicker we get it done, the better. Everyone can move on from that point,’ Mitchell said.

Twitter users could soon be able to report emergencies in 140 characters and bypass 999 calls under proposals aimed at making communication with the UK's biggest fire service easier. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has said that it will explore the idea of setting up the world's first 999 emergency feed to ease pressure on the telephone service which takes more than 30million calls a year. The plans, which are part of the Brigade's Draft London Safety Plan, will not replace the 999 system. Help: Twitter users could soon be able to report emergencies in 140 characters or less . But the plans have been slammed by union chiefs who believe that the idea could put lives at risk. Ian Leahair, Fire Brigades Union executive council member for London told the Independent: 'It is a ludicrous idea. 'It will inevitably lead to more hoax calls. They sound like something the London Fire Brigade has just blurted out.' Some Twitter users had already taken to the social networking site to report fires according to the LFB, and fire crews have previously used information and pictures tweeted by members of the public to help tackle emergencies. But fire chiefs have urged people to continue to dial 999 as their Twitter feed @LondonFire is not currently manned around the clock. The service will look at different social media, micro-blogging sites and smart-phone apps as alternatives to the current telephone system. It cites figures from Ofcom that suggest that the number of people talking on the phone is in decline and that 20 per cent of adults now use a smart phone. Emergency: Fire crews could soon come to your aid after a Twitter request for help . Not up and running: Fire chiefs have urged people to continue to dial 999 to report fires as its Twitter feed is not currently manned round the clock (file picture) Rita Dexter, Deputy Commissioner of London Fire Brigade, said: 'With over a billion people now using Facebook and half a billion using Twitter, it’s quite clear that social media is here to stay. 'The London Fire Brigade is the biggest fire service in the country and we think it’s important to look into ways to improve how we communicate with the public and how they can get in touch with us.' New idea: The plans are part of the LFB's Draft London Safety Plan . Although the Brigade has said it will work with other emergency services in London, both the London Ambulance Service and the Metropolitan Police distanced themselves from the idea and said that they have no plans to introduce a similar service. But the LFB said that cynics rubbished the idea of dialling 999 in an emergency when it was first introduced more than seven decades ago. Rita Dexter added: 'When it was first set up in 1935, people said that dialling 999 to report emergencies would never work. 'Today BT handles over 30 million emergency calls each year. 'It’s time to look at new ways for people to report emergencies quickly and efficiently and social media could provide the answer in the future.' The LFB currently uses Twitter to give real-time updates on developing incidents and Facebook to offer fire prevention and safety advice to Londoners. The plan will be subject to a public consultation next month. According to Twitter, 2,000 messages are sent per second worldwide.","The UK's largest brigade to look at alternatives to 999 .

She's tipped to play Anastasia Steele in the upcoming film adaptation of EL James' Fifty Shades of Grey, and has even admitted she'd be excited to take on the role. And to give us a sneak peek of how she might look in the on-screen trilogy, British actress Felicity Jones, 29, has undergone a dramatic, wintry make-over. The petite star of Like Crazy and Chalet Girl - who is also the face of Dolce & Gabbana make-up - took part in a photo shoot for InStyle magazine with make-up artist Dele Olo. Christmas pout: Felicity Jones sports thick lashes - courtesy of make-up artist Dele Olo - and her natural show-stopping pout in the InStyle shoot . Admitting that she's 'always loved Sixties French films and Brigitte Bardot', the tiny Londoner channeled the Gallic beauty with ethereal make-up accentuating her enormous green eyes and bee-sting lips. Jones, who lives in east London with her artist boyfriend Ed Fornieles, began acting as a child with a starring role in the TV adaptation of Jill Murphy's The Worst Witch. She went on to play Emma Carter in The Archers on Radio Four's, while also finding time to complete a degree in English at Oxford University. Talking about her make-up routine, the actress - who says her favourite look is 'a strong eye and nude glossy lip' - explained: 'I use SPF every day, then apply foundation, mascara, eyeliner and blusher. I always take my make-up off at night and moisturise.' WATCH A BEHIND-THE-SCENES VIDEO OF FELICITY JONES' INSTYLE PHOTO SHOOT .

'Lashes are a fun way to play with texture, . whether you go for natural, coloured or dramatic ones. Before you apply them, dust a soft wash of . shimmery peach eyeshadow [Olo used Dolce & Gabbana The Make Up's . Animalier Collection] over the lid and do the same once the glue has . dried to create a seamless finish. For the lips, mix balm and gloss for . hydration and subtle shine.' Tip: if you don’t like wearing falsies, load up on at least four coats of mascara. BOLD BROWS . 'Big, . defined brows really complement these looks. They perfectly . frame the fluttery lashes and give the metallic textures and dewy skin . more of an edge. Once you’ve applied your foundation, take a clean . cotton bud over your brows to remove any residue. Next, brush up your . brows to help locate any sparse areas, then take an eyebrow pencil in . the same colour as your brows to fill in any gaps.' Tip: Use soft, . feathery strokes and a clear setting gel to keep your brows in place. PLATINUM EYES . 'A . strong eye and nude lip is very Sixties, but this has a modern feel . thanks to the textures. Blend a powder eyeshadow over the entire lid, . take the colour up over the crease, out into a wing shape, then down . along the lower lash line. You can enhance the colour by applying cream . eyeshadow over the top. For the lips, use a creamy nude lipstick, then . add lots of clear gloss. Tip: 'Match your manicure to your pout with high-shine nude nails,' says shoot manicurist Kim Treacy. SHEENY SKIN . 'This . look is so pretty and fresh for this time of year, as it prevents . winter skin looking dull and flat. It isn't about creating a tan, it's . about adding shimmer and iridescence.

Twin NASA satellites are due for a cosmic collision of sorts Monday after concluding a 15-month mission to map the gravity signature of Earth's nearest neighbor. Scientists last week set the Grail spacecraft, named Ebb and Flow, respectively, on course for a crash-landing into a lunar crater near the moon's north pole. But don't expect to see any sky-borne flashes, as Ebb and Flow are, as one researcher put it, 'washer-and-dryer-size spacecraft with empty fuel tanks.' Scroll down for video . Ebb and Flow Satellites crash into moon . Heavenly bodies: An artist's depiction of the twin spacecraft (Ebb and Flow) that comprise NASA's Gravity Recovery And Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission. 'We're not expecting a flash that is visible from Earth,' Grail Principal Investigator Maria Zuber told Space.com. The two satellites are reportedly about to run out of fuel, and were guided to the location to avoid an estimated 1-in-8 million chance they could plunge into a historically important part of the moon, like where the Apollo astronauts landed. Blast Off: The $496 million Grail mission - short for Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory - launched in September 2011, and Ebb and Flow reportedly arrived in lunar orbit about three months later. They are scheduled to hurtle into the crater at 3,760 miles-per-hour 20 seconds apart at 5:28 p.m. mission team members told Space.com. 'They're going to be completely blown apart,' Grail mission manager David Lehman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif reportedly said. Added Zuber: 'This is all according to plan.' The $496 million Grail mission — short for Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory — launched in September 2011, and Ebb and Flow reportedly arrived in lunar orbit about three months later. Grail's primary science mission ran from March to May, during which the spacecraft zipped around the moon at an average altitude of 34 miles. Ebb and Flow dropped down to about 14 miles above the moon for an extended phase. And the mission was - by all accounts - a success. 'Grail has produced the highest-resolution, highest-quality gravity field for any planet in the solar system, including Earth,' Zuber reportedly said. The resulting map has revealed an incredibly pulverized lunar crust, Zuber added, suggesting that the moon, Earth, Mars, Mercury and Venus were pounded by long-ago impacts far more violently than previously thought. Mission managers on Friday turned off Ebb and Flow's science instruments and ordered a maneuver putting them  on course for the rim of the crater, which reportedly sits at a latitude of 75.62 degrees north and a longitude of 26.63 degrees east.

A Nazi stalker obsessed with a woman who turned him down, sent his victim bullets in the post during a four-year reign of terror. Daniel Coleman made a mocked-up video of the woman and her sister being beheaded with an axe and shot in the head, then sent it to their mother. Coleman, from Derby, also threw a brick at the woman's window with a note tied to it saying he would 'slaughter her like a pig'. Daniel Coleman, left, set up a fake Facebook account under the name Theodore Robert Cowell, the real name of the American serial killer Ted Bundy, right . Photographs were found of the 28-year-old dressed in a Nazi uniform and holding a gun when police raided his home. Derby Crown Court heard that Coleman had 'a preoccupation with Germany, Austria and National Socialism'. Coleman began the terrifying harassment after the girl rejected his advances and told him she did not want a relationship with him. In return he daubed the victim's name across the Odeon cinema, where she worked in Derby, and her house, calling her 'a dirty whore'. Coleman was discharged by the army following a court conviction when he was a teenager. Judge John Aucott handed Coleman a four-and-a-half year sentence after he pleaded guilty to harassment and gave him a lifelong restraining order banning him from contacting the girl and her family. The judge said: 'You are not mad, you are bad. You did this for your own satisfaction and gratification. 'You subjected this poor girl and her family to persistent harassment for a number of years leaving her in a state of fear and constant nervousness. 'It says a lot for their character, and not yours, that they were able to function as a family at all. In 14 years this is the first time I have handed anyone who has come before me the maximum sentence I am allowed to.' In 2006, Daniel Coleman was jailed for smashing headstones in Derby's Jewish Cemetery . Coleman was discharged by the Army following a court conviction when he was a teenager.David Outterside, prosecuting, said Coleman was jailed in 2006, along with another defendant, after smashing headstones at Derby's Jewish Cemetery. On his release, in 2008, he met the woman, who was in her early 20s at the time. Mr Outterside said: 'He told her he . wanted a relationship with her but she said she didn't want to. The . following day a brick was thrown at the window of the rented property . where she lived with two friends. 'It . smashed one part of the double-glazed window and the brick was found on . the lawn of the front garden with a note tied around it. It said ""I . will slaughter you all like pigs."" 'A . week later an envelope was found in the garden of the same property . with a rifle bullet inside. On the envelope was written ""I have a bullet . for each of you.""' Five days later Coleman set up a fake Facebook account under the name Theodore Robert Cowell, which Mr Outterside said was the real name of the American serial killer Ted Bundy. Coleman was arrested and sent back to prison to serve the remaining half of his sentence for the criminal damage to the headstones. On his release in March 2010 he began terrorising the victim again. At Derby Crown Court, Judge John Aucott handed Coleman a four-and-a-half year sentence and gave him a lifelong restraining order banning him from contacting the woman and her family . In May 2010 he daubed the name of the . woman, calling her 'a dead bitch', in three feet high writing at the . Odeon cinema and at the house where she lived. She left the property, which belonged to her mother, and new tenants moved in. A letter addressed by Coleman to his victim was delivered to the house. It read: 'Get out or I will firebomb your house.' Then, in January last year, they were sent two DVDs containing photographs of the victim and her sister altered to make it appear as if they had suffered gun and knife wounds. Mr Outterside said: 'He has a preoccupation with Germany, Austria and National Socialism. 'One photograph the police found showed him wearing an army uniform and holding a firearm.' Julia King, for Coleman, said: 'It is an appalling catalogue of incidents but there was no actual violence.' Speaking after the hearing DC Andy Hulland, who worked on the investigation, said: 'The family are absolutely overjoyed at the length of the sentence the judge has handed out. 'They have been through a dramatic ordeal and it is a testament to them that they have handled themselves with such dignity during this time. I don't think anyone who has come across Coleman sees him as anything other than a nasty piece of work.'","Daniel Coleman, 28, also daubed offensive graffiti on her house .

This means that bathers are separated from the sea by several hundred yards of sand at low tide. The sea front provides views of shipping traffic entering and leaving the Humber for the ports of Grimsby, Immingham, Hull and Goole. The main shopping area is St Peter's Avenue. Two large fortifications known as the Humber Forts are visible in the mouth of the river. On a clear day, the lighthouse situated on Spurn Point can be seen with the naked eye from the North Beach.

An increasing number of millionaires long to leave the UK, citing warm weather as the main attraction of foreign shores. Nearly a quarter of Britons worth £1million or more are considering leaving the country in the next two years, a survey by Lloyds TSB International found. Nearly two thirds said the British climate was the main reason why they wished to emigrate, whilst only 41 per cent mentioned taxes. For the climate: More millionaires want to leave the UK - and apparently it is warmer weather they are looking for . The proportion of millionaires ready to pack their bags, 22 per cent, is an increase by three per cent on last year's result. Half of millionaires were concerned about crime and 45 per cent said the cost of living was too high for them to remain in the country. But concerns about tax have subsided, with a four per cent drop since March this year. Of the countries the wealthy would like to move to, France topped the list, followed by Spain, the US, Australia and New Zealand. However, 64 per cent of the wealthy Britons said they were happy living in the UK. Craving Cote d'Azur: Most millionaires looking to up sticks wanted to go to France . Better infrastructure topped the list of things British millionaires said would make the UK a more attractive place to live. Improving public services and cutting red tape for businesses were next on the wish list, followed by tax cuts. Lloyds TSB international director Richard Musty said: 'Wealthy Britons are increasingly considering emigrating, not necessarily for financial reasons, but because they feel their quality of life may be better elsewhere. 'We are seeing this in our client base too, with France, Spain and America increasingly popular locations to settle in. 'This could be part of a wider trend towards globalisation and a more outward-looking way of life for many rich people.'","Nearly a quarter of UK millionaires want to emigrate .

It's all there - the smell of burning coal, the hissing of the steam and the clanking of the wheels as an engine is shunted back and forth. But this is no 1930s fantasy. It's Baker Street station - and it's all happening in the here and now. For the first time in more than 100 years, a steam train was carrying passengers on the Tube yesterday. Scroll down for video .

In a test run for London Underground's 150-year anniversary celebrations, a restored original locomotive hauled a Victorian first-class carriage from Earl's Court to Moorgate. Billowing clouds through the capital's oldest tunnels, the weekend's recreation followed some of the route of the world's first underground railway journey in 1863.

It was a novelty that thousands of Londoners were eager to experience for themselves and to admire what one newspaper called 'the most stupendous engineering undertaking yet achieved in the railway world'. And as on the very first journey in the 19th century, railwaymen, enthusiasts and a few dignitaries were aboard the train and riding inside the restored Metropolitan 353 carriage in the small hours of yesterday morning. The train was built in 1898 and withdrawn from the tracks in 1963. 1898 . Built in 1898, Met Loco No. 1 is the only survivor of a class of seven engines designed by the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Met, Mr T. F.

She was a cleaner on the locomotive at Neasden, north west London, for thirteen years from 1950 to 1963. She told MailOnline: 'We used to have good fun when we were cleaning, especially the interiors. 'There were two to each cart in the afternoon and when you finished your cart, you would help the couple next door to you and carry on until you reached the end of the train. 'We used to have laughs and sing alongs. Sometimes we would tell stories. 'They were happy those days at Neasden.One of the best. 'Perhaps when I was cleaning the windows I used to burst into song myself. I like the Beatles. 'On New Years' night we would gather in the canteen and sing and eat and I would play the piano. At midnight we would sound the hooter (steam trumpet) in the driver's cab - everyone would on all the different lines.' Mrs Dunn said the train inspector would always check the carriages to see if they were clean enough. She said: 'He would go through the train after you were finished, run his finger along the top, by the adverts and check for dust. 'If you hadn't done it properly he would tell you off.' Mrs Dunn met her late husband, Robert, while working on the train. She added: 'My late husband was a traffic controller at Baker Street. 'I used to have to phone his office every day to let him know what stock we had - and what we wanted back. 'We met, we had a coffee and within 12 months we were married.' The ground-breaking line had been built and financed by a . private company, the Metropolitan Railway, to link the mainline stations . at Paddington, Euston and King’s Cross with the business district of . central London. The very first underground railway journey took place through the new tunnels of  the . Metropolitan line between Paddington and Farringdon, which are now part . of the Circle & Hammersmith Line.

Sexsomnia: Actor Simon Morris, 42, pictured, who is accused of raping a teenage girl told Cardiff Crown Court that he had no recollection of the alleged rape . An actor who claimed he had 'sexsomnia' to try and wriggle out of accusations that he raped a teenage girl has been jailed after a jury refused to believe his story. Simon Morris, a bit-part actor who appeared in a film with Michael Caine and in the . TV soap Hollyoaks, attacked the 15-year-old after she drank cocktails at . a birthday party. Morris, 42, was found guilty of raping the drunken teenager after helping her to pour champagne for guests. Hours later her sneaked into her room at 6am after she collapsed. When arrested he initially refused to believe that he had sex with the girl until police presented him with DNA evidence, Cardiff Crown Court heard. He told jurors: ‘I have a history of sleepwalking, checking my phone, gyrating against door frames and having sex with partners in my sleep. It’s quite embarrassing but I once engaged in sexual activity with a recent ex-girlfriend. ‘I climbed on top of her in the middle of the night in a blank state. I have also had partial sex with my current partner and gyrated against her leg.’ He told the court he had undergone tests at a sleep clinic in Edinburgh to ‘try to understand’ his condition. Morris was examined at the Edinburgh Sleep Centre to discover if he has sexsomnia - the medical condition where people engage in sex acts while still asleep. Psychologist Chris Dzikowski, director of the centre, told the court: 'I placed electrodes on his head to monitor his sleep patterns in the laboratory. 'He sat up and moved unusually, grinded his teeth and had noticeable and sharp hand movements. 'I found that the features were consistent with sleepwalking. 'It is a possibility that in this case he was suffering from sexsomnia - I cannot exclude it.' But Morris was found guilty of rape by a majority of 10-2 and unanimously guilty of assault by penetration. Judge Daniel Williams told him: 'You have been convicted of two very serious offences and you are facing a substantial custodial sentence.' Sue Ferrier, prosecuting, called his sexsomnia claim a ‘feeble excuse to escape the inevitable’. She said Morris met the teenager in September 2011 at a birthday party, where she had been given two glasses of champagne when she arrived. ‘Morris took an interest in her – winking at her, helping her pour drinks and even offering her to stay with him in London,’ said Mrs Ferrier. ‘The girl got drunk on cocktails and her father put her to sleep in an upstairs room. Morris then checked on her after she was sick and carried her into another bed. ‘The girl’s father tried to wake his daughter at 6am to go home, but as she was fast asleep he left her in the bed for the night.’ The girl’s statement to police described how she woke soon afterwards to see Morris standing in front of her, touching her sexually. He had sex with her before leaving, when the ‘full horror’ hit, her statement said. Court: Morris is accused of raping the teenager at a party after she had been put to bed by her father. The prosecutor told the court that Morris had winked at the girl and asked her to stay with him in London during the party . Morris told how he was ‘petrified’ to . be handcuffed and arrested later that morning. He said: ‘I’m too much of . a gentleman, I wouldn’t even do this to my worst enemy.’ He added that . he did not believe they had even had sex until he was presented with the . DNA evidence. Morris’s . current girlfriend, Helen Cole, is standing by him and told police he . once tried to have sex with her while he was asleep. Morris appeared with Michael Caine and Andy Serkis in the 2000 film Shiner and on Hollyoaks in 2001. He also appeared on the West End stage during his acting career, which lasted between 1996 and 2006. He later set up a consultancy firm which has since folded and he has also acted as an escort to celebrities. Morris blew a kiss to his girlfriend as he was led to the cells. He will be sentenced in the New Year.","Simon Morris, 42, described history of having sex with partners in his sleep .

Jody Latham, 29, wept in court as he was told by a judge that his 'sophisticated' production of the drug at his former girlfriend's house could only warrant a prison term. His tears of anguish turned to relief though when he learned the 12-month sentence would be suspended for two years. Latham, who recently dated the X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos,  pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing at Burnley Crown Court to production of cannabis between March and May last year. Police seized 24 plants at a former girlfriend's home in Stacksteads, Lancashire, as tests later showed 16 of the plants had matured and were capable of being sold for up to £9,000. Habitual cannabis user Latham told the court he grew the plants because he was worried that buying from dealers would attract attention with his celebrity status. Judge Beverley Lunt told the former EastEnders star the simple solution was not to buy cannabis in the first place. She warned him he would be brought before her if he committed another offence and he would then lose his liberty. 'I hope this will you deter you from offending and make you give up this drug,' she said. Latham, who found fame when he played . Philip 'Lip' Gallagher in Channel 4's Shameless and later as pimp Rob . Grayson in the BBC1 soap EastEnders, has a number of previous . convictions, including two cautions for offences involving cannabis. In 2006 he was cautioned for possession and in 2007 he was similarly cautioned for cannabis production on the Isle of Man. He was convicted of assault in 2003 and for using threatening words or behaviour in 2007 and 2010. Sarah Statham, prosecuting, said the Crown was prepared to concede that . on the evidence the defendant's production at the address in Acre Park, . Stacksteads, was 'capable of being used to supply to friends and nothing . more'. Fangs for the memories: Jody Latham and Tulisa Contostavlos pictured together in September when they were dating . She said police received a report of a disturbance at the house on the evening of May 13 last year and then were later told Latham had allegedly assaulted his then girlfriend, mother-of-three Sarah Melia. Further inquiries found Latham in a drunken state in the street and he was arrested on suspicion of assault, although Melia later told police she not wish to make a complaint. Police uncovered the small cannabis factory when they searched the house. Miss Statham said: 'It was a relatively sophisticated production set up with timers and lighting equipment. Steamy: The pair first met when Jody co-starred in Tulisa's steamy video for Sight Of You . 'An officer also stated there was hydroponic equipment as well.' Melia, 31, of Bacup, admitted, at an earlier hearing, permitting the drug to be produced. Wayne Jackson, defending Latham, of Market Street, Bacup, said his client had invested £1,500 for the growing of the cannabis but it was not as a business. 'He accepts he has been a very foolish young man bearing in mind he has a very promising career ahead of him,' he said. 'I met Latham a number of years ago in Bradford. He was a very calm, collected young man. 'The young man I saw here today is a sharp contrast to that.' On his own admission Latham had been smoking cannabis 'on and off' since he was 16. 'Foolish young man': Jody pictured alongside his co-stars in Eastenders last year . He knew he had a problem that needed to be addressed and he was due to attend The Priory clinic at the weekend as an outpatient. Latham was 'fearful' of a prison sentence as he knew that future work in his career could dry up as a result, said Mr Jackson. A large number of testimonials were handed to Judge Lunt. Mr Jackson said: 'What people say about him is that he is a decent man at the core. He needs to tap into that decency and try to put all this behind him and live a law-abiding lifestyle. 'He is a young man with great potential. It is about time that he realised that.' Latham was also ordered to perform 100 hours of unpaid work in the community. Melia, who has no previous convictions or cautions, was given a 12-month community order and told to perform 40 hours of work. The judge told her she had a responsibility for her children who lived in the house at the time, and had acted under the influence of Latham and out of 'a sense of misguided loyalty'. Judge Lunt told her she was quite satisfied she would not be before the courts again.","Jody Latham wept as judge said crime could only warrant a prison term .

A mother of three girls had a hysterectomy only to be told by doctors afterwards that while she slept they had also aborted the son she had always wanted but did not know she was carrying. Suzanne Doherty, 42, woke after surgery to be told the baby boy she always wanted had been terminated. Mrs Doherty was left suffering from depression after the operation, performed at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro. Devastated: Suzanne Doherty, 42, had an operation for a gynaecological condition but was unaware she was 14 weeks pregnant . Heinous error: Mrs Doherty was only told she was pregnant when she woke up by doctors who explained a foetus had been found and terminated . She was unaware she was 14 weeks pregnant. Medical staff also failed to spot the unborn foetus, despite a consultant noting that Mrs Doherty’s uterus was abnormally large before the operation. The procedure meant the unborn baby died. Mrs Doherty was awarded £62,000 after the hospital admitted liability and a ‘catalogue of errors’. Rob Jones, the consultant gynaecologist at the hospital who delivered the Prime Minister’s daughter Florence in 2010, is currently being investigated for misconduct and has resigned and removed his name from the medical register. Blunder: Suzanne went to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro for a hysterectomy only to be told afterwards she was pregnant and they had aborted a son she never knew she was having . Some 1,500 of his patients are having their cases reviewed but it is not clear whether he was specifically involved in Mrs Doherty’s care. Mrs Doherty, who lives in St Mabyn, Cornwall, said the ordeal of the operation in 2007 sent her into a spiral of depression and she eventually lost her job as a result. She said: ‘I was told the operation had been a success but unfortunately a foetus had been discovered and that the foetus had been terminated. I was told with just the curtains pulled, so there were other people in the bay that heard what had happened. Famous: David Cameron's wife Samantha had their baby Florence at the Royal Cornwall in 2010 . ‘It shouldn’t happen in this day and age. There are so many checks. It shouldn’t get to the point where a pregnancy was missed.’ Mrs Doherty said that following the operation she was physically well but had ‘long bouts of quite bad depression’. She said: ‘I would go back to work and then I wouldn’t be able to handle it and I would be off again, which ended with me having to lose my job. Knowing the fact that we’ve got three girls and we could have had a son, that was absolutely devastating. ‘It has taken me a long time to get to the point where I have accepted what has happened. Happy: David Cameron outside the hospital spoke of how happy he was with the care his wife and baby received - but bosses admitted some terrible errors in the case of Suzanne Doherty . ‘The money we can use for the children. But that’s never going to bring my son back.’ Her solicitor, Charlotte Skouby, said: ‘Following the removal of our client’s cervix a 14-week-old foetus was discovered and the pregnancy diagnosed at which point, tragically, the pregnancy was no longer viable. ‘The responsible NHS trust admitted the fact of the inadvertent termination and that the diagnosis of the pregnancy could and should have been made at the point when it was still viable, thus enabling our client to go on to term and deliver a much wanted baby boy.’ Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust has apologised. Lezli Boswell, the trust’s chief executive, said: ‘I am deeply sorry to hear about any anxiety, pain or distress caused to our patients.’","Suzanne Doherty paid £62,000 in compensation after experts failed to spot the unborn child in her womb before the major operation .

A former Beaver leader appeared in court today accused of sexually assaulting a child during after-school activities. Jason Asthana, 32, appeared at a Crown Court hearing held at Brighton Magistrates' Court accused of inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity and two counts of sex assault on a child under 13. He denies the charges which allegedly took place on one boy between August 2009 and August 2010. Beaver leader Jason Asthana, 32, is accused of sexual offences against a child.  He denies the charges . At the time the alleged offences took place, Asthana was working as a leader of the Beaver Scouts youth club and as a helper at a tennis club in Sussex. Prosecutor Henrietta Pager told the court Asthana was the local Beaver leader and said: 'This is a case about the sexual abuse of a little boy.' She added: 'The first incident was at Beavers when everyone else had gone home. 'He told the child to take his pants down then took a photo of his private parts and told him not to tell anyone. 'The next time was at tennis club when the same thing happened again, although this time Mr Asthana took the boy's pants down.' Miss Pager told the court that at Beavers he also put his hands down the child's underwear and touched him. The court in Brighton where the trial of Jason Asthana is being held . The child did not tell anyone about what had happened for two years until one day his mother noticed he was distressed and asked what was bothering him, the court heard. The mother told the court she had taken her son out for a 'rare treat' of a McDonalds meal when he told her what had happened when he was in the Beavers the previous year. Holding back the tears, she said: 'I got into the car and he was crying. 'I said ""What's the matter?"" and he dropped a bombshell. 'He said ""Jason Asthana put his hands down my pants and took a photograph of me"". 'He just came out with it.  We hadn't seen Jason for a while. 'I didn't know how to deal with it at the time.  He was upset and agitated. 'I wanted it to be untrue, I was trying to find a reason why he said it.' She said her son told her: 'I hate Jason and I hate this world.' She told the court she couldn't tell her husband what had happened for a few days as she didn't feel he would be able to cope. The boy's mother told the court she eventually telephoned the school for help before reporting the crime to the police. A video recording showing a police interview with the child was also shown to jurors in the court.  In it the little boy said he felt 'weird', 'angry' and 'upset' after what had happened. He said he did not go back to Beavers after the incident as he told his mother it was 'boring'. The court heard Asthana did not answer questions in police interviews and denied the allegations.

Broadcasters will be subjected to spot checks to ensure children on television shows are protected from cruel treatment and inappropriate language, media watchdog Ofcom said yesterday. The decision comes after concerns about the welfare of youngsters in Line of Duty, I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here and Dick and Dom’s Hoopla. Ofcom said it would also give broadcasters a stern reminder about their duty of care towards under-18s. Scroll down for video . Trouble: The BBC has been criticised after Gregory Piper was allowed to play a gang member who attempted to sever a policeman's fingers with bolt cutters . Ofcom has found the BBC was guilty of . exposing a 13-year-old to gruesome violence and sexually explicit . language when he appeared on crime drama Line of Duty. During crime drama Line of Duty, child actor Gregory Piper plays a gang member and is seen attempting to sever a policeman’s fingers with bolt cutters. His character, Ryan Pilkington, repeatedly uses swear words and is also head-butted by the man he is torturing. In one scene during the BBC2 show, a police officer is heard using sexually explicit language as he interviews Ryan. The BBC defended the scenes in Line Of . Duty saying it had been in constant dialogue with the teenage actor’s . parents who were comfortable that he would not be emotionally affected . by the role. But Ofcom . said the teenager had appeared in scenes which had been ‘of a . particularly violent nature and included sexually explicit language’. 'It felt like someone kicked me in the guts': Charlie Brooks was devastated to learn that she missed seeing her daughter . It . said the programme, for which it received a single complaint, had . breached its broadcasting code which states that ‘due care must be taken . over the physical and emotional welfare’ of under-18s irrespective of . any consent given by a parent. The watchdog is also investigating . ITV’s I’m A Celebrity… for using Kiki, the seven-year-old daughter of . contestant Charlie Brooks, for a stunt, and children’s BBC show Dick and . Dom’s Hoopla, after a child was left retching following a challenge . which involved eating a mixture of apple sauce and mayonnaise. So close: Charlie's daughter was disappointed that she missed out on seeing her mother . The . regulator also criticised the BBC for not having someone directly . looking over the teenager’s interests and suggested the broadcaster . should have sought expert opinion on whether it was appropriate for him . to have taken part in the scenes. The two episodes aired in July. The decision to look into the use of . Kiki Brooks on I’m A Celebrity comes following the outcry from hundreds . of viewers who watched the game unfold. On . the programme Miss Brooks, 31, who is well-known for playing the role . of Janine in BBC1 soap EastEnders, and darts ace Eric Bristow had to . choose from a selection of doors that had treats behind them in this . year’s series of the jungle show. Bungle: Dick and Dom's Hoopla show was also slammed when a child began to retch on screen after being forced to eat disgusting food . The . actress did not know that Kiki, who had not seen her mother for 18 . days, was behind one of the doors in the challenge and missed out on the . reunion after picking the wrong door. Brooks later criticised the stunt and said it had been “heart-breaking”. ‘I signed up for this show, but Kiki didn’t. I didn’t want her to be so upset. I had no idea this was happening. It was my lowest point,’ she said. ‘My mum gave the green light for her to be there because it was an opportunity for Kiki to see me - and I think she thought she would.’ Viewers also complained, while campaign group Parents Outloud said: ‘To involve a seven-year-old is sinking to the bottom.’ But a spokesman for the show said at the time that a senior producer had seen ‘Kiki afterwards and she was fine’.","Gregory Piper played a violent gang member in hit drama Line of Duty .

The online store expects this December 25 to be its busiest after spending on the day trebled over the past five years, in part thanks to families trying out Kindles, iPads and tablets they have been given as gifts. The proliferation of smartphones, home broadband and other gadgets also makes it much easier to make a purchase - and the price-cuts will make logging on as tempting as another slice of Yule log. Santa's workshop: Amazon's distribution centre will be working at full pace as its festive sale begins earlier than ever . Amazon's deals will include clearance offers, discounted digital goods and ‘lightning deals’ – limited quantity, limited time deals. The retailer will also price-match 'real-life' shops across millions of products, in a sale that will start at 9am a week today and last until January 1. Bargains will include up to 80 per cent off apps, 67 per cent off six-month LOVEFilm subscriptions and reduced-price products including DVDs, toothbrushes and flat-screen TVs. Those who found a Kindle lying under the tree will be able to snap up buy-one-get-one-half-price accessories for their new toy. Sofa surfing: Kindles, smartphones and tablets are making it increasingly easy to make purchases at any time of year . Xavier Garambois, vice president of EU retail at Amazon, said: 'The digital revolution has certainly played a part in this growth and Christmas Day is our biggest day of the year for MP3 and Kindle Book downloads as many people are buying content for their new devices that they have just received. 'It’s not just digital items though. We are seeing purchases of everything from baby products to women’s clothing rapidly growing on Christmas Day. Many customers are shopping on Christmas Day in a way that has previously only been seen in the retail industry on Boxing Day.' Managing Director Christopher North added: 'Digital products are clear winners on Christmas Day due to the instant satisfaction they give of being able to read or listen to them immediately.' Amazon is following many other stores in making pre-Boxing Day Sales a new tradition. Last year, online shoppers spent £186million on Christmas Day, up from £153million the year before, with people logging on as early as 6am. Sales increase throughout the morning, rising to a peak at noon as people raced to buy before sitting down to Christmas lunch, according to an analysis by Halfords. Shopping then drops off steadily from 1pm to 4pm, and picks up again with only a slight slowdown around 8pm when the TV channels started their top shows. Online transactions then tend to rise from 9pm, peaking at 11pm, before sales fall steeply as satiated revellers crawl into bed.

More than one in ten Conservative voters at the last election now backs the anti-Brussels UK Independence Party, according to a poll commissioned by former Tory vice chairman Lord Ashcroft (pictured) More than one in ten Conservative voters at the last election now backs the anti-Brussels UK Independence Party, but many will return to the fold if the Government delivers on immigration, welfare and the deficit, a poll suggests today. Just a quarter of those considering voting UKIP name relations with Europe as one of the top three issues facing Britain, according to the survey commissioned by former Tory vice chairman Lord Ashcroft. He warned that the promise of an EU referendum will not be enough to reverse an increase in support for UKIP. The poll, based on interviews with more than 20,000 people, suggests that even among those voters who currently back UKIP, only seven per cent name resolving relations with Brussels as the single most important issue. The survey finds the issue ranks behind economy growth, welfare, immigration and the deficit for this group of voters. The poll suggests that UKIP will do ‘very well indeed’ in the European Parliament elections in 2014, after it finished in second place in 2009 with 16 per cent of the vote. A string of recent polls has put UKIP ahead of the traditional third party, the Liberal Democrats. But Lord Ashcroft said many voters viewed the EU polls as seriously as the Eurovision Song Contest. He said: ‘These voters think Britain is changing for the worse. They are pessimistic, even fearful, and they want someone and something to blame. They do not think mainstream politicians are willing or able to keep their promises or change things for the better. ‘For voters attracted to UKIP, complaints about immigration or the EU are often part of a greater dissatisfaction with the way they see things going in Britain: They told us that schools can’t hold nativity plays any more; that you can’t fly a flag of St George any more; that you can’t call Christmas Christmas any more; that you won’t get social housing unless you’re an immigrant; and that you can’t speak up about these things because you’ll be called a racist – but the mainstream political parties, they believe, are too in thrall to the prevailing culture of political correctness to do anything about it. ‘For those drawn to it, UKIP’s primary attraction is that it will say things that need to be said but others are scared to say.’ Lord Ashcroft said many voters viewed the EU polls as seriously as the Eurovision Song Contest, which this year featured Irish pop twins Jedward (pictured) Lord Ashcroft said a strong UKIP performance at the Euro elections in 18 months’ time should not be seen as a harbinger of ‘electoral doom’ for the Tories in a general election in 2015. ‘In our research people compared European elections to the Eurovision Song Contest; some cheerfully said that voting UKIP in these elections was just a way to “give Europe a slap”,’ he said. In what will be seen as a warning to Lynton Crosby, who ran Michael Howard’s immigration-focused election campaign in 2005 and is expected to return as an adviser to Mr Cameron in the New Year, Lord Ashcroft insisted that the Conservatives should not employ ‘dog whistle’ tactics to try to win back support. He said: ‘Ultimately, the battle between UKIP and the Conservatives is less about ideas, policies, or even values. It is a battle between the party of easy answers and the party of tough decisions,’ he added. ‘Those who want the latter need to be reassured that those decisions are right, and that they are bearing fruit.’","Survey of 20,000 commissioned by former Tory vice chairman Lord Ashcroft .

The husband of a woman who died hours after eating a curry, was forced to deny that he poisoned his wife's lunch during an inquest into her death. Lurdes Lopes, 35, who died last year . shortly after arriving at a London hospital complaining about . toothache, had acted 'suspiciously' following her re-heated curry lunch, . CCTV footage from her workplace showed. Her husband Sardar Khan was questioned by a coroner yesterday following evidence that Mrs Lopes had discovered his 'secret family' from a previous marriage in his native Pakistan. Possible cause of death: Mother-of-one Lurdes Lopes may have been poisoned by the microwave curry she had for lunch . Shortly before her death Mrs Lopes, who had a child from a previous relationship, had confided in friends that her husband abused her and had once pushed her in front of a car. When prompted to leave the marriage she replied that her husband would kill her if she asked for a divorce, Westminster Coroner's Court was told. In the hours before her death on December 22 . last year Mrs Lopes had eaten a microwave curry for lunch and CCTV footage from her workplace in Kilburn, London show her health . appearing to rapidly deteriorate. Detective Sergeant Lynda Smith, who . studied the CCTV footage . said she ‘could not exclude suspicious circumstances’ . ‘The first thing I notice is that she . wipes her lips with a tissue like there is something annoying her, she . is wiping it more than if there was just something on her mouth. ‘She carries on working and there are certain frames where she touches her face, rubs her chest around her stomach. Open verdict: Mrs Lopes had confided in friends that her husband abused her and would 'kill her' if she asked for a divorce, Westminster Coroner's Court heard . ‘Towards the end of the day she appears as if she is getting ready to leave with everybody but she appears to fall against the doorframe. She seems fine in the morning and she is in discomfort after she has eaten.’ Later that evening Portuguese-born Mrs Lopes, of Maida Vale, west London, . went to St Mary's Hospital with her husband complaining of a . severe ache in her right jaw. She was told to call a dentist but as Mrs Lopes dialled the number she collapsed to the floor and began foaming at the mouth . Doctors rushed to her aid and tried to resuscitate her, but she was pronounced dead at 9.40pm that night. Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox questioned Mr Khan about the day of his wife's death, but Mr Khan denied allegations that he was in any way involved in her death. He denied being abusive towards her and insisted she had known of his family in Pakistan and was ‘happy’ in the marriage. When posed with the straight question as to whether he put anything poisonous into his wife's lunch he replied: 'No madam, no'. Sudden death: Mrs Lopes collapsed and began frothing at the mouth shortly after her arrival at A&E at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London . Speaking through an Urdu interpreter he . said: ‘I had told her everything before our Muslim marriage, we were . happy and she was happy.’ An initial post mortem found that Mrs Lopes died from a heart attack, but after viewing the CCTV footage the Coroner's Court ordered a second post mortem to be carried out. Dr Nathaniel Cary, who carried out the second post mortem, ruled out myocardial infarction but said he could not reach a cause of death. No toxins were found in her blood, but the court heard how many poisonous substances are very difficult to trace and that the investigation had been hampered by the fact that Mrs Lopes' stomach contents and much of her blood had been disposed of before the second post mortem was ordered. Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox delivered an open verdict and said that the CCTV evidence was ‘very suggestive that some poison may have been within the food’ but that she could not be sure of this. She said: ‘I cannot exclude suspicious circumstances but I have no positive, direct evidence of anything suspicious in this case.' The case had been referred to police after the initial opening of the inquest and although Mr Khan was questioned no action has been taken against him.","Lurdes Lopes died at St Mary's hospital after complaining about toothache .

Bargain hunters looking for Christmas presents have been stripping shelves bare at doomed Comet stores today - the High Street giant's last day of in-store trading. Shoppers queued outside one of the stricken retailer's shops in Leicester waiting for doors to open this morning as the company called time on 79 years of sales. Shelves were left empty this afternoon as the store offered discounts on remaining stock and dejected workers were seen dismantling display units and taking down sale posters. The final store closures come after Comet became the latest big name casualty of the recession, slipping into administration last month. Scroll down for video . It's over: A dejected employee sits on empty shelves at a Comet store as the shop fittings are dismantled ready for final closing . Sold out: The empty Comet store in Greenwich at the last day of trading . Slim pickings: Customers literally take the final products off the shelves at Comet in Greenwich today . Waiting in line: Shoppers queue outside this Comet store in Leicester this morning looking for last minute bargains . Final countdown: 'Everything must go' signs are torn down as this store in Solihull ran out of stock . Sad: The Comet store in Solihull lies empty this afternoon . Today's closures have left the taxpayer with a bill of nearly £50million despite the private equity firm, which . bought the electrical retailer for a nominal fee of £2 less than a year . ago, being likely to walk away with almost exactly same amount - £49.7million - . according to a report by administrator Deloitte. The . circumstances surrounding the company's demise will now be investigated . by the Insolvency Service's investigations department it was announced . today. Following its collapse, Comet’s accounts show it has insufficient funds to cover redundancy payments to its 6,600 staff with the Government now responsible for paying staff their last pay cheque. And a further £26.1million is lost in tax to HM Revenue & Customs, which is an unsecured creditor and receives nothing. The Government is therefore nursing a combined £49.1million loss. The circumstances surrounding the collapse of the company are to be examined by the investigation's branch of the Insolvency Service which will cover the run-up to administration and Comet’s takeover by a private equity-backed investment vehicle in February. Empty: Everything has already gone from the Greenwich Comet store . Desolate: A worker wheels electrical goods across an empty shop floor at a Comet store in Leicester . Liquidation: A shopper eyes up a late Christmas present at Comet in Leicester . It is understood that the investigation is a matter of course and will check that the processes behind the firm's fall into administration was handled correctly. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, said today: 'We can confirm that the Insolvency Service has launched a fact finding inquiry under section 447 of the Companies Act into Comet Group Ltd. 'The purpose of the inquiry is to investigate the circumstances surrounding its insolvency and to establish whether further action is required. 'We are not in a position to comment further at this stage. To do so could prejudice the outcome of the investigation and any future action. Final preparations: Workings at the Solihull branch take down sale posters . Bare: The shelves in Greenwich this afternoon . Mess: Products lie strewn on the shelves at Comet in Greenwich as customers search for bargains . 'The Department for Business is already reviewing the overall insolvency regulatory framework, to see whether it remains fit for purpose in today’s environment.' The Government's £50million loss on behalf of Comet comes despite the fact that there still assets worth almost the same amount in . the business, but under the terms of the administration they belong to . OpCapita, the controversial private equity firm run by founder Henry . Jackson. The . multi-millionaire American, who is married to Canadian-born pop singer . Stacey Jackson, managed to put his firm at the front of the queue of . creditors after taking over the chain of 240 stores eleven months ago. Drowning sorrows: This sign was taped in the window of a branch of the electrical retailer Comet in Bristol today . This . is a legal practice used by investment firms to ensure they lose as . little cash as possible when they buy troubled businesses and the rescue . fails. The firm received a £50 million dowry from Kesa as part of the acquisition of the chain and continues to own Comet’s warranties business, which is not in administration. The vehicle was also repaid a £9.5 million loan prior to the collapse. Meanwhile, the thousands of ordinary . customers who still own £4.7million-worth of unused gift cards and . vouchers remain on the list of unsecured creditors. Those who paid by credit or debit card will be protected by their card companies, but the rest will get little or nothing back. City sources say it is unclear whether OpCapita will make a net profit from the debacle. While . Deloitte shows the company technically lost £95.7m with revenues . slumping by £200million in the year to April, it is impossible to work . out how much of this comes out of OpCapita’s own pockets. It emerged that the company lost a . further £31 million in the subsequent five months as credit insurers . lost confidence and withdrew support for the business. Much of the £145.4million owed by Comet when it went into administration will fall at the door of its banks and investors. The . closure of the final group of 49 stores from the former 236-strong . estate comes seven weeks after Deloitte was appointed as administrator. Closed: The shutters are coming down on the UK's last remaining Comet stores today. This one in Nottingham has already closed for the first time . Best buys: The last few items of stock have been brought to the front of the doomed store in Basildon, Essex . Fire sale: This Comet store in Reading, Berkshire, slashed prices of its remaining stock by up to 60 per cent off . Farewell: A shopper in York looks pleased with himself as he leaves the Comet store on the last day of trading . The collapse of the firm, which was founded in Hull in 1933 and employed 6,895 people, marks one of the biggest high street casualties since the demise of Woolworths in 2008. Deloitte has failed to find a buyer for the company or any of its shops. Comet was hit by weak high street trading conditions and fierce competition from online rivals. Its suppliers could not find insurers willing to cover goods delivered should Comet default on its bills. The environment for credit insurance became tough and was withdrawn forcing OpCapita to pay for all its stock upfront. As the crucial Christmas period approached stock levels peaked, making it impossible for the firm to find the necessary cash to buy stock. In particular, it was knocked by the lack of first-time home-buyers, who had been key customers for Comet.
